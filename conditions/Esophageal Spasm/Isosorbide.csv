0,Isosorbide,Esophageal Spasm,1,,"June 30, 2018",10,"I have no pain but at a swallow test was diagnosed with esophageal spasms along with a small hiatal hernia. I am having a lump-like feeling in my throat when I make saliva, but not when I eat or drink. I was prescribed a half of a 30 mg tablet daily. I have taken twice and got a headache, but not a really bad one. Iâ€™m wondering if I even need to take it.",Wendy
1,Isosorbide,Esophageal Spasm,10,,"June 22, 2009",100,This medicine has saved my life after months of having chest pains everyday. I became weak and felt like I had nothing to live for. The doctors ruled out my heart and ruled I had esophageal spasms. They had tried other medications that did not work. My gastroenterologist gave me the time released IMDUR. IT HAS GIVEN ME MY LIFE BACK IN JUST OVER A WEEK. I HAVE MY ENERGY BACK AND I AM HAPPY TO SAY NO CHEST PAIN. THE ONLY SIDE EFFECT IS A HEADACHE BUT I CAN HANDLE THAT WITH TYLENOL. I HAVE MY LIFE BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH.,nana903
