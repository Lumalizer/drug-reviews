0,Clonazepam,Seizure Prevention,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 25, 2021",10,Klonopin (clonazepam):At 12 years old I was diagnosed with epilepsy after grand mal seizures. It took years of being on numerous epilepsy medications throughout the years. I am 47 years old and finally a different neurologist got the right combination of 2 medications that has changed my life in a very positive way. I take Lamictal twice a day (each 200 milligram tablets) The Lamictal alone wasn’t enough for my epileptic condition. My neurologist added the Klonopin 3 times a day 1 milligram tablets) and bingo this is what has kept me seizure free. I wish I never had to take Klonopin as it makes me so tired but I will deal with that verses having a grand mal seizure. It boggles my mind that this is considered a controlled substance as I think who the heck would want this? Who the heck would want to feel tired? Who would actually enjoy taking this if they didn’t have to? Unbelievable. Not fun at all by any means. My neurologist adding the Klonopin with Lamictal nailed down my epilepsy condition.,Anonymous

3,Clonazepam,Seizure Prevention,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 5, 2020",8,"I have been suffering from uncontrollable  hypnotic jerks at the point of falling asleep, triggered by the use of antibiotics. The first time this happened in 2012, I went through a few inappropriate psychoactive drugs before hitting on clonazepam - which worked straight away. I started at closed to 2mg, and used it for 3 years before coming off it completely.A month ago my GP gave me a different class of antibiotics for tonsillitis, and the same thing happened, to my dismay. I used my leftover clonazepam to stop the sleep jerks, which is a kind of seizure. This time round I started at 0.5mg and over a week had to increase to 1mg. It’s just about working.... but I may have to increase to 1.5mg. I take it once a day half an hour before bed time.It’s not a drug doctors like to prescribe but for me, what works, WORKS.

I started with 1.5 mgs.  then went up to 4 mgs. I have been on Klonopin ,Clonazepam for 32 years! I noticed it stopped working but I had to take it or no sleep at all. I finally went to a specialist for sleep. I got off of it but too fast 4 weeks went thru withdrawals went back on. Was getting used to Gabapentin. I decided to trick my body into not missing it. I taper down but I take 5-7 weeks in between dropping the dose. It has taken me 6 months to get below the halfway mark but a made a mistake this drop and 6 weeks later still feeling it. I only took 35 days....and I now know I should have lowered the amount I am dropping. I was dropping .5. Klonopin has a long half-life it takes about 3-4 days before the body registers it and about 2 - weeks to adjust depending on dosage and time. I might feel this for up to 2 years after last dose. I am hoping a slow taper will help lessen that.",Scarr

It has given me freedom as I carry it everywhere and have it is by my bed and in my bathroom in case I have an aura - I usually have time to grab this medicine and it will help me relax and stop a seizure before coming on.

None of the traditional RLS meds worked for me and my symptoms only worsened.  Finally, I ditched my old doctor and went to a new doctor.  I explained what was happening to me in detail and she quickly said ""that's not RLS, those are myoclonic seizures"" related to a right temporal lobe brain tumor I had several years ago"".  She called a neurologist and he said to try me on clonazepam or valproic acid.  I started on Clonazepam and it was like a miracle.

9,Clonazepam,Seizure Prevention,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 18, 2019",24,Klonopin (clonazepam):I have been on this medication for like 8 years and it works great for me. When I start to have panic attacks or my nervous system is on overload I take 1 to 2 mgs and it instantly calms my nerves. I did have an episode where my refill was due and the pharmacy kept faxing my old doctor so due to me changing doctors I went about 6 days without it and ended up having a seizure for the first time in my life. I bit my tongue up and it really scared me. I can take up to 2 a day but I on somedays can go without.  So I do when I can. I take them as prescribed. Anytime you you feel like you need more..you beat it by decreasing your in take. I refuse to have another seizure! My neurologist recommends I stay on the medication BUT I take as needed. You can fight through addiction if you are mindful about the way your body feels and just accept that some days you will  not feel very good but by taking the recommended dosage is way better then nothing at all.,Keepingitreal

It was like a miracle medication, to me. It got me through the 2 years of therapy and changed my life for the better. I was severely depressed and when I first started my talk therapy sessions, all I could do was cry, this medication helped me to realize that I didn't need to think so negativity about myself and my life. It took away my anxiety and helped me when I would have panic attacks, which was rare but did have a few.

13,Clonazepam,Seizure Prevention,10.0,,"November 16, 2018",20,Only thing that helps me. I suffered a lot before finding this drug. I don’t like drugs or taking them. I resist taking anything even an Advil even if I really need it. But this is the one I can’t really talk badly about. The only bad part is I’m scared to come off it if I wanted to one day. But any epileptic medication withdrawal is said to be just as bad. I take the lowest 0.25 mg dose daily for 5 years and didn’t have to increase. I’m just scared one day I will need to increase or have to withdrawal. But we can’t live in fear guys. Just don’t abuse this drug and use it only if very needed. I suffered for 20 years before finding it. I don’t like when people try to bash me for it when they don’t know what it’s like to have almost literal extra electrical currents in the brain.

I had had them consistently before  Klonopin and were a very scary part of my life.  I've had them since I was four.

23,Clonazepam,Seizure Prevention,10.0,,"January 12, 2017",21,"Would not recommend for those with only generalized anxiety. To me, this pill calms the synapses in the brain in order to control seizures...as it does for me. It will not have the same effect on people who do not have overactive, sharp brain waves which cause epilepsy, period. However, if taken to calm the synapses, I see no harm in taking this medicine. I've been taking it for over 2 years now for my seizure control, and haven't had to up my dose from 0.5 mg once daily. It makes me feel normal, calm, safe, and unparanoid. Taken in moderation, and for reason that requires care brain wave wise, this can really help you...as it has me. People with epilepsy are wired differently than those of only anxiety or insomnia.

50,Clonazepam,Seizure Prevention,10.0,,"October 3, 2010",17,"Excellent. Haven't had one seizure since I was switched to Klonopin(Clonazepam). It helps with my car accident injuries which I did not expect and not only with the broken bones but almost as an antidepressant, better than Paxil, that I was given and didn't make me fell more relaxed. I sleep well again because I don't take pain medicines even though the doctors prescribe it. Highly worked for me. Start out at a low and comfortable dose if you can't afford to be drowsy at work, etc. Tell your doctor and slowly he will bump your dosage up until you are comfortable.",Yohan Jourgemsen
51,Clonazepam,Seizure Prevention,10.0,,"June 11, 2010",26,I was prescribed 2 mg Klonopin 4 x daily since October 09. It has worked wonders for controlling my anxiety and as a bonus I've had no seizures since being on the medication. I take Tegretol for seizures which helped cut down the frequency but not stopped. Since I combined taking the Klonopin with Tegretol I've been seizure free for 8 months. The longest period since 2002 and also am completely anxiety free. Thanks.,batista

53,Clonazepam,Seizure Prevention,9.0,,"November 20, 2009",17,"I have used Clonazepam for about a year now. I am more relaxed and can concentrate better, with better sleep patterns. The only side effect I have had has been waking up in the morning feeling ""stiff"" (as if I slept too soundly). This disappears once I get up and move around. Note: I am a multi-tasker and find it hard to lay down at night and ""shut everything OFF"". I hope this helps someone.",chips1930
54,Clonazepam,Seizure Prevention,10.0,,"October 27, 2009",13,"Clonazapam (1-3 mg daily, mainly at bedtime) benefits me in many ways. Since it was added to my daily medicines 5 years ago, it has helped to completely eliminate my noctural Grand Mal seizures, anxiety and panic disorders, bipolar and ADHD (with an emphasis on the Hyper). I have not developed a tolerance (although I can see how that could happen), have no withdrawal symptoms when I miss doses. It provides subtle yet effective relief with no noticeable side effects. Thanks to Clonazapam I fall sleep without fear of seizures.",Rx2009

I've been taking Klonopin for 15yrs and only had to increase the dosage from 0.5mg to 1.5mg over this period. I take it at night and have no side effects that I can tell. Hope it keeps working as it does now.,Sleeping again
