0,Diazepam,Seizure Prevention,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 5, 2019",10,"I have used diazepam medication for over 35 years. It has for me proven to be the most effective going!! I am so tired of this medication or something like it becoming harder to get thanks to our federal and local government!! Putting it the way the MD,s say along with the same way I feel our doc's take a oath ""TO DO NO HARM"" Well they tell me that it's sad that now they are required to be told by someone who may or may not have a high school diploma and they don't know medicine let alone every patient is different!! I am so tired of jumping through hoops just to get the medical treatment I desperately deserve!! I could go on and on but I don't know if just this'll do any good for you or myself.",Mike
1,Diazepam,Seizure Prevention,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 20, 2018",8,I have had crippling seizures my whole life! They have stuck with me and been a curse as they happen at random I will become dizzy fall to the floor and start convulsing uncontrollably. Sometimes they have precursors like my body starts to twitch and shake and I get dizzy. I know to lay down at this point and to take my medication.  Throughout my 30 years of going through this Valium has been the only medication that has ever prevented the seizures and kept my seizures at bay,RJ

3,Diazepam,Seizure Prevention,8,,"January 9, 2012",25,"Valium (diazepam):This seems to help the pre-seizure ""twitchiness"" my spouse experiences, and has the side benefit of helping him to sleep. Also when he gets really agitated before hand, it seems to adjust his mood and make him feel more comfortable. Dose is small, 5 mg as needed.",Anonymous
4,Diazepam,Seizure Prevention,9,,"March 26, 2009",16,"Valium (diazepam):I have had seizures from a kick to the head. For 6 years, they started out giving me Valium and it worked great for the prevention of the seizures for about 4 1/2 years. Then it was no longer effective. They had to switch me to Klonopin, another benzodiazepine, but that is working for me now.",Anonymous
5,Diazepam,Seizure Prevention,8,,"March 27, 2008",22,"Valium (diazepam):Whenever a doctor prescribes me Valium it works like a charm, but I don't have seizures too often. Maybe twice a year.",Dotomanydrugs
