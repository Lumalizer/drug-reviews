When I began taking it, I erupted in a burning facial rash so we scaled the dose back. Since then, my days begin with vertigo/severe fatigue, my vision has become blurry (optometrist saw no literal vision changes during testing), I have tremors periodically, my short term memory is practically non-existent, difficulty concentrating, my limbs feel weak/tingly, and I'm still having seizures! I've been doing all sorts of tests and haven't been diagnosed with a new health problem. Why do anticonvulsants all cause so much misery? I'm essentially a stiff, wobbly, forgetful zombie on this medication. I'm really sad that it isn't working, because I heard it was a tried and true medication. My neurologist is weaning me off, thank god. I wish there was something out there that actually worked and didn't crush you under the weight of debilitating side effects.",zzz

Since I've been on Lamictal, I haven't had seizures (taking it 2x/day) but man... I'm having struggling with the myriad of side effects. I'm only 30, and ever since I introduced prescription meds into my life - I have SO many ""health"" problems. Other than my seizures, I had zero physical problems prior to being on meds. Now I have insomnia, my vision is blurry, muscle spasms/vertigo in the mornings, my coordination sucks, I'm always lethargic, and I get tongue-tied and slur all the time. I also got a severe rash on my face and neck the first week I was on Lamictal. But the worst part? I can't remember ANYTHING, can't concentrate, and I'm zoned out all the time. The cognitive impact is negatively impacting me at work and is causing frustration within my relationships. It feels like I just can't win with anticonvulsants. Is all of this really worth it?

I had undiagnosed partial seizures in my sleep, as well as absence seizures during the day. At 22 y/o I began trying several medications (Topamax, Keppra, etc.) and had terrible side effects (weird dreams, sleepiness, aggression).I am on 500mg of Lamotrigine daily. I do have mild forgetfulness and slight trouble with words on occasion. It doesn't bother me and it is worth it. I no longer have seizures and my mood has improved. It took a few weeks for my body to get used to. I would be wide awake and never get tired. But after a little while my sleep returned to normal.Bottom line, I can't imagine my life without Lamotrigine. I recommend it above all other seizure medications.",Kay
3,Lamotrigine,Seizure Prevention,10.0,,"September 16, 2020",5,"My pharmacy (and likely yours) changes the manufacturers of generics regularly to get the best price that year. It turns out that sometimes the best priced medications are not therapeutically the same. Unichem makes lamotrigine that maintains my drug levels and prevents my seizures. A seizure results in the temporary loss of driving privilege. Truly, you don’t want to seize while driving and hit someone. The restriction continues for six months. If you can’t imagine it, imagine being sixteen again and staying out too late one night with your parents car. They ground you for six months. It’s like that. Especially for seizure meds, insist on the same manufacturer every time you get your prescription filled.",MBD
4,Lamotrigine,Seizure Prevention,2.0,,"August 17, 2020",5,"I was 17 y/o when my doctor put me on this lamotrigine medication to treat my Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) which had been acting up at the time. After a couple days on the meds I started feeling sick and got little mini jerks but nobody was around to see them so I wasn't sure if it was the epilepsy or if it was in my head. I told my doctor next time I saw him I wanted off the medication. He then told me the meds were safe and tripled my dose. The next couple of months, I couldn't get out of bed in the morning without having seizure after seizure. Eventually it led to a grand-mal and only then would my neurologist see me about it. Unfortunately I found online that its a pretty common thing for others with JME to have this experience taking lamictal. My doctor didn't explain these risks to me, and if he had I would have exercised my right as a patient to refuse the treatment based on how the meds were making me feel and this never would have happened. If you are reading this and are unsure about lamictal, just steer clear.",Emma

Prior to the medication, I would throw a temper tantrum if I didn't get a cookie when I wanted it. I would become violent and bite my parents and spit in their face when they would restrain me.

This has caused some mood swings and nausea, but I think I will get used to it.  I take 200 mg morning and night. Previously I was on Tegratol and put up with some nasty side effects. This drug worked much better with fewer mood swings. I would like to reduce lamotrigine and use medical marijuana, which would have far fewer side effects.

I had it removed in 2016. I was on dilantin and it made me feel horrible. After my surgery in the hospital I had a seizure 3 times and they came in increments of 3. I was then put on Keppra with Dilatin. No good. My moods went crazy. Then they switched me to Lamical with a low dose of dilantin eventually weaning off of the dilantin. I was put on 400 mg of lamictal. Just recently I had a bad seizure and now they increased my does to 600mg. It is working but I feel very disconnected and spacey.
