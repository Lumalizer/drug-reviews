0,Topiramate,Seizure Prevention,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 16, 2021",0,"Topiramate has saved me both terrible migraines and focal seizures caused by a TBI. Starting low and slow is important 25mg once a day for a week then twice a day and increased as needed but my 3x per day seizures stopped and I haven't had a migraine in 10 months since starting it. My hair is getting thinner, I'm taking biotin and silica; I still have headaches managed with braids; and I do search for words and stutter some, but it's totally worth it to not have the debilitating migraines and I've only had 4 breakthrough seizures in 10 months so that's pretty darn great...and I've lost 25 lbs comfortably.",Tsalagi
1,Topiramate,Seizure Prevention,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 9, 2021",1,Topamax (topiramate):I switched from Keppra to Topamax because of my seizures and I lost around 25 lbs. I went from 147 to 120 in only 2 months. It was working for my seizures but I was eating so little that I ended up in the hospital. I collapsed and I was throwing up for 4 days straight. I was so weak I needed help to brush my teeth or even walk. Every morning was terrible. I don’t know how this medication is approved. I was in the hospital every day for four days getting fluids. After that I was basically forced to eat. It was hard but I was so weak due to lack of food that I had to eat every 2 hours. I've been off Topamax for about 2 weeks and I still have a hard time finishing my food. I get nauseous. I'm getting better but when I was on Topamax I literally could not smell food without gagging. Unless you’re extremely overweight I do not recommend this medication at alllll.,camila
2,Topiramate,Seizure Prevention,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 29, 2020",6,"Topamax (topiramate):I was prescribe the Topamax 25mg 2 times daily as a result of severe and disabling attacks of Vertigo.After 3 days of taking this, my memory got so bad that I could not remember if I had even taken my medication 5 minutes later. My mental thought process was totally negative to the point that I was in belief life was over.By the 5th day, I realized that I had become very defensive, aggressive, verbally abusive, and had no empathy nor regards for others. My PTSD was in the danger zone and I had become the monster I had fought daily for decades to control.Two days after totally quitting; which I can't say is recommended for everyone, my head is clear, my memory is normal again, and I am in disbelief that I allowed such a dangerous medication to even be prescribed to me.",Dizzy
3,Topiramate,Seizure Prevention,10.0,,"May 19, 2020",3,"I have sleep related seizures which results in me screaming out, jumping in fright, shaking and biting my tongue/lip/cheek. Since even taking the lowest dose as the starting point of 25mg, my sleep is totally calm. It’s so nice to not wake in fright during the night with blood in my mouth or to be screaming so loudly my voice is hoarse all morning. I used to awaken some nights thinking that someone was shaking my bed to shut me up - but it must have been my shaking which vibrated the bed. Also my appetite is greatly reduced (bonus!) and I have no interest in that sneaky afternoon glass of wine to relax. My afternoon coffee is just fine! The medication takes a few weeks to adjust to and you must start on the lowest dose and very slowly increase over time - you are much less likely to get that foggy feeling. I think it’s a miracle medication & I love it!",KP

6,Topiramate,Seizure Prevention,2.0,,"February 15, 2020",10,"Topamax (topiramate):After weaning off the old med and onto the Topamax he was taking (1000mg twice daily) he is a tall skinny guy but at 6’5 weighs around 190-195. He was on the prescription for 6 months. .shouldn’t you request to see him sooner considering how significant his med switch was? He dropped down to 160 pounds , but still had small episodes.  He was desperate to make them work and overall wasn’t sure when to actually call the doctor with issues because he didn’t want to be a bother. Problem is these meds weren’t prescribed very well and he just threw him on them without having baseline tests (blood, recent MRI) etc to base his switch on. He has now been switched again to the acid one as well as cepra (sorry spelling I’m not sure) but this is the fourth medication he’s been on,   But yes the topomax isn’t great for already thin people, and also the side affects heavily affected his speech and ability to think clearly (he sounded drunk half hour after taking them)",Saram21
7,Topiramate,Seizure Prevention,7.0,,"September 10, 2019",2,"So I don't just use this for seizure prevention, I use it for migraines as well. I'm only giving it a 7 out of 10 because while it has stopped me from seizing so often, I'm still twitching uncontrollably at times (which aren't seizures, they're twitches) and I'm still having my cluster headaches which leave me with vertigo attacks once the migraines pass, and as you can guess... when that happens I have to stop whatever I'm doing entirely and just go home. My days are still 100% dictated by my head injury that's frankly, unpredictable.No miracle drug and I never expected it to be. I'm still going to take topiramate. I need to if I don't want to end up unconscious in public again. But I don't know if it's the medicine or the doctors who refuse to take me seriously. It doesn't help enough. I'm still tethered to both this and 4 to 6 tablets of 200mg of advil on a daily basis to keep pain at bay.",Dentz

I took it for seizures, but it also helped me loose weight. I went on the keto diet at the time to help with epilepsy, and I think it made it a little easier. I’m not sure how it helped seizures. I took it for a year, having seizures 2-3 times a month, then switched to a different med and seizures are extremely rare now. It really dumbed me down and made me exhausted.

10,Topiramate,Seizure Prevention,1.0,,"April 24, 2018",15,Topamax (topiramate):After day one of topamax I felt strange. Generally sick. Very nervous. Aggressive. And then very depressed. I kept taking them. My appetite decreased as did my energy levels. And I was over thirsty all the time. Some abdominal pains and areas of numbness. Particularly of the face. Mouth. Eyes etc. Then I broke out in massive bruises. Very dark large haematomas on. My arm. I also had bone pains in my lower back and legs. I felt like I was being POISONED to death. So I stopped taking topamax after a month. After two days I already am feeling much better. This should not be allowed on the market. Again. Topamax feels like a very cruel lethal drug/poison....

I couldn't spell or form sentences. I had slurred speech and my eyes were glazed over. I also had mild anxiety the whole time I was on it. The only good thing was that I literally had no appetite and lost a lot of weight.  I only took it for about ten days week and went back to Lamictal.

Everything came to a heads about four months after I began taking the medicine, when I couldn't remember how to say ""Bye"" to my dad. I would have rather had seizures EVERY day than stay on Topamax!
