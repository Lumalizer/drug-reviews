0,Valium,Seizure Prevention,8,,"January 9, 2012",25,"This seems to help the pre-seizure ""twitchiness"" my spouse experiences, and has the side benefit of helping him to sleep. Also when he gets really agitated before hand, it seems to adjust his mood and make him feel more comfortable. Dose is small, 5 mg as needed.",Anonymous
1,Valium,Seizure Prevention,9,,"March 26, 2009",16,"I have had seizures from a kick to the head. For 6 years, they started out giving me Valium and it worked great for the prevention of the seizures for about 4 1/2 years. Then it was no longer effective. They had to switch me to Klonopin, another benzodiazepine, but that is working for me now.",Anonymous
