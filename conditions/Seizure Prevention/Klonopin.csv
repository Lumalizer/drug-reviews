0,Klonopin,Seizure Prevention,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 25, 2021",10,At 12 years old I was diagnosed with epilepsy after grand mal seizures. It took years of being on numerous epilepsy medications throughout the years. I am 47 years old and finally a different neurologist got the right combination of 2 medications that has changed my life in a very positive way. I take Lamictal twice a day (each 200 milligram tablets) The Lamictal alone wasn’t enough for my epileptic condition. My neurologist added the Klonopin 3 times a day 1 milligram tablets) and bingo this is what has kept me seizure free. I wish I never had to take Klonopin as it makes me so tired but I will deal with that verses having a grand mal seizure. It boggles my mind that this is considered a controlled substance as I think who the heck would want this? Who the heck would want to feel tired? Who would actually enjoy taking this if they didn’t have to? Unbelievable. Not fun at all by any means. My neurologist adding the Klonopin with Lamictal nailed down my epilepsy condition.,Anonymous

Was dizzy for a year felt like rubbish and got high anxiety from it. Still have anxiety caused by stopping this drug. Dr say it may take years before symptoms are gone. I was a zombie while taking this drug. I say stay away from it.,ru
3,Klonopin,Seizure Prevention,1,,"October 29, 2019",12,"Klonopin was great  for my seizures until it wasn’t. I have seizures in my sleep. I started with 1.5 mgs.  then went up to 4 mgs. I have been on Klonopin ,Clonazepam for 32 years! I noticed it stopped working but I had to take it or no sleep at all. I finally went to a specialist for sleep. I got off of it but too fast 4 weeks went thru withdrawals went back on. Was getting used to Gabapentin. I decided to trick my body into not missing it. I taper down but I take 5-7 weeks in between dropping the dose. It has taken me 6 months to get below the halfway mark but a made a mistake this drop and 6 weeks later still feeling it. I only took 35 days....and I now know I should have lowered the amount I am dropping. I was dropping .5. Klonopin has a long half-life it takes about 3-4 days before the body registers it and about 2 - weeks to adjust depending on dosage and time. I might feel this for up to 2 years after last dose. I am hoping a slow taper will help lessen that.",Scarr
4,Klonopin,Seizure Prevention,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 15, 2019",8,I really liked this medication at first. No bad side effects way better than other meds I had tried but after a few weeks started too get very depressed don't know if it's worth taking,kat
5,Klonopin,Seizure Prevention,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 4, 2019",29,"Good seizure prevention/rescue drug,and the only benzodiazepine whose primary indication is an anticonvulsant.I ve been at  2mg three time a day for over 10 years with no problems whatsoever.",Seizure control
6,Klonopin,Seizure Prevention,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 18, 2019",24,I have been on this medication for like 8 years and it works great for me. When I start to have panic attacks or my nervous system is on overload I take 1 to 2 mgs and it instantly calms my nerves. I did have an episode where my refill was due and the pharmacy kept faxing my old doctor so due to me changing doctors I went about 6 days without it and ended up having a seizure for the first time in my life. I bit my tongue up and it really scared me. I can take up to 2 a day but I on somedays can go without.  So I do when I can. I take them as prescribed. Anytime you you feel like you need more..you beat it by decreasing your in take. I refuse to have another seizure! My neurologist recommends I stay on the medication BUT I take as needed. You can fight through addiction if you are mindful about the way your body feels and just accept that some days you will  not feel very good but by taking the recommended dosage is way better then nothing at all.,Keepingitreal
7,Klonopin,Seizure Prevention,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 21, 2018",27,I've been on 2mg 3 times daily for the last 10 years for seizures and haven't had any problems with the drug. I've let myself run out in the past a few times and the withdrawal is mild compared to powerful narcotic analgesics such as Oxycontin or methadone.,Ron

9,Klonopin,Seizure Prevention,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 8, 2018",25,"I have a seizure disorder that isn't epilepsy. I had an incidence where I had seizures back to back for days and was sent to multiple hospitals to try to help me. When I finally came out of them, I was on klonopin and keppra. Keppra alone wouldn't stop them from happening again is what I was told by medical. I also read about klonopin and know that it is prescribed for preventing seizures and happens to be good at stopping seizures that happen quickly back to back, or whatever it was that was going on specifically with me. I am glad something worked. I have never had anything so rough and weird happen to me. I love klonopin bc I also have anxiety and insomnia, both things that klonopin helps and eases as well, which also could be triggers for seizures, or symptoms of.",dj1purity

13,Klonopin,Seizure Prevention,1,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 22, 2016",29,"This medicine made me confused, slur my words, exhausted. I was basically living in a fog for over five years. No amount of sleep helped, I needed to take a nap every day and would still be tired when I woke up. I had difficulty thinking, repeated sentences, had anxiety attacks. This medication is only suppose to be given for a maximum of 2 weeks. It's highly addictive and the user develops a high tolerance. Long-term usage can result in brain damage and benzos are the most overly prescribed drug in the world. Withdrawal was horrible, but worth it! I got my life back after getting off of it and I don't have anxiety or seizures, changed my lifestyle, diet and exercise.",Vest04

15,Klonopin,Seizure Prevention,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 31, 2015",30,"I was prescribed clonazepam by a VA psychiatrist because I was having jitteriness from an anti-depressant (Paxcil).  He prescribed 2/mg/day.I had been having seizures - later diagnosed as psychogenic non epileptic seizures - for several years, and while taking clonazepam the seizure frequency was reduced, and almost completely stopped.All the regular epilepsy medications tried had NO effect, only clonazepam has been effective in reducing or stopping my seizures.Paxcil, strangely, made me increasingly violent until I stopped it.",Spirit7
16,Klonopin,Seizure Prevention,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 29, 2015",18,"During the time I have been on Klonopin, I was asked by my insurance to try the generic but was never able to tolerate it.Last October 2014 the brand was unavailable ""Not in Stock"" and I had to go on the generic.  I was on it totally for several months and had some severe side effects.  I became aware that brand was available in early June and was able to get back on brand.  Having difficulty getting the exact same dosage I've been on for about 18 months to regulate.  I'm having a problem sleeping thru the night and feeling anxious when I wake up.  It doesn't feel like the same drug.  I don't know why it was stopped.  I wonder if anyone else has had the same experience with taking the ""new brand"" since it is  available again.",bellson44
17,Klonopin,Seizure Prevention,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 19, 2013",52,I have taken Klonopin for at least 20 years now and it is the only medication that prevents absences and myocloptic seizures. Sometimes I have breakthroughs but not often. I vary in my doses from 1 mg a day to 3 mg at times due to needing a little more or less. Since I have been on it for so long I am able to do this. I take it at nighttime because I cannot function during the day if I take it in the morning.  I think I have been on every seizure medicine there is and have had nightmare stories concerning them but Klonopin works the best for me. I believe every person is different and what works for one may not work for another. I do have to put up with occasional side effects like bouts of insomnia and breakthrough optical migraines.,singingmeadow
18,Klonopin,Seizure Prevention,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 26, 2013",71,"I was prescribed this 6 months ago by an ER doctor after my first ever tonic clonic seizure.  I'd been taking it for about 6 weeks before I could get an appointment with a neuro Dr.  I was working, had no problems at all with it - actually was helping me sleep better and I didn't have any other seizures.  The Dr took me off them & said it wasn't the right medicine.  I tried 2 medicines by his suggestions and changed Dr's after bad reactions.  The new doctor had me on 3 others that also gave me bad reactions - GUESS WHAT - now I'm back on them and I'm feeling like myself again & I'm not having any trouble at all.  I just wish they would've listened to me to begin with.",sallymaebooth
