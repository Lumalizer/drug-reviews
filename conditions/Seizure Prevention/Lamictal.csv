0,Lamictal,Seizure Prevention,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 18, 2022",2,"The longer I'm on Lamictal, the more problems I have - I'm taking it for nocturnal seizures (I had 1-2/yr before meds). When I began taking it, I erupted in a burning facial rash so we scaled the dose back. Since then, my days begin with vertigo/severe fatigue, my vision has become blurry (optometrist saw no literal vision changes during testing), I have tremors periodically, my short term memory is practically non-existent, difficulty concentrating, my limbs feel weak/tingly, and I'm still having seizures! I've been doing all sorts of tests and haven't been diagnosed with a new health problem. Why do anticonvulsants all cause so much misery? I'm essentially a stiff, wobbly, forgetful zombie on this medication. I'm really sad that it isn't working, because I heard it was a tried and true medication. My neurologist is weaning me off, thank god. I wish there was something out there that actually worked and didn't crush you under the weight of debilitating side effects.",zzz

After 19 years, now taking 25 mg Lamictal 1x or 2x per day maintenance dose, I established through trial and error that Lamictal causes a temporary stiffness or numbness around the mouth and eye of the left side of my face,  the vision is impaired.",Joe
2,Lamictal,Seizure Prevention,10.0,,"January 24, 2020",26,"Diagnosed with complex partial seizures in the right lobe of my brain. My mother had full epilepsy. I was 6 when diagnosed the diagnosis was determined after taking a 24 hour continuous EEG by me wearing a small backpack monitor and the needle sensors in my head with a protective covering cap. Prior to the medication, I would throw a temper tantrum if I didn't get a cookie when I wanted it. I would become violent and bite my parents and spit in their face when they would restrain me. The neurologist surgeon said by taking the medication for only two years I would grow up and not develop epilepsy. After taking meds from the very beginning I never had another violent temper tantrum. I took the meds for the two years never experienced any side effects.  I am now 21 years old .",Hereditary epilepsy guy
3,Lamictal,Seizure Prevention,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 6, 2020",109,My sister died   today due to side effects from this drug.  It is ruthless.  She lost 2 layers of skin over 90% of her body as it caused  Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis.  She was bandaged from head to toe and blood seeping through the bandages.  Though claimed this outcome is rare.  I encourage you to consider other options.  My sister was healthy and today lost her life due to the side effects of this drug that should not be on the market.  Think twice.,Marc

For the first 12 I had similar symptoms as others - poor memory, exhaustion, inability to walk a straight line.  No idea why but now my symptoms are slowly going away.  My dizzy spells are rare, straight lines aren't difficult and best of all my memory is coming back. It's not as good as  before I was on the meds, but I'm happy for anything I can get.  My issue is that I'm soon going on Medicare and the cost of this medicine is $12,000/yr.  I'm looking into generics and based on the research it seems they have gotten better, but I'm not ready to make the leap yet.",G
6,Lamictal,Seizure Prevention,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 27, 2018",25,My daughter started this drug at night time with the lowest dose.  2 weeks later we added another dose in the morning.   On the second day she started having more seizures (absense) in the morning where as before she had maybe 20 but with the medication it was in the hundreds.   I told her dr and they wanted us to just double up the dose at night time.   I wasn’t ok with that but kept her on the  1 chew pill at night.  The next day she has a convulsion seizure which she had never had before.   I don’t like this medication.  I think it caused more seizures for my 6 year old little girl.,Mermo

Initially it made me really drowsy but it was manageable. Otherwise I've had absolutely no problems! Only downside is that its levels can be easily affected/lowered with other drugs.

I was put on Keppra 750mg 2x a day. In 2015 I was diagnosed as Bipolar. I was put on Lamictal 100mg 1x a day. I've had many EEG's and MRI over the past 2 years, most recently November, 2016. I just met with my Neurologist last week and he said that my latest EEG confirmed, yet again, I have 'abnormal electricity full brain every 4-5 seconds', which I've had since birth. Now I have to do an Ambulatory EEG for 3 days/nights and bloodwork. Urrggh!!!Somebody please wake me up from this nightmare! Questions - Why Lamictal for Bipolar when it's for seizures? Why a 3 day EEG? Why Keppra & Lamictal?",Urrggh!
11,Lamictal,Seizure Prevention,6.0,,"January 13, 2017",23,I was diagnosed with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in my left parietal part of my brain in 2015 after I had a stroke at 21. I had it removed in 2016. I was on dilantin and it made me feel horrible. After my surgery in the hospital I had a seizure 3 times and they came in increments of 3. I was then put on Keppra with Dilatin. No good. My moods went crazy. Then they switched me to Lamical with a low dose of dilantin eventually weaning off of the dilantin. I was put on 400 mg of lamictal. Just recently I had a bad seizure and now they increased my does to 600mg. It is working but I feel very disconnected and spacey. Its helping with seizures but not liking the side effects. I am now looking into a device called Responsive neurostimulation (RSN). looking for alternatives but so far lamical works,Jaz_4

It has done a miracle in my case I am virtually 100 % seizure free. No noticeable side effects in my case except dreams in 1st week, as I remember when I started 11 years ago. In 2011 I stopped taking it as I thought I don't need it any more but I had a fit again very soon, so I started again immediately. In 2012, I tried to be over smart and reduced its dose to 25 mg 1 OD, but soon afterwards I had another episode though it was less intense and I controlled myself. Since then I never thought again to discontinue or reduced its dose, I take it each day every day religiously honestly without a break like my breakfast every morning.",imtiazkhan

14,Lamictal,Seizure Prevention,10.0,,"April 12, 2016",78,"I went through study after study as a kid without diagnosis. I found out 6 months after I had my 1st child at age 22 I had epilepsy. The pregnancy increased my symptoms and seizure to 3-5 times a day. The first med they put me on was lamictal and I stayed on this med for 8 yrs without any distracting symptoms. After I divorced I tried to go off them due to no insurance, I soon realized how well they did work. I ended up going back on them within two months because my seizure ended up coming back as soon as the med eased out of my system. It has now been a combined 12 yrs on this med and I don't intend on changing anytime soon.

We started at around 600 mg/day,but gradually reduced this to 250 g/day,and then after a couple of small seizures this was upped to 300g and I now take200 g at night and 100g in the morning. My doctor says Lamictal dosage must be minimum 250 g  day to be effective, with a maxi dosage possible of 1 200 g / day.  We did try some Lamictal plus Keppra onthe way,but reverted tojust Lamictal and that was fine.  I have had very few seizures since I started - maybe once every3 years - but recently got 2 when I went to Australia and had had a 30 hour trip.  Stress and alcohol are linked to my attacks.

BUT as the years have passed, my memory has been going a lot and it seems to be getting worse and worse. I took it upon myself to stop the medicine cold turkey (I'd  been on for 5-6 years now so its NOT recommended).. and yet I haven't had any symptoms of a seizure and my memory is starting to come back.

21,Lamictal,Seizure Prevention,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 15, 2015",43,"My neurologist decided to try lamictal with me because of the inefficiency of topamax. As I was weening off topamax, he put me on 300mg of lamictal XR. After a few weeks, I was solely on lamictal and no more topamax. Yet, the first two weeks I had two seizures, so my doctor decided to put me on 1000mg of Keppra. I've had a few more seizures on lamictal and it was very random. I believe that lamictal is not beneficial by itself, but combined with another drug, it seems to help out. Although it helps a little bit, the side effects are fatigue, weakness and low appetite. These side effects weren't as bad as topamax, but they weren't the best. In the end, I've been seizure free for the last six months on lamictal and keppra.",Zane Dayton
