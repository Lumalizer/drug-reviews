0,Topamax,Seizure Prevention,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 9, 2021",1,I switched from Keppra to Topamax because of my seizures and I lost around 25 lbs. I went from 147 to 120 in only 2 months. It was working for my seizures but I was eating so little that I ended up in the hospital. I collapsed and I was throwing up for 4 days straight. I was so weak I needed help to brush my teeth or even walk. Every morning was terrible. I don’t know how this medication is approved. I was in the hospital every day for four days getting fluids. After that I was basically forced to eat. It was hard but I was so weak due to lack of food that I had to eat every 2 hours. I've been off Topamax for about 2 weeks and I still have a hard time finishing my food. I get nauseous. I'm getting better but when I was on Topamax I literally could not smell food without gagging. Unless you’re extremely overweight I do not recommend this medication at alllll.,camila
1,Topamax,Seizure Prevention,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 29, 2020",6,"I was prescribe the Topamax 25mg 2 times daily as a result of severe and disabling attacks of Vertigo.After 3 days of taking this, my memory got so bad that I could not remember if I had even taken my medication 5 minutes later. My mental thought process was totally negative to the point that I was in belief life was over.By the 5th day, I realized that I had become very defensive, aggressive, verbally abusive, and had no empathy nor regards for others. My PTSD was in the danger zone and I had become the monster I had fought daily for decades to control.Two days after totally quitting; which I can't say is recommended for everyone, my head is clear, my memory is normal again, and I am in disbelief that I allowed such a dangerous medication to even be prescribed to me.",Dizzy

3,Topamax,Seizure Prevention,2.0,,"February 15, 2020",10,"After weaning off the old med and onto the Topamax he was taking (1000mg twice daily) he is a tall skinny guy but at 6’5 weighs around 190-195. He was on the prescription for 6 months. .shouldn’t you request to see him sooner considering how significant his med switch was? He dropped down to 160 pounds , but still had small episodes.  He was desperate to make them work and overall wasn’t sure when to actually call the doctor with issues because he didn’t want to be a bother. Problem is these meds weren’t prescribed very well and he just threw him on them without having baseline tests (blood, recent MRI) etc to base his switch on. He has now been switched again to the acid one as well as cepra (sorry spelling I’m not sure) but this is the fourth medication he’s been on,   But yes the topomax isn’t great for already thin people, and also the side affects heavily affected his speech and ability to think clearly (he sounded drunk half hour after taking them)",Saram21
4,Topamax,Seizure Prevention,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 12, 2018",5,"Not sure about this drug. Started at 25mg 2x a day for 2 weeks, worked up to 50mg 2x a day. Still having seizures 1-2 times a day. Had it upped to 100mg 2x a day and now I don't have seizures but there's so much pressure in my head I feel like it's going to pop. It also makes my 2mg xanax ineffective, I've gone from sleeping 12hrs straight to maybe 2-3. I've lost 10 pounds but it's horrible to say I'd rather have a seizure to release the pressure and be chunky. Calling the dr in the morning.",Banshee
5,Topamax,Seizure Prevention,1.0,,"April 24, 2018",15,After day one of topamax I felt strange. Generally sick. Very nervous. Aggressive. And then very depressed. I kept taking them. My appetite decreased as did my energy levels. And I was over thirsty all the time. Some abdominal pains and areas of numbness. Particularly of the face. Mouth. Eyes etc. Then I broke out in massive bruises. Very dark large haematomas on. My arm. I also had bone pains in my lower back and legs. I felt like I was being POISONED to death. So I stopped taking topamax after a month. After two days I already am feeling much better. This should not be allowed on the market. Again. Topamax feels like a very cruel lethal drug/poison.... Don't take it.,Snagz

7,Topamax,Seizure Prevention,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 5, 2018",4,"My doctor put me on Topamax because I could no longer afford Lacmictal for my bipolar disorder. It was the worst experience of my life. It gave me a severe headache, loss of coordination -- if I was walking forward I would suddenly start waking on my tiptoes in a sideways direction. I couldn't spell or form sentences. I had slurred speech and my eyes were glazed over. I also had mild anxiety the whole time I was on it. The only good thing was that I literally had no appetite and lost a lot of weight.  I only took it for about ten days week and went back to Lamictal. I'd rather be poor than have to be on Topamax",Butterbean63
8,Topamax,Seizure Prevention,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 2, 2017",3,"Topamax, I’m not sure what a decade of using topamax has or has not caused, it is NOT reliably controlling siezures until I started ketogenic lifestyle, in fact the high fat diet has totally taken away my tremors in head that I felt on daily basis, my Clinic had me in for 5 days in hospital testing and determined to lower my topamax level upon leaving by 100 mg. I was on 400 and lowered to 300. Today I have depression fibromyalgia and most my ligaments or hurt.Joints feel like they are rock hard swollen and painful, I can barely use my thumbs anymore but I refuse to go to do tools for fear of more medication, they never find anything wrong but proof is in pudding, bulging achilles and wrists, right side pain every joint I have hurts ",Ketogenic lifestyle

Living a miserable life on this medication, cannot wait to get onto something else. Tried to give this a chance and it gave me nothing but a terrible time, almost like being unmedicated with a constant dead leg&arm, UGH. I'm a small person in general so the weight loss was not a welcome change either. Topamax does nothing!!! for my complex partials seizures or epilepsy.",mygcem

Before taking Topirimate, my seizures were uncontrollable. I would get 3-5 seizures per week. Not including the amount of injuries I sustained- fortunately, nothing serious, just bumps on the head and sprained ankles from falling over. But I've been so lucky. I've also lost weight. Amazing. I've wanted to lose weight for a while now. I've lost about 2 stone. But unfortunately the appetite suppressant within the Topiramate has ceased. It doesn't last very long. My appetite has come back :-( But the seizures have been greatly reduced. Which is the main thing, which I'm very happy about.",AshR00

My experience on Topiramate however has been fine. I lost weight like others seem to have, but have since put it back on. I surrendered my driving license for a year after the seizure but have since got that back. I carry out my job with ease as well so really can't complain there. The only issues I've had are the side effects of tingly hands and feet, sudden dizziness, becoming very, very tired all of a sudden - and more recently - losing my train of thought, getting confused easily and being unable to focus. I've noticed this mainly happens though when I'm bored and have nothing to do. When I'm busy, all works well.",Rebecca13

21,Topamax,Seizure Prevention,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 21, 2013",113,"This is for the Newbies out there. I started this medication when I was 15. Had my first seizure few days before before my 15th birthday. The first side effect you will experience is sleepiness, don't fight it. Let your body get a nap between 1-3, which I found to be the best time. I sleep for 1 hour and still can fall asleep at night. I am 21 now. Some advice to you, whenever you don't feel like eating I found that sweet tea gets me hungry, find that X factor in you. The weight loss is insane. I lost 40 pounds in 6 months just by breathing. Now, sleep patterns are important. If an average person needs 8 hours you and I need 9-10 MINIMUM also try to take the dose at the same time every day, you will fall asleep faster.
