0,Itraconazole,Tinea Capitis,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 4, 2021",0,"I was prescribed this medication for tinea corporis and I was taking another brand for 2 months and it wasn’t working too well. The fungal infection was controlled but not improving or going away, after which the doctor prescribed me the same medication from a different brand but this time a lesser dosage and it worked like a charm but it brought along a lot of side effects - excessive sweating, tiredness, disturbed sleep ( can only sleep 4 hours a day ) and the WORST side effect (for women) my periods completely stopped and because of which my hormones went out of whack and I got insane cystic hormonal acne which I have never had in my life. Nor have I ever missed a period. I just can’t wait to get it done with because I’m so tired of waking up to 3/4 pimples every single day",Mixed emotions
