0,Esomeprazole,Gastric Ulcer Prophylaxis,10.0,,"June 9, 2021",1,"I've been taken it over 20 years with no side effects I think. I have only just read up on the bad side effects and there are so many that I decided to come off them last week.  It was a  bad idea, so bad, I now have heart burn with vengeance which shut me down for the day and I needed a  60 mg dose to get it under control .So now I am  still taking my 20mg day every morning .",Duster05

2,Esomeprazole,Gastric Ulcer Prophylaxis,,,"September 20, 2015",2,"The dosage use of Nexium clearly states : ""This medicine is usually given for 4 to 8 weeks only. Your doctor may recommend a second course of treatment if you need additional healing time."" I do not understand some of the comments that state they have been using it for 20 years or 10 years !!! . and then complaint about secondary effects.I read the label and it states  ""24 HR""  which is how long it lasts but in very small letters  : "" May take 1 to 4 days for full effect "" It also says ""Treats Frequent Heart burn"". I will change my diet accordingly and use another Heart burn chemical. By the way meals prepared with ginger are very easy on the stomach.",Trabuco
