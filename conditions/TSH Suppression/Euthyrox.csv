0,Euthyrox,TSH Suppression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2021",3,Was  recently switched by my doctor to Euthyrox 88 mcg. So far so good and feeling good. No issues.  I used to pay over $100 every three months for Synthroid and now pay less than $10.  Also it's gluten free!,Martha58
1,Euthyrox,TSH Suppression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 27, 2021",3,"I started taking Euthyrox not long after it came out in 2019.  Its working as advertised and is packaged differently which I like.  The pharmacist told me that levothyroxine can be impacted by where we store it, like my bathroom.  This type of packaging apparently helps protect.  My numbers have improved and I like the packaging.",MJ
2,Euthyrox,TSH Suppression,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 8, 2020",40,I was given Euthryrox 50 mcg by Walmart instead of my usual thyroid medication.  My doctors did not request Euthryrox or that the medication should be changed.  I have been taking Euthryrox for 3 months and have experienced hives/welts on my left neck hairline and lower back.  I am also experiencing headaches that are  different than  other headaches along with joint and back pain.  I may be a coincidence but have requested Walmart to refill to my original prescription.,Lucky
3,Euthyrox,TSH Suppression,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 3, 2020",62,"I have been on levo since 2007 for TSH suppression after total thyroidectomy, my pharmacy switched to this type of levo replacement & it is an awful prescription. Within 3 days my chest had such tightness I was ER bound",BellBottomBlues
4,Euthyrox,TSH Suppression,,,"February 13, 2018",57,"I took Euthyrox 50 mcg to treat thyroid dysfunction. Six months into the program I developed severe joint pain in my hands and feet. Physicians misdiagnosed my joint paint as Gout. The pain became severe in a very short period of time to the point that it paralyzed my ability to do daily chores. Holding a cup, walking,  or turning the key inside the key hole was becoming a challenge. I have stopped the pill for about a month and over 90% of the symptoms are gone.",HHR
