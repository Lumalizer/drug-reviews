I suffer from thyroid problems and am currently treaded with pills. I  also have goiter,  fibromyaliga, RHA, osteo being tested for kupus (which is almost a yes for sure) panic disorder chronic. and several other minor thing. My body is in daily pain. I use 1500 cc of b12. this aides in pain relief. as well as mood enhancer also puts u down when ur too highly strung. It also keeps ur skin so pretty. I go weeks when sometimes I forget to take it and  my body to screams  ""please get me  the b12."" it seems to run ur nervous system. and pain. I take this to ease some parts of pain for what it works on. When the weather is nice 1000 cc a month. it seems to be keeping me normal. love it....",lorij119
