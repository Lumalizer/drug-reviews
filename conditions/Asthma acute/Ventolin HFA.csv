1,Ventolin HFA,Asthma acute,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 13, 2016",12,I have had asthma for 45 years. I started on this medication when I was very young. It's always worked very well for me. I have had physicians try to change it to something else but I always end up requesting they change me back to Ventolin. It just works.,Montry
2,Ventolin HFA,Asthma acute,5,,"May 17, 2015",5,"I have allergy induced asthma. Ventolin helps me breath better. Worked excellent at first then needed additional maintenance meds, Singulair and a steroid inhaler (Asmanex Twisthaler). I also take Allegra, Flonase, and Astelin to control my allergies and asthma.",Steve0376
