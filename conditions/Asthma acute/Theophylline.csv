0,Theophylline,Asthma acute,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 27, 2016",6,My asthma has been uncontrolled for years. I have tried everything under the sun to help. My doctor put me on theophylline....the first week I thought I would die from the nausea...then...wow...I was almost normal!!!!  I had not felt that great in forever!!!! I went back to my doctor...told him...his response...I'm sorry but I can't keep you on this medication.  I was so upset I couldn't even ask...why?  It was like a miracle for me. Now I'm back to suffering everyday of my life.,Ms. Serious
1,Theophylline,Asthma acute,1,,"November 5, 2015",4,"Quibron-T (theophylline):Having taken this vile, awful-tasting garbage growing up to treat my asthma, I would say it's about as effective as a placebo. It did absolutely nothing for my asthmatic issues. If one can avoid taking this, all the better. ",kb7rky
2,Theophylline,Asthma acute,8,,"June 25, 2010",23,Uniphyl (theophylline):My Asthma came back when I was around 45 years old.  My doctors couldn't find any medication that would help. It was so bad I couldn't go outside or open a door in the house.  I spent several hours taking breathing treatments each day.  Then I was given a prescription for Uniphyl.  Everything changed for me when I started taking it.  It is a miracle drug.,Anonymous
