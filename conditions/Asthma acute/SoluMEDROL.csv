2,SoluMEDROL,Asthma acute,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2018",8,"Helped tremendously. Was given as daily injection (by IV) before bedtime during treatment of severe episode shortness-of-breath requiring hospitalization. Reduced need for daily inhalators and restored breathing capacity. Has been two weeks since last dose without any ""COPD-Flare"" episodes. More effective than Predinisone (pill) for long-term control of condition.",Anonymous
