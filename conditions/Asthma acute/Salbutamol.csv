5,Salbutamol,Asthma acute,3.0,,"December 24, 2021",0,"Proventil HFA (albuterol):Kaiser changed my inhaler from Ventolin to Proventil, and what a definite decrease in quality. When I use Proventil, I could barely feel the medication enter my lungs and felt no change in my breathing. I had to use more than two doses to feel any recovery. This is the most uncomfortable inhaler to hold onto. This inhaler is simple like the inhalers I used 20 years ago. There is no counter so you have to shake and guess if you have enough for a full dose. The HFA weakens the strength of the push, but the Proventil has much less force than the Ventolin. I would rather pay more for better quality.",Djgal

The scary part is that they still sound as though they are dispensing medicine, but it is going up the canister, and not into the patient. I can imagine that people, especially children, could be harmed and unaware that they're not getting the medicine they believe they are.  It is a small inhaler, with a dose counter on it, which is great, but it is useless if it clogged and cannot help someone when it's needed.",ProAir

9,Salbutamol,Asthma acute,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 6, 2021",0,Proventil HFA (albuterol):I have used Ventolin for many years. Now Kaiser has switched to this brand. I have noticed a huge difference in this medication s ability to work as a rescue inhaler. I require more puffs to feel any relief. The pressure is very weak and requires a great deal of breath intake to get the medication in the lungs. This can be a problem when in an actual asthma attack. The box the inhaler was in states that it has a dose indicator. This is not the case. Obviously this medication is a cheaper older style medication. It may work for mild asthma or to prevent a possible attack. But I am afraid it  will not help me in a major attack.,DJG
10,Salbutamol,Asthma acute,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 18, 2021",1,"ProAir HFA (albuterol):Insurance just switched me from Ventolin to this generic ProAir inhaler.  This stuff is a joke and should be considered criminal to offer this as a solution for asthma attacks.  My asthmatic wheezing puts out more air than this inhaler could ever hope to do. The puff itself is quieter than someone laughing at a bad joke, exhaling out their nose. At least that person can breathe, unlike anyone using this inhaler. I'm sure this review is going nowhere, but I'm guessing whoever put this product out never had asthma or ever heard of it. Insurance companies are already awful, but to force this option and not cover something that works is ridiculous.",sean

Now I have to buy my Ventolin out of pocket at Walmart because I REFUSE TO USE PROAIR. You might as well not have a rescue inhaler at all because PROAIR DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

19,Salbutamol,Asthma acute,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 17, 2021",1,ProAir HFA (albuterol):I am not sure why anyone's complaining about this inhaler brand. I've had asthma ever since I was about 6 months old and have been with ProAir since it's release. I was switched temporarily to Ventolin but was put back on ProAir ASAP after having an asthma attack after taking a puff from the Ventolin inhaler.

21,Salbutamol,Asthma acute,4.0,,"March 14, 2021",3,"ProAir HFA (albuterol):ProAir has never worked well for me. It is albuterol just like Ventolin HFA, etc.  But, I have heard from many that ProAir is not as effective due to a different type of propellant in it. Now, to me this makes little sense. The reason why makes little sense is that IF the propellant that has been changd from the product is ""part"" of what helps the treatment of an asthma attack, it (the propellant) should not be replaced by a different propellant. The propellant that helps treat asthma SHOULD THAN be considered as an active ingredient that TREATS asthma. Since propellants have not been studied or claimed to be a treatment, it leads me to believe there is some OTHER unfounded reason for the ProAir not to work as well as other inhalers. Why? BECAUSE ProAir and many other ""emergency"" inhalers contain the same active ingredient; albuterol. I rate ProAir a 3-4 in effectiveness. I would rate other emergency inhalers that contain the same active ingredient, albuterol, as a 9-10.",Don

28,Salbutamol,Asthma acute,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 23, 2020",1,I’ve been an asthmatic for most of my life. I’ve taken just about every prescribed medication on the market. About two years ago my medication stopped working and I was feeling very strange - I remember thinking that I felt like I was dying. I have come to believe that the cause was a build up of all these mixed asthma medications in my system. I then remembered that many years back I had taken Albuterol Inhalation Solution in a nebulizer and had gotten better. I now only take my Albuterol medication in a nebulizer. The nebulizer is much more work but the results are much better for me. I do carry an emergency inhaler with me when I go out.

57,Salbutamol,Asthma acute,2.0,,"July 24, 2020",5,Was excited to get the new Perrigo inhaler because I wasn’t a fan of the other one the pharmacy was giving me large blue one with metered doses . But the way it’s designed you can’t even push the white one down .  And even though the spray seems better then the blue one .  It tastes awful like chemicals and plastic.   I have to say I buy the good ones from kiwi drug get about 6 for 60 bucks . Or  I have my friend get me some from Mexico if I relied on the the ones from the us pharmacies I would have asthma attacks all the time .,Lb322

It's the worse inhaler I have ever used. First, it is awkward to use and the inhaler has stopped giving out puffs on occasion. The taste is beyond horrible. It has a weird garlic like after taste. I am also wasting puffs when I have to press it repeatedly into the air to make sure a normal puff is coming out, since it usually releases a tiny puff. These need to be recalled.

I nearly threw up the first time I took it. For the next 30 puffs I couldn’t take it without having a strong flavored drink to chase it or I’d gag and throw up. But the worst part is that the inhaler fell out of my purse and onto the floor two days ago and stopped working altogether. It may dispense half a puff or a quarter puff and then nothing.I took the canister out to clean it because I thought it was clogged but now when I press down on it comes out the hole where the cap locks in! What?! I pay $50 a month for this and now I can’t use it with 130 puffs left! I’m hoping I can just switch the canister into an old red ProAir chamber and it works. The generic design is crap.,J733

66,Salbutamol,Asthma acute,1.0,,"May 19, 2020",5,ProAir RespiClick (albuterol):I'm allergic to the propellant in the CFC free Ventolin. I have to use a powder. I first used the GSK rotahaler with no problems. The powder is in a capsule that spun in the rotahaler as you breathe in. You knew if it worked or not. Breathing in the powder is no different to the puffer. It still has to get to your lungs. I saw a demonstration video of the Respiclick. I definitely DON'T want to use it.  The fact you have to open the mouth piece each time to take a puff would be incredibly dangerous in an attack when you're trying to breathe and also trying to open/click the thing. Non-asthmatics designed it as asthmatics know better. I use an Easyhaler. You have to press to release the medication but once again you have no idea if the medicine came out as you can't always feel it when you breathe in. I found myself checking whether it was still working and you're never 100% sure if you got any and how much you got.  I prefer the GSK rotahaler but they discontinued it.,Ascot

I feel it makes everything worse. How can it be a rescue inhaler if it's clogged up when you need it. It clogs up every 2 or 3 sprays. I'm in the ER quite a bit for my breathing.
