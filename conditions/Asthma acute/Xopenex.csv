0,Xopenex,Asthma acute,10,,"March 10, 2015",6,"Used as alternative to albuterol inhaler due to rapid heart rate after its use. Good for use during mild to moderate acute asthma. I use for mild asthma. If Xopenex inhaler doesn't completely work, I know it's time to step up treatment with regular nebulized medication & a doctors visit.",Anonymous
