0,Varenicline,Dry Eye Disease,10,,"March 14, 2022",1,Tyrvaya (varenicline):Tyrvaya 0.03 mg. So happy I have tried this. Finally I have relief from my dry eyes. No more burning and discomfort all day long! A few sneezes after I take a dose but that is all. My eyes are SO MUCH BETTER! Now I just have to convince my insurance to cover it.,Meanne
1,Varenicline,Dry Eye Disease,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2022",5,Tyrvaya (varenicline):It does sting a bit in the nostril and did cause me to sneeze once with each dose. Otherwise if you put your tongue on the roof of your mouth there is no drainage down your throat and thus no irritation. I had results in about 36 hours. I used in a trail so there was no cost to me.,Trial user
2,Varenicline,Dry Eye Disease,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 21, 2022",2,Tyrvaya (varenicline):Have had dry eye for a long time and finally was convinced to try this. Sneezed and coughed for half an hour. Horrible experience. Could not breath and all of my coworkers left the building for fear of COVID. It felt like pepper spray up my nose and the biting in my throat lasted all day. Never touching that toxic stuff again. Learned my lesson.,Long timer
