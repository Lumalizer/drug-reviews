All NSAIDS  help, but Meloxicam 15mg once per day was amazing after taking for a week. No pain. 6 months later I got COVID and (maybe a pure coincidence) it stopped working.",John
1,Mobic,Osteoarthritis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 16, 2021",5,I was started on meloxicam 5 weeks ago for bone on bone osteoarthritis in both knees. NSAIDs and topicals and PT did not help. Now I can walk in the grocery store with much less pain and sleep without my knee pain waking me up. Well tolerated so far. I am hoping this will help delay a knee replacement. I am taking 15mg per day,Elaine
2,Mobic,Osteoarthritis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 24, 2021",3,"This medicine does help a lot. I would say about 80% and when I came off 3 days later started hurting again and a month later was practically bedridden from pain. Yes, it works well!!   I stopped taking it one time  because of my severe GERD which I had before mobic but became worse with Mobic but now that I am on a PPI medication I don't have to worry about the GERD anymore. I just upped the antacids as needed. It is much better than suffering from severe pain. I am sensitive to medication but there is no side effects outside maybe some very minor drowsiness the first few days starting back taking the medicine. It has helped me. I have degenerative disks, compression in my spinal cord,  suspected AS as well as arthritis in all my joints and they are testing me for autoimmune issues. You may not even realize how much it helps until you stop taking it. I knew it was helping me a lot but didn't realize how much. It's a good medication and works much better then prescription Naprosyn.",BW2

5,Mobic,Osteoarthritis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 7, 2021",58,"About ten months ago, I began experiencing a lot of pain in my arms and joints, including my knees. Thinking that I had caught a virus (not Covid) I finally went to the Doctor who prescribed Mobic. I am in my 70's and have osteoarthritis in most joints. In fact, I had bi-lateral hip replacements, seven years ago due to OA, also both of my parents and grandmother suffered quite a lot from arthritis. My Mother told me that it 'moved around'. And, just when you think the pain is going, it hits another part of your body. Even my muscles were aching. Now, several months later, after taking just one box of Mobic, I am pretty much pain free. I hope it continues but I'll wait a few weeks to see. If not, I'll go back to the Doctor. I took just one 7.5mg tablet per day.",Crystal

Every morning I will wake up and have pain in my lower back and also feel pain as I turn sides in my sleep. My doctor prescribed Mobic 15 mg he told me to take it for 1 month. Yesterday I bought it and took it late before I went to sleep, I also ate something as they told me to take after my meal.

7,Mobic,Osteoarthritis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2019",126,"I have been taking Mobic for knee pain for 2 weeks. Within the first week I noticed fluid on my ankles and lower legs. Then three days ago I started getting itchy welts, on my breast, chest, stomach, arms and legs. They look very very similar to bed bug bites or flea bites and I know without a doubt I do not have ether one.  Yes it did wonders for my knee pain I was able to go to the gym and stand for a long time with no problem. I've now stopped the med because I would rather deal with my knee pain than the side effects, as they are worse then the pain. I am looking to see how long it will take for the welts to stop and go away the itching is unbearable!!!  I have taken Benadryl and using Cortizone cream I will be calling my doc in the morning. My over all opinion for this med is not to take it because of the side effects. I truly hope this helps someone that is having these side effects!",Ashleyjarrett

10,Mobic,Osteoarthritis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 14, 2018",40,"I was hit by a car over 10 years ago and have severe back pain because of it. I kept being prescribed opioids for the pain, but I can’t live like that so my doctor prescribed Mobic since I was taking to many ibuprofen a day and it obviously started upsetting in my kidneys. First, he gave me 7.5mg per day, but that wasn’t nearly enough, so he upped me to 2 a day. It makes me feel good, better than anything else I’ve ever taken for my back pain. However, if it only lasts an hour or two. If I wanted to be without unbearable pain all day I’d have to take more of them. But 2 works for now and it is wonderful!",Tt

Caution:  I didn’t know it was an NSAID and also took another NSAID -  Aleve (naproxen) with it. My entire body was bruised and I couldn’t figure out why at first. I’m lucky I made it through.  I only take it as needed when the pain is unbearable.,Severe neck & back pain

However, it gave me a headache and my other MD said Prozac can't be taken with Mobic because both increase the risk of gastric bleeding etc Also, it gave me shortness of breath.  I thought it reduced my pain but my doc says arthritis pain comes and goes, so maybe not.  Be careful if you also take an antidepressant - many don't react well with Mobic.",jloo

I've had Mobic prescribed by several different doctors over the past 10 years and 1) haven't had a problem with it, and 2) it's one of the only medications that helps with my arthritis, which I have in just about every joint but my elbows. Ibuprofen works too but I started retaining fluid and swelling up after taking it off and on for several years. Hope nothing similar happens w Mobic as it's a godsend.",Kvddhthc835

I was also diagnosed with a 5th metatarsal stress fracture. Apparently I had the stress fracture for at least a year but thought it was arthritis. I was prescribed 15 mg of mobic daily by a podiatrist for the stress fracture. Within 1 hour of taking it the pain was almost gone. I had been taking 600-1200 mg of ibuprofen on a bad day of flares, sometimes having to take naproxen instead Mobic allows me restful sleep but it does make me drowsy...I need 10 hours of sleep to recover. However I can take it every other day and it still works on both sharp and dull pain.
