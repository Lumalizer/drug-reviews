0,Indomethacin,Osteoarthritis,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 20, 2021",0,"I've used it for some months on high doses, at first tinnitus went away, however now I'm stuck with a really severe one that have been there for 6 month now, my life is pure misery because of this. If you start getting tinnitus quit while you still can, the ringing will go away the first times but the ear damage will eventually be permanent/very long lasting. BTW I'm 21",Max
1,Indomethacin,Osteoarthritis,9,,"February 12, 2019",14,"I'm taking a total of 150mg/day for moderate-severe OA. This medication has been a blessing. It takes about 2 hours to reach its peak pain relief, and lasts about 7-9 hours. Prior to taking indomethacin, my quality of life was kind of in the gutter...the things I enjoy doing hurt too much to do. This is when I felt the potential risks of indomethacin (notably, rare-but-serious GI and cardiovascular risks) were justified by the potential benefits. With the amount of pain relief this provided me, I feel good about this decision as I can now live my life on my own terms, for the most part.I have experienced side effects - insomnia and occasional dizziness. The severity of both has decreased with time. Taking the medication with a moderately-sized meal reduces this. I also take this with a few ounces of purified aloe vera juice (there is some, although not conclusive, evidence to suggest that this may provide a protective effect against the tendency of NSAIDs to cause GI inflammation.)",GetSwift
2,Indomethacin,Osteoarthritis,10,,"August 27, 2016",10,QUALITY OF LIFE HAS IMPROVED 100%. I have not experienced any side effects. There is a significant difference when I don't take them.  I was told to take three 25mg pills a day but I've been fine taking  2x a day. Sometimes only one a day. I need total shoulder replacements and the pain without these pills is extreme.,CHARLIN

4,Indomethacin,Osteoarthritis,9,,"May 29, 2008",59,Indocin (indomethacin):I started with 2 x 25 mg capsules a day. After 2 days I really feel my knees are out of pain. I hope the effect will remain after leaving the medicine.,SAJJ
