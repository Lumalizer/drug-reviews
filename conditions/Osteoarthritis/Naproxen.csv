I limit my tablets to avoid any side effects and they really ease the pain, after a couple of days I start feeling pain and stiffness and can hardly walk so I know my next tablet is due.  I think they are a great pain reliever . I am 73 and on good days very active…thank you Naproxen .",Mazza

2,Naproxen,Osteoarthritis,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 14, 2020",2,"I’ve been taking these naproxen on and off for years relating to joint pain. Most prominent in my back, feet and knees. I’ve finally said enough is enough. I might as well be popping candy. They are a complete waste of time. I get zero benefit from them but am fortunate that I don’t get any side effects with the exception of heartburn. I know several people that take them and no one can say in my circle  they are a benefit to them. I’ve now had to resort to Nurofen Plus which financially is crippling but they at least give me some very mild relief.",eljael91
3,Naproxen,Osteoarthritis,4.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 18, 2020",22,"I have been taking two 500 mg naproxen  tablets per day for several years due to osteoarthritis, back & knee pain. I had no side effects for a long time, but in the last 2 years I have had issues with the skin on the back of my hands. I am a farmer, so daily work with my hands around sharp objects (like Barbed wire) is a constant. I began to get cuts and small lesions on the back of my hands that were slow to heal and then left shallow red scarring.  I began researching my condition and came across ""Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced pseudoporphyria"". Symptoms of this condition exactly describes my condition. This is listed as ""a relatively rarely reported condition"", and therefore not commonly listed as a side effect of taking naproxen. I have discontinued naproxen and will be meeting with my Dr. to determine another anti-inflammatory for my condition. I hope this information helps so that someone who has this problem doesn't suffer for years with it like I have.",Ken

If I wasn't taking naproxen I couldn't walk to be honest. I'm waiting to have my spine fused due to my illness. My symptoms are back ache (gone) blood flow loss to legs (gone) severe tingles in legs (gone) numbness in hands and feet (gone) severe sharp pains on most movements (gone). For me this drug is great and I don't have the side effects as others have described. Give them a try it could work for you also, I wish you luck.",Connors

My left leg has always been shorter and I've had Osteopath treatment off an on, though pain has never stopped me leading a very active life. The pain now is appalling, Panadol and Ibobrufen help but I still limp painfully. Have a little indigestion as well. I thought weight-gain i was having was due to lack of mobility but it was bloating side effect due to the Brufen.  I can't take codeine so was prescribed Naproxyn as Ibobrufen wasn't cutting it for the pain. Naproxyn took a few days to even work and the pain was not alleviated enough to warrant putting up with extreme queasiness, flatulence, slight depression (Can't afford to start down a negative track before my operation with so much pain ahead!).

Checked blood count and did the rectal blood. Told my SO to get me to emergency now.   Blood count 7 and needed transfusion. Had endoscopy.  Released after 3 days -blood normal. Told to see gastro upon my release. Over the next week had colonoscopy, intestinal exam, and lastly capsule endoscopy - swallow a small capsule camera to film 8 hours going through my body.  Dr and I reviewed the results. Three places in intestines indicated bleeding - I could see them.  He asked me food or meds I was taking - Aleve had caused the bleeding as it is a  NSAID. I can't take any NSAID and nothing with aspirin in it or I may bleed.  So now I basically live w/o taking anything for pain.  ALEVE - Read the package - very small print - may cause BLEEDING.",Lee
