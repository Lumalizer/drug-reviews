0,Nabumetone,Osteoarthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 10, 2021",0,Relafen (nabumetone):Doctor gave me samples to see if this drug would relieve some of my knee pain caused by osteoarthritis. I took 1-2 1000mg tablets a day for a week. No relief whatsoever. I’m happy for the  people who did get relief but for me this drug did nothing.,MakoMike
1,Nabumetone,Osteoarthritis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 26, 2021",3,"Relafen (nabumetone):I was in a car accident back in 2019 where I received a compression fracture of the spine, lower lumbar area. Along with 1 herniated disc on the left lower side of the spine. Also an additional herniated disc on the right lower side of the spine, which was more of a serious herniation than the left one. After my car insurance coverage ran out for my chiropractic visits, I started to see a Pain management doctor who gave me samples of Relafen DS (1,000MG). It actually worked very well with the inflammation, stiffness, and swelling around my lower back. Highly recommend asking your doctor about taking this medication for your back pain.",jondrums22
2,Nabumetone,Osteoarthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 11, 2021",1,"I had a severe reaction to this drug. I initially thought it was a virus (but stopped taking the med). Chills, body, aches, fever, heart palpitations, headache, loss of appetite, stomach ache, exhaustion and strange sharp pains in my leg and head. Not realizing it was a reaction from nabumetone, I took one pill a few weeks later and had the same reaction, although milder.",MT
3,Nabumetone,Osteoarthritis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 3, 2020",5,"I had a really bad flare up in my right knee that lasted about three months. At first I tried meloxicam and that did nothing so up next was nabumetone. After the first week I didn’t really notice a change in the swelling, but I continued my twice a day dosage for another week and that’s when it started to work. It worked so good my knee eventually became numb and I couldn’t necessarily feel my knee. The swelling reduced and I was finally able to walk again. However, I did not like the way it made my knee feel because I damn near couldn’t feel it at it so I weened off of it slowly",Anonymous
4,Nabumetone,Osteoarthritis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 18, 2020",15,"Relafen (nabumetone):I'm allergic to nsaids but I've tried everything to get the pain & inflammation  of osteoarthritis under control, at least where I can tolerate it. I just got Rx for relafen 500mg today & took about 1/8 because I was afraid I would have allergic reaction.  I'm fine so far & I honestly haven't felt this good in years. I'm praying I won't have problems with relafen & I'll get back to the way I used to be!!",Bones
5,Nabumetone,Osteoarthritis,,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 16, 2017",17,"I have Scoliosis/Fused Back/Sciatica .This medication works wonders for me.  It makes the difference between functioning and not. Without the medication, I can barely walk and with the medication I can go to work and live my daily life. I’m not pain free but it makes it bearable especially since it has a long half life symptoms are controlled. This medication doesn’t work for everyone. If you don’t get relief within a week or so, I’d move on to another medication.",C B

7,Nabumetone,Osteoarthritis,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 26, 2016",35,"Relafen (nabumetone):I love relafen aka nabumetone. I have OA, chronic low back pain, and chronic pain syndrome. It works best of all prescription nsaids I have tried. And believe me, I have tried a lot. I've become allergic to some, some just plain don't work, or cease working over time. I have been taking nabumetone for over 3 yrs now, no need to increase dose, no side effects. I absolutely swear by it. It's very rare that I even need to take anything for break thru pain.",Anonymous
8,Nabumetone,Osteoarthritis,1.0,,"March 26, 2015",15,I was prescribed to help treat arthritis in my right big toe. This was after having had mild dizziness side effects from Voltaren (Diclofenac). Unfortunately  didn't work for me. It did nothing where at least the Voltaren (Diclofenac) relieved the swelling in the joint and allowed me to actually walk without my foot hurting.,RobTheBob
9,Nabumetone,Osteoarthritis,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 2, 2012",31,"I am a 53 yr old male, who worked in the timber industry for 35yrs now. I had 6 knee surgeries to a single injury in 1986. On 7/16/2012 I had my Right Knee replaced with a Stryker Triathlon Knee Replacement. I am working on getting my strength back. I was put on Diclofenac at 75mg 2 times a day, which sent me to the rest room 20 times a day. My Surgeon changed me to Nabumetone along pain medication almost like Lyrica (insurance would not pay for Lyrica. Since I have regained strength and am progressing faster than if I was on an OTC pain medicine. 6 weeks post op and walking pretty well and mostly pain free.",stack600

11,Nabumetone,Osteoarthritis,9.0,,"December 15, 2011",37,"I have suffered from osteoarthritis for roughly 8yrs now and am 35yrs old.  My condition effects me through out both legs, feet, mid back going down to the base, right shoulder, parts of my collar bone, left forearm, right wrist and parts of both hand and fingers as well as left thumb.My GP has tried a number of different medicines which include diclofenac, ketoprofen, naproxen and one other.   None of which ever helped and had bad reaction to the naproxen which caused really high blood pressure and pins and needles in both legs (sitting down or standing up).  I was taken off that after being on it for 11 months and as of Monday gone (today being Thursday) I've been put on nabumetone 500mg slow.  I'm sleeping like a baby and in less pain.",Anonymous
12,Nabumetone,Osteoarthritis,6.0,,"May 10, 2011",67,"Relafen (nabumetone):What started out as a simple back strain/sprain at 19 yrs old has, over the years, evolved into an all encompassing condition leaving me with Multiple Sclerosis, handicapped and needing a walker for any mobility. Through the years I have been on NSAIDs which have proven time and again to be so helpful in relieving pain to where I was taking 3200 mg of ibuprofen/day. Finally given Relafen, which has saved my stomach from all the pain medicines and ibuprofen. Have never had a problem with Relafen (nabumetone) over the 7 yrs I've been on them, and they continue to be instrumental in relief from daily pains due to MS. A great product!",frankietg
13,Nabumetone,Osteoarthritis,5.0,,"March 26, 2010",18,It works fairly well and  better than OTC or even prescription Naproxen. Not as well as Diclofenac in my experience.,Anonymous
14,Nabumetone,Osteoarthritis,7.0,,"August 23, 2008",122,"Relafen (nabumetone):As a 36 year old male suffering from osteoarthritis,this drug has made a substantial difference in my quality of life. I was not sure how long I would be able to keep working, now that I am being treated with this drug, my quality of life has increased greatly. I am able to work without severe pain. A definite plus is I don't have to worry about a narcotic cloudiness to contain my pain. I can now play and walk outside with my children. I am afraid of the side effects, but so far so good. Recommend this to others who may benefit from its use.",Anonymous
15,Nabumetone,Osteoarthritis,8.0,,"April 4, 2008",109,"Relafen (nabumetone):My arthritis was pretty much under control using naprosyn, but it started making my stomach bleed so I had to discontinue using it. I was in pain all the time and couldn't participate in my hobby of folk dancing and even had to use a cane increasingly. After about a year of this I began taking Relafen and it relieved my pain dramatically. It's still not as good as the naprosyn but it is a lot easier on my stomach.",Anonymous
