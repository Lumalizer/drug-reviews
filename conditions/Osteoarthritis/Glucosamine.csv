0,Glucosamine,Osteoarthritis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 7, 2012",35,"I have never been diagnosed with arthritis, and have no family history of arthritis. I am a 44 year old man, and have had some trouble with my knees since I was 16. I could always move my knee joints slowly and feel them creaking, as long as I can remember. I have always felt some pain with exercise, and my knees would creak, pop and sometimes even lock up a little when I go rock climbing, hiking, or work up and down off the floor. I began taking Glucosamine 2 months ago. I am supposed to take 2 pills a day, but miss most days. I noticed almost nothing the first month, but now have no creaking, no pain, and no fear of getting up quickly or bending my knees deeply.",Jim Guy
