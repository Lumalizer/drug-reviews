When I was younger an internal med doc put me on Voltaren the pill to calm down what another doctor had messed my body up with too many antibiotics. Voltaren literally saved my life. I don't know it people realise that the the manufacturer made the cap specifically for people that may have arthritis in their hands! Another stated he could not have to use it 4 times a day as instructed it says it may be used UP TO 4 times a day. Smell for me there is  none. My knee/sports doctor actually recommends this as I asked him today. Don't expect it to reverse your aging, as I am 63. But it does reduce the inflamation & pain. Try it.",Cterry

Especially hard to go to sleep smelling it, seems to take forever to dissipate.  That being said I've only been using this since yesterday and I do notice the pain in my knee has improved a bit.  The warnings are scary but a cortisone shot did not help me at all so I'm trying other avenues.  I'm optimistic about the gel, I like the fact it's a topical treatment allowing you to focus directly on the joint bothering you. If I continue to notice my pain lessening I'll stick with it.  Now, if they could just do something about the aroma.",travellife

The orthopod I saw yesterday took xrays and said I had severe osteoarthritis in the 1st joint- not the big joint at the base of the toe,He said the long-term fix is fusing that joint. He also said the joint is too small to inject. He prescribed diclofenac (brand name Voltaren) gel. Yes - gel. You rub in on and around the joint with pain 3-4 times/day.

44,Voltaren Arthritis Pain Gel,Osteoarthritis,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 1, 2018",16,"I am a type 2 diabetic for about 20 years now and last year my one knee really got sore and walking was tough. I used all kind of pain cremes on my knee but nothing worked. I got a cortisone shot and it worked for about a month, but it really elevates the blood sugars. Now I have been using  Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) on my feet for a few years to get rid of the nerve pain, because nothing else worked. So I shaved my knee and tried the DMSO and like the foot pain I find it gives me about 10 days of relief. My family Dr is not a fan of the cortisone shots, and says the DMSO is safer. I am now trying DMSO mixed with some Voltaren. I leave it on for an hour then wash the knee and apply Aloe Vera to reduce the itching from the Voltaren. The 50 50 mixture itches more than the DMSO.
