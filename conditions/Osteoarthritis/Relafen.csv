0,Relafen,Osteoarthritis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 10, 2021",0,Doctor gave me samples to see if this drug would relieve some of my knee pain caused by osteoarthritis. I took 1-2 1000mg tablets a day for a week. No relief whatsoever. Iâ€™m happy for the  people who did get relief but for me this drug did nothing.,MakoMike
1,Relafen,Osteoarthritis,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 26, 2021",3,"I was in a car accident back in 2019 where I received a compression fracture of the spine, lower lumbar area. Along with 1 herniated disc on the left lower side of the spine. Also an additional herniated disc on the right lower side of the spine, which was more of a serious herniation than the left one. After my car insurance coverage ran out for my chiropractic visits, I started to see a Pain management doctor who gave me samples of Relafen DS (1,000MG). It actually worked very well with the inflammation, stiffness, and swelling around my lower back. Highly recommend asking your doctor about taking this medication for your back pain.",jondrums22
2,Relafen,Osteoarthritis,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 18, 2020",15,"I'm allergic to nsaids but I've tried everything to get the pain & inflammation  of osteoarthritis under control, at least where I can tolerate it. I just got Rx for relafen 500mg today & took about 1/8 because I was afraid I would have allergic reaction.  I'm fine so far & I honestly haven't felt this good in years. I'm praying I won't have problems with relafen & I'll get back to the way I used to be!!",Bones
3,Relafen,Osteoarthritis,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 26, 2016",35,"I love relafen aka nabumetone. I have OA, chronic low back pain, and chronic pain syndrome. It works best of all prescription nsaids I have tried. And believe me, I have tried a lot. I've become allergic to some, some just plain don't work, or cease working over time. I have been taking nabumetone for over 3 yrs now, no need to increase dose, no side effects. I absolutely swear by it. It's very rare that I even need to take anything for break thru pain.",Anonymous
4,Relafen,Osteoarthritis,6,,"May 10, 2011",67,"What started out as a simple back strain/sprain at 19 yrs old has, over the years, evolved into an all encompassing condition leaving me with Multiple Sclerosis, handicapped and needing a walker for any mobility. Through the years I have been on NSAIDs which have proven time and again to be so helpful in relieving pain to where I was taking 3200 mg of ibuprofen/day. Finally given Relafen, which has saved my stomach from all the pain medicines and ibuprofen. Have never had a problem with Relafen (nabumetone) over the 7 yrs I've been on them, and they continue to be instrumental in relief from daily pains due to MS. A great product!",frankietg
5,Relafen,Osteoarthritis,7,,"August 23, 2008",122,"As a 36 year old male suffering from osteoarthritis,this drug has made a substantial difference in my quality of life. I was not sure how long I would be able to keep working, now that I am being treated with this drug, my quality of life has increased greatly. I am able to work without severe pain. A definite plus is I don't have to worry about a narcotic cloudiness to contain my pain. I can now play and walk outside with my children. I am afraid of the side effects, but so far so good. Recommend this to others who may benefit from its use.",Anonymous
6,Relafen,Osteoarthritis,8,,"April 4, 2008",109,"My arthritis was pretty much under control using naprosyn, but it started making my stomach bleed so I had to discontinue using it. I was in pain all the time and couldn't participate in my hobby of folk dancing and even had to use a cane increasingly. After about a year of this I began taking Relafen and it relieved my pain dramatically. It's still not as good as the naprosyn but it is a lot easier on my stomach.",Anonymous
7,Relafen,Osteoarthritis,10,,"March 14, 2008",155,"I have had chronic fatigue, facet joint syndrome, degeneration of parts of the spine as well as fibromyalgia and very severe osteoarthritis for over 10 years- I cannot take other OTC products because suprizingly they cause tummy upset. I have had no side effects, and  my MD watches me closely.I am glad to have this medication work for me.",Medsdowork
