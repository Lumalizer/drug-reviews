I would say about 80% and when I came off 3 days later started hurting again and a month later was practically bedridden from pain. Yes, it works well!!   I stopped taking it one time  because of my severe GERD which I had before mobic but became worse with Mobic but now that I am on a PPI medication I don't have to worry about the GERD anymore. I just upped the antacids as needed. It is much better than suffering from severe pain. I am sensitive to medication but there is no side effects outside maybe some very minor drowsiness the first few days starting back taking the medicine. It has helped me. I have degenerative disks, compression in my spinal cord,  suspected AS as well as arthritis in all my joints and they are testing me for autoimmune issues. You may not even realize how much it helps until you stop taking it. I knew it was helping me a lot but didn't realize how much.

15,Meloxicam,Osteoarthritis,,,"July 22, 2021",0,My mom went to the doctor for a little hip pain. He gave her a cortisone shot and prescribed Meloxicam. I was told cortisone and Meloxicam can cause a ruptured stomach and digestive tract. My mom took Meloxicam for 1 month - refilled the prescription and took another 14 pills over 14 days. Meloxicam caused sudden acute kidney failure in my mother and her blood pressure crashed causing the death of my mother.  This is an extremely dangerous drug. I've been told it shouldn't be prescribed to anyone over the age of 60 and a doctor should run blood work to make sure the patient doesn't have any underlying kidney issues. My mother's autopsy showed that my 79 year old mother was perfectly healthy - no disease in any organs. Her death certificate lists cause of death as acute kidney failure caused by Meloxicam.
