0,Etodolac,Osteoarthritis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 22, 2021",0,My pain management Dr. gave me this to help with my constant pain in my back and neck from surgery. It seemed to be helping with my other meds but I started itching on my hands and feet and having chest pain. I have taken it nearly a month but stopped today to see if my itching and chest pain stopped…. It has so I’ll be letting her know apparently I’m allergic to it,Little Bit
1,Etodolac,Osteoarthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 6, 2020",8,"I have a neck injury that occurred many years ago, now I have arthritis in my neck because of the injury.  I can no longer receive prednisone in my neck due to reaching max limit, and now have DDD, I also have developed osteoarthritis of my hands from many years of abuse, pumping blood pressure cuffs.  Went to orthopedic doctor 2 weeks ago for the pain ( I have not gone to dr for pain in bones in a year, and before that almost 30 years for my neck.  He prescribed etodolac ( lodine) 400 mg once daily.  Well I have a history of a heart attack and take 3 blood pressure medications.  Why would a doctor prescribe a medication (nsaid) to someone so high risk?  I don’t get it.   I told him I have tried Aleve (against my better judgement) and it caused stomach pain and severe headache.   Ibuprofen don’t work at all.  Well I guess I will have to live in severe pain when it flares up because I will NOT take the lodine.  What a waste of money and time.",Mysticld
2,Etodolac,Osteoarthritis,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 9, 2018",7,I have used Lodine and Lodine XL. It has worked so well that I have panicked at the fact I can no longer afford this generic. The price started going up exponentially about 5 yrs ago and now I can not afford with pharmacy discounts. Too bad the company is so greedy. If you can afford I highly recommend.,Ks-1
3,Etodolac,Osteoarthritis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 26, 2018",21,"14 years ago a surgeon recognized an arthritic flare up in my shoulder following a nasty fall. He prescribed Etodolac which quickly shut down the pain. I continued on the drug for a couple of years vs surgery. One day I forgot to take it and thought I had the flu I hurt so much in every joint. I discovered I had OA just about everywhere. The Etodolac is the only thing which keeps me functional. I live in fear of running out. I've never had a side effect I know of. If it works for you, it's miraculous.",Daisycam
4,Etodolac,Osteoarthritis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 20, 2018",22,I have been taking Etodolac for 6 years now twice a day as I could hardly walk due to knee pain.

5,Etodolac,Osteoarthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 21, 2018",8,"I was taking 200 mg of this script for chronic arthritis pain. I MUST wear orthotics on my feet EVEN when I’m just at home, I can not stand or walk unless I have orthotics on my feet at ALL times. I also suffer with arthritis in my lower lumbar spine where it was fused with a rod & screws.  I recently found out I now have two herniated discs above the metal in my back.  CHRONIC PAIN is NO way to live. HOW I WISH this would work for me!! Sadly, even though I experienced no side affects, this medication has not done anything for my pain at all.",Tino1962
6,Etodolac,Osteoarthritis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 9, 2017",14,I have OA in both knees. I have been  taking Aleve twice to three times a day with little to no relief. I work at night so I need to have some relief in order to walk. I started etodolac 200mg yesterday evening. The night was very bad with lots of knee pain and discomfort. I took 400mg this morning with breakfast and 6 hours later the pain is finally subsiding. I hate changing drugs because the new drugs always take a long time to take effect. This is beginning to work earlier than I expected and it is welcomed. I hope this works out well for me.,MENINBLK
7,Etodolac,Osteoarthritis,10.0,,"November 1, 2017",16,"I was taken off etodolac recently because labs indicated elevated  blood urea nitrogen test (BUN) & Creatinine.  I had been on etodolac for about 20 years with no side effects and manageable discomfort. I was walking 5 miles a day and lifting weights for 3 hours a week.  I felt great.  Over the counters did nothing for me except discovering an allergy to acetaminophen.  I'm taking 4 mg methylprednisolone a day and hurt all over; Age 72, female and really aggravated.",Jack 98
8,Etodolac,Osteoarthritis,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 23, 2017",14,"Had ligament & cartilage surgery on knee in early 80s. By 2000, pain made even sleeping tough. Was prescribed etodolac ER, 400 mg 2/day. Honestly, it gave me my life back. After 1 or 2 yrs, started using only 1 pill per day. Use 2/day only when cycling extra hard, snow-shoeing or skiing. None of these activities would be possible without this Rx! Only drawback is that my skin is a bit dryer and itchier in the cooler months.",TWC17

11,Etodolac,Osteoarthritis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 3, 2015",34,"I have severe Osteo Arthritis in most of my major joints: Spine, shoulders, hips, knees (until I just had bi-lateral knee replacements in August). I've had spinal fusion L3-S1 for OA complications and continued OA in the remainder of my spine. I've been taking Etodolac twice daily along with other pain meds for over 14 years.  I've never had any adverse problems with it. I do however take Zantac 75 or equivalent twice daily to help protect my stomach.I'm a firm believer in this medication. When I need to come of of it for a procedure, my OA flares up once again. With my daily medication regime I continue to work full time in a shipyard and as a Fire Chief on a volunteer fire department. Give it a try, it may just do wonders for you.",Jim from Maine

I have very little or no pain when I take the Lodine 2x a day. There are times I only take it once a day because if my stomach is off, it can bother it. Otherwise, it works better than anything else I've been on.",mdib

19,Etodolac,Osteoarthritis,7.0,,"February 3, 2011",33,"I've been using ibuprofen for years and lately it has not been as effective and bothering my stomach with use of Fosamax too. Doctor switched me to Etolodac 400mg TR twice a day and I am happy he did. The stomach is handling it better with me, and the pain has gone to little or none based on the day. This was a wonderful relief as he had tried me on Celebrex and another previously and the ibuprofen worked better then. Now with the ibuprofen being less effective I am glad to have found this one.",Anonymous
