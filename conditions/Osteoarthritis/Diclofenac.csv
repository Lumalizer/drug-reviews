8,Diclofenac,Osteoarthritis,6.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 23, 2021",3,I was prescribed diclofenac 75 mg to be taken twice a day. I was on diclofenac for probably five years and it made me feel a lot better in that my aches and pains were essentially nonexistent. However I am now aware that I have paid the price or taking this drug too long. This drug is an NSAID and it is known to compromise your kidney function. So now lucky me I have been diagnosed with stage 3 kidney disease. I feel partly to blame for this because I was aware that this drug should not be taken long term but I'm also a little upset with my doctor who kept prescribing it. Just be aware that this drug can do to you what it has done to me. I hope my kidneys can recover now that I have ceased using Diclofenac. Did the research that I have done thus far is unclear as to whether or not your kidneys can recover and if so by how much.,speedballjet
