0,Methylprednisolone,Osteoarthritis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2022",0,"I was prescribed a 6 day pack of prednisone for muscle pain 6 months after hip replacement.by the 3rd day most all of my arthritis pain ( which I have in most joints in my body) stopped!!This is the best I have felt as far as arthritis pain in 25 years.... after the 3rd day on prednisone 6 day pack the reduction in pain and stiffness was unbelievable.After the 6 day pack was completed it took 2 days for the arthritis pain to return. I really think I have some type of rheumatoid  arthritis but my GP doctor disagrees.After nearly 30 years of intense joint and muscle pain plus joint replacements in knees, hips, and feet plus intense hand wrist pain I do not think it is just osteoarthritis pain as diagnosed by my g p doctor.",happy
1,Methylprednisolone,Osteoarthritis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 25, 2020",14,I am 49 and  was diagnosed with Osteoarthritis in my left hip and have been in pain for the last 1 1/2 years trying several medications with no help. I can no longer walk without my cane have constant spasms and not being able to get up from sitting position for at least an hour with horrible pain.  I've also been given 3 cortisone injections  I was given the 4 mg dose pack of methylprednisolone and after my first dose I had 85% of my pain and stiffness gone!!!! I did experience some mood changes happy one min then crying the next and my face was flushed. It has been so long since I have felt this good and feeling very little pain that the two side effects I experienced were with it!!!!!!,Dana
2,Methylprednisolone,Osteoarthritis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 8, 2020",6,"Orthopaedic surgeon gave me two spinal injections for pain due to much deterioration, arthritis, etc. Wonderful relief !! He also gave me the 4mg  methylprednisolone medpak.I put off taking it for many days because my pain was gone & since I read the horrible reviewsI only took ""one""  pill, just 1, and I was jittery & pacing & had to pee every 20 minutes. .....UGHSo I thought well maybe after time your body gets used to it & it won't be as bad. Wrong idea big time !!!I couldn't sleep for two days,  couldn't concentrate or think straight. So needless to say I stopped taking it.",Jules
3,Methylprednisolone,Osteoarthritis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 9, 2020",9,Depo-Medrol (methylprednisolone):Years ago when I had bronchitis my family doc gave me injection of depo-medrol and it not only fixed my lungs it fixed the pains everywhere in my back and hip. Fast forward years later my family doc retired and I had a hard time to find someone to give the injection. Finally a pain clinic will give it but I need it more than every 3 months. Its intramuscular injection. I have severe osteoarthritis now and take calcium and magnesium supplements . I am in severe pain 30 days after the injection and am bed ridden until I can get the injection again. I get low dose opiates they do not touch the pain and doc wont up the mg dose and I am afraid to take Meloxicam and Diclofenac the RX NSAIDS.,misslottie
4,Methylprednisolone,Osteoarthritis,,,"September 30, 2019",6,"Still unsure  about methylprednisolone and waiting on more results. Doc subscribe for my knuckles swollen, possible gout. For many months of feeling like my joints being literally RIPPING apart at the joints - fingers, hip, knees, ankle and all the bones in both feet.  Within 36-48 hours after starting the med, taking it on a strict time schedule ! I started to feel like a human being again and by the 5th day I thought I was imagining that I could  actually live a normal life again.   I am scared the pain is going to come back, it has been four weeks.      I am not 100% but I would love to get back to a life that isn't solely based on pain.",Lizzard602
5,Methylprednisolone,Osteoarthritis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 21, 2019",21,"MethylPREDNISolone Dose Pack (methylprednisolone):Been on med for only 3 days and there is a noticeable decrease in the amount of pain and swelling I had prior to taking this med.  I could barely walk after having an arthritic flare up in my knee. By the second day of taking this med, the pain decreased greatly and I was able to walk. I still had some pain, but not nearly as bad as it was. I still have 3 days to go. I'm hoping for even better news!",Kelly

7,Methylprednisolone,Osteoarthritis,,,"February 2, 2018",12,Depo-Medrol (methylprednisolone):I ended up with arachnoiditis after a Epidural spinal injection(ESI).  This is NOT FDA approved for the back but your PM doc won’t tell you this.  It ruined my life!,K. James

10,Methylprednisolone,Osteoarthritis,7.0,,"April 22, 2017",14,"I was prescribed the 15mg dose pack for 6 days that tapers off. After the first day of taking 6 doses, I noticed a little relief. I'm on the third day now which is 4 doses, and I'm noticing even more relief from the pain. On the 4 th day I will take 3 doses, on the 5th day, I will take 2 doses, and then on the 6th day I will take one dose and I will be done. I am also taking meloxicam so I am not sure if that's helping as well. I am concerned about weight gain, but so far I have not experienced any side effects. The doses are easy to take and I'm hoping by the time I finish, the inflammation is gone and I'm feeling normal again.  When all else fails, I would recommend this 15mg 6pak to anyone that has inflammation with unbearable pain.",RFBB
11,Methylprednisolone,Osteoarthritis,10.0,,"July 17, 2013",45,Depo-Medrol (methylprednisolone):I get an injection (40) in my hip and knee every three months.  Has been a great relief for over 5 years.  I am almost 68 years old.  Have told other seniors of this great injection to avoid or delay knee and hip replacement and pain relief.,Jolly Green Giant
12,Methylprednisolone,Osteoarthritis,10.0,,"January 22, 2013",43,"Depo-Medrol (methylprednisolone):Had injections in both knees today. Aching a little but severe pain easing. I have been advised by specialist as long as shots work to avoid having knee replacements, as that is a long time to recoup. I hate reading all the side effects of Depo Medrol, too. The dosage is very minimal I've been told. Today's injection was my first since July!",1111sallyg
13,Methylprednisolone,Osteoarthritis,9.0,,"September 4, 2009",34,The medication was a wonder drug and I was able to move with great mobility. I was able to walk without help and bend but the one thing it did do was raise my blood pressure. I got off of it and now I have to monitor my blood pressure to see that it does not go dangerously high.  I wish they could make a medication similar to this without that side effect because having the pain in something awful.,Anonymous
14,Methylprednisolone,Osteoarthritis,10.0,,"August 15, 2009",79,"Medrol Dosepak (methylprednisolone):Truly a quality of life improver. I can't thank my doctor enough for giving me this prescription when I have debilitating flare ups.  Just have to rest and not over exert your joints when on this medicine.  Let the swelling subside before returning to normal activities.  For me, 2-3 days, and I feel great.",pen123
