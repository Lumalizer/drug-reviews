0,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 19, 2021",5,"My dr prescribed this for chronic pain and joint damage, dx juvenile onset stills disease 30+ years earlier. The first night I took 1 tablet. Next morning I woke to 2 voices talking in the background and then suddenly a voice like an old lady right next to my ear said HELLO? I jumped and was scared out of bed. It was weird. Then my eyes went really blurry. This is apparently a normal side effect?!  I felt very numb and basically stopped being able to function. I couldn’t tell you if I still felt pain or not. I couldn’t do anything but stare at the wall and cry. Our family went to another family’s house for dinner and I was so confused socially I didn’t know what was happening. I hid in the bathroom crying. I persisted with this medication for 3 months so I could tell the doctor I tried. I was very happy before I took it and I’d rather be in horrible pain and happy than dysfunctional like that. That was barely even existence.",missnomer
1,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 30, 2020",34,"I’ve been on this med for 3 long years for major depressive disorder and severe osteoarthritis. Not by choice mind you, but because the withdrawals effects were so severe for me I couldn’t get off it even with tapering. It gives me massive brain zaps, increased insomnia and racing thoughts, nausea, the worse dizziness I ever experienced that I just can’t take anymore after 2 days non stop. I don’t recommend this medication because how differently it affects people. You could be a statistic like me and suffer hard form this medicine. As for the pain relief, I didn’t feel much of it I have severe osteoarthritis in many joints so I i don’t really feel much relief from many medications.",Dingus
2,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 20, 2020",19,"Was prescribed Cymbalta for debilitating pain when initially diagnosed with severe RA  and OA.  Never worked again. I did however sleep away the greater part of a year. Completely sapped my energy and only identified Cymbalta as the cause when many years later was prescribed again and a more coherent me realized this drug literally knocked me out cold. My husband asked how the med was working and I lifted my head off the couch and said great. He responded you have been laying in the same spot for three days. Apparently, this drug is not for me. That being said it allowed me the best sleep I ever had both times I took it. Lol",LisDai
3,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 28, 2020",69,"CYMBALTA changed my life.I started using Cymbalta for severe chronic lower back pain. My pain was so bad I considered suicide on many occasions. After failed back surgery, over the counter medications, epidurals, spinal ablation and everything else imaginable, my pain doctor prescribed Cymbalta. The side effects from Cymbalta were horrible, but within 2 weeks my back pain completely disappeared. I still deal with the side effects and Cymbalta is a highly addictive drug that is near impossible to withdraw from. I have come to terms with the alternatives and have decided Cymbalta is worth all of the negatives. It has saved my life.",WSR
4,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 14, 2020",26,"I was put on 60 mg of Cymbalta during an acute arthritis flare up, and after about a year I wanted to taper off of it. It killed my libido. and it didn’t significantly help with pain. Then the real nightmare began! Trying to go down in the tiniest increments brought on intense mood swings, crying for no reason, and horrible brain zaps that made life unmanageable. This stuff is TOXIC!!!!!!!",Anonymous
5,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 23, 2019",54,Do not take Cymbalta!  The side effects are horrible and the withdrawal symptoms from getting off of it can land you in the hospital. I took it for arthritis and would rather hurt then go through this garbage again. If I had known what damage this drug does I would never have taken it.,Anonymous

7,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 18, 2019",37,"This drug over time took away all emotional feelings. I could witness a accident and instead of being concerned I wasn't even phased. I found myself being cold and blunt with people. I was also suffering from crazy head and body sweats. Random but always severe. My Blood Pressure went through the roof. I lost ALL sexual desire to be with my wife or any woman. I'm blessed my wife stuck by me. Fatigue was also severe. I could sleep 12 hours and wake up feeling like I worked a 12hr midnight shift. After two years and age 43 I am starting to come off of it. My dose of 60mg has been reduced to 30mg and the sweating is gone, BP stabilized and energy returning. The main reason I suffered through the drug so long because it did help my Osteo. Right now is sooner suffer with pain and tend to my wife's physical needs like I once loved doing.",Polarprince
8,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2019",23,"I was given Cymbalta 60mg for arthritis pain primarily and insomnia secondary. It had been recommended by both my oncologist and PCP. I felt awful the 5 days I took it. While there was a slight reduction in pain from a 4 to 3, I couldn’t eat. I woke up from restless sleep vomiting; I could have aspirated. I stopped immediately and had no side effects from doing so. The nausea was unbearable, and my anti-nausea meds were counter-indicated. Horrible experience. I gave a 2 rather than 1 due to slight pain reduction. I saw no improvement in sleep.",Astyanax
9,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 10, 2018",36,"I have never found an antidepressant that helps so well with arthritic pain management and generalized anxiety disorder.  Very few side effects compared to other SNRIs , etc effexor.    It has been a blessing for me so far. Have only been on it 2 weeks. Only side effect is a very slight nausea for about 15 minutes.",Anonymous
10,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,10.0,,"October 3, 2017",48,"I have arthritis, neuropathy, fibromyalgia and depression. I have been taking Humira for my arthritis which caused heart failure.  I had stopped taking the Cymbalta for a while because I was trying to cut back on medication. And I couldn't figure out why my arthritis felt so horrible as soon as I started to take the Cymbalta again my arthritis is so much better. It actually works better than the Humira did and better than the Lyrica that I am taking for my neuropathy. So I actually discovered how well it works accidentally. But it's so nice to be able to walk around again with so much less pain.",Tasha1418
11,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,10.0,,"July 19, 2017",50,I've been in constant pain from osteoarthritis with some fibromyalgia on top of it for about two years and began taking cymbalta about 6+ weeks ago.  I've been pain free for a month now with no need for any painkillers (I was taking a vicoden and tramadol  every day during that time).  Truly a miraculous recovery.  Interestingly my doctor told me that his wife who had bad osteoarthritis pain had the same result from the cymbalta.  Hope that it continues!,Daisypop
12,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 2, 2017",23,"I started taking this med six days ago to treat neuropathy pain in my feet and lower legs. It, like gabapentin that I was taking before this, is giving me severe arthritis pain in my hands and knees, which I did not have before. I will discontinue the use today. It stopped the neuropathic pain but is crippling me in other ways. I will go back to treatments with NSAIDS and acetaminophen.",Justajo
13,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,9.0,,"November 30, 2016",60,"I experienced chronic pain for 4 years, I had difficulty sleeping, would go to work, come home and go to bed. Every time I physically exerted myself, taking a shower, preparing a meal, doing household chores, I would need to go lay down. My family would visit me in my bedroom, it was depressing. Cymbalta has changed my life. I can tolerate the cold, even the grocery store used to bother me. I am much more active and find myself only going to bed when it is time for sleep, I also sleep much better. My family has noticed  a huge change in me, as far as being a part of life again.This is not without cost..I have the strangest dreams, +30lbs, tired, terribly constipated.",life sucked

15,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 11, 2016",49,"Tried Cymbalta for pain and slight depression.  It helped for maybe 10 months.  Then began experiencing panic attacks, anxiety, mouth sores, racing heart at bedtime, insomnia, and increased pain and cramps in legs.  Took me about 3 months to figure out that the Cymbalta wasn't working.  I tried increasing from 30 mg to 60 mg and that made it worse.  Have changed meds.  Made the change easily in one week, but I had already gone back to the 30 mg dose.  The anxiety, panic attacks, etc. have stopped.",JFME
16,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 6, 2016",69,Cymbalta has been a heaven sent. I have severe osteoarthritis in both knees and I'm 35. I stayed in chronic pain. On a 1-10 scale I was 76. This medication took my pain level to a 2. I couldn't believe how effective it was after 1 dose. I do suffer side effects such as nausea and diarrhea but I'm praying it passes. I've only been on the meds 3 days. I don't feel sidelined in life anymore. I can participate nearly pain free.,Sunset Mami
17,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,10.0,,"March 5, 2015",95,"I suffer with arthritis in hands, knees, elbows, and hips.  In 2013 I underwent a total left hip replacement and worked hard in rehab to become active again.  However, as time progresses, my joints continue to 'talk' to me loudly.  In the mornings, I look like a crone hobbling around until from moving they begin to become fluid.  Ridiculous!  My doctor put me on Cymbalta back in December of 2014.  Wow.  What a difference.  I did have some struggles on learning when to take it without suffering with nausea, dizziness, etc.  For me, morning time seems to be the ticket.  Mid day or evening caused stomach and head issues. I am on a  lower dose compared to what I have read, but I give this a A+.  Within 15 minutes of taking my dose, I am fine.",Hipppie chic

I can get out of bed in the morning without hobbling around trying to get my joints working.I can also get up from my chair at work without pain.I am amazed at how much better I feel.

20,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,3.0,,"August 6, 2014",92,I was prescribed Cymbalta for arthritic pain in my knees. I took 30 mg/day for 3 days and was fatigued to the point of not wanting to do anything but lie down.In addition (to which I found out was a rare side effect) I was yawning all day and evening. After reading about the difficulties that some people had getting off this medicine. I stopped it after the 3 days. Unless I can be somewhat assured that the side effects are temporary I would rather live with the pain then take this medicine.,pjs001
21,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 5, 2014",56,"This was great for pain relief for the two months I was taking it. The problems I had far out weighted any benefits. I was suffering from blackouts where I would do things and not remember doing them. The depression, nausea, and headaches were unbearable too. I have been off it for 2 months now and am just starting to feel better. I'll live with the on-average 8 pain.",Sierra M.
22,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 21, 2013",116,I was put on Cymbalta approximately 4 yrs ago for depression due to my spouses terminal illness.  I was experiencing lower back pain at the same time and subsequently had surgery 2 yrs ago.  During this time I tried to go off the medicine but discovered that I do have severe pain from osteoarthritis.  Went back on Cymbalta and have almost complete relief from it.  I take 60 mgs. at around 1:00 pm. Morning dosage brought diarrhea quickly and this does not cause that.,elaineabc
23,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,8.0,,"March 19, 2013",76,After a back injury and subsequent surgery I tried several medicines for the lingering nerve pain in my left leg.  Nothing worked without severe side effects until trying Cymbalta.  The first couple of weeks the nausea was almost unbearable but I toughed it out hoping for some relief of the aching in my left leg.  Pain pills had zero effect on the radiating pain so my doctor prescribed Cymbalta.  It did take a couple of weeks to see any relief to my pain.  Although the pain is not totally gone it has gone from a 10  down to a 7 so for me this is a great improvement.,Cricket's mom

27,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,5.0,,"March 19, 2012",65,"Was taking Cymbalta for depression when my hip arthritis flared up.  I had seen the ads about Cymbalta for use in arthritis, but wasn't really taking it for that reason, so I didn't think too much about it. I switched to another depression medicine, after a period of weaning because of the high cost and side effects of Cymbalta.  Within 2 weeks my arthritis pain had become intense, almost unbearable.  Guess they are right in saying it helps with the pain.  It didn't totally remove the pain, but it did keep it under control.  Now I am struggling to find something else to help with the pain.",happychef
28,Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,9.0,,"January 20, 2012",114,"I suddenly developed osteoarthritis of the knee with crippling pain. I was overwhelmed with the pain and the challenges of my mobility. My doctor prescribed Cymbalta for the depression I'd developed as a result of ambulatory challenges and within two days, I noticed that my knee pain had subsided.  After a few more days, I realized that the connection with the end of my pain and Cymbalta was obvious.  I called my doctor and learned that she was very much aware that she would kill two birds with one stone if she prescribed Cymbalta.

I am also arthritic and cannot believe how the pain in my joints has improved since I started taking Cymbalta.  I had gotten to the point where I had to go to bed by 7 or 8 pm - not because I was sleepy, but because I was in too much pain to move.  Now I am easily able to do a few more hours of chores before calling it a day.  I am not sure how well it is working as an anti-depressant, but the simple feeling of accomplishment of being an adult able to stay on my feet until ""bedtime"" is enough to call it a success in my book.",Anonymous
