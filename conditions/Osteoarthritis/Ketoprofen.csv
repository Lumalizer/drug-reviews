2,Ketoprofen,Osteoarthritis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 31, 2016",10,"I am 53. I am very active with sports.  Sadly for the last two years I have terrible pain and I have extreme difficulty walking,  climbing stairs or even sitting down on the loo or as it is called in America-  trying to sit on the toilet seat. Two days ago I went to see a Doctor here in Italy and she prescribed this drug- 200 mg once a day.  I took it yesterday for the first time and woke up the next day feeling like my old self-  ready to rule the world!

4,Ketoprofen,Osteoarthritis,10,,"December 7, 2008",14,"Ketoprofen 75 mg is the only medicine I could find that would stop the swelling and pain in my hands, elbows and back.

At 62 I recommend you try it. I think you might like it, I have no side effects from it.",JB from KY
