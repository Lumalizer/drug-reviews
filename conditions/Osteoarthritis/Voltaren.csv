0,Voltaren,Osteoarthritis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2022",0,"I was prescribed Voltaren 75 mg tablets 2X daily for knee and foot arthritis pain after initially using the gel and Aleve with no improvement. The first week, it worked like a miracle and I walked 30 minutes daily on treadmill with NO pain at all. Life was good again! The second week, it had no effect on my pain. The pain is back. I am so discouraged. I am trying it for another two weeks. I wish I knew why it worked so well to begin with and now doesn't.",LT57
1,Voltaren,Osteoarthritis,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 11, 2021",0,"Voltaren DOES NOT, I repeat DOES NOT WORK on my Arthritis pain located at the joint of both thumbs. Very painful and limits hand function due to the pain. I have tried for a few years just to see if it would develop into a helpful remedy, JUST A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. Does not relieve any pain in thumb joints at all. This product is garbage.",James B
2,Voltaren,Osteoarthritis,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 16, 2021",0,DO NOT USE THIS GEL AND EXPOSE IT TO THE SUN FOR EXTENDED PERIOD. I have used this for several years for hands and knee as needed.I recently used it on both hands and went golfing (Florida) For about four to five hours. That evening I had serious itching on  the back side of both hands.  Then my ungloved hand swelled up and was very uncomfortable.  I tried Ice then Cortisone cream but it was no help.Next day I took prednisone and in two days the symptoms went away.I mentioned this to another golfer who told me he had same experience on his knee that resulted in skin coming off!,Sam

6,Voltaren,Osteoarthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 25, 2020",17,I tried Voltaren because it was new and different and nothing else on the market helped with my knee pain. I followed the directions and found that it doesn't work either. Definitely not worth the price I paid. I'm hoping that some day I will be able to find a product that actually does what it claims.,Big C

My doctor prescribed Voltaren because I built up a resistance to ibuprofen and Aleve. I've been in pain for so long I forgot what it was like to be pain free.

17,Voltaren,Osteoarthritis,9.0,,"November 2, 2013",43,1 pill twice a day. Voltaren effective until it caused server swelling of my entire legs and hands. The increased edema put pressure on my bursa in both hips and on the nerves leaving my groin and going into my legs. All of this pressure caused electrical shocks in my thighs.

If I get up walk around for a few minutes sometimes the pain vanishes. Otherwise  I apply Voltaren gel- about the size of a small grape over the sore place and the pain goes away pretty quickly. I occasionally apply Voltaren ahead of time if I know I'm going to be on my feet a lot. ",michael266

I also have bursitis & piriformis syndrome in my right hip as well as achilles tendonitis in the right foot. I take 75mg 2 times a day.

I have been taking the medication for 3 days and this is the best that I have felt in six months.  I will defintely follow his instructions and continue for 4 weeks in hopes of feeling even better.

I have tried the Synvisc injections %u2013 no help. It was getting to the point where I was sitting most of the day to avoid the pain and stiffness. Even swimming was painful.

What an advantage to be able to apply the gel right to the affected area, relief comes rather fast.It doesn't last as long as I would like, but when you are in pain, any relief is welcome.

Still have swelling in joints but the morning stiffness and pain is gone.  Gave it an 8 rating since I have only been on the drug for 1 week.

If your doctor has you on Celebrex and you don't feel any relief, ask him for Voltaren. You will most certainly feel the difference. If you are on it for any length of time (like me) then every so often you'll have to have blood work done to check your kidneys and liver to make sure they are functioning right as this medicine can cause problems with that.
