I am miserable, pain, swelling, redness up my arm and burning itch and blisters.  Some type of allergic reaction which apparently is not common…however I got this reaction.  I’m scared since my symptoms are similar to a skin infection (cellulitis), so just started antibiotics and an anti inflammatory.

Kenalog is the best steroid that I have tried; I get it in injection form - the injection does not affect your blood pressure so It is safe in my case since I have Hypertension. It is a shame that I can only receive the shots 2x/yr. If there were an option to have them once a month without a chance of joint destruction I would opt to get them without a second thought!,Muffin Top

I broke out in a dripping sweat, hyperventilate, vomited a lot and had diarrhea all over myself. They said they didn't think it was an allergic reaction but suggested that I might want to go to ER and get checked out. I did not want to go the the ER due to the COVID numbers being up and I would  sit there for hours. It's been several hours now and I still feel dizzy and queasy. I will call 911 if I have to.

17,Triamcinolone,Osteoarthritis,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 6, 2021",5,"Zilretta (triamcinolone):I had Zilretta injections several times in my left knee which was bone to bone from degenerative arthritis at age 73 and I am a big man of 200 pounds.  First injection gave partial relief for about 9-10 weeks maximum and each consecutive dose less effective down to about 4 weeks of relief with last dose.  A big problem is they would only give another injection after 90 days so waiting for the next dose meant a lot of pain between doses.  I quickly realized it is pain management only and the degenerative condition gets worse as you do more activity on the knee with reduced pain.  So surgery is inevitable.  You might as well go ahead with TKR.  Also, it is a steriod.  Several of my injections were painful at injection time and fact was for me, the surgeon delayed my surgery by 120 days saying Zilretta, as a steriod, gave increased risk of infection if given close to surgery date.  I would not do it again.  I would opt for TKR as soon as pain of bone to bone appears.  They do not tell all up front.",TOPCAT LTKR

Second shot I had severe pain and a burning sensation on the side of my knee that faces the other knee. This pain lasted 4 days and about drove me out of my mind. I kept thinking he injected into a nerve or something that shouldn't have been stabbed. It was horribly painful & I'm really good at handling pain but I was ready to have this leg amputated on day 3. Finally on day 5 it let up. Injection spot stayed red and swollen for two weeks. Now the shot is helping. I'm scheduled to get a third injection in December. If it reacts like the second one I'll know I'm allergic. However seems weird I had no reaction to the first shot then 7 months later the second shot nearly drove me insane. Made my whole body hurt. Especially my back. Never could get my doctor's office back on the phone. Now 3 weeks later and calling twice a week and leaving messages they don't return phone calls.,Pat

I was a little worried about it containing steroids, because I've previously had them worsen my mental health symptoms, but I didn't have too many problems with that this time. Of course, after the injection, my knee was sore & swollen, making it difficult to walk right for a few days. I noticed nasal congestion, which is one of the side effects. Since it's extended release, I expected the osteoarthritis pain & swelling in my knee to go down, at least a little bit over time. To date, it hasn't & has actually gotten worse. I've also noticed increased knee stiffness & leg spasms (feels like they're behind the knee cap), that I didn't have before. I was looking forward to this med providing much needed relief, not causing issues. At this point, I'm not planning to get my left knee done. Just not the results I expected. Although I don't believe it's at all related, I will be fair & mention I also have fibromyalgia.",Jillyn31

I am scheduled for knee replacement but there is 1 year wait for surgery.  Before injection I could not sleep due to throbbing pain and after injection this is gone.

I was given 2 injections into my left hip of Kenalog 40.  Later the first evening,  my face was hot and turned scarlet red.  The red swelling went into my right eye and felt like sand.  Then I started getting dizzy.  My blood pressure was off the charts and my blood sugar Doubled!  I had to lay down and all I did was sweat.  I thought I was having a heart attack!!  The next day,  the facial rash was better,  but the dizziness turned into violent shaking!  When sitting very still,  it felt like my whole body was on top of a paint shaker.  I got horrible diarrhea that lasted for days.  My OLP flared into a bloody mess.  It took 12 to 15 weeks to even feel kind of normal again",Styxgirl83
