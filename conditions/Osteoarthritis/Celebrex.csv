4,Celebrex,Osteoarthritis,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 13, 2020",77,"Celebrex has been a godsend for me.I'm allergic to aspirin, ibuprofen, aleve, etc.Celebrex is actually a sulfa-derived drug so I'm not allergic to it.  I have osteoarthritis in both knees, a blown lumbar disc, torn rotator cuff, bone spurs in my cervical spine from a car accident and chronic pain in my left wrist from breaking it in a biking accident as a child.  I'm 58 and still active, without Celebrex it would be hard to do anything many days.  I often take 200 mg per day for a week until my inflammation clears up and then try to stay off it for a month or so until I take it again, but it's dependent on my pain.  Always try to give my body a break from any drug.  Only side effect I have is some loose stools after taking it for several days in a row...not serious, but noticeable.",Wisguy

6,Celebrex,Osteoarthritis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 23, 2020",36,I have been taking Celebrex for osteo for about 25 years. I was taking up to 400mg a day for the last 15 years. If I wasn’t I would not have been able to work. The only side effects I have noticed are heartburn and a rash that may be from Celebrex. I have had two total knee replacements and an operation on an elbow for osteo. I have osteo in the lower back that they will not operate on as there is nothing they say they can do that will get rid off the pain. The doctor I’m seeing now has cut me back to 1x100mg a day and says he is taking me off it altogether. I don’t even feel like getting out of bed because of the pain. I’ll be changing doctors. It also helps a lot with pain from toothache infections.,Jeff

I will continue monitoring my blood pressure and am also hopeful that Celebrex is also acting as a ""joint preserving"" drug as well as a pain reliever.

It wasn't perfect. I still limped and had some pain and stiffness issues but it made a world of difference.  I am now off of it, and have taken a big hit in my flexibility and mobility. ",SuzyG

I need both knees replaced for osteoarthritis, and I also have pain in my back, neck, elbows, hips and wrists.  I've been on Celebrex for 6 or 7 years.  When I first used it, it used to make me very dizzy.  But it NEVER ever relieved any pain for me!I always had to pop multiple Tylenol, Motrin or Advil to supplement, in order to get even minimum relief.My doctor put me on Arthrotec today, and I am really hoping for success.  If that doesn't work, he's going to try me on Tylenol-3 (codeine-based).",Callianne
