0,Kenalog-40,Osteoarthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2022",0,"I had an injection of Kenalog 3 days ago in my left thumb joint at base of thumb.  I am miserable, pain, swelling, redness up my arm and burning itch and blisters.  Some type of allergic reaction which apparently is not common…however I got this reaction.  I’m scared since my symptoms are similar to a skin infection (cellulitis), so just started antibiotics and an anti inflammatory.  Terrible drug..I was so happy to relieve my arthritis pain and this has happened.  How long until this drug is out of my system?",Tcibs
1,Kenalog-40,Osteoarthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2021",5,"I should have read the reviews before getting an injection of Kenalog in my knee. Almost immediately I started feeling dizzy and I was the day and night went on my heart started racing I haven’t slept in one minute. I have extreme anxiety and my blood pressure shot up to 159/95 and pulse 95 and that is even on my blood pressure medicine. I had the worst heartburn and just feel dread. I am hoping these side effects subside over the next few days but the reviews say not. Also, it has made my asthma a lot worse over the last 24 hours. This is the second injection I have gotten and I said I would never do it again but this time I mean it. It never did help my pain what a waste.",WORST EVER
2,Kenalog-40,Osteoarthritis,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 18, 2021",0,I have Cerebral Palsy which includes the secondary condition of Osteoarthritis. Kenalog is the best steroid that I have tried; I get it in injection form - the injection does not affect your blood pressure so It is safe in my case since I have Hypertension. It is a shame that I can only receive the shots 2x/yr. If there were an option to have them once a month without a chance of joint destruction I would opt to get them without a second thought!,Muffin Top
3,Kenalog-40,Osteoarthritis,2.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 10, 2021",3,"Works great for my arthritis pain BUT the side effects are not worth it.  I've been getting injections for years for arthritis in various body parts.  EVERY time I get the injection I don't have a period for 3 months and then BAM, I get hit with a period that is extremely heavy and lasts for 3 weeks.  Also, I was not informed that this injection could make the skin at the injection site very thin after getting multiple shots.  I covered a scratch in one such spot with a bandaid, when I removed it all of the skin under the bandaid came off with it.  Huge scar, very painful, skin is still somewhat thin in that spot even years after stopping the injection.",Anonymous

8,Kenalog-40,Osteoarthritis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2019",11,"I am 74 years young, active person. Had pain in my jaw for about three weeks, could hardly talk or eat.  Thinking it was something awful, I went to the E.R. and the MD there ordered a CAT Scan of the mandible, etc.  Finally, the report came in as Osteo-Arthritis of the jaw area and inflammation, etc.  Well, I was given 2 injections: one of Toradol for pain and Kenalog for the inflammation.  Amazingly, after about one hour, I felt much better. Hardly any pain.The doctor told me to see my own MD for follow up and to take Aleve for pain until then.  I will be making an appt. ASAP since I was good for three whole weeks but now the pain is starting again.  I don't want to take Aleve too much as it irritates the stomach and could be harmful if taken consistently. No side effects from either drug.",Lovey
9,Kenalog-40,Osteoarthritis,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 9, 2018",26,"Do not get this injection!!!!  I got mine about 6 1/2 weeks ago.

Extreme nausea, no appetite, I’ve lost 8 lbs and I can not afford to lose weight.  I’m terrified how long this will go on.",Scared

13,Kenalog-40,Osteoarthritis,2.0,,"September 2, 2015",18,"No one warned me that there were ANY side effects to worry about.  I was given 2 injections into my left hip of Kenalog 40.  Later the first evening,  my face was hot and turned scarlet red.  The red swelling went into my right eye and felt like sand.  Then I started getting dizzy.  My blood pressure was off the charts and my blood sugar Doubled!  I had to lay down and all I did was sweat.  I thought I was having a heart attack!!  The next day,  the facial rash was better,  but the dizziness turned into violent shaking!  When sitting very still,  it felt like my whole body was on top of a paint shaker.  I got horrible diarrhea that lasted for days.  My OLP flared into a bloody mess.  It took 12 to 15 weeks to even feel kind of normal again",Styxgirl83
