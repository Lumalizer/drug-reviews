1,Tylenol with Codeine #3,Osteoarthritis,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 15, 2020",11,"I have had two hip replacements, one being 13 years ago, the other 7. Excruciating pain occurs in my SI every now and then, of course when one over does it. T3's are the most reliable relief, two extra strength tylenols don't even touch the discomfort and pain intensity. Whereas, with one T3, I can actually perform daily tasks.  I do not usually use it for more than two days in a row.. and usually many months apart. I have positive results and they work so well.",Glowma

4,Tylenol with Codeine #3,Osteoarthritis,8.0,,"July 15, 2013",79,"I take 4 or 5 Tylenol # 3's per day. Seems to work for my neck and shoulder at about a factor of 80%. Also helps a bit with being bummed out and also with minor depression. Hope this helps. P.S. I like this better than Vicodin. Vicodin gives me a headache, for some reason. ",dirk-davy

Side effects can be dizziness so do not operate a vehicle, etc. another side effect can be constipation if taken for more than several days.
