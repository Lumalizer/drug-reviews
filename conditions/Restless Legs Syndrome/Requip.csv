1,Requip,Restless Legs Syndrome,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 18, 2021",2,"I have been taking 2.5 mg Requip for about 4 years for RLS. Over the years, I have found that I need to take the medication at least 4 hours prior to bedtime in order to receive relief for sleeping. I have an alarm set on my phone to remind me daily. If I don't take the medication, I am out of bed several times a night, stretching my calves at bedside.",ffrn99
2,Requip,Restless Legs Syndrome,1.0,,"February 14, 2021",9,"My wife has been taking this medicine for 3 years. She has been a life long devout church going Christian. She developed an uncontrolled secret online gambling addiction that has likely caused us to lose our home just when we were fixing to pay it off. Destroyed our good  credit rating, repossessions, etc. When I finally found out we had occurred $1800 in overdraft fees in only 4 weeks. She gambled my entire paycheck week after and fell behind on the mortgage for MANY months with huge late fees attached and developed an awesome way to hide the addiction for a long time which made the financial destruction larger than imaginable. She kept gambling anyway in hopes of eventually winning enough to fix the disaster this medicine created hoping to fix it and I would never know. Doctors and Pharmacists need to  make it a priority to council the patient about Requip and plainly asked FREQUENTLY  if the patient has found themselves gambling to help stop it before it destroys families.",Mfin

4,Requip,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 5, 2020",30,"I have been taking Requip for probably 15 years for RLS, then I was moved up to requip XL and I've been taking that just fine for probably another 8 years.And if you have restless leg syndrome do you know what I'm talking about there's no such thing as sleep you just can't. I would rather go without my heart medication and have a heart attack than get no sleep and have a heart attack. Because my requip works I have to have the brand name. The ropinirole makes me very sick sick to my stomach I threw all my pills up and that doesn't do any good. It also makes me sick to my stomach and nauseous all day I don't want that either. So for the last four months I have been trying to refill my requip and nobody seems to have it.  Did they stop making the real thing? Please tell me they did not stop making requip and all they have is ropinirole. It would be the end of me I cannot find the real thing. I need the real thing!",Dee

6,Requip,Restless Legs Syndrome,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 16, 2020",95,I have had RLS for over 40 years. I have taken every single drug available. I took requip when it was first being used for RLS. It worked a charm. With some crazy side effects. I had to stop it after 6 months because it started to give me rebound RLS. Now if I take a Requip I will have horrible RLS. I started taking opiates for it. From my neuro who told me I had the worst case he had seen.  I have it all over. I have been suicidal. I have been miserable almost all my life. It isn’t fair to force someone with a terrible medical condition to live. Well now I take Methadone. 140 mg everyday. I no longer have ANY RLS symptoms. Yes it made me gain weight but I don’t care. I live without any RLS symptoms and that is all I care about. I would never give up this medication. If I am ever forced off that will be the end of the road for me. I can’t go back to not sleeping for weeks at a time. I used to be lucky if I feel asleep for an hour a day.,Shabbycat

That night traumatized me for a long time. Side effects , electric-like shooting pains exiting from my vertebrae bilaterally. When I returned home I looked up this medication. The approval rating was high, but if you read the side effects people had I would not recommend it to anyone. Leg pain with gabapentin. Mirapex made my muscles cramp up. My mom loved it, but I am back to clonazepam. Quality control bad with generics but as anyone who suffers from RLS knows, you get quite desperate, almost frantic if you run out of medication. BTW antidepressants exasperate symptoms.",Izzl

18,Requip,Restless Legs Syndrome,1.0,,"October 17, 2017",78,"Don’t take this for RLS.  It causes augmentation.  Symptoms get better in the beginning, then eventually you need more Requip to make RLS go away.  Eventually, the meds stop working altogether and RLS is out of control, worse than before you stated meds.  You try to come off the meds and RLS gets even worse.This is very common and occurs in 70-80% of everyone on Requip.Your doctor will likely not understand and/or think you’re crazy.Find another doctor.The solution is to get off the dopamine drugs like Requip.  Get on a different class of meds, like Gabapentin, Horizant, or Lyrica.  Checkout RLS.org for help.",Keke66747434

The RLS was so severe I literally asked my husband to hide the guns in the house because I was that miserable (along w other side effects from the cancer treatment).  I was referred to a sleep neuro and was started on 2 mg of Requip.   This drug I believe has changed and saved my life. Literally.  I went without a dose for the first time last night because I didn't make it to the pharmacy in time for my refill.  Well I had zero sleep last night.

I had taken 2 doses, and had one episode of RLS the second day.  On the 3rd day, I was sitting in the waiting room at the colonoscopy clinic while my husband was in the back.  I kept dozing off, and would wake up, looking for my bottle of water, and it was in my purse,  sitting in my lap.  This happened over 4-5 times.   Anyhow, I took another dose that night, which was a Monday.  The next day, on the drive home, I was dozing, then woke up, raised up my seat, put my window down a little, reached out and pushed the mirror up!  I didn't say anything, put my window back up, and went back to sleep.  That was my last dose and I threw the rest of it away.",Texas Mimi

Have recently been to the doctors and got 500mcg and when it's really bad I'm going to try it and see if it helps for during the day.On my last holiday I took one mg about 3 o'clock and it helped but that only left one mg for the evening and this meant it didn't last till morning but to be honest I think I need to up my dose but am scared that my RLS is only going to get worse so don't want up my dose by too much.",EPH
27,Requip,Restless Legs Syndrome,8.0,,"October 24, 2016",45,"It works but it's based on what is in your stomach. If I'm stuffed and ate to much before bed, which can be hours before bed I need 3 mg. Some what full 2mg and if I ate small meals and I take it 2 hours before bed 1mg. Now if I take 1 or 2 mg on an empty stomach I might feel sick. I have gotten home before after work and very hungry and ordered pizza. Took 1 or 2 mg before ordering and felt sick before the pizza even got here. So I the mg's need is based on what's in your stomach. It works great but you can't get take what the Doctor says like 2mg's before bed because it changes.  Have the Doctor give you 90 tablets at 1mg and write take 1-3 per night as needed. We'll see if that helps and I feel your pain.",UPS

After time I began to augment and I would have to take more and more of the drug earlier in the day.  It caused all kinds of side effects from yawning to compulsive shopping.  I gained about 40 lbs and my blood pressure went through the roof.  After being on this prescription for several years, it was horrendous to get off of.  It has taken almost a year to finally say I am totally free of the DA's (dopamine agonists).  I will never, ever take one of these classes of drugs again.

Since I have a problem with chronic pain, I'm on Norco 10/325 every 6 hrs, Gabapentin 300-900mgm 3 times a day, and had been on Diazapam (Valium) 5 mgm every 4-6 hrs as needed for muscle spasms.  Well, one day I got so desperate that I took one of each of my meds and the symptoms stopped after about 45 minutes!  I was so excited as I would often have 3-4 episodes a day, not every day thank goodness!  Then, my pain management doctor stopped the Diazapam!  Really made it harder to control the RLS when it would start.  I finally upped my dose of Gabapentin, which seemed to help.  Still need some Diazapam to work.",Texas Mimi

I was prescribed Requip and it was the one of the worst nights of my life! I was terribly nauseous and vomited all night. But even worse than that was the fact that it made my RLS much worse. I had the same results with Mirapex. My doctor tried me on several other meds. None of them worked and some made the RLS worse like the Requip and Mirapex did.I ended up hurting my shoulder pretty badly and my doctor prescribed Tramadol.

When I talked to my neuro he had me switch to name brand based on side effects and it was so bizarre.  The drug works great and with zero side effects.  He said the dosing range that generics are allowed to meet is much too large for some of the neurology drugs and because pharmacy plans frequently switch which generic manufacturer they use it is impossible to avoid dosage problems as well.  The issue for me was also one of side effects from additives that were not in brand Requip but were in the generic.  Hope this helps someone.",daisygirlfp

Last night was my first night taking it and it did work. It made me extremely nauseated and gave me a massive headache, and I woke up every couple of hours. The third time I woke up, I took a diphenhydramine sleeping pill. That is important to know because generally a sleeping pill would send the RLS through the roof, affecting even my arms. No RLS symptoms after I took the sleeping pill. My head still hurts and I'm still a little nauseated, but my legs are not bothering me.
