They would start every day at about noon, when the medication was fully out of my system. I think that my dopamine receptors were dependent on it, and without it they would cause me to experience extreme physical anxiety.

5,Ropinirole,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 1, 2021",0,"I was apprehensive about using a drug primarily used for parkinsonism disease to treat my RLS. I persisted for years without any treatment.Years of poor sleep, unable to sleep in the same bed as my wife due to disturbing her. I feel emotional writing this, happy tears that I've found something which has made the condition effectively disappear as soon as I took it but sadness that I didn't do something sooner.This is a miracle drug, the side effects are worth battluig through whilst your body gets used to the drug.

6,Ropinirole,Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 30, 2021",0,"I've been taking ropinirole for about 6 months. It's changed my life. I've had RLS to some degree since I was a child. I'm 46, and for the last 10 years prior to taking the drug I seldom slept for more than an hour at a time, getting up to do wall-sits, planks and pushups just to buy another hour of sleep.  I started with one .25 mg pill but added a second pill after the 3rd night and that did the trick. Ropinirole doesn't last me the whole night but getting 5 or 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep is still miraculous to me. So far as I can tell I've had no side effects except a little dizziness at night.  I feel like its effects are diminishing, so the doctor may up my dose soon.",LBJ

My spinal doctor when I told him about my restless legs he put me on Requip. I started out at .25mgs. I thought it a God send. I have had to have my dose increased. I take 6mgs. daily. I think I need another increase. I am having occasional bout. When I was married my husband would make me go outside and walk it off even in the snow. I felt like a fish out of water. I am well aware that every medication effects every one differently.

11,Ropinirole,Restless Legs Syndrome,7.0,,"August 6, 2021",0,"I get up to the toilet twice sometimes three times a night because of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. 99% of the time I can’t get back to sleep after a night time toilet visit. This leads to severe attacks of RLS during the day. If I try to catch up on sleep in the afternoon the RLS prevents this. Usually my worst time is from around 6 to 10 pm, although it usually goes on all day, when I spend most of that period on my feet which helps a bit, but sometimes even then I get what I can only describe as convulsions in my leg which in turn causes a violent reaction sometimes resulting in me banging my knee against something. I have proved over the years that on the odd occasion when I do get a decent night’s sleep the RLS is minimal during the rest of the day. I get 30 to 36 hours sleep a week and I know that in my case lack of sleep and RLS go hand in hand, one begets the other. I’m on 4mg ropinirole a day and have been told that no way am I getting more than the 4mg.",Bally

14,Ropinirole,Restless Legs Syndrome,1.0,,"July 8, 2021",21,I thought this was a godsend. Till I started developing delusions that my wife hated me. I started spending money on useless stuff and got 100k in dept. Huge memory holes were normal. Then there was the sexual side effects. I got seriously into firearms. None of this was present before the meds! Now I'm waiting for a trial and am not able to see my wife or daughter with no job or home. These drugs can ruin your life and the FDA refuses to black box label it. I will dedicate my life to warning people once I am done with the legal repercussions and hope to God I can see my daughter again.  My doctor had no idea of the side effects and he will have to answer a malpractice suit as a result. Even the warnings only mention gambling and sometimes spending. Now I deal with severe panic attacks and depression while the justice system decides if I go to prison for what my doctor did to me. Be careful,SadPanda
15,Ropinirole,Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,,"April 16, 2021",2,I started having RLS when my husband was terminally ill. I noticed it was worse after days I stood bedside on hard tile floors. Thought my symptoms and inability to sleep was stress. After he passed they actually became worse — my shoulders and arms jerked for no reason. Dr started me on .25 mg and am now up to 1 mg/hour before bed.  I occasionally still have symptoms. When that occurs I take an additional half tablet and that seems to help.,Mrs008

Doctor tried me on pramipexole .125 mg. One a day at bedtime this last year, but It did nothing. So I am back to Ropinirole. Couldn't survive if I didn't have it.

Yes I know I'm wasting my time, just have to wait till it goes away.  When I first started having episodes, I was thinking how life was so hard because the pain is so bad there's no way to live with it.  I asked my Dr if anything can be done.  That's when she prescribed Ropinirole.  It worked like magic!  Yes I'm having an episode now.

She developed an uncontrolled secret online gambling addiction that has likely caused us to lose our home just when we were fixing to pay it off. Destroyed our good  credit rating, repossessions, etc. When I finally found out we had occurred $1800 in overdraft fees in only 4 weeks. She gambled my entire paycheck week after and fell behind on the mortgage for MANY months with huge late fees attached and developed an awesome way to hide the addiction for a long time which made the financial destruction larger than imaginable. She kept gambling anyway in hopes of eventually winning enough to fix the disaster this medicine created hoping to fix it and I would never know. Doctors and Pharmacists need to  make it a priority to council the patient about Requip and plainly asked FREQUENTLY  if the patient has found themselves gambling to help stop it before it destroys families.",Mfin

As my dose increased from two 1mg to four 1 mg I began trading stocks like I knew what I was doing.  I traded over 100,000 shares of stock a year. A couple of years later, I started reading the side effects for all my meds very closely. After reading about compulsive behavior I tried taking a few different medications, sadly, nothing worked like Ropinirole.

I took requip when it was first being used for RLS. It worked a charm. With some crazy side effects. I had to stop it after 6 months because it started to give me rebound RLS. Now if I take a Requip I will have horrible RLS. I started taking opiates for it. From my neuro who told me I had the worst case he had seen.  I have it all over. I have been suicidal. I have been miserable almost all my life. It isn’t fair to force someone with a terrible medical condition to live. Well now I take Methadone. 140 mg everyday. I no longer have ANY RLS symptoms. Yes it made me gain weight but I don’t care. I live without any RLS symptoms and that is all I care about. I would never give up this medication. If I am ever forced off that will be the end of the road for me. I can’t go back to not sleeping for weeks at a time. I used to be lucky if I feel asleep for an hour a day.,Shabbycat

A reviewer here says 'started on 2mg ropinerole and vomiting'.  Ropinerole should be started on the lowest dose, around .25mg and slowly titrated upwards and taken with food to reduce nausea.  To start on 2mg is madness.  The official guideline is that max daily dose for ropinerole is 4mg but many RLS experts (John Hopkings, Mayo Clinic, etc) say experience shows this is just asking for augmentation and the max daily dose should be no more than 1mg.Because of augmentation I knew I had to get off the ropinerole and was afraid of the withdrawals.  I was on 5mg daily and It took a year slowly weaning. Ropinerole can seem like a wonder drug but it has a high rate of augmentation.  ",PB

I was 62 then and am now 70.  The symptoms start in the late afternoon or early evening and preclude anything like sitting quietly, reading or watching a movie.

Prior to the THC, the Requip would only afford me about 4 hrs sleep a night. The THC helps with the nausea, hot flashes, and helps me get to sleep and stay asleep. Now I get 8+ hrs of sleep most nights.  If anyone pursues this course of action, BE ADVISED, start out with 5mg THC and increase as need OVER WEEKS OR MONTHS!   This combo has saved my life.

I still have breakthrough restless legs even when I take my medicine on schedule and sometimes when I do not take my medicine on time I will have restless legs for hours after I take my dose. I am having severe nausea, vomiting, sweats, flushing, hot flashes, dizziness, tiredness, etc. ",Anonymous

I'm having some minor side effects for e.g. feeling a little off color at times and bit of after taste in the mouth. So fingers crossed see if my body adjusts to these minor side effects and hopefully I'm not needing to up the dosage required to keep my symptoms at bay.,?Dave?

My RLS was so bad I would cry myself to sleep and if I was in a movie, church, or at a play I could not sit through the whole thing. I just only hope someday they will find out what causes this. I have to take 4mg a day. I take one in the morning and 1 in the mid to late afternoon and then the other 2 about 30 mins before going to bed. It feels so good to sleep all night but now I also found out peripheral neuropathy and have to take medication for that too. But as long as I take as the doctor orders I do fine.

They gave me Requip and it was great for about a month or so, no pain when I sat down which was when I always felt the pain. But like some other users I would wake up and dry vomit or vomit depends how long it was since my last meal. It was not worth the morning sessions so I stopped taking it. I hope this works for other people but I am waiting for a better option. I would like to point out also my legs didn't hurt after I threw up but it just was not worth it.",Thomas L.

It does a great job in making me sleepy and I can sleep for about 5 hours then I wake up. But I am usually able to fall back asleep. I have suffered from the symptoms returning in the early morning hours, and in the afternoon. Also if I am driving, or sitting for awhile they come back too. I have found it I cut in half the 2mg pills and keep some on my nightstand, and in my purse, if I get symptoms again, I will take a half pill and this will hold me over till bedtime. There have been times I have had to do this twice in one day. But I notice with only taking 1mg to alleviate the rebound, the sleepiness is minimal.",Anonymous

One major side effect was that I would get these headaches and it felt like there was pressure on my head. I would feel really weird like I was about to explode, the feeling was so weird that I had to stop taking it, and that major symptom disappeared. That was my experience with the trail kit. I'm on gabapentin now and no adverse side effects besides gaining a ton of weight. I don't like that either but I can deal with that better than the weird feeling with the Requip.",Michelle38
