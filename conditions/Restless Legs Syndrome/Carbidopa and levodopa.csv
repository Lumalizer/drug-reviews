0,Carbidopa and levodopa,Restless Legs Syndrome,7.0,,"July 15, 2021",0,Sinemet (carbidopa / levodopa):I have bad RLS. Have been prescribed 100 mg sinemet once a day. I have been told not to take more than one in a 24 hr period. But it doesn’t get me thru the night of sleep.  Worries to take more because I’ve been told not to. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Maybe take half at bed and the other half when it wakes me up and wears off?,Reagan

2,Carbidopa and levodopa,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 8, 2020",8,Sinemet (carbidopa / levodopa):Sinemet worked for RLS for six months then stopped.  Now it is ineffective at any dose.  Anti seizure meds don't help.  The only thing that works is Klonopin.  I'd rather not take a benzo but it beats getting slammed every night at 7 PM.  Go figure.  No increase in dosage in 19 years.  Best wishes to all.,Bieu

I developed severe RLS after having guillain barre syndrome. None of the home remedies have any effect at all. I have had to increase the dose over time and take a dose at 6pm, 8pm and when going to bed. This gets me thru the night. Sometimes I need to take in the day before a meeting or a long drive or flight etc..",Noodles

Good News / Bad News: No Sleep Apnea / YES to RLS. My doctor prescribed carbidopa/levodopa 25mg tablets 1 to 3 tablets every night before going to bed.  It's worked every night (I take 75 mg) and I've never had one issue with RLS. In 2011, I returned to the Sleep Lab and this time they discovered a mild case of Sleep apneoa, prescribed a CPAP machine, but did not find a trace of RLS . My wife could not be happier: NO more RLS and NO more snoring.",da mutt

Last year I started taking Sinemet 25/100 five times a day for Parkinson's, and, without knowing Sinemet was a treatment for RLS, I noticed that even if I didn't take Ropinirole some nights, I still didn't get restless legs. I started wondering if Sinemet was a treatment for RLS and just found out it is, although it doesn't work 100% of the time on its own.",ctpritc

While it reduces RLS, my wife still says I twitch. Side effects: cold feet, I have to wear socks at night and even during normal activities around the house. Lately, I've noticed forgetfulness, a listed side effect. Am thinking about switching medications. However, all RLS meds seem to have the same side effects. I may go to Gabapentin Enacarbil, or Horizant.",Zigpa
9,Carbidopa and levodopa,Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,,"February 8, 2018",8,I've taken Sinemet for 15 years now for RLS. I've experienced no side effects.  I actually take Mirapex at night which works well but find it wears off by the next afternoon. I take the Sinemet around lunchtime in order to carry me over until I take the Mirapex in the evening. The timing and combo work very well.,PIEVANS
10,Carbidopa and levodopa,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 10, 2017",17,"I've had RLS since a child. I began on Carbadopa in the 1990's, but I quickly became used to it, and was switched to Sinemet about 2000. It works well, with no side effects. I'm on a very low dose.Like many others here, timing is everything and there are many other factors to consider:- Take Sinemet at least 1/2 to 1 hour before you eat.- Eat early (so food digests before you go to bed).- Eat a light meal (heavy or spicy foods can amplify the symptoms of RLS).- Refrain from drinking liquids about a hour before bed.- Stress can aggravate RLS symptoms (try yoga or some other stress reduction activity).- Adjust the room temperature to be comfortable.- Maintain a healthy weight.- Exercise!!!",Kansas Sebastian
11,Carbidopa and levodopa,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 3, 2017",34,"RLS is horrible. My legs were jumping like an acrobat. Sometimes, during the day my legs would give out. My neurologist prescribed 25/100 - 3Xpd. It was a miracle drug. Stopped RLS immediately. But I had other problems. Body hurt all over and was stiff. Muscles were weak. My legs were heavy and it was hard to walk. However, the 25/100 fixed it all. I feel great! Have more energy and getting stronger every day. Cutting down on pain meds and at 68 I have a wonderful and new quality of life. I've only been taking it for 2 weeks and I am so thankful. I now sleep 100 percent better. The dose only works around 7-8 hours. I take it every 8 hours. I take it at 8:00pm and I wake up around 3-4:00am with symptoms starting again. Takes 30 min to work.",Tom Grandy

Around 9 weeks  my legs were flopping around like a half-dead fish out of water that is what my legs looked like about every 30-40 seconds all day and night unless I was walking constantly. I begged my doctor to give me something, anything. She refused. I tried every natural remedy I could think of. She finally gave me sinomet at 25/100 mg dose half a pill and it worked wonders but I noticed after a few weeks of taking it wore off faster and then my legs became worse so my doctor has  to keep increasing my dosage. I am 30 weeks now and at 2 pills a day. I take in half and quarter increments throughout the day to avoid the onset of the RLS. if taken properly it works great.",Pregnantwithrls

14,Carbidopa and levodopa,Restless Legs Syndrome,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 25, 2017",26,"Sinemet (carbidopa / levodopa):At first I thought Sinemet was the greatest thing ever.  I took it for two years and began to suffer all sorts of odd side effects which I didn't at first associate with the drug.  But the worst was one that nearly killed me.  I didn't even realize it was happening at first because I was having brief periods of blackout.  I'd be walking and suddenly feel as though the earth had shifted under my feet.  It finally happened while I was driving.  I snapped out of it, fortunately without hitting anyone or anything, but didn't know where I was.  I stopped taking it and all the symptoms I'd experienced disappeared.",Simbidia

I'm 66 now and have been taking the 25-100, carbidopa for 10 plus years.  I started with a 1/4 table, but now up to full tablet and it's barely working.  I can't imagine my life without it.  After reading posts of others, I realize some of my experiences are also related, such as short term memory loss, (I was afraid I had beginning stages of Altzeimers. I have also found I can not even think about eating anything with sugar or lots of salt near bedtime.  I wanted to share, since taking a full pill now, I have the most vivid and wonderful dreams.  Bottom line, I couldn't imagine life without it.  (Soap has NEVER worked for me).",HarleyNana
17,Carbidopa and levodopa,Restless Legs Syndrome,8.0,,"April 18, 2016",24,"I've been taking carbidopa/Levidopa (generic for Sinemet) for almost 20 years.  No side effects. However, timing is the key. I try to eat dinner very early around 5 o'clock, so the food is totally digested by 11 -12 o'clock midnight. Otherwise it could take a long time to feel results, especially if you've eaten a lot of protein or fatty foods.  It even states in the ""fine print"" of this drug that it's effectiveness is determined by how much protein you eat. I take one 25/100mg Carbidopa/Levidopa(CL) at 9:30 pm PLUS one 25/100 and one 50/200mg of CL after 11:00 pm.  My doc also prescribed half of a 10mg Flexeril to take before bed.

No one understands what it is until they've encountered it themselves. I am prescribed Sinemet and I love it. I usually only take it when symptoms start (when those legs start a feeling funny). I am very fortunate because I suffer no side effects. I do not get sleepy and it doesn't bother my stomach. I would highly recommend this medication for anyone who is unfortunate enough to suffer from this.,MasonsMommy

I have been prescribed carbidopa-levodopa 25/100 for 10 years and am currently 53 (age). While it may affect others differently, I have seen absolutely no side effects. If I am beginning to feel restless legs syndrome, this medicine seems to take about an hour to eliminate the symptoms. Since these symptoms seem to come over me as I relax into the evening, I simply take one in advance and another just before bed. I also take it just before long drives and flights. Works great for me and I hope others may be as fortunate. I tried Requip at one time but it made me groggy.",KevinP504

I took Sinemet for about a year and it seemed to work great for me. However, I could not take the full or even half of the dose because it really made me feel drowzy the following day so I would break it up and take a very small piece of the pill. Also, if you don't go to bed after taking it and stay up for a while, it can have the adverse effect on you. Makes you really sleepy, but make your restless legs symptoms worse.
