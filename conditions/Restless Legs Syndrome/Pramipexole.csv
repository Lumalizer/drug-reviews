1,Pramipexole,Restless Legs Syndrome,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 1, 2022",0,"I have been on pramipexole for WAY too many years.  It was working for me 95% of the time, but I became concerned that it's a medication you can NOT stop taking.  I tried for several months to decrease my dosage and added gabapentin.  That worked for a while to control my legs, but eventually quit working.  Now my regular dosage of pramipexole is not controlling my restlessness and I'm miserable.  I feel like this is a dangerous drug.  I would rather fight with my legs than fight with this drug.",Trishnic

3,Pramipexole,Restless Legs Syndrome,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 28, 2022",0,My mother in law began taking this drug for RLS. She became addicted to it. She was 79-80 years old. She hallucinated every night. Said someone was peeking in her windows at night and during day. Put security cameras around the house. No one was ever around at night. She slept all day and was up all night. She had hip surgery and we spent weeks detoxing her. She rubbed her legs and complained she needed that pill. She tried to trick every doctor to get more. She is in a nursing home and she is still trying that method to get it. It is a serious drug. People should be very careful with it.,Flustered

5,Pramipexole,Restless Legs Syndrome,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 27, 2021",1,"Mirapex (pramipexole):I took mirapex and requip for about 4 years. I had to stop taking it because I was climbing the walls horny, it was all I could think abut and want to do. I felt like my whole body was tingling and every touch just drove it further. I contacted my doctor and he gave me some suggestions. For instance I recently got put on lomotil for IBS and colon polyps. The active ingredient Diphenoxylate is an opiate. Opiates will always relieve RLS in like one hour but of course all Drs think we are opiate addicts. I hate Drs. I get refills any time I need them on lomotil. I threw out my requip and mirapex. I only take mirapex when I want to be super horny for my GF. I’ve had no RLS in 4 years. It’s especially good if you have klonopin to take too. I’m a nurse and work 56 hrs a week and come home and I’m asleep instantly. Because of the opiate epidemic Drs won’t prescribe meds that help. Only meds that will cause you problems.",Jay

I started out with Requip starter kit, I don't recall what the maximum mg was.  But I had gastro issue with this medication and my doctor prescribe Pramipexole ( Mirapex) 2mg before retiring.  The medication seems to be very effective in controlling RLS symptoms but does come with some unwanted side effect,  not compulsive gambling as some claim, but others issues that could be a result of taking this medication, day time drowsiness is common, I can't imagine how those who have parkinson's disesase stay awake as this medication is prescribed at much higher dosages.",Alex

You need to be aware that it can induce mania even at small dosages.  I took it nightly for my RLS for many years and it worked really well until I finally figured out I was having small, sneaky manic episodes every time I took .5 mg or more.  I switched to ropinirole and felt a HUGE difference the very next morning.  I felt at peace inside like I hadn't felt for many years.  I'm telling you it was nothing short of amazing and I still feel that way now 2 months later.  Looking back I can see that the prami was giving me this like ""dirty energy"" inside all the time I was taking it, even the next day, which was messing with my stability in so many ways.  Please be very careful if you're bipolar and taking pramipexole/Mirapex as well.  There are alternatives out there to try.",B Dogg

This medication was the worst drug I've ever been prescribed and you can absolutely bet I'm not taking it anymore. I'd rather just deal with the RLS.

I have tried all medications available and they all get to a point where they just don't work anymore! I am currently taking (3) Pramipexole 0.25 mg, (3) Cyclobenzaprine 5mg, and (2) Clonazepam 1mg to stop the RLS and help with sleeping. I also have Sleep Apnea but cannot wear anything on my face. The RLS is coming on during the day now and starting to go to my arms! I am exhausted constantly and have fallen asleep driving recently. I have short term memory loss and am very disorganized! I'm thinking of dropping the Cyclobenzaprine and asking for an increase for the Pramipexole. I saw info from John Hopkins that says they are trying Methadone and it is working. I have called, emailed and requested an appointment but no response? I have beaten my legs, tried putting them to sleep by sitting on them, tried CBD oils and even smoked weed. Nothing is helping!!!

14,Pramipexole,Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,,"February 21, 2021",3,"I tried a variety of non-drug options and herbal supplements, but my RLS continued to get worse. First prescription was neurontin. After the third day, I was extremely groggy and almost unable to function. Dr then put me on pramipexole at the lowest dose, and my RLS symptoms went away almost immediately. Over the years I have had to increase my dosage. Eventually, it was upped to one 1mg tablet at bedtime, which has been very effective until about 6 months ago. I've noticed that if I take the pill just one hour later than the night before, my legs start up. If I take it within 3 hours, it usually works quickly. But this month I've started having problems during the day, so it may be time for another dose adjustment. I also have irreversible peripheral neuropathy from taking Thalidomide as part of a drug study 25 years ago, so not sure about that impact on my RLS (which started after the neuropathy). Only negative side effect is compulsive behavior around gambling.",Cliff

I was constantly kicking people. No one wanted to sit next to me. It was embarassing. By 6/2020, I had had enough! So I saw a neurologist who started me on Mirapex. After a month or so, he would increase the dose. At one time I was taking .25mg, 3 of them, 3 times a day. It really helped me. I now take 2 tablets twice a day. It still bothers me slightly when I get in bed, but once I'm asleep, I'm fine. I have been eating more sweets than usual and put on a little weight.

It certainly worked.I've just weaned off it after speaking to a pharmacist (don't they often know way more than doctors by the way?) who said I could try magnesium tablets/day for RLS as he had many patients who had success with this.  Thinking it would not work I tried it and to my amazement it worked the very first night.  I realise everyone is different and it may or may not work for you.I'm experiencing severe withdrawals from Sifrol, the most disturbing is insomnia, I'm getting about 2 hours sleep a night.  Also foggy headed, ANGRY and dizzy, headaches.  For goodness sake GPs please please please don't just stick us on meds when you haven't done your research on less harmful things that may help.

When needed is a tough decision because, from what I’ve read, the drug could take up to 3 hours to kick in. But, for me, I have normally found relief in less than an hour. The problem is that I feel like a zombie the next day. Drowsy, cloudy head, sluggish for most of the day after taking it. I’ve started breaking the tablets in half to take down the dosage even more.

I kept making excuses for the packages arriving each day but my significant other kept pointing out that receiving six packages a day was not normal.  (I have no idea why I suddenly need a linen closet full of throw blankets I don’t use, enough chapstick for the entire town, and every subscription box available.)  As soon as my doctor found out, he decreased the daily dose back to .375 and put me on Horizant.  Oh my...the RLS is worse than it has ever been and I am still shopping online. I am hoping this will be short lived and after a few weeks my body will forget all about this drug.  Now I fear side effects from Horizant which is gabapentin enacarbil.

As it is not the extended release variety, and if I am already suffering, I chew the pill.  Sometimes, I have to take additional measures to stop the torment.

The side effects are getting much worse with the increased dose and I can feel my body needing the pill my wife calls the crazy pill! My RLS is so bad it even comes during the day mostly while driving. The worst thing I hate is the intense urge to fall asleep while driving and the insomnia at night. I sleep four hours per night and that is poor quality sleep. I tried all the other drugs for RLS and none worked so I feel doomed to take this poison till I die. Seems they can put a man on the moon and take the heart out of one person and put it in another but can't stop RLS and that irritates me greatly!

I'm shocked to hear it might cause impulse control. That's a problem for me because I used to gamble. I haven't for years but you don't have to gamble to have impulse control issues. I'm wondering if I need to up my dose. I have quit methadone for pain. I broke my neck and have taken every pain med known to man. I took it for at least 13 years. Only 10mg per night. So now doctors can't prescribe methadone  long term. So I was forced to get off it and now I have so much pain, all over my body. Add the RLS on top of all that.  So having RLS definitely reduced my quality of life. I'm so hopeful this works for me. I'm on my 4th or 5th month I think and I've gotten used to it as far as the nausea and feeling icky.
