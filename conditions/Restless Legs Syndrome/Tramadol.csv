1,Tramadol,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 11, 2022",0,"If it wasn’t for tramadol I would have possibly committed suicide by now because of my restless legs syndrome! !! I have tried everything, gabapentin, pramaprexole…etc,,, but tramadol helps me. The only thing that has helped my legs stop going crazy! Without the horrible side effects of these other medications. They make me so nauseous and sick. But tramadol makes me feel fine. I can sleep and no side effects!! So why can’t this be a prescription?!!!",Cristi
2,Tramadol,Restless Legs Syndrome,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 14, 2021",0,"I first was prescription for chronic lower back pain but noticed after a week that it stopped my RLS and I slept better. I figured the better sleep helped with my pain too. So it was win win. I took it for a few months. I noticed after the fact I felt mentally better as well. I do have mild-mod depression, anxiety, panic attacks and OCD which were not bothering me while taking it. I took 1 50mg tab a night. Anyway, I was off them for several years. Then my back flare and I started it again. Second time in my life so I was paying extra attention. A few years ago I was dx with FM and CFS/ME on top of everything else along with IBS/SIBO. Tramadol really helps EVERYTHING for me. I take 1 tab daily as needed for pain. I usually feel better body mind and spirit for about 48hr but then I feel my pains and depression again. Learning it can and has been used for many conditions other than just acute and chronic pain. I'm going to keep researching because antidepressants have not work good for me",Anonymous
3,Tramadol,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 15, 2021",3,I am a 54 year old male and I have suffered from RSL since I was in my late 20's. Over the years I have tried various medications as well as every type of alternative therapy I came across. Most of the usual medications had unfortunate side effects including altering my mood and personality (according to my wife) and none of the alternative therapies had a noticeable effect on my RSL.I was given Tramadol for pain and when I came out of hospital for an unrelated condition and was surprised to find that it also completely removed all my RSL symptoms. I have now been on Tramadol (50mg) just before bed time for over 8 years now and last year managed to reduce the dose to 25mg (liquid preparation) which still amazingly gives me a good night sleep.Outside of constipation I have no other noticeable side effects from Tramadol. I would highly recommend anyone try Tramadol (maybe start with 25mg). It has truly been a life saver for me.,Septu

7,Tramadol,Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 29, 2020",13,"I have had RLS for over 50 years.  It became ""out of control"" over 10 years ago and I began taking medication for it in 2009.  I took Ropinerole for years, but gradually had to increase the dose until I was taking 2.5 mg.  I was afraid to continue increasing the dose because what would I do when I reached the limit?  My PCP finally sent me to a neurologist and I was prescribed Horizant.  That was like a miracle drug and for about 9 months I was good with Horizant 600 mg and Ropinerole 2 mg.   A few months ago the symptoms became worse again and I had many sleepless nights.  I called the neurologist and explained my symptoms.  I told her that when I took Tramadol for back pain it also stopped the RLS.  I now take Tramadol 50mg along with the Horizant 600 mg and Ropinerole 2 mg.  I'm wondering if when taking Tramadol it is possible to reduce the Ropinerole and/or the Horizant?  Any suggestion would be appreciated.",JAH

It's a pain in the butt , but if it wasn't for this medication I would not have been a productive person. I have interstitial cystitis of the bladder and for some reason tramadol helps with both..... unfortunately I've had to cut back cause of my doctor now I'm having some pain and twitching at night. But my old doctor have me amitriptyline at night and that helped the tramadol last longer. Good luck to anyone with RLS it had been a pain in my life.....",Angel

I tolerated it until I reached my mid 40s when I finally had to see a Dr. who sent me to a neurologist who diagnosed me with RLS.  I was prescribed many of the typical RLS meds to no avail.  I got no relief, until he prescribed Ultram/tramadol.  I have been on it for over 15 years, and keep my dosage as low as possible, currently 250 mg a day.  Tramadol relieves my symptoms if I take it early enough.  Caffeine also helps me.  Recently I heard that some people use diclofenac sodium for RLS.  There is some evidence from the UK that this may provide relief.  I would like to find another medication to alternate with the tramadol, because of augmentation.",JerryS

I would be in such pain at night my Dad would have to rub my legs until I fell asleep. Back then everyone said it’s just growing pains well here I am at 2:36am in such pain. I’m wondering if anyone has more pain in one leg and if so does it go from your knee all the to the bottom of your foot? I asked Siri what can I take for this horrible pain in my legs and this popped up. I do have some tramadol left over from a previous incident so here goes. Also mine I very weather related.

I finished school, college  got married had 5 children and continue my journey with RLS. 65 yr I had thrombosis in one leg. Had Heart Bypass, finally diagnosed RLS. I am a certificated teacher.

16,Tramadol,Restless Legs Syndrome,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 3, 2019",9,"I had to chuckle when I read that Tramadol was used for RLS! I have had RLS since childhood. Was given Tramadol for pain after knee replacement surgery. In reading up on the Tramadol, I saw that it was used for RLS also. It didn’t do a thing for my RLS! I have read in other articles, that RLS may be the only observed symptom for some people with adult ADHD. Of course the other symptoms are there, but the person may not be aware of them. I have had the ADHD diagnosis for many years......just had never realized that RLS could be part of it! My doctor has prescribed a very low dose of Adderall  to use for  nighttime ADHD problems.......RLS being one of them. I have also found that drinking a cup of coffee helps with the RLS. I know this sound weird, but it helps!",SK
17,Tramadol,Restless Legs Syndrome,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 21, 2019",28,"First, to reviewers who are telling others to not take Tramadol for RLS, each person's reaction to drugs is different, so please stop.  I, too, have discovered that Tramadol stops my RLS symptoms.  I have the genetically caused version and have struggled off and on my whole life.  I did catch a break from my teens to late 20s, but it came back and grew worse.  I also have osteoarthritis in my knees and it seems when that hurts and/or my legs get cold, the RLS kicks up, but it is not limited to these triggers.  I was given Tramadol after knee surgery and I discovered it relieved my RLS. (I also discovered it helps ease/stop my chronic neuropathic cough.) On Requip & Mirapex, I keep suffering from augmentation over time and it spreads to my torso, arms and even my face and happens during the day at work.  Tramadol makes it stop so that I can work once it kicks in. With the crackdown on opiates, I am terrified my dr won't renew my rx each time I go in for it. What do I do then?",KD

I got on this site to find out what I can take for the RLS, as I wean myself off of the tramadol.  Number 1 withdrawal affect = RLS!  And here everyone is talking about getting on it.  Don't do it!  It is a severe addictive drug that will lead to many problems when you get off.  The anger, depression, lack of sleep, fatigue, achiness, and most of all RLS is enough to drive me crazy. ",Leezer
20,Tramadol,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 22, 2018",30,So similar to others in that I had spinal surgery and was prescribed tramadol for the pain. When I came off the drug my RLS (restless leg symdrome) was unbelievably bad.

21,Tramadol,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 28, 2018",34,I was diagnosed 5 years ago with RLS but suffered long before diagnosis. I just did not know what RLS was at the time.  I had surgery on my wrist and was prescribed Percocet for my pain. I hated feeling out of touch with reality and it made me nauseous. I went back to the surgeon and asked if he could prescribe me something lighter. He then prescribed me tramadol 50mg. Not only did it relieve my post-op pain but it calmed my legs enough to fall a sleep quick. I was amazed at this discovery but my doctor refuses to prescribe it for RLS.  So sad that junkies had to ruin it for the rest of us since now it’s a scheduled drug.,SandySmiles

I am a retired UPS driver and all the walking would bring on such severe issues with this I couldn't even watch TV. I had a knee replacement after retiring and used tramadol for pain. I realized I wasn't suffering the same issues with RLS! I've taken everything out there with some only making the symptoms worsen! I wished it wasn't on that dreaded narcotic list and hate that it is an opioid! I take two 50mg at night before bed.

For restless legs, this medication needs to be taken in doses of at least 100mg and for it to completely get rid of the restlessness, it needs to be taken 2-4 times a day. And while other opiates like Oxycodone or Hydrocodone start working right away, Tramadol can take up to 1-2 hours to feel the full effect. So your last dose should be taken a hour or 2 before bedtime. Tramadol does nothing for pain but for RLS, it is a God send. The max dose is 400mg in 24 hours with no more than 100-150mg taken at once.",Jenn Ivan

At the time the pain was so severe lower strength painkillers wouldn't have been enough but I've now been left with an addiction to tramadol where I've been withdrawing gradually over months and it's now left me with a bad case of Restless Leg Syndrome!  To anyone who has never had this it's a horrible feeling where you can't rest or sleep properly because of the horrible feeling going through your legs, it feels like someone is tickling the inside of your leg and you can't sit still! I haven't slept properly in months now!",LizaGLW
98,Tramadol,Restless Legs Syndrome,1.0,,"March 1, 2010",23,"I got Restless Leg Syndrome and severe lower back pain due to a horrific car accident. Tramodol made me sick so I had to stop. I have tried all the medicines you can think off, even the ones for epilepsy and anti-seizure drugs. The only thing that gives me relief from the RLS and chronic back pain is slow release morphine. Have now been on it since 1991. If people and doctors knew what living with the RLS and chronic pain is like, they would never doubt or disbelieve you again. Imagine not being able to sit or sleep or lie still anywhere or anytime, forget sleeping at nite, until you are just so physically exhausted and drained from having to move your legs constantly 24hrs a day. It's awful.",KiwiKev

104,Tramadol,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,,"May 22, 2009",96,"I have had restless leg syndrome for years. Unfortunately it is genetic, and it has been passed on to my daughter. I have tried many things and nothing works like tramadol. At this point in time, I only need 75 mg each night. I sleep all night. It has literally saved my life in terms of quality. I know the doctors don't always like prescribing it but if they had RLS, they would know how horrible it is. I would rather take this and feel great than worry about it being habit forming and feel awful. What if it is habit forming, I need it every night or I do not sleep. I take high blood pressure medicines daily and for the rest of my life so why not tramadol. I monitor my use and do all I can to remain healthy. And I have no side effects.",sleeping in az
105,Tramadol,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,,"April 19, 2009",36,"Since starting Tramadol 2 years ago (300 mg daily), I've been symptom free from restless leg syndrome with no side effects.Prior to Tramadol, I experience acute pain in legs when inactive during the evenings. A sleep study also revealed moderate leg twitching during sleep which interfered with REM. I was prescribed Requip 4mg but had a couple of very bad reactions (sudden onset of acute sweating and nausea).I also take Tramadol for mild chronic back pain. Breakthrough pain can occur due to the relatively low strength of Tramadol compared to other prescription pain relievers. However, it's more accessible due to it being a non-narcotic, non-scheduled drug. ",jeffhanna

Anyway to make a long story short I took it a few times and ended up getting addicted to it. It helps with RLS that I have and helps me sleep BUT when I'm without it I cannot SLEEP AT ALL. The withdrawal is horrible. I don't know if I should be mad at her for introducing this to me or mad at myself for getting addicted to it. If you are not prescribed this by a doctor, do not take it because you become dependent on it. I look back and I was never like this.",Carl1
