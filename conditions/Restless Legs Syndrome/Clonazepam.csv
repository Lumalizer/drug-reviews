0,Clonazepam,Restless Legs Syndrome,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 14, 2022",0,Have suffered with restless leg syndrome now for 20 years. Day and night the attacks became unbearable.Tried all the normal medications for parkinsons but made me feel so sick and didn't work until the doctor said try clonazapam she said in her opinion it was one of the best treatments. Excited and the thought of getting a night's sleep I took 0.25 first night and oh man it made it worse .So second night I took 0.5 and again within 20 mins I was really drowsy but the intensity of the restless legs was awful .I've read how this is amazing for some but sadly this drug makes mine worse .I really need help with the RLS because I'm so tired,Becky petford

2,Clonazepam,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 18, 2021",3,"Having suffered for years with RLS and gone thru several sleep study trials, ONLY one doctor dug deeper into my problem. He looked at all my paper work and especially the EEG tape and said I was suffering from ""mild"" seizures at night and prescribed Clonazepam 2mg for a trial. It was the first time in a long time I was able to sleep soundly thru the night. Only downside, slightly groggy in the morning. He said break it in half and try that. IT WORKED! Have been on it for 5 years and able to have a full nights sleep. Problem now; he retired and the doctor he referred me to doubted his findings and refuses to prescribe Cloazepam, instead wants me to take something else which doesn't work as well. My former doctor says he cannot prescribe Cloazepam or any other drug as he no longer practice medicine. The younger doctor's need to follow the wisdom of the older doctors when it comes to patients!",Relief

5,Clonazepam,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 14, 2021",1,"I’ve had RLS since I was a small child. I’m 21 now and it’s only gotten worse with time. I used to deal with it by slathering on Icy Hot every night but that’s obviously not ideal nor a cure. Earlier this year, I was prescribed 0.5mg of clonazepam for a different reason and it helped my legs sooooo much. Doing my own research, it seems that RLS is mostly attributed to vitamin d and/or iron deficiency with anemia and/or a lack of dopamine. I have all 3 of those things and when I take supplements, I’ve found that I don’t need to take clonazepam to get rid of RLS because it’s nonexistent or very mild. I do take an SSRI and a stimulant which can also trigger it but treating deficiencies helps immensely. I thought I’d put that information out there to anyone reading these who might be concerned about addiction, side effects, or anything else. I am not a medical professional at all, this is just my experience and what I found on google!",james r

As I got older it got worse, I went years without sleeping. I even chose a career where I was on my feet and not sitting, and night shift.  In my 40s they came out with RLS meds, I tried them all. Not one worked and the side effects were horrible.   I finally tried clonazepam 1mg once a day at night. I slept through the night for the first time. I have been on it for 10 years, have not increased the dosage and it still works. But the issue is the generic.  Depends on what company and color of the pill.

I'd explain symptoms, having to go sleep on the carpet so I could rub my legs on it. I'm 69 now, have been on clonazepam for 24 years, a miracle, even with increasing of dose.  Started at 0.5 mg, then up over the years to 3 mg before bed. It's getting so difficult to find anyone who is willing to prescribe it. Luckily my doc is but I suspect they are going to try and get me off it.  The main reason is memory loss. Am now additionally trying gabapentin and have tried a couple others.  Nothing as good as the clonazepam for relief.  I've read other reviews where people would rather deal with the side effects than the RLS, and I could not agree more!! (am scared about memory tho)  I sleep with rough towels or folded blankets between the sheets to rub my legs on.

The second is even after being weaned from the drug you will likely experience the sudden onset of withdrawal symptoms weeks or even months after stopping. I am also on pramipexole and  Gabapentin.",Wicked Withdrawal Symptoms
