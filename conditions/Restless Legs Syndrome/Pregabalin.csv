0,Pregabalin,Restless Legs Syndrome,7,,"February 4, 2022",2,"I’ve had RLS for 22 years. Last year I finally talked to my doctor and she put me on Requip. It did NOTHING but make me sleepy the next day. So we tried Lyrica and it is a game changer. I’m on 300mg a day and it works fantastic. No RLS and I can sleep finally. BUT I am so groggy during the day. I wish I could find a doctor who believed in a low dose opiate (not tramadol because I’m an epileptic) but until I do, Lyrica will remain my go to for this awful condition!",MovingLegs
1,Pregabalin,Restless Legs Syndrome,7,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 5, 2022",0,"I’ve been taking Lyrica 75mg for quite sometime but it’s for my back/bones problems.  Been affected with RLS for years, finally a sleep doctor recommended me taking it a bit earlier in the evening and with a womens multi vitamin.  I think it’s working a bit better but I was considering having him up the dose just a bit to see if it rids me of this horrible condition.  Good luck to all of you jumpy legged people! Lol",Judy S.
2,Pregabalin,Restless Legs Syndrome,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 4, 2021",3,No good. Did not help at all. Up all night and the side effects scare me !!  Not worth the risk.,Heather
3,Pregabalin,Restless Legs Syndrome,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 6, 2020",3,"I was prescribed pregablin for RLS and noticed straight away a positive reaction but it then quickly returned back to normal. Going up the doses doesn't seem to be making a huge difference, on 75mg I've had RLS at least twice a day for a week now. I haven't had any side affects and it hasn't affected my sleep in any way with my RLS waking me up a few times.",Zelder
4,Pregabalin,Restless Legs Syndrome,2,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 10, 2020",9,"I take pregabalin 75mg for almost two years for my spinal stenosis but did not help in my right leg tingling. There are side effect caused by this medication such as sleeplessness, weight gain, speech slurs, and memory loss. I do not recommend to use it.",Anonymous
5,Pregabalin,Restless Legs Syndrome,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 10, 2020",26,"Over the past 15 year's I have been dealing with a constant feeling of day time sleepiness.Tried meds to help me sleep, which made it worse. Did 5 different sleep studies, because everyone said that I had sleep apnea. But that was not the case. Did a brain scan which was normal. Thank God. Finally was working with a sleep doctor who said that I had idiopathic hypersomnolence. Which means that doctor's have no idea what's going on, but recognize that something is. Treated with stimulants, all which worked but not very long. Finally last year began seeing a specialist in hypersomnia. Almost immediately he tested and said that I had restless leg syndrome. It's not enough to cause pain, but it almost wakes me up constantly all night. Began various treatments, but none worked. But started taking Lyrica two months ago, so far remarkable results. Don't give up......",cozyjohn
6,Pregabalin,Restless Legs Syndrome,6,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 28, 2019",16,"Having tried 2  meds for RLS, Mirapex (which worked very well but led me to compulsive behaviours) and Neurontin (which had disappointing results), I was desperate to find a long acting medication that would help alleviate my RLS symptoms throughout the day and night. I was started on a low dose of 75 mg and gradually increased to 375 mg. Initially, I felt very encouraged by my response even though it took at least 5 or 6 days to have an effect on my RLS. By the time I had increased to 150 mg, I was sleeping much better and had no RLS during the day. Unfortunately, it appears that I am experiencing diminishing effect with my higher dosage and need to increase yet again with the unwanted fogginess I feel all morning. I wake up during the night with RLS and it last for at least 1 to 2 hours before I can fall asleep again. I am not RLS free.",Anonymous

Lyrica and Mirapex are by far the most effective medicines for me in treating restless legs syndrome.
