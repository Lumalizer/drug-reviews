0,Clonidine,Restless Legs Syndrome,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 23, 2021",1,I have been dealing with restless legs for some years. Clonidine has given me relief but it makes you very tired as well.,Patrick
1,Clonidine,Restless Legs Syndrome,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 8, 2020",3,This drug clonidine works wonders for RLS. It makes your legs feel heavy and tired. Side effects for me are tiredness and sometimes lightheadedness upon standing. I immediately have to sit down sometimes due to the drop in blood pressure. Take this as prescribed!! It will debilitate you if not. Another bad side effect is a big spike in blood pressure upon stopping usage. If quitting take half pills or even quarters.,Fred
2,Clonidine,Restless Legs Syndrome,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 22, 2019",9,"honestly not sure if it just helps me sleep despite RLS or if it actually helps the RLS. Regardless, clonidine is the only medicine I’ve tried so far that’s helped me get to sleep at a decent time. Only side effect is it makes me very moody and irritable",ap
3,Clonidine,Restless Legs Syndrome,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 9, 2017",22,Clonidine is a fantastic little medicine and is helpful for many things. I recently discovered that clonidine is 100% effective for akathisia: an extreme motor restlessness that prevents one from relaxing or sleeping.But for me I have to use a higher dose of clonidine. Doctors routinely prescribe 0.1 mg. but I didn't find that helpful for stopping the restlessness. About 0.2 mg. though and it does the trick. Akathisia gone; I can relax and sleep again. The only side effect is a really dry mouth.,Classy Jazzy
4,Clonidine,Restless Legs Syndrome,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 5, 2014",46,"Originally, I was diagnosed with Restless Legs Syndrome approximately 14 years ago.  The symptom typical  - when sitting (legs dependent) unable to find a comfortable position to relieve what I refer to as ""a sensation of agitation in my bilateral lower extremities"" and unable to find a comfortable position.  Massaging helped to relieve the sensation, but short lived when stopped.  The sensation was less obvious when laying down, positional change helped, elevation of lower extremities did little, and when walking the sensation not present.  My ""sensation"" was discussed with my physician who wrote a script for Clonidine 0.1 mg.  The only side effect I have - it still makes me sleepy after 14 years, solved by taking at bedtime, effects last for 24 hrs.",Relief with Clonidine
5,Clonidine,Restless Legs Syndrome,1,,"February 7, 2010",32,"I have tried numerous drugs for RLS, including Neurontin, Klonopin, Lyrica, Mirapex, and clonidine (and possibly 1 or 2 others).  Clonidine started out positively, giving me more relief than Neurontin.  However, unfortunately I developed a very rare severe side effect called Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (a.k.a. toxic epidermal necrolysis), which has a high death rate.  Needless to say, clonidine was D/C'd, and after lengthy treatment for SJS, I (cautiously!) tried a different drug.  Ultimately, Mirapex and Lyrica have been the best, with approx. equal effectiveness.",microSuSu
