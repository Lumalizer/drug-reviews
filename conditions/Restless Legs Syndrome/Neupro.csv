0,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 2, 2021",0,"I have used the neupro patch for over a year. I have got red patches on my body from where each patch has been, plus they have left blisters, like from a bad sunburn on these squares. My Dr. insisted I continue the treatment. My visit was a zoom , I even showed her my places where the patch scarred my skin. But I was still to continue treatment. The medication in the patch works. I have RLS so bad, I ended up with a stress fracture 2 years ago in my foot from banging it on the floor to get rid of the awful itchy, crawling feeling inside my legs and arms. But something is wrong with the reaction I'm having to the patch itself. I'm afraid to not use it, but I'm running out of places to put the patch.",Mona
1,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 6, 2021",2,"RLS earned me the nick name Manic Mike at a very early age.  I have RLS really bad and it prevents me from sleeping for days on end.   After surviving stage 4 cancer, I tell most people that cancer is child's play when compared to the problems I have in my battle with RLS. Neupro is my main defence against RLS  (and I take quite a few other drugs along with it).  Just make sure that your insurance plan cover it; my new one does not.  At around $700.00/ month, paying for this drug alone gets to be a burden.Manic Mike",Manic Mike
2,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 24, 2021",8,"I have used Neupro 6mg for 5 years.  It was prescribed by a neurologist at an academic medical center on the west coast.  I started it after 6 years on Mirapex due to the fact that I was starting to have daytime symptoms.It works well most of the time as long as I remember to put it on.  If I forget, it takes about 6 hours to start working.  If I'm sitting in the evening and start to feel a twinge, realizing that I haven't put a patch on, I am generally up until around 3am before it kicks in if I put it on that late.  I'm planning to see a specialist at another academic medical center where I live now to see if there an another ""emergency"" medicine I can take when I forget the patch or it gets knocked off.  I'm starting to have slight symptoms during the day now, so concerned that augmentation is starting on this medication.",caligirl
3,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2021",6,"Diagnosed severe RLS at 23 years old (now 40) but symptoms started at age 7.  Countless doctors and specialist, spanning internal medicine to neurology to sleep medicine.  Gabapentin, Requip, Mirapex and Klonopin completely ineffective.  Experienced augmentation on Tramadol after a couple months.  Moved up to hydrocodone, oxycontin and then to methadone (longest life) for 7+ years.  I responded VERY WELL to these opiates but was cut off by my latest neurologist.  I couldn't find a single doctor elsewhere who would prescribe any of those anymore.  Tried CBD...useless.  Kratom helped because it acts like an opioid but I needed way too much PER DAY of the ""red bali"" species.  You also build tolerance fast for Kratom and then suffer severe augmentation.  I'm posting this on Day 1 of Neupro 1mg. Sweating like crazy but I can feel a bit of relief.  Might need to use another patch if I can't sleep through the night.  Best if luck all.",I.T. Guy
4,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 14, 2020",4,"I have extremely severe RLS.  It occurs every night and some during the day.  I’ve used Neupro twice in the last few years.  The first time I used 4mg patch and it worked well.  Major irritation at application site.  Gradually, quit working well.  Have just started it again and need 6mg.  A lot of irritation at application site.  I think I’m beginning to have augmentation with it.",Anonymous
5,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 22, 2020",11,"I’ve had RLS for over 30 years. Began with legs early on but soon included hands and forearms. Been taking 4mg of Ropinirole for years but has now stopped working. Started Neupro patches on 1st September. Began with 1 x 1mg patch and 2mg (1 tablet) of Ropinirole. That didn’t do anything. Tried 2 x 1mg patch plus 1 Ropinirole (2mg), no effect at all. Now trying 3 x 1mg patch & 2 Ropinirole (4mg).First 2 nights on high dose I slept. On the 3rd night I went to bed at 10.30pm, RLS started within 10 minutes and I was still awake at 5.15am. One of the worst nights I’ve had. RLS was constant with no let up. Why are these ‘miracle’ patches not working for me?Any advice would be very much welcome.",Curly
6,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,,"September 14, 2020",18,"I have severe restless legs and periodic limb movement disorder . My restless legs made life a struggle with always waking up from the horrible sensations or just not being able to sleep. I tried requip and it made me really sick the first couple days but it worked great !!! But I started having augmentation about 2 weeks after starting it at 3 mg at bed time . I did a sleep study and was diagnosed with periodic limb movement disorder . My doctor then prescribed me the neupro 3 mg patch and it’s been great !!! Worked right away , made me groggy at first but that subsided quickly !!! I love this medication I usually feel my restless legs throughout the day and it worsens as it got later .. I have no symptoms , no bad side effect !!! Make sure you wipe the site your putting the patch on with an alchohol wipe really well and let dry then stick the patch on to Make sure it adheres good to the skin .",Jordan
7,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 9, 2020",5,I feel more rested than I have in ages. Over the last 20 years I had used two of the 4 approved RLS medications and they worked for years until they didn't. I had tried the third and it worked for RLS but it caused total insomnia.  Neupro was my last hope at this time. My only issue is it didn't stay on the first night so I suffered. Second night I wiped the application site with alcohol. I still had to try different tapes and methods for it to stay on overnight.,Jenzie
8,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2020",23,Ever since I was a child I have had RLS and it has gotten much worse over the years. I was on ropinirole and it work for many years until it wore out and  now I cannot go a night with horrible symptoms. In fact they are so bad that I never sleep and was getting to the point of going crazy and dreading night time. I just started on the Neupro patch three days ago and slept all 3 nights without any symptoms. Crazy good!I just hope this does not wear off and keeps working.Very expensive but worth the life change.,megc
9,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 10, 2019",7,"I was diagnosed with RLS and possible Parkinson’s a year ago. The neuro started me on Neupro 2 mg and it worked very well except I am allergic to adhesives. The PRN saw me and put me on 4 mg of Ropeiniorole which worked for a few months, but made me very sleepy. Then I had severe anxiety, and depression. Finally back on Neupro 2 mg and doing somewhat better, but will take time!  I feel the ropinerol was at too high of a dosage. I just want to feel normal again.",Loyll

11,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 8, 2018",21,"I've suffered with RLS for over 30 years, I am now 77. Tried all the meds popular at different times but all eventually augmented. I am now using Neuro 4 mg in conjunction with Lyrica and the results have been astounding. I have been using this combination for approx. 9 months. If I stay away from any form of alcohol I am fine. Tried non-alcohol  beer and it triggered RLS due to the very small amount of alcohol? I understand the patch also has the possibility of augmentation which I am very concerned about. I have never determined if rigorous exercise is good or bad for the RLS symptoms??Fortunately I am a veteran and able to get my Patch form the VA.",ED
12,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 1, 2018",17,I’ve been taking Neupro for 3 weeks & although it has been great reducing my RLS by allowing me to sleep through the night which I haven’t done in years but I feel like a zombie all day.  I can’t focus I feel like I’m in a daze & all I want to do is sleep.,DT
13,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,,"October 2, 2017",34,"I’ve suffered RLS for three decades. My father and probably grand mother suffered. My doctor, as a last resort, requested the Neupro patch. I’m at 2mg at 2 months, and it has changed my life. But it takes time! It did not work like magic at first. But following instructions and letting it integrate gave me that magic. I felt groggy for the first month, but that’s resolved. I sleep through the night, almost forgetting the violent RLS that lurks behind my patch.",Aunt Barney
14,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 21, 2017",33,I used neupro in the past for my restless legs and it went badly and I had to get off of it. But years later I'm on the 2mg. Now that I understand my condition better and know that some triggers like my blood sugar will make my legs act up regardless of the medicine make it a lot easier. This medicine is god sent you literally feel all the muscles relax and the bad sensations leave all at once I'm so grateful for the sleep I'm getting. Only thing is the patch burns when hot water touches it I usually take it off before a shower and only wear it at night. Best medicine out for RLS right now! Also make sure you get the coupon from neupro.com because it is pricey.,Anonymous
15,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,8.0,,"March 2, 2017",24,"I've been using the Neupro patch 1% for almost a year. My RLS is severe with involuntary movement of my legs and sometimes my arms when I am in a relaxed position. I have been tested and do not have Parkinson's. I tried Ropinirole 1%, then Ropinirole 2mg XR. Both worked well for about three years then stopped. I also tried Horizant, but the hangover and break through RLS was too distressing.  Neupro patch seems to work for now. If I've been extremely physically active or had alcohol, I will have breakthrough. I keep 1mg tablets of Ropinerole on hand for such times. Sometimes I have a skin reaction to the patch. I am beginning to think it may have something to do with diet. The more acidic foods I eat, the more it itches.",Debbiedee623
16,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 16, 2016",24,I have used the 2mg Neupro patch for 2 months and it is working very well.  The Ropinirole that I had been using was becoming ineffective around 3pm instead of the evening when I traditionally took the medication.  The Neupro patch keeps my symptoms at bay throughout the entire day.   So I am very pleased.,KarenCarib
17,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,,"November 14, 2016",17,"Tried several meds before patch, but have Crohns, so they just gave me diarrhea. I was excited about the patch, hoping it would not interfere with my colon. It has not. Although at 1 mg sample, I feel huge improvement, still not sleeping through the night, may have to go up a bit. But already feel much more awake. It seems to give me headaches, so I take the patch off in the morning and just re-apply new one before bed. It makes me fall asleep so fast, sometimes I don't get Cpap machine on for sleep apnea, so dr can see what's going on.",Sleepless in SC

19,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 7, 2016",19,"My last 5 years with RLS has has been one big circle - trying to find the right doctor who really knows something about the syndrome, thinking I found that doctor, changing meds which help for a few years then back to the nightly walks around the house, no sleep for days then the 'crash sleep' when the RŁS eases off, the miserable grogginess after the crash... Then I found a Movement Disorder Doctor who prescribed NEUPRO patches.  They also worked wonderfully for a year or so but I'm back into the 'circle.'  The NEUPRO patch is probably the best med I've tried so far but, unfortunately, it augmented too.  We're now trying a new form of Gabapentin in addition to the patch.  Hopefully this will do something to ease the nerves.",YaYagirl

All have had some form of side effects including compulsive behaviors.  I decided to try the patch and found it made me extremely sleepy during the day.  As time went on I must have gotten use to the drug and no longer feel as sleepy as before.  I wear the patch on my hip and rotate application from one side to the other to avoid itching.  I love the patch and have had no difficulty keeping it on.  I recently went scuba diving and the patch remained in place.  I have been applying the patch for over a year now and all works great!",SlapHappyBoy
21,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 10, 2016",20,I've had severe rls for about 20 years.  I used Vicodin for about 6 years.  It worked really well except for needing to take more in the middle of the night (needed extended release).  Moved to Hawaii and doctors won't prescribe vicodin.  Tried Ropinorole which worked well until augmentation began.  I've been on the Neupro patch about a year and it's been wonderful except for skin irritation.  In the last month I've started having rls sometimes when I go to bed.  I thought maybe the patch had come loose or maybe even a bad batch of patches.  I'm on a new box now and still having the problem so I guess augmentation happens with Neupro also.,Lisa125

24,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 14, 2016",24,"I had a sleep study done and had close to 300 leg movements a hr. Enough to drive anyone crazy. Not to mention no sleep. My neurologist tried requip no help, Mirapex,  no help. Then we tried neupro,  I take 6 mg patch and it is a miracle drug for me. If I miss putting on a new one I can tell in less then 5 min that I'm in for the leg war n no sleep. Only problem I had was when I applied then to the back of my shoulders, it gave me a bad skin reaction, very red and open wound.  Take to my doc he said there were 8 places to apply.  I chose my upper thighs near my hips and have not had any problems since. For me no patch no sleep. I'm also prescribed klonopin 1 mg at bedtime and 1 to 2 oxycodone  5/ 325 .

Day and night, multiple limbs. Neurologist gave me samples of NeuPro and I saw no changes at the 1mg or 2mg levels. Once I hit 4mg, however, my RLS has gotten even more severe, and shows up daily to the point where I can't sleep. It has raised my blood pressure, caused strange flickering in my eyes, and I am utterly exhausted all day. I so wish this medication would have helped.

26,Neupro,Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 2, 2015",37,"This medication has worked to control my symptoms for severe restless leg syndrome far better than any medication that I have tried since I was diagnosed.  The only time that I have breakthrough symptoms are if my patch came loose, or did not stick effectively, or if I was late changing patches.  Side effects -minimal. The only issues that I have with the medication is itchy, skin irritation at the application site. I have a sensitivity to latex and to some adhesives. The site after the patch is removed tends to be very angry red in color, & slightly raised. The irritation & itching may last for  1 to 2 days, up to a week.  I do wish that the patch came in a non-latex fabric vs the mylar. It would help w the irritation & flex on skin.",Lorrie Norris

It got progressively worse as I grew older to the point that I could barely function.  I couldn't go out to eat with friends, or a movie, or church because I couldn't sit still that long.  It was affecting my job.  My family doctor had me on Sinimet for 16 years and then my body became resistant to it.  She sent me to a neurologist which proscribed Neupro.  It was life changing for me.  I noticed such a difference within 24 hours.  I felt like I had my life back again.   I do have some side effects from it.  The spot where the patch is on at times drives me crazy because it itches.  It does make me somewhat irritable at times.  Is it worth the side effects?  You betcha!!!!",Anonymous

It has changed my quality of life extremely! But the patch doesn't stay on well so I use paper tape to keep them on the whole 24 hrs.  Was able to get a reduced payment on medicines for $10.00 a month for 12 months for 30 day supply. Insurance would not cover it.,Carmar
