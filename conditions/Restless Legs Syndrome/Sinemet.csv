0,Sinemet,Restless Legs Syndrome,7.0,,"July 15, 2021",0,I have bad RLS. Have been prescribed 100 mg sinemet once a day. I have been told not to take more than one in a 24 hr period. But it doesn’t get me thru the night of sleep.  Worries to take more because I’ve been told not to. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Maybe take half at bed and the other half when it wakes me up and wears off?,Reagan
1,Sinemet,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 8, 2020",8,Sinemet worked for RLS for six months then stopped.  Now it is ineffective at any dose.  Anti seizure meds don't help.  The only thing that works is Klonopin.  I'd rather not take a benzo but it beats getting slammed every night at 7 PM.  Go figure.  No increase in dosage in 19 years.  Best wishes to all.,Bieu
2,Sinemet,Restless Legs Syndrome,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 10, 2020",22,"I have been taking sinemet for many years for restless legs  (RLS) and it's the only thing that works. I developed severe RLS after having guillain barre syndrome. None of the home remedies have any effect at all. I have had to increase the dose over time and take a dose at 6pm, 8pm and when going to bed. This gets me thru the night. Sometimes I need to take in the day before a meeting or a long drive or flight etc..",Noodles
3,Sinemet,Restless Legs Syndrome,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 15, 2018",13,"I've been taking 50mg of Sinemet for RLS every night, just before bed. While it reduces RLS, my wife still says I twitch. Side effects: cold feet, I have to wear socks at night and even during normal activities around the house. Lately, I've noticed forgetfulness, a listed side effect. Am thinking about switching medications. However, all RLS meds seem to have the same side effects. I may go to Gabapentin Enacarbil, or Horizant.",Zigpa
4,Sinemet,Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,,"July 7, 2017",7,"I am going on my 5th pregnancy with boy number 5. Around 9 weeks  my legs were flopping around like a half-dead fish out of water that is what my legs looked like about every 30-40 seconds all day and night unless I was walking constantly. I begged my doctor to give me something, anything. She refused. I tried every natural remedy I could think of. She finally gave me sinomet at 25/100 mg dose half a pill and it worked wonders but I noticed after a few weeks of taking it wore off faster and then my legs became worse so my doctor has  to keep increasing my dosage. I am 30 weeks now and at 2 pills a day. I take in half and quarter increments throughout the day to avoid the onset of the RLS. if taken properly it works great.",Pregnantwithrls

I take one every night before bed.But I have recently stopped taking it and turned to using essential oils instead, I have not taken a Sinemet for the last 10 nights and have had no issues with my RLS!But I would recommend it to any one who is looking for relief from the symptoms! Myself I prefer natural ways to help with my ailments!",Pamda
6,Sinemet,Restless Legs Syndrome,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 25, 2017",26,"At first I thought Sinemet was the greatest thing ever.  I took it for two years and began to suffer all sorts of odd side effects which I didn't at first associate with the drug.  But the worst was one that nearly killed me.  I didn't even realize it was happening at first because I was having brief periods of blackout.  I'd be walking and suddenly feel as though the earth had shifted under my feet.  It finally happened while I was driving.  I snapped out of it, fortunately without hitting anyone or anything, but didn't know where I was.  I stopped taking it and all the symptoms I'd experienced disappeared.",Simbidia
7,Sinemet,Restless Legs Syndrome,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 19, 2015",26,I have to take more and more. It wears off fast. I also get constipated and itch like crazy from it!,lizzann
8,Sinemet,Restless Legs Syndrome,7.0,,"August 30, 2015",14,I have been using carbi now for several years and it is a great drug. But I have a problem in the summers. When it gets hot I start getting High Uric acid (gout). I would like to know if any one else has this problem. And if so what did you do. What did your Dr do? ,KarenEdgemon
9,Sinemet,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 19, 2013",125,I have been on Sinemet for at least 15 years. I have not had to raise the dosage due to augmentation as of yet. This is the very first medicine I tried for restless legs syndrome and it works so well for me I don't feel the need to try the newer medicines. I have had restless legs syndrome since my teens and am now hitting 60.,deej416
10,Sinemet,Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,,"May 14, 2013",106,I worked on my feet for 10  years now and developed restless leg about 2 years ago. No one understands what it is until they've encountered it themselves. I am prescribed Sinemet and I love it. I usually only take it when symptoms start (when those legs start a feeling funny). I am very fortunate because I suffer no side effects. I do not get sleepy and it doesn't bother my stomach. I would highly recommend this medication for anyone who is unfortunate enough to suffer from this.,MasonsMommy
11,Sinemet,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 13, 2012",104,"This has been a God send for me. I have been prescribed carbidopa-levodopa 25/100 for 10 years and am currently 53 (age). While it may affect others differently, I have seen absolutely no side effects. If I am beginning to feel restless legs syndrome, this medicine seems to take about an hour to eliminate the symptoms. Since these symptoms seem to come over me as I relax into the evening, I simply take one in advance and another just before bed. I also take it just before long drives and flights. Works great for me and I hope others may be as fortunate. I tried Requip at one time but it made me groggy.",KevinP504
12,Sinemet,Restless Legs Syndrome,8.0,,"February 20, 2012",57,"I have had restless legs syndrome for years due to iron deficiency. I took Sinemet for about a year and it seemed to work great for me. However, I could not take the full or even half of the dose because it really made me feel drowzy the following day so I would break it up and take a very small piece of the pill. Also, if you don't go to bed after taking it and stay up for a while, it can have the adverse effect on you. Makes you really sleepy, but make your restless legs symptoms worse. Good Luck!",Amy Darrell
13,Sinemet,Restless Legs Syndrome,8.0,,"January 20, 2012",52,"I suffer from restless legs syndrome since 14 years ago and been taking Sinemet since. The only medication that works for me but only lasts for 2 to 3 hours then need to take again. For about nearly 2 years I came to realize that after eating food or drink contain msg/monosodiom glutamate - 621,627 which will contribute my suffering so if I eat less of this and will be less suffering.

15,Sinemet,Restless Legs Syndrome,5.0,,"October 2, 2010",31,"I have Restless legs both at night and during the day.  The Sinemet helps some at night, but doesn't last through the night.  I can't take it during the day because it makes me sleepy and upsets my stomach.  If I take it with food it doesn't work at all.I have a heart condition, so there are some medicines I can't take.",Pat621
