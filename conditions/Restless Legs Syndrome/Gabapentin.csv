This is a very dangerous medication if taken for a long period of time that has a withdrawals that will have you on your knees begging for  mercy…vision loss, anger outbursts, burning tingling brain skin, suicidal thoughts,  inner restlessness that makes you want to crawl out your skin - just to name a few of the fun side effects trying to come off this awful  medication.

5,Gabapentin,Restless Legs Syndrome,9.0,,"February 24, 2021",8,"On my first two weeks of 300 mg Neurontin for restless leg syndrome I noticed an immediate effect. My legs stopped wanting to urgently move around in the middle of the night. The symptoms currently are not all gone, I still want to pace sometimes, but it is vastly improved. It helped with my pins and needles too. The dose got raised to 400 mg and I'm experiencing greater symptom relief. In the beginning I didn't think it was great for insomnia, but with the higher dose I'm experiencing more ease getting to sleep. I'm still waking up in the middle of the night. However, I'm willing to try higher doses to see if I can fall asleep, stay asleep and sleep longer. I have tried Trazadone and it did nothing for me, mixtures of melatonin, Banophen and cold medicine. I had Klonopin and Ativan for emergencies but the doctor won't prescribe it. The doctor has no trouble prescribing Neurontin. I also experience no side effects, so I am hoping time with further treatment will help.",Elly
6,Gabapentin,Restless Legs Syndrome,6.0,,"February 15, 2021",13,"Great information and feed backs from taking Gabapentin. I've been taking Gaba since 11/20 that had a bad side effects first. My doctor's advised me to take on 100 mg a low dose up to 600 mg. It worked great for few weeks...then my legs were driving me crazy again. The doctor told me to increase to 300 mg after dinner 900mg in bed time. Again, I was not able to function day time because of a bad side affect. So last night I skipped 300 mg, only tool 900 mg bed time, but I still had a same side effect today. Gabapentin supposed to help sleep deprivation, but my case isn't working at all. I take combinations of CBD, CBN and THC at night and working good to sleep. By the way, I'm 75 yr old female never thought about taking cannabis in my life ever!!

Several years ago I was diagnosed with General Anxiety and was prescribed an SSRI and when that stopped working I was prescribed an NSRI (Cymbalta). My RLS got so bad I was trying anything. I tried CBD oil and failed a drug test... so, no more CBD oil... went to a neurologist and she took one look at my allergy medications and my anxiety medications and tells me both are know RLS causes/enhancers. Cymbalta is a very well known trigger for this condition. I stepped down from the Cymbalta and my RLS is so much better. I stopped taking Benadryl and any allergy med ending in dine.

I tried every drug which was prescribed as being specifically for RLS. None worked. An article in a RLS website mentioned Gabapentin as a medication that works. My doctor at the time refused to prescribe  it. So I found another doctor. Started out at 600mg as needed and it worked! Then I had the first of 7 back surgeries  and the RLS became a nightly problem. He upped the dosage to 1200mg daily and haven't had a single twitch since and sleep well, for about 5 hours then it stops helping me sleep, but no twitches. No side effects, no problems whatsoever.

Last night for the first time I took 300mg of gabapentin before bed and for the FIRST time in what seems like forever, I was able to have some actually good restful sleep. I did experience some dizziness when I woke to use the toilet in the middle of the night, but what usually would have been a terrible time getting back to sleep, it was not bad at all. I did have two occasions with knots and spasms in a calf and thigh, but I put on a heat pad over those areas and drifted off to sleep easily.

Started on them 2 years ago due to paresthesia in my face (tingling/numbness) and it worked like a charm, but also fixed my RLS totally! I never had one single RLS episode for  22 months till last month, and its back with a vengeance after a hip replacement op. Daytime also, both legs and both arms. I threw my phone by accident the other day. I'm hoping its just a passing phase again, and I'm persisting with the Gabapentin, but adding one extra tab in the afternoons to see if I can control it, as I could chop off my legs (metaphorically) sometimes.

Sleep evades me and exhaustion has become so prevalent in my life. The symptoms now occur in the daytime as well as the night.  If I sit or lie down I am in  agony.

26,Gabapentin,Restless Legs Syndrome,1.0,,"August 2, 2019",16,"I had taken Mirapex for about 12 years, and though my RLS symptoms had abated, there were a few problems:  I had to annually get a higher dosage (which should have been a red flag for my doctors and myself) and there were severe behavioral side effects which started insidiously and ended up terribly.  As a result, I discontinued taking Mirapex and took no drug whatsoever for RLS for 3 years.  It was a miserable 3 years, but I did discover within that time that RLS seems to somehow be a dopamine issue, so I did whatever I could right before bed to trump up my dopamine levels:  vigorous exercise, sex, and chocolate/sweets.  If it was a really bad night, then all three methods were employed!  I have a new physician and she suggested I try gabapentin at only 100 mg to start.  Within 5 nights, my RLS was much worse, with one leg jerking so badly it flew up in the air.  Gabapentin doesn't seem to work for me, so I guess I'm back to vigorous exercise, sex, and chocolate.",Nonickname

The past 6 months RLS has been intolerable, all night every night.  I've been taking Gabapentin for two weeks, 300mg at night. Side effects at first red flushing, dizziness, clumsiness and for one morning (1 hour) weird dark mental  thoughts .  Now body adjusted I’m sleeping great, RLS and side effects gone.  I feel happier.  Having RLS so long and lack of sleep I thought my normal mind was normal, but now I feel happier I am not sure if it is that I am now sleeping or  the gabapentin itself or combination.

I still had RLS from time-to-time but would take my Ambien (and years later, an earlier dose of Klonpin for anxiety) and it didn't matter.Fast forward many years and kids later, after a cervical disk injury, I was put on gabapentin (later, Gralise) for nerve pain. It didn't occur to me that my RLS had faded away too, until I phased out the Gralise because of the side effects and my RLS came back with a vengance. I've restarted a smaller dose of Gralise and it has helped tremendously.Be forewarned - on high doses of gaba (about 1200mg 3x/d or 1800mg Gralise 1/d), I had weight gain, bloating, forgetfulness, psychological numbness/foggy thinking. Still, it was worth it for the nerve pain. For RLS, gabapentin is shorter-acting, so try to be on the lowest dose possible. Gralise is a long-acting version.",AlphaGirl

102,Gabapentin,Restless Legs Syndrome,10.0,,"October 10, 2012",131,"I have been taking Tramadol for RLS for three years. It worked absolutely wonderfully, and any time I ran out or stopped for some reason, I had no withdrawal symptoms at all. Also, I never felt like I was dependent on it, nor addicted to it. It helps that this is a non-narcotic medication. At the beginning of this year, my doctor added gabapentin 300mg/night. With this combination, I must say, I have never had a more restful night's sleep in my entire life. I wake up refreshed, not groggy at all, and ready to hop right out of bed and take on the day and the world.",Anonymous
