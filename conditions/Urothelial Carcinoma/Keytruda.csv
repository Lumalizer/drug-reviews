0,Keytruda,Urothelial Carcinoma,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 11, 2021",2,"After chemotherapy, my husband went into partial remission. When he came out immunotherapy was prescribed, and he had his first Keytruda infusion 12 March with no noticeable side effects.  The second Keytruda in April resulted in dramatic effects: hospitalization, respirator,  myasthenia gravis, cardiomyopathy, and death 8 May.  Keytruda is listed on his death certificate as a contributing factor, with cancer as first.",Widow
1,Keytruda,Urothelial Carcinoma,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 7, 2021",3,"My husband started keytruda June 2021. The first treatment landed him in ICU with severe adrenal insufficiency. ""They"" said it was causes by a reduction in Prednisone not the keytruda. I knew better. I've been with him to all appts and treatments since his cancer was diagnosed in 2014. When he had a biopsy and it was decided he was a candidate for keytruda the oncologist was elated. Prior to starting keytruda my husband was walking, talking, driving and living a normal life despite cancer. Keytruda was hailed a miracle miracle drug because my husband had a rare genetic mutation that qualified him for keytruda. He had four doses total and each one made him so sick we were at the oncology office three times a week for fluids and whatever else they put in the saline bag. He started Keytruda June 2021 and currently he is laying in our living room dying under hospice care. The Dr dropped my husband and offered no explanation. I am heartbroken.",Puddin
2,Keytruda,Urothelial Carcinoma,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 10, 2021",2,"My husband started Keytruda for recurrent Bladder Cancer Stage 4 in January '21.  Oncologist said probably won't see side effects for weeks - not so.  Next day he started with terrible arthritic pain, dizziness, fatigue, stiff neck, nauseated, unsteadiness in walking.  This persisted and then they gave him steroids. The steroids helped a little but not much.  Took treatment until May '21 and had ""numerous blood clots"" in his lungs. 3 days in ICU with infusion to break up the blood clots caused from this horrible drug.  Now on heavy blood thinners, has had diarrhea for 8 weeks and Oncologist has sent us to Gastrologist.  He's also suffering from severe neck issues as his neck droops - another side effect of this terrible drug.  He's worse now then when he went through Chemotherapy and they removed his bladder.  This has been a horrible drug from the get go - DO NOT USE IT!! PLEASE! It's not worth it...",Nancy York
3,Keytruda,Urothelial Carcinoma,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 22, 2021",4,"My father was diagnosed August 2020 with urothelial cancer. Had left nephrectomy and uretorectomy in Sept 2020.   Wasn't a candidate for traditional chemotherapy for age and other health issues.   Started Keytruda February 24th. 2nd treatment was March 24.  April 9th we were in the emergency room with him having large blood clots in his leg.  May 5th he is worse, not walking low blood pressure and severe pain. Put in hospice and now gone on May 20th.  I will regret forever talking him into trying it.",kmh1967
4,Keytruda,Urothelial Carcinoma,1,,"January 13, 2021",8,"My husband was diagnosed with bladder cancer 6/20. Tests showed his cancer was Stage 4 with lung mets.He started with a GC combination chemo, but almost halfway through treatment, it was not working.  His lung mets had gotten larger. Now he had bone mets on his left hip and pelvis.He was put on Keytruda end of 09/20.  For the first 7-8 weeks, he improved to 95% full functioning.  After the 2nd Keytruda treatment, he began to fail gradually, where he is now at 10% functioning.His 3 month CT scan showed his tumors in his lungs and hip/pelvis were larger, and he now had liver mets.  While waiting the standard 3 months to see if Keytruda was working, his condition continued to deteriorate.The appearence of pseudo-remission initially led to false hope, and the devastating experience upon the deterioration in his condition.  I suppose the only other alternative would have been to not have treatment at all during these past 7 months.",DW's Wife
5,Keytruda,Urothelial Carcinoma,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 23, 2020",5,This drug Keytruda did absolutely nothing for my moms cancer. In fact I think she would she’s been better off without this treatment at all. Do not use keytruda it’s worthless.,Beachgirl
6,Keytruda,Urothelial Carcinoma,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 31, 2020",9,"My brother, who was a healthy 70 year old, was diagnosed with bladder cancer. After 6 chemotherapy treatments, which were somewhat beneficial, he was given one dose of Keytruda. Although his Doctor told him ""most of his patients don't have any side effects and if (he) did it would be in 5-6 weeks"". Within two weeks, my brother ended up back in the hospital and passed away 5 days later. His records are clear in stating that the Keytruda caused multi-organ failure. He died 5 days later.Keytruda is a very bad drug and should not be available for use. ",drugs1950dianne
7,Keytruda,Urothelial Carcinoma,1,,"May 19, 2018",22,"My husband died right after second dose. After the first dose he suffered very badly for next three weeks. He told the RN he is in pain but she sent him for the next does and very next morning he had severe pain all over and specially up back.  I read every comment here before my husband started Keytruda but I wish I could understand this medication better. Now I know what this medication did to my husband. He lost his voice and couldn't sit, walk, talk, and he was just crying and asking what is going on?. Why is this happening to me? Your loved once could die worse than a death by cancer from cancer.",Eddie
