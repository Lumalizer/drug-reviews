0,Opdivo,Urothelial Carcinoma,1,,"September 16, 2020",13,"My dad was dx with SCCB, underwent chemo. After that, cystectomy w neobladder from parts of his intestine. The surgeon at MSKCC is top in the nation. Months later, a CT w biopsy showed metastasis in his lung, did fine with the Ipi/Nivo combo, but when switched to the Opdivo alone, he has been having more issues than when he was first diagnosed. Fatigue, low BP (80/50), anorexia, insomnia, anxiety, depression, mood swings, vision problems, eosinophilia, anemia, and the list goes on. After reading the reviews on this medication, I’m trying to make sure he is not given it again. It has led to more specialist visits for him than ever. Everyone needs to discuss quality of life versus quantity with their loved ones, prior to starting these meds. If one is constantly in pain, unable to eat, sleep, think straight, is constantly exhausted and fatigued, etc. is that really even living? It’s heartbreaking, to say the least. It may work for some, but for others, it has done the opposite.",fLB
