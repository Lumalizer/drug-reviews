1,Keytruda,Hepatocellular Carcinoma,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 20, 2019",11,I did five treatments with keytruda and my tumors were stable up until the 5th where they doubled in size so  I immediately stop keytruda.  Now  I am currently taking lenvima 10 mg pill once per day we'll see how that works out not very hopeful though seems like I'm running out of options.,Bigpappa
