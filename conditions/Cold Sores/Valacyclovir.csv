If you take in time it sometimes stops the cold sores completely. It's all about the timing... For me I get a tingle in jawline, I take 2 grams right away. Then 2 grams when I get home or 12 hours later. That's it.. best thing other than a cure",Bust123
1,Valacyclovir,Cold Sores,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 24, 2022",0,"I’ve been getting about 1 cold sore/year for the past 10 years always lasting nearly two weeks. Last year, my doc prescribed me Valtrex when one popped up - on Thursday I took 2, 1g doses in the AM and 2 at night, by Friday it was a small scab and by Saturday gone. One year later, I was in the sun all day and around 5pm noticed my lip itching. Around 7pm, immediately took 2. Before I went to bed it had gotten bigger and by morning I had a fat lip with two small blisters. Took another 2 Tuesday morning. Through Wednesday it wasn’t noticeable but still felt swollen. Waking up Thursday morning it’s almost completely gone. This is the ONLY thing to ever work for me. Typically I notice the tingle only hours before blisters develop so both times I’ve taken it by the time it’s present and it has worked. Everyone’s body is different, and it doesn’t magically zap it away in an instant but basically cuts down the lifetime from 14 to 3 days.",Anonymous

This year December 1st I got a cold sore and I called the Dr because I was low acyclovir, he was adamant that valacyclovir was the new updated acyclovir, it is NOT, this drug made me get 3 consecutive cold sores, I took a full dose when I got the first cold sore on December 1st, the cold sore still came out full force thought maybe I caught it late, then Dec 19th  I got the biggest coldsore I’ve gotten in over 10 years since I started acylovir, took it as soon as I felt it, but sore still came out HUGE,  then I got another the 26th!

6,Valacyclovir,Cold Sores,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 12, 2021",0,"I acquired cold sores as a child, never could figure out how. 30 years later and I still get them once every 4 to 12 months. This medication is pretty good. It does not stop or minimize the early effects for me, even when taken upon first sign of an impending cold sore. For me what it does is just speeds up the whole process. The most painful symptoms of the sore arrive earlier and don't last as long. The healing is usually modestly to moderately faster than without it, but there are occasional exceptions (such as if your initial sore symptoms start while you are sleeping, and by the time you wake up it's too late to get the med's full effectiveness... again the earlier you take this the better. If the sore is already visible by the time you start the med you will likely only see modest or minimal improvement). I'd say this medication has reduced the average time that the sore is noticeably a cold sore from what used to be 1.5 to 3 weeks down to 4 to 9 days.",MetalMastodonASD
7,Valacyclovir,Cold Sores,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 19, 2021",0,"Valtrex (valacyclovir):I am 20 years old and I have suffered from cold sores my entire life. I get between 2-3 breakouts every year regularly and it’s triggered by sickness and stress. In middle school I started using Abreva for relief but 4 years ago it stopped working altogether. Around that time I was prescribed my first dose of Valtrex and it is a lifesaver. When I feel tingling or blisters on my lip/chin, I immediately take my first dose and Valtrex freezes the progression. If the cold sore has already formed, it only stays for about a week on it, when previously my cold sores would last for weeks sometimes an entire month. If you frequently get cold sores like me, I would suggest getting Valtrex before you have a breakout. Since Valtrex freezes the progression of the outbreak, sooner is better, even a few hours makes a difference. I would 100% recommend because out of the 10+ times I have used it, it worked in shortening the time/severity of my cold sore outbreaks.",Anonymous 1
8,Valacyclovir,Cold Sores,10.0,,"July 4, 2021",2,"Valtrex (valacyclovir):Recently had a breakout, I haven’t had one in almost two years. The last time I had one I went to urgent care and the doctor prescribed me Valtrex. I was a couple of days into the outbreak but saw a MAJOR difference it made in symptoms such as pain and swelling.This past Monday a bump appeared on my bottom lip and I took Valtrex. Anyone who has experienced these outbreaks know how painful and embarrassing they are. So of course my mind just went to a sad place. LUCKILY Valtrex kicked in right away! I didn’t have the awful swelling or pain! Only one blister came about and weeped. Got a scab on day three and it has basically gone now…the scab fell off last night. So what would have lasted 10 days cleared up in 7 and that’s probably only because I waited to take it rather than right away. Already got my prescription refilled. I’m so happy I was introduced to something that not only relieves symptoms but clears up these nasty breakouts quickly!",Rae

I immediately bought Abreva which honestly doesn’t help. So at 2pm Tuesday I had a bump already forming on two spots of my lip. I took 2 of the valacyclovir pills 2000mg and the blisters progressed and it was slightly swollen. I went to bed and took another 2 pills at 2am. When I woke at 8 one had completely gone down but the other progressed to a bigger blister but no pain. Usually I get them so bad I have to ice it for pain due to swelling. I waited until 9pm the next day and decided to take 1 pill again since it wasn’t gone completely on Wednesday night. Thursday morning it was practically unnoticeable and had a slight yellow scab. I also took one pill this morning Thursday. I can definitely say I never had a cold sore blister and dry up this fast usually it’s a 6-10 day process.

My face got burned as well as my lips. Today is Tuesday and I woke up with about 4 red patches that burn across my bottom lip, my birthday is on Saturday so needless to say I couldn’t wait. I’ve tried everything-abreva to actually poking holes in my lips and applying salt and rubbing alcohol to try to dry them out. I COULDN'T DO IT. I contacted an online doctor and they prescribed it in about 5 minutes.

This time, I didn't do it quite soon enough and sure enough, my nose (where I happen to get my cold sores annually, it seems) got red, tingly/itchy, just awful. I started the Valacyclovir protocol—and while I had a few white blisters, it interrupted the process and turned into a scab almost immediately. I can't tell you how relieved I am. My last terrible cold sore before Valacyclovir resulted in a facial ulcer—no joke—that was like a blobby hitler mustache. So painful and so unattractive.

They are very embarrassing and even more painful. They were all over my face, like multiple blisters when I went for my Pap smear years ago. When he saw them, my OBGYN gave me a prescription for once a day Valtrex. I took it daily for a year and didn’t get an outbreak for 3 years. Then, I had to start taking it daily again. After stopping for another year, I started getting them on my cheeks and mouth again. Taking 4 twice a day for one day at the first sight of one hasn’t been helping and another just comes back somewhere else, so I have obtained a 90 day prescription and plan on taking it daily for longer than a year for suppression.

I was prescribed Valtrex about 10 years ago as needed for outbreaks. The outbreaks lessened in recent years, to maybe 1-2 a year, and shorter/less painful. However, in the last 6 months I've started having recurrent outbreaks, about once every 4-6 weeks, age, stress most likely. My doctor started prescribing me valtrex daily. Today, I got up from bed and had a very small cold sore on the corner of my mouth. Very frustrated and took an additional 1g tablet to help, and thankfully, it hasn't become worse. Will see over time if it works on frequency. I will say, valtrex has helped shorten the duration (now just a few days compared to weeks before), lessen the severity and pain (now small, barely there ones). In rare occasions, I've been able to stop an outbreak before it occurs, but that's so hard to do.

I like to pair it with the cream version of this as well. The pharmacist says that the cream is less effective but I find pairing them together helps get rid of them faster, and it’s convenient to have in my purse if I ever run out of the pill form while I’m away. The only problem with the cream is my lips dry up, but it is better than having a large cold sore! If I’m experiencing a full blown cold sore because I caught it too late, I will take 1g every 6 hours 4x to prevent it from spreading. I usually get 2-3 at a time unfortunately.

After talking to my doctor he prescribed me Valacyclovir and I decided to keep a refill with me. This week I woke up with tingling on Monday. Took my first dose 6 hrs after (4 caps, 500mg). Another dose 12 hrs later. While a small cluster of blisters formed, they were hardly noticeable at all. Today is Wed. evening and the sore is pretty much flat. Never got red, bigger or reached the weepy oozing stage. A little over 48 hrs later and it’s literally gone. Just a small dry patch. I came across this forum the last time I had one and didn’t have access to a prescription. If that’s you, ride it out, but know a game changer is available. See your doctor ASAP & keep capsules handy. Don’t let cold sores rule your life.

41,Valacyclovir,Cold Sores,10.0,,"April 9, 2019",6,"I was infected by herpes as a child and have had a pretty devastating long-term affliction with them. The last few years the coldsore outbreaks have been slowing down and I only get about four outbreaks a year, and I've been taking Famciclovir the moment I feel the tingle. Once or twice in this time (so out of maybe, 25? outbreaks), the Famvir has stopped the coldsore from appearing. More often though, it just helps with the pain and may shorten the 14 days to 12. Recently my GP prescribed me Valacyclovir as a treatment (two tablets, for five days). Had an outbreak last week at 10am, took the first tablet as soon as I could at midday, no real effect. Second tablet in the evening, and third tablet the morning of the following day. By this stage, the coldsore had been arrested, was not sore. By the third day (after only four doses), it had gone, and I was only left with a slight redness and some flaky skin. So valacyclovir is my miracle drug for cold sores.",Ruth

Anyone who gets cold sores knows how awful they are and how long they take to heal.  I have not had as much success with acyclovir.Be sure you always have some Valtrex on hand.  If you wait until you get a cold sore before calling the doctor, it's probably too late, but take it anyway to reduce healing time.",demothegreat

I have been plagued by cold sores regularly since a young girl and just the last few years my outbreaks have been considerably lessened to about once a year, more recently it's been almost two years since my last one. When at the doctors a few months ago, I knew the winter time was the most frequent time for me to get a cold sore I requested a prescription from my doctor and she prescribed Valtrex. This morning, I woke up with tightness is my lip, no tingling, and immediately took my first dose of it ever and it got progressively worse all day.

If you are not taking this dose that would be the reason it does not work for you.  Some will heal with less but I suggest that your first time taking it, you take as is FDA suggested.For me at least (50 years of cold sores), if the sore is already in progress then TWO grams at least for the first dose is absolutely necessary.  I then judge later at the 12 hour mark whether it is already responding and may only take 1 gram.  If I catch it at first tingle then I get by with a single gram every 6 hours for 3 doses only.

With all that said, Valtrex is the real deal.  A cold sore is a Virus (as I'm sure you all know by now) that injects its own foreign DNA into your cells which in turn mutates them which is why you get a cold sore - the way Valtrex works is by blocking the viruses ability to inject its own DNA into your cells.  So, if you take Valtrex at the FIRST sign of ""tingling"", you may never develop a cold sore.
