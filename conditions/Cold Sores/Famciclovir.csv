0,Famciclovir,Cold Sores,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 15, 2021",0,As good as other mention. I have had them most of my life (thanks Mum!) and am old enough to recall the only treatment being a menthol type cream.

Then Blood Pressure high & was put on 2 BP TABLETS, investigated adrenals, As I had op ahead, BP must be under control.Since, I've had cold sores x 4, had Famciclover & great results. This time, I had it Mon, felt OK til 4 days later felt weird in head, nausea, was sure BP was up. Home BP test almost 200/98.

5,Famciclovir,Cold Sores,,,"June 14, 2020",1,I woke up with a with a cold sore on corner of my lips. Went to the chemist and they gave me this one dose 3 tablets. I took it at 1pm. 30 minutes later my heart started racing and I felt awful. I drank a big glass of water which helped a little. 2 hours later I developed a headache. By night I felt better but still have heart pounding time to time. I suffer form irregular heady beat myself and to experience this on top wasn’t nice. I don’t think I take this ever again and will use cold sore cream instead next time.,Sherry

7,Famciclovir,Cold Sores,10.0,,"November 28, 2019",5,"Its a christmas miracle. I have had cold sores since about 5 years ago - on and off with about a 2 or three year gap in between. This time around I didn't even get the tingle which of course came as a shock to me that after the end of an extremely tiring day I looked in the mirror and there she was - in all her disgusting glory AND right in time for my christmas party in 3 days. I raced straight to the chemist for an over the counter dose of famciclovir. Being my first time using it I also grabbed some compeed pads (which I used for 2 and a half days) as I have found them very useful for hiding the sore. I had no side effects at all from taking the dose and low and behold 2 days later my sore is COMPLETELY gone. No blistering, No scarring, no disgusting fluids, no cold sore. This is the stuff of miracles and I would assume that if I did have the tingle the tiny sore wouldn't have even showed in the first place. I can't recommend this enough - life changer",Kane
8,Famciclovir,Cold Sores,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 2, 2019",4,"I used to get cold sores often. Then discovered over the counter cream that helped at first, but after several uses I stopped feeling tingling before the cold sore would appear, and then it was too late for cream. Used Acyclovir for several years, but not feeling tingling still often took it too late to avoid the breakout. Switched to oral  Famciclovir (1500mg x1) and it worked like a miracle for about 2 years. The last time by the time got my prescription from pharmacy it was too late to really work and it did not. Today I applied it at the very first feeling of it coming, and to no effect, half a day later still got my cold sore.",TheyStopWorkingEventually
9,Famciclovir,Cold Sores,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 20, 2019",4,I have used the famciclovir repeatedly for coldsores. I have had no side effects and they have stopped my cold sores every time. I am normally quite sensitive to a lot of drugs so I was pleasantly surprised. I am very susceptible to the cold sores spreading to my nose and eyes (Herpes Simplex) and I am terrified that this will happen so I always keep a packet at home and at work. I cannot recommend this highly enough.,Red
10,Famciclovir,Cold Sores,,,"August 21, 2019",5,"Famvir (famciclovir):If I get a cold sore, it means that 10 days later I break out all over my body with blisters. The condition is called Erythema Multiforme. It's extremely painful and serious episodes can mean a trip to the burn unit, since each blister is very similar to a burn.  Think of a match that burns you beneath the skin. I was diagnosed in 2004 and given large doses of Valtrex and/or Acyclovir to prevent cold sores. Unfortunately, I found these medicines almost worthless. I actually found high SPF lip balm to be more effective at preventing cold sores than these drugs. So in 2012, I gave up on any solution. I googled my condition for the first time in 3 years and learned Famvir cured 3 people with recurring Herpes Induced Erythema Multiforme. I just got meds today, but feel like I'm already rapidly improving. The jury is still out, but if you tried Abreva, Prednisone, Valtrex, or Acyclovir as to treat or prevent cold sores and they failed you, it may be wise to give Famvir a try.",M

I would have break outs quite often and sometimes so awful where I would have three or four at a time. I never heard of Famvir until recently and it has honestly been a life saver, I cant believe I have gone so long without it in my life. I took it for the first time when I had three huge cold sores and within one day of taking it they had reduced in size, swelling and were not painful anymore- they cleared up a lot quicker and easier than usual. I now take it at the first sign of a cold sore, and occasionally one has already started to develop, and within a couple of hours either it never develops or is dried up and barely noticeable and heals quickly. It is honestly a life saver!! I always have a pack on hand just in case now.",Anonymous

A couple of hours later when the pharmacy opened I bought Famiclovir. The coldsore is much less severe than usual, which would take over half my face, prevent me drinking, eating, and being so self conscious for a whole 2 weeks.

I started using the patches on my lip the next day hoping to slow it down, but nothing has worked - back to Zovirax now hoping this huge monster will disappear sooner rather than later!  I thought the tablets were going to be my saviour.. I am wondering if i should've applied the cream at the same time it took the tablets??",Morgs

I moved to SC and it got so bad doctors always thought it was shingles and by the time one was clearing the next would start as it would be a monthly thing with the southern sun.  Well the prescribed this as a deterrent and zovirax cream. Both were great, I didn't like taking it daily I had some mild side effects so switched to the 1500 mg at first sign and OMG changed my life.  Well the other changed my life also since it worked and I quit getting them but once or twice a year.  Now I take 3 pills at first sign and almost never actually have a cold sore break out.

That evening the itching got worse and the area (corner of my mouth, bottom lip) started getting red - I knew it was a coldsore. I took the 3 tablets before bed and was afraid it may have been too late. Thurs woke up with a slight headache, assumed it was the drugs fighting the outbreak. Fri & Sat, you could see a small blister, a little red, but wasn't getting much bigger. By Sunday afternoon it was disappearing and today (Monday morning) it's almost gone. Relief!

They caused me so much anxiety until I got prescribed this medication. I usually catch the cold sore when it is red and itchy because they often come when I'm asleep. I take the three tablets (costs me around $10 so very affordable) and during the day the cold sore continues to swell and throb as though the medication hasn't done anything. By the next day though I wake up to a dry red patch instead of the usual huge blistering process. This medication means the cold sore lasts maybe 3-4 days but is so much more manageable as it never processes through the disgusting stages. I always have a packet on me.,Sally1674
