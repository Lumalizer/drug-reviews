0,Acyclovir,Cold Sores,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2022",0,"I started getting cold sores about 6 years ago after drinking out a glass at work (that clearly hadn’t been washed properly). I get cold sores really bad, they are huge and make my lips swell. I have used every type of product on the market but it would take 3 weeks for them to go and it would leave a scar. I finally contacted my doctor after being fed up of getting them every few months. The doctor gave my a repeat prescription of Acyclovir to be taken on the onset of a cold sore 5 times a day for 5 days. Within one day my cold sore starts healing, without that painful bleeding stage. It’s so effective and really helps to reduce the impact on my life it previously had! Would highly recommend to anyone who struggles with large and frequent cold sores!",Super effective
1,Acyclovir,Cold Sores,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2022",0,Zovirax (acyclovir):I was disappointed the price you pay and the amount you get it did not last two days so I wont know just how good its meant to be because I could not do the recommended four days treatment. Therefore my hunt continues for a cold sore cream that will last and not disappoint as zovirax did,dissatisfied
2,Acyclovir,Cold Sores,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 27, 2021",0,"Acyclovir is a miracle drug. I developed cold sores that began inside my nose, never knowing what they were. Very painful. Eventually they spread (after blowing my nose during a cold) underneath the nose, then the top of the lip! Dr prescribed this and I take 400 mg 2x a day , it prevents them from forming. Now I start them when I feel that tingling begin under my nose. You must start them ASAP when you feel one coming on. One of the scientists who helped create this drug won a Nobel prize for it. There was no drug for this before. It’s a true godsend.",JDC
3,Acyclovir,Cold Sores,7.0,,"March 13, 2021",0,"I have taken acyclovir sporadically for the last two years. My blood cell count was low so I was forced to go off it for a number of months after beginning treatment. I resumed taking it two months ago and I must admit it has been very good. Before beginning acyclovir I had only 1-2 obs but almost constant nerve pain in the anal region. It had been like this (undiagnosed despite numerous doctor's visits) for around 17 years. After acyclovir began and then stopped because of blood cell count, it was however infinitely worse. I had permanent obs and permanent nerve pain in the anal region, and now I had permanent nerve pain in my vaginal area. my doctor originally prescribed me 400mg twice a day but I found I need to take it 3 times a day in order to quell the obs. I am hoping that in another 10-24 months it will be cured but I am suspending my belief as yet.",raglan
4,Acyclovir,Cold Sores,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 15, 2020",2,"Sitavig (acyclovir):I’ve been getting cold sores once-twice a year for the last 5 years. I do not get a small blister that turns my lip slightly red. When one emerges, it is so large and painful that one entire side of lip is completely swollen. It can be so unsightly and painful for those two weeks that I typically don’t leave the house. I’ve always taken Valtrex as quickly as possible upon feeling symptoms and haven’t found it to be effective. The Sitavig, however, has been a godsend. I applied it upon first notice of a small blister forming. The blister still appeared but is small enough that you can’t really see it unless you know what you’re looking for. There is no swelling and very, very little discomfort (slight itching). I’m only on day 2 of the sore and already it’s shrunk. Highly recommend for anyone who gets large, painful cold sores.",Simon
5,Acyclovir,Cold Sores,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 14, 2019",8,"Zovirax (acyclovir):I get coldsores mainly in the summer, my symptoms start of with dry and itchy lips, and then they start to blister and swell, I recommend if you have the same symptoms as me then put the Zovirax on as SOON AS POSSIBLE! The cold sore feels much better as soon as it’s on, the healing begins straight away, the blister on the mouth begins to dry out so it may feel uncomfortable, because of this I also use Carmex Lip Balm to keep my lips moisturised. I use Zovirax every time I get a cold sore and they heal much faster, for me it’s max 4 days. Amazing product and definietely worth the money!",doctorW
6,Acyclovir,Cold Sores,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2019",3,"Summary - If you get a cold sore, use Valacyclovir and Xerese ASAP and don't stop until it is gone!!!  Details - My nose (area between the two nostrils) started getting red Tuesday morning.   I just put Neosporin on it Tuesday night.I woke up Wed realizing it was a cold sore issue.  I was out of town and didn't have the cold sore meds with me.  I got Valacyclovir filled and immediately starting taking 2 pills in the AM and PM.  I then got Acyclovir cream filled (as Xerese was not available).  I used that cream almost every two hours.  It is very good, but not as optimal as Xerese.I kept taking both drugs all day Wed and Thursday, even though for Valacyclovir you can stop after 1 day.  I didn't want to chance it.I got home late Thursday from traveling and swapped out Acyclovir for Xerese.Results - AMAZING!  All I had was a very tiny scar on Friday afternoon.",BusinessTraveler
7,Acyclovir,Cold Sores,9.0,,"January 19, 2019",2,"Sitavig (acyclovir):This stuff is amazing! At first it was difficult to apply to gums (it is a tablet you stick on your gums and you don't swallow it). It say sto use round side to apply to gums but I found it easier to use flat side of tablet. If you catch it in time you just get a tiny bump and it goes down by the next day. I haven't had a bad blister in over a year. Use to get them 3 to 4 times a year. Now, maybe 2. If u don't have insurance this medication will be expensive unfortunately.",Jen
8,Acyclovir,Cold Sores,10.0,,"November 29, 2018",20,"Its no exaggeration that cold sores on my lips has in a way, been ruining my life. It has ended relationships, and I've learned to become ashamed. I had a boyfriend in high school who kissed me with one and now I get them several times a year, and in the winter its back to back. Its horrible. But this drug is a life saver. I wake up with mine, no tingles. I blast them instantly with 2 at a time ever few hours, and by the end of the night the blisters will cease. What took a week to two weeks to heal now only takes days, sometimes its not even noticeable at all. I now take this everyday to prevent outbreaks. This is a huge relief in my life. I recommend for anyone who suffers like me!",Lizz
9,Acyclovir,Cold Sores,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 30, 2018",15,"I'm a 35 year old female who has suffered from cold sores for so long I have pictures of me as a 3 year old with them, almost every year book picture, me with a cold sore. Every period, stressed, every Holiday. I was prescribed Acyclovir at 33 years old after giving birth to my first child. I had an outbreak and worried about my son catching the virus from me (Herpes is dangerous/deadly for infants) as my mother was so irresponsible when I caught it young. It's amazing, I remember thinking as a small child If given 3 wishes, one would be never get Cold sores again. I'd been on it and hadn't experienced one in almost 2 years. I'm very grateful l I'd never experienced ocular or genital herpes and have great sympathy for those who do. Acyclovir is a miracle for me",Hol
10,Acyclovir,Cold Sores,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 19, 2018",6,I use this drug for the occasional cold sore that I get on and/or around my mouth. I live in Mexico and found this drug over the counter. Super sad to hear the cream costs $200 !! Here a 5g tube and 50 tabs of 400 mg tablets cost me a whopping $7 USD. I have a few different tubes so I can have it available if I ever feel a tingle.  And since it’s so cheap if I see even a stranger with a cold sore I offer it to them. It is a miracle worker for me. If I am fortunate enough to catch it in time to take a pill it rarely goes to a full blister. And if it does it is contained to a very slight bump. For me it also relieves any discomfort.,Tammi

14,Acyclovir,Cold Sores,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2018",3,16 years ago I was accidentally poked in my eye. The following day my eye flared up  very inflamed and painful. I was diagnosed  with viral keratitis (cold sore virus in the eye).  About 5 years later they finally put me on zovirax  tablets 800mg. I found them great. Didn't take long for to clear it up  while also using zovirax  eye ointment  I have had less breakouts over the years compared to the 3 or 4 a year I had been experiencing before be I got prescribed this. These tablets were the answer to my prayers as it's extremely painful when I have an outbreak in my eyes. I currently have an outbreak and my doctor has me on 400mg five times a day as well as  the eye ointment. I've found with this medication the breakouts are less  frequent and the symptoms less severe. Also this  is free for me as it's cover by medical card which is great. No side effects. For me I would highly recommend  zovirax aka adviclor  to anyone  wanting to treat an outbreak,Little old me

16,Acyclovir,Cold Sores,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 23, 2017",8,"My experience is that I have had cold sores ONLY on my lips from age 6 to 35. I agreed to a 1st date...bam! I felt it. That is the key; take meds once 1st felt.I have no medical knowledge except I know what my body tolerates and what has been successful which may not be your best bet but be safe careful and consult you Dr b4 any treatment plan. 1. break up your pills in half for immediate absorbtion take 800mg every 2 hours to slam your system to alert it there's an issue and send in a 2nd round of 800 within 1st 4 hours2. continue 800 for 2 days every 4 hours3. apply Abreva or similar product on the sore at first sensation, while taking the meds so you are attacking the infection from inside (meds) and externally (creme on sore)4 days",FireFuad

I had a cold sore starting as the symptoms of viral bronchitis started so began taking the med yesterday (day 5 of cold) and took my first dose right at 24 hours ago. Im still very tired and feel a little feverish but my nose and chest are 90% better.

21,Acyclovir,Cold Sores,10.0,,"September 21, 2016",8,Sitavig (acyclovir):I have had about four cold sores a year throughout my teens and through my twenties. My dentist had a Sitavig poster in his office and gave me a prescription when I asked about it. I got a cold sore over 4th of July while at the beach and quickly applied Sitavig. I didn't have any issues with tablet in my gum and was still able to eat and drink throughout the day. Best part was I didn't get a blister and haven't had one since. Copay for two tablets was $35 which I thought was fair for two treatments.,Greg1245

It sticks on your gum which is weird and takes getting used to, but she told me it is supposed to make you have fewer outbreaks. Sure enough, I went 5 months before my next one. When I saw her next I did complain that it took long time to dissolve. She said that was part of what made it work so well. Not sure how, but I will never go back to using my valtrex.",Nick1983

I was told to take 2 a day for 3 months and then take a break and it dramatically improved my cold sores. They barely appeared but when they did they were half as big as usual and they healed within about 4 days.

25,Acyclovir,Cold Sores,,,"March 7, 2016",21,"Sitavig (acyclovir):I have used this product for a year. The biggest problem with this medication is finding a pharmacy that can get it. I have only had to order it twice. The first time was from one big pharmacy. When I went to get it refilled, they couldn't get it. I then found a local small town pharmacy. I was able to order it one time, tried to re-order it and they can no longer get it. I WILL find another place to buy it. This is the only thing that I can honestly say works. I have had 4 flare ups in a year. Only one time did it not take it away within a few hours. And, that is because I didn't catch it soon enough. It does work better when you use it as soon as you feel a cold sore coming on. I highly recommend this pill if you can get it. Use the coupon.",Bobbiejd

I rarely get BAD cold sores, but I just got hit with a really terrible one. Came on so fast I barely had time to take this pill in time. I've read that Acyclovir only works if you haven't blistered yet, which had already happened. IT STILL WORKED PRETTY WELL. It definitely changed how the cold sore is healing. It went straight from ""puffing"" up into a blister, to scabbing over. It also seems to be reducing the redness and swelling. I'm taking it 3x daily in conjunction with L-Lysine, and occasionally dabbing the cold sore with alcohol to dry it up. Overall, really happy with this medication.",Emma Ann

It was so painful the aberva didn't work any house hold remedies I tried failed. It got the point where I couldn't take it anymore I went to the doctor and got the acyclovir ointment ( and I did take the pills as well just because the level of pain I had was horrible and to make sure it wouldn't spread) but the ointment does work very well I put in on 4-6 times the day got the ointment and the pain went away and it started to scab the next day.

My only complaint is that it takes a LONG time to dissolve- over 12 hours. If you've ever had braces, it's nothing, but just annoying especially when you try to eat, brush your teeth, or drink water. I'd recommend doing it right before bed if at all possible. Unfortunately, I took it a couple days after I got a cold sore since it's a prescription and you can't see most doctors immediately. I will say, I can tell the healing process happened quicker with this medication. The above comment is false, as several insurance companies will cover the majority of the cost.
