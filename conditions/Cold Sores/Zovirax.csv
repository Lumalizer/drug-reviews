0,Zovirax,Cold Sores,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2022",0,I was disappointed the price you pay and the amount you get it did not last two days so I wont know just how good its meant to be because I could not do the recommended four days treatment. Therefore my hunt continues for a cold sore cream that will last and not disappoint as zovirax did,dissatisfied
1,Zovirax,Cold Sores,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 14, 2019",8,"I get coldsores mainly in the summer, my symptoms start of with dry and itchy lips, and then they start to blister and swell, I recommend if you have the same symptoms as me then put the Zovirax on as SOON AS POSSIBLE! The cold sore feels much better as soon as it’s on, the healing begins straight away, the blister on the mouth begins to dry out so it may feel uncomfortable, because of this I also use Carmex Lip Balm to keep my lips moisturised. I use Zovirax every time I get a cold sore and they heal much faster, for me it’s max 4 days. Amazing product and definietely worth the money!",doctorW
2,Zovirax,Cold Sores,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 9, 2018",17,"Took one ten day course of this anti-viral over seven years ago and have never had even a hint of another fever blister symptom ever since. I felt better after first week, and remarkably stronger after completing  the 10 day prescription . Next best thing to a cure.",Beloved  Salsa
