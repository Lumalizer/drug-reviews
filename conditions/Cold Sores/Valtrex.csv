0,Valtrex,Cold Sores,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 20, 2022",0,"Works everytime. I always keep 2grams valtrex so I can take at earliest sign of oncoming cold sores. If you take in time it sometimes stops the cold sores completely. It's all about the timing... For me I get a tingle in jawline, I take 2 grams right away. Then 2 grams when I get home or 12 hours later. That's it.. best thing other than a cure",Bust123

2,Valtrex,Cold Sores,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 19, 2021",0,"I am 20 years old and I have suffered from cold sores my entire life. I get between 2-3 breakouts every year regularly and it’s triggered by sickness and stress. In middle school I started using Abreva for relief but 4 years ago it stopped working altogether. Around that time I was prescribed my first dose of Valtrex and it is a lifesaver. When I feel tingling or blisters on my lip/chin, I immediately take my first dose and Valtrex freezes the progression. If the cold sore has already formed, it only stays for about a week on it, when previously my cold sores would last for weeks sometimes an entire month. If you frequently get cold sores like me, I would suggest getting Valtrex before you have a breakout. Since Valtrex freezes the progression of the outbreak, sooner is better, even a few hours makes a difference. I would 100% recommend because out of the 10+ times I have used it, it worked in shortening the time/severity of my cold sore outbreaks.",Anonymous 1
3,Valtrex,Cold Sores,10.0,,"July 4, 2021",2,"Recently had a breakout, I haven’t had one in almost two years. The last time I had one I went to urgent care and the doctor prescribed me Valtrex. I was a couple of days into the outbreak but saw a MAJOR difference it made in symptoms such as pain and swelling.This past Monday a bump appeared on my bottom lip and I took Valtrex. Anyone who has experienced these outbreaks know how painful and embarrassing they are. So of course my mind just went to a sad place. LUCKILY Valtrex kicked in right away! I didn’t have the awful swelling or pain! Only one blister came about and weeped. Got a scab on day three and it has basically gone now…the scab fell off last night. So what would have lasted 10 days cleared up in 7 and that’s probably only because I waited to take it rather than right away. Already got my prescription refilled. I’m so happy I was introduced to something that not only relieves symptoms but clears up these nasty breakouts quickly!",Rae
4,Valtrex,Cold Sores,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 15, 2021",5,"Hey guys, so back when I was 12 years old my uncle sexually abused me and gave me herpes hsv2. Being so young I had no idea what it was but knew it was for life which made me feel like completely awful about myself. Years later I am now 22 years old, I had a long passionate romantic relationship for 6 years and he never got it and would have unprotected sex every time never used a condom.  Fast forward we broke up I was depressed trying to find acceptance and love and so I hooked up with some guy on a drunk night and couple days later had a minor outbreak. WHICH MIND YOU never had an outbreak since my initial one when I was 12!!! Went to go get tested , found out I had both hsv 2 & 1. I just wish there was a cure for this , the inconvenience and depression that comes with it is truly traumatizing ...",Ashgaw

I take 2,000mg 2x a day 12hrs apart at first outbreak & it either completely goes away or only lasts a few days instead of 2 weeks. If you get it early at burning, tingling stage, you won't get one at all. Prior to Valtrex I was taking Famvir, but they didn't work for me. So glad my doctor prescribed this medication...

We both get them on our chins, cheeks, foreheads, nose, lips...you name it! They are very embarrassing and even more painful. They were all over my face, like multiple blisters when I went for my Pap smear years ago. When he saw them, my OBGYN gave me a prescription for once a day Valtrex. I took it daily for a year and didn’t get an outbreak for 3 years. Then, I had to start taking it daily again. After stopping for another year, I started getting them on my cheeks and mouth again. Taking 4 twice a day for one day at the first sight of one hasn’t been helping and another just comes back somewhere else, so I have obtained a 90 day prescription and plan on taking it daily for longer than a year for suppression.

14,Valtrex,Cold Sores,8.0,,"March 10, 2020",24,"51 year old healthy male. In my 30's and 40's, I would get the worst cold sores. I was prescribed Valtrex about 10 years ago as needed for outbreaks. The outbreaks lessened in recent years, to maybe 1-2 a year, and shorter/less painful. However, in the last 6 months I've started having recurrent outbreaks, about once every 4-6 weeks, age, stress most likely. My doctor started prescribing me valtrex daily. Today, I got up from bed and had a very small cold sore on the corner of my mouth. Very frustrated and took an additional 1g tablet to help, and thankfully, it hasn't become worse. Will see over time if it works on frequency. I will say, valtrex has helped shorten the duration (now just a few days compared to weeks before), lessen the severity and pain (now small, barely there ones). In rare occasions, I've been able to stop an outbreak before it occurs, but that's so hard to do. I am very empathetic to my fellow cold sore strugglers, and to me the best cold sore is NO cold sore at all.",runnerguyntx

On my lips, above my lips. This is also the first time I’ve experienced the horrible pain associated with oral herpes. It’s dry and feels scabby. I’m three days in, and actually went to urgent care because my mouth was swollen this morning. The doctor told me to take my 500mg Valtrex 3x a day.

I passed out during final exams because I had 18 fever blisters at once and I had gotten poisoned by it.  The doctor told me that people like me carry  herpes simplex type 2 virus in   nerve ending of our spine  and that when we are run down the immune system can't keep it under control and it comes out again. So that was a revelation.  Anyway, valtrex has been a life saver.  I tried everything as well - but nothing has ever come close to helping me until Valtrex.  Thank you!!",Beth

Valtrex keeps it from spreading; I never get any more blisters than on first onset. They also never crack or crust over. Within about 3 days they're completely gone.

I always wake up with several blisters that formed overnight. Anyway, I immediately take 2 grams of Valtrex (I always have it on hand! I get my prescription refilled immediately after I use it in prep for the next one). By mid afternoon, it’s stopped itching. I take 2 more grams before bed. The next morning it’s grown a little but not bad. 2 more grams that second morning. By the afternoon of the second day, the blisters are mostly gone and only slight scabs remain.

22,Valtrex,Cold Sores,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 22, 2019",8,"I have had cold sores since I was 3 or 4, but only in the past couple years have I seen an increase in the frequency (I used to get them 2 times a year, and now get them once or twice a month.) I was prescribed Valtrex two years ago to combat the cold sores. I take two pills at the earliest sign of a tingle. Sometimes, the tingle goes away and there is no cold sore. However, sometimes a cold sore still forms. There is initial swelling and fever blisters, but the blisters do not become enlarged and quickly scab over. At its most effective, Valtrex prevents cold sores from forming. At its least effective, Valtrex lessens the pain, improves the appearance, and shortens the cycle of my cold sores (from tingle to scab in 2 or 3 days).",olg

So people saying it stops it right in its track are wrong. But it does help for the healing time. In 5 days its gone. Still better then the 7-9 days i used to go through before. Can't wait till they find a real ''cure'' or at least something that kills the virus for real as soon as you take it.",Mary-Lise

I've always taken Lysine and that helps cut back on the length of time for healing when I just have one cold sore. This time, the swelling and pain of having multiple cold sores was just too much to handle. I phoned my dr. and explained that my top lip was so swollen and that eating and drink had become painful. Dr. called in a prescription of 2 a day Valtrex. I took the first one yesterday around noon, by 6 pm the swelling and pain had already gone down. This morning I woke up and while the blisters are still there, it's like it reversed all the sores. No pain or swelling. Just healing!!",Ibellah80

90,Valtrex,Cold Sores,10.0,,"March 11, 2014",48,Valtrex is truly the only cold sore medication that will act fast and diminish your pain and blisters within days You will start feeling relief in hours. No other cold sore medication can compete. The only downside is  you have to get a prescription for it. Depending on your insurance it could be fair to pricey. If you are like me and suffer from HSV 1 & 2  ask your doctor for 30-60 tablets. Most doctors will only prescribe the recommended dosage for treatment. (5 tablets) with 1 refill. It's such a pain having to go back to doctors when you have a simple outbreak. This will ensure a good supply for whenever you might need it.

A cold sore is a Virus (as I'm sure you all know by now) that injects its own foreign DNA into your cells which in turn mutates them which is why you get a cold sore - the way Valtrex works is by blocking the viruses ability to inject its own DNA into your cells.  So, if you take Valtrex at the FIRST sign of ""tingling"", you may never develop a cold sore. I on the other hand developed a sore this past Tuesday (took Valtrex too late), have been taking Valtrex every 12 hours since, and it is now Friday, my lip is fully deflated and scabbed.",Valtrex Supporter

Lysine helps prevent outbreaks and is for immune health. Has been working well for me and haven't had any real problems since first outbreak.",giftedgirl
139,Valtrex,Cold Sores,10.0,,"July 15, 2011",9,"I am 34 years old and have been a sufferer of cold sores from the age of 9 or 10.  I asked my doctor about treatment and she prescribed Valtrex for me in 2002.  When I get that tingling feeling in my lip I take a pill then take one exactly 12 hours later. I have not had a visible cold sore in nearly 10 years.  Valtrex is a little expensive, about $4.00 per pill, and I use about 15-20 pills per year.  As a long time user I would definitely recommend this medicine to anyone.",Anonymous
140,Valtrex,Cold Sores,10.0,,"June 5, 2011",7,"AMAZING. Valtrex 2 grams in the morning (first noticed) within 4 hours, they began drying up already. Took 2 more grams 12 hours from first dosage. Then for next 5 days, took 500mg twice daily. It was healed by 4th day. Literally amazing.  Brand Valtrex also-seems to work better than the generics, at least for me and am now on a suppressive to prevent outbreaks. ",Anonymous
141,Valtrex,Cold Sores,10.0,,"May 4, 2011",43,"Valtrex works wonders. As a 20 year old college student, exam time usually involves catching a cold and high stress, and the perfect formula for cold sores. Last night I started feeling one start to pop up around 8pm. I got home around 9:30pm and popped two 1 gram pills of Valtrex. At 9:30am today I got up and took two more. The cold sore did bubble up some but never got swollen, nasty and red. Its 5:30 pm now and its almost completely gone! Without the Valtrex, I would be sporting a disgusting throbbing blister for a couple days followed by a week of waiting for a scab to heal. I'll take the 24 hour cold sore over that any day. Please, if you suffer from these painful, embarrassing cold sores, try to get a prescription.",The Kaiser

I felt my bottom lip burning and itching this morning and ran home to use Abreva, then made a doctors appointment and was prescribed Valtrex one day treatment. It's been 5 hours my blisters are still there, but at least they don't seem like they're growing, still itching and uncomfortable though. I am supposed to see my boyfriend and his family this weekend so I'm really hoping it dissolves very soon.",lucylinn

It really works, it gets rid of all the swelling, redness, puss/scab; basically if you feel the tingling take it ASAP! It WILL help and relieve your mind thinking ""all I have is this Abreva!"" Well use both and it'll be gone no later than 4-5 days and that's a lot better than 1-2 weeks left untreated.",Anonymous

I woke up with tingling on my lip and knew exactly what it was, then 4 hours later another one appeared.  I immediately started putting Zovirax on my cold sores every 2 hours.  I woke up the next morning to find another one starting.  I knew that I couldn't handle 3 of these hideous things on my face and I had heard from a drug rep that Valtrex really worked.  But, she wasn't sure if it worked AFTER they had been present for a day or two.  I called my doctor and she prescribed Valtrex -36 hrs after they started.  I can honestly say that it worked.  In 3 days, there was nothing but a simple little red mark on my lips.",Anonymous

My lip swells to a grotesque size if not treated and I would literally shut myself in for 4-5 days and have one trusted friend (who would see my monstrosity) bring me groceries and take my kid to school and bring her back...I would cry whenever I saw myself in the mirror. This would happen about once a year.Then I took Valtrex....Once you feel a tingling, take two right away...then another two 6-8 hours later..then keep the pattern going for a few days after it's gone to ensure it won't come right back..use Abreva at the onset as well...and relax, sleep, and eat healthy...no smoking.

It was already starting to blister as well, so I took Valtrex, the first 4 pills at 1 pm, and it did not get any bigger all day. Around 11 pm I noticed it was so much better, even my boyfriend was shocked, then around 1 am, I took the last four pills, and the cold sore was almost fully gone the next day, the day after that it was totally gone.

I learned about Valtrex in school, but had not had a chance to try until I got an outbreak recently.  I had my doctor prescribe me 2g to take 12 hours apart as the herpes labialis prescription suggests and it worked wonders.  I got tingling on Tuesday, took medication on Wednesday (had small blister forming at time), and on Thursday it is a small healing scab.  Never got big enough for anyone to notice unless I pointed it out (which I did to everyone in my dental office because the healing was so great, they agreed).

By Tuesday evening however I was sure it was a cold sore and started putting Abreva on it.  By the time I woke up on Wednesday it was a full blown cold sore.
