1,Quetiapine,Tourette's Syndrome,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 30, 2019",2,"hi Ive been using quetiapine for 7 years now mainly for insomnia and tourettes syndrome. I started on 25mgs a night this worked great for quiet sometime then as with most treatments I had to increase the dose to 50 then 100 and sometimes 150. At times I would still be awake five -six hrs after taking this amount . The side effects I felt were extreme hunger uncontrollable eating increased insomnia, restless legs and twitching in the hands an feet,  irritability with extreme mood swings.  I  have never fallen asleep naturally since taking this med",teets
2,Quetiapine,Tourette's Syndrome,6.0,,"August 9, 2011",14,Seroquel (quetiapine):I am trying Seroquel for Tourette's and have noticed no difference. But my general level of anxiety has decreased and my sex drive is much higher! When I first started Seroquel my obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms became much worse but they are now better than they were before I started taking it. I feel more in the moment during the day.Bad part: I get goofy after I take it (I have to take it at night because it knocks me out) and I am having abdominal pains every day and mild diarrhea so I will have to stop taking it soon.I don't know if this is a side effect or not but at night when I am lying in bed I have started getting weird sensations in my hips and then my legs will kick out violently. This happens every minute or so until I fall asleep.,TwitchingRabbit
