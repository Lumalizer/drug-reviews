0,Olanzapine,Tourette's Syndrome,9,,"September 29, 2016",10,"Zyprexa (olanzapine):OK here goes. Never written a review about this stuff. I have been on Zyprexa for 20 years and still taking it. I'm 65 years old, and have had Tourette's my whole life (as you all have). Zyprexa has given me more relief than any drug I have ever tried, and I've tried them all to include the Horrible Haldol.I have 2 sons in their 40's and never any sign of Tourette's. I've just had my first grandchild, so I willl pay close attention to him. There has been a price to pay. In the 20 years I've taken Zyprexa I've gained 45 pounds. I don't like it much either, but never seriously tried to lose the weight if it is even possible. In the past couple of years, I've developed Type II diabetes or I should say ""pre-diabetic"".",05H-ditty-bopper
1,Olanzapine,Tourette's Syndrome,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 25, 2016",4,"This medicine did work to stop the facial tics completely, I feel better. The downside is the weight gain, my doctor said I shouldn't gain weight because I'm only on 2.5mg,but not true, I have gained 15 pounds in 2 months. I'm at odds on what to do, keeping taking to cure the tics or stop due to weight gain. I feel miserable gaining weight.",JessicaF
2,Olanzapine,Tourette's Syndrome,6,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 25, 2014",9,The first time I was prescribed Olanzapine I was on it for about 5-6 months. The tics were reduced by about half which was great for me. However I soon realized that there were subtle side effects which had horrible results. The medicine made me very hungry which meant I ate a lot more and as a result I gained around 20 pounds in a very short period of time. Another side effect was drowsiness and lethargy. I slept a lot and took naps during the day. I trialed the medicine again recently and the same side effects occurred so I have had to stop this medicine and try something else.,TourettesOCD
