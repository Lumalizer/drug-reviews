2,Haldol,Tourette's Syndrome,5,,"January 12, 2011",39,"The Haldol worked great for controlling my Tourette's, but it came with too many side effects so I had to switch.  I gained ten pounds in the first week of use which tapered off after around three weeks, but the restlessness was unbearable.  I was put on Cogentin for it but then my vision became blurry and could not see anything within eighteen inches.  It was horrible.",Red Light
