0,Topamax,Tourette's Syndrome,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 5, 2021",1,"Took 50mg (2 tablets/day) of topiramate/Topamax for 3 months for Tourette's Syndrome. It helped a bit for the first month, however it seemed to stop working about a month and a half in, however I held out some hope. Major side effects I experienced while on this drug were: Unusual tingling sensations in multiple different body parts and areas (1 week in); Severe vision changes (blurred vision [struggle to read road signs and words on a page even with my normal prescription glasses on] & Palinopsia [visual trails left behind by oftentimes moving objects‐- occurring both in light and dark] Which I'm pretty sure are permanent) (~1.5 months in); Severe depression (Never have experienced clinical depression symptoms in my life and now it was suddenly occurring out of the blue for weeks on end; only have experienced lifelong anxiety symptoms) (Month 2-3). Overall, Topamax made my vision worse, made me suddenly severely depressed for weeks on end with no reasoning.",SMV
1,Topamax,Tourette's Syndrome,5.0,,"April 17, 2019",16,"I had to stop Topamax, but I took this med for anxiety, Tourette’s and abuse of alcohol.  It was a great.  Stopped alcohol and Tourette’s disappeared.  I also had no anxiety.  However, I started to get hematurias (blood in my urine) and kidney stones from the drug and I had to stop taking it.",Anxiety and Tourette’s
2,Topamax,Tourette's Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 8, 2018",31,"My beautiful son had the worst issues with TS we went to a doctor, God bless Him I'll never forget you Dr. Marreo you changed our lives forever Topamax.   We tried everything...  my son is almost 90% tic free if not 99% most of the time. Yes, the thought process may be a little slower but the benefits outweigh.TRY TOPAMAX IF YOU HAVE TS it saved my son",Carmel Kaplan
3,Topamax,Tourette's Syndrome,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 2, 2018",14,"I've had Tourette's as long as I can remember. I was finally diagnosed in my 50s. Topamax was fantastic for my tics. First time ever to not be in pain. I have neck fusions from all the neck twisting, turning, stretching. Unfortunately side effects were terrible. Flu like symptoms, migraines (some take it for migraine prevention??), plugged ears, slower reflexes (not good since I do canyoneering). Good side effects: carbonated drinks taste terrible, lessened my appetite. I was on it for 8 months until I was setting up rigging for a 150' rappel and had to think way too hard on what normally was second nature.",Lyn
4,Topamax,Tourette's Syndrome,9.0,,"September 21, 2015",44,"Topamax/Topiramate has been wonderful for tic reduction. I have a fairly obvious case and they are exhausting and embarrassing. I have minimal to no side effects, a little drier mouth perhaps, plus my 15/20 vision reduces to 20/20. I feel less anxious and less ""pressure/need"" to tic. I can take much lower doses of the brand name to achieve the same effect with the generic; but my insurance won't cover the brand name. It's 100mg twice/day generic versus half that amount brand version. It's still worth it!! I feel so much more in control and ""almost normal"".",SBrun
5,Topamax,Tourette's Syndrome,7.0,,"April 10, 2013",41,"I have Tourette's Syndrome and ADHD. Tried different kinds of medicines for my TS. Depending on my day, I could have some to a lot of tics. Topamax did wonders for my tics, but it can have side effects that are similar to ADHD symptoms - different remembering some words/names when asked, unable to concentrate, etc. I also experienced that my thought-pattern were kind of limited to a certain degree, as I would sometimes have difficulties thinking further ahead. This medicine however, was much better than other kinds I've tried. ",SteffenG
6,Topamax,Tourette's Syndrome,8.0,,"January 12, 2009",31,"I have MS and often shake. I have a full time job and often had to listen to people ask me ""had a little to much coffee?"" or ""are you cold?"". Since I started taking two doses of Topamax - one in the morning and one in the evening my shaking has greatly diminished.",Anonymous
