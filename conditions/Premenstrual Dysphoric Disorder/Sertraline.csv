0,Sertraline,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 25, 2022",1,"Zoloft (sertraline):For a few years now I have been experiencing severe PMS. High irritability,  anxiety and mood swing. I am 42 years old and it started around 38 years of age. Around that time I also became a mom, so that was an added stressor. Coping became extremely difficult during PMS time.  I would have severe mood swings which caused me to have fights with family,  friends and co-workers.  I tried therapy but it was pretty useless. A doctor prescribed me zoloft  but I have always stayed away from pharmaceutical drugs because of the long list of side effects. I finally decided to take it as it was hurting my family life and my anger and anxiety were becoming unmanageable and the guilt would throw me into severe depression.  So far 4 months on the lowest dose, 25 mg, I haven't had what I call a ""psycholotic episode "", which usually means a severe outburst and mood swing. I haven't experienced any side effects thank goodness. I only had a lot of sweating in the start and that was it.",Queen
1,Sertraline,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 22, 2022",1,"I have been suffering from severe mood changes for the last 4 years with panic attacks and anxiety on a daily basis. A month ago I was prescribed Sertraline 25mg for the first month then 50mg ongoing after being diagnosed with PMDD and I have to say I feel like a totally different person. The moods have gone and so have the anxiety/panic attacks, I haven't had one single episode. I was like many people who avoided medication due to the stigma but I am so glad now I gave it a go.",Smith
2,Sertraline,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 27, 2022",2,"Was prescribed 25mg for PMDD. To say this is good is an understatement. It has been life changing.I was hoping this would take the edge off my rage but what it has done has completely improved so many facets of my life. It has enabled me to function extremely well.Pros: feelings of happiness, no longer disliking my own appearance, feeling productive, eager to socialise and exercise, anxiety is pretty much nonexistent, no longer melting down over sounds (mysphonia), sleeping soundly, things feel more comfortable and less sensory overload.Cons: nausea, sweating, brain fog (all gone within a week), ongoing jaw clenching and occasional gastrointestinal poop explosions. (Its not too bad honestly)In all, sertraline has been beyond what I had even hoped for and I’m really enjoying my life and my relationships with friends and family much more.",Naaaa

5,Sertraline,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 31, 2021",0,"I have suffered for 25 years with PMDD.  I was diagnosed 9 years ago and was put on fluoxetine, but did not find it helpful. It was too ‘numbing’. I recently started Sertraline & have seen very positive results - hardly any side effects, the first 48 hours a little nausea, a rushing sensation & teeth grinding. But since then I have felt calm, rational & clearer thinking. Even when I have felt a little bit of premenstrual annoyance, I have felt in control & more rational than ever before. I have spent years dreading / fearing my periods because of my behaviour, thoughts, sadness and issues with food around that time.But I have never felt so ‘normal’ as I do today. Every SSRI is different for different people, but this has worked very well for me. I take it just before I go to bed, so I don’t experience the peak during working hours etc. I also tested it while not at work to see how I responded - as I have had some awful reactions to anti depressants before.",HBBH
6,Sertraline,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 28, 2021",2,"I realized that my mood would plummet immediately after ovulation, and only get worse until the first day of my period. I started to worry when I started having suicidal thoughts. I started taking 50mg of sertraline and by the time my next cycle came around (only about 2 weeks after starting medication) it was a night and day difference. I used to look so forward to my period starting so my mood would lift, but my first period on sertraline actually came by surprise because I didn't even realize it was time. My husband said that he has noticed a huge difference in my mood leading up to my period. I was seriously losing half the month to pmdd despair and I feel like sertraline has given me that time back. The side effects starting out weren't too bad- loss of appetite for a few days, dry mouth, more frequent urination during the night (I take it right before bed). A month later those side effects are gone.",kristenk0709
7,Sertraline,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 28, 2021",1,"It took 3-4 months for it to mildly help with hormonal mood swings, but made me emotionally numb (similar to my experience on Prozac) which is always what I want to avoid with medication. I was told to take it in the mornings, but it made me sleepy and unable to focus on work. When I switched to taking it at night, falling asleep became near impossible. I had expectations that it would stabilize my mood swings (it did; by completely numbing them) but I was also hoping to have more motivation and energy to complete work from home, which was just not the case... I stopped taking it after getting the dose lowered to 50mg. Withdrawal symptoms came on day 5 and included brain zaps, lightheadedness, agitation and mood swings. Withdrawals only lasted for around a week after that, so not too bad.",G.E.
8,Sertraline,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 26, 2021",2,"I was taking the pill (lucette) to help manage my PMDD - it worked but also led to weight gain and after nearly 2 years I had enough.  I started on 25mg of sertraline and the side effects passed after a few days. I had some nausea, headaches and was clenching my teeth while sleeping.  Those were the only negative things - it has been great otherwise - I didn't need to increase my dose 25mg daily works fine for me.  I feel mentally lighter and very stable. Hope it can help others too.",123meds
9,Sertraline,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 18, 2021",5,"Finally after suffering from increasingly worsening PMDD symptoms over the past two years (I didn’t even know PMDD was a thing until the week before I got my medication) I researched and asked for Sertraline as a last resort as I was struggling to cope.The relief was almost immediate. Two days of headaches and a few days of nausea and a dry mouth were the only side effects I noticed. My mood lifted almost straight away and although I felt a little emotionless I also felt pretty normal again, something I had not felt in a long time.Coming up to my first period on the drug  and I normally get symptoms up to ten days beforehand, I have zero symptoms...maybe a coincidence and not a bad month but only time will tell but so far very impressed and I would encourage people to give it a try and not suffer in silence x",Coolcat
10,Sertraline,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 4, 2021",2,Zoloft (sertraline):Started off on 25mg. Noticed physical side effects but were easy to deal with. After a week I moved up to 50mg.  Anxiety spiked after I took it but I have been/am in therapy so I knew how to handle it. Did make it worse than before to the point where one night I had to try and put off a panic attack for an hour. Next night after taking it I got so suicidal. That was the last day I took it but it was still in my system. For the next 2 days I still felt it + considered crashing my car. Part of the reason I was put on this was suicidal thoughts + Zoloft made it SO much worse. Will never touch again unless it's to burn it. Almost everyone I've talked to who's been on it said it was the worst experience of their life. Congrats if you're apart of the 1% this pill actually works for. CNP told me out of 500 patients she's prescribed it to (she was biased since it worked for her) only 2-3 ended up feeling suicidal. Well she can now make that lie 3-4,hey girl
11,Sertraline,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 24, 2021",3,"I’ve struggled with PMDD for years now and I have tried everything holistically such as, acupuncture, vitamins, yoga etc, however the irritability and anger outburst were taking over and the overwhelming feeling a few days before period. Due to studying Psychology I was aware about the reduction in ALLO-GABA that was causing PMDD, after researching the life out of this medication it seemed promising. I have been taking the medication for 1 week now and the anger and irritability has gone. The first day was awful I was wiped out (drowsy), felt sick and headache so I reduced my dose to 25mg, by day 3 the side effects had reduced immensely. I have up the dose now to 50mg. So far so good!!",.
12,Sertraline,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,,"February 18, 2021",3,"First prescribed sertaline 100mg to take 1-2wks before period. The side effects were dire - I gave up. A year later PMS got so bad, recurring migraines/depression. I agreed to 50mg every day for 3 months. Side effects were awful the 1st 3 weeks. I slept all the time. I was sick and dizzy and moody. I FELT MUCH WORSE!! BUT I read reviews/youtubed and went on. For my first period on sertraline I had no PMS symptoms. 2nd period - no symptoms. 3rd - I had fatigue but I was due a review & increased dose, 100mg. I have no PMDD mood symptoms. I was in denial for years & although recommended treatment, I refused. Now in hindsight, I do regret not sticking with treatment sooner. Work through the side effects for a 1 month and ALWAYS take with food. I would recommend taking WITH a meal, from day 1 and continue that habit.  Give it a chance, it has turned my life around.",Newuser

I have been taking Sertraline for almost a month and I am so happy that I didn't give up on changing from my previous Escitalopram, Prozac, Citalopram. I suffer from PDD, then from PTD and anxiety. First two weeks were hard, but I started to have interest in activities again (week 4). Don't worry about weight gain, I was that's why I stopped Escitalopram, Zoloft does not make me feel ravenous at all. So glad",Luna
14,Sertraline,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 23, 2020",13,"Zoloft (sertraline):I had to share my experience because it has been awful. I’ve taken zoloft on and off for years for PMDD. While it did help regulate my moods, I’ve had the worst gastrointestinal issues ever since I was prescribed this drug. I finally put 2 and 2 together.I would be out shopping/at a football game/in my car driving and have to find a bathroom IMMEDIATELY. I would have a sudden and very intense urge to use the restroom. (Think Dumb & Dumber) It was so embarrassing. I would start sweating from the pain. Do you know how many unnecessary invasive tests I’ve had done trying to figure out why I can’t control my bowels and they whole time it was this drug?What good is regulating your moods if you feel like you’re going to poop your pants several times a month???",KC

16,Sertraline,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 29, 2020",7,"I have only just recently started taking this anti-depressant, sertraline. A week to be exact, and I cannot tell you what a difference it has made, I am sleeping really well, actually quite tired come the end of a day albeit early evening I'm ready to go to bed which isn't normal for me. So that seems to be the only downside right now, but otherwise, from being super sensitive, angry, emotional, cranky you name it, my mood has changed dramatically, to feeling elated, almost high *I don't take drugs either*, calm and composed. I have had a couple of anxious moments during this time where l would have previously freaked out, however in this case I was calm and passive, which even surprised me! So this may or may not work for all but if you do feel the good side effects with a little fatigue etc don't give up on them completely I believe they work.",ZimboK

But I was started out on 25mg of Zoloft following manic episodes after I quit birth control cold turkey. Zoloft made me feel worse than a zombie. Not only was it hard to even speak, it was hard to *think*. I felt very loopy and out of it all the time and it did nothing for my anxiety except make it slightly harder to think about, because thinking of anything felt like a feat. I went off of it and immediately felt better. I switched to Prozac and my doctors and I are trying to find the dose that’s right for me. Just pay attention to how you’re feeling and monitor things carefully, especially on SSRIs. Everyone has different and specific needs.",JeanieK

It worked superbly for my PMDD and anxiety, though it did exacerbate my depression quite a bit (irritability), which I fixed with adding Wellbutrin. All in all this combination really worked for me and gave me the chance to see life as worth living. I could never maintain a decent lifestyle before, and now I can.

The side effects are tiredness (too mellow and not hyper motivated) and weight gain but I can live with this instead of extreme mood changes prior to Zoloft.  It also helps me manage work and personal life better. It takes the edge off. My symptoms include racing obsessive  thoughts, anger, raging, paranoia primarily (general distrust of all human beings). I still get food cravings and some thoughts but they are dramatically reduced. I try to manage PMDD with diet, supplements (magnesium), yoga etc. Too.

Immediately after I felt nervous, anxious and just not like myself. 6 months later I started having daily panic attacks, then multiple panic attacks per day leading to social anxiety and agoraphobia. I tried celexa and it made me so fatigued. I started therapy (cbt), regular exercise and dieting. While this helped a little, I still had panic attacks and anxiety two weeks out of the month starting after my ovulation. I went on  for 6 years avoiding most public places and was a prisoner to my anxiety and panic disorder. I went to a female gyno and hormone specialist. She said that while the natural treatment and cbt was all helpful, that in her studies that Zoloft was by far the most affective. I started on 12.5 mg dose, moved to 25mg after 2 weeks and then 37.5mg. I now take 25 mg first 2 weeks of my cycle and 59 the second 2 weeks and my PMDD is gone!
