1,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 18, 2021",1,"THANKYOU! 10/10.I rarely give 10/10 for a product, but when it works, it works! Writing this on behalf of my wife who has had pre-menstural dysphoric disorder for almost 30 years (she is 47). It has gotten worse in the last few years as she also peri menopausal; it got to the point where there was almost no good side of the month for her. She was prescribed fluoxetine but she was reluctant to fill the script so it sat on our kitchen bench for 6 months. As she was suffering badly, I convinced her to give it a go. WOW! The dysphoria has all but disappeared and she is back to her happy self even in the 10 days leading up to her period. No bad side of the month anymore. Also, almost no side effects and within a few days it was obvious it was working. This drug is amazing and we are both very grateful to the inventor. Truly transforming",Chris
2,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 31, 2021",0,"Sarafem (fluoxetine):I went at least two decades struggling with two weeks +, per month being a ""different"" person. I always thought it was normal to have chaotic mood swings and suicidal ideation in the days leading up to your period. At times I felt so alone and confused, but above all I was absolutely miserable. All I can say about this drug is this: I have ""me"" back. It just makes life easier. In conjunction with psychotherapy, I feel alive. I can ""feel"" my feelings and not get so overwhelmed that I shut down. I choose my battles more wisely than before. I am more of a straight line than a mess of squiggles. It is my hope that everyone who struggles with PMDD, which I was formally diagnosed with only recently, gets the sense of relief I got when I started this medicine.",Sloane Elizabet

Within a month of starting fluoxetine my husband commented that I was ""more myself"" than I had been in years. I feared taking medication would turn me into a zombie, but instead it has helped me think through things more clearly, taken the edge off of my extreme mood swings, and helped me relax and enjoy my life. My only regret is that I did not start this medication sooner.",38yo Mom
4,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 8, 2021",12,"For PMDD, medical advice is to take this drug for only 14 days before your period, not all the time. I totally recommend this strategy for PMDD! After suffering severe depression and anxiety for 10 - 14 days before my period for years, I was amazed at how well this dosage strategy works - hardly any doctors have heard of it but when they looked it up agreed to prescribe it. It really changed my life as now I only experience minor irritation rather than crushing mood swings. Also I've had zero side effects and none at all when stopping taking it on the first day of the cycle. I've had SSRIs before and I know how bad it is coming off them, but this is completely different. Talk to your doctor about taking this two weeks on/ two weeks off for PMDD.",Bunshine
5,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,,"April 27, 2021",4,"I was diagnosed with PMDD a few months ago, but it's something I've struggled with for most of my life. I've taken zoloft before and it made me feel so nauseous and like a zombie. I thought prozac was going to do the same thing but it didn't at all. The first few weeks of taking it there were some mild side effects, like headache, fatigue, insomnia. I've been on it for about 7 weeks now and I have no more side effects. I take 20MG of Prozac for my general anxiety every day but need 40mg of Prozac for about 4 or 5 days a month to manage my PMDD symptoms. I feel so great, I never thought I would get here. It feels like a miracle, truly. I do notice the 40mg makes me a bit manic when I'm experiencing PMDD symptoms. I would way rather have mania than this crippling anxiety/depression. But for those 4-5days I'm way less inhibited which is not necessarily the greatest thing for every situation (mainly when I'm at work). But overall I'm very happy since I've started taking it. I feel so free.",ricearonii
6,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,1.0,,"April 9, 2021",18,"Prozac (fluoxetine):I have been prescribed Prozac 20mg for PMDD .  Guys coming off this med is worse than any PMDD/depression/anxiety and mood swings. Coming off means (PMDD+Depression+Anxiety Symptoms) x 1000 - I promise you. Just like you now, I ignored others' comments. However, most of the positive comments about Prozac is given by people who are on Prozac - but wait for the day they try to come off this meds. The reason people stay on this meds is because they cannot come off.  I found a good doctor, told her my story she did a blood test immediately; she found my iron, d3 levels and B12 close to none. That's what Prozac do to you - it depletes you of all your vitamins in your body and so when you tell your doctor they increase your dose instead of trying to correct your lack of vitamins which in turn lead to depression.",Dora
7,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 26, 2021",23,"Prozac (fluoxetine):I hesitantly started Prozac after trying lexapro and Zoloft. I found out I had PMDD and thought for sure nothing was going to help at this point and boy was I wrong. Prozac has given me my life back from intrusive thoughts, cyclical depression with PMDD and daily anxiety. I desperately wanted the old me back to how I was before I had PMDD and this is the best I’ve felt in 9 months. I would for sure recommend trying this (and sticking with it for the first couple weeks) to anyone with PMDD who feels lost and hopeless! I do take this in combination with birth control and am 6 weeks in. Keep pushing for a better tomorrow! ❤️",Anonymous
8,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,,"February 4, 2021",3,"I have always had bad PMS, and for the last few years the PMS started earlier and became worse. And I was, angry at EVERYTHING. ALL. THE. TIME. The death of my brother pushed me over the edge and the negative feelings/moods were constant. I could never stop thinking about all the bad things I've ever done in my life, telling myself I deserve to feel like this. My employer said it looked like I have a dark cloud above my head. I finally decided to try Prozac and I literally don't remember the last time I have felt this way, if ever.  This freedom from self-created demons seems like a long lost part of myself is finally able to surface again. I have a slight bit of insomnia (lasting maybe an hour in the middle of the night) and a slight tremor in my hands sometimes but I couldn't care less. This pill is amazing. I wish I started sooner. I'm on 20mg now, every day, I might eventually go down to 10mg and then I might eventually use it only for PPMD, but not yet.",T

Then my psychiatrist diagnosed dysthymia along side EUPD so I just thought I was for the knacker yard as nothing helped. My partner bless him started making a log of my moods and found that during ovulation and period arriving my symptoms of EUPD and depression were off the chart each month. After being exasperated at one of my appointments I was willing to try yet another medicine along came Prozac 20mg along side microgynon (contraceptive pill). It’s completely changed my life. I’m calmer, happier and generally feel cured. This came after years of trying different meds and concoctions. Please keep faith guys, you will eventually find your happy pill",Miss t

11,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 26, 2020",17,"I was so hesitant to try this. I really didn't want too. But the PMS symptoms were making me start to feel unstable. I workout, I try to keep a schedule, try to eat well. I finally reached out to my doctor and tried this. Within 2 days the symptoms subsided. I actually felt happy after a few days, on my period!!! Like I don't even remember the last time that happened. If it makes you more awake you can take it in the morning or sleepy take it at night. It's given me back those 2-3 weeks of exhaustive, draining, and everything in-between that I didn't even realize was related to my PMDD. Try this, you have nothing to lose. You only take it for a few days 7-10. I feel like I actually got to breathe, my husband forgot it was that time of the month. Do this for you. You deserve it.",Allicat
12,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,7.0,,"November 24, 2020",1,"I have been taking this medication for 33 days, after having the worst meltdown ever right before my period. I have had PMDD since I was 13 (21 now, so 8 years) and had tried fluoxetine in the past. I suffer with depression and anxiety, but I had never been depressed before menarche.This time around, I insisted I began with a low dosage of 5mg, and took that for two weeks until my luteal phase where I upped to 10. I took the 10mg for another two weeks and I'm planning to go back down to 5 then up to 10 etc.I have felt a lot less depressed, but have had headaches and panic attack onsets which sucks! I exercise and meditate daily so I can tell some others would really struggle with the increased anxiety. I hope the anxiety is an initial side effect that will go away, so I'll be monitoring it closely.I consider fluoxetine to be somewhat effective for treating my PMDD so far. I still get grumpy and sad, but not crying-myself-to-sleep-until-my-tearducts-are-bruised level sad.",Bridget
13,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 30, 2020",14,"Prozac (fluoxetine):I was diagnosed with PMDD by my OBGYN. I began taking Prozac 10mg cyclically. I would take it on day 14 of my cycle and then stop once I got my period. We did it this way because I only experience symptoms the week before my period. This medication changed my life! I no longer have the depression symptoms. However, after two months of taking it- I began experiencing heart palpitations. My doctor switched me to Zoloft 50mg where I experienced the same symptoms about 8 days into taking the medication daily. So, SSRI's just might not work for my body, But I definitely recommend Prozac to anyone!",Kat
14,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 11, 2020",8,"Fluoxetine is amazing for premenstrual dysphoric disorder! If tried citalopram& felt awful for a year on them so I was reluctant to try antidepressants again but I am so glad I tried fluoxetine, within a day I felt better. I have been taking them for over 3 months now and I think they work well for PMDD. I still have down days and feel tired and unmotivated when due on but I am not hysterical or full of rage like I used to be. I take them every day and I feel a lot better for it. It's not a cure for PMDD but it helps me manage it so much more. My PMDD was much worse after having a baby and fluoxetine has allowed me to feel happy againI sometimes get insomnia so I make sure to take them first thing in the morning to avoid it. If I take them on an empty stomach I can feel a bit gross too but I just take them with breakfast now. If I forget to take them I feel really rubbish pretty quickly so I recommend taking them at the same time every day. Give them time to work but they worked very well for me.",Dom

My doctor told me I could just take 10 mg a few days before I get my period instead of taking it every day. This was the first time in MONTHS (maybe years) that I didn't cry, feel depressed, overthink, feel anxious, nor feel irritable. My only side-effect was feeling a little bit jittery the first time I took it, but no big deal. It took me a very long time to get the courage to try an antidepressant for my PMDD, but I'm SO glad I did.",Maria S.

17,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,,"May 13, 2020",46,"After battling with bad PMDD for too many years and trying yoga, vitamins, YAZ etc, with only very limited results. I ended up trying Fluoxetine as a desperate last alternative. I was very nervous to try it as I had read there could be a lot of side effects and I was scared of them. I however have had no side effects and it has fixed my PMDD totally. I wish I had tried it years ago. Started at 10mg a day for 8 days then went to 20mg. It has been such a relief as I can operate as a 'normal' person the entire month. My head is clear and I remain my happy positive self even in the dreaded 48 hours before my monthly starts which was the worst time before. My husband is also very excited to see the change as he was very worried about me and what I was going through every month. If you have PMDD and are struggling I would say talk to your doctor as this just might be the closest thing to a cure you will find.",Dot
18,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 31, 2019",36,"Miraculous. It took about 3 months of taking fluoxetine 10mg ten days prior to the onset of my period to kick in, but it finally has. I had zero mood swings this month - in fact I felt GOOD before my period which has not occurred in twenty-two years or more. I still believe in the value of trying alternative methods to help in alleviating PMDD, but when you have exhausted all options this is a must! I will stay with this until the menopause and probably beyond. Why suffer? x",Lolly
19,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,1.0,,"November 26, 2019",20,"Well, I tried taking this in desperation after a very bad period. I took 20mg for three days and was hopeful about it after reading positive experiences here. However, my own experience with it was very bad. I got a whole bunch of the side effects and spent two nights not sleeping at all, marching up and down with very wired energy, having panic attacks. My mouth was so dry and I had to drink water all the time. It was pretty unbearable and frightening and, under the advice of the doctor, I stopped taking it immediately. The shock of all this, and my partner telling me they can't cope with me anymore, has pushed me to focus on getting my life really sorted out - meditation and going to the gym every day.  I will be talking to my doctor about trying a contraceptive pill as I read on the website that there is one called YAZ that is recommended for treating PMDD. Good luck to all you PMDD warriors out there! One way or another, we're going to get through this!!!!!!",hopestar
20,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 22, 2019",16,"After 3 ER visits in 3 months, I learned I had a severe reaction to a bc pill, the hormonal imbalance essentially giving me PMDD. Before this I was afraid of SSRIs (I had a bad reaction to Zoloft the month before) but I can say that fluoxetine has given me my life back. It took about 6 weeks (and my post pill amenorrhea ending with a heavy period) but the anxiety, depression, and dark thoughts slowly ebbed and then left altogether; I am only slightly anxious maybe 2 times a day and that is slowly but surely decreasing. This was done with a healthy diet, exercise, and supplements to help regulate my hormones. (The pill had caused a 35 lb weight gain, acne, extreme body odor). I am now on week 7 of fluoxetine and the difference is incomparable to where I was before I started. It takes time to build up in your system but stick with it and it will gradually get better!

When my doctor prescribed me Prozac she let me know that during the first two weeks I would likely feel uncomfortable , in my case it made me feel TERRIBLE. Three days in, I thought , omg I do not want to go through with this medication, but I couldn’t help but think maybe I will see some benefit if I just push through, I gave it 3 weeks, if I didn’t get better I was going to discontinue taking it. Sure enough, with 2 weeks I felt so great, I have never ever felt this way in my entire life. This medication has turned my life around.

This medicine didn't  make me in the clouds happy, but it takes the edge off and levels me out so that I can think clearly, reason normally and control my emotions and irritability.

However I feel as if I need to go up in strength after my husband asked if I was still on my meds. I however now also think I know why I got off of them before. I really do struggle with sex. I however know I need the meds. It really works for me and makes me feel better. If I'm not 100% I think it's really helped me to be back on it.

Felt like I was being a terrible monad wife, just felt so angry and grouchy.  Thank God my doc helped me by giving me prozac for the symptoms.  My irritability disappeared, and when she followed up with me I said, ""I can't believe how nice I am!"", which is kind of depressing in itself but it illustrates how terrible I felt before.  No more grouchiness with my poor kids.  I have been able to lower my dosage to 10 mg, starting 10 days before my period.  Feel so great, like a dark cloud has been lifted and I do not dread PMS anymore.  I am writing this to encourage other women out there to try this if you are having ""crazy days"" before your period!

35,Fluoxetine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 7, 2018",42,I wasn’t sure if I had PMDD or whether it was anxiety and depression being made worse by my hormones each month. I made a chart / diary going back four months and showed my doc. It was clear that most months my symptoms were happening a week leading up to my period and a few days during ovulation.My doctor wanted me to take 10-20mg but I’d read a study which said taking just 2mg had a good effect on PMDD. My doctor agreed it was a good idea to try this first and it has actually worked! It worked immediately which is another sign it’s PMDD. This month I didn’t even see my period coming. Usually I get very anxious and depressed but this month has been amazing. I take the liquid form so 2mg = 0.5ml. Apparently it helps regulate the Allo Pregnenolone steroid which comes from progesterone. I really hope things stay this good and my husband is VERY relieved too!
