0,Bupropion,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 23, 2017",27,"Went into Dr for menopausal symptoms thinking I would get prescribed hormone replacement (HRT) but instead the new thing is giving Wellbutrin for hot flashes and all the other negative symptoms of menopause (crankiness, fuzzy memory, weight gain) etc. I have only been on it for 2 days but I feel like it is starting to work. I feel like I have more energy and the hot flashes are not as frequent.",midwest130

2,Bupropion,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,8.0,,"October 25, 2013",21,"I am 40 years old, 123lb.  I was recently diagnosed with PMDD, I didn't want to try antidepressants before; I was prescribed with Paxil but never took a pill because my depression was only lasting a week to 10 days max.  I was having trouble falling asleep and have problems at work (perceived discrimination) those problems worsen depression during the Luteal face (12-15 days before period) I was sleeping only a few hours at night. My doctor prescribed Wellbutrin 150mg in the pharmacy they gave me buPROPion Ext. Rel. I felt the change in mood the fist day (great on this ares) and also noticed dry mouth and my sleeping problems worsen.  Medicine was prescribed only for use during  Luteal face, I am  afraid of what can happen after I stop.",FZ
3,Bupropion,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,8.0,,"April 14, 2009",34,"This treatment makes all the difference when I am in ""that"" time of the month. It definitely takes the edge of my stress. I wish I could take it for those 2 weeks only, but I have to take it continuously. I have been taking it for 4 years now and have no side effects. I am afraid I will have to take it for many years still. I wish it was not this expensive and that the insurance company would not ask for confirmation every year from by doctor that I still need to take it.",Anonymous
