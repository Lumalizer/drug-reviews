I tried this brand for the acne part, since I've seen dermatologists since I was 15 and nothing worked. Now almost 3 months into this brand, nothing has been done to clear my face, I sleep for entire days and am overcome with extreme tiredness. I get severe nausea and throw up at least 3 times a week, and I don't eat as much as I used to. I lost near 10 pounds in 2 months. A good thing was it stopped my painful period cramps and I haven't got a since period since taking the pill. A very slight increase in boob size, but still very tender breasts.",cristy
3,Yaz 28,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 27, 2022",0,"I’ve been on Yaz for 7 months now and started to take it for PMDD (trips to ER, suicidal thoughts etc). I have an underlying anxiety disorder but I can tell you Yaz has significantly improved my quality of life. Initially nervous about potential blood clots, the only initial side effects I noticed were headaches, heavy legs and bloating the first couple of weeks. 7 months later, I do not experience the extreme anxiety linked to my cycle anymore, and only get headaches while using the 4 sugar pills per month. The only long term side effects I noticed is water retention, slight increase in resting heart rate and fuller breast. I would highly recommend to give this medication a go if you are suffering from PMDD. It could change your life.",Girl88

I mainly got on Yaz for my PMDD and acne and have seen a significant improvement for both. My acne is practically nonexistent on my face now and I have very minor PMS symptoms. I saw many reviews saying weight gain can occur but I lost 20 lbs so far. I do have extreme cravings but have gotten pretty good at suppressing them and eating only in moderation. My breasts have grown probably a whole cup size and are extremely tender however. Despite that, Yaz was a great option for me and helped me significantly when antidepressants couldn’t.",julrbel

My PMDD made me near suicidal, crying a lot, etc. to the point where I would just isolate myself from others to hide it. I didn't notice any of those problems this first month on this pill. I didn't even bloat or have oily skin like I used to. The first few days were weird, just adjusting to a new med. I got headaches for a couple of days. I've had consistently weird dreams and issues sleeping while on Yaz. I've had more of an appetite, but that may just be from going to the gym more recently. I didn't notice any real weight gain. If weird dreams is the price to pay for this drug, its worth it. My mental health definitely in my control now. I hope this drug continues working.",macncheesequeen

I was very on and off about whether or not I wanted to try Yaz as I had heard good reviews but then very horrific ones about blood clots that scared me so bad. I went to the doctors twice in one week as I was having the worst panic attacks due to me thinking I would get a clot, however I tried again and the first 2 months I was quite short tempered and very tired and my skin also got worse, however I persisted and the only negatives now 4 months in is that I do tend to get tired more often and sensitive to sad things, along with a lower libido, butttt the pill has completely gotten rid of my PMS and I feel so much more level headed and calm. I also don’t get severe sugar cravings like I used to and have actually lost some weight, my skin is clear and periods are pretty much gone in 3 days! (Also no pregnancy;)",AMAZING!!!!

I started Yaz due to irregular periods and significant PMS symptoms. I take it with no breaks (no placebo pills) as per my Gynecologist and it has made a significant positive impact on my life. I had noticed that my mood is generally a lot stable during pregnancy and this is very similar since I do not ovulate. I'm happier, feel more even keeled and it has even increased my libido.

I'd come out of this period fog and feel fine and be confused about why everything felt so dire just days before.

I still have PMS to some degree but my mood is SO MUCH BETTER! I was really sceptic to take this at first because of all the negative experiences I read, but I gave it a try anyway.. I feel like I am myself again. I feel happier, am less anxious (which was severe), I can handle stressful situations better. My sex drive has gone up because I’m not always in pain or depressed anymore. I still need to take it longer to notice full effects, but the ones I’ve already noticed are life changing for me. I am so much more confident about myself. I don’t feel puffy anymore. No more swollen stomach. My acne is not gone (yet) but is a LOT better than it used to be. My wounds heal better. My skin looks more moisturised and clear. I have more energy,… the only downside is that I’m very tired in the morning. I will come back for update after 3 months of taking it",Fruitjuice

I only had mild anxiety on Nuva Ring and heard Yaz helped with PMDD. My PMDD was way better without taking these pills. I am also taking Venlafaxine for my anxiety and maybe the combination of the drospirenone and my dose was too much. I started getting cystic acne that I never got before.

I was on birth control from ages 14 until 27 when I started trying to get pregnant. After my son was born, I decided to stay off the pill and see how I felt. 1st year was ok, but then my periods became irregular and I started to have HORRIBLE mood swings. I would feel almost euphorically good for a week or so after my period ended and then live in 2 weeks of nightmare living. (irritability, depression, low energy)I started reading more about PMDD and decided to give this a try. The 1st 3 days I had really bad headaches. I have also experienced some nausea and also random increased anxiety which oddly always seems to happen after eating. Perhaps the anxiety is related to the nausea?Overall, my mood has been much more stable all month long. No highs, lows or angry outbursts.

Felt rather sad the last few days, been watching sad commercials and crying and feeling somewhat guilty so I was expecting this to be the start of my horrific PMDD setting in, only to find - I started my period today lol. My boobs are fuller (no complaints there at all, yay!), rather perplexed, having suffered from PMDD since I was 13 it feels like a total new experience, this must be how normal people felt getting their period?!

16,Yaz 28,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 10, 2021",0,"For many years I thought I had a weak immune system and was often sick. About a year ago, through journaling how I felt day by day of my cycle, I realised that there was a pattern and that I started feeling bad 10 days before my period, this gradually getting worse until the day before my periods. I self-diagnosed myself with PMDD, having all of the 11 symptoms inherent to it. Some medical advice includes eating healthy, doing sports, meditation… but I already did all of this. I figured out that mine must be quite strong and read about the combination pill. I had to tell my doctor about what PMDD was (which got all my girlfriends very angry). Luckily he was understanding and agreed that it was worth trying the pill. I’ve been taking it for a month now, and apart from a few discomforts (nausea the first week, spotting, sore breasts), I am so happy, relieved and grateful to say that my PMDD are completely gone now.

All of my symptoms have gone: the fatigue, nausea, difficulty concentrating, depression, anxiety, foggy-headedness, bloating, water retention, cravings, muscle aches and insomnia. I've been taking it continuously for four months and, although for the first few weeks I noticed some of the side effects mentioned on the leaflet, such as tearfulness and breast swelling (also, I was hornier than usual!), these went and left me feeling really good. I don't notice a single side effect now, and I have more consistent energy and happiness. Also, no weight gain to speak of: I just had some fluctuations in water retention during the first month, and my shape has slightly changed (a little less fat on my stomach/more on my hips), but it's not extreme and I feel good. I definitely recommend trying Yaz for PMDD, and I hope your experience is as good as mine!",Great for PMDD

It was destroying me and was extremely difficult and painful for my husband as well. I went on an antidepressant (Lexapro), which helped throughout the month, but was not powerful enough to prevent me from having crying spells and severe dips in mood around my period. I finally gave Yaz (a generic of it) a go. The first week was awful. It was like having a milder version of PMDD for 7 days. I had crying spells and low mood the entire week. Literally the day I was going to stop taking Yaz, I started feeling normal again, and have been feeling normal ever since. I feel emotionally strong and balanced again for the ENTIRE month, like I haven't in years. This little pill has given me my life back. Looking back at myself without Yaz makes me sad, but I have come out on the other side stronger and with more empathy. No one should have to go through the pain of PMDD.",lisssabel17

My forehead started breaking out too. I also developed restless leg syndrome, my stomach bloat is insane, and the closer I got to the placebo pills I felt constantly angry and ready to snap on everybody. It was starting to severely affect my moods and relationship. I also would feel very nauseated and just ill if I waited too long between meals, almost like when I was pregnant.

I didn't even want my boyfriend looking at or touching me. One mild acne flair up in the first few days but that went away pretty fast. I had nausea when I started was pretty bad for approx. 3 days then gone. So overall the only negative side effect I had was a severe loss of libido.

I tried to stop the citalopram to see what Loryna would do on its own and I had HORRIBLE withdrawal side effects.

Yaz was the solution for her. So, I tried it with hope it would work for me. Unfortunately, it didn’t help me. I believe it even made it worse, I had anxiety panics during the night which I rarely had before. Also, it really affected my libido and I never wanted to have sex with my bf. I was really feeling desperate and feeling that nothing would work for me until I tried antidepressant Citalopram. For me it was life changing, I take 10 mg every day and I have almost no more symptoms of PMDD, it has worked  really great for me.

I decided to quit Yaz, after my mood being greatly affected. I've always been an anxious person, but I believe this medication made me paranoid and extremely emotional. I would literally cry watching my toaster do its thing. My libido dropped off completely as well. This for me was a shame, since once the 3 month mark had arrived, I felt like everything had fallen into place: no acne, no mood swings, stability, weight was going down, etc. However, after month 5 everything shifted and my body just seemed to not like it anymore. I was SO paranoid. I was even sure someone had installed cameras in my apartment lol. Anyway, its a shame I couldn't continue in it, because it did help a lot with the acne and the hair, but those really are minor when you compare it to bot being able to leave your place.",Kikeyi25

The first few months were ok, however in month 6 of taking Yaz I essentially had a mental breakdown like I've never had before. Then in month 7 I had two breaks downs, two weeks apart. At that point I decided to quit taking my birth control altogether and see if it helped. It's been two months now since I haven't taken ANY birth control, and the difference to me is night and day. Only time will tell if I can truly attribute my breakdowns to Yaz, but I just feel so much more ""normal"" off of it.

Please understand that everyone will respond differently to any type of birth control. I had severe PMDD. I'm talking about suicidal thoughts and actions during the week of my period. When my period ended my PMDD symptoms would just disappear (this is different for any woman with PMDD). While on Nikki I have no PMDD symptoms I just had regular PMS. Be aware that this state can change from month to month because PMDD is very complex. There was no EXTREME amount of emotional instability for me. This is one of the reasons why I'm ranking it so high. My last birth control gave me acne and Nikki cleared that up for me within a month. My sex drive is perfectly fine as well. The only thing that I see as a draw back is that I've been having a few migraines with it.

No more panic attacks, heavy bleeding, bloating, and no more week long depression. It was great. For my acne however it really flared things up. I persisted through till 9 months of taking it. But decided the skin just wasn't improving so I gave up hope that it would. Since stopping my skin has cleared up beautifully. If you are similar to me, persevere for at least six months. But it may not work for you either. Keep looking for something that works for you.",Flik

I get anxiety of getting side affects like weight gain and depression as I have experienced them before on Levlin and Yasmin. Doc suggested Yaz due to its lower dose. I have had minimal side effects so far and feel pretty great on it. Except that I have been bleeding for the past 2 months on it sometimes its really light (spotting) and others not so much. I'm hoping that if I wait it out my periods will become more regular. After hearing so many negative comments about Yaz I asked my doc about the blood clots and she said that all pills increase the risk of blood clot and that its just because Yaz is a newer pill its getting more attention. Also you are at a much much higher risk of getting a blood clot if you are pregnant. Everyones hormones are different so if this pill works for you then great, if not then try another one.",l

So far I feel like my PMS symptoms have gotten worse. My breast were sore for the first month now they are fine. My hot flashes and mood swings before and during my period also seemed a lot worse . My depression has seemed to be more severe as well. But it is also the start of fall and I have more season depression . So with this being said . I don’t know if it’s the pill making it worse or just my normal season depression. I’m hoping My body just needs to adjust to the pill. I will give it the three months and update again.

I have always struggled with acne and my skin has cleared up significantly since being on this pill. I still get pimples here and there, but nothing like before. Weight gain was a big concern of mine, but I am happy to report that I have not gained weight from this pill. And a bonus is that my boobs have gotten a bit bigger too!

And while it took my period away (yet added spotting) and lowered some symptoms, it really only took away any predictability of my cycle. Instead of knowing exactly when to expect my downturn, I would wake up each day wondering if it would be a good day or a bad day filled with thoughts of suicide, nausea, & panic attacks. When my 4 packs of Nikki were done, I requested Gianvi. I've only been on it a week, but I've noticed significant improvement. My breasts are still VERY tender/swollen and my acne's still flaring, but I've actually been able to play with my daughter and enjoy it. I've been able to handle my high-anxiety dog without losing my mind. It's not perfect, but to not have the Jekyll/Hyde complex that is PMDD, even for just a week, has been amazing.

I had doctors recommend Prozac and large amounts of Ibuprofen...none of this helped.  It was by luck, my doctor was not available and I saw a different physician that prescribed Yaz.  I can honestly say this medicine has CHANGED MY LIFE.  I feel like a new person and spent 20 years in pain.

I took it for 2 years until Ocella came out as the generic form of Yasmin. I had no complaints and it helped regulate all my symptoms and made that time of the month more bearable for me. I could get out of bed and actually function the way I normally do. The only downside I had to taking this is I did develop Gallbladder disease and ended up having an emergency gallbladder removal.

My acne didn't go away, but it's not AS bad.  My ovaries aren't hurting nearly as much, I don't have anymore cramps, my mood swings are much more manageable, and my periods aren't all over the map anymore (the doctor actually laughed when I showed him the calendar I used to track it!)

Before I started taking it, I had reached a point where I just couldn't imagine living the rest of my life with the upheaval caused by PMDD.  While it doesn't take 100% of the symptoms away, it makes life livable again.  I had to stop taking it for a month, recently, because of a prescribing miscommunication, and I was reminded just how much it does help, and how much my quality of life declines without it.  The drawback, however, is the cost.  My insurance does not cover it, and the cost steadily increases.  It's an awful catch-22, to need something so badly in order to be able to fully live one's live, but to have to struggle to afford it.
