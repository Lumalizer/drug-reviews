1,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,1.0,,"April 9, 2021",18,"I have been prescribed Prozac 20mg for PMDD .  Guys coming off this med is worse than any PMDD/depression/anxiety and mood swings. Coming off means (PMDD+Depression+Anxiety Symptoms) x 1000 - I promise you. Just like you now, I ignored others' comments. However, most of the positive comments about Prozac is given by people who are on Prozac - but wait for the day they try to come off this meds. The reason people stay on this meds is because they cannot come off.  I found a good doctor, told her my story she did a blood test immediately; she found my iron, d3 levels and B12 close to none. That's what Prozac do to you - it depletes you of all your vitamins in your body and so when you tell your doctor they increase your dose instead of trying to correct your lack of vitamins which in turn lead to depression.",Dora
2,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 26, 2021",23,"I hesitantly started Prozac after trying lexapro and Zoloft. I found out I had PMDD and thought for sure nothing was going to help at this point and boy was I wrong. Prozac has given me my life back from intrusive thoughts, cyclical depression with PMDD and daily anxiety. I desperately wanted the old me back to how I was before I had PMDD and this is the best I’ve felt in 9 months. I would for sure recommend trying this (and sticking with it for the first couple weeks) to anyone with PMDD who feels lost and hopeless! I do take this in combination with birth control and am 6 weeks in. Keep pushing for a better tomorrow! ❤️",Anonymous
3,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 21, 2021",13,"Been diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder (eupd) for 4 years, tried countless meds and therapies. Then my psychiatrist diagnosed dysthymia along side EUPD so I just thought I was for the knacker yard as nothing helped. My partner bless him started making a log of my moods and found that during ovulation and period arriving my symptoms of EUPD and depression were off the chart each month. After being exasperated at one of my appointments I was willing to try yet another medicine along came Prozac 20mg along side microgynon (contraceptive pill). It’s completely changed my life. I’m calmer, happier and generally feel cured. This came after years of trying different meds and concoctions. Please keep faith guys, you will eventually find your happy pill",Miss t
4,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 17, 2020",2,Prozac worked well for me for a number of years. It helped my moods to the point I didn't even think about them anymore. I was functional ! Unfortunately it makes me extremely constipated so I'm not sure I'll be staying on it.,Holly
5,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 30, 2020",14,"I was diagnosed with PMDD by my OBGYN. I began taking Prozac 10mg cyclically. I would take it on day 14 of my cycle and then stop once I got my period. We did it this way because I only experience symptoms the week before my period. This medication changed my life! I no longer have the depression symptoms. However, after two months of taking it- I began experiencing heart palpitations. My doctor switched me to Zoloft 50mg where I experienced the same symptoms about 8 days into taking the medication daily. So, SSRI's just might not work for my body, But I definitely recommend Prozac to anyone!",Kat
6,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 11, 2019",69,"I have PMDD, OCD and anxiety. I have tried almost every single medication out there for years. I feel as if I was never going to be unchained from the torment I faced. When my doctor prescribed me Prozac she let me know that during the first two weeks I would likely feel uncomfortable , in my case it made me feel TERRIBLE. Three days in, I thought , omg I do not want to go through with this medication, but I couldn’t help but think maybe I will see some benefit if I just push through, I gave it 3 weeks, if I didn’t get better I was going to discontinue taking it. Sure enough, with 2 weeks I felt so great, I have never ever felt this way in my entire life. This medication has turned my life around. I’m only giving my own review, because every person is different and reacts differently to each medication but always be open about finding a medication that works for you!",Aibar22
7,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,4.0,,"March 4, 2019",22,"I'm 27 and I suffer severe PMDD, rage, mood swings, irritability, depression, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety. I decided one day, when I was PMSing severely; punching things, crying and breaking things, it was time to try meds. Long story short, I gave prozac a shot. It was great for a few months. I stopped crying, I was calm, anxiety has been to a minimum. Well it's been about 4 months and I'm now weaning off my meds because of the side effects. I can deal with excessive yawning, but now I am breaking out on my inner elbow, the back of my legs,  my ears and neck, my chest feels heavy. One day I had horrible pain in my chest and throat like I was having a heart attack. I have no allergies, I don't smoke, I eat healthy, I sleep well, etc. the meds stopped working, I suffered PMDD this month as if I wasn't even on medication. I  am going to look into herbs and natural remedies",Tot
8,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 30, 2018",25,"I have been on 20 mg of prozac for about 3 months now. It has really worked for me. I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore and overall feel more functional. I was very anti-psychiatric drugs before taking them myself but it has really worked in a way that nothing else has. I took 5-HTP, GABA and tryptophan before the prozac and these all helped a lot, but I still felt extremely depressed around my menstrual cycle. Prozac has stopped that. Side effects are that I get hot more easily, sometimes have nausea and trouble staying asleep through the whole night but they are completely worth it to me.",Lady
9,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,1.0,,"December 3, 2017",18,"After years of suffering I decided to try mess again for my PMDD.  Zoloft made me feel like a zombie and my body had many side effects to Prozac.  I had electric shocks in my brain, paranoia which I don't normally have, feeling out of it/forgetful, anxious, dry eyes, moody, thought people were plotting against me and my depression got worse.  On top of all that I went from being 5' 11 and 155 pounds to weighing 195lb in ONE month without changing my eating habits!!  My doc convinced me to give it some time for the med to work so stayed on it for  3 months-wish I quit sooner. I have now been off of it since Feb but still feel slight effects of the Prozac. Eventually Wellbutrin ended up helping me tremendously so I have stayed on that.",Susanlo
10,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 30, 2016",70,"I have been on 20mg daily Fluoxetine for past 3 years for PMDD. This definitely helps me feel more normal at that time of the month. No more crying, mood swings and feeling out of control for 7 days every month. It has taken me 20+ years to get diagnosed with PMDD after seeing lots of dr's who didn't really understand. In the end i kept a diary. For 2 weeks of each month i would be fine followed by around 10 days of feeling low, irritable, moody, anxious etc.  I did increase the dose to 40mg daily at one point but kept getting bruises on my thighs and itchy legs (side effect) so reduced it back to 20mg. I would definitely recommend this to anyone else suffering from PMDD.",CLR1975
11,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 5, 2015",70,"After suffering for some time with PMT I decided I couldn't continue the way I was as it was interfering with my personal life aswel as my work life. I spoke to my GP who offered me some different options, Prozac being one of them. At that point I felt I couldn't carry on the way I was so gave Prozac a try. I've been on it for around 6 weeks now and already feel 'normal' again. I don't feel anxious or hate myself. It seems to have cleared my thoughts. It's still early but it's definatly helped me get back to my old self.",Anonymous
12,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 30, 2015",18,"A renowned medication to help PMDD, but barely helped me. Helped with my anxiety and depression quite well (despite lack of emotion), but always got hormonal monthly, which was confusing. It actually made some symptoms worse. On Lexapro now, so hopefully that helps!",Danika2602
13,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 22, 2015",109,"Where do I begin....wow this medicine has really given me my life back! I truly felt like I was loosing my mind before I started taking this. I am in my late 30's, and for the past couple years I have tried several other medications for my severe mood swings (PMS). Being a mother of 3, with a husband, and working as a full time critical care nurse, I needed my life back!! My doctor said she had been going back to the ""old faithful"" Prozac for a lot of her patients. And boy am I glad I finally tried this one! I haven't had any of the crazy side effects I was scared of, and I feel calmer, happier, and not so socially awkward. I'm only on 20mg, but I feel wonderful with this.",Nurse76
14,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 2, 2015",103,"I am 22 and have been taking prozac for almost two months now. Before I started taking it, my life was a wreck. There were only two weeks out of every month when I felt semi-normal/happy. The rest of the time, I was miserable. I would lay in my bed and cry, thinking my life was ending for no reason. There was nothing bad happening in my life, but my mind would make me think everyone hated me and that I was disgusting. I was overemotional all the time and constantly to torturing myself with sad thoughts.I put off going to see a psychiatrist for so long because of the stigma. I regret it so much. Had I gone on this medication sooner, so many of my relationships could have been saved and I could have been truly enjoying my life.",Anonymous
15,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 7, 2014",32,"One week ago I started Prozac and side effects have been bad for me. Fatigue, headaches, body ache, forgetful, sleepy, nightmares, yawning. My Doc told me to give it another week. Hopefully everything will work out. I am tired of PMS.",zfly
16,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 12, 2013",38,"I absolutely loved Prozac. It helped me immensely! I noticed an extremely positive change in my mood and behavior after my body adjusted to the medication.Friends and family were surprised to hear that I was even on medication because of how relaxed and happy my disposition became. I'm happy I gave it a chance.I built my way up to 60 mg a day for almost a year. However, my body has become used to it over time and I'm having to change medications.",College Student
17,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 2, 2013",121,"Taking Prozac for Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder is a miracle! But when I hit forty it really got worse.. especially at period time, my thoughts were so messed up, I would think things that I knew wasn't normal and cry because of the most ridiculous reasons or just non- stop crying for no reason. Irritated beyond expression and like my body was on speed. But all out of my control, I could not get in control of my moods or thoughts. So last year at my Gyno appointment I mentioned this bizarre experience I would have prior to my periods!She explains PDD and prescribed Prozac. I take mine 14 days prior and every other day or every third day because it makes me feel draggy! Just depends how it affects me that month. I take it before I go to bed. Works great! New life!",Danephew

19,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,,"April 19, 2009",93,"I have used Prozac for premenstrual dysphoric disorder, anxiety, panic disorder and depression and it has helped a lot.  When I first started the drug, I lost 25 lbs, I think due to the fact that I felt better. My panic attacks were gone and I could actually feel the drug calming me down.  Prozac got rid of my PMS and PMDD completely. With Prozac I can even think more clearly and I am more alert and think quickly in stressful situations, instead of being stressed out and in a panic. The only side effects are that after I went back to the drug after being off of it for a while, the weight loss stopped and I had to watch that I did not gain weight.  Also, the sexual side effects, but aphrodisiacs help a lot.",ebrown09
20,Prozac,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,,"October 30, 2008",93,"After about 3 months or so, all of the side effects that I was having disappeared.  It works great for my PMS, anxiety and even helps me to think clearer (ADD).  Just be patient.  One thing that I don't like is the weight gain, but plump and happy is better than thin and cranky.",Anonymous
