0,Venlafaxine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 5, 2020",4,"I had been on 200mg Sertraline for 10 years, took Covid in March and from May felt like my medication wasn't helping my anxiety/depression anymore then by June my PMDD was back in full swing and I was suicidal. Weaning from Sertraline to Venlafaxine was difficult BUT at the moment it has changed my life after being on it for 3 months.  I am no longer tired, I have an underactive thyroid and always thought that was the reason I was tired! Venlafaxine has made me feel more balanced than I have in years.",CC

2,Venlafaxine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 10, 2013",46,"Effexor (venlafaxine):I been suffering from Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder for a few years now and have tried everything under the sun, but with the Effexor I am feeling great. It does have some side effects though, but lasted for a few days, but now gone. They include the following: Jitters, drowsiness, and a touch of nausea.  Although with the sadness and anxiety under control I now realize all the physical symptoms of PMDD. I rather have the physical symptoms over the emotions any day.",CreativeMandy.
3,Venlafaxine,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9,,"June 22, 2011",43,"Effexor XR (venlafaxine):Works great for my PMDD, but I experience excessive sweating and the yawns.  Worth it, though. Slightly better than the SSRIs (Zoloft, Proxac) I've taken for the anxiety/irritability piece.",Anonymous
