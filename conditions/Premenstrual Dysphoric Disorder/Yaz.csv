1,Yaz,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 9, 2022",1,"I was honestly terrified reading the reviews before talking to my Dr about Yaz but we came to the conclusion that this is the best possible option for me. I mainly got on Yaz for my PMDD and acne and have seen a significant improvement for both. My acne is practically nonexistent on my face now and I have very minor PMS symptoms. I saw many reviews saying weight gain can occur but I lost 20 lbs so far. I do have extreme cravings but have gotten pretty good at suppressing them and eating only in moderation. My breasts have grown probably a whole cup size and are extremely tender however. Despite that, Yaz was a great option for me and helped me significantly when antidepressants couldn’t.",julrbel
2,Yaz,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 8, 2022",0,"I've only taken it for a month so far, but I do notice a positive effect. My PMDD made me near suicidal, crying a lot, etc. to the point where I would just isolate myself from others to hide it. I didn't notice any of those problems this first month on this pill. I didn't even bloat or have oily skin like I used to. The first few days were weird, just adjusting to a new med. I got headaches for a couple of days. I've had consistently weird dreams and issues sleeping while on Yaz. I've had more of an appetite, but that may just be from going to the gym more recently. I didn't notice any real weight gain. If weird dreams is the price to pay for this drug, its worth it. My mental health definitely in my control now. I hope this drug continues working.",macncheesequeen

I was very on and off about whether or not I wanted to try Yaz as I had heard good reviews but then very horrific ones about blood clots that scared me so bad. I went to the doctors twice in one week as I was having the worst panic attacks due to me thinking I would get a clot, however I tried again and the first 2 months I was quite short tempered and very tired and my skin also got worse, however I persisted and the only negatives now 4 months in is that I do tend to get tired more often and sensitive to sad things, along with a lower libido, butttt the pill has completely gotten rid of my PMS and I feel so much more level headed and calm. I also don’t get severe sugar cravings like I used to and have actually lost some weight, my skin is clear and periods are pretty much gone in 3 days! (Also no pregnancy;)",AMAZING!!!!

I started Yaz due to irregular periods and significant PMS symptoms. I take it with no breaks (no placebo pills) as per my Gynecologist and it has made a significant positive impact on my life. I had noticed that my mood is generally a lot stable during pregnancy and this is very similar since I do not ovulate. I'm happier, feel more even keeled and it has even increased my libido. I haven't noticed any side effects and my weight has been stable (I'm on the 3rd pack currently).",tiger2022

My period was non existent for the time on Mirena so I only had my teenage years of periods to compare and suddenly as a 32 year old I was experiencing similar emotional/mental troubles as I had when I was a kid. Irrational thoughts, depression, anxiety, mood swings, crying constantly for no reason, hopelessness. I'd come out of this period fog and feel fine and be confused about why everything felt so dire just days before. My Dr started me on Yaz 2 months ago and my H cup breasts have gotten so big that none of my bras fit anymore (as if I needed them to be bigger?!) I have acne that won't clear, I've been bleeding in between periods along with uterine & vaginal pain, my sex drive is dead, hasn't made a difference in my PMDD.

I got a terrible headache and then couldn't sleep at all until 3am. I stopped taking the pill and the day after I still had a headache. My mood went down really bad and anxiety came back. I only had mild anxiety on Nuva Ring and heard Yaz helped with PMDD. My PMDD was way better without taking these pills. I am also taking Venlafaxine for my anxiety and maybe the combination of the drospirenone and my dose was too much. I started getting cystic acne that I never got before. My face was pretty clear with a tiny pimple or two. On this for only 4 days and I woke up with acne marks that hurt so bad.

It started when I was 28. I've never had menstrual pain that intense as well.Yaz helped me a lot - no more mood swings, I don't cry anymore and I don't have any menstrual pain and breast pain. It also helped me to recover from depression I've experienced for the past 2 years (I started feeling better after therapy and thanks to tranquilizers, but Yaz helped me to adjust after I cancelled my meds).I don't need painkillers anymore during my period.I haven't gained weight and my skin is the same as it was before, but I have 2 side effects as well.First, I almost lost my libido.

Started my period today and scratching my head as I've got barely any stomach cramps/ no back pain/ migraines in the week leading up to it so I'm rather confused. Felt rather sad the last few days, been watching sad commercials and crying and feeling somewhat guilty so I was expecting this to be the start of my horrific PMDD setting in, only to find - I started my period today lol. My boobs are fuller (no complaints there at all, yay!), rather perplexed, having suffered from PMDD since I was 13 it feels like a total new experience, this must be how normal people felt getting their period?! I was going to go for the coil but I wanted to go for a less invasive procedure first, wow. All I can say is wow and I hope this continues to work for me, I really recommend at least giving this a go!!",perplexedlol
9,Yaz,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 13, 2021",2,"I've had a v positive experience with Yaz (Eloine in the UK) which has completely cleared up my previously debilitating PMDD. All of my symptoms have gone: the fatigue, nausea, difficulty concentrating, depression, anxiety, foggy-headedness, bloating, water retention, cravings, muscle aches and insomnia. I've been taking it continuously for four months and, although for the first few weeks I noticed some of the side effects mentioned on the leaflet, such as tearfulness and breast swelling (also, I was hornier than usual!), these went and left me feeling really good. I don't notice a single side effect now, and I have more consistent energy and happiness. Also, no weight gain to speak of: I just had some fluctuations in water retention during the first month, and my shape has slightly changed (a little less fat on my stomach/more on my hips), but it's not extreme and I feel good. I definitely recommend trying Yaz for PMDD, and I hope your experience is as good as mine!",Great for PMDD

It was destroying me and was extremely difficult and painful for my husband as well. I went on an antidepressant (Lexapro), which helped throughout the month, but was not powerful enough to prevent me from having crying spells and severe dips in mood around my period. I finally gave Yaz (a generic of it) a go. The first week was awful. It was like having a milder version of PMDD for 7 days. I had crying spells and low mood the entire week. Literally the day I was going to stop taking Yaz, I started feeling normal again, and have been feeling normal ever since. I feel emotionally strong and balanced again for the ENTIRE month, like I haven't in years. This little pill has given me my life back. Looking back at myself without Yaz makes me sad, but I have come out on the other side stronger and with more empathy. No one should have to go through the pain of PMDD.",lisssabel17

13,Yaz,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 2, 2021",3,"It’s been 2 to 3 years since I have PMDD. I had terrible anxiety, crying spells, I felt rejected and I had insomnia every month and never really realize it was PMDD, but about 6 months ago, I talked to my mom about it and she told me it was probably PMDD, because she had the same thing. Yaz was the solution for her. So, I tried it with hope it would work for me. Unfortunately, it didn’t help me. I believe it even made it worse, I had anxiety panics during the night which I rarely had before. Also, it really affected my libido and I never wanted to have sex with my bf. I was really feeling desperate and feeling that nothing would work for me until I tried antidepressant Citalopram. For me it was life changing, I take 10 mg every day and I have almost no more symptoms of PMDD, it has worked  really great for me. So, I would say, try Yaz first, because it worked for my mom and it worked for a lot of women and if it doesn’t work, try citalopram! It is really life changing for me:)",emmast

I wish PMDD was a more commonly known thing it so easily it gets brushed off as PMS or moodiness as I did for about a year. I didn't know it existed until a few months ago hence not looking for a cure. I think I'll take this forever the improvement is unbelievable PMDD is all but gone.

I called 999 and they took me to hospital. I’m still in the hospital right now because they have found a blood clot. The doctor told me it was because of Yaz. I’m absolutely petrified.

I decided to quit Yaz, after my mood being greatly affected. I've always been an anxious person, but I believe this medication made me paranoid and extremely emotional. I would literally cry watching my toaster do its thing. My libido dropped off completely as well. This for me was a shame, since once the 3 month mark had arrived, I felt like everything had fallen into place: no acne, no mood swings, stability, weight was going down, etc. However, after month 5 everything shifted and my body just seemed to not like it anymore. I was SO paranoid. I was even sure someone had installed cameras in my apartment lol. Anyway, its a shame I couldn't continue in it, because it did help a lot with the acne and the hair, but those really are minor when you compare it to bot being able to leave your place.",Kikeyi25

At first I was excited because my doctor had also told me that I probably have PMDD, and Yaz is supposed to help with that (as well as my hormonal acne flair ups). The first few months were ok, however in month 6 of taking Yaz I essentially had a mental breakdown like I've never had before. Then in month 7 I had two breaks downs, two weeks apart. At that point I decided to quit taking my birth control altogether and see if it helped. It's been two months now since I haven't taken ANY birth control, and the difference to me is night and day. Only time will tell if I can truly attribute my breakdowns to Yaz, but I just feel so much more ""normal"" off of it. My anxiety has gone down, I don't feel so depressed/suicidal and I feel more social. I'm hoping I can eventually find a method that will finally work for me.",Takingabreak

I had lots of failed relationships I was bat crazy. I eventually got a new doctor who gave me Yaz again and things changed. I fell pregnant twice on Yaz and have two beautiful boys after that they refused to give it to me so roll on another 10 years of trying everything. My husband even had the snip so I didn’t have to take anything. I was watching the TV  a year and a half ago and they were talking about PMDD as a disorder and I said OMG that is me. Lots of research and I eventually got Yaz again. Didn’t want to give it as I was obese and over 35 but begged.

The first year, I took about 5 months to fully transition onto. I was taking it because I had bad acne and and the pain with my periods were crazy! I briefly stopped Yaz after a year, as I started having a bit of spotting in the middle of my packs, so I tried Yasmin for a couple month which I absolutely did not suit me! My breasts hurt so bad, even when I was just walking. I went back on Yaz just over a year ago and I've never been happier. I feel normal I feel like everything is under control. My gynaecologist advised me maybe my body just needed a break for it to come back and continue to be effective. As of now, I have a period every 2-3 months, as I ""skip"" my periods as my gynaecologist advised and my skin has been amazing, the pain is hardly there and I've never been happier.

Next days I started getting stomach issues: diarrhea, bloating, migraine. I stayed on it and tried to be patient. Was taking ibuprofen daily to get on.  I'm as of today on the sugar pills and I had my period for at least 10 days. I really think it made a difference with my cystic acne. I just got one cyst this month. However, my back got full of small flesh colored pimples I had never had and also I got them on my chest. I am open to take two more months of it.

I am way less moody and irritable, less anxious, less fatigued, don’t get massive food cravings and hunger spells, feel the cold less (I used to always be cold), am more clear headed, and experience less negative emotions, such as hostility and jealousy. An initial downside for me was that my boobs went up a size. I really liked my small non-painful boobs. However, I’m learning to love my new size and after finally buying some new bras I am content.

30,Yaz,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,8.0,,"January 29, 2020",83,"I’m here to leave a positive review, because all of the negative reviews might scare people from trying this birth control. I tried 5 other pills, the ring, and an IUD, and  out of all of these the Yaz has had the least side effects. It helps keep my skin a little clearer, I actually lost weight while on it, and it helped my PMDD (which for me was inconsolable sadness and rage). It didn’t make it go away, but it absolutely took the edge off. I used to have 2.5 weeks of PMDD symptoms, now I just get kinda sad for 2 days before my period.  The only reason I’m not rating it 10 is because I think it makes me a little more emotional/sentimental (crying at videos of kittens, which I did) but I’d rather be weepy over cute animals than raging out on my loved ones.  I recently switched to another method, and switched right back to Yaz without finishing the month. Every body is totally different.  I’m in my 30’s with PMDD and acne, and Yaz helps.

I have had minimal side effects so far and feel pretty great on it. Except that I have been bleeding for the past 2 months on it sometimes its really light (spotting) and others not so much. I'm hoping that if I wait it out my periods will become more regular. After hearing so many negative comments about Yaz I asked my doc about the blood clots and she said that all pills increase the risk of blood clot and that its just because Yaz is a newer pill its getting more attention. Also you are at a much much higher risk of getting a blood clot if you are pregnant. Everyones hormones are different so if this pill works for you then great, if not then try another one.",l

My periods were becoming irregular (for example, coming before I had begun the sugar pills) and I also started suffering from severe headaches everyday.

I don’t want to kill anyone anymore, I’m not fatigued to the point where I can’t get out of bed, my joints don’t hurt, I’m not depressed, and I don’t have to miss work. My skin isn’t amazingly clear but has cleared up some and my breast are much fuller now which is fine with me because they were starting to become flat anyway.

However, this being said, after only a week on Yaz, I began noticing drastic improvements in mood. I was suppose to be suffering from PMS/PMDD this past week as my period starts next week, and for the first two days I was definitely an emotional wreck, but the following days, I noticed the horrible depression and anxiety I normally get for two weeks out of the month just suddenly lifted. I’m  I am also experiencing very little nausea with Yaz in comparison to other BCs I’ve taken, and the appetite increase I usually feel around this time also disappeared. I’m pretty happy so far, I’m hoping it will help with my cystic acne and that any other symptoms won’t be too severe.",Madz

Only one week per month I would live normal without my menstrual cycle affecting me. Since I started taking Yaz, I'm reborn. First month I had side effects like sore breasts and bigger appetite, but after first month or two everything regulated and I'm feeling better than ever!

I missed 6 weeks of school, almost didn’t pass 11th grade, and suicide became a very tangible idea. The next years of life were blurry, and involved lots of doctors to find out what was wrong. They suggested antidepressants because they thought Yaz—a drug to treat PMDD—actually CREATED it in me. The truth is, while I’m generally a happy and positive person now, I’ve never felt mentally as sane as I did in 2006, and I believe Yaz is 100% responsible.

On Tri-cyclen, my period was light, but it never stopped, for 3 months! On Demulen I went into a deep depression that I am still getting over. And finally, on Aviane, it was great, but I gained about 40 lbs in the past year. I went on Yaz to help keep me upbeat and happy (coupled with my daily dose of Prozac), and to hopefully help me shed some weight and give me comfortable and short periods. So far, so good.

Before I started taking it, I had reached a point where I just couldn't imagine living the rest of my life with the upheaval caused by PMDD.  While it doesn't take 100% of the symptoms away, it makes life livable again.  I had to stop taking it for a month, recently, because of a prescribing miscommunication, and I was reminded just how much it does help, and how much my quality of life declines without it.  The drawback, however, is the cost.  My insurance does not cover it, and the cost steadily increases.
