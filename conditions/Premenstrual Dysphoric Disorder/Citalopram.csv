0,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 14, 2021",6,"Only been taking 10mg for the last 2 weeks of my cycle and this is my first cycle since started . Absolutely made up with it . I've gone from being a paranoid , angry,  irritable , emotional person who felt the world was against her  those last 2 weeks of my cycle  to feeling so happy and normal how I am before  those two weeks . I usually feel the change happening and find it so uncontrollable I must be so sensitive to the hormone changes but now nothing and I am so grateful for how it's worked for me . My partner was at the end of his tether with me as he usually got the brunt of it and said I have been absolutely fine with them . My kids I'm sure can tell too . I didn't really have any side effects , other than dry mouth but that only lasted a few days .",Anonymous
1,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,,"April 14, 2021",3,"I developed postpartum anxiety after my second child and tried Zoloft when he was 8 months old. That did nothing so I stopped. Then I started noticing PMDD symptoms. I was anxious, depressed, so filled with rage and anger that I would completely lose it at anyone over hardly a thing. Then my period would come and I would be back to my normal self. Each month it started getting worse and I couldn't put myself or my family through it again as I was really worried how bad my symptoms would get the next month and thought I might hurt myself or someone else. I started researching and classic PMDD I then thought and realised I've had it since I was a teenager. Saw my GP started on citalopram 20mg every day. Instant change! I have had zero symptoms of  PMDD. It also stopped my postpartum/breastfeeding hot flashes that I had been having for 2 years! My side effects I think are only reduced libido but also still breastfeeding so I think a combination of factors. Amazing drug!!",Thespine

3,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2020",10,I just started Celexa 20mg for PMDD after being on Zoloft for two years. I must say Celexa is winning. I started my period and it’s been the most peaceful week in a long time. I am experiencing dry mouth and insomnia but anything is better than feeling  like a crazy lady.,Eri
4,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 20, 2020",8,"I am 31 years old and since I was about 27 years old my PMDD symptoms became unbearable. For two weeks out of EVERY month I would turn into a severely fatigued, rage filled, irrational monster with sky high anxiety, EXTREME tearfulness, and panic attacks. For these two weeks my whole body aches/throbs and swells, especially my joints and muscles. My arms, back, legs, ankles, wrists, and feet all hurt so much and I even get muscle spasms in my back. I also was having Post Partum Depression severely. Within 4 days citalopram completely stopped my panic attacks, intrusive/OCD thoughts and my depression is slowly but surely being cured as well! I am in what is usually to be my worst week of my cycle amd mentally and I feel great. It has not done anything for my physical pain. Dry mouth and nausea subsided after a few days however the drowsiness and difficulty orgasming have not. GAVE ME MY LIFE BACK!",Mel
5,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 24, 2020",16,"Oh wow! I am grateful you all shared your experiences on citalopram! I thought I was crazy. My PMT has gotten really worse over the last few years and really every two weeks of the month I turned into a crazy creature and it affected all my close relationships. I tried vitamin B but it helped only a little. So now trying Citalopram for the first time, 10mg for half my cycle.I don’t really like the idea of taking regular medication for anything but I had run out of solutions so I’m hoping this works.",Anonymous
6,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,,"February 1, 2020",28,"I am taking only 5mg of citalopram and my life has already changed, I was angry irritated and shouting at my kids every two weeks before my periods, it got worse a couple of days before my period and I would feel suicidal, malevolent and anxious. After taking this medication for 6 weeks  my life is back  on track I have better relationship with my partner and teenage children I am more calm and I have more energy. I do get the odd suicidal thoughts but I just brush them away. Overall I am grateful.",Kia
7,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,,"July 25, 2019",14,"I had tried about half a dozen other medications and given up for a couple of years. My doc had offered citalopram the year before but I had been ""burned"" by other meds and didn't believe it would help so didn't take it. My PMDD worsened this year (35 y/o) and it was going to end up costing me my job at the rate I was going. Could NOT control my mood at all. I was legit calling in once a month (2-3 days prior to period) because my mood was so unstable. I agreed to try the citalopram with some as needed vistaril for the bad anxiety.Within the first few days I was feeling better. In two weeks it was visible to everyone around me. The side effects were mild:  Sweating, breast tenderness, dry mouth, a 'strange' feeling for a few days, & yawning. The only side effect that still gets to me is the sexual dysfunction. I've had exactly one orgasm in the two months I've been on it and it was not really worth the effort but I'll take weak orgasms over being dead any day.",Tak
8,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 9, 2019",19,"I was prescribed this for severe PMS 4 weeks ago and I can definitely feel the difference, I take 10 mg in the morning and have had no side effects whatsoever I realised since taking this that my intrusive thoughts had been part of OCD and it had never occurred to me ! I just thought that was a part of me ! I have the occasional disturbing thought but I am able to brush it off easily I am generally calmer and more in control of my emotions",Sorry

10,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 18, 2018",50,"I never realised I was ill. I thought my moods were just part of what my parents called my character. I have always had severe up and downs, an inability to make decisions and my PMS cost me two weeks every month. During that time I started fights, cried as if the world was ending and felt utterly useless. During the worst days of my PMS I thought about ways to kill myself. I have struggled with depression and anxiety my entire adult life. I blamed my ‘weak character’ for this. I have been on Citalopram 20mg for almost two months and I feel like a normal human again. I never thought life could feel this good. This drug saved my life. I have no side effects.",Becks
11,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,,"September 2, 2018",14,"From the time I turned 35, I was  irritable, low energy, bloated and awful insomnia for two weeks of my cycle. I was diagnosed with PMDD and prescribed Citalopram. I started the 20mg and became depressed, withdrawn, in a fog and nauseous and stopped after 3 days. My doctor then prescribed 10mg and although I was still depressed, it was better on the low dose. I had bad insomnia but after a week, that went away and I started taking it at night which cured all side effects. When my bad weeks started, I had insomnia like usual and bloating, although was not as low energy. I switched to 20mg and insomnia started again but not nearly as bad effects. Today, three days after I started taking the 20mg, I feel good, no bloating and it should be the worst week of my cycle. I hope the insomnia will go away soon too. I am planning to stay on 10mg throughout the month and take 20 mg just for the bad weeks.",Becky
12,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,,"September 30, 2017",14,"I had forgotten that I had PMDD!  I was prescribed citalopram for considerable anxiety and mild depression while I was going through a nasty divorce.  I have been on citalopram for a few years now, since about January 2014.  I forgot to pick up repeat prescription and I thought as divorce now finished (June 2015) and all good with my life (even accepting normal trial and tribulations of difficult hormonal teenager!)  I would be fine and should just get on with it and not worry about taking it anymore.  Wow, was I wrong, period overdue and  PMDD back as it was at its worst.  Needless to say will be back at docs to discuss and continue as there is no way I will come off this until I am post menopausal (soon but until then citalopram).",KT66
13,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 7, 2017",42,"I have been suffering from PMDD for years. During the week before my period, during my period and the 2 days prior to ovulation. It's taken years to get this bad though. I have never got very far with doctors. I was offered hormonal contraception repeatedly and always refused, as I was frightened that it would be enough to tip me over the edge. I got to a point where I just couldn't cope with it anymore, and so I spoke to a different doctor, a female doctor who knew me well. I started the usual speech, I even had everything written down, and she stopped me halfway. She knew exactly what to do. So, I am now on half cycle 10mg citalopram. I take it when I need to (2 weeks a month). For the first time in years, I feel normal.",LongSufferer
14,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 17, 2017",7,I being on Celexa 20 mg for 2 weeks to treat premenstrual dysphoric disorder. I don't know if is going to work for me yet but the symptoms I have experience now is a lot of nausea yawning and I feel extremely tired. My sleep patterns also change I want to sleep during the day and at night am wide awake. I guess I will tell all this symptoms to my doctor on my 4 week visit which is in 2 weeks and see what she thinks about it.,kozmoz
15,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,,"January 9, 2017",25,"I have been on those pills for years now after suffering from PMDD. This is THE VERY BEST. I have a history of depression, but , at the time it was prescribed to me, I was charming 27 days out of the month. 2 days prior my periods, I turned into a witch, a depressed one. It affected my relationship with my kids, my loving partner. I'm saying that now, because a week ago, I ran out of them, having missed my physical. Those mood swings came back like a freight train and I literally had to beg my doctor to give me enough before my next visit. I'll be more careful next time but I can't help wondering if the symptoms are worsened if you get off it... or maybe I just forgot how bad it was!",Mrs Munchkin
16,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 14, 2016",35,"Ive always been a moody person, but since having my 2nd child it had become a whole new animal. PMDD had left me feeling very lonely, helpless and worthless, I was tired of hearing myself apologize again for my awful behaviour during those last 2 weeks of my cycle, only to find myself back there 2 weeks later, My kids were suffering, my relationhip was too and At my lowest during my cycle, I was starting to plan my suicide. I went to my doctor, sure he would just brush me off, thinking it was just you know, slamming cupboards and sore boobs (if only!!)  I went during my down weeks so he could see the state I was in, I was so desperate for relief.  Started Celexa that day and its changed my life, if you have PMDD you must try this.",Kkmalay

It works well, and also helps my PMDD.  I tried other antidepressants but would recommend Celexa because it really helps me function.

18,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,,"December 11, 2015",14,"I was prescribed this drug a few years ago for mild depression. The first time I had no real side effects except nausea for a few days. I was on it for 6 months. About a month ago I went to the Dr for my PMS symptoms and he decided to try it again. This time I had no appetite for 2 weeks. I felt sick every time I ate. Very tired and not wanting to do anything. I also still have diarrhoea every morning. I'm becoming dehydrated. Other than that I feel great, except now I have zero sex drive. My husband is suffering because of this. Even if I try and get into it I can't orgasm. It's hard to decide if the good outweighs the bad. I'm probably going to switch meds.",Confused63729001837

My anxiety, moodiness, anger, irritability, depression, rage, and even my cravings have subsided. Celexa has worked wonders for me. Sometimes, I'm in a dark place, but not as much as I used to. I also no longer hurt myself or have thoughts of hurting myself. Finally, I feel like I want to ""live"" again. I am not going on any other medication but Celexa.",Cherokeeprincess

The cumulative torture of my monthly cycle had resulted in a nervous breakdown and I was thinking about suicide. I am fascinated to find out what it is like NOT to suffer (as this was normal for me) the only negative is no sex drive.If you suffer PMDD..try it!,kim 1234

I just found out I have PMDD and for a long time I have been suffering with depression along with anxiety.

23,Citalopram,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,,"December 14, 2009",66,Celexa (citalopram):This medicine is great. It has changed the way I feel on a daily basis. Every month about 1 week before my period all my muscles would hurt as if I was lifting heavy weights. I do work out but not hard enough to be that sore all week. I talk to my doctor and found out that I had PMDD. I was always in a bad mood and little things at home would just set me off but thanks to the combination of both I feel a lot better about myself and am always in a great mood. When I first started the Celexa I was always tired but know I have more energy. I have not had any issues with any of the medicine.,tator
