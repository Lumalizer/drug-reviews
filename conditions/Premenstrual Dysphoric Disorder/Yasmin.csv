0,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 11, 2022",2,"I started talking this pill 1.5 month ago for PMDD. I still have PMS to some degree but my mood is SO MUCH BETTER! I was really sceptic to take this at first because of all the negative experiences I read, but I gave it a try anyway.. I feel like I am myself again. I feel happier, am less anxious (which was severe), I can handle stressful situations better. My sex drive has gone up because I’m not always in pain or depressed anymore. I still need to take it longer to notice full effects, but the ones I’ve already noticed are life changing for me. I am so much more confident about myself. I don’t feel puffy anymore. No more swollen stomach. My acne is not gone (yet) but is a LOT better than it used to be. My wounds heal better. My skin looks more moisturised and clear. I have more energy,… the only downside is that I’m very tired in the morning. I will come back for update after 3 months of taking it",Fruitjuice
1,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 17, 2021",1,"I've been on Yasmin for around 2 years now and it has been such a lifesaver. Before this I had PMDD and would only have 1 good week in the month, the rest of the time I would be angry, irritable and sad to the point of having major depressive episodes that really affected my relationships with people. I've noticed cumulative improvements with this pill and now I'm much more stable and happy. I take mine back to back so I have a period once every 3 months and this works great for me!Things I've noticed:Good stuff:-No acne anymore-My boobs grew-Period cramps reduced (but mine were debilitating so they are still painful)-Shorter periodsBad stuff:-Vaginal dryness-Lowered sex drive-Increased susceptibility to yeast infections",mimi
2,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 20, 2021",0,I’d taken Yasmin previously about 7 or so years ago for birth control and had no problems with it. I had started taking it again after having 2 children to help manage my PMDD and I felt nauseous all day and had very little energy or motivation to do anything I had to stop taking it after about a week because I just felt so awful all the time.,Shi
3,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 3, 2021",1,Only been on it for a week and can already feel anxiety creeping up. Bad headaches and struggling to fall asleep every night. Has anyone suffered from insomnia from this pill ??? Read all the reviews and I am completely horrified I am stopping this pill ASAP. OH and it’s a rip off 80 bucks for Insomnia and anxiety?,Stef
4,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,1.0,,"June 17, 2021",8,"I started Yasmin as I read that it helped with severe PMS and didn’t cause weight gain. In short, thought I was dying when taking this.

5,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 18, 2020",31,"This pill really does get a hard time! After reading all these reviews I completely understand people will have differing reactions to taking it.... but WOW Yasmin has been a game changer for me. I suffered with severe PMDD up to 9 days before my period and would completely change as a person, irrational, crying and starting arguments, incredibly sensitive and paranoid .... this lasted until my period came and then I would have another 2 weeks of feeling great until the build up started again. This pill along with taking 10mg of Citalopram daily has literally changed my life. I suffered for years and years with PMDD and finally live a normal life now, still get a little scratchy a couple of days before period with a little increase in how hungry I am .... but that is it! Best thing I ever did! :)",Lucyloo
6,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 25, 2020",17,"I took this medication Yasmin in order to regularise my periods and avoid PMS symptoms of mood swings. However this pill worsened my situation. I have been suffering form immense depression and anxiety ever since. Anxiety with fast heartbeats. I've been possessive and anything around me would trigger emotional outbursts of crying and anger. I have cried every single day I took this pill.  if you've got pre-exisiting anxiety or depression , I would advise you don't take this pill. It will literally ruin your life. I have got 4 days left for the pill. Never taking it again after that .",aj
7,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 18, 2020",57,"I was reluctant to try a birth control for PMDD. I wasn't too confident it would help, and was concerned it would make me worse or something. However, after 2 months of being on Yasmin, I noticed GREAT improvement!! The first month I might have noticed about 25% improvement, but still had depression (which can get really bad 1 week prior to period). Second month, I noticed about a 70% improvement in PMS symptoms. Third month I noticed an additional improvement. I still get moody, but not severely depressed . This BC truly has helped me so so much. I just want to write my experience so others with PMDD can have hope.",nellie
8,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 18, 2019",7,"Yasmin was prescribed by my gynaecologist to balance my hormones. I have struggled with depressive episodes before but been well for the last 1.5 years. I have been on Yasmin for the last 2 weeks and they have been my darkest days, darker than my previous depressive episodes. I couldn't recognize myself, my sex drive has been zero, had no desire to live,  and had no interest in my work. Am only a day off Yasmin and I feel much better mentally. I regret not taking seriously the huge list of side effects indicated in the large pamphlet. If you have struggled with depression, Yasmin is not for you.",Karey
9,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 8, 2019",1,Yasmin cause me to have acne and oily all over my face. I still choose the Diane pill  over this because it makes my skin looks so much better.,Ann
10,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 20, 2018",3,"I'm using it now. I started 8 months ago and I feel totally normal. No mood changes, or acne. Yes, a have some pounds more but nothing I can fix with food and exercise. I love it.",Ivet
11,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 19, 2018",11,"I have had severe depression and anxiety since my early teens. I’m now 29 and last year I went off Effexor (antidepressant) as it stopped working. I went on a number of antidepressants after that, the last one was Prozac, which gave me the worst  acne of my life, even 6 months after I came off it.  I’ve been on Yasmin for just a month, and finally my acne has calmed down. My skin is almost entirely clear, my moods have stabilised (still get a bit depressed and anxious but recover quickly) and my boobs have gone up TWO CUPS SIZES! I have always been really flat-cheated and suddenly I have boobs, it’s great. They are painful, hopefully that subsides. Even if they go back to normal, I am so thankful to Yasmin. I feel sane again!",Kez
12,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 17, 2018",3,"I suffered PMT in my youth & after years of being free at the age of 42 the condition  came back with even more severity. I was prescribe Yasmin by my gynea & the first month was fantastic. I am now in my second month & my symptoms are worse than ever. I have constant headaches, severe bloating, cramps, break through bleeding & chronic fatigue. I am hoping the third month will regulate my cycle & settle the symptoms.",Clara
13,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 1, 2017",20,"I've been on Yasmin for about a month and a half now. I didn't experience any side effects for the first two weeks of taking it, and then gradually I started feeling more moody, irritable and depressed. My sex drive also went away around the time it would normally be in overdrive. I haven't gotten any acne from this pill, nor weight gain. I did notice that I wasn't nearly as crazy just before my period like normal, so it has helped with actual PMDD so far. I'm now halfway through my second month on it, and it actually seems better so far. My sex drive has improved and I haven't been moody or depressed. Still no acne or weight gain. I think this pill just takes time to adjust to your body  for some people.",Yasmin User
14,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 3, 2016",31,I was having pretty heavy pms and very irregular mensturation cycle. Now I'm almost on my first year with Yasmin and never ever pms anymore. I feel even happier as my period gets closer. All thanks to yasmin. It took a little time for my body to get adjusted. Almost for first 2 months it made it worse than ever. But I knew that was gonna happen so I was patient. And it ended up extremely well. I recommend it for anyone having severe pms and emotional problems related to period. It's also really good to know exactly when to have your period.,ElifZ
15,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 26, 2015",5,"I have started taken yasmin after reading reviews about how good it is for acne and PMS , and I had very frequent periods that I needed to regulate ,   but soon after taking the 1st tablet I had severe nausea that lasted all day , 3 days down the line I became very low in mood , I was very tearful , the slightest things would irritate me , I had never felt like this in ages, I was  taking accutane at the same time , so I attributed the low mood to accutane. Since I couldn't tolerate the severe nausea , I stopped taking yasmin and strangely my mood suddenly changed , I was no longer depressed or tearful and I was still on accutane. I think people react differently to medications , but I am sure yasmin wasn't the right OCP for me.",tenatona
16,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 4, 2012",58,"I'm using Yasmin as a Birth control but also to treat acne and PMS symptoms. Let me tell you, Yasmin is awesome! -I've just finished 1 cycle of Yasmin and all my acne and pimples have disappeared, now my skin is very clear and even somewhat glows. -All my PMS symptoms have subsided, no more cramps and period pain (you hardly feel that you're on your period because it is so light), period comes very much on time.- I used to get occasional mood swings before, during and after my periods but I haven't been in bad mood this entire month. Yasmin really helped with my mood swing.I highly recommend Yasmin.",Anonymous
17,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,2.0,,"December 6, 2011",16,I have been on Yaz for 2 months now to fix my newly discovered hormonal imbalance. I felt the effects of the pill after a week. I am far more emotional and am seriously depressed. Major mood swings. On a happier note my periods are regular and last 4 days with little cramping and little to no bloating. Above all I do not feel myself. Once my 3 month trial is done I'm definitely going to explore my options and steer away from birth control. I do not feel myself anymore.,Anonymous
18,Yasmin,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,,"July 21, 2009",19,"So far I really like Yasmin, I had a mild problem with acne and serious mood swings. I was also having a significant amount of dark coarse facial hair due low amounts of estrogen. I've seen improvements in all 3 areas. I started taking Yasmin on the second day of my period and by the third day, my period was gone. The only downer is that it makes me really tired. I'm always a little cranky because I'm sleepy. It seems as though Yasmin is good for a lot of other problems young women have and it's just a plus that it prevents pregnancy.",Anonymous
