0,Zoloft,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 25, 2022",1,"For a few years now I have been experiencing severe PMS. High irritability,  anxiety and mood swing. I am 42 years old and it started around 38 years of age. Around that time I also became a mom, so that was an added stressor. Coping became extremely difficult during PMS time.  I would have severe mood swings which caused me to have fights with family,  friends and co-workers.  I tried therapy but it was pretty useless. A doctor prescribed me zoloft  but I have always stayed away from pharmaceutical drugs because of the long list of side effects. I finally decided to take it as it was hurting my family life and my anger and anxiety were becoming unmanageable and the guilt would throw me into severe depression.  So far 4 months on the lowest dose, 25 mg, I haven't had what I call a ""psycholotic episode "", which usually means a severe outburst and mood swing. I haven't experienced any side effects thank goodness. I only had a lot of sweating in the start and that was it.",Queen

2,Zoloft,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 20, 2021",0,I used it to treat PMDD and it made my symptoms worse. 10mg once a day. It was horrible. Nothing seemed to matter anymore. Not even my kids. Nothing to hold on too. It made me very suicidal. Stopped after two weeks after consulting my doctor.,Nina
3,Zoloft,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 4, 2021",2,Started off on 25mg. Noticed physical side effects but were easy to deal with. After a week I moved up to 50mg.  Anxiety spiked after I took it but I have been/am in therapy so I knew how to handle it. Did make it worse than before to the point where one night I had to try and put off a panic attack for an hour. Next night after taking it I got so suicidal. That was the last day I took it but it was still in my system. For the next 2 days I still felt it + considered crashing my car. Part of the reason I was put on this was suicidal thoughts + Zoloft made it SO much worse. Will never touch again unless it's to burn it. Almost everyone I've talked to who's been on it said it was the worst experience of their life. Congrats if you're apart of the 1% this pill actually works for. CNP told me out of 500 patients she's prescribed it to (she was biased since it worked for her) only 2-3 ended up feeling suicidal. Well she can now make that lie 3-4,hey girl
4,Zoloft,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 15, 2021",7,"Hi there, I tried quite a few antidepressants, but only Zoloft deserves my review. I have been taking Sertraline for almost a month and I am so happy that I didn't give up on changing from my previous Escitalopram, Prozac, Citalopram. I suffer from PDD, then from PTD and anxiety. First two weeks were hard, but I started to have interest in activities again (week 4). Don't worry about weight gain, I was that's why I stopped Escitalopram, Zoloft does not make me feel ravenous at all. So glad",Luna
5,Zoloft,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 23, 2020",13,"I had to share my experience because it has been awful. I’ve taken zoloft on and off for years for PMDD. While it did help regulate my moods, I’ve had the worst gastrointestinal issues ever since I was prescribed this drug. I finally put 2 and 2 together.I would be out shopping/at a football game/in my car driving and have to find a bathroom IMMEDIATELY. I would have a sudden and very intense urge to use the restroom. (Think Dumb & Dumber) It was so embarrassing. I would start sweating from the pain. Do you know how many unnecessary invasive tests I’ve had done trying to figure out why I can’t control my bowels and they whole time it was this drug?What good is regulating your moods if you feel like you’re going to poop your pants several times a month???",KC
6,Zoloft,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 27, 2020",14,"SSRI’s are totally different for everyone so this is just my personal experience. But I was started out on 25mg of Zoloft following manic episodes after I quit birth control cold turkey. Zoloft made me feel worse than a zombie. Not only was it hard to even speak, it was hard to *think*. I felt very loopy and out of it all the time and it did nothing for my anxiety except make it slightly harder to think about, because thinking of anything felt like a feat. I went off of it and immediately felt better. I switched to Prozac and my doctors and I are trying to find the dose that’s right for me. Just pay attention to how you’re feeling and monitor things carefully, especially on SSRIs. Everyone has different and specific needs.",JeanieK
7,Zoloft,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 21, 2020",30,"I started taking Zoloft 12.5 mg for my premenstural dysphoric disorder and felt better immediately - went up to 25mg , and now steadily at 50 mg daily. It worked superbly for my PMDD and anxiety, though it did exacerbate my depression quite a bit (irritability), which I fixed with adding Wellbutrin. All in all this combination really worked for me and gave me the chance to see life as worth living. I could never maintain a decent lifestyle before, and now I can. Medications aren't a fix for everybody, but damn did this work well for me.",Franky Krum
8,Zoloft,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,,"June 23, 2020",18,"My Doctor switched me to zoloft I was taking bupropion for about 5 months, but it was causing me to be snappy and a lot of anxiety. So he switched me to zoloft, its been 3 weeks and the first week and a half was the hardest I had nausea, diarrhea, tiredness. But it went away now I'm only tired at times but feel way better. I recommend it.",Tt

The first week I took this I began having the worse anxiety attacks of my life. Too nauseous to eat, diarrhea, and migraines. I waited it out a month suffering from extreme anxiety which it was suppose to help me get rid of in the first place. Made my usual anxiety seem like nothing. It did nothing at all for my chronic pain, made me feel as if I was going crazy and not able to function.",Martely
10,Zoloft,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 9, 2020",46,"I have had PMDD for some time. I was initially prescribed Prozac and it did nothing. I take a high dose 100mg during luteal phase of period and it helps. Not symptom free but more manageable. The side effects are tiredness (too mellow and not hyper motivated) and weight gain but I can live with this instead of extreme mood changes prior to Zoloft.  It also helps me manage work and personal life better. It takes the edge off. My symptoms include racing obsessive  thoughts, anger, raging, paranoia primarily (general distrust of all human beings). I still get food cravings and some thoughts but they are dramatically reduced. I try to manage PMDD with diet, supplements (magnesium), yoga etc. Too. It is a tough mood disorder and wish I knew what I had years ago.",Anonymous

The first day I took it, I was so nauseated and had the worst diarrhea which is a common side effect, especially first taking it. I have been on celexa in the past, never had such stomach problems like I did with Zoloft. After 1 day, never again. To each their own though. Wouldn’t recommend - especially if you have a stomach that is sensitive or if you have IBS.",Bee
14,Zoloft,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,,"March 1, 2019",207,"I used to cry uncontrollably, be extremely irritable, uncomfortable in my body, lethargic, so depressed I couldn't get out of bed, have suicidal ideation, etc.Now with Zoloft I have NONE of those symptoms anymore. My relationships are no longer being torn apart. I don't feel embarrassed by illogical mood swings or uncontrollable blabbering. I don't cry myself to sleep. I feel happy, optimistic, peaceful and completely BALANCED. Zoloft had given me my life back.I had to stop taking it for 2 months due to a different health issue. ALL of my symptoms returned. I was basically losing my mind for two months. A couple of weeks back on Zoloft and I was again calm, happy, peaceful.I don't have any noticeable side effects. I started at 25mg for the first 5 months (still got quite lethargic and depressed) and now I am on 50mg and I'm like all those women running through fields in white dresses in tampon commercials.

15,Zoloft,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,,,"December 13, 2018",116,"Wish I had started this years ago!  I was terrified to start medication,  it was the last resort after trying natural ways to deal w/ PMDD for years.  Every month, I'd have serious depression/ anxiety/ uncontrollable crying spells/ want to leave my family the 4 days prior to period. As soon as my cycle started, I was completely normal. I thought it was just me, until I started tracking and was diagnosed with  PMDD.  I resisted using medication thinking I could handle symptoms on my own.  Mistake. I started taking zoloft ONLY during my luteal phase and the very first month had relief!  Since taking, my PMDD symptoms have almost completely subsided.    I have not noticed any negative side effects.  I was worried about diminished sex drive, but found that my sex drive has increased during the luteal phase since I'm not suffering from the effects of PMDD.",M.M.

The nausea and drowsiness the first 3 days was tough (horrible the first 24 hours, then got better). But this was the first month I didn't cry at the dinner table with my family in ages. My general mood was totally normal and not overly sensitive or aggressive. I didn't have any sexual side effects, and no menstrual cramps when my period arrived.

18,Zoloft,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,10.0,,"August 4, 2017",61,"I wish that I would have started this drug much sooner. I was very reluctant to take an antidepressant mainly due to stigma. I felt immediate relief from anxiety, paranoia, irritability, hopeless, helpless, suicidal, depressed and feeling out of control. I have had major symptoms for several years premenstrual and it has been premenstrual dysphoric disorder. I am very thankful for Zoloft and I don't ever want to be caught without it it is the best thing that has happened to me in a very long time. The side effects are very minimal my side effects would include just being a little tired some gas and Mild diarrhea at times. I would trade this any day for the problems that I was having before I started taking Zoloft it truly has saved my life .",LovingMotherx4

I had to stop taking Zoloft after six months due to bad vertigo but it definitely helped the PMDD symptoms. Switched to venlafaxine and found that to be great, but first three days are so hard. Headaches, low mood, heavy feeling in head and body. It worked though. Zoloft also fixed my restless leg syndrome which had not responded to any other treatment.",Mummy bear

I primarily take it for stress, anxiety, and depression.  Once I was told by a psychiatrist that I could have PMDD even though I haven't been diagnosed with the condition by a gynecologist, it's because I would have severe crying spells days before my period so severe that I wouldn't stop crying, and I would feel extremely sensitive emotionally.  I still cry a little before I get period sometimes, but the medication I take seems to work well to keep my nerves calm.  In addition I have bipolar depression, PTSD, social anxiety, and ADD/ADHD.  Ritalin is another medication that I also take.",AshleyNave100

I went to a new doctor desperate to find anything that would help. The mood swings, hopelessness, anger and lack of interest was interfering in my home and work life. I have been suffering for years and it was only getting worse. She suggested trying this medication in combination with a low dose hormone supplement. It has worked wonders!

Every month around that time I just wanted to leave my marriage. I was irritable beyond understanding and felt like punching something if I got angry. I would cry at the drop of a hat. I just wanted to be alone. I tried exercise, diet and natural remedies but it was never enough. I felt like I had a ball of metal in my stomach. I would scream and yell and get upset if you looked at me the wrong way. It was horrible. On zoloft I feel calm and stable. I have had no side effects. It has been a saving grace.

I truly believe this is not a placebo affect- as I am horribly negative around my menstrual cycle, I physically and mentally feel a change [more focus towards tasks and not current worries and willing to get up and go!] The PA i see said I could either take zoloft 3 weeks out of the month or I could take it daily for the whole month. I chose daily dosing. I'm so glad I made the leap to actually talk to someone and get a diagnosis of PMDD",Nicoleashley88

I had all the signs of PMDD but most Doctors don't address mental issues during your well woman exam. I spoke with a NP one day and she listen. Zoloft work instantly... I feel normal for once in 9 years. I feel level headed. I hated the person I was.. I was mean and unapologetic. I was emotional wreck. I could cry at a drop of a hat.

Since 12, I have been incapacitated not just by cyclical mood/anxiety issues--I felt ""normal"" for only about 1 week/month. But the WORST part was the abdominal cramps & the bloating/gas/messing with my GI tract, and 2-3 days/month were pure H#LL.

It was a relief to finally have a diagnosis because I had developed progressively worse physical and physiological symptoms in the two weeks before my period. It had started to interfere with my schooling since I'd miss two days per cycle at least (which is a lot for a high school senior with AP classes). I was prescribed Beyaz a month ago and quit after 3 days because I was an emotional wreck. Another week or so went by and my symptoms got worse again.

By the third, I was a basket case. This is also when the weight gain kicked in - I gained almost 15 lbs in 5-6 weeks. If I wasn't depressed before, this definitely did the trick.

I found this to give me headaches and tremors. So I decided to split the pill in 2 pieces and take half in the morning and half with lunch. I only had to do this for about a week; I now take the whole 25 mg in the morning, with or without food, no problems. No serious side effects, definitely not enough to outweigh the benefits. Zoloft has absolutely given me my life back! I was afraid to take it, especially after all of the negative reviews, but I am so happy I gave it a try. Wonderful!",Anonymous

I have no PMS/PMDD symptoms at all right now. I hope they never return. Zoloft has changed my life. I hope it isn't too soon to tell if the good times will continue but I hope and pray they do. I haven't had any side effects except for one. If I take it in the morning, I get extremely sleepy by mid-afternoon. So I take it at night, problem solved. Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones but for so many years I have suffered from PMDD with no relief, that for once, I can brag about how good I feel now! I hope the same for other women experiencing PMS and PMDD.",worleygirl41

I finally found a solution to my disorder.  I take Zoloft 1 x 50mg pill everyday and 2 weeks before my period I take 2 pills (100mg).  I never felt better.,Anonymous
47,Zoloft,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,,,"July 14, 2008",90,"For the past few years, I felt like I had a little demon sitting on my shoulders. The irritability and anger were bad enough to interfere with my daily life, work and relationships. When I began taking Zoloft I suffered severe headaches and fatigue. However, my doctor had warned me this would happen but would go away. Eventually, the side effects did disappear. I have to say that I did experience a total relief from the irritability.",Jaci0620
48,Zoloft,Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,9.0,,"June 3, 2008",41,For years I suffered migraines and I swore they were menstrual related and no one believed me until finally a nurse practitioner discussed Prementrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) with me.  My severe moods and migraines were relieved as long as I stayed on Zoloft.  PMDD is worse than PMS and I find not as easily diagnosed.  I have been having more migraines lately but I am not sure if I have missed doses or need to increase.  Zoloft has definitly helped me.,shelter

I am calmer about situations that I generally get angry about and the headaches I use to have have decreased dramatically.",Anonymous
