0,Terbinafine,Tinea Pedis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 31, 2021",0,"Lamisil (terbinafine):My diagnosis was initially gout since an infection started in my big toe on the left foot, and for over 2 weeks infection spread into smaller toes on the right foot and the bigger toe on the right foot, then more toes on the left foot as well. Both feet had itchy cracks between the toes AND A CRUSTY TEXTURE AROUND THE FOOT TOO, AND EVEN ON THE HEELS THE SKIN THICKENED, ALONG WITH THE BOTTOMS OF MY FEET REALLY BURNING AND IT STARTED WITH A LOT OF difficulties WALKING. Then my diagnosis became Athlete's foot and I sent pictures to my doctor who agreed!! I have used Lamisil 1% Cream for about a month and then I burned my fingers and had to heal them. I stopped using the Lamisil, also thinking my Athlete's foot felt a lot better, and after a week the Athlete's foot came back, and I am re-applying the Lamisil 1% cream. I am glad my fingers healed so that I could get back to getting rid of the Athlete's foot. This is the first time I ever got Athlete's foot and I never went to a gym either.",cindy V
1,Terbinafine,Tinea Pedis,5.0,,"January 4, 2021",2,"So far my experience with terbinafine has been a love/intesnse dislike type thing. I was initially prescribed it because of severe athletes feet for 2 weeks. I went back to the doctors office for a checkup and he prescribed it again. The first 2 weeks everything was fine. I'm in the 2nd week of the re-prescription and the side affects are a mess. I've been having mild headaches, occasional liver pain, and occasional bloating.  None of the side affects are just horrendous but I feel as if I need to discontinue the medicine before it gets bad.  Meanwhile, my feet have been getting better and the fungus is 95% healed.",HT
2,Terbinafine,Tinea Pedis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2019",6,"I was prescribed terbinafine for moccasin-type tinea pedis. I took one single pill and woke up the next day without a sense of taste. I am a chef. This drug has the potential to destroy my life, my livelihood, and my greatest source of happiness. My sense of taste has not yet returned, which terrifies me. I also proceeded to poop my guts out with the most painful diarrhea since having food poisoning a decade ago. I was sobbing on the toilet. DO NOT RECOMMEND. I have no idea how a drug this awful is allowed to remain on the market.",ThunderGoddess
3,Terbinafine,Tinea Pedis,5.0,,"April 26, 2019",1,"My podiatrist prescribed me generic terbinafine and to take it in pulses of one week on one week off, and so on. Well, I finished week one and was fine, just some headache and sore throat. But during my week off, I came up with a fever, & sore throat got worst. I slept it off and felt fine the next day. Told my podiatrist & he recommended I stop taking it...I was glad to stop, but, I notice new nail growing in. I wish I could continue treatment since I have been dealing with toenail fungus for 25+ years. Has anyone took it once a week instead of everyday? Iâ€™m thinking about just take one pill a week.",LR

6,Terbinafine,Tinea Pedis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 16, 2018",3,"I was only able to stay on it for a month. I had seen some improvement, but the side effects were awful. Especially the insomnia affected every aspect of my life and health. Doctor switched me to the cream, which seems to be working well with no side effects.",Scratchy

9,Terbinafine,Tinea Pedis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 18, 2017",11,"Lamisil (terbinafine):I can't believe how well this medicine worked! I had athlete's foot for five years on my left foot & for six months on my right foot. My entire left foot on the bottom & sides & in between my toes itched like crazy at times. Every day I suffered with my foot itching in the shower or whenever my foot sweated.  I scratched so hard in the shower that my foot bled, and I really felt like I was suffering & that wasn't too strong of a word. I tried a few things that I read online & nothing helped. I finally tried Lamisil 1%, using it twice a day for six weeks & missing a few doses. Directions are for two weeks. It finally cured my athlete's foot! It's costly but worth every penny. I still use it occasionally to be on the safe side. I rate it 10*!",athlete's foot
10,Terbinafine,Tinea Pedis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 9, 2017",2,"Never works for me. N.B. I am talking about the ointment. It goes on greasy, is generally a nuisance, and then over the next couple of days the skin on top of my foot gets progressively puffier. The greasiness cannot be overstated. This makes the itching worse and you have to wear sandals even after you've quit using it.",BernardShakey
11,Terbinafine,Tinea Pedis,,,"June 22, 2017",10,"Great drug, zero side effects- I would not believe any of the horror story side effect posts. Absolutely zero side effects but clear toe nails and resolution of horrible itchy rashes that plagued the bottom of my feet for years. My liver was fine the whole time. A breeze. 3 month course.",cr38
12,Terbinafine,Tinea Pedis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 10, 2016",11,Lamisil (terbinafine):I had a monster athletes foot. After four or five days my feet stopped itching and they aren't yellow anymore. I will never buy the dollar store brand of antifungal ever again.,Amadia
13,Terbinafine,Tinea Pedis,10.0,,"September 5, 2015",11,"Lamisil (terbinafine):I got athletes foot from the shower room at camp in 2006. From then I had it off and on for years. Finally after years of discomfort and pain and so much itching that I would literally get open sores from it- I finally looked up the best product for athletes foot. And in a few days years of pain and discomfort were permanently gone! Don't ask me why I didn't try it sooner. I love this stuff. It's a little pricey but well worth it. You only need to use a small amount of product so the tube (I bought a cream) lasts for a long time. I believe it says to use it for a week- DO SO. Similar to an antibiotic, you have to use it even after you think it's gone. I didn't and it recurred a week later. Used it for a week and it hasn't come back since.",Emily17
14,Terbinafine,Tinea Pedis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 16, 2013",5,"I used this on a tinea problem on my eleven year old. Initially it was extremely itchy, and I thought he was just being wimpy (shame on me as a parent), as he later developed a strong case of hives on the legs, which was exacerbated by swimming at a swimming pool. A strong red rash and hives resulted, before settling. He took an antihistamine tablet, with no further problems since.",Tul

I could not even wear summer sandals my feet were so dry and rashy. For the first week of taking terbinafine I felt very nauseous and dizzy and nearly stopped taking it, however I have seen an amazing improvement in my feet lately. I was also prescribed 10% Beta steroid cream in a cetamacrogol moisturiser to put on every day. I reckon the terbinafine has helped my overall health and skin.",kwkiwigirl
