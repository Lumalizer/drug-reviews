0,Ivermectin,COVID-19,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2022",2,"Husband (72) tested positive and was on a scary decline. Was able to get Ivermectin and is on the mend now.  As for myself (58), I have not gotten it so far. Doctor gave me preventive ivermectin treatment. We are 16 days in this illness. I wish I had been able to get ivermectin sooner for my husband but even after 7 days delay he has been hospital free. He is overweight, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetic, and unvaccinated. We are thankful.",survived
1,Ivermectin,COVID-19,,,"January 25, 2022",8,It works. I think I had delta and started it on day one of testing positive. Was better in 3 days. Wife didn’t take it and ended up getting covid pneumonia! She wishes she took it bc she was sick for 3 weeks,JBw
2,Ivermectin,COVID-19,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 2, 2022",11,"I tried it and had terrible just terrible neurological side effects. I even took a pretty low does 9mg. If you have any CNS issues whatsoever or have had tinnuties, peripheral nerve issues DO NOT TAKE THIS. I am suffering big time with shaking, internal vibrations, and nerve issues and crossing my fingers this goes away.",Sick in Miami
3,Ivermectin,COVID-19,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 8, 2021",13,"I am a 38 year old female and took ivermectin for 9 days. I would rate my experience as 1/10. I started ivermectin 2 days after getting a positive COVID-19 test. I don’t think ivermectin works at all! I have pneumonia and I can barely breathe. I can hardly walk and I can’t keep food down and literally feel like death.  I have literally been having diarrhea, nausea and sometimes throwing up since I started it and so i don't know if it's from the Covid or the Ivermectin but on advice from urgent care I stopped it today to see if maybe I’m having a bad reaction. This sucks! I can’t believe I’m still sick at almost 2 weeks. Can’t hardly move or anything.I’m taking steroids, albuterol, and, antibiotic now.  I know I’ll get crap for it but I’m getting the vaccine ASAP because this hasn’t done anything but make me MORE sick than I probably would have been with just Covid by itself!",SouthernBella93
4,Ivermectin,COVID-19,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 27, 2021",48,"My husband (48) & I (44) took Ivermectin trying to protect us from Covid.Side effects were AWFUL: stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea & my husband had really bad blurred vision & dizziness. He stopped taking it after 3 wks because of side effects.I hoped it would work better than it did, but we BOTH still got Covid 4 weeks after starting Ivermectin. My son, who refused to take Ivermectin since he was vaccinated for his job (mandated), didn’t get Covid although he is currently staying with us.I think it was all for nothing since we’re both still so sick after 16 days & my son didn’t have any of these side effects with his vaccine & also didn’t even get sick!Worth noting that the ER doc said my husband was already weak & dehydrated when he got Covid-19 since he’d been having diarrhea for weeks before, from the Ivermectin.I don’t recommend taking Ivermectin-It didn’t keep us from getting Covid & we are still really sick with Covid.",Virginia71
5,Ivermectin,COVID-19,10.0,,"August 27, 2021",104,"50yo female, 37yr smoker. I took ivermectin  on the day I tested positive for Covid and woke up the next day symptom free. My lungs did start congestion on day 7 but I was taking the ivermectin every 4th day so it kept it from going deep and I was fully recovered at two weeks. My husband also took it, 52yo 310lbs and he too knocked out symptoms using ivermectin every fourth day.  Both are fully recovered.",Anonymous
6,Ivermectin,COVID-19,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 25, 2021",76,"My husband & I did not take the vaccine but we are not high risk. We got on Ivermectin to hopefully keep us from getting the virus and we were both very hopeful since my neighbor said it worked & I read a lot about it online too. My daughter & grandkids visited first week of July & the day after they got back home they were diagnosed with Covid. July 12th, My husband and I also tested positive.BUT we were still taking the Ivermectin!!Thank God we survived & are finally doing better. I’m still really tired & having issues with my heart racing & dizzy spells, so I’m on leave from my part time job at my church. My husband got much sicker than I did but he survived, thank God. He is on oxygen still, but he’s out of the hospital after 25 days!I DO think IVERMECTIN helped us survive this horrible virus! It was EASY to take & while didn’t keep us from getting it & being very sick, it may have kept us from DYING as we know several that have died & they didn’t take it.",Barbara 1958
7,Ivermectin,COVID-19,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 15, 2021",136,"In February 2021 I was diagnosed with Covid later turning into pneumonia. Most recently the pneumonia has completely taken over my life I can’t talk, walk or eat without great difficulty because I cannot breathe. The pulmonologist I was seeing just put me on prednisone which hardly did a thing. I went back to my primary who put me on dexamethasone and Ivermectin and within two weeks, two weeks I could breathe again I only wish I went to my doctor sooner. I am thankful for my primary care physician and the ivermectin.",LEHop
