0,Ceftriaxone,Joint Infection,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 28, 2019",3,I was bitten by my cat and ended up in the hospital for 6 days with an infection in the wound.  I was put on ceftriazone through IV.  I was then sent home with a  PICC line and I was giving myself this medicine intravenously for 15 more days.  I suffered through some side effects and now I have to get treated for Clostridium difficile which is caused by long term IV antibiotic treatment.  The jury is still out on how effective it is.,Smokeyfiat911
