0,Metronidazole,Joint Infection,2,,"September 1, 2019",3,Was put on Flagyl for two weeks since last Sunday 250 mg 3 times a day.  That Gastro doctor said that would help my bloating and he thought I had a bacterial infection in my stomach.  I never did blood work and I was supposed to take his word for this.   He put me on medication called Bentyl  too which slows down the muscles in my stomach lining and helps with digestion with people that have IBS.  My new Gastro doctor said that I should be able to take it at a lower dose 10 mg.   Then he proceeds to tell me it would better to take pill twice a day but then the kidney doctor says oh no she can’t.  Kidney doctor said OK take it when you have symptoms.   My symptoms are every day.   I got off of Flagyl just today. I could not handle the pill bad side effects   I’m going to give it a few more days and then I’m going back on Bentyl.,Ann
