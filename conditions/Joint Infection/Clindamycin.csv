0,Clindamycin,Joint Infection,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 5, 2021",3,"I had a jaw infection and was prescribed clindamycin 300mg dose 3 times a day. Now, I need to add that I have GERD and ulcers but I'm pretty much allergic to everything else so I take this. Now the trick, that helps me anyway, ALWAYS EAT WHEN TAKING IT. I eat 3/4 of my meal. Then take the antibiotic with a full glass of water then I finish my meal to make sure the pills don't stay stuck in the throat. Then I sit up for half hour to an hour. This helps me not get heartburn! This is a great antibiotic and works rather quickly but make sure you take it with food or u will be up with miserable heartburn and vomiting all over the place.",Dianea79
