0,Naltrexone,Opiate Dependence,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 6, 2022",0,Vivitrol (naltrexone):Getting the vivitrol shot was the worst thing that could have happened to me . Before getting the vivitrol shot I was two years sober from opiates and thought I was ready to get off and stay off suboxone.  I was wrong . After getting the vivitrol shot I became severely depressed. The most depressed I’ve ever been in years and as the month went on it got worse. On top of that it didn’t help whatsoever with my cravings. If anything my cravings returned after being gone for two years. I hear vivitrol helps a lot of people but I’m one of those people it didn’t . The severe depression caused me to relapse after 2 years sober towards the end of the month once the shot wore off.  Now I’m back to day one and getting back on suboxone and going to rehab. Just know depression is one of the main side effects of vivitrol . Be careful,Cass

I took it the night it was filled and it worked the night... because the side effects were so terrible I couldn't think of anything else. I kept having diarrhea, vomiting, constant dizziness, just an odd feeling of being foggy/me not actually being within my self. I took this for 6 days but I am going to stop and not continue tonight.

It is amazing because I always craved it even after being sober. It seems even Suboxone kept me craving stuff but now I couldn't care less about it.I only take about 6 mg /day and it still works.

I was accidentally sent into early withdrawal on suboxone, and given 2 days of Valium to get through the worst of my withdrawal off of heroin, and fentanyl. I spent 7 days at the facility completely sober before getting my injection. While it felt uncomfortable being administered, I have not had any adverse reactions to it, and it’s greatly helped with the cravings. I’m a healthy 26 year old female and this injection has given me a chance to save my life. I’ll only continue it the first 90 days in order to give myself time to begin to feel better and stand on my own. Recovery is possible!

I was all stretchy constantly,  which was not really that big of a deal.  But you know what was a big deal?  The sexual malaise,  or complete decimation of my libido.  At first,  I orgasmed extremely quick, then no orgasms no matter how hard I tried.  It was hard on my relationship.  If I wanted to not feel,  I would have stayed on dope.  Second side effect I have is this: it's been just about 30 days,  and ALL I want to do now is eat.  I guess this is because my receptors can take dopamine again?  The food is just SO amazing I am pretty much obsessed with it.  I am actually grateful to have had the thirty days to start creating new habits of not using.  The most messed up thing is that trying to ask healthcare providers about these side effects (very specifically) elicited such evasive answers and denial of the facts that are clearly on Vivitrol's own website.",None

I became addicted to opiates 35 years ago and have tried every kind of treatment imaginable over the years. I used again after 6 months on methadone and only 3 months on suboxone. But Vivitrol works differently. Whereas the older medications kept me in active addiction due to causing euphoria and physical dependence, Vivitrol does not cause either of these. Vivitrol decreases my cravings and blocks the effects of opioids. Addicts won't spend there money on opiates while taking Vivitrol because they know they can't get high.

But I was so depressed and lethargic from the shot I couldn't bear to stay on it any longer than a month. By day 25 the vivitrol depression was lifting and I started to feel normal again. You have to weigh the pros and cons of the shot. Nobody talks about how Vivitrol blocks the heroin from entering your opiate receptors. But it also blocks the natural production of serotonin and dopamine from entering these receptors as well. Vivitrol cannot differentiate between the two. It's a proven fact and I know  from experience. But the makers of the shot don't want you too know this. In the end I have a love and hate relationship with Vivitrol. It gave me the time to heal .

Methadone and Suboxone/Subutex didn’t help me at all. My cravings on those drugs were still out of control and I still couldn’t stop using. I got almost 2 years clean in a 12 step program then had a year long relapse. After detox I started vivitrol and rejoined the 12 step community and I’m doing great. I’ve had no cravings and pairing recovery with vivitrol I’ve had no obsession to use. No side effects either. My mood is fine no injection site problem just slightly sore the first day.

Upon seeing his new psych in outpatient he warned my son about the dangers of Vivitrol to your liver and would only agree to give him one more shot maybe two after the initial shot. He had two shots total after rehab and is doing amazingly well. If you want to remain sober you have to have the mindset to stay sober. The least amount of time you are on this medication the better.

Roughly 90-120mgs per day and using suboxone a few days a week when I couldn't afford the pills. The people who are feeding you these nightmare precipitated withdrawal stories are getting the shot with opiates still in their system. Obviously, the more and longer you use, the longer it may take for you to get completely opiate free. But 10-14 days is long enough for nearly anybody. Just have the Doctor give you the challenge with Naloxone before he gives you the vivitrol. If you have no reaction you'll be good",Percolator

Before this shot my kids only worry was their next high. Today they are enjoying life as college students! We tried  other options like Suboxone & Zubsolve as well as several rehabs. It always ended after 60 or 90 days with relapse. This shot has allowed my 2 youngest (19 & 21) a chance at a real life. They tell me they have no cravings & the best part is that its not a daily choice to take a medicine. They only have to make the decision 1x a month.  Of course they are using the Vivitrol along with A LOT of counseling. The hardest part for the addict is to stay clean the 7 days prior.,happy mama

I have been clean from all opiates for 18 months now. The turn around I've made in my life is remarkable. Medication used to treat addiction is tricky, because it will not work unless the patient truly wants to get clean. Nothing will stop an addict who wants to use from using.

It was do-able I was terrified but I promise it's possible. Once I had the shot I felt like myself again no cravings. Only side effect I had was a tiny little bit of soreness at injection site. Other than that I felt NO SIDE EFFECTS at all. Zero. That was my experience, my advise if you proceed with this is make sure you find a doctor who knows what they are doing, it makes a difference.
