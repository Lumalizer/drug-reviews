0,Vivitrol,Opiate Dependence,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 6, 2022",0,Getting the vivitrol shot was the worst thing that could have happened to me . Before getting the vivitrol shot I was two years sober from opiates and thought I was ready to get off and stay off suboxone.  I was wrong . After getting the vivitrol shot I became severely depressed. The most depressed I’ve ever been in years and as the month went on it got worse. On top of that it didn’t help whatsoever with my cravings. If anything my cravings returned after being gone for two years. I hear vivitrol helps a lot of people but I’m one of those people it didn’t . The severe depression caused me to relapse after 2 years sober towards the end of the month once the shot wore off.  Now I’m back to day one and getting back on suboxone and going to rehab. Just know depression is one of the main side effects of vivitrol . Be careful,Cass

The next 2 weeks brutal depression, couldn't work, suicidal thoughts. I tried H for the first few days, nothing happened so gave up. Soon after I felt normal no cravings. I stayed on it for 6 months. saved my life for sure. Stayed clean 3 years! Then relapsed during COVID so I just did another 7 day rapid detox and today is day 2 after the shot and I can't get out of bed. But I know a few days of this is expected, the feeling of ice cream inside my bones is the worst part. And all the other side effects I think are just from no opioids. I have ED, oh well.

5,Vivitrol,Opiate Dependence,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 29, 2021",1,"I received the Vivitrol injection after 12 days of being in a treatment center. I was accidentally sent into early withdrawal on suboxone, and given 2 days of Valium to get through the worst of my withdrawal off of heroin, and fentanyl. I spent 7 days at the facility completely sober before getting my injection. While it felt uncomfortable being administered, I have not had any adverse reactions to it, and it’s greatly helped with the cravings. I’m a healthy 26 year old female and this injection has given me a chance to save my life. I’ll only continue it the first 90 days in order to give myself time to begin to feel better and stand on my own. Recovery is possible! It’s intense though so if you’re still having reservations about using, avoid or it can make you sick.",IndigoMoon

Couldn’t eat for 5 days. CONSTANT SEVERE BLOOD PRESSURE INCREASE. I thought it was due to detox but NOW I know that I am allergic to this injection. I immediately had to go on HIGH doses of blood pressure meds in order to not have heart attack/ stroke. The symptoms are STILL here 25 days after injection. Night sweats, insomnia, SEVERE DEPRESSION. This was the WORST DECISION I HAVE EVER MADE. And LIFE THREATENING- Pulled medical records past 5 years NEVER HAD HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. I paid $30K to go the best medically induced opiate detox then stay at million dollar home with staff. I had to stay 3 extra days while others would leave completely fine 4 days earlier. I was the sickest. I have EVER been. In one week lost 26lbs, no sleep, high blood pressure, extreme fatigue. IM JUST PRAYING ALL THESE HORRIFIC- Side Effects go away soon.

And let's talk about the depression -  I've never been so depressed In my life and I already have depression but it got so bad I would just lay in bed and cry.

They said it was post acute withdrawal but it's full blown and miserable. Day 7 and I'm literally just surviving on clonidine and gabapentin mainly. I'm weak shake and miserable.

12,Vivitrol,Opiate Dependence,4.0,,"January 24, 2020",18,"The first day on Vivitrol I felt only what I could describe as peace.  But then,  the insomnia kicked in.  I was all stretchy constantly,  which was not really that big of a deal.  But you know what was a big deal?  The sexual malaise,  or complete decimation of my libido.  At first,  I orgasmed extremely quick, then no orgasms no matter how hard I tried.  It was hard on my relationship.  If I wanted to not feel,  I would have stayed on dope.  Second side effect I have is this: it's been just about 30 days,  and ALL I want to do now is eat.  I guess this is because my receptors can take dopamine again?  The food is just SO amazing I am pretty much obsessed with it.  I am actually grateful to have had the thirty days to start creating new habits of not using.  The most messed up thing is that trying to ask healthcare providers about these side effects (very specifically) elicited such evasive answers and denial of the facts that are clearly on Vivitrol's own website.",None

I got the Vivatrol shot because I have to stop getting high. All of my friends that have gone to rehab then used Vivatrol have all stayed clean. I believe the longest one  is 4 years sober. I get dropped by my PO once a week. So yeah at this point I have to stay clean, or go back to prison. I know it's only been 2 days but I feel like my cravings have stopped. I'm also going to do an IOP along with the shot. I need all the help I can get. I'm definitely not having any bad side effects.

I plan on taking vivitrol until my insurance will not cover it anymore.

23,Vivitrol,Opiate Dependence,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 1, 2019",28,"I started Vivitrol injections 2 years ago and have been clean ever since! I became addicted to opiates 35 years ago and have tried every kind of treatment imaginable over the years. I used again after 6 months on methadone and only 3 months on suboxone. But Vivitrol works differently. Whereas the older medications kept me in active addiction due to causing euphoria and physical dependence, Vivitrol does not cause either of these. Vivitrol decreases my cravings and blocks the effects of opioids. Addicts won't spend there money on opiates while taking Vivitrol because they know they can't get high. It's been a life saver for me, and in my opinion, it's far superior to the older medications.",KC

Got on the shot. 100% blocks heroin, also blocked cocaine for me even though most people say it won't. Took ecstasy once with it and had  a severely bad reaction. Still could drink alcohol and smoke pot normally. Did 1 year on the shot and after the first 2 months stopped trying to find my way around the block. Physically it kept me sober but mentally I am still just as much of a junkie. I have been off the dang shot for 7 weeks now and it is still in my system!

26,Vivitrol,Opiate Dependence,7.0,,"August 20, 2019",35,"Vivitrol is a life saver for sure but the mental aspects such as the depression, lethargy, lack of motivation, gastro problems are all really side effects.  But I was so depressed and lethargic from the shot I couldn't bear to stay on it any longer than a month. By day 25 the vivitrol depression was lifting and I started to feel normal again. You have to weigh the pros and cons of the shot. Nobody talks about how Vivitrol blocks the heroin from entering your opiate receptors. But it also blocks the natural production of serotonin and dopamine from entering these receptors as well. Vivitrol cannot differentiate between the two. It's a proven fact and I know  from experience. But the makers of the shot don't want you too know this. In the end I have a love and hate relationship with Vivitrol. It gave me the time to heal . But the depression and lethargy the shot causes I wouldn't wish it on everyone.",Maximus
27,Vivitrol,Opiate Dependence,,,"August 7, 2019",44,"So I was on suboxone for almost 5 years . It helped get my life together but created a barrier for moving forward. I grew stagnant , just doing well enough in life to stay afloat. I kept  the mediocre job , the small apartment and ""ok"" life. I'm staying humble through this time. I made the decision to get off the subs and chose vivitrol. At first the withdrawals from the subs were bad then I started getting better. My doctor ""suggested"" I get the vivitrol shot and I knew that would be a good decision. I didn't want to feel horrible like I did on the subs, I wanted pure sobriety. So I jumped on the idea without hesitation. I'm 2 shots in now and I feel as though I'm still in withdrawal. I will definitely not be getting another shot. I'm certain its because of the shot at this point . Over 2 months feeling like this??? I'm writing this hopefully to help someone going through the same thing . If you still feel pain, aches , insomnia, general dissatisfaction with life , it might be the vivitrol.",Monty
28,Vivitrol,Opiate Dependence,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 19, 2019",40,I couldn't stop using dope for the life of me.  Literally. I used within 24 hours of getting the vivitrol shot.  My doctor knew but he also knew if he didn't get it into me I would keep using and die.  I had two days of intense withdrawal.  Worse than I'd ever had. Then about five more days of laziness and being agitated. But once your mind finally gives up and comes to terms that you can't get high you calm down.  The hustle stops.  This was my only option to stop. Feeling like death for two days was worth the lifelong nightmare I was pursuing,Hobbit

This is not my first rodeo, I was sober 15 months through AA, before I relapsed and got on shit after a treatment center. This is not normal for me and the only thing that's different in my life is I was on the shot and now I'm not. I recommend it for someone struggling being sober is better than dying from the disease.

32,Vivitrol,Opiate Dependence,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 9, 2019",20,I’m having an amazing experience with Vivitrol. I was an opiate addict for almost 15 years. Methadone and Suboxone/Subutex didn’t help me at all. My cravings on those drugs were still out of control and I still couldn’t stop using. I got almost 2 years clean in a 12 step program then had a year long relapse. After detox I started vivitrol and rejoined the 12 step community and I’m doing great. I’ve had no cravings and pairing recovery with vivitrol I’ve had no obsession to use. No side effects either. My mood is fine no injection site problem just slightly sore the first day. Also unlike methadone or Suboxone vivitrol is 12 step friendly. Hope this helps someone.,AyGi

39,Vivitrol,Opiate Dependence,10.0,,"November 9, 2018",29,"I was drinking a lot everyday and taken about 20 to 30 dros a day plus other things. I woke up one day and decided that I needed to do something about it before I ended up dead. It was hard to do, my wife had no idea for the last 14 years I was an addict. That first thing I did was come clean with her which was the hardest thing to do when you spend so much time covering your tracks. It's hard to humble yourself and come clean but that is the first step. After that I had to be clean for five to seven days before I could get vivitrol. Days before I got the shot I remember siting in the living room in tears wondering if I'll ever be right. But getting the shot is the best move it does not hurt bad at all it's like a flu shot and all of this about no energy and what not I did not experience. I felt great the night I got it I had more energy and more of an appetite. It has now been two months and I have not had a drink or any opioids.

44,Vivitrol,Opiate Dependence,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 10, 2018",10,I was an addict for 20 years. Mainly opiates. I decided to seek help and got into a mat program that provides Vivitrol injections for free and Intensive outpatient programs (IOP). That's awesome and everything because I've been wanting to be on Vivitrol for a year at least but I didn't think it was possible because I didn't have insurance. So I went through the whole withdrawal process because you have to be clean to get the shot and then when I got the shot I thought everything was going to be great. I was wrong. The first five days I could not eat or sleep. After that I have been feeling a lot better but my anxiety has been out the roof. And the injection site still hurts sometimes even after 3 weeks. Next week I'm due to get my second shot and I'm hoping it will be better. It kind of seemed like I was on chemo because the first 5 days after the shot had such terrible side effects.,Steph
45,Vivitrol,Opiate Dependence,10.0,,"March 31, 2018",23,I’m As a combat vet I ended up inpatient treatment at the VA. At first I was prescribed suboxone. Suboxone worked well while I was in inpatient. After treatment I relapsed and quickly fell. It got to a point quickly that I didn’t want to live anymore. I went back to the same inpatient treatment.  I had 3 options Methodone (pushes the opiate receptor 100%). Suboxone (push’s it slightly). Vivitrol-blocks the receptor for a month. I tried vivitrol. I can tell you being 8 months sober that it is amazing. It is not just the medicine. Number one: is the desire to change. Number 2:-the knowledge I received through the VA.

Both methadone and buprenorphine are long acting opiates. When a medical professional tells you that you need to stay clean for 5-7 days, they are speaking of short acting opiates. Heroin, OC, OP, OHC, and I'm sure the other codeine derivatives have a much shorter half-life (a measure of how long they stay in your body) than do methadone and buprenorphine. If you are trying to switch from one of the long acting opiates to the naltrexone shot, personally I would switch to a shorter acting opiate for two week, then stay clean off the for 4-5 days, and then get the shot.

I've now had 4 Vivitrol injections and gotta say, it's worked wonders. The first injection, as I said, caused migraines, vomiting, and stomach cramps. Every injection I've recieved since has been good. No symptoms whatsoever, only positive results. I've been clean since November 17th of 2015. This shot is truly a lifesaver, my cravings are less frequent and very short lived. I reccomend this shot to anyone struggling with opioid dependency.

The reason I give it a so so rating is because it does nothing for your urges and cravings. That's a battle you still have to fight on your own. After my first injection I experienced ""brain fog"", rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure for the next 24 hours. I was 14 days clean prior to the injection. The next 4 injections went smooth.
