0,Probuphine,Opiate Dependence,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 13, 2019",20,"I spent half my adult life addicted to opiates.  Every effort, every treatment, every commitment failed.  Probuphine is the only treatment that worked long term.  I was able to immediately have a normal life without cravings, or worrying about Suboxone regimens.  It works, it saved my life.",Cleanliving

2,Probuphine,Opiate Dependence,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 13, 2018",22,"This is an amazing drug. Suboxone was like a miracle drug for me but I always felt like it's effects would wear off prior to the next dose. On Probuphine I feel completely normal, don't have cravings, don't have those fluctuations in feeling it's effects. I don't ever feel it's effects- just feel normal. My mood has been good, sleeping well, and it has been handling my chronic pain okay so far. Maybe the greatest thing is not having to deal with the pharmacy every few weeks. That always stressed me out. Now, medication is just always there! It's awesome!",Lola
