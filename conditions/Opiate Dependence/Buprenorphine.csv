Then I just got addicted and dependent so I went to a suboxone clinic. Was on Suboxone strips for about 2 years (3strips) a day. I couldn't handle the taste of the strips or the pills so I would spit it out early never being able to ingest my full daily dose. The doctor told me there was an injection so after battling with insurance companies I finally got approved. I've been on the 300mg dose every month. I'm now been on the sublocade injection for a full year (12 injections) and I've never looked back. it also is good for pain management even tho they say it's not meant for that. I am so grateful I have insurance,  and that there is an injection medication like this that's fully covered.  I'm blessed.

In that time I tried to quit a few times and had so bad withdraws that I couldn't quit while I was working and had severe restless leg syndrome. To make a long story short, I'm on 4 months with nothing after sublocade for 4 months then I stopped to see what will happen.  I thank God every day I go without and drug use.  I hope I never need anything like suboxone or sublocade again. If your done with taken any drug to get high including pot or alcohol, this will take you there without being sick or withdrawing",Bill

The subs made a bunch of my hair fall out plus going to the pharmacy daily in my ritzy neighbourhood stressed me out so I’d use coke more. The dr offered Sublocade so I gave it a try. Everything seems great and all. I’ve had my 2 months of 300mg and 3rd month of 100mg. Now what? I am due for my next shot or what idk? I don’t want to keep taking stuff. I wish I could stop. I am terrified of withdrawals and it says you may have them but not for weeks to months after. Well I am going on the reviews I guess and wish me luck.

After 4 years it became apparent that I wasn't going to be able to come off Suboxone without awful withdrawals so I figured I was stuck on it for life. Then I heard about the Sublocade injection from a friend. I figured I had nothing to lose. So far I have had 2, 300mg shots and I feel great. No withdrawal, no cravings. I just feel normal again. My next injection is supposed to be 100mg but at this point I'm holding off to see if I'll even need it. The only side effects I've experienced from Sublocade are sleeplessness the day of the injection and some discomfort at the injection site for a few days. Also constipation which I'm used to from the Suboxone anyway. If you are looking to break the daily habit of needing to take something Sublocade is absolutely the way to go.

Allowed me to keep a full time job. But in saying that, being on the program is a pain in the ass. Having to go to the chemist 5 times a week. Running into all the addicts. Just still being dependant on a drug. Swapping to sublocade. Or buvidal in aus. Was the best thing I did. Holds you better and for longer than my 24mg sub. And I found I lost the dependency of having to go to the chemist every day. 9 months on buvidale, starting on 128mg.

Dosage varied during those years but was usually around 16-24mg/day. My decision to try sublocade was only to get off the medicine. My Dr said people weren't feeling withdrawals coming off the medicine because it gradually tapers down over a few months. So, I got the first and last injection on July 2nd. 4 months later, I'm doing great and I haven't felt bad really at all during those 4 months.

I've used drugs for 11 years between here, Dubai, Nyc. I have done almost every single drug but of course when it came to heroin that was my drug of choice. I've been in and out of rehabs a lot, I've attended many NA meetings.. I've done Subs before and stopped. Now I'm back. It has been like 5 month back on a 3 daily 8mg Buprenorphine. I'm not going to lie and say I'm not abusing it.. But the thing about this whole opioid substitute is ""a cover-up"". The main differences is that its legal and you don't have to pick up from a dealer. My opinion is that people have made it seem like that. Thats the whole messed up human being perspective. You're still using if you think about it. I'm not even trying to stop it cause of how bad the withdrawals are. I guess that is me an addict. To whoever is reading this! Lebanon is way too different than what you think or see. So many addicts",Abbasios

I have been stable for many years and have noticed that different batches of subutex can be slightly different but this last batch, b.n 023103 is the worst. I feel so bad I even feel like quitting my job as it has been a huge struggle for 2 months. My symptoms are like withdrawals I can function but its very hard, I haven't used in many years. Trying to get help is almost impossible so had to contact indivior myself which was not easy. Now I'm hopefully getting a different batch sent to my pharmacy but will they be better and how long will the batch last I don't know. Have tried generic sandoz but in the past they were inferior to subutex. Don't be fooled into thinking all buprenorphine is made the same.

18,Buprenorphine,Opiate Dependence,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 18, 2021",3,Sublocade (buprenorphine):If u guys are wondering if u should get the Sublocade injection do it!!! I myself was addicted to Heroin for 15 years. I literally wish I would have found out about the sublocade injection sooner. I have tried everything I've been to 12 different methadone clinics 10 rehabs and literally tried everything to get clean. After hitting bottom I got on suboxone and decided I was going to get my life back. After being on the subs awhile my dr at the clinic told me about the sublocade shot. Decided to give it a try got the first 300mg shot 4 months ago. Went back a month later got another 300mg shot.  I've literally had no withdrawals at all. It’s been 4 months since I got my first shot I got two 300mg shots and one 100 mg shot and I’m not going back to get my 4th I’m ready to be free from all substances and have my life back. The sublocade injection works and stays in your system for a very long time so there should be no reason for u to get any withdrawal symptoms after stopping the shot. Good Luck!!!,Honest Review
19,Buprenorphine,Opiate Dependence,9.0,,"September 18, 2021",5,"Sublocade (buprenorphine):I’ve had a 25 yr Heroin addiction, including a lot of benzos, pills etc. So basically whatever Gear, pills I could get my hands on, I did it! I was trying to deal with my demons by trying to numb my pain with heroin & other drugs, injecting whatever. Finding a vein in the morning, arvo & night. Long term USING! Not many veins left after using that long! It was a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly habit - a big habit. So to put it bluntly YES SUBLOCADE WORKS AMAZINGLY. I’ve tried & been on Methadone, Suboxone, Buprenorphine & as I said also taking a shit load of pills while having a 25yr DRUG addiction. NOW NO MORE CHEMICAL HANDCUFFS!! And now so good waking up not having to go to the chemist. So if anyone out there wants to get clean AND ARE READY TO!! Go & get the WONDER SUBLOCADE because for me & my long term addiction it is excellent! IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE LIKE YOU WONT BELIEVE!!",Jay

I never had to adjust my dose with the strips.. but now I want off of everything.  I have read so many testimonials about others who stopped taking Sublocade with no side effects.  I'm thinking its because it leaves your body at a slow rate and you possibly dont have to go through withdrawal. Maybe some but not as severe as stopping strips as  I did that and the withdrawal was horrible.  Now I had a injection 2 weeks ago with no plans of having another. I want my life back because I used it for pain control due to a broken back and neck. The testimonials I read about others who have no withdrawal experience is so super exciting for me. I believe them. WHY WOULD THEY LIE!!! I will keep you posted about progress. But scientifically..  it must me true because its leaving your body at a slow rate... hence no symptoms.. slow maybe slow symptoms.. but  not vicious symptoms, so easy enough to push through..

I didn’t think much of it. So, here I was taking 2-3 strips a day, and I just began to get fed up taking this medication again and again. I finally reached out to a doctor a few miles away and I went and got it ordered. It took 2 weeks to arrive. Getting the injection, I was told be prepared it does sting. I’m laying on my back and he counts 3..2..1 and the medicine starts going. For 4 seconds I said wow this is not bad, when I hit 5 seconds, I felt it. It BURNED NICELY.  Like a good sting for a good amount of time. I just received it Tuesday and wow. I feel incredible. Never am I coming down, or feeling as up as I was. I’m just at a steady dose of 10 mg. Absolutely no withdrawal effects. I sleep great at night, and I wake up feeling fantastic. It still does sting at times and I have a bump where the injection took place. Positive reviews on this.

After serving 5 years in prison I had all intentions of getting on suboxone and I went for my evaluation and the counsellor doing it mentioned sublocade. I'd never heard of it, hence I was in prison for 5 years. So I decided to give I a try. 14 months later and no injection for the past 5 months, I'm still clean. Now I also went through the IOP and regular outpatient which helped as well. And I also completely cut off everyone. And when I say everyone I mean everyone. I've stayed busy working and just keeping myself busy. But with out sublocade I wouldn't be where I'm at today. This is the longest I've ever remained clean and I feel amazing.

Unfortunately, the process for actually receiving the medication is extremely devastating.  Getting this medication, for my husband, required MONTHS of spending HOURS a day on the phone with insurance companies, specialty pharmacies and various financial aid programs.  Each party involved came with their own set of specific guidelines, human error, delays and issues.  This medication could eliminate the opiate epidemic.  To receive this life saving medication, a person requires an advocate who is able and willing to dedicate months of their life towards getting a medication.

The actual shot was painful and burned but it subsided in a couple mins.  You get the shot in your stomach and it becomes an aching pain instead of burning and the location will be sore for about 4 days.  Don't be scared of the shot it is a fleeting and temporary pain...worrying about having enough meds to last the month will not be a problem anymore.  I no longer have to worry about taking the right amount of meds. It's much easier for me this way. Now I don't feel like I have to take a pill to feel ok.

I took 2 films and, no doubt about it, I had a significant amount of bupe in my system. Slept really good that first night, and when I woke up I could tell that I'd woken up with a good amount of bupe already in my system. And this matches clinical trials data that 'Tmax', following first injection, is at about 24 hours -- i.e., an initial peak in plasma bupe levels occurs about 24 hours after the initial injection.

It takes my cravings and withdrawal symptoms completely away, my use was about 150mg ocycodone a day. Yes it does have a pretty nasty withdrawal itself when stopped. It's less intense but last far longer then oxy withdrawals. Low and slow is the name of the game. Take your time on reducing dosage and go as low as possible.
