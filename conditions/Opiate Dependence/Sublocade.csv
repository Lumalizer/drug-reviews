1,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,,,"March 8, 2022",0,Well I was on Methadone for 14 year's and was terrified to come of coz of the withdrawal symptoms but on Dec 11th 2021 I went on the Buvidal injection. Took the 1 week one then the monthly one after and didn't go back to my addiction worker. Had not one withdrawal. It sure is a miracle drug.,Anonymous
2,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 5, 2022",0,"I have been on pain meds half my life. Then I just got addicted and dependent so I went to a suboxone clinic. Was on Suboxone strips for about 2 years (3strips) a day. I couldn't handle the taste of the strips or the pills so I would spit it out early never being able to ingest my full daily dose. The doctor told me there was an injection so after battling with insurance companies I finally got approved. I've been on the 300mg dose every month. I'm now been on the sublocade injection for a full year (12 injections) and I've never looked back. it also is good for pain management even tho they say it's not meant for that. I am so grateful I have insurance,  and that there is an injection medication like this that's fully covered.  I'm blessed. Please don't take anything for granted,  especially in today's world.",Justin
3,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 28, 2022",0,"I've waited to comment to see what happened to me taking this after being on suboxone for over 10 years.  In that time I tried to quit a few times and had so bad withdraws that I couldn't quit while I was working and had severe restless leg syndrome. To make a long story short, I'm on 4 months with nothing after sublocade for 4 months then I stopped to see what will happen.  I thank God every day I go without and drug use.  I hope I never need anything like suboxone or sublocade again. If your done with taken any drug to get high including pot or alcohol, this will take you there without being sick or withdrawing",Bill

The people who die coming off it aren't posting here.  My daughter died after taking Sublocade for two years and stopping for 3 months.  Her cravings got so bad, she relapsed and was killed by fentanyl.  Sublocade buys you time but it does not treat the underling addiction.",Dr. Big Vic
5,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 15, 2022",1,Was addicted to smoking fentanyl and tried methadone and suboxone. The subs made a bunch of my hair fall out plus going to the pharmacy daily in my ritzy neighbourhood stressed me out so I’d use coke more. The dr offered Sublocade so I gave it a try. Everything seems great and all. I’ve had my 2 months of 300mg and 3rd month of 100mg. Now what? I am due for my next shot or what idk? I don’t want to keep taking stuff. I wish I could stop. I am terrified of withdrawals and it says you may have them but not for weeks to months after. Well I am going on the reviews I guess and wish me luck. I wish I could talk to someone to see just seems too good to be true but here I go. Not going back. I hope. I’ll come back in a few months to report,Stacey519
6,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,,,"February 5, 2022",2,"I've been on suboxone for over 10 years and the withdraws so bad I couldn't quit, they were terrible.  I have been on sublocade for 4 months and caught covid and couldn't go back to get my shot and noticed I wasn't withdrawing, so I didn't go back and get my shot.  It has been over 2 months now and I'm going to continue to try and stop everything for good.  I hope this works but so far I'm doing good and hope this is it.",Bill
7,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 5, 2022",1,"I was an opiate user for 20 years prior to beginning Suboxone treatment in 2017. After 4 years it became apparent that I wasn't going to be able to come off Suboxone without awful withdrawals so I figured I was stuck on it for life. Then I heard about the Sublocade injection from a friend. I figured I had nothing to lose. So far I have had 2, 300mg shots and I feel great. No withdrawal, no cravings. I just feel normal again. My next injection is supposed to be 100mg but at this point I'm holding off to see if I'll even need it. The only side effects I've experienced from Sublocade are sleeplessness the day of the injection and some discomfort at the injection site for a few days. Also constipation which I'm used to from the Suboxone anyway. If you are looking to break the daily habit of needing to take something Sublocade is absolutely the way to go. It has literally given me my life back!",Kat82

It has been over 3 months since my last injection and I have had no withdrawals. A little achy here snd there but nothing I can’t handle. It’s been a lifesaver I would highly recommended,Addicted
9,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,2.0,,"December 31, 2021",2,"I've been on Suboxone off and on for the past 6 or 7 years.  My doctor talked me into trying Sublocade. I was so grateful and agreed.  The first day was fine.   Each day after has been horrible.  Withdrawal symptoms.. you never forget how it feels.   So when the other doc called and said maybe it's a virus, that really annoyed me.   Anyone have Sublocade not work out?  I was soo hopeful for this.  Now what... when I did get the shot they said it was oozing out.   I specifically asked..what if I didn't get enough?!  You did.   You'll be fine they said.  I'm not fine.  Luckily I have Lucemyra to help.",Mel
10,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,10.0,,"December 3, 2021",2,"I was on suboxone for 6 years. 24 mg daily after having a terrible heroin habit. Suboxone gave me a life back. Allowed me to keep a full time job. But in saying that, being on the program is a pain in the ass. Having to go to the chemist 5 times a week. Running into all the addicts. Just still being dependant on a drug. Swapping to sublocade. Or buvidal in aus. Was the best thing I did. Holds you better and for longer than my 24mg sub. And I found I lost the dependency of having to go to the chemist every day. 9 months on buvidale, starting on 128mg. Now I am 2 weeks through my last 64mg dose to come clean and I tell you what I don't even feel the muscle cramps. Nothing. I've heard it is easy to come off. And I believe at this stage cause I feel great.",Scotty

12,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2021",2,"I decided to try sublocade after being on Subutex for about 4 years. Dosage varied during those years but was usually around 16-24mg/day. My decision to try sublocade was only to get off the medicine. My Dr said people weren't feeling withdrawals coming off the medicine because it gradually tapers down over a few months. So, I got the first and last injection on July 2nd. 4 months later, I'm doing great and I haven't felt bad really at all during those 4 months. Sublocade has been the greatest blessing for me after opiates ruined a decade of my life. I am finally off of all of it and I feel 1000x times better.",Shepps1224
13,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 18, 2021",3,If u guys are wondering if u should get the Sublocade injection do it!!! I myself was addicted to Heroin for 15 years. I literally wish I would have found out about the sublocade injection sooner. I have tried everything I've been to 12 different methadone clinics 10 rehabs and literally tried everything to get clean. After hitting bottom I got on suboxone and decided I was going to get my life back. After being on the subs awhile my dr at the clinic told me about the sublocade shot. Decided to give it a try got the first 300mg shot 4 months ago. Went back a month later got another 300mg shot.  I've literally had no withdrawals at all. It’s been 4 months since I got my first shot I got two 300mg shots and one 100 mg shot and I’m not going back to get my 4th I’m ready to be free from all substances and have my life back. The sublocade injection works and stays in your system for a very long time so there should be no reason for u to get any withdrawal symptoms after stopping the shot. Good Luck!!!,Honest Review
14,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,9.0,,"September 18, 2021",5,"I’ve had a 25 yr Heroin addiction, including a lot of benzos, pills etc. So basically whatever Gear, pills I could get my hands on, I did it! I was trying to deal with my demons by trying to numb my pain with heroin & other drugs, injecting whatever. Finding a vein in the morning, arvo & night. Long term USING! Not many veins left after using that long! It was a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly habit - a big habit. So to put it bluntly YES SUBLOCADE WORKS AMAZINGLY. I’ve tried & been on Methadone, Suboxone, Buprenorphine & as I said also taking a shit load of pills while having a 25yr DRUG addiction. NOW NO MORE CHEMICAL HANDCUFFS!! And now so good waking up not having to go to the chemist. So if anyone out there wants to get clean AND ARE READY TO!! Go & get the WONDER SUBLOCADE because for me & my long term addiction it is excellent! IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE LIKE YOU WONT BELIEVE!!",Jay
15,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,10.0,,"September 17, 2021",5,Sublocade has been a life saver. I got highly addicted to suboxone... I know it's crazy.... you can't abuse sublocade and you don't go through any withdrawal! I'm so grateful for this shot!!! I've had no side effects especially after being on suboxone for 13 yrs...  hope this helps!!,C.R.
16,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 13, 2021",6,"At first it was great for me.. I never had to adjust my dose with the strips.. but now I want off of everything.  I have read so many testimonials about others who stopped taking Sublocade with no side effects.  I'm thinking its because it leaves your body at a slow rate and you possibly dont have to go through withdrawal. Maybe some but not as severe as stopping strips as  I did that and the withdrawal was horrible.  Now I had a injection 2 weeks ago with no plans of having another. I want my life back because I used it for pain control due to a broken back and neck. The testimonials I read about others who have no withdrawal experience is so super exciting for me. I believe them. WHY WOULD THEY LIE!!! I will keep you posted about progress. But scientifically..  it must me true because its leaving your body at a slow rate... hence no symptoms.. slow maybe slow symptoms.. but  not vicious symptoms, so easy enough to push through.. I will post again as my progress continues",Anonymous
17,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,10.0,,"September 10, 2021",4,"Hello for anyone reading. I went to a meeting a month ago and someone told me about sublocade. I didn’t think much of it. So, here I was taking 2-3 strips a day, and I just began to get fed up taking this medication again and again. I finally reached out to a doctor a few miles away and I went and got it ordered. It took 2 weeks to arrive. Getting the injection, I was told be prepared it does sting. I’m laying on my back and he counts 3..2..1 and the medicine starts going. For 4 seconds I said wow this is not bad, when I hit 5 seconds, I felt it. It BURNED NICELY.  Like a good sting for a good amount of time. I just received it Tuesday and wow. I feel incredible. Never am I coming down, or feeling as up as I was. I’m just at a steady dose of 10 mg. Absolutely no withdrawal effects. I sleep great at night, and I wake up feeling fantastic. It still does sting at times and I have a bump where the injection took place. Positive reviews on this. If your thinking about it, GET IT!",Dave

Today I got my first sublocade shot, just felt like a bee sting and gone. I've read so many good things about it and I'm hoping in a few months to be completely finished with opiate based anything...whoo hoo!! Will post about how it goes. I would suggest this to anyone who wants to switch from subs, or wean off as I tried to with Suboxone but had a really difficult time. I want my life back. Good luck!!",Michelle Fuqua
19,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 23, 2021",3,"I was an active heroin user for about 20 years. In and out of rehabs. Spent 11 years in state prison and a few years on the revolving door of the county jail. After serving 5 years in prison I had all intentions of getting on suboxone and I went for my evaluation and the counsellor doing it mentioned sublocade. I'd never heard of it, hence I was in prison for 5 years. So I decided to give I a try. 14 months later and no injection for the past 5 months, I'm still clean. Now I also went through the IOP and regular outpatient which helped as well. And I also completely cut off everyone. And when I say everyone I mean everyone. I've stayed busy working and just keeping myself busy. But with out sublocade I wouldn't be where I'm at today. This is the longest I've ever remained clean and I feel amazing. I had no withdraw symptoms after not receiving anymore injections.  This is Def a miracle drug if you are ready. It Def takes some hard work and dedication to stay clean. Set boundaries and get the shot!!!",Nate

I used pills then fentonyl for 10 years, I tried  methadone then went got patches(fentonyl), I was deep, and I took TWO injections only to forget I needed a injection due to having my life back and once I was  told id need to restart (you need to take suboxone tablets for 7 days prior) I decided heck with it, its been 47 days (the max is 42 days before restart) ""I'm clean"", and with the passion and desire to be clean, I dropper those quotations soon after. I'm near 7 months clean now!!! I pray more people find this!!  If I could rate higher than 10 i WOULD!!!!",Anonymous
21,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 19, 2021",8,"This medication is lifesaving.  Unfortunately, the process for actually receiving the medication is extremely devastating.  Getting this medication, for my husband, required MONTHS of spending HOURS a day on the phone with insurance companies, specialty pharmacies and various financial aid programs.  Each party involved came with their own set of specific guidelines, human error, delays and issues.  This medication could eliminate the opiate epidemic.  To receive this life saving medication, a person requires an advocate who is able and willing to dedicate months of their life towards getting a medication.  Interesting how easily opiates are prescribed yet treatment for the repercussions are nearly impossible.  Lives would be saved if this medication were more accessible.",Anonymous

The first time I have been reading these reviews and a lot of them say they get lidocaine numbing injection before the Sublocade, but it doesn't even hurt, it just a little stings for a couple seconds so in my opinion it's not even worth sitting around waiting to get an extra lidocaine injection. As for Sublocade it has change my life. I have read other reviews online that  talk bad about that injection only after like  one or two. You have to stick with it. I feel normal.  I haven't felt this way in so many years and I'm so excited and happy I choose to be on the injection. game changer definitely",NW49ERSFAN
24,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,9.0,,"July 2, 2021",4,"Sublocade was a game changer. I was on oral meds for 4 months. I hated taking something every day so I could function. I would take extra if I was stressed, same behavior from when I used heroin. I was in sober living, working a NA program and still never felt ""clean"". I finally got my insurance to cover the injection. I read that it hurt. It did. I got a new DR who would use ice, inject lidocaine and THEN the sublocade. It helped DRASTICALLY. I also read about people getting a necrotic wound. I got one. My Dr suggested I go back to oral meds after it happened and I refused. I wasn't going back on tablets EVER again. I got my last shot after 22 months on sublocade. Hoping for no withdrawals after seeing so many others not have any. The painless detox is what brought me to sublocade in the beginning..My Dr said I needed to go back to tablets and taper but I refused. I'll for sure withdrawal from oral meds. I'll take my chances with just stopping the injection.",JD

I got the lidocaine injection a few minutes before to numb it and I felt nothing. I’m hoping to jump off after one or 2 or maybe even after the 100mg one which is the third. Tired of being on subs and feeling depressed and numb and angry and gaining weight and constipated and losing teeth thus awful drug!

28,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,9.0,,"April 13, 2021",12,"Got my first 300mg injection on 4/6/21. I've been on buprenorphine since October 11, 2010. So this October will be 11 years. 11 years of twice a month, or monthly appts, visits to the pharmacy, random counts and UA's. This medication I hope is what every addiction on maintainenance needs to get off. 24 hours after injection is the peak levels. I can attest that the first 2 days I felt amazing. Today is 1 week of not taking anything. Knowing I have a back up plan in case something comes up and I feel sick is keeping me calm. Today I feel a little more tired than usual. But nothing I can't push through! I will update again in a few weeks!But as of right now I am so glad I bucked up and did it. It certainly burns like anything going in, although it wasn't unbearable.

35,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,9.0,,"February 23, 2021",13,"I was opioid dependent for 20 years. Detoxed in jail. I made it 11 months in drug court before getting a positive UA. I only used 3 times in 11 months. I got the sublocade injection just so they wouldn't kick me out of the program. The next 5 months I received the typical two 300mg injections, then received three 100 mg injections, I'm graduating the program in 3 weeks, and haven't gotten the injection in 2 months. The studies I viewed found detectable bupe levels for up to 38 months after their last injection. So after you get a few shots you're good as far as withdrawals go for a long time, if ever. Idk how long the effectiveness against cravings last, but I'd guess its effective for months after your last one. I'd highly suggest anyone struggling with OUD to give sublocade a try, it works great, and you can't cheat the system or yourself by skipping doses to get high. You only have to think about it once every 30 days, so you are living a normal life 99.9% of the time. The injection does burn quite a bit, but its absolutely worth it !",JZ

I never woke up feeling like this, normal, on suboxone, until after I had taken a dosage. Now there are no ups and downs. I feel the same all the time, no matter what, thanks to the injection. I got on the injection because my husband was abusing part of my prescription of suboxone so in order for me to get out of this cycle, my doctor recommended the injection after I finally came clean about him. This way, no one can take advantage of me for having pills they want. I can’t say enough good about sublocade. It is impossible to abuse given that it has to be administered by a health care professional, there are absolutely no ups and downs, you feel the same normal way all the time, and it’s only a once a month commitment.",AddictedToItAll

39,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,10.0,,"January 19, 2021",50,"I struggled with a severe heroin/fentanyl addiction for 10 plus years. I had been to at least 14 rehabs not counting detoxes and incarcerations. I've overdosed so many times that I had lost count. I had hit my ""rock bottom"" and made the decision to stop only to later relapse and find out that my bottom could always be a dug a little deeper. I had truly lost the will to live. I had destroyed everything that I had ever loved or cared about. I had contemplated and attempted suicide via o.d.ing. I've went the suboxone and methadone routes to inevitably end up right back where I started. I was stuck in what seemed to be a ground hogs day in the deepest crevices of mental, physical, and emotional never ending nightmare. I came to truly understand through witnessing the outcomes of other addicts that my two options were death or prison. I've been on sublocade for I believe 11 months now.

40,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2020",55,"I have been on medication for opiate dependence since 2007. The majority of that time spent on Suboxone 8mg.But as much as 16mg daily and for a short time 4mg daily. About 6 weeks ago my doctor suggested Sublocade due to the fact that I was unable to make it to my WEEKLY appts for a Suboxone Rx and treatment with Sublocade meant I only needed to come into the office monthly. With some hesitation and reluctance I finally agreed,  as the alternative was discharge from my program. I understood my biggest fears to be not having the medication in my possession to feed the habit of taking something EVERYDAY. And also the fear that it wouldn't last 30 days, being sick with withdrawals and not having anything to stop that. Well, I was beyond pleasantly surprised by how my body took to this drug. I cannot say enough positive things about the medication.  I would recommend this medication to anybody who  has found trouble with the alternative,  Suboxone.",Jersey Grl

The injection stung but I immediately felt great, and no issues going from Suboxone (8mg’s a day) to Sublocade.

I think that Methadone hurt me far worse then helped, then the suboxone strips for 7 years worked fantastically until I'd stop them in order to use, and by then it wasn't heroin its Fentanyl I've overdosed four times  for the first time in 25 years, so on to sublocade I went, its only helpful if you have the money to pay for what insurance doesn't.   Your Doctor has to order it for you and its a nightmare.   However it doesn't hurt its great not doing repetitive things, unfortunately I started craving heroin or Fentanyl and started getting high again but today I have been 3 days clean and thanks to the strips I'm just not strong enough I suppose.",Alds

To my surprise it has now been 4 months since my last dose and I have had ZERO withdrawals, that’s right, none!!! I had tried to ween off of suboxone and even the 2mg shift made me ill but stopping sublocade cold turkey I had no withdrawals. It’s seriously a miracle. If you have been wanting to quit but you can’t bare the withdrawals, or if you’re feeling hopeless that you’re going to be on opiate blockers for the rest of your life I strongly encourage you to get 1 sublocade injection and see how you feel.

I am so grateful to god for it. Ironically I really want to get sober and prayed for help. The Doc in detox recommended and ordered it the day I left the hospital and finally after 3 weeks of staying on subs I made the Jump. I don't wake up sick and no more playing Dr all the time.

It really makes you feel normal and you don't experience any changing in levels, up or down. I now forget about having my next appointment because you don't even think about it.

I have had almost 24 injections so far and did not have any infections or issues. The reviews were people had necrosis has scared me a little but I luckily have not had a problem.I did the typical schedule to start with 300 mg and move to 100 mg. For me it felt like week 4 of the 100 mg shot was underpowered so I went back up to 300mg and that really did the trick.

73,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,10.0,,"November 13, 2019",43,If your considering getting the sublocade injection don’t overthink it - if your truly done using JUST GET IT.  It works way better than the strips or tabs and I feel like a normal person now( like I felt before I was an addict). I’m not going to lie you should mentally prepare yourself for the shot itself because it burns really bad for a good 10-15 mins TOPS. The needle itself doesn’t hurt at all it’s the gooey  substance they shoot under your skin that starts burning really bad. But I promise you it’s so worth every second of it. Just man or women up and get it and then lay back your seat in the car and chill for 15 minutes before you leave and it’ll be over. I’ve had two injections now so trust me - leaning back helps... even just stay laying on the table at the doctors for a few minutes if they’ll let you. The bump is big when you first get it but it goes down it’s not uncomfortable in my opinion. Just try it.,Steph

I actually feel normal like the subs were supposed to work. They say traces can stay in system for a year. I have heard of a few people ween off successfully. I am hesitant to get off.

I get my shot on Monday and we are taking another 10% off. I can also tell you one time I went 64 days on a 100mg shot with no withdrawal or any kind of symptoms so this shot Is super long acting. No joke 64 days cause I was switching jobs and insurances. When I got my new insurance and went for the next dose after 64 days I still felt fine. I have searched high and low and there is zero info on coming off Sublocade. I guess I will keep you posted.",Seanziggs11

I just wanted to get some support as I am freaking out knowing that I can never use again. Being an addict for over thirty years and getting the shot at 5 months sober, I am just wondering what the sublocade community is like as I have read all the reviews before I went in. I guess I will have more to say about it when I have more then three hours of it in my system.",hellkitty
81,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 2, 2019",77,"I was part of the phase III trial of what is now called Sublocade.  This shot literally saved my life.  I was doing $300 of heroin IV everyday for years.  I went to rehab, tried Suboxone strips, weaning, etc etc etc, nothing worked.  I took this shot at 300mg for 14 months, and not only did I have no issues quitting, but I had no withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing the shot.  I fully 100% recommend this medication to anyone suffering from opiate dependency.  Please, don't hesitate.  Try it if you're able.",Casper
82,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,,,"July 11, 2019",48,Sublocade has been amazing!! The injection is painful but worth it!! And if you have been stabbing yourself with needles for years you can handle this I promise! I went almost two months with out anything after some insurance issues and had zero withdrawal symptoms. You don't have to wake up and think about anything anymore. The freedom that comes with the injection is amazing. Take the chance and try it. I would bet every penny I have that you wont regret it!!,Anonymous
83,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,10.0,,"June 17, 2019",57,"I am now on my 4th shot it’s been so amazing!!! No withdrawals or cravings.  I can get up every day and live my life as normal as one can, no pain too.  The Sublocade shot has given me a peace of mind, no more worry about if my meds are going to be in stock or no more worrying about insurance if it’s going to be covered or if I need a prior authorization.  People.. take it from me the needle poke don’t hurt it’s the medicine going in that then it starts to burn a little.   Nothing I can’t handle though. I've been on subs since 2011 straight, being  on 20mg daily. This shot has given me comfort when I switched  the more shots u get the higher blood plasma that the medicine will be in your body.... the 300mg shot is equivalent to about 24mg sublingual films............. I hope this helps",Kevink
84,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,9.0,,"June 13, 2019",71,"Rated this 9 out of 10, as I’m still taking the 100mg shot (5th one). Unsure what stopping will feel like. I was on subs for 7yrs! I have a busy life & I can’t afford to leave & deal with being sick. Most of what I read about sublocade scared the poop outta me; luckily I have a fantastic doctor I trust & I chose to listen to him. Getting the shot sucks & definitely hurts worse than I thought. So what! It’s 30 seconds of stinging/burning sensation for legit freedom! This has been SUCH a blessing! Literally day 3 I forgot I was ever taking anything on daily basis. After required 300mg shots, I went right to the 100mg with 0 issues/transition. Actually, I forgot to schedule my next appointment before leaving & ended up going 7 weeks b4 thinking...hmm, seems like it’s been a while since my last appt. Do u know how insane that is after being on subs for SO long?! Ur crazy if u have opportunity to switch & u don’t take it. Honestly, u will think what was I waiting for within the first week!!",Want off everything!
85,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 25, 2019",100,"So I came here looking for information before I received my first shot. I was taking two 8mg suboxone pills a day for a couple of years prior when I received my shot.  Before I took the shot I was legitimately nervous because of all these reviews I read on here. The actual shot was painful and burned but it subsided in a couple mins.  You get the shot in your stomach and it becomes an aching pain instead of burning and the location will be sore for about 4 days.  Don't be scared of the shot it is a fleeting and temporary pain...worrying about having enough meds to last the month will not be a problem anymore.  I no longer have to worry about taking the right amount of meds. It's much easier for me this way. Now I don't feel like I have to take a pill to feel ok. I've had no w/d symptoms, no side effects beside the pain from the shot.   I'm writing this to ease your minds about the shot...its so much better than taking the meds.",Razoo
86,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 23, 2019",43,I’ve been a drug addict for 35 years. I suffered a severe back injury at the age of 21 and it was downhill from there- no motivation except the drive to get drugs. I started Sublocade four months ago for my opiate addiction and haven’t looked back. I didn’t like Suboxone because it gave me a buzz. That’s not the case with Sublocade. One shot a month- no more obsession. Today I’m free.,MrLee
87,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,9.0,,"May 1, 2019",31,"Since I’ve been on the sublocade, which is been two months now, I feel like I have lifted a huge weight off my back. I get out of bed right away and I just go about my day instead of worrying about taking the time to dissolve two strips under my tongue for like a half hour. I have noticed a change in my behavior as far as just being more positive about not being stuck on some medication, even though I still am on it  - it’s just a little more liberating",Sbb
88,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 30, 2019",39,"Been on Sub strips for few years. Got tired of the 2 week refill nonsense . I asked my doctor if I could be the office guinea pig for the sublocade 300 mg shot. Taken once a month by injection. We hashed out the insurance details and started on 4/28/19. The injection site burns and hurts going in leaving a slight bruise. Not looking forward to my next shot HOWEVER, this stuff is GREAT. Other than the pain and burn it works. The injection site will have a lump like spot after. This is normal. That’s the medicine sitting under the skin. Turns into a solid and slowly gets absorbed into the body throughout the month . When compared to the pain and suffering I caused during my addiction this slight side effect to the drug doesn’t compare. If you want a better life and to be right !!! You gotta get involved with this sublocade or any other type of opioid treatment like  Suboxone . Take it as prescribed and life gets better. Bottom line. Hope this helps",PG
89,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 13, 2019",25,"There is NO naloxone in this med for anyone wondering or saying there is. Sublocade has buprenorphine ONLY. I was on strips for 2 years before, technically, being forced to go to the shot due to other people in my area diverting their meds. I have never diverted my medication, but was told if I wanted to do maintenance, I would have to switch and I was happy to because I don't divert my meds and could care less how it is administered. I have nothing but good things to say about it. Don't have to worry about traveling with it or the box falling apart in your purse or bag, theft or any other problems that arise if you currently take the pills or strips. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to do maintenance if your insurance covers it.",CmC13

91,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 12, 2019",22,"Was prescribed the tablets (then, films) for 2 years before I finally got the Sublocade injection. I did not dose as normal on the morning of the injection.  The injection *burned* going in, lasting about 1-2 minutes. Right away I could tell that a decent amount of buprenorphine had entered my system. I told my doctor that I hadn't dosed my films that morning; he suggested that it might help to take 1 or 2 films, in addition to the injection. I took 2 films and, no doubt about it, I had a significant amount of bupe in my system. Slept really good that first night, and when I woke up I could tell that I'd woken up with a good amount of bupe already in my system. And this matches clinical trials data that 'Tmax', following first injection, is at about 24 hours -- i.e., an initial peak in plasma bupe levels occurs about 24 hours after the initial injection. So now am waiting to see what the coming days bring. My hope is that I'll be totally free from having to put things under my tongue.",ForeignWars Correspondent
92,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,5.0,,"January 31, 2019",20,"I am unsure about this shot. I have gotten it twice now and had to fight for the second injection. The first time I got it I was only two in 5,000 people where the shot didn’t properly dissolve into my body and I had extreme withdrawals after two days. They even did a urine and blood test and my bup scores were 500 on the strips and down to 70 by the time they believed I was in withdrawal and put me back on to strips. I just got my second one by a different doctor after the doctors spoke to pharma and any other doctors about their opinions on me getting a second dose because I want off suboxone, I’ve been stuck on it for 5 years and had two children during this time. I want to be free and I experience insane withdrawal when I wean off of strips. So it’s day two and I am getting some hot and cold sweats but feel a little more tired than last time and I am not feeling as sick as last time. I am so hopeful! I will update this in 10 days! :)",Mare

It was like we hit the lottery. It took a few days for us to adjust to it, but when we did it was amazing! It really helps with your dopamine levels and cravings. We took it for 13 months and then we got off it. We didn’t have any withdrawl symptoms or pain at all following our last shot. I highly recommend it to any opiate users. It was the only way we quit using after seven years.",Magic

If you're really willing to quit, the medication will work. However, stop relying on the medication alone. See a therapist, and go to meetings. They have them online. Sublocade has a program where you only have to pay $5 a shot most of the time if you're not on state medicaid. I do what I'm supposed to do to stay clean. If you truly want the same thing, you'll do what you gotta do. And if you try this medication, do the things I've suggested here, stop making excuses, and change your lifestyle, you will get clean and stay that way.

105,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence,8.0,,"May 26, 2018",33,"My husband has been on suboxone for three years. Three days ago he received his first sublocade injection. It does leave a knot at the injection site but isn't painful. The day of the shot, he experienced extreme euphoria (unusual for him with bup/nal) and said his head felt a lot of pressure but felt no withdrawal symptoms. Day two, the euphoric feeling was gone, but he said he felt like he'd been hit by a truck and had a massive headache. Still no withdrawal, though. Today is day 3, and he woke up with another truly bad headache that made him nauseous. Still though, no withdrawals. The goal is to eventually wean off the medication. He's being patient and trying to believe these side effects (reported as common) are just his body adapting to the new delivery system. The most important thing is to avoid debilitating withdrawal. For that purpose, it has been effective. I'll continue to post as he moves closer to the end of the first cycle and when he receives his second injection.",Wife
