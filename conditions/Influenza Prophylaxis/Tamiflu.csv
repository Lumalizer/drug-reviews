0,Tamiflu,Influenza Prophylaxis,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 1, 2019",4,"Prescribed Tamiflu after being exposed to someone who tested positive for the flu, and I was showing mild symptoms (congestion, drainage, fatigue). The only side effects I noticed at first was nausea and stomach cramps. I took the pill with plenty of food. The stomach upset wasn't so intense I couldn't handle it. I'm on the last of my pills (2 left) and today my anxiety is a bit increased. I have an anxiety disorder so I'm not sure if it's the pills or just me. As far as taking care of my symptoms: I do feel like it helped keep symptoms less severe than they would have been without it. I fared much better than my relative who tested positive. But I never got tested so I have to give it a 5 since I'm not sure if it was the flu or a common cold.",CatLady85
1,Tamiflu,Influenza Prophylaxis,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 27, 2019",6,On day two canâ€™t sleep as the abdominal pain is so severe. Had diarrhea today no vomiting. Severely fatigued today but going to truck through as I am severe asthmatic and death is worse than what I am going through now so sucking it up. But I would say this medicine is horrible.,Kk
2,Tamiflu,Influenza Prophylaxis,2,,"January 31, 2018",2,"I have 5 little ones sick with the flu. Doctor prescribed Tamiflu, The taste is horrid, I have to wrestle each one of them to get the medicine down. I now have 2 with such bad nausea and diarrhea. I am assuming side effects. One with nose bleeds. I can't say if it has helped, for a prescription I would hope for something easier for children to take. Also, They have still had the high fevers and flu symptoms.  4 of the children were taking Tamiflu before flu symptoms accrued.",Brooke mom of 9
3,Tamiflu,Influenza Prophylaxis,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 15, 2016",7,"My 6 year old daughter was feeling sick. We went to Nextcare. We told the doctor she had been feeling bad for 3 or 4 days. He prescribed Tamiflu even though it says not take it to unless you have been experiencing symptoms for less than 2 days. $200 later she is worse than I have ever seen her. Watch out ,big pharmaceutical doesn't care.",Flu hater
4,Tamiflu,Influenza Prophylaxis,1,,"March 1, 2016",9,My kids were exposed to the flu and were prescribed liquid Tamiflu as a preventive measure. I was able to reason with my 5 year old to get her to take it but my 2 year old was having none of it. I tasted it myself to see what the issue was. It really is disgusting. For $200 out of pocket I would expect a medicine designed for children to taste a little better.,Brian W.
5,Tamiflu,Influenza Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 1, 2015",11,I came down with the flu TYPE B a local clinic wrote me a prescription. The Dr told me it wouldn't make me feel better but rather shorten the duration. I figured might as well try it. I've stopped after 3 doses - awful diarrhea and nausea. I'd rather let nature take its course than go through what I have for the last 10 hours.,Anonymous
