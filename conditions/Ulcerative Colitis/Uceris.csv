0,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2021",0,Tried this twice for flares prior to Prednisone while on Lialda as my main med. Didn't work for me at all. If anything it made flares worse. Only Prednisone helped clear the flares.,Dude Lebowski
1,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 13, 2021",0,"Terrific drug. I use the rectal foam every other day. My life is now completely normal. The drug, however, is expensive, costing $600 and up for a month's supply on the open market. My insurance company considers it a specialty drug. The last time I paid ca. $100 for a two-month's supply. But the actual amount of the drug in the box of two cylinders may last as long as three months if the drug is taken no more than three or four times a week.",Paul
2,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,9.0,,"January 22, 2021",1,"It works really well for me when I'm not in too bad of a flare. I have been on it now for just over a year while I try all the different biologics, unable to get off of Uceris without flaring again. It takes a bit longer than prednisone to work so give it a couple weeks. It's been great for me while I try all of these biologic meds since they all take forever to see if they're going to work. I haven't had any side effects other than I started getting a ton of stretch marks for the first time in my life (I'm 37) and they kept coming even when I had stopped gaining weight. It's also been very difficult to lose much weight. I gained a ton while on prednisone a bunch over the past few years. I take the generic.",Sara
3,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,,,"June 15, 2020",6,"I have had UC for over 20 years.  Been on Remicade, Humira, zeljanz, Asocol, prednisone.  You name it I tried it.  I am now strictly on Lialda and have been in a flare for about a month. I was prescribed Uceris and the problem I have is, since I have severe urgency it is hard to keep the foam from wanting to come back out.  My UC is in the lower colon and I go to bathroom between 10 and 20 times per day.  It is very painful to try to hold in the foam.  Suggestions?",Roxanne

5,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 20, 2019",15,"Went through months of bloody stools and frequent trips to bathroom with no output.  Went to hospital for the 3rd colonoscopy in 5 years to find infection in rectum.  They put me on Uceris foam, the  first two weeks it didn't lead to much relief but around the end if the third week everything snapped into pace and the Uceris worked and everything seemed to go back to normal.  Will see if this is permanent or just a temporary fix",BP
6,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,1.0,,"November 2, 2018",8,"I felt like I was going into a UC flare so my doctor told me to take Uceris for two months. We wanted to avoided the harsh side effects of pred. (Just found out I have osteopenia at 23 because of my pred usage) Within a week of me taking it I started having extremely watery stool... I would go 10-15 times a day and dealt with this for the two months (the duration of the uceris course). My doctor finally tested me for C-Diff and I was positive! I can’t imagine I got the cdiff from anything BUT using this medicine because it happened a week after I started. I’ve never had C-Diff in the past. It was a NIGHTMARE! Because I got the infection, it put me back in a horrible flare- the combo sent me into the hospital for a week. I’m currently doing the Uceris rectal foam and that is working WONDERS for me!! My effected area tends to be in my lower colon so the foam put me into remission after about two weeks! Zero side effects.",E
7,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 11, 2018",12,"No. I will never take this again. It has caused nausea, stomach pain, fatigue, broken sleep and whatever else wasn’t already bad enough with my flare.",Lauren315
8,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,6.0,,"September 26, 2018",23,"I have been prescribed this for microscopic colitis. I have been hesitating, and this site has convinced me to try it. I am on Medicare and my supplemental insurance has quoted me $1500 for this medicine for two months. My co-pay is $365 and only pays for one month. This is insane. What should I do for the second month pay $1500? Our world is crazy. Fortunately my G.I. doctor has given me some samples so I will try it. Thank you all of you for your comments.",Kats
9,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2018",15,"I am now on this drug for the second time for Microscopic colitis . The last time was in 2014. The drug, in itself, works great for me BUT it is the drug company I have the issue with. They publicize that with their drug savings card plus your insurance, you only have to pay $25. THAT IS UNTRUE!! When you get to the fine print, you find that the company, in the goodness of their heart, will pay the first $800 ONCE per year for a drug costing $917.48 for 30 tablets. So, for the first script, it is a cost of $117.48 - hope don't need a second month cause then it would be $917.48. So please know this ahead of time!!!!",clm3
10,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 25, 2017",19,"Uceris has been the best medicine I have tried for my collagenous colitis. Everything else did not work or had too many side effects. To me this is a miracle medicine. They say to take one 9mg per day, but believe it or not that actually made me constipated.  For me nothing took away the D,  even when I took seven Imodium a day.  So I started taking Uceris on a as needed basis.   It worked out to take one or two a week.  So for me I rated a 10  with no side effects .",Geoege92065
11,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 9, 2017",7,"I have UC for 12 years, I was in remission for a few years and then all of a sudden I had a flare up, I have been one this medication for almost 2 months. When I first started on it, it helped for like a week or so. I had swelling in my face and joints and sore muscles and headaches. My doctor told me to stick with it so my body could adjust properly and it helped but didnt stop my issues. For the last week I have been going to the bathroom 10 times a day. Me and my doctor are now trying to figure out the next step.",12 years and counting....
12,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 26, 2017",23,"I am now on my second bottle of Uceris.  It took about 2 weeks before it became effective for my microscopic colitis; in other words, when my diarrhea stopped completely.  After becoming effective, I experienced 2 side effects; first, swelling of both ankles that lasted a few days, less than a week.  After that, I had no ankle problem at all, except for a feeling of pins and needles on both feet, which I don't find problematic.  Second, an increase in appetite, which I needed, as I had lost 11 lb. as a result of diarrhea.  The appetite increase lasted about 10 days.  Uceris has given me a chance at feeling well, and able to live my life.",Angostura

14,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,,,"May 16, 2016",15,"My physician prescribed budesonide originally for my Ulcerative Colitis, but I felt the out of pocket price for this RX was out of the ball park, so after contacting my physician again they gave me a RX for Uceris, and sent me information to assist in the cost, but after my insurance coverage and the $600, that the ""coupon""  that was sent to me, the total still came to over $200.00 for 30 days..  I have a copay of only $20.00, but since some entity seems to have the cost of this RX I have not been able to afford it and see what help it is--",kkrc in ND

Most work for two or three months, then I experience a flair.   Uceris has placed me in remission for 6 months!  Expensive?  Yes, outrageous.

17,Uceris,Ulcerative Colitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 27, 2014",24,"Been using Balsalazide 3x3 for 9 years or so with occasional flareups I could resolve with slight overdosing.  Could not resolve present flare up.  After a month of 4 bowel motions a day, blood, diarrhea, doc started me on Uceris. Next day change to 1 bowel motion, no blood, slight diarrhea.  Now 1 wk later, pretty normal 1 bowel motion per day, with occasional nausea in abdomen. I think pretty good for a week.  But the price is outrageous, and even my copay is $75 mo.  Doc insists on giving it to me for 3 mos.",Anonymous
