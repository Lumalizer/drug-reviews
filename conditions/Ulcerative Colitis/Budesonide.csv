0,Budesonide,Ulcerative Colitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 4, 2021",0,"I suffered frequent diarrhea, gas and stomach pains for four months and lost 25 pounds with Collagenous colitis. Finally started on Budesonide at 9 MG a day for first month then 6 MG for month two and 3mg for month three. This dosage tapering off approach is important when taking steroids. It took 2 weeks before it started to work but then my symptoms began to abate and became fully resolved by the end of month three with zero side effects.  After I stopped the medication the symptoms started to return after two weeks and I thought I was doomed but I took some Imodium and that did the trick. I have been symptom free for 8 months now. Thankfully I have a drug plan and live in Canada so I only had to pay a very small amount for these very expensive pills.",Lisa S.
1,Budesonide,Ulcerative Colitis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 19, 2021",0,"I am on this for microscopic collagenous colitis. What about UTI symptoms?  Anyone?  Been on just over 3 weeks, symptoms improved, and 5 more weeks to go (3 tablets 3 mg each = 9 mg per day taking all at once in AM) and then started having UTI symptoms.  Sometimes incontinence (not making it to the BR in time) and low back on right side cramping/throbbing).  Urine sample resulted in NO UTI but general PA doc telehealth over weekend prescribed antibiotic and that stuff that turns urine orange.  IT WORKED pretty quickly and now they messaged me through the Atrium portal that I do not have UTI, apparently they did a culture but who knows, and to stop taking the antibiotic!  I don't want to stop taking it... its only a 5 day thing and I have 3 more days.  I am confused if BUDESONIDE can mimick a UTI.  This stuff is so crazy!  anyone have the same issue?  how does it resolve?  thank you",Joy

3,Budesonide,Ulcerative Colitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 23, 2021",0,"This did nothing for me, except result in more diarrhea and lack of sleep. I found the side effects far worse than prednisone. I took it for five days at 9 mg/day orally. I felt edgy and the insomnia was horrible. I also had stomach cramps and more trips to the bathroom. I had to stop it.",Lesliegb6720
4,Budesonide,Ulcerative Colitis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 13, 2021",0,"Uceris (budesonide):Terrific drug. I use the rectal foam every other day. My life is now completely normal. The drug, however, is expensive, costing $600 and up for a month's supply on the open market. My insurance company considers it a specialty drug. The last time I paid ca. $100 for a two-month's supply. But the actual amount of the drug in the box of two cylinders may last as long as three months if the drug is taken no more than three or four times a week.",Paul
5,Budesonide,Ulcerative Colitis,9.0,,"January 22, 2021",1,"Uceris (budesonide):It works really well for me when I'm not in too bad of a flare. I have been on it now for just over a year while I try all the different biologics, unable to get off of Uceris without flaring again. It takes a bit longer than prednisone to work so give it a couple weeks. It's been great for me while I try all of these biologic meds since they all take forever to see if they're going to work. I haven't had any side effects other than I started getting a ton of stretch marks for the first time in my life (I'm 37) and they kept coming even when I had stopped gaining weight. It's also been very difficult to lose much weight. I gained a ton while on prednisone a bunch over the past few years. I take the generic.",Sara

I am now strictly on Lialda and have been in a flare for about a month. I was prescribed Uceris and the problem I have is, since I have severe urgency it is hard to keep the foam from wanting to come back out.  My UC is in the lower colon and I go to bathroom between 10 and 20 times per day.  It is very painful to try to hold in the foam.  Suggestions?",Roxanne

10,Budesonide,Ulcerative Colitis,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 2, 2019",4,I have been taking Uceris for 3 weeks for my Ulcerative Proctitis. It has not given much relief yet but I see some reviews here that say it took weeks to work for some. I notice no side effects at all so far. I was first given Prednisone and that was working well but my Doctor was worried about  problems from long term usage. I was shocked at the price. At pharmacy for a 30 day supply is $1815.00. Thankfully with my health insurance my co-pay is $10.00,NWB
11,Budesonide,Ulcerative Colitis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 20, 2019",15,"Uceris (budesonide):Went through months of bloody stools and frequent trips to bathroom with no output.  Went to hospital for the 3rd colonoscopy in 5 years to find infection in rectum.  They put me on Uceris foam, the  first two weeks it didn't lead to much relief but around the end if the third week everything snapped into pace and the Uceris worked and everything seemed to go back to normal.  Will see if this is permanent or just a temporary fix",BP
12,Budesonide,Ulcerative Colitis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 16, 2019",6,"I have Collengenous/microscopic colitis and have  used this medication on and off for 6 years.  I really haven’t had any side effects that I realized. I completed a 3 month dosage on Dec 29, 2018.  I was diarrhea free for about 2.5 weeks then it slowly started again so I am back on it.  I am  on Medicare. I found out using  Drug RX coupon works.  However you must have your Doctor write the prescription for 90 pills x 3 per day for only 30 days .  If it goes over 30 days (31 or 90) days it will be over $300. But it is written for 30 day My is only $100.  The key is the number of Day not the amount of pills in the prescription .  Crazy isn’t. Someone is making lots of money off of this. Check with your Medicare insurance about the # of pills vs.  # of days. There should not be tiers for drugs on Medicare.   Medicare need to be revised for drug prices.",Acorn
13,Budesonide,Ulcerative Colitis,1.0,,"November 2, 2018",8,"Uceris (budesonide):I felt like I was going into a UC flare so my doctor told me to take Uceris for two months. We wanted to avoided the harsh side effects of pred. (Just found out I have osteopenia at 23 because of my pred usage) Within a week of me taking it I started having extremely watery stool... I would go 10-15 times a day and dealt with this for the two months (the duration of the uceris course). My doctor finally tested me for C-Diff and I was positive! I can’t imagine I got the cdiff from anything BUT using this medicine because it happened a week after I started. I’ve never had C-Diff in the past. It was a NIGHTMARE! Because I got the infection, it put me back in a horrible flare- the combo sent me into the hospital for a week. I’m currently doing the Uceris rectal foam and that is working WONDERS for me!! My effected area tends to be in my lower colon so the foam put me into remission after about two weeks! Zero side effects.",E

I have been hesitating, and this site has convinced me to try it. I am on Medicare and my supplemental insurance has quoted me $1500 for this medicine for two months. My co-pay is $365 and only pays for one month. This is insane. What should I do for the second month pay $1500? Our world is crazy.

16,Budesonide,Ulcerative Colitis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2018",15,"Uceris (budesonide):I am now on this drug for the second time for Microscopic colitis . The last time was in 2014. The drug, in itself, works great for me BUT it is the drug company I have the issue with. They publicize that with their drug savings card plus your insurance, you only have to pay $25. THAT IS UNTRUE!! When you get to the fine print, you find that the company, in the goodness of their heart, will pay the first $800 ONCE per year for a drug costing $917.48 for 30 tablets. So, for the first script, it is a cost of $117.48 - hope don't need a second month cause then it would be $917.48. So please know this ahead of time!!!!",clm3

Everything else did not work or had too many side effects. To me this is a miracle medicine. They say to take one 9mg per day, but believe it or not that actually made me constipated.  For me nothing took away the D,  even when I took seven Imodium a day.  So I started taking Uceris on a as needed basis.   It worked out to take one or two a week.  So for me I rated a 10  with no side effects .",Geoege92065

Today at Walmart, they charged me $767.76!!!!!  I have been taking Prednisone for the last six months, but do not feel comfortable taking this steroid for long-term since my condition is from celiac, causing my colitis.  The pharmacist informed me that this, along with many other pharmaceuticals have doubled their pricing.  This is absolutely unaffordable for people with my problems.  Isn't there any type of coupons or discounts  that I can get?  Any assistance would be appreciated.  Thank you.",Jenmneill

22,Budesonide,Ulcerative Colitis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 9, 2017",1,"GI doctors diagnosed me with  IBS-D .  None of the medications prescribed produced a solution.  I was hit by repeated attacks of incontinence  (diarrhea).   My present GI doctor diagnosed me with microscopic colitis, for which he prescribed budesonide.  It worked I have been using it successfully for about a year and a half.   It is an off-label drug.  not yet OK'd by the FDA for colitis. It has been ok'd for use for asthma for about 10 years but has not been ok'd for microscopic colitis.  Therefore, I pay just under $400.00 a month for a medication that is generic placed on ""Tier 4"" in Medicare D.  In 2016 I was billed just under $200.00 for the same quantity .No other drugs are effective. This one is too expensive",nalla1406

It took about 2 weeks before it became effective for my microscopic colitis; in other words, when my diarrhea stopped completely.  After becoming effective, I experienced 2 side effects; first, swelling of both ankles that lasted a few days, less than a week.  After that, I had no ankle problem at all, except for a feeling of pins and needles on both feet, which I don't find problematic.  Second, an increase in appetite, which I needed, as I had lost 11 lb. as a result of diarrhea.  The appetite increase lasted about 10 days.

I went off but the symptoms returned after about two weeks and escalated . He put me back on with 2 per day for a month. Then I have taken one daily for maintenance.Recently my pharmacy stopped selling the red and grey capsules and changed to the teva peach and orange and my colitis came back with a vengeance. Im back on 9mg day again. I have some of each generic. The Teva product is NOT the same strength or quality as the other red and grey. I have since tried each for a period and sympt.

Well, I was on it for three months and I finally felt like myself again.  Then my doctor informed me thatI should stop which I did.  After a couple of weeks I had the same symptomsagain.  Because it is a steroid it should not be used for any length of time I was told.  So like most everyone else I had tried Apriso, Lialda with no relief at all.
