0,Humira,Ulcerative Colitis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 17, 2022",0,"I was hospitalized & diagnosed with severe UC in 2016. I started on Humira 40mg biweekly.  Absolutely magical for me! I switched to the citrate free version when it became available and this made it even better (no more injection pain). I had normal bowel movements, felt great (just minor joint pain). Had a few flares over the next 5 years. Nothing a course of oral prednisone couldn't fix. Then last spring I started noticing TONS of mucus in BM (some bm were pure mucus and no stool). C reactive protein normal but fecal calories protectin off the charts (1700). Doctor checked for antibodies to Humira,  and sadly, my body is now making antibodies to the Humira.  I am devastated.  I wish I could go back in time to when it was a miracle drug for me. I literally had no side effects and there was nothing I couldn't do or eat. Now we are trying dosing with the Humira once weekly and have added methotrexate 15mg weekly (which makes me feel like rubbish, but that is a whole other review, right?)",DakotaMick

My TNF is still high and I am in the midst of a horrible; painful bout with UC. And of course my gastroenterologist is on vacation this week and no one on call for her. I have to say that Humira has not helped me at all and this bout  is very painful. I cannot eat and limited drinks. Water hits hard. I have been sipping on coke with fresh lemon in it. Does anyone else have this issue when their UC is full blown? Not able to eat; fatigue; acute abdominal pain and passing a lot of mucous. I am at my wits end. Any help???",Karmarie
5,Humira,Ulcerative Colitis,10.0,,"May 5, 2021",10,"I have been diagnosed with UC since I was 16, I'm now 37, so I have been on a few different medications to keep me in remission in those 21 years. I started with Remicade for a few years, but would still have flares, so then I was on a few pills while still taking Remicade. Started with Sulfasalzine (caused bad cramping in my joints) Mercaptopurine (6mp) which caused pancreatitis, which was the worst pain ever, then off and on steroids of course. I have been on 40 mg of Humira every other week for over 11 years at this point. The only few times I have been off of Humira is while I was pregnant twice during those 11 years, and once when I didn't have the insurance coverage because I changed jobs. (I had the worst flare of my life during that time without the insurance for 3 months, couldn't keep any food down, had internal bleeding and had to be rushed to the hospital after a colonoscopy) that was in 2016.

I had a bad flare up of UC and began Humira and saw results within a month. I've had a couple minor flare ups after taking humira, but it was fixed by adding a suppository for a short time. For the most part I had achieved good remission on Humira and pretty much forgot I had any issues to begin with. I never had to change my diet and continued moderate exercise. Switching insurances and doctors can become a pain to keep on schedule. I had to quit taking humira for 6 months after 6.5 years on it because I moved states and couldn't get into a new doctor soon enough and my insurance had changed. I finally started taking it again a week ago, so I'm not sure how effective it will be this time around. Cross my fingers it still works because I started having UC symptoms again.",Ally

I decided to write a review because I was extremely nervous about trying this medication due to all of the negative reviews on here. My U.C. got really out of control without me even realizing it throughout college, and eventually I decided to take charge of my health. My GI and I discussed all options and decided Humira was a good fit. I have now been on it for a year and fully in remission!! No blood and very little mucus for the last 7 months. I was discouraged because I saw no improvement for about 3 months but I began to feel so much better soon after. I have not been sick from the immunosuppression at all, I was also worried about that.

Currently I’ve been on humira for 4 months and started having bad site reactions. My doc told me to stop using it. My last dose was 2.5 weeks ago.  I don’t believe it helped me at all.

But, I had flare up and started back taking first Lialda, for about a week, then switched to Aspirso for another week and discovered these two drugs should be used only for UC maintenance.  So, I called my doctor's office and the Nurse put me back on the  steriods.  Which isn't working for me at all.  The Nurse said it takes a while before you start to see significant results.

23,Humira,Ulcerative Colitis,2.0,,"June 30, 2019",18,"I've been on different forms of mesalamine for years, in addition to prednisone. I've been fighting to get off the steroids for the past two years, but it's been a losing battle. My doctor recommended Humira. After the initial dose, I felt great. I took my second dose little over a week ago. My BMs haven't been great this week, and I saw some blood, but I'm once again seeming off the 'roids, so I blamed that. A few days after my last dose, I started feeling extremely lethargic and depressed. I've had a low-grade fever for days. On top of that, headaches that easily become migraines. If it was just that, I might have just chalked it up to coming off the prednisone, but the worst side-effect is that my memory has been alarmingly bad. Now that I'm doing more research on the drug, I'm regretting trusting my doctor and not getting the facts myself. I'm not planning on taking the next dose.",Ang

At the same time I developed 3 types of psoriasis which a dermatologist has confirmed in writing is a paradoxical medical condition caused by Humira. As a result I have lost 50 percent of my hair as the scalp psoriasis is so bad. It is also difficult to walk due to severe pustula psoriasis on the soles of my feet.

People need to realize that not all drugs work for everyone. I am lucky Humira has worked for me. The only side effects I have are constant runny nose, mild stomach aches and minor joint pain, which can actually be from the U.C and not necessarily the Humira. For those that find the injections painful, I suggest you let the pen warm up for 20 minutes before you do your injection. I don't like taking any meds, but when you have no options, being on Humira is a much better than  having severe U.C. symptoms all day and night.",Vod

In early 2014 my symptoms returned and I felt horrible for months and that is when my Doctor prescribed Humira 40mg. every other week. I started in July of 2014 and have had NO UC symptoms at all.

31,Humira,Ulcerative Colitis,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 18, 2018",18,"Been on it since October 27th, 2017. Have seen little improvement. Only recently (August 28th, 2018) have I noticed there is no more blood in my stool and the frequent bowel movements have decreased dramatically. Can no longer consume dairy. Cannot drink any sodas. Dark sodas hurt so much it is unbearable. Have needed one blood transfusion before humira and another one while on it. Also needed an iron infusion. Have been on 4 mesalamine daily along with the humira. Only worked for a week after Aug. 28th and then symptoms returned but have been lesser. So basically I must be unlucky because what should have taken about 3 months took 10 months to see little results. I am 19 (20 in a month) and have been suffering with ulcerative colitis since 16. Not sure how all of you do it but I am feeling so overwhelmed by how much my life has had to change from this disease. It has given me such unbearable anxiety that affects my daily life.

Just had the start up shots several days ago and the running to the bathroom has slowed down to almost normal. I know it's early on this deal and there's no silver bullet for a cure I'm just looking to be somewhat better.,Skipper1966

50,Humira,Ulcerative Colitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 16, 2013",102,"Was on Remicade for over a year, which cleared the ulcerative colitis within a few weeks. However within two weeks after the Remicade I started having arthritis systems that got so severe I was taking Vicodin every 4 hours and still unable to sleep, or just do usual chores around the house. My hands were so swollen, I couldn't use them. Finally Dr. decided to try Humira every 2 weeks. I have gone back to doing most of my chores, walking the dogs and my hands are no longer swollen. I am starting to feel like a normal person again. Have only had three injections, which sting like the dictions for a few minutes but it is worth it not to be in pain all the time. I hope this continues.",Hickiemon
