I went into complete remission of my UC and HORRIFIC joint pain. I have currently been in remission and prednisone free for 8 months",works great
1,Ustekinumab,Ulcerative Colitis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 3, 2021",11,"Stelara (ustekinumab):All I can say is this drug has been a life saver. If you are reading this, you’ve probably already tried other medications by now. For me, initially I tried Remacaid. After a few infusions, no success. Then I tried Entyvio. Same result. Getting very discouraged, I now tried Xeljanz. No improvement at all. This was all over a year and a half. I was starting to come to the realization that surgery was my only option. Then my Gastroenterolgist suggested Stelara which although known to be treated for rheumatoid arthritis, recent studies have shown success with ulcerative colitis. After my first treatment, I started seeing my symptoms improving. After my second treatment I was seeing drastic changes to point where my bowel movements were down to 2-3x per day, down from 10-15. Today, I can proudly say I am in remission and am leading a normal life, back to a regular diet and normal bowel movements. I can honestly say I owe my life to this drug and am thankful every day for it.",Adam

5,Ustekinumab,Ulcerative Colitis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 22, 2021",1,It hasn't helped my UC at all yet. I'm at week 7 and have had the IV and the first shot. My doctor had me do the first shot at 4 weeks instead of the typical 8. I tried to taper off my Uceris the other week and my symptoms came back almost immediately so it's clearly not working.,Sara
6,Ustekinumab,Ulcerative Colitis,6,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 13, 2021",2,"I have been suffering with UC since 2007.  It took a good while before anyone could diagnose me. It’s been a long, scary and tiresome road, tried nearly all oral meds, nothing worked. Been on/off steroids prednisolone which have had major joint side affects now. Started biological Humira but wasn’t responsive. Finally onto Stelara. After the first injection within a few weeks I felt a positive difference. Now onto my 5th injection, just a few days ago, however not feeling too good. Loose stool, Diarrhea, tiredness and fatigue slowly creeping back. Trying to stay positive as everyone responds differently. Good luck everyone stay safe.",Mary
