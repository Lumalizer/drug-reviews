I was having severe bleeding with stools, frequent abdominal cramping and gas after meals, frequent diarrhea and BMs with constant urgency. I took it for 3 years and in combination with adjusting diet it cleared the UC symptoms and got me back to normal. I didn't have any severe side effects, it might've made me feel lethargic and overweight at times which is why I wanted to get off it as soon as I felt better. I had remission for 5 years after I stopped taking it. PT 2: Microscopic colitis came back in the lower colon and I’ve had no luck with Lialda (generic and brand versions) or Apriso. Had to go on Prednisone twice for flares and have had constant gas, bloating, constipation and urgency issues for 3 years now.

I then tried the Pentasa tablets, taking 2 a day for 8 weeks now and what a difference. The bloating and pain in the stomach has gone down loads, bowel movements more regular and much less bleeding. I still get the odd niggly feelings and a small amount of blood so the doctor has recommend to up the does to 4 a day.  So far though these tablets have massively improved my ulcerative colitis.

After being sick for many months and in and out of the emergency room I was ready for something that would help me get my life back. I was having diarrhea with blood multiple times a day along with abdominal pain and cramps and down to 106 pounds. Lialda started working almost instantly for me. Within a week I was no longer having any loose stools, blood, and my pain level was down 80%. I had some side effects such as headaches, chills, fatigue, and dizziness; a small price to pay for how much Lialda helped me and saved my life. I was able to slowly decrease my dose to 2 tablets a day, then 1, and now none. I gained weight and started to feel more like myself again. For me personally it was a great experience that was worth any side effects that eventually went away after my body was used to the medication.

Probably as my inflammation extends to 20cm.After four days I started to feel better, I had more energy and more regular & solid stools. At first it was hard to keep the enema in, which is still true if I use a double dose as  prescribed.

I do not ""go"" as often and there is no more blood, but I am tired, have headaches, bloating, flatulence, and cramps---to the extent that I now get very little sleep.

I’m so thankful my employer was very understanding and supportive! I can not take steroids so my options were very limited. My doctor put me on this medication Apriso and it has been life changing for me. The medication is very expensive, but luckily my insurance covers it! When I initially called the pharmacy they told me my cost was over $800 for a 1 month supply, because my insurance denied it. I fixed that issue right away. Out of pocket from a pharmacy is about $30 for a 1 month supply. But I found a home delivery service that had a 3 month supply for only $24!!!

After 3 to 4 weeks the bathroom frequency went from 6 to 8 visits per day to just in the morning.  Since then I have gained 5 pounds so am thrilled about that as well. At first the only side effect was sinus related but that went away after a couple of weeks. The only thing I have since noticed is my hair more easily breaks when washing my hair but thinning hair for now sure beats 6 to 8 bathroom visits.
