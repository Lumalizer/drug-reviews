It sure makes hold it in much, much easier. I still sleep with a towel under me, but I don't leak if I do the enema first. I would say that if you have a hard time keeping it in (as I did) try the enema bag trick....You can get one at any drugstore. It sounds not fun, but its not that bad and it works!",Anonymous
