It started about a year or so ago in my left thumb joint. Now the pain is in every joint except one shoulder all within the last 8 months.I have no Idea what is going on but the pain from the joints is becoming greater by the day. The docs say age. I'm 62 and no history of RA in the family but who knows.,FHP3
1,Simponi,Ulcerative Colitis,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 23, 2020",2,Simponi has been a God send! Prior to starting Simponi I was unable to leave my home for any length of time. I had suffered for 2 years with UC and failed other treatments. My last C- scope in November 2020 was  the best of the last 4. ❤ If I had one suggestion it would be to package an alcohol swabs with each injection ( like Humira does).,Kay

3,Simponi,Ulcerative Colitis,1,,"September 24, 2020",1,"Been on Simponi for 3 months 5 tubes. I think I’ m worse than before. Bloating and going to toilet more often! I’ll give it another 3 months, but I can tell its not working. I know someone who also had no success with simponi, but might with Humira.",Jim
4,Simponi,Ulcerative Colitis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 27, 2020",3,"I've  got UC started therapy with Simponi almost two years ago because I was a steroid-dependent, even if I generally felt well. The last colonoscopy, done 6 months ago, showed that I was in complete remission and luckily I still feel great. I haven't noticed any collateral effect, maybe I've just gained some weight, but probably I was underweight before (I am 1,63m tall, and my actual weight is 51,5kg).",Volpe

6,Simponi,Ulcerative Colitis,1,,"March 18, 2017",18,"Simponi did not work for me.  Tried it three months, and it made all the bleeding, cramping and diarrhea worse.  I really wanted it to work for me...but it didn't. And Jannssen was NO help...called it ""side effects,"" when it was ""exacerbation of symptoms.""  Best wishes if you take it...I hope you find success with it.  :)",MelissaInFlorida

8,Simponi,Ulcerative Colitis,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 22, 2015",38,"Had a major flare up back in April that almost lead to emergency Colonectomy. Hospitalized for 19 days straight, was in 2 different hospitals lost about half my bodies blood and 50 lbs over 6 months time. 1st doctor put me on many of the wrong medications as the disease was too severe. Starting out on Lialda, Uceris then up to Remicade which started to work for about a week and then Prednisone which was horrible. When I was in the 2nd hospital I had another Doctor prescribe Simponi and it took a while but is working for sure. I went from 20 times a day of red to 1 - 3 times a day (clear water).",Backfromthe Brink
