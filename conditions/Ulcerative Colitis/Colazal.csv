3,Colazal,Ulcerative Colitis,7,,"November 24, 2010",11,This medicine really helped me get in remission about 6 years ago. I'm still taking it as a maintenance drug- but I have been flaring up for the past 2 years while taking it. Prednisone has been my savior as far as the flaring up. Next step...Remicade. We will see how it goes!,Anonymous
