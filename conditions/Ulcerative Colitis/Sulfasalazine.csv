2,Sulfasalazine,Ulcerative Colitis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 28, 2019",25,I’ve been using salazopyrin (sulfasalazine) for over 30 years for my ulcerative colitis.

5,Sulfasalazine,Ulcerative Colitis,1.0,,"February 15, 2018",7,"I had never heard something postive about this medication for colitis but I had to find out myself. From day 2 I started using sulfasalazine  I got super watery bowel movement. It worsened over time including blood. My doctor told that it had to take around a month to be fully working so I kept taking them. I had to go 25-30 times and even at night. The bloating started and there was so much gas in my stomach I was in real pain. On the 4th week I got a high fever. I stopped  the medication, but the fever lasted a week and I had a mild stomach bleeding. When I started it again I got a fever within 6 hours. Also my hair was falling out in chunks and my beard thinned out heavily. It worsened my life in the past 2 months. I was taking 2000mg",Millop

8,Sulfasalazine,Ulcerative Colitis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 3, 2017",14,"This medicine has completely turned my life around! Just when I was losing hope I started this medication 1000mg 4 times a day. I went from having severe gas pain, blood, mucas, a lot of BM, and uncomfortable distended stomach after I ate to EVERY symptom GONE after the first month of taking this medication! The only side effect I've experienced is the first few days of starting the medicine I had really bad stomach upset but after day 4 my body started to adjust and I had my first normal BM in almost a year! I also get headaches randomly but ibuprofen always knocks it out. Totally worth giving it a shot!",Anonymous
9,Sulfasalazine,Ulcerative Colitis,3.0,,"April 30, 2017",0,It wasn't helpful at all very useful.,Rita Moore
10,Sulfasalazine,Ulcerative Colitis,6.0,,"February 1, 2017",23,"I have taken sulfasalazine for 40 yrs. It worked OK on my u.c. until  I had a flair up. I would have to take 8 pills a day for months. My urine was always orange and Medicaid only paid for a limited number of pills per month. After much research this year,  I tried a probiotic for my gut. I found that one probiotic (45 billion active cultures) a day did a better job of keeping the u.c. at bay. I can eat vegetables I couldn't before.  I have less gas and more normal bowel movements. I quit taking the sulfasalazine because it interfered with the probiotic. I haven't had a problem these last 6 months even with excessive stress.",K.D.L.

14,Sulfasalazine,Ulcerative Colitis,8.0,,"April 7, 2014",23,"Sulfazine (sulfasalazine):I have been taking this medication for a while now, along with Azathioprine and Prednisone. Just today I stopped the Prednisone, after decreasing by a half each week. I experienced some remission of the Prednisone after I was at 2 and 1/2 pills, and bumped it back up to 5. I haven't experienced any bad side effects of the Sulfazine, and my only complaint is that it is really chalky. I am 13, and was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis almost a year ago.",sarahyue
