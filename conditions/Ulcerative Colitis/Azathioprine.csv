I still take it along with a diarrhea med. The imuran has been a life saver for me. Fatigue is normal, have not had to stop any activity.

3,Azathioprine,Ulcerative Colitis,6,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 31, 2017",6,"Have had UC since 1991 and been on Prednisolone and Asacol which became ineffective. Severe attack October 2016 - spent 10 days in hospital. IV steroids and then sent home on reducing steroids  - symptoms began to return. Azathioprine prescribed. Certainly helped reduce and eventually stop UC bleeding. Trips to the toilet reduced to around 3 or 4 occasions . Initially caused liver function problems which improved. However the drug has shattered my immune system - have taken any cold, cough or flu that crops up. Makes me fatigued after around 40 minutes exertion. Cannot now play golf, take hill walks or do heavy garden work etc. I guess it is good for some patients and not so good for others. Seeing consultant soon and will discuss options.",ColinAG54CSG

5,Azathioprine,Ulcerative Colitis,1,,"March 31, 2017",8,"Azathioprine was prescribed for my daughter as maintenance treatment for her UC. I can't tell anything about if it was working for her symptoms, because her flare symptoms were controlled by other temporary meds such as Ucerus, Cortifoam before she started taking it.. After 2 weeks she's started having hair loss, very rapid, developed pancytopenia, stopped taking it. This is the long story. I don't want to scare anyone, it's great that this drug helps some people.",B and Amy

7,Azathioprine,Ulcerative Colitis,7,,"November 9, 2016",26,Imuran (azathioprine):Have been on Imuran for 6 years and it has helped some off and on. In the beginning I went to the bathroom about 10 to 12 times in a day thus losing a lot weight which I didn't expect.  Now I go about 3 to 4 times a day and I do have a flare up every  now and then. Was finally weaned off of prednisone. Have gained some weight back. Overall the medication has helped though my immune system has been weakened.,No mercy jones
8,Azathioprine,Ulcerative Colitis,1,,"October 2, 2016",5,"I was given Azathioprine for about 3 weeks for my Ulcerative colitis.

11,Azathioprine,Ulcerative Colitis,10,,"January 24, 2016",25,"Been taking it for 7 months prior to this had really bad flares nothing worked. Steroids wouldn't control. Had UC for 19 years and had spread further up my colon. Was offered azathioprine. So thought why not. Best thing I have ever done, I have my life back.  My regular bloods are all normal. Not taking anything else for UC. Toilet once a day. Have joint pain but that a small price to pay. Don't have to worry about being near a toilet.",julie19720
12,Azathioprine,Ulcerative Colitis,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 13, 2016",52,I was extremely sick for over 2 years and refused to take this medication due to how scared I was of the side effects. I decided it was worth the risk and started taking it. I was tired a lot the first month but after one month I felt so good! I have been on it now for about 6 months and I am doing wonderful. I think we hear a lot of the bad things online because the people who these drugs work for are out enjoying life. I hope I give some of you peace of mind.,Tttttttt 100
13,Azathioprine,Ulcerative Colitis,9,,"December 24, 2015",40,Imuran (azathioprine):It is a miracle drug! After about 2 months my stools were becoming well formed but not back to the usual stool!

14,Azathioprine,Ulcerative Colitis,10,,"December 20, 2015",12,My colitis had been in remission for about 10 years without any drugs. 2 years ago it flared and we could not control it with Colazal as we had done last time. I was using prednisone with other meds that did not work. I was bleeding constantly and losing weight. Finally he prescribed azathioprine. It took several months to build up in my system but I am in full remission. I also take azacol HD with it.  My daily pill intake is 9. All my blood tests have been normal and we are now slowly reducing usage. As far as side effects go its difficult to identify them vs aging (57). I do have strange joint pain at times but I had multiple sport injuries when I was younger.  Cancer runs in my family so I want to get off this asap. I would use it again,Ed2015
15,Azathioprine,Ulcerative Colitis,8,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 23, 2014",39,"Imuran (azathioprine):Azathioprine worked well to reduce my ulcerative colitis symptoms and had zero noticeable side effects. The required frequent blood tests were a hassle and it did lower my white count significantly. In the end, the medicine was not sufficient to manage my condition and we added an anti-TNF to it. Once that was ramped up I discontinued azathioprine since it added nothing to the anti-TNF.",Tomh219

I started getting colds about every three weeks. Which made me feel run down and tired more so than just having colitis alone, but it did at least calm my symptoms for a while.",Anonymous

18,Azathioprine,Ulcerative Colitis,7,,"August 3, 2011",13,"This medicine seemed to work at first, the negatives ultimately were worse than the positives. It did put me down to about 4 bowel motions a day but it was at the cost of horrendous acne, terrible headaches, joint pain and fatigue. Doctor still has me on it for another autoimmune disease but keeps me at a minimum.",borderlineblue
19,Azathioprine,Ulcerative Colitis,9,,"May 27, 2011",64,"Imuran (azathioprine):Wonderful medicine. I was extremely sick, went 20 times to the bathroom in 8 to 9 hours, was really sick, finally gave in to start this medicine with the rest I had been taking. Within 5 hours everything slowed down. I felt like a new person. But sad to say it was short lived. I started reacting 2 to three days in and the reactions got worse. Had to stop taking it.",Southern Girl
