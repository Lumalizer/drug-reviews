1,Inflectra,Ulcerative Colitis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 2, 2020",22,"Was on REMICADE everything was great and I was back to feeling normal and in remission for long time. My insurance company did a mandatory med change so they could save a little bit of money. Now I'm in major pain again ,going threw flare up and near having to go to ER to get help. One dose of infletra was all it took to mess me up again. My insurance wont even let me back on REMICADE. I truly hope no one else has to be forced on infletra",Chino
