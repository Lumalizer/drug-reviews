0,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 18, 2021",1,"I have received my first three infusions and my hair is falling out so badly. I have lost at least half my hair. I use to have think beautiful curls. I was so sick before the Entyvio. It’s working but after the third infusion I experienced joint pain that made it difficult to walk, fatigue, aches that felt like the flu was setting in. Symptoms continued for two solid weeks. I just wish my hair would stop falling out. I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it. I’m 47 and devastated that I am on my way to being bald.",Anonymous
1,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 13, 2021",0,"I had really thick hair, I started Entyvio, and it made my hair shed so much that I lost probably 30% of my hair. I wasn't too concerned about it at first because I used to have to get my hair thinned because I had so much hair. I stopped Entyvio 3 months ago and my hair is still thinner than it used to be and I am still shedding probably more than the average person but not nearly as bad as when I was on it. I could put my hands through my hair and see so much falling out. Entyvio stays in your system for at least a month after your last dose so I'm hoping my hair will become healthier again. I'm on Humira now so hopefully it doesn't cause it too but it's gotten MUCH BETTER being on Humira. Also Entyvio didn't work for me for UC, it only has a 40% success rate. I was on it for 6 months.",Anonymous
2,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 25, 2021",0,"Had serum sickness on Remicaide due to extended gap in treatment, after failed treatment to conventional therapy. Rash and fever to Humira.I did very well on SYMPHONI. But....insurance refused to pay for the monthly injections (Medicare/supplement) 3  doses in. So I had  fatigue, hot flashes, minimal joint pain. Good results so far. I don't like going to office for infusions when self injection was going well.Company that produces this drug refused financial assistance. I retired from nursing after 46y in hospital setting.X",Deb
3,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 8, 2021",1,"Was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) 3 years ago. Put off entyvio again and again with my doctor but he kept pushing it and I finally gave in after a second hospitalization. I honestly can’t say if it helped my UC much at all. I lasted a little over a year on the infusions but wish I would have stopped it sooner.Tons of fatigue the day of/after infusions that seemed to steadily build with time into constant extreme fatigue. Hair loss (that hasn’t returned), general autonomic/CNS symptoms - migraines, numbness, worsening insomnia, and aching all over my body. I’d lie in bed at night and feel like my brain was on fire. I’ve been off of it a year and although my doc will deny lasting symptoms from the entyvio, a lot of the neurological symptoms have remained.Wish I hadn’t given in to my doc and stayed off of it by any means necessary. I was supposed to start medical school and likely won’t be able to now. Would highly advise against using it.",Andrew

5,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,2.0,,"March 12, 2021",24,"I’ve had UC for 37 years.I’ve been on Entyvio for 12 months. I chose to stop due to the debilitating side effects. I am in remission now, however the side effects are not worth it. After my first infusion I felt I was having a heart attack. The EMTs said my heart was fine but I was close to having a stroke. Cortisone injections eliminated this symptom. Over 8 treatments I developed severe bone and joint pain, some hair loss, major skin dryness and bruising, extreme fatigue, extreme chills and sweats, mouth sores constantly, 24/7 nausea and loss of appetite, some tremors, depression, boils appeared including around my eyes. I developed a serious eye infection after the 8th injection.The ophthalmologist said he’s only seen this type of eye infection in chemo patients .My olfactory senses became affected. Food started tasting different and fragrances seemed off. Entyvio did work but it’s clearly a toxic drug to where the quality of life is impacted severely in my case.",Peanut
6,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 22, 2021",3,It did absolutely nothing for my UC. I was unable to get off my Uceris without going into a serious flare again. I stayed on Entyvio for 5 months with no help. Waste of time and money. Disappointed.,Sara
7,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,10.0,,"January 19, 2021",11,"This is the first UC drug that I've seen an immediate and significant improvement from. It has given me my life back. After a nasty flare over a long period of time, Entyvio had me feeling better within the first few weeks. I have been in remission for over a year taking this every 8 weeks, this is the longest remission streak I've ever had since being diagnosed 15 years ago. For a day or two after the infusion I am VERY tired, have some joint pain and headaches, but they are relatively mild compared to a UC flare. I also find if I am sufficiently hydrated before and after the infusion the side effects are far less severe.",Brak102

Now my brain is foggy and I don’t feel normal. I will now have to go back to mesalamine   Beware and ask your Dr a lot of questions as this drug is really unproven. I know a person that had seizures after first dose of Humira and Dr also denied it had anything to do with Humira   These are similar compounds. Don’t be an experiment,Bob
9,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 12, 2020",47,"Entyvio was prescribed for my 8yr old son who was diagnosed with UC a little over a year ago. We have tried mesalamine, Remicade, Humira, budesonide, enemas, prednisone, GAPS / SCD diet. Mesalamine helped for a very short time, as did prednisone. My son is a primary non responder to both Remicade and Humira. He’s been hospitalized twice since diagnosis and his UC became much worse over the last 6 months. He was given Entyvio off label as it’s not typically prescribed for children. So far it has been a miracle drug for my child. After his second infusion he is so so much better. He has energy, a good appetite, and much less frequency. We can actually leave the house again for longer than 30 minutes. His only side effect so far is chronic runny / stuffy nose. Though he had this with both Remicade and Humira. He also suffered horrible migraines with previous biologics. None so far with Entyvio.",UCmom

I landed myself in the hospital during my initial diagnosis, for 1 month. Remicade saved me, but the side effects were awful. Stopped that and was in remission for 15 years. I had a flare in April 2020. I ended up in the hospital during this pandemic. Good times! Anyway, started taking prednisone and my gastro put me on Entyvio. I've had 3 infusions since May 2020 and I'm due for my next infusion in September, but I don't know if I can handle these side effects? My UC is under control, but at what cost? I just turned 40, I'm very active and would consider myself fairly fit/strong. I can barely walk after sitting for 5 minutes. My ankles swell up, my joints hurt to the bone. I'm so exhausted ALL THE TIME. I'm also a teacher and I will be starting back up with school in a few weeks. I cant imagine being on my feet all day.

12,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,5.0,,"April 4, 2020",26,"I have had UC since 2009. I have tried messalizine, imuran, remicade (for 4  months in 2013 after which I developed antibodies so had to stop) and entyvio (aug 2019 -nov 2019).   I tried entyvio in August 2019 after a stint in hospital in June 2019.  By 3rd infusion joint pains were unbearable so after 4 infusions I stopped.  In that time entyvio did help my symptoms by maybe 30 %. I shed hair on entyvio but it has recovered now. 6 months since my last infusion of entyvio  i still suffer horrible pains in wrists, ankles, fingers, elbows at all times of day and night. Usually one side only sometimes both sides equally.  The bones in my elbows hurt as though they have been badly bruised or someone took a hammer to them.

13,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 26, 2020",24,I was diagnosed with Ulcerative colitis (UC) 22 years ago. I was on medicines including ASACOL until I reached a remission that lasted for seven years and I thought I got back to normal and a flare up would never happen again until the last 7 months when I had the surprising flare and after the colonoscopy the doctor prescribed Prednisone and I took it for 3 months where I got better but with many side effects and they then said must continue with Humira as cortisone medicines must not be taken for so long. I started humira and had 7 injections with no improvement until they decided I should change to Entyvio on 24/01/2020 was my first infusion and until now my flare up is getting worse with no improvement and i feel so sick with severe abdominal pain and many bathroom visits a day..,Nina De Ricci

I was started on Entyvio back in October, it took a while for the effects to really start helping me get over this flare-up. But it's well worth it. I feel alive again, and not just like a ghost who haunts the bathroom. The side effects are a little annoying, like living in a constant state of stuffy/runny nose, sneezing, headaches and the FATIGUE. The day of the infusion I will fall asleep immediately and sleep most of the day, and for the rest of the week I deal with it. At my most recent appointment, my doctor said I had color to my face and I seemed a lot more alive.",Ash

16,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 18, 2020",13,Developed UC and started Entyvio about 3 years ago.  Hair immediately started falling out.  Also severe sleeplessness and hot flashes.  Days of not sleeping or if I did it would only be for 2 or 3 hours.  Had 20 to 30 hot flashes a day in the last year I took it and they would last at least 4 to 5 minutes then I would get really cold.  My UC was completely under control but the side effects were more than I could tolerate.  Started Humira about 8 months ago but have already had 2 flares. Now I don't know why the Gastro doctor didn't start me on Humira instead of Entyvio.,Anonymous
17,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 5, 2020",37,I was diagnosed with UC in 2017. I tried several medications with only partial reduction in symptoms. I have been on Entyvio for about 1.5 years now and my results are much improved with no side effects. I don’t get tired after injections and think I get a cold about as frequently as before starting Entyvio. I still get the occasional minor flare where I have some urgency or have to make a few extra trips to the bathroom a day but all in all I am in a much better place. I hope I can continue to use Entyvio for a long time.,EvanHimself

In December 2018, I had my 8 year since diagnosis colonoscopy and my GI couldn't believe I wasn't in the hospital with how inflamed my colon was. I was in pain but I learned to deal with it. Now, 7 months after starting Entyvio, I am wondering if the side effects are worth it. My colon is definitely better but I am constantly tired, my bones hurt, and I always seem to get sick a week or so before every infusion and wonder if I'll even be able to get it. The pain in my joints can be unbearable. I am going to see a rheumatologist to see if they can help me get this under control since my UC is finally in remission.",G

I had tried a majority of products on the market as of that time and it usually worked for a short period. You do feel some symptoms immediately after the infusion, primarily total fatigue and you usually sleep the rest of the day...or at least I do. Overall, the drug has done wonders for me as of lately. You still really need to watch what you eat, and restrain yourself from alcohol, but it’s worth it. I put back on the weight I lost from flare up and feel great.",University Student Guy!

24,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 22, 2019",58,Entyvio has saved my life. Prior to being diagnosed with UC they were treating me for diverticulitis with antibiotics which made everything worse. I was out of work the entire month of October ‘18. My hair was falling out in blobs prior to Entyvio due to the malnutrition I was suffering because my intestines could not absorb nutrients from what little food I could eat and keep in my body and I lost 37 pounds in a month. After starting Entyvio I could eat food again and started taking Biotin and a multi-vitamin.  My hair stopped falling out and I have been on the road to recovery for the last 10 months.,Lainie

Most meds work for a while and then stop. After 12 months of Humira, which helped somewhat but was inconsistent, I started on Entyvio in April 2018. After the first 2 infusions, I felt much better. I was closer to remission than I have been in years after the Week 6 infusion and continued feeling great for about a year.

It might be worth trying if it is a last resort but I wish I never tried it because I had no curative results or relief and I am so depressed that I am a bald woman.

These drugs could only help the upper portion of my colon, but not my proctitis, pain, urgency, and tenesmus. Entyvio worked for me!! Symptom free after ONE dose :) Going in my 4th dose.",MCC
47,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 18, 2018",17,Entyvio has been life changing for me. I have been dealing with UC for 18 years. Entyvio has worked better than any other treatments I have tried and I have had no side effects.,DC
48,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 31, 2018",16,This my third medicine we have tried for my colitis I had a severe reaction too remicade after using it for two years. I then was put on cimizia which didn't work. I then was put on Humira  which didn't work. This medicine is my last resort and it has saved my life.,MAC
49,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,3.0,,"March 13, 2018",12,"I have tried almost every medicine there is even entyvio but one medicine that I guarantee will help you is taking suboxone. Please take my advice when you have a whole film of suboxone cut them in 4 slices take just a quarter. I guarantee u that the diarrhea, the pains and everything else will go away. Suboxone  for Ulcerative colitis has been a miracle drug for me and has helped me be on remission for about 4 years. Now I had it when I was 23 I took suboxone at the age of 24 and I have been amazed. Subozone is used to treat people with addiction but it can be a miracle drug to other sickness. Please take my advice and at least give it a try I promise u it will work better then any drug. The doctors have no idea what works because they are not rocket scientist and they don't have what we have. We on the other hand know what works n what doesn't",Joey
50,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 15, 2018",17,Been on now for 5 months. Symptoms returned 2 months in. Dr wants to give it a good try so I'm back on Cortiment and awaiting a scope that he only has time for in June. Lost a lot of hair which is somewhat devastating for a woman who wants to feel normal and keep disability invisible. Dizziness and muscle weakness to the point of gym workouts not recovering for days.  So now I'm torn bc if I stop the meds and he does a scope in June he could say well we don't know if it worked you didn't give it enough time. It's a mental drain always trying to fix yourself and I think most people here wouldn't buy a fancy car if they won  heaps of money but rather diagnostic equipment. If it was possible to see what's really going on in their bodies. The unknown sucks. Getting naturopathic medicine and support and trying ketogenic diet along with fodmap and medical marijuana to help cope with the depression. I hope it's enough to keep me off these meds,Anonymous
51,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 14, 2018",10,"Entyvio has worked wonders for me the entire time I’ve been taking it— I finally feel like my ulcerative colitis is under control and I can finally breathe again for the first time in years without the anxiety or worry of my condition weighing me down. The infusion itself is the most inconvenient part, but the affects of the drug of severe colitis is definitely worth the inconvenience. I love it",Mkm98

I was given a third injection per the trial policy. I was then told I would no longer get the injections since it worked for me. I've been in remission since my last injection. I am still taking mesalamine. It has been several months and no symptoms . Thank God.",KMACK1
53,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,2.0,,"December 26, 2017",27,"DO NOT TAKE ENTYVIO!!! That is of course unless you want your immune system to shut down and be unable to fight off even the littlest common cold. Not to mention the crazy amount of debilitating side-effects. Headaches, sore muscles, major fatigue, restless leg syndrome, feeling like you want to throw up out of the blue, back pain and coughing.  Oh and IF you do happen to get a cold while you're already experiencing these side effects, you might as well times the pain by 3 and prepare for a very long recovery as your body is too weak to fight off any disease.As for my colitis symptoms..??  Entyvio almost TRIPLED my symptoms!!  CONSTANT diarrhea, NON-STOP abdominal discomfort and literally you are up all night.  AVOID BY ALL MEANS!",Chad n Roll

55,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,5.0,,"March 15, 2017",32,I just wanted to write to thank everyone for their feedback and advice. My gut feeling was to not go in this even though drs told me entyvio Is the best safest thing (apparently not ). I have a friend who's decided to go on it about 3 infusions now and not well.  Severe joint pain and sore bones throughout as well as dealing with rash and possible other autoimmune conditions that have not been verified yet if it's drug related.  All symptoms are since being on Entyvio.   I'm so glad that I followed my instincts and not the drug's/Dr.   Hoping for some better options that are safer for all of us !,Alexa123

57,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,4.0,,"February 13, 2017",26,"I haven't been able to tolerate any drug during the 5 years I have been officially flaring and diagnosed with UC. Despite this I know I had this nasty thing for the past 20 years. To put it plainly, Humira worked for 2 months, then failed. Now Entyvio worked for 1 month maybe and seems to be placebo now. I oscillate between very bad bloating and constipation and then diarrhea. Since on Entyvio I am unable to sleep laying down from the pain, and I have no ability to form a normal stool - it's either Diarrhea or it's pencil thin or pebble like. I do not feel like this medicine works and is just another step in the long journey toward surgery. I hear how biologics help people but I remain unconvinced.",Hallo78293

60,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 16, 2016",30,"After being allergic to all mesalamine drugs, remicade, and built up antibodies against Humira I was hopeful after my 4th treatment that I was finally in remission. Then the morning of my 5th treatment I go into the doctors office. About 15 minutes after my IV started I began to feel really light headed. I had a tight chest and my whole body felt heavy. This out of body feeling came over me and I was fixated on one spot of the room. Next thing I know I wake up to EMTs over me saying I had unresponsive pupils with hives. They said I was unresponsive to everyone around..I don't remember anything else until I got to the ER. If you start to feel dizzy-tell the nurse right away! Good luck to everyone.",Still praying for a cure.
61,Entyvio,Ulcerative Colitis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 16, 2016",31,"I thought Entyvio might have been the next best treatment, after I could no longer take Remicade and Humira. I started the injections in May and my ears started to bleed a week after the injection. After a month on the medication I have full body itching. Lastly, after five months on the medication I am also sneezing have patches of dark red angry rashes that are the size of a silver dollar. I would highly recommend close observation on this medication and speak to your doctor right away when any of these side effects occur. In my case they are only increasing with more exposure.",Dorkette
