1,Balsalazide,Ulcerative Colitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 22, 2019",2,"After three weeks, my sudden onset of ulcerative colitis hasn't cleared up much at all on Balsalazide. I set my alarm to take it three times a day, but my symptoms are still as bad as they were when I first called my doctor. I'm slated for steroids now. Boo!",Scout
2,Balsalazide,Ulcerative Colitis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 19, 2019",6,"I took Balsalazide off and on for about 5 months. It does not work at all. I have had diarrhea on it as I did before I started taking it. My stomach pain has not improved either.And It’s really annoying to take 9 capsules every single day, they are quite big too.Not effective for me -_-",Didn’t work
3,Balsalazide,Ulcerative Colitis,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 6, 2018",5,"This works well to control UC quickly; 3 BD puts flare-ups in remission within a couple days.  I spare my liver & stop taking it as often when I'm otherwise behaving well (diet, exercise, stress mgmt).  Interesting that people report rashes as a side effect, as I get rashes only during flares (not related to meds).  And it's on Kaiser's (N. Cal) formulary - so thankful!",bean

9,Balsalazide,Ulcerative Colitis,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 11, 2012",24,"I take 3 of the 750mg capsules 3 times a day for my ulcerative colitis and have seen that as long as I make sure to take them at the same times every day, then it works very well and flare ups are few. The capsules are easy to swallow and the medication itself has been very easy on my stomach.",thewhitechickoj
10,Balsalazide,Ulcerative Colitis,8.0,,"January 27, 2011",20,Colazal (balsalazide):Cheaper than some other medicines. It's my wonder drug.,Anonymous
11,Balsalazide,Ulcerative Colitis,7.0,,"November 24, 2010",11,Colazal (balsalazide):This medicine really helped me get in remission about 6 years ago. I'm still taking it as a maintenance drug- but I have been flaring up for the past 2 years while taking it. Prednisone has been my savior as far as the flaring up. Next step...Remicade. We will see how it goes!,Anonymous
