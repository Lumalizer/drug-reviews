0,Stelara,Ulcerative Colitis,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 22, 2022",3,"Ok, I have done Remicade, Humira, Imuran, prednisone, etc. Stelara took a few months to work and I had to be moved from every 8 weeks to 6 weeks, but once I moved to 6 weeks. I went into complete remission of my UC and HORRIFIC joint pain. I have currently been in remission and prednisone free for 8 months",works great
1,Stelara,Ulcerative Colitis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 3, 2021",11,"All I can say is this drug has been a life saver. If you are reading this, youâ€™ve probably already tried other medications by now. For me, initially I tried Remacaid. After a few infusions, no success. Then I tried Entyvio. Same result. Getting very discouraged, I now tried Xeljanz. No improvement at all. This was all over a year and a half. I was starting to come to the realization that surgery was my only option. Then my Gastroenterolgist suggested Stelara which although known to be treated for rheumatoid arthritis, recent studies have shown success with ulcerative colitis. After my first treatment, I started seeing my symptoms improving. After my second treatment I was seeing drastic changes to point where my bowel movements were down to 2-3x per day, down from 10-15. Today, I can proudly say I am in remission and am leading a normal life, back to a regular diet and normal bowel movements. I can honestly say I owe my life to this drug and am thankful every day for it.",Adam
