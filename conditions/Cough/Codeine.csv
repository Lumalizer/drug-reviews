0,Codeine,Cough,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 1, 2016",14,"more than a decade of a horrible chronic cough, doc put me on codeine and whatever damage it might be doing to my body, it has been well worth it.  I have had to increase dosage considerably but so far I have not become immune, thank god, because I don't want to live coughing like I have in the past.  No side effects that are negative.",Bunnyomer
1,Codeine,Cough,10,,"June 19, 2009",17,"I could barely breath or eat when I had bronchitis. When I took codeine I could at least drink water and eat noodles. I don't know how I would have survived without it. Although I had to quit taking it before I finished my prescription because it made me feel ""drunk"" if I don't have major pain.",ahays
