1,Mucinex,Cough,1.0,,"December 8, 2021",0,I spent $21.00 on mucinex day and night  cough medicine and cough drops . I was disappointed the product didn’t do anything. Would love a refund .,Patrice

4,Mucinex,Cough,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 13, 2020",1,The  packaging for Mucinex  is a horrible nightmare. I could not open the bottle. I did the usual push down and turn knob but it was impossible. My dr suggested this and other drugs and antibiotics but I couldn’t get it open - I am so sick that I took a knife to the lid but it only produced a small slit. So I squeezed the bottle but only got a little out. This is a nightmare and I will never buy this again.   Zero time on med as I could not get to it.,Joody
5,Mucinex,Cough,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 12, 2020",7,This has to be the worse cough medicine ever it actually made my cough worse. Switch to Robitussin and IMMEDIATELY noticed the difference in relief. I'm not one to review but this one needed to go down in the books.... Don't take Mucinex...,H
6,Mucinex,Cough,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2020",25,At first I thought this was making me worse because of thinning my mucus but I read someone's comment on here who said to drink a lot of water (64 oz) and I tried that and it definitely made a difference. If you don't drink a lot of water with this you are not going to clear out the mucus.,Linda

8,Mucinex,Cough,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 13, 2020",5,I use the Mucinex liquid and I think it works great. I had it as a prescription for my last cold and this time I got it myself. I also got Alka Seltzer thinking that would work. After 3 days of feeling like poo I took the Mucinex and slept the best I had in three days. I highly recommend this to anyone. I'm only taking it at night because it does make me sleepy. Other than that I have no problems with this medicine and it's the best thing I've ever taken for colds.,Jojo

12,Mucinex,Cough,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 15, 2018",12,"I have had a chronic cough for about 20 yrs.  After many tests for asthma, GERD, other lung problems was diagnoised with Neurogenic cough.  In other words, they don't know what's causing it.  I've tried Amitryptiline and a couple other scripts didn't do much and had horrible side effects.  I started using the Mucinex12  hr time release.  They calm my cough pretty good.  I've been taking them this time about a month and had my bp checked yesterday by a nurse and it was 181/98.  We checked it twice with her machine and checked it twice with mine.  All four readings were in the 180's/90-100+.  Now just a couple months ago my reading was 122/78.  That is more normal for me.  The Mucinex is one of two changes I have made in my life within the last two months.  The other was starting the Keto Diet Sept 24th...  Has anyone else experienced problems with their bp after taking Mucinex DX?  Maybe I'm not drinking enough water.  I don't know, but I'm definitely concerned...",CJ
13,Mucinex,Cough,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 8, 2018",16,I am coughing up of all kinds of mucus and I want to sleep.. that's not going to happen.  Wish I never took it.,Bonnie
14,Mucinex,Cough,,,"February 7, 2018",12,I had the flu and night coughing was keeping the family from sleeping.  I tried everything!!  This worked the first night.  I noticed it made my throat feel dry & sore.  Drink plenty of water.,Melfel
15,Mucinex,Cough,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 4, 2018",12,"Worked well after I started guzzling water. It did nothing before that. Thing is, nowhere on the liquid Musinex DM packaging does it say to ensure to drink lots of water. If water is essential to its effectiveness, I’d think the company would want folks to get plenty hydrated. This method combined with an inhaler to calm coughing spasms and I feel progress in kicking my flu remnants. Good luck.",Eartheditor
16,Mucinex,Cough,8.0,,"October 15, 2017",7,"Out of a dozen over the counter and homebrew/natural remedies for persistent cough (which lasted well after any other symptoms of the cold virus/mild flu that I experienced a month or more ago) that I tried, Mucinex DM is the only one to give me any real relief from an urge to cough thru the day.  I sleep just fine but don't feel anything like post nasal drip, or acid reflux or any obvious culprit. I did go to the clinic that I could afford to, got a shot, an inhaler and an antibiotics script. That worked a bit, for about a week, but when the cough came back, Mucinex did just about the same job. Not a perfect solution by any means but when I compared it to the other brands of things tried it was fine",AnonymousScott
17,Mucinex,Cough,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 13, 2017",28,"I had a Cough, runny nose, allergies, Then lungs got congested and major wheezing. Normally I will just take cetirizine when its allergy season, but this time my chest was in play. I looked all over the house for my bottle of Mucinex. Couldn't find it. I suffered for a couple of days with a nasty cough and gook in my lungs trying to sleep and make it through the day. After realizing I left it at our 2nd home I headed for the store. Bought the 1200mg time release (1st time), usually, I would get the 600mg. Within an hour the wheezing stopped. I am writing this comment because it works fabulously for me. I have told many of my friends and it has worked for them. Not one complaint. When I have chest congestion I will always take Mucinex. It truly works. For those that say it doesn't work, I find that hard to believe.",Matteo B
18,Mucinex,Cough,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 10, 2017",9,"I have taken Mucinex for many years with no ill effects, but during this latest bout with chest congestion, when I took it , each of the three times,  I experienced horrible, horrible nightmares.  My adult daughter had a similar experience  when taking it a few months ago. Was this a new ""batch"" of ingredients or were alternatives used? I have no idea what might have caused this reaction, but I am very wary of trying it again.",Anonymous

22,Mucinex,Cough,5.0,,"December 23, 2016",19,"The doctor gave me a sample of this when I complained of congestion. I took two tablets, which may have been too much since I developed the runs. I'll try it again, but only one tablet. Or, I may just get Robitussin since the doctor said that Mucinex is a magnified version of Robitussin.",CongestedKelley

I took one pill yesterday and felt a little better. That was a half does so today I tried 2 pills, a full dose.

26,Mucinex,Cough,6.0,,"May 15, 2016",38,"I was suffering from a severe virus-caused sore throat with terrible coughing.  My PCP advised me to take Mucinex but at substantially greater dosage than the package recommends.  I did so for about 3-4 weeks.  The medication did help relieve my coughing, but it interfered so badly with my sleep that I had to discontinue taking it.  I notice that other people have experienced sleep problems with Mucinex.   There should be a warning about this on the package label.",Captain Jerry
27,Mucinex,Cough,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 2, 2016",26,"I would give this a zero out of ten if it was possible. I rarely get sick but I have been having a lot of trouble with a runny nose and coughing up mucus. This ""medicine"" doesn't do anything. Not only does it taste terrible but it's useless. Followed instructions and I'm on day 7 with the same problems. Avoid this stuff",sy91
28,Mucinex,Cough,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 13, 2015",57,"One of the best thing for coughs.  The Mucinex DX green does a great job of thinning mucus as well as stopping cough. The blue is good for colds and allergies without cough. I prefer the 600 mg tables. For me, they wear off after five hours. Take with a lot of water. The more water the better it works.  16ozs every 90 minutes makes it work the best.",EricfromNC
29,Mucinex,Cough,10.0,,"October 28, 2015",32,"I swear by this stuff. (I'm talking about Musinex's version of TheraFlu, it's fairly new-maybe last year it was put on the shelves) I have tried nearly every cold remedy in the history of the world from teas to drugs to more wholesome remedies but nothing has actually ever worked. This stuff actually reduces the duration of my colds and the severity of colds within the first day. Drink it in the morning and once before bed and you should be golden in 2 days. I'm more of that summertime cold-getter and it works like magic every time.",HaleyR
30,Mucinex,Cough,8.0,,"March 24, 2015",27,"I have been taking Mucinex for about 5 months.... one in a.m. and another at 8pm.   I took it because I could not swallow any phlegm and it was difficult coughing it up.  My esophagus muscles are very weak and the phlegm would block my air waves.Recently I have developed severe dry mouth as a side affect.  I stopped the p.m. pill, and use biotene gel, toothpaste and mouth rinse.... still no relief.  If anyone has had this problem, please let me know.",Mattie138

After taking Mucinex, my cough and the associated Phlegm has almost disappeared.

38,Mucinex,Cough,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 3, 2013",40,"Actually I was using Mucinex to control a nagging night time cough. Although I had extreme pain in my ankles and legs EVERY SINGLE DAY, I never dreamed that Mucinex would have any effect as to helping that. I took a dose of the Mucinex FastMax just before I went to bed and WOW, no cough AND no leg pain at all that night, at last I was pain free! I know it had to be the Mucinex because absolutely nothing else had made a difference! I will keep some on hand to use from now on. I hope this helps someone else also. Thank you.",sutraquio

After about a week of taking Mucinex, my cough was slightly better, but I noticed that my endometriosis had subsided!  I have been suffering from endometriosis for the past 20  years...tried eveything (Nafarelin, birth control bills, laparoscopic surgery, pregnancy, Lupron depot, ovariohysterectomy) and nothing helped the pain...I felt like my urinary bladder was under constant pressure and the only relief was immediately after urinating, but the pain would immediately return.  I saw several urologists and they tried treating me for overactive bladder and interstitial cystitis, but the only definitive diagnosis was endometriosis.",Grateful in Fremont

44,Mucinex,Cough,8.0,,"August 10, 2009",34,"This helped with a nasty cold when other OTC mixtures (with less guaifenesin) did not work. The 600mg tab has almost no side effects, though once in a while can make me feel woozy. Made a huge difference in loosening phlegm, helping me sleep, reduced coughing so my vocal chords are not as irritated. Also, my nasal passages cleared up significantly the first day I took it.  It's important NOT to split the tab, it is hard to swallow, but it's formulated as sustained-release.  It can't do it's job over 12 hours unless it is taken whole. Also, drinking lots of fluids (not coffee, tea) does help. Miracle drug (Mucinex)!",Anonymous
