1,Benadryl,Cough,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 21, 2018",28,"I have had a cough now for about 6 weeks. I tried all types of antihistamines, even prescribed cough syrup and expectorants.  The only thing that finally stopped the cough and even at night time was Benadryl.  I wish I had known this weeks ago.  I can even sleep at night without the night and morning cough. Thank goodness for  Benadryl!",Lori
2,Benadryl,Cough,9.0,,"January 7, 2012",38,"Variant asthma, chronic, have been on many antihistamines and other costly asthma medicines over the years.  I began taking Benadryl in late November 2011. Taking 25 mg after awakening in the morning followed an hour or so later with 25 mg with another 25mg early afternoon (when symptoms occur) and 25 mg prior to bedtime in conjunction with Symbicort twice/day. I have a much improved quality of life and am beginning to have some control over the chronic cough. ",Anonymous
