0,Hydromorphone,Cough,8,,"February 5, 2019",22,"Dilaudid (hydromorphone):I take Dilaudid for severe chronic migraines, for which it is a godsend. I have now developed acute bronchitis (I assume), related to a recent chest cold. The Dilaudid has really calmed my incessant hacking, and also helps any accompanying headache. I'm also taking ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and antihistamines regularly, which seems to help. I guess time is the only real cure â€” ugh!",imchipper
