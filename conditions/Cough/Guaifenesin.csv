1,Guaifenesin,Cough,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 14, 2021",0,YoooI know every body is different but this stuff acted is so awful for me . I was unable to sleep because of post nasal drip and a cough so I decided to take one dose of the children's version of guaifenesin. After one hour I suddenly got extremely dizzy and was violently vomiting. I think that's over now that it's out of my system hopefully but lord knows I will never ever take this stuff again. I felt like I was going to die. The irony is I took this to help with a sore throat from the post nasal drip but now my throat hurts even worse than before because of the vomiting. I hope this reaction isn't common for people. I wouldn't wish my experience on anyone.,CJ L

I did the usual push down and turn knob but it was impossible. My dr suggested this and other drugs and antibiotics but I couldn’t get it open - I am so sick that I took a knife to the lid but it only produced a small slit.

I sleep just fine but don't feel anything like post nasal drip, or acid reflux or any obvious culprit. I did go to the clinic that I could afford to, got a shot, an inhaler and an antibiotics script.

I took a dose of the Mucinex FastMax just before I went to bed and WOW, no cough AND no leg pain at all that night, at last I was pain free! I know it had to be the Mucinex because absolutely nothing else had made a difference! I will keep some on hand to use from now on. I hope this helps someone else also. Thank you.",sutraquio

I have been suffering from endometriosis for the past 20  years...tried eveything (Nafarelin, birth control bills, laparoscopic surgery, pregnancy, Lupron depot, ovariohysterectomy) and nothing helped the pain...I felt like my urinary bladder was under constant pressure and the only relief was immediately after urinating, but the pain would immediately return.

82,Guaifenesin,Cough,8.0,,"August 10, 2009",34,"Mucinex (guaifenesin):This helped with a nasty cold when other OTC mixtures (with less guaifenesin) did not work. The 600mg tab has almost no side effects, though once in a while can make me feel woozy. Made a huge difference in loosening phlegm, helping me sleep, reduced coughing so my vocal chords are not as irritated. Also, my nasal passages cleared up significantly the first day I took it.  It's important NOT to split the tab, it is hard to swallow, but it's formulated as sustained-release.  It can't do it's job over 12 hours unless it is taken whole. Also, drinking lots of fluids (not coffee, tea) does help. Miracle drug (Mucinex)!",Anonymous
