0,Amitriptyline,Cough,10,,"May 10, 2012",124,"I have had a productive cough off and on for over 24 years (more on than off) have seen many ENTs, allergists, gastroenterologist and they say it is acid reflux.  I am on three acid blockers a day with no relief. The Elavil has STOPPED THE COUGH. I feel free and happy and so grateful that I read about the off label use of this medicine.  Thank you Elavil.",Anonymous
