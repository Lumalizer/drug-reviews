0,Diflucan,Candida Urinary Tract Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 24, 2021",2,"It would have been very nice to have known beforehand that Difucan contains fluoride, which messes with iodine. I have thyroid problems and bipolar, so it is been real fun puking my brains out while having a complete breakdown. This stuff also has the added plus of switching your yeast infection to a bacterial infection.",kuno78
1,Diflucan,Candida Urinary Tract Infection,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 27, 2020",19,"Okay umm...I was diagnosed of candida 2014 and was given different antifungal which seemed to work for the mean time. Then In 2015 I had a re infection, symptoms were similar to the last one. So diflucan was recommended 150mg single dose and ketoconazole cream. On taking the single dose diflucan I got a lot better after 3 hours it was such a relief, the itching, burning and inflammation stopped. This is 2020 and currently on another dose and it's working perfectly... I recommend this drug 100%",Chilux
2,Diflucan,Candida Urinary Tract Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 22, 2018",12,"I was prescribed just 2 pills after getting antibiotics for a UTI and an ear infection just in case. They were to be taken 7 days apart. The morning after taking 1 I had nearly all the side effects mentioned for this drug. I didn’t read the side effects beforehand and psych myself out. I just wondered why my stomach was so bloated, painful miserable gas, constant BM, 0 appetite and worsts of all I had shortness of breath! Then, 24 hrs later, I remembered I had taken this the night before and looked up negative side effects. I will not be taking the other pill! If I ever get a true yeast infection, I will use the 1 day ovule that has no side effects! Can’t wait til this leaves my system which says it stay in your system for several days :(",K8s1

4,Diflucan,Candida Urinary Tract Infection,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2015",33,"Amazing drug. After trying everything for a week to get rid of the worst yeast infection of my life, I was prescribed Diflucan. Within 15 minutes, no lie, yeast started dumping from my body. Kinda gross but that's what was making me feel so horrible and frustrated had waited a few days after Monastat didn't work. But word to the wise, drink lots of water after you take this; there so many toxins that get released into your body when yeast dies off, especially that fast. I drank a lot of water and didn't experience side effects or headaches with this med.",SavingCinderella
