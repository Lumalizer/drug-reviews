0,Celebrex,Period Pain,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 6, 2014",32,I have extremely painful periods. I'm talking pain so bad I cry and want to go to ER. I was given this to help with arthritis. And just happen to start same day well I took one and they are doable now I'm not doubled over crying. Don't get me wrong it still hurts but not nearly as bad.,usmckillsmom
