1,Voltaren,Period Pain,9,,"March 16, 2009",63,"My doctor prescribed Voltaren after an extremely painful IUD insertion and subsequent cramping. I've never had cramps like these before. I'd literally be curled up in the fetal position, unable to even talk. Depending on the level of pain, this either completely eradicated it or made it totally bearable, and lasted for 12 hours at a stretch. Voltaren is wonderful and I'm glad my doctor recommended it over a narcotic painkiller.",SactoGal
