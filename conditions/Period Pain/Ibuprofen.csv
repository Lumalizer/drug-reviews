1,Ibuprofen,Period Pain,8.0,,"October 19, 2021",1,"I always use it, and sometimes it is good as a pain reliever but sometimes it does not work or has little effect. I'm worried about the effect that it really causes sudden death.",charli roman

I took 2 as the first dose because I have intense menstrual pain, but nothing happened. I waited for an hour before taking another one, hoping it would kick in, yet still nothing happened. I guess I can't say I'm surprised; nothing has ever helped my cramps. At this point I just need to see a doctor asap.",Princess
5,Ibuprofen,Period Pain,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 4, 2020",13,"Advil Liquid Gel is the only pain reliever that has worked for me. I pop a 400mg every 6 hours or so for the first three days of period. I suggest also if your heavy flow happens on days off where you don't have to leave the house, try just making yourself comfy and sit on the toilet all day and let things keep flowing out. It definitely makes a huge difference especially when combined with Advil that now I have a dedicated pillow, blanket, foot stool and phone charger stashed in my washroom cupboard.",Ackna
6,Ibuprofen,Period Pain,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 22, 2020",11,I’ve been taking 800 mg of ibuprofen for severe period cramps since last September but it’s like trying to put out a house fire with a squirt gun for all the good it feels like it does. It feels like if I take one or four advil or more Advil throughout the day the most relief I get is extremely minor and I’m still bedridden and in pain enough to wake me up crying in the middle of the night. High strength ibuprofen (800 mg per pill) is all I’ve been prescribed for the pain by my old doctor but I’m looking for a new one. Works good for headaches though.,Sad Student

I get weak and have painful cramps, can't function. Feels like having a miscarriage every time. Taking 800mg ibuprofen doesn't touch my pain. Midol is the only thing that helps. Until I was recently put on the generic form of mobic. This has been a high relief for me. I started at 11 years old, and am 43 now. I don't like taking it everyday, but it was prescribed for arthritis and has been a life saver!!!",Trs

I tried using other remedies but TBH none of them work (even for weed). I normally feel very weak on my first day of period and I almost can’t feel any blood in my limbs.

18,Ibuprofen,Period Pain,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 26, 2019",10,"IMPORTANT: TAKE ANY PAINKILLER THE DAY BEFORE EXPECTED CRAMPS!!! I have found all pain medication to be much more likely to be effective this way. If pain already exists, it doesnt normally seem to do much of anything. I just suffer in agony for hours, sometimes on and off all day long due to severe symptoms. I don't know why that would be, but there you have it. Even hours after taking any painkiller, I tend to feel little to no relief if I havent pre-dosed.",onelove salvia

27,Ibuprofen,Period Pain,8.0,,"July 25, 2017",7,I've had bad period cramps since I started menstruating. I used ibuprofen but 400 mg every four to six hours was not enough; I was afraid to take more until I read the prescription dosage for arthritis was as high as 3200 mg per day. I bumped my dosage up to 600 mg per dose and that made a huge difference. I recommend talking to a doctor or pharmacist about how much to take if the typical dose isn't working for you.,Pam9
28,Ibuprofen,Period Pain,1.0,,"January 14, 2017",8,"Poor!Obviously a male must've been the person the person behind the making of these tablets because they are poor! Too mild. When a woman takes painkillers for menstrual pains, it means they don't want to feel anything! But these tabs don't eradicate the pain like other regular pains do. In face, nurofen plus is far much better than the one for menstrual pains. I just think this was another way to expand their product line in the market to increase their customer base and profits! Nurofen guys, relook at it please!",Khemi
