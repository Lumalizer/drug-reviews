0,Motrin,Period Pain,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 30, 2020",10,"I had the most excruciating period pain and couldn’t even get out of bed. I tried everything and nothing helped until my cousin gave me motrin. With motrin I don’t feel any pain and don’t suffer from symptons nausea, depression, mood swings and now I can function normally. I can not believe I find something to stop to pain, I’m truly fascinated and recommend motrin to anyone",Nadja
