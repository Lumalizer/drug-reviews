0,Celecoxib,Period Pain,9,,"October 31, 2016",5,"I have tried just about every drug on the market for my cramps and after a while they all just stop working. I took Bextra and Vioxx which are similar before they were taken off the market. I take it a day before my period starts and usually only a few days into the week and finally I'm not missing out on life or work anymore. I do get blood tests to check for any abnormalities, but after 3 years there are none so far. I take the brand name, simply because the manufacturer co-pay makes it $4 a month, which is less than my $7 month co-pay with my insurance. Both my parents take this for their arthritis now and my 26 year old sister just started this for her cramps. I'm constantly telling everyone how much I love Celebrex.",kismetangel
1,Celecoxib,Period Pain,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 6, 2014",32,Celebrex (celecoxib):I have extremely painful periods. I'm talking pain so bad I cry and want to go to ER. I was given this to help with arthritis. And just happen to start same day well I took one and they are doable now I'm not doubled over crying. Don't get me wrong it still hurts but not nearly as bad.,usmckillsmom
