0,Aleve,Period Pain,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 26, 2022",0,I have had the worst period pain ever accompanied with heavy flow and clots that I was changing my sanitary pads every 2 hours and sometimes even 45 mins. The pain was so bad that I could barely walk or do anything. Lying on bed didn’t even help. Aleve has been a life saver. It helps in reducing the pain so quickly and I am able to at-least sit on my bed without having to feel that I am going to faint.,SSS

7,Aleve,Period Pain,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 28, 2019",11,"I have stage 4 Endometriosis and in turn have terrible period cramps. I took Advil for years, but found that it always made me nauseous and just feel really out of it. I finally took the suggestion on my friends who has bad period pain and took Aleve.

8,Aleve,Period Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 27, 2018",8,"This is my first time using Aleve and it has worked wonders for me. I cannot believe how well it has worked so far! I have had severe cramps since I was 12 years and have tried so many pain relievers that haven't worked so well. I took 2 pills about 20 minutes after I started cramping and 20 minutes later, I was all good! For 24 hours! The third day is usually my worst but I took two pills and I was good for about 17 hours then I took 1 pill and I was good for another 9 hours. And it doesn't make me nauseated! So glad I found this, I just hope it keeps on working like this.",shukrani12
9,Aleve,Period Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 13, 2018",9,"I too cannot believe how well Aleve works! I've had bad cramps, pain and misery that lasted for two days, interrupting my life every month and giving a feeling of dread each time 'that time' approached. My sister mentioned recently that Aleve helped her, so I tried it. For the second month now, I am able to function with pretty mild symptoms! It's a miracle. So happy to have found this!! Wish I'd known about it 10 years ago, to think the suffering was so simply solved. So grateful.",Isabell22

11,Aleve,Period Pain,10.0,,"November 14, 2017",10,"Aleve has been a miracle drug for me. I’m not one to write reviews on anything but I can tell you from my experience today that I was in so much pain from menstrual cramps that I was crying. I took two extra strength Tylenol and it took two hours to work and when it did work I still felt a lot of pain but still not as much as before. Then, I took two Aleve and it completely knocked it out.",Hildie89
12,Aleve,Period Pain,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 12, 2016",16,Aleve is the only pain killer that really helps. I used to take a double dose of extra strong Midol and it would last me maybe 4 hours. With the Aleve I take 1 every 11-12 hours and I am good for the day.,Ang101

16,Aleve,Period Pain,10.0,,"August 12, 2011",56,"This medicine saved me.  Starting about the age of 15 I began to experience menstrual cramps for the first time.   It was the very worst pain I had ever felt at that time.  Not content to only hurt in my lower abdomen the pain radiated all the way down the front of my legs to my ankles.  I couldn't sit still.  All I could do was pace back and forth crying.  I couldn't find a single pain reliever that worked; we had the usual in the house, aspirin, ibuprofen, even Midol.  Finally my mother became so worried she took me to the doctor.  I thought I was going to have to be on some kind of strong prescription medication.  What does he do, he returns to the room with about 50 samples of Aleve and it has been my miracle drug ever since.",bethmed
