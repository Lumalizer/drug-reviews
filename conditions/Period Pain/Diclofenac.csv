1,Diclofenac,Period Pain,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 19, 2022",0,"Cataflam (diclofenac):First days of my period are always bad. I usually take an algopyrin with no-spa in the morning it starts, and it lasts 2-3 hours at max. Regardless of whether I take it before the pain starts or after. With cataflam, it's even worse. I took it before the pain started. Nothing for 30 mins-1hour, then the pain slowly started to creep in. 2 hours later, and it's like I haven't even taken anything, if not worse. It hurts a lot. So for me, it's a big no. As good as this pill was for toothache, it does seriously nothing for period pain for me. For my sister, it works wonders though. So it really is a hit or miss. At least it's easy to swallow.",Shortcake

I was able to sleep and work without  feeling pain making my menstrual days painless. However, blood flow is less ( I’m a heavy bleeder) and looks darker which is worrying. I think there’s a scientific explanation to this and really need an answer to that. Finally, there are months that I’ll throw up continuously after taking this painkiller.",Anonymous

16,Diclofenac,Period Pain,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 21, 2020",17,I stumbled upon this drug diclofenac for my period pain and I am so thankful that I did. I take the 100mg diclomol and I've been taking it for almost 12 years now. My dad would use it for arthritis pain and one day when I was 18 I was cramping with my period and decided to try it and VOILA pain was gone. Nothing else worked for me from brustan (this would last like two hours and I'd be in pain again) to ibuprofen and panadol. So since that day I've always used this medicine. It even got me through my copper IUD insertion and the PAINFUL CRAMPS that came with it. I've had my IUD for two years and diclomol still works when I have period pain just like it did before my IUD. I really recommend this drug however if you have acidity issues please don't take it. I also love the fact that it's  a slow release tablet and I don't need to take more than one even in a day or two if the pain is really severe. Currently on my period and an hour ago I was in pain but now the relief is so good. Girls try it!!!,Lovediclo

64,Diclofenac,Period Pain,9.0,,"March 16, 2009",63,"Voltaren (diclofenac):My doctor prescribed Voltaren after an extremely painful IUD insertion and subsequent cramping. I've never had cramps like these before. I'd literally be curled up in the fetal position, unable to even talk. Depending on the level of pain, this either completely eradicated it or made it totally bearable, and lasted for 12 hours at a stretch. Voltaren is wonderful and I'm glad my doctor recommended it over a narcotic painkiller.",SactoGal
