0,Naproxen,Period Pain,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 2, 2022",0,"Miricle dug for me. i finally convinced my GP doctor to prescribe me this after suffering for years with such bad period cramps I would be on the floor crying, throwing up, unable to function or socialize. Midol, Advil and heating pads didn't do anything. X-rays and ultrasounds showed no underlying issues like endometriosis and overlain cysts. I take two 500mgs morning and night the first two days of my cycle. I am pain free and the horrible bloating is way down. I don't know what I would do without this drug. I'm worried about it causing ulcers so I take it during the worst days with milk.",Lynne
1,Naproxen,Period Pain,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 26, 2022",0,Aleve (naproxen):I have had the worst period pain ever accompanied with heavy flow and clots that I was changing my sanitary pads every 2 hours and sometimes even 45 mins. The pain was so bad that I could barely walk or do anything. Lying on bed didn’t even help. Aleve has been a life saver. It helps in reducing the pain so quickly and I am able to at-least sit on my bed without having to feel that I am going to faint.,SSS

The first day of my cycle is the worst and this stopped the extreme throwing-up crying pain I used to have with no diognosis of endometriosis or anything. Be careful though. It's very hard on the stomach if taken often, remember to take it with food. One or two doses really helped me with cramps when nothing else did.",Anonymous

Like everyone here, my periods were really bad since I first got them at age 13. At age 14 I got on the pill and my period problems disappeared, but I decided to get off the pill at age 24 (about 2 and a half years ago). The period cramps came back, and my doctor recommended naproxen a few days before my period. I also double up with Tylenol and I no longer dread my period. It’s still uncomfortable, but not painful. Highly recommend! Ibuprofen did not work the same way for me.",Han

Allowed me to function on a daily basis until I got my endometriosis diagnosis. Didn’t completely alleviate my pain but made it manageable and didn’t make me too drowsy to go about my business. Also is great for migraines if I catch them early enough. The only downsides are that I did have to increase my dose over the years and it is hard on the stomach.,M.

I take Naproxen a few days before my period begins and then every 12 hours for the most painful days of my period and it is so much less debilitating. I HIGHLY recommend Naproxen to anyone, but the kicker is this: you have to take Naproxen BEFORE your cramps begin or right as they’re about to get worse.
