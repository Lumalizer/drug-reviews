1,Amlodipine,High Blood Pressure,1.0,,"March 28, 2022",0,I started taking metaproplol  25 mg for high BP a couple months ago it wasn't agreeing . So my Dr. started me on Amlodipine 5 mg a day. My blood pressure has been great but the side affects are unbearable. I thought I was loosing my mind and I like to think of myself as a stable person. After 2 weeks of anxiety attacks vivid odd dreams dry mouth like I have never seen I started taking half the pill thinking it might help. Nope no change I am done with this drug and it has been by far the worst month of my life. Thanks to all the reviews I read today to assure me that I am not alone and this drug should be taken off the market. I am calling my Dr. today and going to start walking every day.

I’ve never experienced side effects or discomfort like I’ve been feeling for the past 6 months. I’ve been trying to ride it out thinking the side effects would fade away like the cardiologist said but no, this drug has been effecting my life from my 3 beautiful kids & wife. I was working a full time job cleaning houses (would clean 3 houses by myself in a day shift) now I can barely sweep my home floors without being fatigued. The side effects ruin my 2021 past Christmas & Thanksgiving. I’m so happy I’ve read these reviews and I thought I was all alone experiencing these episodes of severe dizziness, lightheadedness, tightness in the chest area, nausea, fatigue, tiredness, feeling fainting symptoms, Confusion, mood swings, dry mouth, pressure in the neck head area, Bad anxiety, anxious and nervousness and depression.",Anonymous

4,Amlodipine,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 17, 2022",0,I started the medicine and within 3 weeks of increasing to 5 mg I started having really bad irritability.  This is not something I ever ever get. Then after a week the depression set in and it was extremely bad. I was exhausted all the time and I'm usually very very active I lost motivation to do most things. After being on this for 45 days I stopped cold turkey. There was absolutely no way I was going to put any more of this into my body as my mood grew worse and worse. I would rather have high blood pressure than deal with torturous depression. I see many reviews stated that they got anxiety and this was not the case for me it was severe depression. I do want to say that the medication was very effective at lowering my blood pressure. My blood pressure ran 180 over 100 and it has been really hard for me to find an effective medication. This one brought it down to 120 over 85. So it definitely works but the side effects far outweigh the benefits.,Never again

BP didn’t lower, actually got higher along with heart rate.  Woke up in middle of night with heart thudding each night I was on it. Had to get up and walk around the house trying to calm myself, felt as if I might have a heart attack.  It caused severe anxiety, aggravation and agitation. And I was on it for only 6 days!   Doctor had me stop taking it and has me monitoring BP etc for now as it works it’s way out of my system.  Evidently there is some ingredient in the makeup of this drug that my system can’t tolerate.

My pulse is always very high (90’s) which is a known side effect that my GP isn’t  concerned about; but I am. I also my periodontist diagnosed me  with gingival hyperplasia ( \condition where the gums swell and begin to cover the teeth) Another side effect but it is considered very rare affecting only 0.01% of patients. Luckily mine was in the early stage and hopefully I can avoid corrective surgery. I always seem to experience the rare side effects and even allergic reactions to medication.

Numerous doctors for leg swelling... heart palpitations (I wore a heart monitor because my heart was beating too fast- but slowed down while sleeping to 2 seconds per beat) I had no idea what was going on.  ENDLESS doctors appointments and treatments!    I was also losing my hair. It was falling out in clumps.

His dizzyness got a little better but was still having trouble remembering events that were happening. Now the dizzy spells are bad enough I am afraid he is going to fall.

I take it in the morning and in the afternoon my pressure is better but when I take my pressure in the morning it’s still around 130/90.The biggest positive was migraine prevention. I haven’t had one in three weeks and I don’t think I ever would again if I stayed on this drug but I will not take this drug going forward. The side effects are too severe. My feet and ankles swell. I have a bad taste in my mouth. My insomnia is worse. The biggest problem is fatigue. In the afternoon I feel like a zombie. Very hard to get my job done. I find I just sit still and zone out.

Placed on 10mg Amlodipine. Noticed a difference when walking, longer stride and faster pace but had periods of being light headed. My BP went down to 137 on a consistent level. Immediately had trouble sleeping more than 5-6 hours per night. Began to feel that something was in my left chest crawling around plus a few sharp pains. Mild headaches a few days after starting Amlodipine. Thought my body would adjust. Headaches turned into the feeling that the top of my head from the eyebrows up was being squeezed. Intense ringing in my ears to the point I could not watch TV or sleep. Gained back three of the five pounds of water I had been able to remove from my legs and feet and my BP climbed to 145 which I figured was due to the water in my legs. If amlodipine was putting water back it, amlodipine was defeating the purpose of lowering my BP. Took myself off of amlodipine and notified doctor.",Does Not Work For Me

My GP started me on diuretics, which made me feel like I was chewing  cotton balls. He switched to Lisinopril. That gave me dizzy spells, often lasting several minutes and striking out of nowhere. I shifted to Losartan, first at 50mg then 100mg. That was a disaster- brain fog, slower reaction time, anger and irritability, inability to concentrate. Now I'm on amlodipine, 10 mg once per day, and am experiencing listlessness, depression, more brain fog, and somnolence. My BP is lower when I'm on these meds. I understand that medical practices get better government ratings and better reimbursements when they keep their patients within certain guidelines, including controlling BP.
