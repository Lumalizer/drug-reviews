1,Captopril,High Blood Pressure,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 14, 2017",7,"The captopril was very effective in controlling my blood pressure,  However, I have very bad alopecia all over.  I looked under side effects For Health Care Professionals and I see alopecia is Common (1% to 10%)!I've now switched over to lisinopril to see if my alopecia (hair loss) will subside.-And captopril has gotten very expensive.",Mikw
2,Captopril,High Blood Pressure,10.0,,"May 13, 2013",18,"I first stumbled upon this medication while living in Mexico. I had a real bad panic attack from metoprolol that was my high blood pressure medication, I was taking at the time, and the doctor there told me to take captopril. I never felt better and I haven't had a panic attack in 3 years, plus my blood pressure is great.  ",Marcos V
3,Captopril,High Blood Pressure,10.0,,"November 9, 2010",24,"I was very happy to find this medicine.  It is inexpensive, works well, has been well researched, and has a noted negative correlation with senile memory loss.  My impression is that I have good mental sharpness, and I have come to trust it after using it for well over 2 years.  (My mother experienced profound memory loss, which she attributed to her blood pressure medicines, so this research was of interest to me).  The downside of this medicine is that it must be taken every 8 hours, so it requires better attention, but it works well, so I am fine with that.  I did experience the dry cough that many new users are said to experience, and this was a minor annoyance for perhaps the first 5 - 6 months, but it was like a tiny tickle in the throat, very minor.",cw2go
4,Captopril,High Blood Pressure,,,"September 17, 2009",11,This drug was marvellous for controlling  my blood pressure when I developed post partum pre eclampsia.  Not so good was the side effects which meant I needed to take anti sickness tablets before each dose.  Worth it though!,jirred
