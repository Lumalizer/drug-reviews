Within one day of taking it, I experienced pain in my back, hips, and legs, along with shortness of breath when trying to go on a walk.  It was awful.  I took it for about 10 days, then stopped.

4,Hydralazine,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 15, 2021",3,"I was on Hydralazine for just less than a month. Started at 10mg and increased to 50mg 3 X per day. The side effects were mild to start so because I had had a mastectomy a month prior I blew the side effects off. Finally with the increase in the dose I couldn’t discount the became extreme shortness of breath, throat swelling, heart rate in the low 100s at rest in recliner, chest pain and feet and ankle swelling. Of course anxiety considering what was happening. Stopped the med and in 24 hours was better. Took about 10 days to get back to baseline. Was put on Irbesartan and no more side effects an BP is under control.",Rdurrance21

Burning in my arms/legs, sore eyeballs, sore ears/neck, small red pinpoint rash on my chest, nausea, phantom itching on one forearm, very dry mouth and bad taste. Started on 10mg 3x/day.

They had not heard of all my side effects. They will get lot # etc from pharmacy. They will issue notices to drs and pharmacies and Health Dept will update warnings.

6,Hydralazine,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 14, 2021",8,"Stated taking hydralazine 9 months ago because catapres was no longer available. Initial problems reported to my doctor. Was told there is a levelling off period and I should ""hang in there"".  I have Parkinson's and if I take the hydralazine to close to my levodopa I get weird feelings in my brain. I researched this and it can cause psychotic characterization in depression. You feel like you are losing it. If you have Parkinson's check with a cardiologist. My neurologist's office says blood pressure meds are tricky when using levodopa because of your brain's ups and downs. Back to hydralazine,I stopped taking it and I feel like a human being. Didn't help lower bp",buddy

I was experiencing angioedema, with weekly swelling of my eyes, lips, back.  Most times it wasn't all at once, but sometimes my back would swell up so bad, it felt like it was going to explode.  Doctor didn't realize what was causing the swelling, until I found something online, that this might be side effect and asked him.",Rodney

I was laying down at night and suddenly had a hemorrhage in my retina of my eye. The doctor said it was from years of high blood pressure. I believe it was from the use of Hydralazine, which dilated my blood vessels and let more blood in and blew out an artery to my retina. I now have a large black shadow in my left eye and distortions on either side. I would not recommend this drug to anyone with high blood pressure.",Rob

His GFR has gone down to Stage 5 kidney failure with this medicine in only under a years times.

Under the NIH SPRINTblood pressure study, I was prescribed a massive dosage of this drug, 300 mg. which I took for years, becoming more and more ill.  I suffered from anorexia and lost over 20 pounds, suffered extreme fatigue, aches and pains, and in the last few months of usage, ran a daily fever of 100-101. It was like having the flu for months.  I had thousands of dollars worth of tests in attempts to diagnose my problem which only made me feel worse.  My daughter and ""Dr Google"" and I finally discovered the cause of my illness:  Hydralazine-induced ANCA, a very serious autoimmune disease which caused vasculitis, inflamed blood vessels causing kidney disease.

And at a very high dose of three 100mg tablets per day, along with Amlodipine and Lisinopril.   About 5 months ago I started experiencing severe joint pain.  It never stayed in one joint for more than a day, but moved around between fingers, wrists, ankles, knees, and shoulders.  At times absolutely excruciating.  At best I had maybe 4 or 5 days (not consecutively) out of that 5-month period where I was in little or no pain.

All from 1 dose.  Thankfully I was in the hospital and they were able to inject me with Benadryl. Yes, it was an allergic reaction but you need to read all of them before taking this med.",Ty

30,Hydralazine,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 28, 2019",87,"Hydrolazine is a fast-acting drug to treat high blood pressure! Avoid this medication at all costs. The side effects I experienced included dizziness, lightheadedness, sweating, vomiting and rapid fluctuations of blood pressure readings. I've been taken to the hospital twice in an ambulance from that med! I recognize that prescription meds affect everyone differently, but please read the list of side effects before allowing your doctor to prescribe Hydralazine. I would rather have a slower acting blood pressure med that gradually decreased blood pressure and kept it down. With all the blood pressure meds out there, there is no reason to use this med.

I am upset with my Cardiologist for not calling. My face is still swollen, severe headache, butterfly rash on face that feels hot, lips swollen and jaw and neck pain.  I think it was Drug-induced lupus erythematosus. This drug should be pulled from market. Too many people have bad reactions. I almost died from it, and am still not out of the woods.

Already on atenolol 50 bid and lisinipril 60 mg a day. Doc put me on this hydralazine 100 mg  - 3 times a day. It did bring my pressure down but the side effects are terrible. I’ve had a migraine everyday with such bad sinus problems I can’t breath. I read that combining lisinipril and hydralazine is habit forming and it’s very hard to come off them safely.

My Blood Pressure doesn’t go down much, and I am having major headaches daily, feels like a sinus headache and my ankles are swollen daily since started taking this medication. I haven’t had headaches for a long time, so I was wondering why all of a sudden I started having debilitating headaches. My doctors assistant always ask me if I am taking my blood pressure medication because each time I go into the doctor office my blood pressure is always high. I don’t have energy as it is and this medication zaps what energy I have and I feel stuck not being able to complete anything, I also wondered why I have a fast heartbeat all of the time. After reading about Hydrazaline and the side affects, sure makes sense that I better get off of this medication.

The worse one was not being able to breathe when taking two tablets at the same time/too close to each other, so for anyone taking this medicine for the first time, don't make that mistake. This medicine has a warning label that states not to drive or operatemachinery while taking this medicine and its a valid warning.This medicine makes you very drowsy.

Worked great in lowering bp.  Side effects have been awful.  25 mg 1 or 2 times a day.  Taking Coreg and Verapamil plus a little diuretic.  Extremely lightheaded, in a fog, confusion.  I was clumsy, stumbling.  Had vision problems.  Actual blind spots.  Flushing, restlessness, bad anxiety.  It did it’s job but I was so freaked out with the way I was feeling.

44,Hydralazine,High Blood Pressure,1.0,,"October 7, 2018",35,"I read the reviews on here before I started taking these medications.  I almost never have reactions from any medications so I thought these people were just whiners or were rare situations.  I was on the hydralazine for about 10 days and I felt like I was going to die every single second that I was on it.  I had severe chest pains, flatulence (gas), rapid heartbeat, headaches, dizziness and I felt like something was squeezing my heart.  I practically begged my doctor to hurry and take me off of this medication and he switched me to Telmisartan.  I feel like my old self again.  The only thing I'm noticing with the Telmisartan is that it makes me sleep like a baby when I do go to bed.  I usually wake up at 7 am on weekends but now I wake up at noon.

54,Hydralazine,High Blood Pressure,,,"October 1, 2017",36,"Talk with your pharmacist after you get the medicines. Tell them the same thing you tell your MD about the symptoms you all are having. Start by taking the information to your MD. If he or she won't listen find an Integrative Medicine Specialist. Primarily YOU and each of us has to be in control of our own health. Start with a check up and if seriously over weight start by trying to loose weight. Weight loss and keeping a normal weight is primary to keep down blood pressure.  Stay active, start with little steps walk, walk. Make  staying active a priority.  Don't give yourself any excuses to be overweight. Obesity sets us all up for diabetes, other serious heart problems and even cancer. Wgt loss has to include activity. Just do it Good luck",hvf

63,Hydralazine,High Blood Pressure,1.0,,"June 27, 2016",40,"I have hypertension. I have been taking a combination of Amlodipine / benazepril. While this has been somewhat effective. my doctor also prescribed 50 mg. of hydralazine twice a day. This medication has shot my pulse up to very high levels three times, most recently from 77 to 105 this morning. While it has reduced my blood pressure slightly, it is not worth the shaking, difficulty urinating, feelings of anxiety, and headache side effects. I almost checked myself into the emergency room two nights ago. I tested withholding the medication and I am sure it is the hydralazine. I checked, and many people, especially men over the age of 60, suffer side effects like this.",EddieHask

Yes, it does lower the blood pressure but the side effects seem to be worse than the cure. Been experiencing muscle cramps, anxiousness, feet felel as if on fire, chest pressure, pain in shoulders, back, paresthesias in legs, arms, etc.  I'm not sure what else it is causing, but, perhaps the cure is worse than the disease.  Why is it that every medication tends to be worse than the actually problem.",papccs

Spent 3 days in there, & 50mg twice a day of Hydralazine was one of the meds they put me on. Taking these with a meal, & glass of milk to try to ease the side effects barely helps. I get really drowsy with body aches where I want to take a nap, but can't sleep, & find myself sitting staring at the floor a lot, unable to concentrate, really short of breath to the point where just walking 50 feet becomes laboring. On a positive note my diastolic reading has dropped over 50 points. As for the back pain, I found out a previous blood pressure medicine had drained my body of Potassium, Once my levels were normal the pain went away.",firebird1
