0,Carvedilol,High Blood Pressure,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 22, 2022",0,"I just want to comment about the reviews.  My wife had a heart attack three months ago.  One of her medications was carvedilol, 6.25mg x2 daily.  She was also on Lisinopril 5mg plus other heart related meds.  It seems that everyone has a different experience with any of the BP, heart meds.  It doesn't sound like the docs ever sit sit down with the patient and explain what to expect with taking of meds, especially two or more to treat the same condition.  My wife is now on four different meds for BP.  Her initial BP after two weeks out of hospital was in the 100-115/75-85 range. First visit, increased Carvedilol to 12.5mg 2x daily, next visit increase lisinopril to 20 mg/day, next visit prescribed spironolactone, last visit Jardiance.  She feels like rubbish now.  BP down but at what cost.  I just don't get it.   I am keen to  include a pharmacist into the visit and prescribing 10 days of pills, not 30 days and then they should do a review.",Trmptdan

I had big side effects. PCD said I wasn't complying with dosage. Finally had extreme episode with my kidneys and weaned myself off of this drug. New outside doctor put me on carvedilol which has minor side affects but had my blood pressure where it should be on small dosage.I  got my 1st prescription at Walgreens and after 2 weeks, my BP was great. After that prescription ran out, I renewed it with VA. Results are my BP is 15mmhg higher now. I noticed manufacturer is a different one. I've read a lot of comments like this from people. Not all manufacturers are the same and doctors should listen to patients. Each of us are different and need different care. One drug does not fit all people. Doctors, stop listening to drug reps and be more concerned with your patients. They're the ones who pay your bills and need your help.",72 year old mal

I agree with others, doctor denies it is cause weight gain, bloated, horrible pain in knees, problem with gums, blurry vision, generally feeling horrible, no way to exert, feel just wasted.

One month ago I started having lightheadedness and it was getting worse by the day it seems. I started out a dose of 6.25mg twice a day. Blood pressure still rising into the scary high numbers. My putzs of a doctor for 18 years said to double the medication. 18 years and you would think that your doctor would know your usual symptoms or even his patient right? Wrong!  Not mine it seems,  because after reading these reviews here it seems that the anxiety through the roof symptoms could of been avoided? The side effects of this drug are not worth it. Please when I tell you this believe me and others here. (unlike my own doctor) I would go cold turkey but you cannot do that with dangerously high bp #’s .

I understood it to be a temporary therapeutic drug needed to help recover from the surgery trauma to my heart. My surgeon said my heart was otherwise OK.  When I got out of the hospital, I experienced major side effects including shaking, anxiety, panic attacks, dizziness, and mental confusion.  I told my Cardiologist about the side effects but he said I should continue the carvedilol but cut back the dosage slightly which did not help. I also told my cardiologist my blood pressure was erratic  After 4 months I told my cardiologist I would not take carvedilol anymore. He prescribed cardizem along with carvedilol.  I took only the cardizem and all side effect went away except panic attacks but, blood pressure stayed high.

The first side effect may be coming from something else and is under review. The middle one may also be coming from something else too but I see ""trachial restriction"" as one of the side effects. The sneezing is 4-6 x per day.  Years back I was on another drug that caused all kinds of problems and my kidneys were discovered to have been damaged.

Tried lexapro before with the coreg but the third night I felt hot and felt weird heartbeat so I stopped. Told the new doctor what happened before with lexapro, but he said it wasn't the lexapro but the coreg. Start the metoprolol tomorrow and lexapro a couple days later, so hopefully this works.
