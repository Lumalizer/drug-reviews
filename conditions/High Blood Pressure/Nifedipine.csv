I called paramedic because my resting HR got to 120-130BPM triggered anxiety, felt chest was fluttering and flushed feeling and funny sensation as if my heart would give out or pass out. Upon checking my BP: 180/120!!! How can a medication trigger anxiety type effects and not control BP. This was all provoked by the medication, it was only at the 11-12h mark did I start to feel better My usual BPM is 65-75 I will not continue this medication. An effect like that is very harmful for myself, cannot imagine what it could do to the child if I had conceived on this med!",Scary stuff

3,Nifedipine,High Blood Pressure,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 7, 2022",1,"I wanted to write a good review on this medicine because there’s so many negatives. To anyone reading these reviews scared to try this medicine, don’t be! I have had chronic hypertension my whole life as I only have 1 kidney. I’m 23 with very resistant hypertension.  Without medicine I range 180-220/105-130. I started off at 30 mg ER then upped to 60 mg ER. I'm now at about 135-140 /85-90, which for me is a miracle! Drugs like labetalol, verapamil, lisinopril, losartan, amplodipine do nothing to lower my bp. My side effects are constipation but I counteract that with a probiotic! I also experience tingly arms and hands occasionally but really doesn’t bother me and goes away. This medicine is worth a try.",Anonymous

9,Nifedipine,High Blood Pressure,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 25, 2021",2,"I am a mom who is pregnant with second child. I have had chronic high bp my whole life due to renal stenosis. I’ve been on lisinopril since I was 10 years old but unfortunately I can't take that while pregnant. Off of meds I run about 190/110. Every bp med that is safe for pregnancy does NOTHING for me. Labetalol, methyldopa, verapamil does not even lower it in the slightest. Nifedipine lowers mine to around 135/85. I hate the side effects and my heart rate is through the roof on this med but I am grateful it works and allows me to bring children into this world safely.  Without this medication I would not be able to have children. The second I give birth I will immediately stop taking this and switch back to my normal med.

Made me more stuffy, fatigued & tired after only mild exertion, bloating & constipation. The worst of it was the tachycardia I was experiencing. It was coming on anywhere from 30 mins to 4 hours after taking it. I have been diagnosed with Supraventricular Tachycardia a long time ago & it never bothered me until recently. It must be something new they are putting in the Nifedipine ER. IF YOU HAVE TACHYCARDIA, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION. IT WILL MAKE YOUR TACHYCARDIA WORSE.

It took months for them to wear off. I never felt better. One day 2 years after stopping my BP is 180+/110+. Primary care said too high, and we began trying BP meds again. With out allergy medicine, my side effect symptoms were immediate, nausea, headaches and dizziness. Sick all day. I stopped all BP meds again and felt great again. Then we tried nifedipine XR. Within 1 hour I had insomnia followed by an extreme debilitating headache, nausea, dizziness and my BP soared. I have never been this sick. The effects have lasted now for 5 days.

Specifically dizziness, headache, extreme fatigue, edema in my ankles and feet, muscle weakness, flushing, etc. I have even had some  hallucinations,  not sure I can attribute that to the medication though. A couple of months ago the dosage was increased from 30mg to 60mg because there was a stretch where it wasn't seemingly working as well. Well the 60 mg was working okay at first, then we started working from home and it kept dropping my blood pressure to dangerous levels, to the point of passing out. I went back to 30 mg and my blood pressure is close to where it needs to be some of the time but it seems to be the best I can get on this medication. Close, but no cigar, as they say.
