0,Lopressor,High Blood Pressure,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 5, 2021",13,"I was placed on Lopressor in the early 80's and was on it for about 3 years.  After roughly 2 years I started to tire easily, lost interest in things in general, my personality and outlook changed to to being very negative and I was diagnosed with clinical depression.  Counselling and medications didn't not help at all and it wasn't until my wife saw an article in a medical journal the stated that some patients who had been on Lopressor for 2 -3 years became clinically depressed.  We showed the article to my Physician and he changed me to another prescription.  It took about 4 weeks for me to get back to normal.  I am now on amplodine/benazapril whic is working very well for me.",jarhead
1,Lopressor,High Blood Pressure,,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 30, 2017",25,"I'v'e been taking Lopressor, 100mg, 1 tab twice daily for more years than I can remember... probably 20 or so, for hypertension. It seems, together with 2 other meds, i.e. dyazide and Altace, aka Ramipril, an ACE Inhibitor. they usually give me good BP readings. Recently, and I think it was more to do with dehydration... I had 2 SVT attacks within 60 or so days of each other.... and, again, if anything the lopressor probably did its best to prevent them... but it can't do everything. In short, this drug has been around a long time, and is a time-tested Beta Blocker.",NathanielA
2,Lopressor,High Blood Pressure,10.0,,"June 24, 2014",61,"I took Lopressor for 24 years it worked very well in lowering my blood pressure and even calming my anxiety but lately it doesn't work on me very well as before, I guess the doctor will change it.",Good experience
3,Lopressor,High Blood Pressure,10.0,,"August 28, 2013",81,Take pill every 12 hours. Works fine for me. Requested a beta-blocker because of the anti stage-fright effects. No more 'adrenaline dumps' in stressful situations. Helps me tremendously in my work and social interactions.,rbh
4,Lopressor,High Blood Pressure,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 12, 2012",89,"This medicine has done an excellent job with lowering my blood pressure. However, I have been having dry eyes and gas. On the positive side, this medicine is also good for anxiety!",Anonymous
5,Lopressor,High Blood Pressure,5.0,,"July 29, 2010",93,Took metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide for several years.  Seemed to reduce blood pressure to acceptable levels.  About a year ago I experienced shortness of breath at times along with some fluid in lungs.  Turns out that metoprolol (Lopressor) can cause that.  Got off the metoprolol and lungs cleared up.  Not taking it anymore.,AceMan
6,Lopressor,High Blood Pressure,2.0,,"June 16, 2010",50,"I am a 30 year old female and I have high blood pressure (and tachycardia). Approximately 20 minutes or so after I would take my dose of Lopressor, I would get symptoms similar to a panic attack. Extreme hot flash and rapid heartbeat (more rapid than my usual... my pulse rate is usually around 100-105 as it is.) When I told my doctor, he told me to quit taking the Lopressor and then he put me on another high blood pressure medicine. I only took Lopressor for a few days, because of the side effects, so I cannot comment on it's effectiveness in blood pressure reduction.",LullabyNine

9,Lopressor,High Blood Pressure,4.0,,"July 15, 2009",40,It is fourth blood pressure pill for me. It feels like it is only partly working. My blood pressure problems are usually happening after anxiety attacks of which doctors says I have but don't know why.,Anonymous
