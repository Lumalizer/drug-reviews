0,Clonidine,High Blood Pressure,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 13, 2022",1,"I am a retired physician. When I was an ER doctor I used Clonidine extensively on patients withsevere high blood pressure, with good results. (This was short term). I developed hypertension myself about 15 years ago. However, it became much more severe over time. I have been given about 6 different blood pressure agents but recently none controlled me. Clonidine 0.1 mg was initially helpful. I was finally hospitalized with a BP of 220/120.  I was seen by a total of 6 doctors over three hospitalizations. Nothing they gave me worked.  I went back to Clonidine 0.2 mg every 2 hours. (Sometimes with Doxazosin 2 mg or Amlodipine 10 mg. These do not help very much). The most severe elevations usually occur between 5:30 AM and 11:00 AM. This is called the ""morning surge"" . ( Causes ?). During the surge I take Clonidine more frequently. However,  I have found is that if you take Clonidine 0.2 mg with Ambien 10 mg at bedtime this  will drop your systolic BP to about 120 mmHg for 7 hours.",Nesdiodoc

Worked great for years until my pharmacy switched primary manufacturers from Unichem to Trupharma, which only worked a few hours, and not well. Had tried other generics did not have an issue. Until now. Pharmacy did not have Unichem, gave me Trupharma, got a replacement, Actavis, which is worse. Pressure behind eyes is severe, BP is in the 150s/90s (I take other BP meds too). All generics are NOT created equal.",Lmj

4,Clonidine,High Blood Pressure,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 28, 2021",1,I have dangerously high blood pressure and Dysautonomia and mild anxiety and I've been on this medication for six months now. Sadly it's not done anything for my blood pressure or helped really with my Dysautonomia / autonomic symptoms however I'm on on 100 micrograms a day which is 0.1 mg a day.I've not had any side effects accept dry mouths and sleep issues. I'm hugely sensitive to medications so I'm not sure if we can up the dose soon or not.But for people that don't know this it does come in smaller doses now and I take 25 micrograms tablets which four of those are equal to 0.1 mg.,Tabbitha

Then I realized pharmacy refilled ACTAVIS (peach color, round pills). I took it at 11pm. It is now 5:52AM as I write this. I have not slept. Check your meds before you leave pharmacy. Or do what I did, have your pharmacy note your account that you only want UNICHEM. My rating for Unichem is 10. Rating for Actavis is 10 if used for ADHD but 1 if used for sleep.",yazmin

10,Clonidine,High Blood Pressure,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 29, 2020",79,"I started taking clonidine for high blood pressure approximately 4 years ago and it never reacted with me in any negative way until recently a few months ago did they change the medicine and I've always taken a generic but with the orange (or more pink pills) I was getting sick not feeling well, tired, weak and really feeling horrible I didn't know what it was.  Then when I changed my pharmacy  I went back to the white oval ones I had before  (I don't know the company's name) I'm feeling good again.

I have had uncontrolled high blood pressure for 5 years secondary to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) . The doctor I was under the care of wasn’t inclined to treat my PH because I am a woman.

I tried this and it helped at first and if you only took it once at bedtime it might be ok but I took it 2X like they said and fell asleep in meetings and at my desk, I could not function and took the first one right away since it was really high and could barely drive back to work and then had to rest my head. It was awful, I have a job calling on customers and was not functional at all. Praying for a better option.",Velma

14,Clonidine,High Blood Pressure,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 10, 2020",36,"I have been taking clonidine for about 8 year's straight. I was given the drug for extreme hypertension! I've never had any of the above mentioned side effect unless I took extra. Which over the course of the year's I have had to do because of a high tolerance to the drug. But I have had a rapid decline in tooth  health with decay/loss which I'm sure can be attributed to the dry mouth I experience! I have started using to biotene and hard candies to combat this issue. Clonidine has never made me feel groggy, I never have ""nightmares"" I've only gotten dizzy/faint when having over taken the drug. What it does is drops your blood pressure- hence the fact it's prescribed also for high blood pressure",Rae
15,Clonidine,High Blood Pressure,2.0,,"February 3, 2020",67,"Clonidine was my third group of blood pressure meds due to side effects from others.  Started out with 0.1mg at night. 6 months ago I starting 196/101 so I ended up at 0.3mg morning and night.  Yes, it lowers blood pressure.  I couldn't function as a human being but it lowers blood pressure.  I am in the construction industry so this was not going to cut it.  I was tired, noxious, couldn't think straight, remember anything, balance was way off.  The list goes on.  I don't drink alcohol but I would relate it drinking mescal tequila all day long.  It was by far, the worst med I have ever taken.  I am now off of it.  I never realized how bad it was until I got off clonidine.  My life was put on hold for 3 months while on the higher dose.  I am now trying to catch up.  I know all meds effect different people differently but IMO this is one to stay way from.  Watch for side effects. Giving this a 2 rating.  It works for BP, but the side effects blow this one out of the park",D
16,Clonidine,High Blood Pressure,7.0,,"January 17, 2020",135,"I have used clonidine for 1+years. It's my last resort med.  I've had HBP for 40 years and have tried most other HBP meds with bad results/side effects. Clonidine at first made me very tired and my eyes sensitive to light. These both wore off after a few weeks and the only side effects that remain are dry mouth & eyes and sometimes heel pain. But these are tolerable to me compared to ER trips for 230/130 blood pressure. I take it 3 times a day exactly every 8 hours. Over 8 hours, I get withdrawal symptoms.   Then my pharmacy changed me from Unichem  brand of clonidine to another brand. My blood pressure went through the roof! I couldn't figure out why my blood pressure was spiking & my face was beet red. Then I realized that it only happened since they changed brands. So I found an original Unichem clonidine pill and took it and low and behold normal blood pressure and no red face! These companies need to be held accountable for substandard pills!",Blingy Lady
17,Clonidine,High Blood Pressure,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 13, 2020",30,"I went into the emergency room for a pulled side muscle and a blood pressure of 215/120. I was given clonidine while I was there in the waiting room. An hour later I was nauseous and so dizzy. Ended up in the restroom throwing up with diarrhea and so weak and dizzy I couldn't stand or walk straight. Long story short, I had to get a change of clothes and stayed in the restroom for an hour before I could come out. It lowered my blood pressure to 120/60 but I don't ever want this medicine again",Stefany

The Dr. put me on clonidine and my BP finally went to normal levels.  Unfortunately, the med only lasts for about five or six hours, and my BP goes back up to around 150/90. So far, the only side effect is the dry mouth.  I can't say that this is the solution, but it is the first time in about four years that I have had a handle on my BP.",Rod
19,Clonidine,High Blood Pressure,7.0,,"December 18, 2019",39,"I have been on clonidine 0.1 two times a day for three years. I do cut the 0.1 tablets and a half so I take 0.5 four times a day. I have to say there are side effects with this medicine but it works fantastic for my high blood pressure which is a problem for my lung disease I don't have regular high blood pressure, I have a lung disease that causes my blood pressure to go high. Without this drug I know I would be dead. The only thing I could say is be careful on which manufacturer you get. I use unichem manufacturer which seems to be really good on my blood pressure. So don't switch manufacturers because they all act and feel differently in your system. The side effects that I get during the three years is thinning of the top of my head of hair and some days I'm very tired and I sleep and sometimes I have some aches and pains. I'm very grateful for clonidine",Wayne
20,Clonidine,High Blood Pressure,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 17, 2019",50,"I have been taking the drug clonidine for my blood pressure for going on three months now. It does mostly keep my blood pressure normal. I did have one spike one night. But if I sit up for a few minutes my blood pressure goes back to normal. I decided to look at people’s reviews because I am having some side effects and am concerned. My side effects are upper pain across my back, sometimes just behind my heart in my back. Also anxiousness before my next dose is due. Also some humming sound in my ears, or my heartbeat in my ears. Other minor things but mostly these are the major concerns. Any advice from anyone?",Tambo

I've been on it for about 10 days -- I can barely stay awake during the day, I'm constipated, and it doesn't even lower my blood pressure (I'm taking .1mg, twice a day).  I'm stopping it as of today and going back to amlodipine, which kept my blood pressure under control.  This is a horrible drug.",Sybil
23,Clonidine,High Blood Pressure,10.0,,"October 20, 2019",21,"I've used clonidine before for high blood pressure. I don't think I had hot flashes at the time but I wanted to give my two cents worth regarding a couple things. It absolutely will make you sleepy for a couple weeks then it wears off. The sleepy part that is. Also you get dry mouth. The sleepy part is great at night for those of us with insomnia but during the day it's not feasible. Lastly I need to comment about how much people are saying they're taking. NO WAY it's 25 mg probably 0.25 mg! I overdosed on this medication when I was much much younger. It would be very dangerous for someone to take a dose like that! Please don't play with these pills. If your doctor says one pill, take one pill. I may try them again for hot flashes as HRT made my migraines worse.",kalasmom3

29,Clonidine,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 4, 2019",93,My pharmacy always gave me Clonidine  from the company Unichem.  For some reason they changed to another company. When I took first dose instead of bringing down  the BP like Unichem pill for clonidine did always instead it elevated. I never see under 170/99. This pill is not working as needed for what Unichem gave me in the same dose of 0.2. I hunted and came across an old Unicem bp pill and took it and my bp came down like it should had done. So the next time  I am due for a pill I take the new brand  and again it elevated. I am filing with the state medical board to investigate. This company is not making the pill at mg it is suppose to be. They have  the dose incorrect is what the urgent care doctor stated and he has referred me to my family doctor to file report and get another medicine not with this company.,Danza
30,Clonidine,High Blood Pressure,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 14, 2019",41,Prescribed 0.1mg for hypertension at my annual physical. Being unaware of this condition I did not know that I actually had white coat syndrome and that BP was not nearly as bad as office reading. This drug causes dry mouth and fatigue in addition to orthostatic hypotension which makes you lightheaded upon standing. Check your BP at home. It might be lower than you think. Overall not a good experience. Change your diet and exercise. BP will normalize and you won’t have to deal with side effects.,Anonymous
31,Clonidine,High Blood Pressure,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 29, 2018",69,"Clonidine will lower your blood pressure when nothing else works, but once you've been on it a few years (I've been on .3mg twice a day for almost 12 since I was 27) you will be stuck with it. If I miss a dose my BP can easily rise to 240/130 so use it only as a last resort after trying other meds. I have had a blood pressure problem since my early 20s and tried many other meds first, 2 of which I'm still on in conjunction with clonidine. The main side effects are dry mouth and sedation also postural hypotension (feeling faint when you stand up) these effects will mostly go away after a few weeks. It's extremely powerful so try all the others first, like I said it does the job but the rebound hypertensive effect of missing a dose will make you feel like garbage and is deadly.",Ron
