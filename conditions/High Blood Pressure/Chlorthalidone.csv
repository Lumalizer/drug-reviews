0,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 19, 2022",0,"I started Chlorthalidone for newly diagnosed HBP and it worked immediately.  At first no side effects AT ALL.  THEN I realized I always had muscle aches and I found myself sleeping more and more.  I'd go to sleep at night take my son to school and come back home to sleep another 5 hours.  I now always have chest pressure AND THE WORST.  I had 4 cavities within months of starting it. My dentist was shocked.  I was in my 40s and had NEVER had a single cavity. He immediately expressed his concern, asked about what I'm doing that might cause dry mouth and told me to talk to my Dr about my new medication but  when I mentioned it as a side note on my visit he didn't think anything of it. NOW my gums have receded to nearly NOTHING. This can't be reversed! I'm so afraid I'm losing ALL OF MY TEETH and have only been on this a year!!!",Lilmiss

Didn’t help with bp at all,  but my kidneys now will not work without this stuff I literally gain a pound and hour of I stop taking it!  Worst decision ever! Side effects are the ones making my life dependent on a drug that I didn’t need in the first place!",Pissedoff
2,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 4, 2021",1,"I was prescribed 25mg to add to another B/P Med I was taking, as my B/P  was always over 136 - 155 systolic.  I myself reduced it to 1/2 tab after 6 weeks as so lightheaded + up to toilet 3 -4 times a night!  Have just stopped it today after 8.5 weeks as even though I'm fit, (73 years) I'm finding I now cannot get up steep hills without constantly stopping.  I'm in training to do a 2 day tramp/hike in a week and got so scared yesterday when at my very large local library and walking up four flights of stairs, I had to stop halfway up second staircase - got the lift!  so my B/P now always 114/74 to 126/86 and I drink lots of water, don't drink alcohol.  Just not worth the weak feeling in my legs and the fainting feeling throughout my body.",sanann

4,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,1,,"May 6, 2021",26,"I was on this for Blood pressure and Fluid Retention. This medication has been difficult to take! I am highly allergic to sulfa, and I don't understand why I have taken this horrible drug for this period of time.  I have experienced several side effects which I have struggled with daily. I have had major problems with hives, rashes, gum bleeding, indigestion, heart flutters, hair loss and thinning, lack of energy, tingling in hand and fingers, dark spots on the skins, depression, stomach sickness, dry mouth and eyes, dry and peeling skin, and heaviness in legs and thighs.  There are other side effects that included sharp pains all over my body. I am now seeing a dermatologist and taking additional drugs to tolerate the indigestion. Generic drugs are not for everyone.  This is definitely a form of abuse and no one should be force to go through this process! There has to be a better way to do this!",Sad Sue
5,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 28, 2021",19,"My cardiologist prescribed this because I was having blood pressure spikes mostly caused by stress.  I only take half of a pill (12.5 mg) at night along with atenolol.  It completely stabilized my BP and I only go to the restroom once during the night.  At first, it caused my heart to pound with an increase in pulse rate. Also a little dizziness.  After 2-3 weeks of this, those symptoms stopped and now I don’t have any problems.  Works great for me.",Michele
6,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 19, 2021",21,"The medicine did exactly what it was supposed to do.  My blood pressure was lowered but not without very bad migraines, dizziness and constipation  I've been taking this for a little over a month in hopes that my headaches would disappear or at least not be so severe.  Well they are still just as painful as the first day I experienced the headaches and dizziness.  In the trash they are going because the side effects aren't worth it.  I'm so over it!",SoOverIt
7,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 7, 2020",17,"I have been using Chlorthalidone 20mg for over 7 years now, since my early fifties, and I could not be happier. My blood pressure level lowered from the start, never had any side effects. I am completely satisfied with the medication.",Sunny
8,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 19, 2020",35,"Although it did lower blood pressure, the side effects were horrible for me, so I had to stop it immediately. I started getting a loss of balance feeling, very weird to describe. Open spaces (for example a space open parking lot) would make me feel like I was going to fall. I always need to hold on to a cart or anything while standing. At first I thought it was just me, or a mental thing, but later realized it was this damn pill!! When I would walk it felt so weird, felt light headed, a bit of confusion too. I stopped taking it and felt better within 2 days. Now I have to get on a new pill and hope it doesn’t have no yucky side effects!!",Brenda
9,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2020",50,Chlorthalidone helped me with my blood pressure to go down but the side effects were just too much. I felt high and drunk on this medicine and I had only taken it for 3 days. The feeling would come in waves. I was prescribed 25mg's once daily. My vision was very blurry and I became very confused and disoriented. It became difficult to walk. My legs cramped. I had heart flutters and irregular heartbeat for a few minutes. I had horrible anxiety and panic attacks on this med. I also had sharp pains in my toenails and my fingernails. My voice became hoarse and my eyes became bloodshot red with lots of pressure in my eyes. The room was spinning and I kept getting dizzy spells when I walked. I could not function on this. I could not concentrate or complete my daily tasks. I slept most of the day because of it. I stopped taking it and I feel better more and more every day. It was extremely scary to be on! I will never take this medicine again! It is definitely not for me!,TT

12,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 11, 2020",13,This drug is amazing.  Using it for about 8 years and 25mg is all  I need to keep my pressure under control. The best part is it's inexpensive and has virtually no side effects (potassium is an issue as with all diuretics and sometimes I get a rash).  I tried  hydrochlorothiazide and it was useless.   This is the only one for me.,EDS
13,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 24, 2020",59,"Let me start off by saying this medication is HORRIBLE!!!  Let me share my story...I’m a 27 year old female . Diagnosed with hypertension. I’ve been on metoprolol for a few months but since my blood pressure continued to raise my doctor suggested trying  chlorthalidone  25 mg To add to the mix .Within 2 days of taking this pill I was in the ER. First symptom I noticed was my heart racing extremely fast (145bpm) and my blood pressure spiked to about 179/110 I got really worried . I had never seen my BP that high . Usually 145/95 is my usual.My muscles were weak in my legs and I was feeling very fatigued.  Turns out the hospital said I had low potassium and dehydration. The 2 symptoms this medication is known for . I even drank my normal 100 oz of water daily Both days while taking this medication .   And still was dehydrated. The hospital told me this medication is rarely given anymore for this reason. Please if your prescribed this, be careful!!",Nicole

15,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 29, 2019",26,"I have been taking 25mg of Chlorthalidone for at least 15 years now after having too many side effects from other blood pressure meds. I was first prescribed 50mg of Chlorthalidone from a cardiologist who I went to on my own, after refusing to be given a third med to counteract side effects from the first two BP meds my PCP gave me. I found that when I walked or did yard work 50mg lowered my BP too much. So I asked for the lower dose. I am a 76 yr old that is active. Also I make sure I keep plenty of potassium in my diet. I only take two meds, this one for BP and another one for high cholesterol. I am very happy with Chlorthalidone. I always ask for the lowest dose possible when taking a new med. I've had bad experiences when they just try larger doses but not with Chlorthalidone.",Donna
16,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 22, 2019",14,"It worked well at decreasing my systolic BP but, gave me horrible migraines. I also had pins and needles in my feet and some days I felt really weak and out of it like I had an electrolyte problem.",Jt
17,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 2, 2019",34,I have been taking Chlortalidone for almost 2 years. It has done wonders for me and my cardiologist put me on this since Lasix was not working. Like many people on here I did have pain in my feet and joints. That's only because it is a diuretic and it gets rid of more than just salt. You have to take a multi vitamin and constantly load your system. I also skip a day between dosages so I don't lose too much minerals. Otherwise I love the medicine.,Aarika
18,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 14, 2019",46,"After being on chlorthalidone the following has happened. Yes, it lowered my BP, then after 3 months out of now where I couldn't walk, had knee pain, went to the ER and I left on crutches with Ibuprofen.  After 3 more months I had pain in my ankle- sharp pain, like pins and needles jabbing me constantly.  At nights my hips are hurting even burning sensations.  Now I have finally figured it out, it is the side effects of  chlorthalidone.",MOMAFE

Have nausea, headache, rash, peeling skin, pins and needles, swollen ankles, hoarse throat, and more. I am trying to find something without side effects but doc doesn’t care.It is better than lisinopril which is Brazilian viper snake venom or losartan that harms muscles so bad you can’t go up steps. And losartan has been recalled.",Me
20,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,1,,"October 1, 2019",59,"Chlorthalidone is a great medicine. Depending on the generic manufacturer, this medicine could be very good or very bad. I had used Chlorthalidone manufactured by Rising Pharma and it is excellent. On the other hand, I have used chlorthalidone manufactured by Nivagen Pharma and this is useless and I think, it is fake. If the medicine is supposed to control the blood pressure and it is found that it failed to function, patients should be allowed to sue the manufacturer. Generics made by the US registered in overseas companies are the main culprits and it is time the public put their eyes on them. Again, Drugs.com is protecting these bad companies by the type of questioning. The ratings should mention the manufacturer's name such as Nivagen Chlorthalidone, Mylan Chlorthalidone, Rising Pharma chlorthalidone. The one star rating I gave is for Drugs.com itself because it has posed the questions wrongly. Let Drugs.com contact me if it questions my points of view",Johnny
21,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 29, 2019",34,"I would give zero stars if I could. I am severely allergic to sulfa medications of which Hygroton is related to. The doctor and the pharmacist told me that because of it's chemical structure only a very very tiny portion of people have an allergic reaction to Hygroton. Well, I  am one of them. After only 3 doses, my throat started tightening and feeling itchy, my voice was hoarse , sneezing and watery eyes and I was overwhelmed with a feeling of impending doom. Went to ER where they started IV and gave me a ton of meds and I am now on high dose prednisone for a week. So, be very cautious if you are allergic to sulfa and are given this drug. Trust your instincts if you start having symptoms and go to the ER. 3 days later, still waiting for a call back from the doctors office.",Ana
22,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,6,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 26, 2019",29,"I opted for this drug when other BP drugs nearly caused me to have a nervous breakdown from the side effects. I went to the emergency room with shortness of breath, heart rhythm problem, extremely high blood pressure 208/120, so sick I couldn't stand up.The doctors have me psychotic medicine and sent me home. At home I almost lost my mind and sent back to the emergency room, this time they  gave me benadryl and I stopped taking all the prescribed meds and I started feeling better. Sent to my primary dr. he recommended this drug and it has been working until the pharmacy tells me they can no longer get it for me. So I will be going without meds because the pharmacist says he can't get any more from this manufacturer.",Problem child
23,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 11, 2019",34,Never taking this medication chlorthalidone  again. After 3 days rapidly increased my heart rate and gave me horrible palpitations. Sent me to the hospital & now I have to recover and try not to exert myself at all or else I'm faced with my heart rate shooting up to 170. It helped my blood pressure a bit but anything that makes my heart go through such strain isn't worth it.,Thisgirl
24,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,3,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 6, 2019",38,After taking Chorthalidone for a couple of years I ran out and has to get a new prescription.  With none to take I discovered that the muscle pain that I had been fighting went away.  I keep track of my blood pressure and they are same with and without. So no more Chlorthalidone.  If you are fighting  muscle pain you may want to try this.,Grumpy
25,Chlorthalidone,High Blood Pressure,2,,"February 19, 2019",49,"I did not have any noticeable side effects on the drug (except more frequent urination), but it did nothing to improve my high blood pressure, which hovered around 138/85 both before & while on the med. Dr doubled my dose. Still no impact. So when script ran out, I opted not to pay for more, and my dr was fine with it.Well, I experienced MAJOR water retention when I went off. Like gaining 12 lbs in about 2 days. I normally weigh 135 lbs and have never had a problem with water retention before. My calves and ankles doubled in size and felt uncomfortably tight. My face and stomach looked bloated. So my doctor advised I go back on and slowly wean off of it. Sure enough, lost the lbs when I went back on, but always came back once I gradually stopped taking altogether So now I have to remain on a diuretic for a condition I never had before I started then stopped this drug. And my blood pressure is still high, so Dr wants to add Lisinopril, but the side effects I've read about that terrify me!",Medical Mystery

I have settled on 2 with positive side-effects that work okay (captopril and amlodipine), and chlorthalidone with no side-effects that I am aware of and which pounds the numbers down the most.
