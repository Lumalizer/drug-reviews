0,Vasotec,High Blood Pressure,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 13, 2019",12,"Just terrible for me:  I was on Vasotec years ago, and it completely scrambled my memory.  The simplest tasks became a nightmare--I remember trying to buy a birthday card, and I simply could not understand the text.  I had to re-read it over, and over again it was that bad.  I simply could not comprehend what the card meant at the time.   I then told my doctor later that the pills were having such strange side effects, and he then switched me to a different medication.",MikeM
