0,Labetalol,High Blood Pressure,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 10, 2022",1,"I have resistant high blood pressure. I’ve been on at least 10 drugs. What a rollercoaster.  I started out with my BP over 300/80. Nothing has worked. Side effects were horrible. The the only drug that has worked is labetolol had to take 800 mg a day to get it to work. After 4 months, I am unable to do anything. Weakness in my extremities. I feel like I’m sinking when I try to walk.  I can't get up from the toilet. Doc has tried yet another one. It didn’t work (no big surprise) the newest one I will be trying is Bystolic. Wish. Me luck!",Lynda

On my third day taking it I feel anxiety, sleeplessness/insomnia, and just not like my usual self.  Not sure if I should stop taking it or let doctor know I have follow up in a week.

2,Labetalol,High Blood Pressure,1.0,,"November 5, 2021",1,I also had a tingly head from this medicine and I only took it for 2 days before I stopped. You aren’t crazy listen to your body. The tingly scalp was enough to make me stop it,Anonymous
3,Labetalol,High Blood Pressure,3.0,,"July 18, 2021",9,"Since taking Labetalol (Oct 2018) I lose hair, I get so hot I nearly faint, I walk like I’m intoxicated. I have never drank alcohol. My scalp tingles and I have blurred vision. I am tired and sleep too much. If I walk a short distance my heart races. I have strange dreams. I need a test to find out what I am allergic to and my ENT can’t risk it as long as I am on this drug. He said the test medicine and Labetalol could cause swelling in my throat which could kill me. I like the way it takes care of my B/P but I sure don’t appreciate the reactions from the drug. God bless y’all .",Suz e Q
4,Labetalol,High Blood Pressure,7.0,,"May 6, 2021",3,"Take 100 mg three times daily for high BP.  Very tired, lightheaded at times, and weak.  Like somebody else said, not sure if it’s from the Labetalol, or the 60mg if Prednisone I’m on.  Sure would love to know the answer!  Also, developed a tremor!!!",Georgie
5,Labetalol,High Blood Pressure,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 4, 2021",4,"I have been experiencing high BP since the end of my pregnancy and now during the postpartum period. I’m on 100 mg twice a day and it has helped manage my BP. I think I may need a higher dose or to add on another med because it’s around 142/86 on the medicine. I experience tingling on my scalp, a little bit of heaviness sometimes when I take a very deep breath, and I’m a little more tired than usual. Otherwise it’s been fine and a much better experience than when my dr tried switching me to HCTZ. I ended up back on labetalol.",33 YO Nursing Mom

8,Labetalol,High Blood Pressure,1.0,,"July 21, 2020",26,"On this medication  labetalol for about 15 months for high blood pressure. It was a horrible experience. I developed POTS due to taking labetalol. Upon standing it would elevate my heart to 170 and resting my pulse would be 55. Doc said it couldn't be from labetalol and assured me numerous times labetalol is super safe. Other side effects were I also felt like I could never breath, I was always dizzy,  extremely hot, it would drop my bp so slow upon standing and my heart would race to the point of me feeling like I was going to faint. I became bed ridden for months and EXTREMELY depressed. Thankfully, I ran out of my labetalol prescription and had three days waiting for refill because I called in late. Three days of not taking it and I felt amazing. No racing heart. No low blood pressure. No dizziness. I felt so normal I cried. I could breath again. Listen to your body. Doctors don't always know everything. 15 months of my life I will never get back. It was poison to my body. I'm on 5mg lisonopril now and feel great.",Anonymous
9,Labetalol,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 16, 2020",11,"I was put on labetalol 100 mg twice a day in Oct 2019 for high blood pressure.  The same week I saw my opthamologist and he said my  vision had not changed in a year, AMD.  I immediately had low BP and had difficulty standing, walking. Was very weak. Adjusted the dose down taking 1/4 of a tab and sometimes 1/2 tab taking only 50 -75 mg a day and could not adjust the the med. I stopped taking it six weeks later.  I have never returned to normal BP.  I now have labile low bp and losing memory, hearing, and have severe damage from AMD including wet in one eye requiring injections every month.  Drs can find nothing to help me. I have not taken any since Dec 1 and this is May 16.  I am getting weaker and weaker.  My bp is sometimes in73 systolic.  Apparently I will die with dementia, blind and deaf.   No one should ever take this medication.  This medication is dangerous and no one should take the chance for death as this does.",wja

15,Labetalol,High Blood Pressure,,,"April 3, 2009",103,"Normodyne (labetalol):I've used Normodyne for over 10 years with no side effects other than tiredness/fatigue which was tolerable until I began an exercise program with a personal trainer.  On several workout sessions which involved conditioning exercises. I felt extremely tired to the point of needing to stop.  Consulted with my doctor, he advised me that fatigue is a side effect of Normodyne and that a new medicine called Bystolic does not have this side effect.  I am now on Bystolic and will continue to monitor the results.",Anonymous
