1,Irbesartan,High Blood Pressure,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 5, 2022",2,"I'm a 42 year old female. I was put on 300mg Irbesartan as a starting dose for high blood pressure. I have been taking just half this dose. I wanted to see if I could control my blood pressure on a lower dose first. I have noticed changes since using Irbesartan:1. It has reduced my systolic blood pressure a great deal to a normal level. However my diastolic reading is still quite high.2. My periods, which have always been extremely regular, have suddenly become very irregular. 3. I have started falling asleep all the time, anywhere. I have never slept during the day in my life, so to suddenly find myself falling asleep in all manner of places and at any time, even shortly after waking in the morning, is very concerning.4. My ears keep popping which is odd and annoying.5. I feel sad and wistful a lot, which is unlike me.6. I have been feeling disconnected and numb.7. I have experienced a total loss of libido.",Anonymous

Thing is 4 months ago my local CVS changed supplier and now it’s JUBILANT  Generics, Roorkee India plant. Since then I had allergy symptoms  of congestion, sneezing, coughing. Had comprehensive blood panel done for over 100 known allergens and it all came back negative. Got 2 air purifiers, washed walls with wet swiffer and swapped out scented soaps for unscented. No change. So my simplistic analysis is that it’s impurities or different formulation of Irbesartan done by a different manufacturer that is causing my symptoms. Yesterday  I stopped taking the medication and extreme congestion and sinus side effects have all but disappeared.  May continue this experiment for 10 days.",Anon9

Then I started losing my ability to recall memories and experiences which gave me nightmares. It was so bad I felt my personality was going away. I finally quit and I started remembering things within two or three days. It made me emotional. My blood pressure is dangerously high but none of the other drugs are a good alternative. They denied the fact that a physical problem could cause this but my tests showed adrenal gland, kidney and liver problem as well as small blood vessels and a narrowed artery.

I started to wean off some of my medications to see what the culprit was but my BP went high. After an admission to hospital they commenced lisinopril and felt great until or the cough with severe choking  episodes came on. So, not convinced that Avapro had caused the previous problem, the doctor recommenced but at double the dose. I now have urinary frequency, swelling of the lower legs, episodes of tachycardia and irregular rhythm, low back pain, tendinitis in the R hip, sore hands, redness of the face, insomnia, numb fingers, sore muscles and positional dizziness.

8,Irbesartan,High Blood Pressure,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 25, 2020",16,"So far irbesartan seems to be doing a good job lowering my blood pressure, especially if my stress levels are low. The only thing I question is if it is making me wake up most mornings with tingling or slightly numb hands or fingers. Pins and needles feelings. As soon as I wake up (in the middle of the night or in the morning), that feeling is only momentary, then quickly goes away and is not present during the daytime or evening. My doctor says this hand/finger tingling is not related to irbesartan, but it started soon after beginning treatment with it. The frequency leads me to think it's not just sleeping the wrong way. I even saw ""tingling fingers/hands"" in a side effect list for this medication. It wouldn't be a no-go for me, but I just wish I knew if the morning hand tingling was or wasn't related to this medication.",Elaine

Weight loss has also helped with the drop in BP.  However, for the last 6 months I've noticed changes in my overall health which I'm thinking it's from the irbesartan.  This includes joint, back and neck pain, two chest and sinus infections which required antibiotics, and increased tinnitus in my left ear.  The neck pain has really increased over the last month, something I can attribute to any injury.  My BP has been around 120/80 on this medicine, so very happy but the side effects are taking its toll.  I plan on reducing the dose (75 mg per day) to see if side effects are reduced.",Mark

Without the drug it would be around 135/78.I found the correct dose through trial and error, logging BP readings twice a day. I wait 15 minutes after sitting to get resting BP.I was taking Prinston Irbesartan with good results until it was back ordered and Camber 75 mg Irbesartan was substituted. This did not work for me at all. It had no benefit for my blood pressure, which went up 10 to 20 points and was even elevated in the middle of the night. I tried doubling the dose to 75 mg but all I got was side effects.

I had been taking it for about 12 days before I began to show an allergic reaction to it. At first, there was a small blister on my ankle but by the third day this blister was spreading over my ankle and was hot and itchy.  I immediately went to my PCP thinking it might be shingles. Since my PCP was not sure it wasn't shingles that's what I was treated for. However after a week of taking the prescribed drugs I had gotten much worse. The RASH was now moving up my legs and over my buttocks and it was so painful it was intolerable at times. To make a very long story short I ended up in the ER twice and finally was able to find relief after one of the TOP Dermatologists in the area was able to identify through a biopsy that Avapro was the culprit since it was the only thing that had changed in my routine before the RASH started.",Ms B
