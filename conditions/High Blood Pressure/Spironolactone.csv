0,Spironolactone,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 7, 2021",0,"I have now been taking this medication for a month, I am a vegetarian there are certain fruits and vegetables I saw on line that I should not eat. My blood pressure is now lower then it has ever been like 98/67, I am starting to sleep all day through out the day just doze off. My blood glucose drops at night now. I took a half pill two days ago because my pressure had been low, that night I had serious heart palpitations. That day I felt great  having not taken it. I resumed the next day because of the palpitations, chest burning, low blood pressure, strange feeling in my head. I researched that the sleepiness is a result of lowered blood pressure. I went to another doctor who has communicated I shouldn't be taking this med. Have an appointment with my doctor next week as I reported the sleepiness and was informed by the nurse that I should take it at night, This med, the longer I take it the worst I feel. I also have experienced dry mouth and left side of the face having a weird feel",Renee
1,Spironolactone,High Blood Pressure,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 12, 2021",0,"I have several concerns about spironolactone, I am a vegetarian and have a prediabetic diagnosis also. I have been dealing with high blood pressure where my bottom number stays high. I have taken spironolactone for 8 days, but not 8 consecutive days, after taking this medication for 4 days I had diarrhea for two straight days. I stopped taking this medication. I contacted the health center and also went to the minor clinic. The minor clinic would not address the blood pressure medication but immediately thought I might have COVID because of the diarrhea. The health clinic that prescribed the medication stated that the diarrhea was probably something I had eaten. I noticed my leg muscles were achy.  was informed I had not been taking the medication long enough to give  it an opportunity to work. I resumed taking this medication after two days of no use. The following Tuesday a day after I resumed taking this medication I noticed my blood pressure readings were back high.",Renee

Later the MaxZide was discontinued. and my doc decided to give me 5 mg Lisinopril. I got Tachycardia from it (like 120 bpm resting pulse). After a month of that, it was discontinued and I was put on Metoprolol. After years of that my Systolic was a bit high. So he prescribed Clonidine. The combo took my pulse to high 40s. So he discontinued the Clonidine and had me take 25 mg Spironolactone. I love this med. I feel good! My pulse stayed low so now I'm only on the Spironolactone.

Aside from other side effects this drug can cause fever and chills - aka drug fever After taking it for a few days I woke up one morning with shaking chills and fever-which could easily be mistaken for an infection.

Effects will certainly still evolve, but in my case it lowers BP, makes me lose water, raises my low potassium, might help against my hirsutism (too early to tell), lowers my appetite and eliminates PMS. I have tried 8 other common BP meds before with side effects like cough, tinnitus, heart palpitations, fatigue and raised BP, and I started out with low potassium, fluid retention and hirsutism. Seems like a very good fit if you are in a similar situation..",Salsa

14,Spironolactone,High Blood Pressure,,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 20, 2018",22,"Used half a tab of 25mg daily for two weeks with a two day interval between the weeks due to rash developing near belly button. Upon resumption no further rashes, but instead a tendinitis flareup with it starting to spread to the ankle. So I stopped taking it. Lab results with this small amount showed potassium slightly out of range, 5.5 on a scale of 2-5.3.  The half tab didn't do a lot to keep BP down when added to 30mg Lisinipril I take. So I stopped taking it. I now believe most BP medicines were designed thinking someone from 60 up is sedentary. When one is a senior athlete I believe they leach something out of tendons and muscles causing problems.",HO (Handsome one)

Apparently the manufacturers of Par and Actavis decided to stop making this drug, and no one can figure out as to why. The manufacturer Cadista had stepped in and producing a brownish round pill that seems to do nothing for people who really need spironolactone for their health. Call the FDA, call your Physician, call your Pharmacist, and request that the spironolactone be manufactured by Par or Actavis which is a oval, white pill be reproduced so we can get back to being healthy again!

Continued taking this medication for another 3 weeks but my stomach was so messed up I still haven't gone back to eating meats.  Cramps have come back and today my primary, who didn't prescribe this medication said this medication was the culprit and took me off of it.  He stated the medication has all my electrolytes all out of balance. Other symptoms are extreme muscle weakness and uncontrollable drowsiness, sharp pains throughout my body, bad headaches, tightness in head, dizziness & unexplained confusion, very scary side effects.

In my case (50-ish female; long-term borderline hypertension, gradually increasing), (1) I developed MALE pattern hair loss. My part was very visible and looked bright white, as there were no longer enough follicles to fill in the part. The small hairs at my hairline were gone. The number of hairs is important, all over the scalp, to create fullness.(2) Over time (6-9 months), I noticed a complete lack of sexual interest and a blunted response.
