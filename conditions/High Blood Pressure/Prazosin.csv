3,Prazosin,High Blood Pressure,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 21, 2019",8,"Minipress (prazosin):Minipress was the first drug they tried for high blood pressure back in the late 80s, when I was in the Army.  I felt like it would be the end of me.  First of all, it made my BP higher than lower.  My heart sometimes felt like it was going to pop out of my chest sometimes.  I fainted a few times.  I would wake up at night and my back would fall asleep.  I had some sexual problems from it too.  They eventually had me on the max dose, and my BP was sky high.  Finally they weaned me off it and put me on lisinopril, which works really well for me.  My BP is now normal.",anonymous
4,Prazosin,High Blood Pressure,6.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 6, 2016",3,"Using this for parasomnia, bph and bp. Kind of silver bullet. But my new doc tried to give me the brand name... Is it an extended release or just much more expensive? I only take it at night and dizziness hasnt been an issue. Seems to work as well as other bph meds that I have tried, my bp has also been reasonable. Seems to make sleepwalking more infrequent which is why I tried it.",Brand name diff?
5,Prazosin,High Blood Pressure,10.0,,"March 29, 2016",15,"no medicine could lower my blood pressure from approx.145/ 90.  But prazonsin did it, 125 or less/ 65 or less, is fantastic, side effect like light headed, and a little weak or a little shaky. Note  I only take half tablet in the morning and nite before bed.Also , when the docter prescribe me prazonsin I was taking  telmisartan, and amlodipino, so I did take  40 mg. telmisartan, and one tablet prazosine, but I make a mistake and  taken  both at the same time,was to much pressure went down   to 73/44 and almost fainted.  I took some salt and cocacola to make this up but the recover was slow about 2 digits per hour, took near 24 hours,to arrive at a normal to 124/68.   So after this I decide to take this but only half in the morning and half at nite  my pressure today,  140/70 pulse 49 rite at wake up, after prazosine, 3 hours later,122/66  pulse 72.",Anonymous

10,Prazosin,High Blood Pressure,10.0,,"March 3, 2011",40,"Minipress (prazosin):Used this to replace Tenormin which was causing sexual problems (total erectile dysfunction) and mood issues.  Taking 1mg daily at night.  No ED difficulties, in fact, it has the opposite effect for me, like a daily use ED drug.  Blood pressure controlled just as effectively and my mood is back to normal, but not sure if that's because the ED issues are resolved or if Tenormin was impacting my mood.",Anonymous
