The head fog went away, blood pressure went down, I slept better, curbed my appetite. I just felt SO MUCH better. But then the horrendous dry cough started. It was awful.

3,Lisinopril,High Blood Pressure,2.0,,"February 16, 2022",2,"I have been taking lisinopril 5 mg for several years now. Eventually developed peripheral neuropathy. This nerve damage is painful and debilitating, and causes unsteadiness in walking. My research has found that ALL blood pressure medications ending in RIL such as LISINIPRIL are on the TOP 10 LIST of medications that will cause peripheral neuropathy! Along with that are Statin drugs!  After suffering from nerve damage and learning about the Statin drugs, I quit taking simvastatin. But could not understand why the neuropathy continued to get worse anyway, Only to find out that lisinopril, which I had continued to take also causes peripheral neuropathy. Drug manufacturers produce these medication‘s to supposedly help or cure one problem, but they do not care even one bit how much other damage it can do to the patient. So to control cholesterol and blood pressure, I now have major serious nerve damage, thanks to these drugs!!",Damaged
4,Lisinopril,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 8, 2022",0,"Years ago, I was taking lisinopril and started to get very tired to the point I could not walk not even a short distance. Dr did all blood test to check if there was a heart, lung problem, cancer, asbestos etc. Xray showed liquid in my lungs. So he started to drain liquid from my lungs. My lungs continue to build fluids. After surgery found nothing wrong with my lungs. Liquid started to accumulate in my left lung. I was panicking and praying. Finally, I started to write and remember how long I have been taking Lisinopril and realized that my problem started around the time I started taking Lisinopril. I told my Dr that I suspected it was Lisinopril so stopped taking it. Days and weeks later like a miracle I felt like new. At that time my Dr told me that I was the only incidence with this reaction in the medical journal. BEWARE OF THIS.",Alexander
5,Lisinopril,High Blood Pressure,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 8, 2022",0,"I was prescribed Lisinopril 5mg for HBP about 5 years ago.  I got my prescription from Walgreens and it was a small round pink pill.  It helped my BP and worked well.  Then about a year ago, they switched to an oblong yellow pill.  I was told by pharmacist it was same drug.  After a week I noticed pressure behind my eyes again and felt meh.  I asked to switch back to pink pills but they said ""no can do"".  So I stayed on yellow pills.  Moving a year and half ahead, I've been noticing some heart palpitations, high resting heart rate and overall feeling of ""not myself"".  Finally switched pharmacies and started pink pills again yesterday.  Hoping this helps me.  Anyone else notice a marked change when getting off the Solco pills?",JSR

She actually laughed when hearing of my neck and shoulder pain ""I've never heard of this."" She actually asked if I'm sure I  didn't do something to cause it.

After looking at my bald spots, he discontinued Lisinopril, so I am hoping for some improvement.   It is a rare reaction, but  it is very real.

It took a while to find another medication to control my blood pressure but it was all worth it. However, it is effective for blood pressure. All medications have side effects but it seems to me that this one a lot of people have problems with so with all the other medications on the market why would you try something like this and why would the doctor prescribe it to a patient that has asthma chronic asthma.

This has been very effective at keeping my blood pressure in check. Then, when Walgreens made the switch to Solco as the manufacturer, I started to get all sorts of symptoms (serious back rash, dizziness, low blood sugar, headaches, and more). At first, I wondered if I developed an allergy to a food that I was eating (as I have been in medicine for nearly 22 years). Then, magically, when I stopped taking the Solco version of Lisinopril all of these symptoms went away. It was the only thing I could think of as the cause. Now, my blood pressure is running around 140/85 and I'll work with my doctor on an appropriate medication if I see any spikes. This company needs to be investigated. I am troubled, indeed.",Yaakov

After a month of being on this, I developed a really bad cough, coughing all the time.  Then I started getting shortness of breath. I though it was asthma, my inhaler helped but never got rid of the cough. Now the shortness of breath is getting worse, I  have lower back pain, tingling in my hands which comes and goes.  I  told my doctor she said it should pass but  it's been a year and it hasn't past. The cough is getting worse so I think I'll stop this pill before it does anymore damage and then I'll find a new doctor as well.

I'm only 38 years old and gained weight that contributed to the high BP and  also my lifestyle job didn't help my BP. So far so good for me.

24,Lisinopril,High Blood Pressure,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 23, 2021",4,"I basically have generally positive review, but there are some issues which I have with this medication - mostly dealing with the dosing. I originally was prescribed 5 mg of lisinopril many years ago. The medication was to be taken once per day.  The medication did a fine job! Had no side effects, and blood pressure was well controlled. Fast forward to earlier this year: my doctor wrote a prescription for 20mg lisinopril, dosed twice per day. My blood pressure went up to 160/105. I simply cannot handle lisinopril dosed twice daily - even with another medication like metoprolol ER added to the mix.  Additionally, the side effects - including a nasty burning sensation in my chest and dry, hacking cough appeared. None of those side effects showed up when taking lisinopril once a day.",cubfan84

After 2 weeks I ended up in the ER for severe vomiting and small bowel inflammation. A quick internet search turned up an article on Lisinopril induced inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. I stopped for one week then restarted a 5 mg/ day dose. Two weeks later I had terrible upper GI/ esophageal pain that resolved when I stopped the medication. My doctor seemed a bit skeptical that the medication was causing GI symptoms, but given the documented reports of these side effects I stopped taking it and have not had a relapse of symptoms.

29,Lisinopril,High Blood Pressure,1.0,,"April 14, 2021",4,"I was switched to lisinopril from atenolol because it appeared  atenolol (taken for years but recent dosage increase) caused  rash on my neck.

BP still high, doctor said go up to 20 mg of lisinopril. Took another 10 mg within 2 hours, neck swelling, face and mouth began to itch. I knew angioedema was a side effect of Lisinopril because it happened to my 26 year old son when he took it for his blood pressure.  Went to the ER, was told it was reaction to the drug.  Knee started to hurt at the same time. Within 24-48 hours of stopping Lisinopril, rash, swelling, skin thickening began to go away. Within 3 days, skin still red, but all blistering, flaking, and raised areas gone. Knee pain has not gotten better and is actually worse when I try to stretch or exercise.

I’ve been having the same problem as others. This Solco lisinopril caused my blood pressure to spike and felt completely different than the old generic brand.

Never had health issues of any kind and don’t bother with doctors but decided maybe I better get a primary care physician for this. Well when I went to the primary for the first time,  my bp was 146/84  much lower than the clinic. I suspect the bug bite had something to do with that.

Two weeks in, I experienced a sustained accelerated pulse rate and went into the doctor’s office. We decided the pulse rate could be due to an interaction between the Lisinopril and some decongestants I had been taking. I was prescribed antibiotics in case I had a sinus infection. Two weeks later, after reading reviews on line, that my symptoms might be a reaction to the Lisinopril. I stopped taking it and, within two days, felt much better.

BP would be good sometimes but shoot up when I went to the doctor (possible white coat syndrome but it wouldn't go down much) and heart rate would be elevated 90's to low 100's resting. Switched to coreg 12.5 mg a day with lexapro 5 mg to lower anxiety. Pain went away and lowered heart rate but stopped the lexapro after third night because I felt hot and trouble sleeping but maybe should have stuck with it. Coreg would work somewhat but BP could go up if I felt the slightest bit anxious or angry. Dumped my doctor and switched to a new one. New doc prescribed 50 mg of metoprolol and back to the 5mg lexapro to help the shakes and anxiety. Start the metoprolol tomorrow and lexapro a couple days later so hopefully this works.
