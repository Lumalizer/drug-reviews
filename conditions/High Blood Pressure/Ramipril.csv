I was very reluctant as I don't like taking any medication and very wary of all medications. However I took it and it works fine for me. I don't have any side effects.

Also it depletes zinc from your body (important for immune system) , use iron supplement, B-complex and D3 vitamins they helps with the cough caused by Ramipril. Usual bp meds side effects tiredness/fatigue, so i use it in the evening. On the other hand Ramipril is still much more effective for me than horrible Amlodipine or useless Propranolol I don't even mention pathetic dehydrating, gastro damaging diuretics...",Robb

8,Ramipril,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 27, 2021",8,"My Lipidologist prescribed Ramipril 10mg 2x/day beginning on 4.15.21 to begin treating my elevated BP 140's - 160+. He warned of potential coughing side effect, as this med belongs to the ACE category of artery ""relaxers"". My coughing and throat tightening type spasms like a hot flash began immediately and kept me waking up at night. He said it was the best for preventing a stroke, so I tried it over 40 days, with minimal lower results, although I did see a few 120's which was encouraging. I could no longer continue this med to due excessive side effects, which are starting to diminish now that I have stopped Ramipril.My MD switched me to Telmisartan(Micardis), which is in the ARB category of artery meds and typically does not have the coughing side effect. He has added a water pill, so I am beginning to get more consistent lower readings and no apparent side effects ""YET""?",PhilipElb

Within weeks I had developed blurred and double vision. My optician referred me to the Ophthalmologist. I had to contact my GP for the referral and he changed my medication to Losartan.  I had no issues with my eye and when I returned to my optician 18 months later he said my condition had reversed and this was the first time he'd come across double vision as a side effect of Ramipril.,Weeneilly

I  don't read side effects I just asked my partner to see if you get rashes as I did get one the size of a 10p which is going down though. But is has been great, I feel fab, I  eat healthy anyway. I would recommend though to make small changes and educate in where changes in life style could change to help you. Like yoga, food, things that u enjoy and bring a bit of calmness to u.

I had an aching back for the first two weeks but that settled, today after four weeks I have a slight headache but suspect that is the cold weather rather than the tablets. I am taking mine at night as read this was better to avoid the early morning increase in BP and also so if there was dizziness I'd be asleep so would be ok. Not due back to Drs for another two months so will continue monitoring and will call him if things change before then. Fingers crossed this will continue to be ok for me.",Codie

As it was too high and I was at the risk of having stroke, I decided to take it.Right from the next day, my highest BP was  150/97. I normally get up early for prayer. This morning just after I got up, the BP reading was 112/77.To me it this is working at the cost of some less serious side effects such as occasional dry cough, feeling  little bit of nausea, eyes boring ( it was worse when I slept 6 hours and it was not there when I slept for 7), feeling of as if I have a very low level of fever. I needed something to make the BP down and I glad this worked. Mind you I am taking  5 mg a day.  I suppose, any dose lesser than that would have much lesser side effects on me.

My BP did drop to around 120/80 though. But have recently found the dizziness started to affect me a bit more, especially walking in busy shops. I've gone to the GP to ask for a lower dosage of 1.25mg. I've only been on it for 3 days. My BP has gone up slightly around 125/80. But I shall monitor that over the next few weeks.  I've also noticed the 1.25mg has given me a slightly more drier throat. Not sure if it is do with the coating of the capsule as the medicine should be the same as before. If BP goes up anymore and dizziness is the same I shall go back to the usual 2.50mg dosage, I will have just got to live with it.",guy355

Added in Amlodipine and again no change.I started looking at what tablets I'm already taking as I had really bad itching and a dry mouth all day. Amitriptyline stood out on the side effects but it also had as a side effect, high blood pressure. So after reading that last week I just stopped taking it and my blood pressure is now normal again.What really gets my back up about this is, (in my case anyway) the doctors didn't look to see what I was already taking for pain relief and see if that could be causing the high b/p , they just throw more tablets at you and hope it works instead of putting some thought into it. If anyone on here is taking Ramipril or whatever one and it isn't helping, I would suggest looking at what you are all ready on and see if that could be causing the high blood pressure.

BP escalated to an alarming rate - seven hour nosebleed - if this is not an isolated instance of such a severe reaction - strongly suggest it NEVER be prescribed to patients known to have severe kidney impairment. Would be interesting to know if any mortality studies have been done regarding the use of this drug on kidney dialysis patients. Noted that it raises the level of potassium in the blood which I suggest of itself is an indication that its use in such patients is perhaps contraindicated.,hound
