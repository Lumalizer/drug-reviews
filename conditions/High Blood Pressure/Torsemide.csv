0,Torsemide,High Blood Pressure,4,,"September 18, 2017",18,I am a Type 2 diabetic with high blood pressure.  I was hospitalized with heart failure due to too much liquid in my system.  After leaving the hospital in June I was on lasix. Then the doctor changed me from lasix to torsemide at the end of June.  With change in medications I had the following issues.40 mg twice a day: Extreme HeadachesVery high blood sugar for me (235-275)Low blood pressure (sometimes 90/60)Dehydration20 mg twice a day:Lowered Blood Pressure (almost too much)Blood sugar is in  the 190-220 range and I can't get it to a lower number.  Originally at 110-125.LethargicDizzinessI keep getting told the medication is not really responsible for the blood sugar rising like it has.  Too much of a coincidence for me.,CH927
