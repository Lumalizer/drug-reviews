0,Zebeta,High Blood Pressure,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 12, 2019",76,"After experiencing induced hypertriglyceridemia with long term use of Tenormin (50mg/day), and finding metoprolol to be useless, I have been using bisoprolol (5mg/2x day) for more than 10 years with outstanding results.  As a side effect (bonus), bisoprolol reduces triglyceride and LDL levels and increases HDL.  As a person that has been dealing with hypertension for around 40 years, I strongly recommend bisoprolol as the beta blocker of choice.",John
1,Zebeta,High Blood Pressure,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 14, 2018",29,"After 7 years of taking this medicine, it still works to reduce my blood pressure. If I go without it for 3 days or more, my heart gets sluggish, painful, and works too hard even if I am just sitting or laying down. It relieves most of the pain and the terrible headache",TheRightMrsMetz
