1,Valsartan,High Blood Pressure,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 21, 2021",3,"I was having some high blood pressure issues for a while before I decided to go to my dr and get it taken care of. I was feeling a lot of pressure in my head, no appetite, extreme anxiety, headaches constantly with some dizziness and feeling light headed and always tired. So she prescribed me this medicine  I’ve been on valsartan for 3 weeks I have no more headaches the dizziness and feeling lightheaded and my anxiety went way down as well as my bp staying within normal limits. I don’t feel 100 percent back to my old self just yet. I’m still getting extremely fatigued at times but I personally think it’s due to not drinking enough water be aware you need to stay hydrated on this medicine. But other than that I was feeling like I had no energy or motivation before starting this medicine and i feel like my quality of life has drastically improved so far. I was scared to take it but I wish I could have started sooner. Don’t be afraid it’s a long road but you will be ok.",Erika

NOT ALL GENERIC DRUGS ARE CREATED EQUAL! A good experience with one manufacturer's drug does not mean you'll have the same experience with a different manufacturer's product.  If you have had an unpleasant experience with a generic drug, discuss with your care provider (MD, NP) whether it would be worth it to try a different manufacturer's version of the same drug.  If you have been taking a generic drug for a good while and then notice that you're not doing so well, talk to your care provider, but also bring that up with the pharmacy and find out whether they have changed  vendors!",RN  CNS

Then suddenly I developed low potassium levels; fluctuating blood pressure, rapid pulse, ringing in the ears, nausea and deep tissue pain with chronic inflammation. The dose was dropped by 1/2. Sleep apnea began. It took three months- many-ER visits, two hospitalizations and cardiac monitoring to figure out what my blood pressure was actually doing. Eventually it took only 1/4 of the dose of the medication to ""control"" my pressure without causing side effects.  The onset of these symptoms without doctors recognizing them created concern for me about this medication. I recommend regular monitoring of your own blood pressure.",rkm123
