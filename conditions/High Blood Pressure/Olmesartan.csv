0,Olmesartan,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 10, 2022",0,I've been on this for 2 months now and my blood pressure is still high.  I also take 25mg of Hydroch with it daily.  Doesn't work like Lisinopril but I can't take it due to the cough.   Now I will need to ween off Olmesartain because it's a dangerous drug to quit,pepi4
1,Olmesartan,High Blood Pressure,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 12, 2021",1,"Benicar (olmesartan):I have taking Benicar  HCTZ 40-25 FOR 15YRS The name has changed to the generic Olmesartan I wasn't happy with the name change because I don't know if it's the same medication, I assume it is. I've been taken Benicar along with Atenolol 100mg and those two combinations work great together, I never have or had any problems with this medication. I also don't have migraines like I use to. I have no complaints or problems with the medication, I actually like it, my Dr 15yrs ago put me on it and said this is what he prescribes his patients and if it's good enough for my Dr's parents it's good enough for me. No complaints. I see some of these reviews states they have feet pain, but if these people are diabetes the feet and muscle pain could come from neuropathy. My ins won't cover it.",Benicar HCTZ 40-25
2,Olmesartan,High Blood Pressure,1.0,,"July 13, 2021",0,"This drug was awful for me. The day after my first dose I started getting a cold, headache and diarrhea.  I also had insomnia. The cold and the headache got worse every day. By the 3rd day my head felt like it was gonna explode! I could barely function. Not to mention I was only getting about 3 hours of sleep a night because of the insomnia. Shooting pains across the crown of my head that wrapped around to both temples. Sinus pressure up my nose and right above not eyebrows.  I took myself off it it before my 4th dose.  It did very little to control my bp. There has to be something better out there.",SMA
3,Olmesartan,High Blood Pressure,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 14, 2021",4,Was on valsartan generic made by Macleods Pharmaceuticals Limited. I tried olmesartan from the same company. REALLY had problems with both of these. The valsartan at 160 mg/day made me have fainting and my BP would go to 180 or so after days at 130. It was unpredictible. Finally got Olmesartan made by Accord at started with 20mg/day. This put my BP pretty low so I started with 15mg/day. Still working with this. Have had side effects of feeling weak with 20mg/day. I have tinnitus and the Valsartan did not help this at all. I firmly believe that the BP meds I have been taking started this. Hoping Olmesartan will be better.,rimshoes
4,Olmesartan,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 30, 2021",5,"Extremely bad experience after only 2 doses of non generic olmesartan. Am seeing my doctor tomorrow to change.  I went to see the chemist yesterday after work as I was concerned with the symptoms.  The chemist advised symptoms can hang around for a week or so.  After the first 20mg pill in the morning,  I woke at 2.30am & had leg aches. I took 2nd pill in the morning with breakfast & by the time I got to work my legs felt like lead. I had sharp pains down my legs. My hip bones felt like I was some arthritic 100 year old. I had difficulty walking. My head ached. I began to get forgetful to the point where it alarmed me. On coming home , even my husband noticed I was different.  Today I didn't take this drug which I'm now calling poison!! I still have bad lower back & hip ache despite not taking it today.

5,Olmesartan,High Blood Pressure,10.0,,"April 20, 2021",49,"Benicar (olmesartan):Been on 20mg Benicar for decade (I am 72). Works great.  Took  cheaper generic made by Glenmark & developed bronchitis..   Do your research when switching to any generic. Look to see if there’s an authorized generic. If not, ask about other pharmaceutical companies that make generic. These companies can add fillers to the brand formula.  CVS Caremark  gave me three more suppliers they could get a generic from. An internet search for generic Olmesartan Medoximil (Benicar) along with the manufacturing company gave the ingredients used to compare to the Benicar-Brand produced by Sankyo. Accord Pharmaceuticals’  list of ingredients looks identical to Sankyo’s Brand Benicar. I’m hoping the Accord generic will work like Brand Benicar, as Accord cost is about $13/month. Much better than $2K for Sankyo-produced brand Benicar.  Hope this info helps.",baybrooke

I haven’t taken my BP yet on this med, but I feel much better after my first dose. My heart isn’t pounding. Doc told me 2 things-make sure I drink lots of water and I may feel dizzy upon standing because this med opens (dilates) the blood vessels. I had the dizziness couple of times but that always happened before my BP was high. After we get back to semi normal I hope to be able to stop taking",CM

The first day, I had no issues and it did seem to lower my BP that evening.  The next 4 days, the issues piled on.  The worst was the chest pain, chest tightness, insomnia, and pressure in my head.  I started off with 40 mg but quickly realized it was too much so cut it in half.  Even with half a pill, I continue to have symptoms.

I tried the gamut of BP meds all producing the desired results but all having the same varying side effects most often a dry cough.  Then I tried Benicar 20mg.  It lowered my BP, but, I was extremely lethargic.  Started to take it at night but then couldn't get up in the morning.  I cut my tablets into quarters and started taking 5mg instead of 20mg.  My BP remained fine at 5mg and I stayed at that does for 12 years without any side effects.  At 66 years old I switched to a vegetarian diet and within half a year my BP began to drop too low.  I reduced my dosage to 5mg every-other-day and my BP was still too low.  I stopped taking Benicar altogether and have not found it necessary to go back on it for nearly 18 months now.

15,Olmesartan,High Blood Pressure,1.0,,"March 8, 2020",38,I husband of 18 years was on this rubbish olmesartan for 6 months and it made him into a lunatic. It took me over 7 months to get him back to the doctor to get his meds changed. Became absolutely bipolar on this medication. It was like he had a demon in his body that would make him hateful to everyone. My husband before this med was laid back and a joy to be around. It had to come down to a now or never declaration to get his attention since he became the leader of the He man's woman haters club. 2 days in to new med and I see the demon fading. This stuff is brutal.  I recommend you personally drag yourself or your spouse kicking and screaming from first week. Praying and wishing isn't going to change anything with this medicine.,crosslady

I experienced loose bowels as soon as I started on Olmesartan, but stuck with it as it did a bang up job on getting my BP down and online reviews stated that these symptoms could last a couple to three weeks.  Sure enough, after three weeks, no more problems!  I did communicate with my doctor about the symptoms after a week, but told him that I wanted to stay the course and see if the symptoms would quit quickly.

I first thought I was having a heart attack, though I had no other symptoms. I immediately sought medical treatment. My heart was fine. I had no other respiratory symptoms such as wheezing or strider which could indicate bronchitis, Asthma, or anaphylactic reaction.
