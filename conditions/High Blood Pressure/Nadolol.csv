0,Nadolol,High Blood Pressure,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 6, 2021",1,"Works very well for blood pressure. Much less side effects than metoprolol , atenolol , carvedilol. My pulse is 55-60 on 40 mg nadolol with a consist BP 125/75 . Also works well with my BPH and cholesterol meds. Beta blockers are the only medications that control my BP at a low enough dose to not bring on unwanted side effects .",Sabrina1234
