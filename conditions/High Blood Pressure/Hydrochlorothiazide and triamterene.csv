1,Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 12, 2021",7,"This pill is great at first, but after taking the drug for six years, I began to develop one side effect and then I looked at all the other problems I had been experiencing and identified at least 20. All reported to my Dr who  only offered other treatments or specialist that only addressed the symptoms and not the side effect. I experienced, severe nerve pain, nose bleeds, bloating, bad headaches, knee joint inflammation, limited mobility, vision loss, hair loss, rash, loss of thoughts, fatigue, irritability, constipation,  etc and not all at the same time but over time. In conclusion this pill is a really no good for me and slowly works you into to pop a pill culture. Do not recommend, completely switched to homeopathic solutions and doing much better.",Tdepay

3,Hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene,High Blood Pressure,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 24, 2020",1,On 37.5 dose for BP for 5 days now.   Already taking Carvedilol for heart rhythm (low dose) and Losartan 100mg also for BP.  My doctor suggested this drug to help with Potassium levels since a previous diuretic caused me all kinds of heart rhythm issues.  Was fine until today (day 5) and now getting some of my unusual heart beats. No other side effects noticed yet.  I will see how it goes but hoping it will stabilize and my heart will stop with the rhythm issue.  Took BP 3 times today  140/96 136/102 145/87....none are great.  Was hoping to see a bigger drop by now.  Was running about 157/102 prior.  Fingers crossed but may have to look for a different path forward.,Mikey
