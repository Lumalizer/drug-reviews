3,Norvasc,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 25, 2021",4,Norvasc has to be the worst blood pressure medication out there. This medication should be banned. I took a low dose 2.5 for a week and within a few days extreme facial and hands flushing. I started to develop rash all over my knuckles which very odd. I was very light headed and dizzy. I had really bad stomach pain. How the heck can anyone take this medication. It should be banned. It didn’t even help my blood pressure that much. I stopped after a week of the junk. It took 2 weeks for the side effects to completely go away. Never again.,Scott

After 3 week feet and toes started drawing up then hands started doing the same. The 5 week chest muscle cramps and spasms so bad I thought I was having a heart attack. Went to ER with no help. Them I started researching Norvasc and came across others that had the same symptoms I had. I started cutting back mg now Norvasc free and all cramps and spasms gone.

8,Norvasc,High Blood Pressure,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 24, 2020",8,"At first, it's quite effective - and it significantly does work - to lower blood pressure. It has few side effects, and works within 30min - 1.5hrs. The only downside is that it can take 6-8hrs to achieve the full drop, and tolerance develops shortly - about 4 months - after taking it regularly. It's a good step above diuretics, but it's not enough by itself. Combining it with Lisinopril is much better than Norvasc alone.",Katluv

Most of my BP readings is 145/85; I told my primary physician that my now ankles  swell; a chronic headache  after I take it; and earache.  I went to ENT and took a battery of tests which ENT then referred me for a brain scan.  I am debating on that referral.  I stopped taking amlodipine on 9/6 and went to my rheumatologist on 9/11; without taking bp my reading was 143/84  I have come to the conclusion, I want something other than amlodipine.

14,Norvasc,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 19, 2019",153,Horrible med I started to have swollen tongue and lips and face. Also hands and feet were swollen. I stopped taking it and slept the night sitting up. I felt depressed and anxiety irritable no energy. I almost died on lisinopril having to rush to hospital with terrible swollen tongue even uvula. They gave me every shot they had which I thought I might die from. Adrenaline shot is the worst. After a few months on norvasc at night laying down each night it got harder to breathe especially through my nose. This is my second day off and I bought 4 natural remedies and I finally feel like myself. I had no desire to do anything. I think these medicines are like poison. I can’t take them and I won’t no matter what. I will do whatever I need to. I almost choked to death trying too swallow scrambled eggs. I am totally done with bp meds unless they are natural. My throat is still bothering me but getting better.,Sue
15,Norvasc,High Blood Pressure,1.0,,"September 7, 2019",86,"I was taken off of Procardia XL and moved to Norvasc.  After being on this drug for a few months I started going through some changes.  My sex drive was declining rapidly, my blood pressure and weight were going up as was my anxiety level.  I spoke to my physician about placing me back on the Procardia and he refused.   With in two years my weight was up over 40lbs, my sex drive was that of an old man and I was 42.  I left my fiancee out of pure loss of interest in women.  My blood pressure was way up as was my anxiety level.  I was now being treated for anxieties.   I spent twenty years on that drug, I gained over 100 lbs and my blood pressure was high, I was treated with Testosterone replacement therapy, an out of pocket expense of over 600 a month.

Constant leg cramps, heavy legs, migraines, elevated liver enzymes (fatty liver disease) and worst of all a dull isolated personality like I wasn’t myself anymore.

I've been taking this garbage for 35 years and have had a multiple of effects from it not realizing this whole time it was this prescription causing it.  I've seen so many doctors about my side effects. They all knew I was taking Norvasc, but not one ever mentioned that it could be a side effect of this drug.  I've had peripheral neuropathy (feels like someone has poured hot lava down my thighs and is dripping to my feet).  I've had tinnitus, itchy rashes breaking out on my body, headaches galore, and at 62 years old, I now have TMJ. Yes, I'm blaming my TMJ (temporomandibular joint dysfunction) on this drug.  It has caused my leg muscles to tighten up and I imagine it's doing the same thing to my jaw.  It did control my blood pressure well, but I'd rather not take any meds if this is how I have to live the rest of my life.  I took myself off of 2 years ago, but could not get through the withdrawals.  It caused my heart to feel like it was beating out of my chest and non stop migraines.",ruinedmylife

Always had a bit of vertigo so can't attest to the dizziness claims. Doesn't work as well as my previous Lopressor/Micardis regimen I was on but we'll see.

This time around my doctor tried me on norvasc 5mg. As soon as I started taking it my blood pressure went up, my feet and ankles swelled and I got headaches. I also had a bad panic attack and my blood pressure went sky high. It didn’t control it whatsoever. I haven’t taken it today or yesterday so I went to the grocery to take my bp to see what it was. My kids were fighting so I assumed it was going to be high and it was actually better than it’s been in a few weeks. Don’t recommend this medication.

25,Norvasc,High Blood Pressure,5.0,,"January 31, 2018",43,"I'm 55 and 195 lbs. Was on 5mg Norvasc after repeated BP readings of 160+/80. Norvasc brought my BP down to 140/80 for the first 3 months.  Then I started getting heart palpitations. I would also start feeling flushed & dizzy. It became progressively worse to the point I couldn't stand because of my dizziness. Heart palpitations occurred frequently.  Doctor took blood, EKG and also did two stress tests. All were negative (BP went back up to 165/75 - on average).I stopped taking Norvasc after 6 months, Doctor put me on 10mg Lisinopril.  As my diet improved over the past 6 months (I have always done cardio), I stopped any BP meds.  It been 24 days and my BP (which I take several times a day) hovers between 120/75 to 141/82. I'm no longer dizzy or feel flush.  Still get heart palpitations every few hours that hasn't fully been explained.  Bottom line is (IMO), I can do without meds by having changed my diet (which was good to start with - Just needed to make some adjustments).",Handsome Howard

52,Norvasc,High Blood Pressure,,,"December 26, 2014",117,I've only been on Norvasc for a week and so far the only side effect is difficulty falling asleep and waking up periodically through the night. I know its the Norvasc since I work a very early shift and am generally exhausted by the time its ready for bed. If it continues I'll look into switching medications. However the first blood pressure medication I was on has a worse side effect. Uncontrollable coughing. I had to stop taking it after about a month.,PTBadman

That's great.  Problem is with side effects every day.  Intestinal cramps, diarrhea, gas. Begins about 5 hours after I take the pill.  Stomach (intestines ?) roll constantly for about 3 hours. I am going to try splitting the pills in half and see if lower dosage stops the side effects.  If not, I guess I'll go back to the doctor and try something else for blood pressure.
