0,Hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril,High Blood Pressure,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 12, 2022",0,I was on this for 3 years. Just the 10 mg and then I’d cut that pill in 1/2. It really worked to keep my BP safe. I did have an occasional tickle cough. Then summer came an I burned like I never had before. My eyes couldn’t handle any sunlight without a burning feeling. It was terrible. I eventually took myself off the medicine and my sun problems cleared up within a week.,Reaction to Sun
1,Hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril,High Blood Pressure,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 8, 2022",1,"This medication almost crippled me! Over the course of a year, my joints became so painful that I could barely climb or descend stairs without crying out in pain. This just started out of nowhere; I was perfectly able bodied then - crippled. I started researching arthritis, MS, etc. On a side note, I ran out of blood pressure meds and went without for almost 2 weeks. Miraculously, my legs and knees got noticeably better each day! I figured it was a coincidence and started my BP meds again. All the joint pain came back. I did not truly make a connection until I stopped my meds again for 3 days and I was able to deal with the stairs almost pain free! This time I am convinced there is a connection with the Lisinopril HCTZ and looked online: there it is - muscle and joint pain! It is worth noting that I was on this med for 2 years before this happened to me. It does control my BP. So, it can start at anytime. Be aware.",Betty

7,Hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril,High Blood Pressure,5.0,,"April 15, 2021",6,"I'm 61 y.o. and have been taking lisinopril / hydrochlorothiazide  ( 20mg / 25mg) for over 10 years for high blood pressure.  Over the last 3 years I developed symptoms of neuropathy in both feet, and in the last several months,  irregular heartbeat,  spikes in blood pressure, and near-constant headaches.     I was recently evaluated for vascular problems in feet and lower legs; this was ruled out.   However, my foot pain is constant, and sometimes it results in shooting pains up to my knees.   For an unknown reason this foot pain often increases right after a meal.   I am to undergo heart ""stress tests""  to be followed with some sort of nerve tests in both feet.    If these other tests do not point to any known cause, I will ask my doctor to switch me  to another blood pressure medication.",Tina

So far no side effects, but I have a noticed an increase in muscle cramps, charley horse painful ones.  Not sure what to do about the cramping. I'll do some research and see if I need to eat something that will reduce the cramping.  My doctor does test me frequently for kidney function, but so far no negative effects on my kidneys.",mooneymom
9,Hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril,High Blood Pressure,1.0,,"December 16, 2020",52,"I started this drug combo hydrochlorothiazide with lisinopril 3 years ago and I didn’t realize what it was doing to me.  I began to suffer serious joint pain, numbness / tingling in hands and feet and overall muscle pain which continued to increase over the last 3 years.  The Dr diagnosed me with an auto immune disorder as I went from a perfectly healthy 55-year-old male to a crippled in 3 years.  I couldn’t do anything.  Through experimentation and never wanting to accept that I just all of a sudden had succumb to an auto immune disease I began eliminating supplements, drugs and foods from my diet 2 weeks ago I finally weaned off of lisinopril and I am 100% sure that this was the cause of ALL of my ailments.  I am on the road to a full recovery as every day my symptoms are improving significantly and are mostly gone.  My life was ruined for 3 years on this drug. Stay Away from it or at least be aware of the symptoms early on so you can stop it.",CK

I truly felt that this medication was damaging me, but fear of stroking out and believing the fable that stopping these drugs WILL cause  ""rebound"" back to the extremes that got you on it kept me taking it.On hydrochlorothiazide with lisinopril had tremors, insomnia, extreme fatigue, severe muscle aches and pains, even at time feeling  impending DOOM - you name IT - finally was seen chronic renal failure !

12,Hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 15, 2020",18,"I used lisinopril for approx 4 years with no noticeable negative effects, suddenly I began having severe nausea and lack of energy, I attributed it to the heat at the time. It didn't appear to make a difference what I ate, or drank, it came back up, then I started to feel dizzy upon standing, and noticed an inability to see anything but white fog until the dizziness disappeared. I finally went to the Dr who did blood work. Next morning I was given a diagnosis of end stage renal failure. I was in stage 4. The first thing he did was take me off lisinopril, which he said was the culprit. He then referred me to a nephrologist who confirmed his thought and he started me on Tekturna. Luckily and to his astonishment the kidney disease regressed from stage 4 to stage 2. I am fortunate this drug didn't finish me off, but I now have permanent kidney disease, and can't take anything metabolised through the kidney. Avoid this medication at any cost, it is dangerous",Me

It lowered my blood pressure significantly from the 150s to the 120s but the side affects are painful. I have aching pain on the left side of my chest plus a cough as well as some dizziness when I lay down on my right side. I had to cut my pill in half to minimize these effects but I will let the Dr know on my next visit. I would like to stop it altogether but I worry about rebound hypertension.,Tru4u

Had daily diarrhea first thing in the morning, ongoing sinus issues (woke up most mornings with a sinus headache), zero tears, etc.  After a sudden onset of several eye floaters in one eye, I did some research and stopped taking it.  About a week after stopping, I woke up with my eyes oozing thick fluid.  I thought my eyes were leaking ocular fluid.  It was tears!!!  Eyes floaters considerable lessened after two weeks.  Have switched to low dose Losartan.  So far, the only effect I've noticed is a slight headache and sleepiness ( so I take it will dinner).

22,Hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril,High Blood Pressure,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 20, 2018",41,As I struggled with side affects from this drug I looked for others who were experiencing the same issues. Yes I had the cough but the stomach upset was the worst. Didn't see that this was a problem with others. My doctor said the med could not cause the constant explosive diarrhea I was experiencing. I took imodiom and started ulcer meds. I then submitted a stool sample and was looking at an endoscopy. My instincts said it had to be the drug so after 3 months of misery I got on a new bp drug and stomach is fine!!!  So angry that the doc didn't listen to me sooner and kept saying I had a virus or food poisoning. So yes this drug does cause terrible stomach issues for some people so I hope this helps someone else who is dealing what I was. DON'T WAIT 3 months to get a different drug!,MS E

It has been effective in controlling my hypertension. Recently my pharmacy switched to Watson Labs brand of Lisinopril HCTZ. The blue pills are thin and concave, about 1 cm in diameter. This shape causes the pill to stick in my throat. It is very difficult to swallow, causing me to choke almost every time. It is the worse possible shape for a pill.

It is effective at lowering my diastolic bp which is good but I'm also trying to  eat foods that would help with my blood pressure that contain potassium and that's where the nightmare begins.   I wasn't feeling well and I noticed a lot of discomfort after I ate bananas.   Because  Lisinopril  works by causing  the body to retain potassium, my eating  potassium rich foods is apparently a negative which doesn't make sense if I'm trying to eat better to lower my blood pressure.  I now see why people wind up taking these meds for the rest of  their lives.  I'm going to stop taking it because of this effect on me.",Ms. Hibplee

I alternate dosages...take twice a day 3 times per week then one a day other 4 days. My blood pressure is 104/72. I want to be able to take it only once a day soon! I believe it will happen. What makes this medicine work for me is that I am active by exercising 6 days per week (weight training and cardio 4 days per wk, 1 day kickboxing and 1 day just walking). I believe that if you get plenty of cardio work for heart/blood circulation it will do what it supposed to do without really experiencing all of the bad side effects. The only side effect I experienced is a slight sore throat once in a while.",Anonymous

It sure worked well in lowering blood pressure but the side effects were a pain in the neck.  I was taking 20/25 mg and was dizzy, headachy, awfully tired all the time, stomach upset, aching all day in my feet so that I could hardly walk, as well as other side effects.  On my own I cut it down in half and feel much better. My blood pressure is still on the low side, but these miserable side effects have finally let up.  Guess I'd better tell the doctor. ",Deezie
58,Hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril,High Blood Pressure,9.0,,"August 20, 2011",82,Was on Toprol for a long time and was having to constantly increase the dosage.  My doctor switched me to this and I immediately noted a great balance of blood pressure.  Went from 145/98 to 127/78 (ish).  Only side effects I have noted are ones that are easily cured with water intake. I get the cough and am lethargic and dizzy when working in the yard (I live in Texas so it's a billion degrees outside).  Both of these however are mitigated with increased water intake.  I drink flavored water throughout the day and these side effects have subsided.  Very happy with this medicine.,Shards

I took it before and then switched medicines because of the coughing side effect of the Lisinopril. The new medicine did not provide the same results so I switched back. I have the cough off and on, sometimes it is pretty strong for a few minutes. It goes away and recently has been minimal. The only other side effect I notice is dizziness or light headedness sometimes. I started taking the pill late morning after eating breakfast. The side effects seem to be much better for the most part.",5150

It went from a tickle to downright chest discomfort. But for some reason that I can't explain the coughing eased up ( didn't do anything different) to the point where I can tolerate it.
