0,Toprol XL,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 30, 2021",4,"DON'T TAKE THIS POISON !!!  I was on it only 2 months. Weaned off as directed after experiencing horrible side effects (fatigue, shortness of breath, bloating/gassy, weight gain, joint pain, limb swelling, facial swelling)  and went through absolute nightmare getting off of this drug I had severe panic attacks, anxiety attacks, depression, insomnia, ARRHYTHMIA, vagus nerve disfunction, chest vibrations.  It has been 8 months since I discontinued this awful drug and the arrhythmia continues on a regular basis. I never had any palps or arrhythmias ever in my life until I took Toprol and now its a daily problem. I fully regret ever taking Toprol. It was nothing but bad from the very first pill.....",Scarlet
1,Toprol XL,High Blood Pressure,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 24, 2021",1,"I'm on 400 mg a day.  I have  vision problems.  There's a black half moon shape in 1 eye, sometimes bright colors, I  have nausea and fatigue every day, and depression.  I  can't stop, as its for a previous aortic aneurysm.  Just feel miserable and like I've got the flu every day.",Pam S.
2,Toprol XL,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 5, 2021",50,"I was on Toprol Xl and experienced many of the 41 side effects listed from the website but not included with warning label.  I experienced nausea, diarrhea, heartburn, dry mouth, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, lightheadedness, cold feet & hands, shortness of breath, wheezing, fluttering heartbeat, shortness of breath w mild exertion, dizziness, loss of appetite. I went to the doctor & ER several times fearing a heart attack but was found to be in good health. No one knew what was wrong until I researched & found all my symptoms under this medication. I stopped 2 days ago & blood pressure is now normal and most symptoms have gone away and improving. It takes about 7 days to feel normal per the website. I will NEVER take this medication again. Be careful, the side effects mimic other potential health issues. See your Doctor and seriously look up side effects of Toprol XL.  A very nasty medication!",DebbieGR
3,Toprol XL,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 15, 2021",148,"Was on Toprol XR for only 6 weeks and had to get off of it quickly. HORRIBLE anxiety/panic attacks, constant arrhythmia, tachycardia, passing out, hypoglycemia, hallucinations, nightmares, Raynaud's syndrome, etc. This drug almost finished me off. I had 13 severe panic attacks since starting it; and if I wasn't as healthy a person as I am, I am certain it would have given me a heart attack. I am now exactly 8 weeks off of it. Most of the horrible symptoms have stopped, except the arrhythmia that comes and goes. In my opinion, Toprol is a serious endocrine disrupter and should be pulled from the market. It is a very dangerous drug. Can't believe how sick I became after starting it. Screw all pills. I can control my BP with diet. I truly regret ever putting one of these poisonous pills in my mouth.",VinnieB
4,Toprol XL,High Blood Pressure,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 3, 2021",11,"My husband has been on Toprol XL for over a year. Started on 100mg for very high BP. Also on Atacand 4mg for mild left heart Failure. Now reduced to 50 mg alternate days. Side effects, Severe Peyronie's disease and loss of libido. Fullness in stomach and loss of appetite. Various aches and pains, swelling in hands and others random areas. Seems to get a rebound effect of breathlessness or its just a side effect. BP is  good in low 120/65. May try cutting in half to 25mg a day. Dr prescribed a different Beta Blocker that has worse side effects so he hasn't filled that out. Also its only available as Generic which from his experience with Metaprolol it was worse. He gets the brand Drugs through Canada.",Thecaregiver
5,Toprol XL,High Blood Pressure,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 9, 2019",28,Taken for 4 yrs on low dose 25 mg. It helps but my heart rate stays low and after taking it I feel dizzy and short of breath. My bp was borderline high and my Dr prescribed it at 100 mg daily which was unbelievable.

8,Toprol XL,High Blood Pressure,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 7, 2017",60,"I had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) in March 17. I'm a  53 yo male.  Always had higher heart rate and family history of high blood pressure.  I could actually feel the TIA coming on over a few weeks, but I'm a tough guy.   Several drugs tried and failed.  Lisinipril damn near killed me with blood pressure of 175/133.  Read a lot and switched to Toprol XL, no generic!!!!  I  take 50mg at night slow release.  Feel great and few side effects.  Pressures are good and heart rate is down.  Sex still works and anxiety is cut in half.   Good stuff.   Takes a 1-2 week adjustment period.  Relax and let it work.",Deano12
9,Toprol XL,High Blood Pressure,10.0,,"September 16, 2017",49,"I have tried the generic version (extended release) after using brand name Toprol XL.  The generic did not work well for me. After a few days it felt like I hadn't taken the medicine. Toprol XL works great, and when i swapped back to the original I felt great again. There must be some difference in the release between the two. This med brings the BP into 120's over low to mid 70's range where I was reg 140's/90's. It also helps bpm from mid 90's down to upper 70's.",ChristophA

I was having readings as high as 165/106. My doctor prescribed me this, 25MG once before I go to bed every night. I was on this for about two weeks before I started noticing a lot of hair falling out. Thank God she took me off before it got too noticeable, but other than this side affect I feel it was a pretty decent medication, it definitely lowered my blood pressure.",Kayla Nevins

I took it on myself to reduce my dosage of TOPROL XL cutting it in half because my pressure was checking much lower and I did so for about two week prior to a Doctors appointment keeping a record of checks three to four times a day and gave it to my Dr. and he ran a EKG, then reduced my dosage in half and I'm checking out fine at around 120/70/67 so suggest check your salt intake.",rough & ready

Saw my Doc and after an EKG and a slightly elevated blood pressure was put on 25mg which went to 100mg over a period of 3 yrs. Kept BP at home and was fine. Every time at the Doctor's it was like 150/90 never understood this. Last time was placed on Lisinopril, this kicked my butt, dizziness, ear ringing, dry cough. Said heck with it and found a Cardiologist. He took me off the Ace Inhibitor and put me on Norvasc 10mg, will see how it works.",Anonymous
19,Toprol XL,High Blood Pressure,5.0,,"October 23, 2011",67,"I started taking this medicine in 2006. It works to take the pressure off my heart but it has caused me arthritis in my knees, hands and feet.  Now I am in pain most of the time.  My hands have developed arthritis in both thumbs, my feet have it in my toes.  I tried another Astra Zeneca product called Atacand and it works better but is so expensive I can't afford to buy it.",Anonymous
20,Toprol XL,High Blood Pressure,10.0,,"January 13, 2011",61,Before I started Toprol XL I had migraines everyday for a year I had no idea that I had high blood pressure and it wasn't really high it was borderline. Anyway I started taking the Toprol and my migraines decreased and the palpitations seemed to stop after about a month. I ended up only taking Toprol for 8 months and I had no more migraines or palpitations and of course my blood pressure was under control. It stayed that way for about a year and a half until I became pregnant and that seemed to trigger it all back. But I did the same thing and am fine now and I never experienced any side effects.,Anonymous

24,Toprol XL,High Blood Pressure,2.0,,"January 2, 2010",85,"I have not liked this medication at all.  I was taking 25 mg of Hydrochlorothiazide, which worked great to reduce and maintain my blood pressure, but a side effect was frequent urination, and as a teacher, that was a slight nuisance.  However, with generic Toprol, I have not gotten a decent night's sleep, and my blood pressure went higher (although I halved the 25 mg pill due to the side effects).  I also feel anxious and unsettled. ",Anonymous
25,Toprol XL,High Blood Pressure,3.0,,"November 18, 2009",54,"I have had many problems (one being that it took me a lot of time for my body to get used to it) with this product. The worst side effect has been the onset of diabetes which this product is responsible for.  The question I had of my cardiologist is why in the world would he prescribe it to a high risk candidate like me -- I am Hispanic, in my 50s when it was prescribed.  I informed my PA of this after my last crisis and she is looking into prescribing a different product (one given at the hospital) but this after a few years on Toprol.  I figure that without the change from this medicine I don't stand a chance of reversing my diabetic condition.",Anonymous
