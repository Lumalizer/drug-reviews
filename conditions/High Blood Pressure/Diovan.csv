1,Diovan,High Blood Pressure,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 19, 2021",3,"160 mg after I wake up and 160 mg before I go to sleep. Also, taking rilmenidine 1 mg in the evening. My blood pressure is always from 120 to 140. Diovan (valsartan) saved me for real. I tried zofenopril, captopril, quinapril, got me dermatitis, tried amlodipine, nifedipine, felodipine, lercanidipine, my heart was like a ticking bomb. I can only take *sartan medicine and *nidine central nervous system anti hypertensive agents. So I chose Diovan (valsartan). The doctors also tried olmesartan and irbesartan on me, but, valsartan seemed the best for me. For my angina, I take metoprolol tartrate 50 mg after I wake up.",carmencocis

4,Diovan,High Blood Pressure,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 22, 2018",61,I just experienced sudden onset high blood pressure.  I'm almost 50.  Never had problems before.  My normal BP is about 115/70.  2 weeks ago for unknown reasons it spiked up to 210/125.  Stayed in that range for full 2 weeks.  Dr. Put me on amlodipine for 10 days.  It did absolutely nothing.  Just changed med to Dioval HCT.  After 1 pill BP came down to 125/80.  After next pill it's down to 112/69.  Crazy how fast it worked.  I'm almost afraid to take pill #3 because I'm hoping it won't go too low.  Is this normal?,Jewls

I went on vacation to palm desert and wasn't watching my sodium intake and not keeping hydrated.  I paid dearly by watching my blood pressure go from 140/90 to 180/105 and ended up at urgent care.  Doc gave me Diazide to flush out the sodium and now my blood pressure is 110/70 and cardiologist decreased Diazide to 40mg.  Some of Diovan's side effects are dissipating with this reduction.
