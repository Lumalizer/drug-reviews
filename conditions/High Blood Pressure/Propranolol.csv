My doc never checks before prescribing me anything, then acts surprised when I return with terrible side effects.   Not sure if I can stay on this med for long, but it is the only one so far that has actually helped lower my blood pressure, none of the other meds I've been prescribed have helped at all.",Mrmachinist

4,Propranolol,High Blood Pressure,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 7, 2021",1,"Prescribed for high blood pressure. I’m African American (which does matter) and was prescribed 40mg twice a day. It caused me to have anxiety attacks- bad ones!! I ended up in the ER twice for pressure numbers being way higher than I’ve ever experienced. I dealt with constipation, no appetite, insomnia, and no sexual desire. This was after 5 days of use!!! Exercising would cause a panic/anxiety attack. Even taking a shower caused me to have one. I’ve lost 5 pounds in 5 days while on this. I’m done with this medicine as of last night. This morning, I feel A LOT better!!! I made my doctor put me on hydrochlorthiazide for my blood pressure and I took CLONAZEPAM for my anxiety attack that I had yesterday once the propranolol was coming out of my system. I started hydrochlorthiazide yesterday for my blood pressure. This morning, I’m at 129/79 with a pulse of 72.",Charlene

8,Propranolol,High Blood Pressure,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 21, 2021",0,I’ve been on this for close to three weeks. I’m on a low dosage like the 10mg twice a day. I also have hypothyroidism which I’ve had for close to 7 years. Apparently I’ve developed high blood pressure and went to the doctor for a squeezing pain in my left arm and when I did cardio my legs felt like they were unthawing from frost bite so he put me on this medication. I honestly don’t know how to feel about it other than I’m so tired all the time and have zero energy but keep in mind my thyroid is also messed up. I can feel a huge difference in how tired I am. When I tried to wean myself off it it’s making it worse. Don’t know if it’s truly helping or if I should change my medicine. I’m 29 years old have a personal trainer and I’m very active so I’m praying that I can get off this medicine soon.,Britt
9,Propranolol,High Blood Pressure,2.0,,"February 12, 2021",7,Was given this to help lower heart rate when they had me on nifedipine for high blood pressure. I've taken it for a month and asked to be weaned off. Last night of meds I noticed shortness of breath and chest pain. My cardiologist wants me to start taking it again says it is all anxiety.  Awful to be on a beta blocker wish they never gave it to me. So here it is to day 5 of feeling the shortness of breath and chest pain.,Anonymous

Other side effects I've been having is chest pain, slight memory loss, sure it helps to lower your blood pressure, no anxiety anymore, but the side effects are NOT worth it. It also gets rid of your sex drive also, no sexual desire at all. Plus my hands and feet are almost always cold, and extreme irritation.

I've been on it for about a month and my BP is now 90s/60s. I'm on the lowest dose so I might need to go off of it if my BP pressure goes too low. It also helps immensely with anxiety! Side effects are poor circulation (makes raynauds worse), fatigue, and nausea when you first start taking it. The nausea does go away after about a week. Overall, it's a good medication and works well!",Anonymous

I'm trying to get it to where I take it at night so I won't be so tired during the day. That's when you're supposed to take the Extended release.

16,Propranolol,High Blood Pressure,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 25, 2019",22,"Hi, I've been taking Propranolol for a few weeks and I have to say that it did get rid of the headaches that came along with my high blood pressure. Also, my BP did go down. I was pre-hypertension at 130/110. After a week I started to notice that I am constantly nauseous and tired. I have been wiped of all energy and beginning to have insomnia worse than usual. When I do fall asleep, I have these odd dreams that cause me to wake up after only a few hours of sleep. Once I wake from the nightmares, I am sweating profusely and it is uncomfortable. I also noticed that my heart rate slowed a bit to 65bpm resting, not sure if that's bad or not.

17,Propranolol,High Blood Pressure,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 18, 2019",27,"I am prescribed to take a 10 mg tablet 3 times a day along with another bp medication as well. I have been on this medication for 2 days thus far to help with my high blood pressure and fast heartbeat. I do feel a bit calmer, my blood pressure is doing a bit better than before I started it, and my pulse rate is slowly coming down. My biggest issues with this medication are basically the same with every blood pressure (BP) med I've ever taken before: fatigue, dizziness, makes me get hot, it messes with my appetite, and it makes me really nauseated after taking it. I have absolutely no idea why, BP meds come with such a large amount of side effects, and it's like when are they ever going to go away. I am going to continue to stay on it for now, but the side effects are a real downer for sure. It's a shame how a lot of these medications are just poisoning us anyways.",Prettichic
18,Propranolol,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 11, 2019",39,"I’ve been on propranolol for high BP for almost a year, does it work yes. However it comes with a hefty price tag and that being your overall well being. I slipped into a depression from it when I tried coming off it my heart rate rocketed to 95 beats a minute from 65 sitting still. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. Scared to death I went back up to my normal dose. I don’t have any feeling inside towards people my wife or anything. I’m completely dead inside thanks to this but hey guess I’m alive so that’s a bonus. No interest in sex or anything that used to make me happy. I have no pre existing conditions that would of caused depression and was a happy person before taking it. Upside is that having no emotion you really don’t care about anything so no stress or anxiety. My suggestion is that when you talk to your doctor ask them if they would give this to their kids. That should help you make a decision as to whether or not it’s worth the price. Good luck people and heed my advice.",Skylar7
