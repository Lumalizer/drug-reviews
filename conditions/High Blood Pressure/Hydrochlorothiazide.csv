Went to ER twice because it went up over 165.  My doctor prescribed me thiazide 26mg because I have side effects with Lisinopril 5mg.  I got low potassium 2.9 after I was taking thiazide for two weeks.   My potassium was normal before I started taking thiazide.

2,Hydrochlorothiazide,High Blood Pressure,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 8, 2022",3,"My doctor put me on this drug starting with 12.5mg/day when my blood pressure was consistently in the low 140's/75 approx. 8-10 years ago.  It knocked the 140 down to 135 on average.  As I aged, my bp crept back up to the 140's again, so the doc increased my dose to 25mg/day approx. 2 years ago.  Again, I am down in the 135/75 area.  My new doctor thinks I should consider taking something different to reduce my top number even more, but I'm hesitant to do so.  I take it first thing in the morning only and have no side affects or other problems.  It supposedly makes you pee more and should not be taken at night for that reason; I have not noticed any increase of urination by taking it in the morning.  I drink 6-8 cups of coffee in the morning, so the drug's affects might be masked by the volume of coffee I drink(?).  If my average bp creeps back up in the coming years, I may need to consider another drug.  My present doctor doesn't like adding another drug to hydrochlorothiazide.",Works ok.
3,Hydrochlorothiazide,High Blood Pressure,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 6, 2022",0,"I've been on Losartan and HCTZ for a few years now. I've had mixed experiences and after some research I think it has to do with the manufacturer.  The same generic drug can be produced by several different companies. for Example I had losartan from Aurobindo and had no issues. I changed pharmacies and was given Losartan from Camber which was awful. went back to Aurobindo and problems went away. My HCTZ is from Leading Pharmaceuticals. I am currently on a Losartan-HCTZ combo pill from Lupin Pharmaceuticals and have no issues.Can you all post which manufacturer you were given? the pill will have letters and numbers on it you can google. or just post the Letters/Numbers.I am willing to bet the wide range of experiences can be at least partially link to the manufacturer. If we all post, we might just find that there is a manufacturer to avoid just like Camber Pharmaceuticals.",Londawg

However, after 1 year and a half, I began having dizzy spells. About a month after these started, I landed in the emergency room when my heart rate shot through the roof. While teaching my heart suddenly began racing and I thought I was about to blackout. I was rushed to the emergency room where it was found that my potassium was so low, it was affecting my heart. I was immediately taken off hydrochlorothiazide and given Potassium for a couple of days. Once off the drug, my arrhythmia attacks lessened and then completely stopped after about 2 months.

I had a situation where I had to go to the ER because my blood pressure went up. I was prescribed the HTZ to bring it down. I took it for 30 days along with my Lisinopril and my new BP, amlodipine. Recently went to the doctor and all of my vitals were excellent except for one, a1c! I am convinced that this water pill caused my new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes!! I was very angry and I told the doctor that I am not going to take this anymore regardless of whether he sends it to the pharmacist. I came off the med and for three straight days I am not felt any tiredness or any of the side effects once I drop this water pill. Warning, stay away from water pills!

My BP was averaging 140/90, even though I am very active and vegetarian. It reduced my blood pressure, but about one month after I started taking it I began to have frequent nosebleeds that lasted only about 15 seconds. My PA did not discuss side effects. She didn't even discuss lifestyle factors that contribute to high blood pressure. When I told her about the nosebleeds, she said they were probably caused by high blood pressure, so I started checking my BP whenever I had a nose bleed. Needless to say, my BP was under 120/80, so I just stopped taking the HCTZ. Now, my BP is normal. It was likely high as a result of working nightshift and not getting much sleep for the past 5 years. I now have a day-shift job and feel much better. I also have a new doctor. If you take this med, pay attention to your body. Your body might be telling you to stop taking it.",DeeH

Five days after starting the med I had a medical emergency due to critically low sodium and potassium and was hospitalized for 4 days to try and bring my levels back up. My doctor has since added this medication to my list of drugs I can’t take. The hospital doctor tried to convince me that my doctor did not make a mistake by prescribing this for me, but common sense tells me if a patient already has low sodium don’t prescribe a drug that could potentially lower it even more.

I was started on labetalol but my PCP wanted to try out HCTZ instead because he said beta blockers are not a first line drug for high BP. From day one of taking it I had a terrible headache that never went away after 3 weeks of taking it daily. My blood pressure (which was 160/98 prior to any medication) shot up to 172/118 at my last dr visit. In addition to the headaches, I also experienced some brain fog, tiredness, and weakness. I think I may have been severely dehydrated from HCTZ combined with breastfeeding (which also uses a lot of the water in your body), despite drinking water all day long... So this was not a good fit for me at all. I stopped taking it today and started back on the labetalol and my BP is now 142/86.

At first, hydrochlorothiazide helped a little bit, but when you have 158/90 BP, you need more than 5% reduction in it. This medication made me severely dehydrated and caused significant electrolyte loss. I quit it and tried Chlorthalidone, but that again failed - if you only have mild elevated BP, this could be OK; if you have significant hypertension, though, you are much better suited to a real medication, such as a beta blocker.",Katluv

I looked up the side effects and quickly decided that this medication is not anything I want to put in my system especially when one of the side is high blood pressure. All the side effects of this medication are very scary! If I had known I would never had filled this prescription. I am changing my PC because I have lost faith in him and do not believe in his competency to prescribe medication. A patient should learn to look up the side effects of their prescription and see for them self IF what they have been prescribe is right for them.
