0,Metoprolol,High Blood Pressure,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 30, 2022",1,Metoprolol is an excellent beta blocker that fitted my condition. I have used several categories of beta blocker for my high blood pressure but the only effective one was this drug. It is slowly released with excellent efficacy. The only draw back is nightmares as it crosses the blood brain barrier. I am still on it but I have got used to those night mares.,Khaled
1,Metoprolol,High Blood Pressure,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 30, 2022",1,"Metoprolol Succinate ER (metoprolol):I have been on the extended release for 2 months, 25 mg once a day. I love it! I had a blood pressure crisis with non-stop dizziness and BP was 200/100, which happened a week after recovering from COVID. My general doctor put me on this because I also have low potassium (hypokalemia) and a diuretic would make it go even lower. I was already on an ace inhibitor when this happened. The metoprolol dropped my heart rate to about 58, but gradually it has come back up a little to 68 now. I like it because it makes me feel really calm. I haven’t had any of the negative side effects except a little dizziness when getting up quickly. I didn’t gain weight or feel tired, which I was afraid would happen. It just makes me feel very relaxed all over, in a physical way which carries over to also feeling good mentally. 10/10",Amy
2,Metoprolol,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 22, 2022",0,"I was out on Metoprolol for elevated blood pressure after Covid I only took for 9 weeks they tried to up my dose from 25mg to 50 mg  on the third day my blood pressure bottomed out. I had to be taken off abruptly and the rebound symptoms are horrible seems I didn’t need it anymore. My blood sugar dropped a few times and my blood pressure has to be monitored because it drops too low. I also get severe panic attacks out of nowhere and anxiety and nausea. This was a horrible choice for me and I am 21 days off it and the side effects are getting better  each day, only with the help of my Jesus.  I would not recommend this medicine to anyone the withdrawals are crazy….read reviews before you take a medication that crosses the brain barrier…",drake8873

Must say it helped allot. Had social anxiety which has been almost gone away. Sure it takes a few weeks/months to get into it, at the beginning I felt depressed, tired, erectile dysfunction (which is easily treatable with citrulline/Arginine or viagra) and got low blood sugar. Now after almost a year I have mild side effects but are treatable (tiredness) Have tried before: diuretics, ace inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and ARBs and for me beta blockers are the best since the other medications had far worse side effects.Something I have to add is I might have POTS (self diagnosed) and maybe it’s why it works so well for me.

They ran tests and I was fine, a while later I began waking up with a racing heart 140's. For a few days I believe it was just stress, but my doc changed my meds to Metoprolol. I've been on it for 10 years, at one point I lost 30lbs and it made my BP too low so I was taken off it for a year then got into a stressful situation and vitals back up so they put me back on. I never had any issues with this pill it keeps my BP normal and sometimes low and my heart rate is always low/normal. Somedays it gets too low in the low 60s and I'll get up and jump around lol I know that's not bad but for me I don't like it that low.

I went to the clinic because I was feeling bad and when they took my blood pressure it was high but it was because I had COVID but on September I went back because I had an eye infection, when they took my blood pressure, again it was high so I went with a different doctor and she prescribed lisinopril which after taking it 6 days gave me tachycardia so she told me to stop it and then she prescribed me metoprolol oh my goodness I took it for 4 days and it’s been the worst, I started feeling dizzy and my pulse was getting really low so talking to a doctor he told me to stop taking it however it’s been a month since that and I still feel dizzy and my pulse is still low specially at night, it goes down to 48 sometimes and I’m scared..worst thing or best depending how you see it is that my blood pressure is normal!

12,Metoprolol,High Blood Pressure,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 20, 2021",0,I started on metoprolol 25mg twice per day about 3 years ago for high BP and chest pain. In the past month I have started getting PVC and chest pain along with very low blood pressure averaging around 95/65 and when I lay down it goes even lower I stay so sleepy and can feel the flutters. It's very scary. My cardio Dr is doing a bunch of test on me but I wish he would figure this out quickly it's causing me severe anxiety. I'm so worried that now I have diminished cardiac output. It's got me afraid to go to sleep. I was wondering is there a better med other than metoprolol for PVC that won't drop my bp so low? I clearly don't need my bp going any lower.,Jbrock13
13,Metoprolol,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 5, 2021",0,I had taken Metoprolol for months and noticed it wasn’t doing as good a job at blood pressure control as Bystolic and then as I increased the dosage to compensate the side effects started. The anxiety was unreal! I had been treated for afib and soon after Cryoblation the afib was back. I really think after reading these reviews that the Metoprolol is to blame. I have been off of it now 2 days and am back on Bystolic and still have some anxiety and palpitations but they seem to be slowly subsiding. Don’t use this blood pressure medication if want to keep your sanity. I also want to note that I had extreme trouble sleeping while on Metoprolol. I’m never trying any other beta blocker but Bystolic.,Curtis J
14,Metoprolol,High Blood Pressure,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 4, 2021",0,"I have been on Metropolol for about two years now.This drug is giving me awful side effects and I am only on 25mg a day. The two worse side effects for me is tiredness and bile puke up at night. I had forgotten to take this med a few times and I knew it because the night puke ups was better. I cut my dosage in half and told my doctor that I have night time puke ups. He put me back on the full 25mg dosage. When I told him I was having difficulty taking this med, the Dr. told me to take it anyway. He can say that, it’s not him having the puke ups at night. I went down to a half dose again. I can’t stand getting dizzy at times, the tiredness, heartburn. I am sensitive to meds I know but I can’t imagine taking a higher dose of this medication. I would like to get off it all together. I even tried taking Metropolol in the morning hoping that the side effects would wear off ,but it didn’t matter when I took it. It did lower my blood pressure a little, so that is why I am still on a half dose",Geeters

After I start Metoprolol, 2 month later I've noted that my pulse is going down occasionally. Didn't give me much to think up until July when I start to nearly lose my conscience. 3 weeks of nightmare, my blood pressure was very low but my pulse was 50. Once I've been taking by the ambulance. At some point my doctor told me to stop taking it ,which I did. And my pulse is back to normal now.I  have panic attacks instead. 3 weeks now without Metoprolol and I'm getting worse.

I lost 20 pounds but I kept feeling worse and worse, barely able to function and extremely depressed.  One day I started checking my blood pressure later in the day instead of in the morning and was shocked to see it was dropping to 90/50 and pulse 50 which is when I was having episodes like I was going to pass out.  Finally, after seeing my doctor I've gradually cut down to a quarter pill (12.5mg) which I'm also afraid to completely stop even though my bp is very low to normal all of the time.  I'm sure this pill helps people and wouldn't want to interfere with anyones meds but getting off of this is brutal.

I asked the pharmacist if I could request this brand of generic. She said they generally get whatever is available. So for the past year my numbers have been up above 140/90. Even tried the brand-Toprol XR and didn’t see lower numbers.The last couple of weeks my numbers have been down  again. Sure enough I just looked up what generic I am on and it is zydus.,Best generic

My doctor asked me if I wanted to switch, I said no, I take it with food now. I get extremely tired on it. When I take my doctor visits I feel slow, calm but just tired and slow.  I've had a bit of a cough on it to say I think yes it does affect the lungs. I live with anxiety and  it calms down on this, I sleep a lot and I have some very wild dreams on it.
