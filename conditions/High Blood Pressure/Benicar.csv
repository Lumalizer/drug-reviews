0,Benicar,High Blood Pressure,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 12, 2021",1,"I have taking Benicar  HCTZ 40-25 FOR 15YRS The name has changed to the generic Olmesartan I wasn't happy with the name change because I don't know if it's the same medication, I assume it is. I've been taken Benicar along with Atenolol 100mg and those two combinations work great together, I never have or had any problems with this medication. I also don't have migraines like I use to. I have no complaints or problems with the medication, I actually like it, my Dr 15yrs ago put me on it and said this is what he prescribes his patients and if it's good enough for my Dr's parents it's good enough for me. No complaints. I see some of these reviews states they have feet pain, but if these people are diabetes the feet and muscle pain could come from neuropathy. My ins won't cover it.",Benicar HCTZ 40-25
1,Benicar,High Blood Pressure,10.0,,"April 20, 2021",49,"Been on 20mg Benicar for decade (I am 72). Works great.  Took  cheaper generic made by Glenmark & developed bronchitis..   Do your research when switching to any generic. Look to see if there’s an authorized generic. If not, ask about other pharmaceutical companies that make generic. These companies can add fillers to the brand formula.  CVS Caremark  gave me three more suppliers they could get a generic from. An internet search for generic Olmesartan Medoximil (Benicar) along with the manufacturing company gave the ingredients used to compare to the Benicar-Brand produced by Sankyo. Accord Pharmaceuticals’  list of ingredients looks identical to Sankyo’s Brand Benicar. I’m hoping the Accord generic will work like Brand Benicar, as Accord cost is about $13/month. Much better than $2K for Sankyo-produced brand Benicar.  Hope this info helps.",baybrooke

3,Benicar,High Blood Pressure,10.0,,"October 21, 2020",94,"I am not overweight at all yet still developed HT at 50 years old.   I tried the gamut of BP meds all producing the desired results but all having the same varying side effects most often a dry cough.  Then I tried Benicar 20mg.  It lowered my BP, but, I was extremely lethargic.  Started to take it at night but then couldn't get up in the morning.  I cut my tablets into quarters and started taking 5mg instead of 20mg.  My BP remained fine at 5mg and I stayed at that does for 12 years without any side effects.  At 66 years old I switched to a vegetarian diet and within half a year my BP began to drop too low.  I reduced my dosage to 5mg every-other-day and my BP was still too low.  I stopped taking Benicar altogether and have not found it necessary to go back on it for nearly 18 months now.  I'm still learning to eat vegetarian and make things taste good but very pleased that I have been able to control HT through diet.

Awful head fullness in morning, migraines, steady headache most of the day, lower leg pain, not able to sleep, and then filling like my ears are blocked and was treated for middle ear infection several times due to constant ear pain and vertigo, dizziness. Very blurry vision, floaters Finally started looking at all my medications and found that when I moved Benicar to later in day, the nausea, dizziness and fatigue occurred within an hour of taking. It did great at lowering my bp, but side effects are awful! After discussion with doctor and safe Losartan again available I am switching back. This drug is just not for me.

It puts me to sleep, however after 4 straight nights of it I wake up so drained have no energy and feel a little confused. I too have breathing problems but assumed my asthma was getting worse.
