1,Telmisartan,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 9, 2022",0,"8 days ago I was put on 40 mg to start and just a few hours after taking the first dose, I started to feel awful. Strange sensation in my mouth, crippling malaise/lethargy, disturbed sleep patterns.It destroyed my daily life. The doctor that prescribed it, told me to stop immediately after I mentioned the symptoms, and after 36 hours I'm starting to feel better. That was a hard lesson to get back on the exercise bike and walk more.I know BP meds are tricky and each patient reacts differently, so I cannot say this is a bad choice for all but be wary and don't be afraid to tell your doc it is not working or is not tolerable.",Tunnsie

It works - but I do experience side effects of being unsteady when I walk; and periodically (every 4-5 years) I need to change meds for 90-180 days because ankles swell. My Dr and I return to telmisartan because of it's overall effectiveness and kidney protection, but the swelling pattern is consistent having now occurred 3-4 times with discontinuing use for a while resolving the swelling.",SassySenior
4,Telmisartan,High Blood Pressure,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 28, 2021",1,Cardiologist started me at 80mg dose which lowered my blood pressure but dizziness and vertigo were so bad it was not worth it. Did some research on herbs and found old garlic extract that people raved about with similar conditions. I take 1000mg tablet each day. I reduced my telmisartan to 40mg. recently along with my garlic. Vertigo has decreased  considerably. I am planning on going off telmisartan shortly to see if I can maintain a 129/69 with just the garlic tablets.,pablo75

On only 20mg daily, mine went down to 95/65 pretty consistently.  However, it made me so tired that I couldn't function.  Sleeping 10-12 hours a day and exhausted when awake.  Took myself off and I'm at 130/75, and feel like myself again.  I know he's not going to be happy, but what good is supposedly prolonging your life when you're too tired to enjoy it?

I was running about 180 /120. After she told me that she'd seen 400 lb men with better numbers than that I decided to see my MD. I've been on Micardis almost 30 days and it seems to have lowered it to the 140/90 range. I also was put on Bystolic just 5 days ago due to a rapid pulse of 100 bpm. Now down to 75-80.

My doctor said the drug also helped prevent cardiovascular disease. The initial 40mg went well without any side effects. Blood pressure was consistently 130-140/80-90. A few months ago when I turned 38, during my routine blood pressure checks, I noticed that it was 140-150/90-100 even with the 40mg pill. Monitored this for about 2 weeks and it remained thereabouts. After consulting my doctor, he recommended a higher dosage of 80mg. It worked, and the pressure stabilized at 70-90/120-140.
