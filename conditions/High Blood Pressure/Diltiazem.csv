3,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2022",3,"A horrible drug. I was prescribed the generic adizem-xl 120mg and what a bad experience it turned out to be! After a week or 2 I had huge pressure on the right side of my chest which felt almost like my right lung was blocking up, as I could hardly breathe with exertion. Another side effect I encountered was frequent sharp stabbing pains when used with losartan again down the right side of my chest which lead me to A&E, only for them to say everything's fine. After a lot of hassle my GP finally agreed to change my medication although the problems didn't stop there!",barrycard
4,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 20, 2021",1,"I was given Metoprolol Succinate, Eloquis, and Atorvastatin after being admitted to the hospital with a-fib. I am a healthy 42 year old, non smoker male. The metoprolol is the worst medicine I have ever taken. I suffered for about two months with horrible side effects. Went back to ER because I thought I was having a heart attack about a week after starting meds. Stomach pain, dizziness, depression, anxiety, increased BP, shakes, bloated feeling, tiredness, and sharp pains in chest. After about two months another cardiologist told me to stop taking the metoprolol and switch to diltiazem ER 120mg once a day. It took about a week but all the side effects stopped. I started feeling like a human being again. I had muscle twitches for a week as my body flushed the metoprolol. Diltiazem has been a God send for me but obviously not for others.

13,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,,,"November 27, 2020",8,"Diltiazem Hydrochloride XR (diltiazem):My mother was in and  out of the ER for high BP. The situation was a nightmare. She was on Diovon and that gave her kidney stones 5x until they figured out it was her medication. The gave her Allopurinol. This is a horrible drug and used for gout and stops kidney stones from forming. Oh, did I mention the aspirin for 10 years that gave her ulcers.  As a result, of the Allopurinol we now have Acid Reflux. Please be aware that acid reflux will effect you BP! They gave her so many over the counter and prescription antacids that did not work. She is taking liquid form of Maalox 15 min before eating and bedtime. Oh what a relief! The BP came down and and she now stable. Please watch for BP meds with water pills as kidney stones can form. Check to see if you really need aspirin everyday, and stay away from Allopurinol unless you have gout and need it. I think preventative drugs sometimes do more harm than good. We are trying to figure out if she should stay on avapro or diltiazem",Helpfull

18,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 12, 2019",17,"I took this drug diltiazem for about 10 days- it was working well until day 6- when it started to tighten my stomach and cause a feeling of bloating and constipation. Just in time for a 4 hour plane flight too! Not comfortable. I had to quit taking it due to this feeling- I've had 5 stomach surgeries due to ruptured appendix complications, so being bloated and constipated isn't especially fun for me. Too bad since the drug otherwise was working well- I had improved energy and could stay awake longer than with the beta blocker I had been on, and my sex drive had returned also!  So quitting it was disappointing- I have so many bad side effects to many of these BP drugs.  So back on the Bisoprolol I go, even though I feel like a 90 year old man on it & basically castrated!  May get my doc to prescribe Diovan for me next month, unless he has a remedy for this stomach tightness/bloating that Diltiazem had given me.",BPdrugMadness

I am constantly dizzy/lightheaded and feeling slightly sick to my stomach. As I have a daily 60 mile round-trip commute to and from work, that's scary. It also appears to be affecting my depth perception. ",Marcia64
53,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 29, 2013",57,Diltiazem for High Blood Pressure: Atrial Fibrillation: Atrial Flutter I took Diltiazem before surgery and then continued it after for high blood pressure.  It worked just fine for a while although the 12 hr only lasted for 4- 5 hours in my case. Then I started getting toothaches and really bad gingivitis. I did have gingivitis already. I also started feeling lousy and only by coincidence did I stop taking the Diltiazem. Two day later my toothaches were gone and my gums stated clearing up. I still thought it was a coincidence. I restarted Diltiazem again and the same thing happened again.,stephanieho

62,Diltiazem,High Blood Pressure,10.0,,"September 4, 2009",35,"After my cardiologist tried me on many different combinations of Blood Pressure medications over a period of 3 years, Diltiazem worked perfectly. I'm on the maximum dosage allowed, but take it twice a day in different dosages.  With Hyzaar 100/12.5 at breakfast, I take 240 mg of Diltiazem.  With dinner, I take 300 mg of Diltiazem.  I have had no side effects that I'm aware of.  Incidentally, when I was put on Diltiazem, I was taken off Toprol XL and I felt so much better after Toprol was out of my system.  I had no idea it was affecting me adversely until I was off it.  I saw on the review of Toprol that for as many people who said they tolerated it well, there were an equal amount of others who had bad reactions to it.",allel33
