0,Losartan,High Blood Pressure,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 20, 2022",1,"I suffered an aortic dissection in October 2021.  It is controlled by keeping my bp and heart rate low.  Nothing has worked,  beta blockers made my heart race and caused severe GERD.  Amlodipine gave me palpitations,  lisinopril made me cough, HCTZ caused severe dizziness and high heart rate.   I started on losartan 50 mg then increased to 100mg.  It has been the only BP med I’ve been able to tolerate.  No side effects at all.   I’ve been on it 3 months.   My BP is better, not quite where it should be yet, but much better.",LA Smith
1,Losartan,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 19, 2022",0,"Started taking Losartan, 20mg about a year ago.  No side effects, but my BP was not going down, hovering around 146/85.  Cardiologist raised dosage to 100mg.  After two months I experienced severe vertigo, lightheadedness, weakness in legs and arms, nausea.  Went to GP and he thought it might be meniere's disease, but that was ruled out by my ENT who thought it might be an inner ear viral infection.  Nothing they gave me worked until I saw the side effects of Losartan.  Stopped taking it and symptoms started easing up within a few days.  Still experiencing days of lightheadedness, but it is gradually getting better.  Cardiologist took me off all BP meds and BP has remained around 130/82 for three weeks.  More tests with a neurologist if symptom continue.",Guardian68

When I rolled over in bed it was like being jabbed with a nail. Scans showed that I had developed a gynoclamastia (fatty tissue) in my right breast.  It required surgery to remove.  On my first night of the surgery, as I was sitting in bed, I simply googled what causes gynoclamastia and the first 10 search results showed it was related to Losartan.  Apparently 23% of men will develop gynoclamastia from taking Losartan.",Muvucker

I'm not taking it anymore.  I would rather just die than to feel this way. I have zero faith in doctor's and this adds to the reasons.  I went in for suspected high blood pressure and not one word about exercise, eating right, meditation, nothing at all ..simply wrote a script and off I went.

First thing noticed was the anxious feeling, then loose stools, blurring of vision and  then followed by lethargy and a slow weight gain.

I'm on 100mg per day of Losartan and 10mg of Amlodipine.  These have been fantastic in bringing my BP down to safe and normal levels, however I've always had a slight fuzziness or fogginess in my head.  It's a feeling like I'm not 100% alert.   Recently this has gotten worse and I'm having periods of feeling dizzy, vertigo feelings and focusing issues.  Often feel like my eyes are straining and my forehead and scalp feel tight.  I've also noticed I don't take in information so well.  Not so much memory loss, more like a foggy and lazy brain.

My blood pressure was still pretty high so my doc prescribed Felodipine 2.5 mg to take along with it about a month ago.  My bp came down just slightly.. but definitely not enough to be considered in normal range..(170/90's)...I took it upon myself to cut the dose of Losartan down (taking half the pill)...since I've done this my pressures have been in a very safe range.

He recommended to begin immediately with half a pill of 25 mg losartan. I took my blood pressure 2 hours after the first dose and found 150-80I took the second dose of 12.5 mg after 12 hours and measured my pressure after 24 hours and I got result of 120-60,I believe that I was stressed and anxious when I visited the doctor and that was the reason for momentaneous high blood pressure. I am going to interrupt the treatment and check my blood  pressures next week, in case that  I get into a situation of high stress and anxiety with my blood pressure going above 200. I will take the minimum dose 12.5 mg until it comes down to normal. It might be enough with a couple of doses like today.My question is if this is correct or the withdrawal might carry side effects.

I've had migraines for years and it has actually reduced my chronic headaches and has helped me sleep. I take mine in the morning. If I take it at night it seems to make me not sleep as well.

It seems to amplify an emotional response to any negative thoughts and gets you to fear those questions.I have found that changing my schedule for taking the medication also changes the schedule of the anxiety.  Ie it follows the taking of the drug by about 3 hours (which is when the drug peaks apparently).There is no doubt that anxiety and feelings of negative well being are side effects.

Continued to take it and sometime last year I end up with cancer in my small intestine out of the blue. I had a CT scan earlier in the year of my abdomen area with contrast and there was no tumor there. Well when they did a colonoscopy, the doctor thought where it was was really unusual. he sent biopsies to pathology and it came back as a cancer. I was taken of losartan and put on Micardis a older med that similar to the losartan. I went thru a colectomy and chemo so yes I am definitely looking into this issue. God bless you all.",Believer
