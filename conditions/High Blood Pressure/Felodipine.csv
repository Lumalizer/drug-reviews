0,Felodipine,High Blood Pressure,5,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 7, 2022",0,"Was prescribed Amlodipine  for raised blood pressure. Legs and feet swelled up to the point I had to buy new shoes two sizes larger than normal, my legs were also painful. Doctor changed medication to Felodipine, and to be honest I have not felt well since, suffering from aching limbs, tiredness, lower stomach and back pain, which I am not sure is anything to do with Felodipine but it is strange that the symptoms started after taking this  medication for a few weeks.   It has reduced my blood pressure.",Sidney Gussette
1,Felodipine,High Blood Pressure,3,,"April 22, 2021",14,Started taking this BP drug for only 2 weeks it helped lower my BP but it’s the same without them (white coat syndrome at the docs I am thinking)The side effects were horrible. Trouble breathing constant coughing tinged with blood. Severe aches in and around the kidneys. Feeling listless so today I stopped them and my BP is better than when I was on them. Won’t be taking them or any other BP meds again.  Doctors are far too fast to prescribe medication these days. Without any investigation.,Anonymous

3,Felodipine,High Blood Pressure,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 17, 2021",13,"Was diagnosed with hypertension, which is almost entirely white-coat anxiety, and prescribed felodipine. It is USELESS. Dose was doubled and it was STILL useless. Added an ARB, which worked, even too well (lowest dose lowers my bp too much--because the only place I have hypertension is doctor's office). Then cut back on the felodipine--no increase in the bp.  Going to get off it entirely and stick with the ARB. Felodipine/calcium channel blocker is a placebo for minimal hypertension.  DON't take it. Angiotension-system drugs are far better (but be sure it's an ARB, not an ACE, which causes bad cough in a lot more patients than they claim).",oriflamme
4,Felodipine,High Blood Pressure,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 22, 2018",45,"Was on amlodipine for 2 years. Legs started to tighten terribly and feet swelling so GP put me on felodipine. WOH. Tingling all over body, numbness to the point of dropping cups etc. Headaches rendering me to bed, couldn't lift head off pillows without feeling nausea and dizziness.  Then started coughing up blood. This was all in 3 weeks. Stopped taking it and all returned to normal after 3 days. But unfortunately blood pressure was high again. So now awaiting new medication.",Anonymous

6,Felodipine,High Blood Pressure,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 27, 2015",17,"This medication has brought great relief to my life at 70  yrs.  My peripheral arteries are blocked (legs completely) and completely or partially blocked in other areas, including heart.  I think due to a perinatal cause (my mother suffered meningitis during pregnancy in UK in 1942)  - I have been told that my peripheral arteries are ""spindly"" but the main ones are fine (angiogram).  Blood pressure (systolic) was 200  and I suffered numerous heart attacks and palpitations, prior to use of felodipine.","Judy Tait, NZ"
7,Felodipine,High Blood Pressure,4,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 21, 2012",70,"While this medicine was effective in lowering my blood pressure it had numerous negative side effects.  It made me very sleepy, sensitive to heat, caused my ankles and legs to swell up so I needed a diuretic, it caused acid reflux with or without food, flushing, and made my depression much worse.  I have since weaned off.",Anonymous
8,Felodipine,High Blood Pressure,10,,"July 17, 2009",43,"Plendil (felodipine):Plendil was effective in controlling my blood pressure. The only reason I am not taking it is because I can not purchase this medicine anymore due to the company discontinuing the product. I have had problems finding a substitute for this medicine. If anything is available on the market, I need help.",smit
