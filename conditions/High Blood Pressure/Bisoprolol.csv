0,Bisoprolol,High Blood Pressure,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 31, 2022",0,Been on this for three weeks now. It’s great for keeping my blood pressure normal. Gone through the headaches but now for a week  my body is sore and weak. It’s hard to move about. I will be talking to my doc. I really don’t want to go off because of good blood pressure. I was in the hospital weekly and very scared. I'm on a low dose 2.5 daily.,Trio
1,Bisoprolol,High Blood Pressure,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 27, 2022",0,"I have been taking bisoprolol for three weeks now. It has helped me immensely to bring down my blood pressure, No other medication did this for me. But now I am getting headaches and extremely tired. I am praying this gets better as it has big time disruptions to my daily routine. I also take Candesartan  , and amlodipine. All low doses . I have been on the other two for many years. Bisoprolol keeps me out of the hospital with counts of 180/98 up to 200. Talk about anxiety. I don’t want to stop but really hoping these headaches and tiredness goes away. I am 74 . I rated a 8 because of my new blood pressure. Not so good for the two side effects.",Anonymous

3,Bisoprolol,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 16, 2021",23,A dangerous drug. Its supposed to help with palpitations but actually gave me worse arrhythmias and breathlessness that led me to the ER. It also causes severe anxiety when trying to wean off it. Don't let your doctor prescribe you this rubbish as there are better alternatives out there.,barrycard

13,Bisoprolol,High Blood Pressure,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 18, 2021",24,"Taking bisoprolol 2.5 mg since June 2018 after angioplasty. (along with clopidogrel, aspirin , metformin and lercanidipine.)  Do workout more than 1 hour daily, morning and evening together. Stopped sugar altogether. Feel terribly tired, have issues with peaceful sleep, nocturia, and now serious ED, since recently. BP fluctuates, from 160/90  to 140/70. I feel another BP drug may be tried, I have to discuss seriously with my cardiologist during my next visit .Because of the side effects which affects the quality of life , I am not a fan of Bisoprolol",Dipu
14,Bisoprolol,High Blood Pressure,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 4, 2021",71,"After being on virtually every type of BP drug- or rejecting some immediately like diuretics- this bisoprolol is the only drug I can tolerate. No side effects other than not being able to stay up very late, numerous sleep wake ups thru the night, pretty bad ED and joint/muscle stiffness and arthritis in wrists.  I know this med causes this stiffness/pain since I've went off it a few times and my body felt normal again. I deal with these side effects since they are easier to tolerate than headaches, rapid pulse, constipation/bloating that other types such as ACE, Calcium Channel and ARBs give me. Diuretics and Vasodilators even give me chills and insomnia!  Thus Bisoprolol isn't perfect, but it's way more tolerable than most others.",BPdrugMadness

16,Bisoprolol,High Blood Pressure,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 30, 2020",36,Have been taking Bisoprolol 2.5mg for about a year. Blood pressure reduced - good. Tiredness and fatigue - not so good. Erectile disfunction - awful. Maybe I should stop taking Bisoprolol and live life to the full although unfortunately maybe not a good idea. So to this end it is effective for the treatment needed.,rinkly
17,Bisoprolol,High Blood Pressure,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 19, 2020",81,"Wow...I have no words for how amazing bisoprolol is. I'm a 22 year old male with Severe Anxiety, Panic Disorder, Hypertension and Tachychardia. I was prescribed 2.5mg of Bisoprolol and it didn't bring any significant change to anything, my BP reading was always on 130-150/85-110 never lower than that and my heartbeat rate was always past 80. So I decided to up the dose to 5mg/day, I was shocked that my BP reading was 121/78 today (15 minutes after taking the 5mg dose). Not to mention that my anxiety was reduced too, following my slowed heartbeat rate. This drug is quite the lifesaver, also on another case if you experience any Panic Attack just gulp down 5mg of Bisoprolol and you will be fine and better in 30 minutes. This works so well for me.",Virz

Previously was on Candesartan for many years but it probably contributed to renal function issues so trying these which hopefully will not affect my kidneys. So far, so good. No side effects and BP down to better levels (121/74 pulse 53) so maybe this is the one! Also tried at least 3 other types of medication but all gave me intolerable side effects (swollen ankles, urinary problems).",Wasmynumber

However, started to notice side effects particularly fatigue, shortness of breath, weight gain and some loss of libido.  Tried a 1/2 dosage for a week or so and symptoms dropped a little but not enough for my liking. Also, the blood pressure started to creep up with just a 1/2 dose.

As a side effect (bonus), bisoprolol reduces triglyceride and LDL levels and increases HDL.

29,Bisoprolol,High Blood Pressure,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 29, 2019",43,"Caution--efficacy varies greatly depending on generic manufacturer.  For 15 years I used MYLAN generic. It worked wonderfully at 5mg dose. Then pharmacy switched to Unichem manufacturer--my BP went to over 170/110. Certain it was the Unichem generic because I was able to return to MYLAN and BP reduced again.  Also, to those with palpitations or Right Bundle Branch Block with PVCs your potassium levels may be low. My abnormal ECG completely cured with prescription potassium supplement. Also lowers BP and restores normal sinus rhythm from bradycardia (too slow). Look at your blood test results yourself and compare with normal ranges. Often Doctors only tell you if your results are very far out of range however, even slightly off can cause many symptoms. You are entitled to copies of medical records and good info is available on internet regarding normal ranges.",Cissy
