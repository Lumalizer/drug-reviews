Felt like someone was sitting on my chest, blurred vision, insomnia, extreme fatigue, light sensitivity, no motivation, borderline depression. I had a very bad reaction to it. Both Rx’s took BP from 140/80 to 120/70.  I now sleep 7-8hrs a night, (4-6 on metoprolol). My thinking is clear on Bystolic too; no fog brain. Bystolic is like taking a daily vitamin; I take it and forget it; afterwards feel ok all day and night. Metoprolol was like sitting in an oxygen deprivation tank, fatigued, tired, half knocked out, unable to sleep more than 2 hrs at a time; it was debilitating for me.

Metoprolol made me ill, Diltiazem was ineffective and caused me to hear my heartbeat all day and night long, and Coreg was great at lowering my HR, but inefficient at preventing my palpitations and SVT events. I've been on Bystolic (lowest possible dosage) for 2-3 months and my palpitations/events have drastically been reduced. My HR has gone from 115 resting to about 90, which I am so thankful for. I was hesitant to take this medication because of other patients' reports of headaches, but I take mine before bed and have had no issues. I can't say that I've had any side effects, to be honest.

I used to have had elevated ( 130/98 - 138/99) blood pressure but nothing like this. 5 medication changes since this episode and nothing helped. Finally, a new MD switched me to Bystolic yesterday and within minutes I felt tremendous relief. I even slept the whole night though without pounding heartbeat in my ears, no headache upon waking, for the 1st time since January 26th after the injection experience. It’s been pure anguish for a few months. I still have many tests to go through to find out what caused this. I’m usually very active riding horses, yoga, riding my peleton bike, walking 8 miles a day on the ranches. But all came to a screeching halt since that day.

Did not have that with 2.5 dose.  Going to report to Dr on my next visit in 3 weeks.  I mentioned perhaps taking another beta blocker especially due to the insane cost of this drug, but so far Dr has not mentioned changing drug but did give me 3 month supply.  Primary Dr says she can just give me another beta blocker cheaper but I don't want to go against cardiologist.  I'll see how it goes if things change.",Sis
