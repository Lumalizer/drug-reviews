1,Furosemide,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 26, 2021",10,Lasix (furosemide):I have PMR but I have recently started on Lasix for high blood pressure.

2,Furosemide,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 24, 2020",11,"Lasix (furosemide):This medication was ineffective for me - years ago, I had a mini-stroke, also known as a TIA. At first, this helped a little bit, but when you have 158/90 BP, you need more than 5% reduction in it. This medication made me severely dehydrated and caused significant electrolyte loss. I quit it and tried Chlorthalidone, but that again failed - if you only have mild elevated BP, this could be OK; if you have significant hypertension, though, you are much better suited to a real medication, such as a beta blocker.",Katluv
