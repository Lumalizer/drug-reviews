1,Benazepril,High Blood Pressure,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 15, 2021",5,"Almost one month I'm taking benazepril, have gotten a dry cough here and there, and it stops immediately, nothing I couldn't live with. Now going into forth week, wow, I'm getting chronic pains all over my body almost as if I have arthritis, and worse, It's so paralyzing, headaches too.  I wanted this medication to work because I tried amlodipine and metoprolol and my life was awful with tons of side effects and severe depression. Then I tried olmesartan, didn't have a lot of side effects , but its the chronic body pains , I can't do anything. But I'll  stay with benazepril  for as long as I could to see if it all this side effect goes away, if not I'll have to change again.",Review
2,Benazepril,High Blood Pressure,,,"December 12, 2020",4,Benazepril definitely works to lower BP but also gives you an itchy throat that forces  dry coughs that are not continuous or prolonged about 10-15 coughs a day.,Coolsport
3,Benazepril,High Blood Pressure,1.0,,"September 26, 2020",5,Benazepril did not lower my blood pressure.  My head felt half congested .  My hair was more prone to coming out when combing and did not feel good.  Then the doctor added verampil and I hoped things would be better  but they were not.  I was very very anxious and and had some heart pounding.  I quit taking it.,L

6,Benazepril,High Blood Pressure,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 23, 2017",13,"I have been taking Benazepril, for the last month for reducing hypertension. I have never had problem with high blood pressure in my life. 6' 0' 290 lb. 57 yr. old former football, baseball and soccer player. Coached high school athletics for 32 plus years and now I am taking this medication to control my blood pressure. My side effects have been a roller coaster ride up and down. Fatigue, a dry constant cough, dizziness, light headed and insomnia. See my doctor today, since my introduction to this medication is about over. Hopefully he can change to something better without the side effects. It does control my blood pressure at times but has also lowered my blood pressure to low.",#1Ramfan
7,Benazepril,High Blood Pressure,2.0,,"September 16, 2016",8,"Toxic, garbage medication. Ineffective with side effects. No wonder its what is covered, it must be cheap. You may as well order a Benazepril from China.",minicky

9,Benazepril,High Blood Pressure,7.0,,"January 9, 2016",17,Have taken Lotensin for some years with as-needed dosage adjustments. Pharmacy only had the generic available this last time - Benazepril. l tried to use it a few times before but each time there were too many side effects. So I took Lotensin although expensive less side effects. This time I had no choice the benzaprill has given me a dry cough and the feeling is all my heart is racing ie palpitations I hate it. In the meantime making an appointment to see my doctor so I can go to a pharmacy that has my lotensin in stock.,Grandma in California

12,Benazepril,High Blood Pressure,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 7, 2012",24,"Benazepril for High Blood Pressure: Like the previous user. The medication actually worked great for my blood pressure.  One small pill daily. I developed a cough that would not go away, especially at night. I also have severe asthma so I don't know if that has something to do with the medicine not working out.  The cough is a dry cough and NOT fun.  I wished the medicine worked out for me.",AJR27

16,Benazepril,High Blood Pressure,,,"August 12, 2009",25,I have been taking Benazepril for almost a year.  I have been Pre-Hypertension most of my adult life.  Last year I weighed close to 250 and became Stage 1 hypertension.  My doctor suggested losing 50-60 pounds or take Benazepril.  Give me the medicine....I LIKE TO EAT. Anyway with some exercise and taking benazepril I now weigh 240lbs and my blood pressure is in the high normal range. I'll work on the weight. I do find myself tired at times. This is the only complaint I have. I would recommend this to anyone. ,mick S
