0,Guanfacine,High Blood Pressure,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2022",0,"Tenex (guanfacine):I took 3 mg total over 3 days.  Side effects started immediately.  By day 3, I couldn’t understand speech, I was having trouble with walking, breathing and I was extremely sleepy and very confused.  My vision was changed. I have constant headaches. That was in 2019.  It is now 2022.  With the assistance of a neurologist, I manage symptoms but will be fighting this my whole life. I had to increase my level of care to a neurologist, out of state, at a specialty center.  I wish that I had never taken it.  Obviously, my problems are unique and others will be successful in taking it.",ReaderE
1,Guanfacine,High Blood Pressure,8,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 22, 2020",4,"I use guanfacine (Tenex) in the evening and have been on it for about a year. At first time it gave me hallucinations! I saw a big black spider for several nights (of course I knew it’s not real) this went on for a couple of months I almost wanted to name it my buddy lol.  Anyways, I tried to get off of it and my bp wouldn’t stay normal so I kept it. Now the hallucinations stopped being regular as I got used to taking it. I have had no other problems with it except my insurance won’t pay for it:(",Crissy
2,Guanfacine,High Blood Pressure,9,,"February 20, 2020",5,1 mg dose before bedtime. Works well for hypertension. Went from 166/130 to low normal 96/63 in morning to around 107/65 evenings.  No noticable side effects except for increased micturition.,Anonymous
3,Guanfacine,High Blood Pressure,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 24, 2017",14,This is like poison. Made me dizzy hand and feet sweating legs hurt. This was only taking one 1mg pill.,Wider
4,Guanfacine,High Blood Pressure,7,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 30, 2016",10,Have been on this med for over six months.  I have unstable blood pressure with occasional surges to between 170 and 210 lasting from hours to a few days.  This drug tends to control the surge peaks better than any other med to date.  Side effects are similar to other posts.  Being sleepy and overwhelming drowsy during the day is an issue.  I can handle the dry mouth but the sleepy issue is becoming worse with time on the drug not better.  I am a 76 year old male.  The drug keeps my pressure between 130 and 160 which may still be high but A-OK by my history. One other side effect seems to be opposite to one post is that I have to go to the BR at least four times each night. I take it between 5 and 6PM.,gl2238
5,Guanfacine,High Blood Pressure,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 10, 2015",6,"Didn't have much impact on my blood pressure and I had to discontinue due to side effects.  Extreme dry mouth, fatigue and drowsiness.  Falling asleep at work and struggling to stay awake while driving.",honeyy

7,Guanfacine,High Blood Pressure,10,,"August 31, 2013",19,"This is by far the most effective medicine I have taken for high blood pressure. As another poster said, it needs to be taken with caution at first until you know what dosage is right for you - it can bring your pressure actually low at low dosages. I have found it to have far less side effects than clonidine. It is a long lasting medication able to be taken once a day - I take it at night, as it helps with sleep and by morning any sedative effect has worn off, leaving me with a feeling of well-being. I have not noticed any increase in appetite, but being diabetic I have noticed a rather serious increase in fasting blood sugar which will require tweaking of those medications. Metformin offsets that side effect in a beneficial way.",Audioman7
8,Guanfacine,High Blood Pressure,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 28, 2012",24,"I have been on this 1.5 weeks, it works fantastic for high blood pressure.  Much quicker than 3 previous meds I've tried.  I have serious bladder issues and this has had the unexpected side effect of slowing down my need to visit the loo constantly.  I sleep really well with this medicine, but it makes me tired during the day and hope that will subside soon, I have nodded off at my desk at work several times this week.  Finally, it has increased my appetite and I really want that side effect to go away.",welshlady
9,Guanfacine,High Blood Pressure,4,,"April 19, 2012",15,"Works great for blood pressure but had to stop because of the side effects.  Dry mouth and sleepiness day and night.  Would forget things.  But, the worse was the libido and impotence.  No interest in sex whatsoever.  At 50 that's not a good thing.",Anonymous
10,Guanfacine,High Blood Pressure,10,,"February 21, 2011",47,"Tenex (guanfacine):Works fantastic for high blood pressure. Almost made it too low but it's stabilized now. I've tried 3 different high blood pressure medicines from 3 different drug classes and none work as well as Tenex. The worst side effect I had was dry mouth, but that goes away after a week or 2, so don't quit the drug over that.",antimental
11,Guanfacine,High Blood Pressure,5,,"November 15, 2009",26,Tenex (guanfacine):This medication makes me feel very weak no matter what time of the day I take it. I would not recommend it for anxiety seeing as you have to take it every day in order for it to lower blood pressure and make stressful situations more bearable instead of taking it as needed.,Anonymous
