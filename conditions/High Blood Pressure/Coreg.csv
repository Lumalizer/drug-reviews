0,Coreg,High Blood Pressure,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 14, 2020",16,"I'm now taking carvedilol 25mg/2X after going thru a 1/2 dozen other meds. It seems to stabilise my BP @ 120-70, but all the beta blockers seem to cause side effects. On this drug I have terrible itching, difficulty swallowing and sneezing. The first side effect may be coming from something else and is under review. The middle one may also be coming from something else too but I see ""trachial restriction"" as one of the side effects. The sneezing is 4-6 x per day.  Years back I was on another drug that caused all kinds of problems and my kidneys were discovered to have been damaged. Again, how do you know where these things come from? I wish I could get off these meds with some OTC treatments. Ive tried Beet juice and was in a trial on that awful tasting juice, but it's easier as a pill.",Mac
1,Coreg,High Blood Pressure,10,,"October 3, 2018",51,"Ok been on this since my valve repair in June. Stabilized now at 2 pills 2 x daily 12.5 mg. Since I left the  hospital I noticed my BP had been rising up to 150/101 some days  higher. I was following the directions. Dr. recently also put me on Lisinopril. I went off that after 2 weeks do to bad experience. Medications instructions on the label were to take with food. When I was in the hospital they were waking me at at 4 am and giving me this on an empty stomach and BP hovered around 120/85. So ok why not try that. Bingo back to corrected levels similar to when hospitalized range. This effect last for about 9 hours so adjusted my dose times.  Just remember this is for me, and it is recommended to be taken with food, so you don't get the medication working to quickly which can cause dizziness etc for people.",Ackack

3,Coreg,High Blood Pressure,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 14, 2013",87,I have been taking Cozaar 50 mg a day combined with Coreg 25 mg 2x daily for about 10 years. My blood pressure was 200/120. About 2 years ago Coreg CR 20mg replaced the  Coreg daily. This regimen slowly reduced my BP to 100/60.  This BP was too low so I stopped the Coreg CR completely. I am now on Cozaar 50 mg 1 per day and my BP is averaging 125/60-70.,Bill three
