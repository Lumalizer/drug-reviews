0,Zestril,High Blood Pressure,9.0,,"June 7, 2020",31,"Was put on 30 mg and couldn’t stand up without nearly falling down.  The doc kept reducing dosage to finally 2.5 mg, which I’ve been on for several years with lessened symptoms.",Jack
1,Zestril,High Blood Pressure,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 2, 2014",131,I started taking Lisinopril and was fine then one day I got them refilled and for the next week I was so tired I could barely get out of bed. I was told they changed the place where the pharmacy got the meds which probably meant was a different formula because the pills look different. I requested name brand Zestril even though they were more expensive. I felt 100% better! No more generic for me!,my experience

4,Zestril,High Blood Pressure,9.0,,"October 24, 2012",124,"I have been taking it for 12 years. It was the second ever BP medicine I was ever put on since my diagnosis in 2000. I really have been lucky with this. No cough for me, and when you read the long term side effects, they aren't anywhere near as scary as most everything else you can take. And the interactions are all minimal and favorable for me. My High BP is a mystery as it does not run on either side of my family. Still taking it but had to up the dosage to 40 mg/day due to extreme unavoidable stress in my life.",Internet Space Cadet

In the last 3 years, I started having some chronic dry irritating coughs; and this year have been having problems with erection and libido. Zestril is the only medicine I take. ",Anonymous

11,Zestril,High Blood Pressure,9.0,,"May 3, 2009",71,"Have been taking Zestril for many years, starting with 20 mg, and last year the doctor increased to 40 mg. Have had no noticeable side effects, and it controlled my pressure for many years prior to last year.  I am 75 years old now, so I suppose it is normal to need an increased dosage.  The doctor also added Cardizen CD last year, as I had an episode of rapid heartbeat (over 200bpm) while in his office, and he sent me to the ER.  Since taking Cardizem CD for more than a year, I have had no repeat episodes.  No noticeable side effects either.",RCinNYC
