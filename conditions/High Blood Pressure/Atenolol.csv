2,Atenolol,High Blood Pressure,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 8, 2021",0,"Atenolol has been very good for me. I had racing heart and somewhat high blood pressure caused by Graves disease, and it really helped out while I was stabilizing my antithyroid medication levels. Helped a lot with anxiety, too. I had a thyroidectomy later, and stayed on the atenolol while trying to find the correct dose of thyroid hormone. With all those fluctuations, I could have had annoying heart symptoms, but thanks to the atenolol the transition to synthetic thyroid hormone went smoothly. No side effects, except for some fatigue and mild lightheadedness for a few days when first starting on the medication. The only downside is that atenolol is hard to taper off, at least for me. I went down to 12.5mg for a month and it was ok, but when I stopped it altogether I started having insomnia and episodes of racing heart (after waking up & light exercise). However, I might not be fully stable on the thyroid meds yet, and some of this could be their effect.",lh123

It has been working fine for me all these years, it has lowered my bp.  The last few months or so my anxiety has been crazy, I’m dizzy, nauseous, loss of appetite, I just feel horrible.  It’s weird though I will wake up feeling good and maybe the whole day I will be fine. Then some days I wake up feeling good and then out of nowhere I will feel sick, nauseous and dizzy and tingly all over out of nowhere.  I feel so bad, all I want to do is lay down, then it causes my anxiety to kick in.  I am so frustrated , I am tired of not feeling sick so often.  The doctors say it’s vertigo…. It’s not vertigo!!

Within one hour of taking 12.5 mg my heart beats so hard, skips around and makes me feel like fainting. This lasts usually about an hour. I am constantly nauseous and anxious. I don’t know if this is from the drug or because it scares me so badly when I take it and react this way. I’ve had EKG, Holter and Event monitors and nothing shows except some PACs.

Worst mistake of my life and I made them put me back on it. For those worried about the above interaction between atenolol and albuterol, I did some research using scholarly articles and medical journals.
