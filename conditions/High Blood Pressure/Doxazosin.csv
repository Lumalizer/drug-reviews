0,Doxazosin,High Blood Pressure,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2022",2,I have been on this medication for 2 weeks now and hoping side effects subside. I'm 47yrs old with a Ventricula Septal Defect and It has worked as in lowering my BP but I am struggling in Taekwondo training and have had to sit out due to dizziness and racing heartbeat then swollen feet then I sleep afterwards. This med was added to Lostartan and Felodipine out of desperation to lower BP as other meds didn't suit but this one is probably the worse for side effects so far.,Ann Titty

I have reacted very very badly to a beta blocker in the past but have had no trouble with alpha blockers. The dose is up to 4 mg. twice a day and I have no obvious side effects.

13,Doxazosin,High Blood Pressure,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 4, 2019",107,"My husband was prescribed 4 mg Doxazosin to hopefully reduce the number of trips to the bathroom as well as lowering the blood pressure. It was prescribed in place of the HCTZ that was lowering the Creatinine levels and it was to be taken along with the Metoprolol he had been taking for 2 years. The side effects listed for Doxazosin in the info given by the pharmacy were very generic and no specific warnings were listed on the bottle other than possible impairments while driving. No specific instructions were given by the doctor or pharmacist and it said ""take one a day"" on the bottle.He was a healthy 150 lbs. 78 year old swimming a mile three days a week at the local gym. On the day he started taking Doxazosin he had a fainting or  nearly fainting spell within 45 minutes that resulted in a deadly ground level fall fracturing the skull and closed brain injuries. He died hours later. Please be careful and avoid taking this medication.",Tex
14,Doxazosin,High Blood Pressure,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 4, 2019",42,"I have been on doxazosin for over a year now, along with a few other prescriptions for my high blood pressure and kidneys.  The doctor prescribed 4 mg twice a day.  It works pretty well at reducing my blood pressure, but has some terrible side effects.  I completely lost my drive for sex, which is usually very strong. In addition, it caused retrograde ejaculation (no semen on orgasm). I found that unacceptable, so I reduced  my dosage to 4mg on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  My blood pressure has gotten worse, but my libido and ejaculation has returned to normal.  Got to go back and see doctor, try to find a new medication, but I am running out of options.  I hate this drug.",Brad

17,Doxazosin,High Blood Pressure,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 27, 2018",97,I am on 2mg of Doxasozin and it seems to reduce my blood pressure. Side effects are horrendous though. Exhaustion like you have the flu or are approaching end of life. When I first started on them I couldn't even walk from my car to my office without feeling like I was about to collapse and breathless. I know for sure it is them as I have come off them myself several times and I am back to normal.,cmklein

19,Doxazosin,High Blood Pressure,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 14, 2016",37,"I had radio therapy for testicular cancer in 1977 - aged 30. A camera revealed scarring to my bladder neck in about 2005, and telangectasia (spelling may be wrong). Doxazosin initially prescribed for persistent high blood pressure reasons at 2 mg, but recently raised to 4 then 8 mg per day. Higher doses maybe cause a pounding heart for 1 to 3 hours after waking - not nice. Also a dry mouth and nasal congestion. But urine flow much better when taking the drug. I should also mention that I have various allergies.",omega2498
20,Doxazosin,High Blood Pressure,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 17, 2015",44,"Switched from a non-selective beta blocker for treatment of Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder due to infant adoption. Doctor started me at 4mg, but I blacked out upon getting out of bed three days later. I had the prescription lowered to 1mg, but am taking half now and it is highly effective with virtually no side effects for me. No more PTSD-related nightmares due to the longer half-life, and very little hypervigilance. I am also able to be more physically active now than with a beta blocker, which is great.",mbs83
21,Doxazosin,High Blood Pressure,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 22, 2015",28,"I have had good results using Cardura, but when using a generic, I had problems with dizziness, eyes seemed to be crossed, weakness.  The pill lists lactose as an ""inert"" ingredient.  I have had milk allergies since I was a teenager . Since I cut the 1 mg tab of the very small Cardura in half I was not getting much lactose and it worked fine.  With the generic at least 10 times larger, I was getting much more of the lactose to which I was allergic, so I was having severe side effects. This is the first time I have found the list of inert ingredients.  I was allergic to many medicines before this and the addition of lactose may have been the reason.",sebluebell

25,Doxazosin,High Blood Pressure,10.0,,"July 14, 2011",64,It works better than any other blood pressure medicine I have taken and I have taken many including 3 more that I take beside the doxazosin. I take the doxazosin at night or break it in half and take it in the afternoon if my pressure is running high. It dose not work at all for me regarding prostate issues.,Anonymous

Experienced dizziness and nausea for the first 3 days but later adjusted to the medication and  maintained pressure around 120/80.
