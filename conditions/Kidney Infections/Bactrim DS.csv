0,Bactrim DS,Kidney Infections,7.0,,"December 20, 2021",0,I'm on day 5 taking Bactrim for my kidney infection and I feel just fine. I felt a little nauseous with the first pill but it wasn't bad. I take the morning dose on an empty stomach n more than half a bottle of water. I still get kidney pains here and there though. I hope it's working.,Anonymous
1,Bactrim DS,Kidney Infections,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 18, 2021",0,"Its worked great for me every time I have used it.  But this time I was foolish and tried curing my TUI with apple cider  vinegar,  I should have known better, the infection went to my kidney and then started to go into my respiratory. I have no side effects and one hour into my first dose my chills are going away.",Kidney/uti
2,Bactrim DS,Kidney Infections,2.0,,"November 10, 2020",10,"If you are someone with any sort of stomach sensitivities, food sensitivities, IBS, etc. I strongly recommend you DO NOT use this antibiotic. I am someone with a very sensitive digestive system and am prone to stomach bugs. I had a really bad UTI that led to kidney infection. My first course of antibiotics were gentle, but the infection returned after finishing the course. My doctor recommended Bactrim to get the infection off completely. I suppose it worked, because my urine sample came back normal. However, I could not finish the course because of extreme side effects. Complete loss of appetite, constant vomiting, diarrhea, chills, shaking, panic attacks, the works. I will never take this antibiotic again. Now almost a week later, I still can hardly eat and have constant abdominal pain.",Carly
3,Bactrim DS,Kidney Infections,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 29, 2020",6,I was diagnosed with kidney infections on Monday night. They gave me the Bactrim and sent me on my way home and I got the prescription the next day. Tuesday I spent the day throwing everything up. I couldn’t hold my water down. Wednesday I slept all day and spent my time running back and forth to the bathroom for a shower when I got chills or sweats. I was throwing up even what I didn’t have in my stomach. Thursday I’m starving but the look of food disgusts me. 10 days prescribed I’m on day three of treatment I don’t know how long I’ll last. Also I have these extreme pain in my calf muscles for some weird reason and they don’t go away.,Belen
4,Bactrim DS,Kidney Infections,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 31, 2020",5,Day two second dose put me out all day. Migraine pulsating throbbing headache was so bad. Threw up twice which caused me to fall down from the immense pain in my head. It was amplified by vomiting. I'm afraid to take another pill as it just calmed down after 10 hours of torture.,Ugh
5,Bactrim DS,Kidney Infections,4.0,,"August 25, 2019",14,"(18 yr/o female) I was prescribed this medication after winding up at the emergency room with extreme pain in my right side. After further investigation it turned out to be a kidney cyst that had become severely infected and was getting bled into. I was more than willing to start the medication. I had currently been at Mayo Clinic getting tests done for severe stomach nausea and pain. Yet on the third day of this antibiotic I was miserable. I figured it was my previous stomach issues yet it got worse and worse. I spent day 3 by the toilet thinking I was going to be sick with a low fever. After that I lost my appetite completely, and had this awful twisting spasm start in my upper gut. This spiralled into severe depression, anxiety and not being able to sleep at night. It has kicked my cyst (hopefully) but I am on day 7 after being prescribed for 14 days and I don't know how much more I can take. Good luck to anyone who can brave this medicine.",Gilly

8,Bactrim DS,Kidney Infections,9.0,,"January 2, 2018",9,"I always get digestive issues (severe nausea, diarrhea, gas, upset stomach) from antibiotics. I hadn't taken Bactrim before. For me the side effects have been very minimal. I eat a serving of carbs about 10 minutes before taking it (bread or pasta or a banana) and then drink a large glass of water with it, and have made sure to drink a lot of water generally. I'm also taking a probiotic midday.The side effects I've had are being more tired than usual, low appetite and a bit of a dull headache for a couple days. After the initial dose I had intense nausea but I had not eaten. I have one day remaining of the 7 days course. After one day on Bactrim my infection symptoms went away. I'll need a follow-up but so far, yay Bactrim!!",Raj_1
9,Bactrim DS,Kidney Infections,,,"August 30, 2017",6,"The first two days were fine... I was diagnosed with a kidney infection and it seemed to work pretty well, despite a little nausea... Day 3 is when all hell broke loose. I started a new job and was running errands. I had left the house, took my medicine, grabbed a water bottle but didn't have time to eat what a mistake. 2 hours after taking Bactrim my head felt like it was going to implode. While I was driving on interstate 95 through northern VA I had a quick onset of nausea. There was no where for me to pull off. I ended up vomiting all over myself. By all over myself I mean all over myself and my car. It continued and has now been 24 hours. Went to ER for severe dehydration and am now spending the night at the hospital. Yay!",Martha1992

It seems like it has been cut  with some sort if poison before it gets to the US!!! I just hope I regain strength bc I feel so weak from the pain my body has been through!!!",nick1975
