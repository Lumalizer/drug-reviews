0,Cefpodoxime,Kidney Infections,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 15, 2020",4,"Ok this medicine cefpodoxime is no joke after about an hour of taking medication. My heart started beating fast. And I'm pregnant  my belly started  pounding.  Ok so I decided to take half of pill and then I got  really sick with side effects of  nausea, sweating,  chills, reflux and insomnia.  Will not take again not to mention  this is prescribed for animals  in other countries.  I think  this works but the side effects are awful.",Rosie
