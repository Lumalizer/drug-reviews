0,Cipro,Kidney Infections,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 1, 2022",0,"Went to the doc with the typical symptoms of kidney infection.  While my UA was clear, the doc Rx'ed Cipro.  I'd had a bad reaction in the past (depression) but decided to try again since I was desperate for relief.  This time it hit me completely different--more of a mood lift than anything.  I recall Levaquin making me feel almost hypomanic like this too, which I didn't mind.  More importantly, the infection seems to be improving.  Make sure to read the package insert & follow the dosing instructions carefully.  Take with food & a large glass of water (or two).  Avoid caffeine in any form, calcium/magnesium supplements & sunlight as well as NSAIDs.  If you're worried about tendon rupture, avoid exercise.  Most people don't bother reading the dosing instructions or think they don't apply to them then wonder why the med made them sick.  Obviously fluoroquinolones are heavy duty meds that can cause damage but that goes for many things in life.  Risk vs. benefit.",Lady Xo

3,Cipro,Kidney Infections,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 9, 2020",5,Cipro didn't work at all for mu kidney infection I might be resistant because I had taken it and then discontinued because it because it added to the psychosis that meningitis gave me.  It is an awful medication.,Monic
4,Cipro,Kidney Infections,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 2, 2019",22,"I’m on cipro rn for a kidney infection, and I have never felt so awful. My kidney infection didn’t even hurt this bad. Since starting it 3 days ago I have had the worst migraine ever, the only relief I got was when it was just before the time to take it again, I been trying so hard not to cry cause that makes it so much worst. I’m calling my doctor today because I can’t do this no more. I’m about to go crazy.",Death
5,Cipro,Kidney Infections,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 11, 2019",23,I have taken 5 of the 500 mg so far for a kidney infection so far I have had no side affects and the pain in my back area of kidneys is gone. I am feeling better but was very worried about what I have read on side affect but I will continue to take my dose 2 times a day for 7 days total at this point .,RJ
6,Cipro,Kidney Infections,2,,"May 13, 2017",11,"I was prescribed this medication for a kidney infection. On the third day I developed breathing problems similar to asthma, rapid heart beat, a burning sensation in my chest, and found sleep to be very difficult.",Dm3//
7,Cipro,Kidney Infections,1,,"March 15, 2017",13,"I am not stranger to antibiotics for U.T.I. infections. Just 2 weeks ago was subscribed Cipro the normal is 3 day. This medication did not help me I even got worse with the spasms, frequency and burning. I'm not saying the medication made it worse just saying it doesn't work. I'm on something different and waiting on a culture since my problem got much worse.",Grandmom#1
8,Cipro,Kidney Infections,9,,"January 31, 2017",28,"Second time I am taking this. I am on day 4 of a 5-day prescription. The only side effect I seem to have is an occasional kidney spasm on the right, but who is to say that the medication is causing it? The only thing I would say is that you should always eat something prior to taking your dosage. I forgot once and had a stomach ache for about 30 minutes. I think many people imagine some side effects because they read forums like this and then imagine every little itch is a side effect and they become paranoid. I believe this is a good fast acting medication and I have had no yeast infections from this either, when almost every other antibiotic I have taken did result in yeast infections.I guess I am lucky.",groot77
9,Cipro,Kidney Infections,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 2, 2016",10,"I took Cipro having suffered a UTI from the Mirena Coil that wouldn't clear. As with all medications the side affects depending on the individual can be horrendous. I suffered swellings, hives, a horrendous red rash on both under arms that left my skin damaged. The next side affect was tendonitis in both my ankles that left me unable to walk. I was told that the tablet reacted to the sun Id factor 50 just sitting on the patio for a half an hour and got burned. A nightmare",Morelanddylan
10,Cipro,Kidney Infections,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 6, 2016",23,"I'm no stranger to antibiotics. I've taken many different kinds. I've had side effects to them all, but Cipro was absolutely the worst. I was prescribed 500 mg twice daily for a kidney infection (klebsiella). I could not get passed 3 days. My tendons and joints hurt so bad. I can barely walk as of this morning. I'm terrified it may be permanent. It worked against the infection, but destroyed my joints. Please, get a urine culture and see what antibiotics your bacteria will respond to and choose anything but Cipro or any other fluoroqinolones. These side effects can be permanent, or at least last a long time, maybe even a year!",Michelleagain
11,Cipro,Kidney Infections,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 31, 2016",23,"I took Cipro for a UTI.  Within 3 doses (1.5 days) I went from walking fine, to having severe pain in my left knee and having to limp.  The pain got worse.  Finally, I researched Cipro's side effects and found out that it can cause severe damage to tendons.  I stopped the medication, but the damage was already done.  A year later I had to have surgery to repair some of the damage.  Since then I have read other horror cases like mine.  Cipro seems to find a weak tendon and strike at it.  I will never take this drug again.",Leasey
12,Cipro,Kidney Infections,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 29, 2015",24,"Was given Cipro for a bladder infection. Took it for 5 or 6 days. Every day I felt sicker to the point that I couldn't even eat. Lost 10 pounds in three days. All I could do was sleep. My wife looked it up and found that this antibiotic has fluoride in it. No wonder I felt sick!  I have never had a reaction to any other medications so this was new for me. Within 24 hours of stopping Cipro, I felt like myself again so I knew it was the medication. Fluoride, really?  Can anyone say ""Lab Rat"". Never again!",RFG4578

Every time I know one is coming on, I go to my doctor and this is what is prescribed. This last urinary tract infection I couldn't get treated because I have no insurance and didn't have the money for the office visit. so I tried to wait it out or flush it with water. It eventually turned to a Kidney Infection and I was put on this medication. It does the trick within a day every time.",Review
