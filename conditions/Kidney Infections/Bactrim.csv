I took my first pill in the evening, slept for twelve hours and took another one in the morning. I thought my body just needed the rest, but shortly after the second pill I slept most of the day.

12,Bactrim,Kidney Infections,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 15, 2019",16,"I was prescribed Bactrim after a UTI turned into a kidney infection. The Bactrim wiped out enough of the infection so that I became functional again. However, I wrote this review to warn people prescribed this drug of the following:- I got severe back pain about a week into my 2 week course of Bactrim. It only happened one day and may have been caused by something else.-  I was out in the sun for only a few hours in a tropical place while on Bactrim and got the worst sunburn of my life. I couldn't sleep for 2 nights because the pain and the itch was so bad. Take the warnings about photosensitivity seriously and stay out of the sun or you will be at risk of getting a severe sunburn (Do a computer search on  this to see how bad it can get. No doctor properly warned me of this).- I got UTI symptoms again about a week after my 2 week course was done. I'm now on another antibiotic.",Sarah

18,Bactrim,Kidney Infections,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 9, 2018",9,I was prescribed bactrim twice daily for a week for a suspected kidney infection. I only got through two and a half days of the medication before I stopped taking it because I was so tired I couldn’t function and my skin became sore in certain places. I was taking 3-4 naps a day and my muscles were so weak I had to sit to even brush my hair. I am 28 weeks pregnant and a mother to a 20 month old so there is no way I could get through a week of not being able to function. I couldn’t even hold my daughter without having to sit down.,Allijo1314

20,Bactrim,Kidney Infections,1.0,,"December 6, 2017",14,"I was prescribed Bactrim for a kidney infection. I took two doses, 500 mgs each. After the first dose, I began to feel lousy. I assumed it was a side effect. The second dose almost killed me. I went to the ER, where I was stabilized enough to move me to ICU. Before I lost consciousness, my blood pressure was 35/27. I woke up 3 days later with a central line, severely swollen body, and my skin was bright red, like a severe sunburn. I spent 3 weeks in the hospital, with my blood pressure constantly plummeting. I apparently have a severe allergy.",Sarah2210
21,Bactrim,Kidney Infections,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2017",21,"I was a bit of a moron and let a UTI go for too long. I had pain on and off for a few months in my back. Pee was cloudy, frequent urination..all that good stuff but two days ago I woke up and felt absolutely terrible. I was so nauseous, couldn’t eat anything, awful headache, chills and the worst back pain I had ever felt. I went to Dr and she wrote this for me. I took two pills yesterday and already today I feel a 100x’s better. I don’t believe it is for everyone obviously due to the mixed reviews and my mother had taken it before and it had awful effects on her as well but I do believe it’s worth trying because for me it’s been wonderful. I couldn’t even bend over yesterday and today all I have is slight dull pain in my back.Worked perfect",Ashxlynn88
22,Bactrim,Kidney Infections,5.0,,"March 8, 2017",14,"I had a UTI that went into a kidney infection, They put me on Bactrim, Didn't notice any side effects until a few days later, I started feeling depressed out of no where and it got worse from there, I ended up in the hospital with the worst headache of my life, I was shaking and throwing up I didn't even think it had anything to do with the Bactrim. The depression got so bad I ended up at the  psychiatric hospital, I had no idea why I was feeling like this, it was by far the worst feeling in the world, When I came home and went to see my therapist and told her what was going on she  immediately asked me what medicine they put me on and when I told her she said look up the side effects to that and sure enough everything was listed.",Arey

24,Bactrim,Kidney Infections,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2017",9,"I got sick the day after Christmas. Thought i was just having nausea, but it progressed to a very painful tummy and back so I went to the er with my husband a few days later. I had a kidney infection, so they put me on the generic for bactrim for 10 days. I felt no different till a few days in, and that's when I got some relief but also side effects such as persistant and constant nausea, and headaches. Wasn't too bad. Then I felt excited on my last day because I truly felt better (minus stomach cramps that I didn't think were serious at the time). But then less than 24 hours later I started feeling bad again with my back and tummy, so we went to the ER and they put me on the generic for macrobid. This is day one of that. We'll see how it g",marielove91

26,Bactrim,Kidney Infections,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 30, 2015",34,"Really effective, but really terrible side-effects.

27,Bactrim,Kidney Infections,10.0,,"November 24, 2015",52,"Please don't let anyone scare you into not taking this. If you're like me with new medicine, you go online and research every little side effect and review and convince yourself not to take it. I was really scared to take this as I had bad reactions to Macrobid and Ciprofloxacin, and after reading these reviews I just knew it was going to be the same way. I'm on day two, no side effects other than a little nausea and a headache. That's the worst of it. We'll see how it goes by day 7, but so far this has been the best antibiotic I've taken.",Lisaxx22
28,Bactrim,Kidney Infections,,,"June 6, 2015",16,"Rushed to the ER because of unbearable flank pain. Doctor noticed a large amount of white blood cells in the urine, and prescribed Bactrim. The first two days I felt okay, nothing really improved. By the fifth day the back pain disappeared but the urge to pee was still present. Sixth day I got a high fever, headaches, body aches, and a rash. Felt like crap! Stopped taking it and side effects subsided. I'm severely allergic to Bactrim. Was prescribed Cipro, it works great!",Anonymous
29,Bactrim,Kidney Infections,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 22, 2014",43,"Took this medicine for a horrible horrible HORRIBLE kidney infection. Worked within 2 days and cleared up all of my symptoms, which was such a relief. I was told to finish off the bottle by my doctor, and the next day I developed a horrible case if the hives. I stopped taking the medicine immediately, but the hives stuck around for another 3 days. What a miserable week! So, Bactrim worked wonders for my kidney infection, but little did I know I was severely allergic to it. Take with caution.",LindsayNicole
