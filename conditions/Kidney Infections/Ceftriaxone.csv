0,Ceftriaxone,Kidney Infections,10,,"April 12, 2020",0,"Went to urgent care for a presumed kidney infection (had one before, felt the same excruciating flank pain). The dr suggested treating me right off the bat for one while we would wait for the proper lab results to come back for confirmation. Within a few hours of her poking me in the opposite hip, I felt immense relief. She prepared me for the shot itself to be painful, but I did not think it was bad at all; just a tad sore to the touch that night.",CC
1,Ceftriaxone,Kidney Infections,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 9, 2015",7,Rocephin (ceftriaxone):An injection of Rocephin does hurt a little but it's reconstituted with Lidocaine to lessen the pain. If you are not faint at heart with shots and you don't have an allergen to the drug than it will work wonders for you.,Anonymous
