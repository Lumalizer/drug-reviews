0,Keflex,Kidney Infections,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 19, 2020",12,"Had bad kidney infection, given MacroBID for 3 days, after 2 days  wasn't working given another 4 days worth. After another 2 days still wasn't working called online private doctor prescribed Keflex 500mg 3 times day 7 days. Kidney infection calmed down after 2 days wasn't sure if it was doing anything for bladder infection, still had pain and discomfort throughout 7 day course. Side effects severe itchiness particularly torso. When finished course still had bladder discomfort but worse was itch!  2 days later the itch on body gone but hands and fingers were still really bad  constant itching, scratching skin raw. Read that Keflex stays in system for 72 hours. Have had muscle pain throughout course which confused about whether kidney infection getting better as back muscles hurt. No stomach problems. Can say Keflex sorted kidney infection not sure about bladder infection",DinnerLady
