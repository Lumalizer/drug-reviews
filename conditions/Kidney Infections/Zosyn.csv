0,Zosyn,Kidney Infections,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 22, 2020",4,"I had this medication as an IV infusion while hospitalized for a severe UTI and kidney infection. The only symptom I had was major diarrhea. Often, I couldnâ€™t even make it out of the bed in time and my stool had a strange, strong smell. Even for days after stopping the treatment. I suggest taking a probiotic with it.",Jen904

2,Zosyn,Kidney Infections,,,"March 27, 2012",15,During my hospital stay I went through numerous antibiotics all of which made me sick until Zosyn took only a few mins to go through my body and made me feel almost completely normal. I absolutely loved it.,Anonymous
