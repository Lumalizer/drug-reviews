0,Ciprofloxacin,Kidney Infections,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2022",0,"I was given these from the hospital for a severe kidney infection. The dosage was two 500mg for 5 days. Worst tablets I've ever been on, they made me want to self detonate. They have even gave me Jaundice which is a 1 in 1000 chance. They were very fast acting towards the kidney and kidney pain which is good but side effects were very very nasty.Side effects I experienced: - severe nausea - dry mouth - vomiting - dizziness - abdominal pain -headache - muscle aches- confusion - extreme fatigue - fever and cold sweats - jaundice (yellowing of skin, eyes and urine) I've been off the tablets for about 48 hours now (thank God) but now need time be treated for jaundice. Only good thing I can say about these is that they are very fast acting. I wouldn't recommend these at all even if you are desperate please ask for something else.",Pearl28
1,Ciprofloxacin,Kidney Infections,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2022",0,"Currently on day 4 of 7 of my Ciprofloxacin regiment for a kidney infection. I haven't had a nightmare of an experience by any means but this is definitely one nasty drug. Within 20 mins of ingesting, I experience quite intense abdominal cramping on my left and it's worse than my kidney pain. This lasts about 30min-1 hour until my muscles relax again so I take an Advil in preparation for it which helps. I've also been experiencing heavy night sweats. It's a little hard to determine what is the result of my infection and what is a side effect of the medication but I'm quite confident about these two in particular. I take the pill with about 500ml-1L of water. Food doesn't seem to make much of a difference for me. The restrictions for dairy also make the morning scheduling super annoying as yogurt and granola is my go to. All that said, my kidney infection pain is all but gone now and I feel like I'm on the road to recovery so it is effective; it's just a pain the way it goes about it.",DanJoe
2,Ciprofloxacin,Kidney Infections,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 14, 2022",0,"I would strongly caution you about taking this drug for anything. While it is widely prescribed, the side effects are not obvious on the leaflet you get from the pharmacy. I spoke to gps, a nurse, and a pharmacist and they didn’t know about the risks of the drug induced neuropathy I started experiencing after taking just two pills. I was experiencing pins and needles, numbness in my leg and foot. It was scary and I am a 31 year old female who has never had a reaction to antibiotics except a small rash. The FDA warns this is side effect is 50% more likely with this class of drugs! There are so many other options of antibiotics out there. At the first sign of trouble, I stopped this drug immediately and took bromelain, magnesium, b6 and was switched to amoxicillin. The side effects started to regress two days after stopping. Please be careful!",Sc123
3,Ciprofloxacin,Kidney Infections,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 1, 2022",0,"Cipro (ciprofloxacin):Went to the doc with the typical symptoms of kidney infection.  While my UA was clear, the doc Rx'ed Cipro.  I'd had a bad reaction in the past (depression) but decided to try again since I was desperate for relief.  This time it hit me completely different--more of a mood lift than anything.  I recall Levaquin making me feel almost hypomanic like this too, which I didn't mind.  More importantly, the infection seems to be improving.  Make sure to read the package insert & follow the dosing instructions carefully.  Take with food & a large glass of water (or two).  Avoid caffeine in any form, calcium/magnesium supplements & sunlight as well as NSAIDs.  If you're worried about tendon rupture, avoid exercise.  Most people don't bother reading the dosing instructions or think they don't apply to them then wonder why the med made them sick.  Obviously fluoroquinolones are heavy duty meds that can cause damage but that goes for many things in life.  Risk vs. benefit.",Lady Xo

My dreams do tend to be a little scary on it, but if that’s what it takes to get rid of a serious infection then I’ll do it. The infection scares me more than side effects.

I should have known better after reading the three pages of warnings, but given my positive track record with medications I figured I'd give it a go, which was a bad decision. The first day on Cipro was mostly uneventful. I did have a small problem with blood sugar levels, but that was expected since it was listed as a possible mild side effect. By day two I started noticing pain in my inner thighs. Not a lot at first, but by day three the tendons in both legs felt like they were on fire. I called my doctor and was told to stop. It's been three days since I stopped taking Cipro and the pain continues. I am unable to sleep unless I pass out from exhaustion. I require assistance with walking, and have difficulty concentrating. I wish I had read the reviews before taking this stuff. As others have said, you are rolling the dice with Cipro. It really needs to be removed from the market.",WishingCiproneverexhisted

Added to this suddenly I started experiencing severe pain in rotar cuff, left arm. The pain was so severe I could not sleep. Months of physiotheraphy followed. Slight improvement. I recently was once again prescribed Ciprofloxacin for a UTI. I took one pill and broke out in huge red flat blotches all over my body. I stopped taking all meds and went to the Dr. The Dr told me to try again and take no other meds to see if it was indeed the Ciprofloxacin as by the next day the blotches had disappeared. Once again after taking another Ciprofloxacin I broke out in huge red flat blotches and my eyes started to itch and my throat started closing up. I stopped taking it immediately. By the following day red blotches had disappeared almost entirely. Since then the severe pain in my rotar cuff is back. This after taking only two Ciprofloxacin tablets.",Samatha

My throat had swelled up due to this medication so no other medication went down my throat and luckily I hadn't eaten solid foods. because it had swelled up, I also could not breathe normally. I had constant shortness of breath. I revisited the health center and was told that I had an allergic reaction to this med and that this medication is not recommended whatsoever since it is outdated. BEWARE if you are given cipro, I would suggest having it swapped out to another medication. I could have easily died if I took another dose and if my throat swelled up even more I wouldn't be able to catch a breath. I really feel lucky that I got the help quickly.",naya

I've had side effects to them all, but Cipro was absolutely the worst. I was prescribed 500 mg twice daily for a kidney infection (klebsiella). I could not get passed 3 days. My tendons and joints hurt so bad. I can barely walk as of this morning. I'm terrified it may be permanent. It worked against the infection, but destroyed my joints. Please, get a urine culture and see what antibiotics your bacteria will respond to and choose anything but Cipro or any other fluoroqinolones. These side effects can be permanent, or at least last a long time, maybe even a year!",Michelleagain

I can't say how effective it is, because I dont have an infection. I just wanted to comment on side effects. I did not have any side effects at all that I'm aware of.

52,Ciprofloxacin,Kidney Infections,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 31, 2016",23,"Cipro (ciprofloxacin):I took Cipro for a UTI.  Within 3 doses (1.5 days) I went from walking fine, to having severe pain in my left knee and having to limp.  The pain got worse.  Finally, I researched Cipro's side effects and found out that it can cause severe damage to tendons.  I stopped the medication, but the damage was already done.  A year later I had to have surgery to repair some of the damage.  Since then I have read other horror cases like mine.  Cipro seems to find a weak tendon and strike at it.  I will never take this drug again.",Leasey
53,Ciprofloxacin,Kidney Infections,8.0,,"March 15, 2016",36,"I was nervous to take Cipro because I had made the mistake of reading online reviews.  To people like me who get anxiety about medication: just think, people who willingly write a review online about medication probably had an extreme or unpleasant experience, but that does not make them the majority.  I'm a petite woman that was prescribed 500 mg two times a day for a week.  The first time I took the pill I felt a bit lightheaded and woke up a tad nauseous.  However, I was not on a full stomach (too nauseous to eat with my kidney infection) and I made the mistake of not drinking a full glass of water with the pill.  As long as you do those things and avoid dairy (among other things like NSAIDs, etc) you'll be fine.  Feeling much better now",ATCCAL

I am handling it well, but as a powerlifter and learning what it does to your joints and tendons is terrifying. BE CAREFUL while training if you are active. This medicine can cause rips in your tendons and swelling of joints. It can take months to repair. I've stayed away from the gym while on my cycle of cipro. Be smart with this drug and it will do miracles. As for the fluoride, NO idea why it's in there. It plays no part in the healing process and is only used to cloud your judgement. (P.S. Fluoride was first put in concentrate camps to cause the prisoners confusion, delayed reactions, and a foggy mind.) Do your research people!",MissChris717
