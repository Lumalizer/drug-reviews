0,Cephalexin,Kidney Infections,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 24, 2021",0,"I just started my prescription 3 days ago 500 mg twice a day for a nasty UTI turned Kidney infection. It took me a good week to actually take it after reading these reviews. I hate swallowing pills so I open my capsule and take it with OJ. So far the only major issues I get is gas, a little nauseous and minor headache. I get sleepy after a while but, I think that’s due to the infection. I feel like my infection is clearing up I’m on my 3rd full dose. My kidneys only hurt a little I find taking my pills with lots of water has been very helpful. I also take a probiotic to replace the good bacteria. I’ll be going back to the Doc to confirm the infection is gone in 4 days. Get well everyone!",Anonymous
1,Cephalexin,Kidney Infections,1.0,,"July 14, 2021",0,"I took this for 24 hours only. Had to stop after the first day because of the side effects. Headaches, extreme fatigue, sharp pains in my vagina, extremely bad diarrhoea. It’s been a day and a half since I took the last one and the diarrhoea is every 60 mins and just water. I hope I feel better soon. Will never take this again",Anne95
2,Cephalexin,Kidney Infections,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 22, 2020",4,I've had many UTIs before and they normally give me Cipro- which works great for me. My doctor told me that Cipro apparently causes tendon rupture so they gave me cephalexin antibiotic instead (amoxicillin does nothing for me anymore). Cephalexin makes me so exhausted that I'm now sleeping almost all day and have started missing my alarms to take it again! I'm on the 3rd day and I'm barely feeling better (I'm taking it 2x a day every 12 hour for 7 days at 500 mg.) Not to mention it's giving me unpleasant dreams and making me SO itchy! I'm not sure if I'm accidentally overdosing myself to try to catch up on missed doses and causing these side effects or what... but after this round I'm requesting that they NEVER give me these antibiotics again!,Elean
3,Cephalexin,Kidney Infections,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 7, 2020",3,"I started on cephalexin for a UTI, three days ago and it is a five day course, twice per day (500 mg). Since, I have horror side-effects from Bactrim, and Microbid. I am not feeling too good from this medicine either. Horrible fatigue, constant headaches, weak. I’m beside myself, since I’m constantly getting UTI’s. I will probably take Cipro, next time. It’s not my 1st choice, however it doesn’t make me feel this bad.",Ms. M
4,Cephalexin,Kidney Infections,,,"September 15, 2020",27,Okay so now after nearly two weeks of getting diagnosed with a Kidney Infection and of me coming here to read the reviews  (a lot of me crying) of how it works for everyone else. here is mine.  I was taking one cephalexin pill 500 mg twice a day for 14 days I am on day 13; I didn’t start feeling better until day 4 which scared me because it seem that I was healing slower than others. I still had kidney pain at day 10 but now I don’t. This pill after 5 day’s made me sleepy and nauseous but that’s about it. I did find that on day 12 I started to pee out blood again but I knew it came from vagina by the discharge with it so I ended up getting BV with this pill which doesn’t surprise me it is antibiotic. So please know you may not feel better until four of five days every one heals differently. I wish you a speedy recovery :),Lillixgirl
5,Cephalexin,Kidney Infections,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 23, 2020",11,"56 year old male, I unknowingly had a kidney infection, my first symptom was aural hallucinations, that became more frequent and louder over several days, before I went to ER. While hospitalized overnight, and the doctor thinking I had a mental issue, the infection finally caused me having difficulty being able to urinate, and pain when I finally was able to get some flow going. The doctor then said I had a UTI/kidney infection (rarer in men that women) pretty common in elderly women including the hallucinations. I was sent home with Cipro, it somewhat stabilized the infection, but and reduced it’s symptoms, but didn’t rid me of it. Then went on Keflex 500mg 3x a day, for 14 days. By day 2, hallucinations were gone, day 3 no obvious symptoms, I took the full course of 14 days, and everything is great. I had some mild side effects, but compared to aural and some visual and tactile hallucinations, side effects were nothing.",Master Chief

7,Cephalexin,Kidney Infections,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 25, 2020",14,I took cephalexin to treat a UTI. I started to get really bad anxiety out of nowhere. It started on the second day (I took this antibiotica over 7 days) and the panic attacks stopped after about 3 weeks since I took them for the first time. I even got them at night.

8,Cephalexin,Kidney Infections,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 16, 2020",8,"I’ve been taking this medication on and off for about 5 ish years for bad UT/kidney infections. I’ve had it in liquid form and in pill form however I can’t take pills so I crack them in apple sauce. Smells like rotten eggs but I can tolerate it. Doesn’t taste that bad. I don’t have dizziness, no diarrhea. When I have an infection, I always feel better while I’m on this medication. I don’t feel bad while on it. It’s a big relief. I can take this on an empty stomach with no stomach issues and let me tell you, I’m SENSITIVE and I have a screwed up gut and it doesn’t bother my gut. I’m a small girl 4’11 petite and I usually take 1 pill 4 times a day. Now the only issue I get is yeast infections but that’s common. I’d take yeast infections over having stomach problems any day.

I’m 9 weeks pregnant at the moment. Not sure if that was making this worse or not, but I had the WORST fatigue I’ve ever experienced. I was physically unable to get out of bed other than to use the bathroom and shower. My body felt extremely heavy and I was very confused and out of it. It make me nausea I was already experiencing 10 times worse. I ended up having a severe episode of heart racing for about 10 minutes on the 4th day. Blood pressure shot up to 150 and pulse got high. I threw this away. Listen to your body. I know it’s important to finish medications but when the side effects are this bad this is dangerous. Since my urine has completely stopped burning and it’s clear again, I have made another appointment with my doctor to confirm my infection is gone. Home tests came back negative. If not, I will request something else because this was AWFUL.",anon156

Pregnancy makes me tired and nauseous but this literally takes me out. I am so sleepy and out of it. I feel drunk or something.

14,Cephalexin,Kidney Infections,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 21, 2019",9,"Went to the ER Sunday for pain in back, constant feeling of needing to pee, pain when urinating, and blood in urine. Diagnosed with a Kidney infection and was prescribed 500mg of Keflex 2x a day for 10 days.Since then there isn’t anymore blood or pain when I pee. I also don’t have to go every 2 seconds but it’s day 4 and I’m having some wicked side effects. I am exhausted. I still definitely have the infection (had a follow up appointment already) so that could be contributing to the tiredness but I’m falling asleep every 2-3 hours. First 2 days I had terrible diarrhea but now I’m constipated. The stomach cramps are also really not fun. Taking lots of Advil to help with that.

I thought I was just feeling the effects of the drive.Then the pain got so bad I could barely move without screaming out. I was rushed to hospital and found out one of my kidneys was severely infected. They told me it was most likely from an untreated UTI.

20,Cephalexin,Kidney Infections,8.0,,"August 27, 2018",14,"I felt woozy for a couple of days. Then, I had stabbing pain in my side that radiated to my lower back. Doc diagnosed me with a kidney infection and put me on Cephalexin. Despite the meds, back pain and side ache felt horrible. I continued to take the meds despite feeling tremendously nauseous, even dry vomiting once, feverish, cold chills and no appetite. The thought of food made me retch. Kind of thought I could die. I drank lots of lemon infused water. After the 7th dose, 36 hours from the first pill, I was no longer in pain or nauseous. I had a migraine but the doc told me to avoid coffee and and once I had a cup of coffee the migraine went away, too. Four days later and I'm good as new but I'm going to continue taking the meds. I'm on 250mg 4x a day for 7 days. I suspect the medication is making my muscles tense and I am not sleeping well, just 5 hours a night. 4x a day is a hassle. I was tempted to take 500 mg 2x a day but I didn't want to risk a set back.",Miss McCahfee

I am usually incredibly sensitive to antibiotics, but this one has been okay! It will take your body some time to get use to the medication. I had an awful headache the first two or three days but it got better. The joint pain and nausea improved as well. Eat yogurt and take Keflex with food, it helps A TON.

Thought the UTI symptoms subsided they were replaced with a spell of horrible side effects from the medication. I woke up every couple of hours to drink water because I felt dehydrated then I would quickly throw the water up. I had frequent sleep paralysis nightmares and was beginning to hallucinate, experience anxiety, and a sore throat. When I cough it gives me a splitting headache. The absolute delirium I feel mixed with the blurry vision I was experiencing, joint pain, and confusion on top of everything else absolutely freaked me out. So much so that I was even scared to lay down alone in my room, I walked very hunched back to my computer due to back pain and looked up the medication to find that many have experienced all of these symptoms as well. I am really agitated that I have to take this medication for 6 more days. I don't think I will finish it.",Rach
