Within a few days, my skin began peeling on my fingers and toes, then my nails began to shed/peel. After a couple more days, the bottoms of my feet peeled in HUGE chunks. I was pulling hand sized pieces of skin off. I stopped taking the drug, but the peeling continued for at least a month.",ICE

4,Levofloxacin,Kidney Infections,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 9, 2019",5,"I was in the hospital for 4 days with a bacterial kidney infection. I was miserable the whole time. Received IV antibiotics which I've forgotten the names, however when I was sent home it was with a prescription of Levoquin 750mg for 10 days.  I've never had such side effects as with this drug.  I could not take the last 2 pills because I felt like it was making a hole in my stomach.  My side effects included severe insomnia, constant nausea, sensitive to light, weakness, fingertips started hurting, drinking anything to include water tasted terrible.  I've heard about tendon damage but I hope I don't develop anything else. It has been over a week since I stopped taking these and I am still weak, (no energy) and the nausea doesn't go away. I'm scared to take any antibiotic at this point.",Jules
5,Levofloxacin,Kidney Infections,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 19, 2018",20,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):I was hospitalized for 3 days and given the IV antiobiotic Rocephin for a kidney infection.  After being discharged, I was given a 4 day course of Levaquin, 750mg dosage.Side effects started within hours, first nerve pain (peripheral neuropathy) in soles of feet, then within a day extended up to my knees and from my fingertips to my shoulders. After the 3rd pill, muscle weakness appeared alongside the nerve pain.   I was lucky that within 10 days of taking my last pill, all side effects were gone.I was told by my regular GP to never take the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics again.  This is a serious drug, and the nerve pain I experienced could have been permanent.  I'd only recommend taking fluoroquinolones as a last resort.  Read the FDA black box warnings and if your dr doesn't take them seriously, I'd find a new GP",Marie

7,Levofloxacin,Kidney Infections,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 22, 2017",11,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):I was prescribed this for a kidney infection.   I took one dose.  With that dose I felt so sick to my stomach, had horrible anxiety, my face felt hot and I felt sweaty. My calves of my legs also felt sore.  I stopped after that first dose because I felt so awful and read some pretty scary side effects!   I went to a different Dr and he put me on doxy which is much safer.",Koober1
8,Levofloxacin,Kidney Infections,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 2, 2017",13,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):I took levoFLOXacin for ten days as the third antibiotic for a kidney infection.  The first antibiotic cleared one bacteria and the 2nd and 3rd cleared up the 2nd bacteria.  The only adverse reaction was to levoFLOXacin.  About day 6, I woke during the night with pain in my right arm, from the upper arm to the top of my hand. I thought I'd slept on it wrong. But the pain continued, mostly in the upper arm until 2 days after I completed the regimen.  Now, 2 weeks later, I continue to experience pain .  If I carry anything the least bit heavy, the upper arm hurts.  Yesterday I used it as little as possible but did use my right arm. I had some pain all the way to the top if my hand again.  I had reaction to Cipro. I shouldn't have taken this drug.",Right arm

10,Levofloxacin,Kidney Infections,1.0,,"April 26, 2017",2,After 4 doses of 500 mg I got terrible headache and ended up 2 1/2 days in hospital. Every bad side effect I have now. I am 69 and should never have gotten this drug. The PERMANENT effects are quite bothersome! It endangered my life and the future looks not good,Cyrno
11,Levofloxacin,Kidney Infections,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 8, 2016",23,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):I have taken Levaquin on various occasions for uti.I never really had side effects after only a week of it. The improvement in the infection was pretty rapid and remarkable. In 2 days I felt better than I had in 3 months, so I was suffering from this uti off and on for awhile. Doxycycline and Keflex couldn't touch it.   I consider Levaquin the gold standard for a uti. Unfortunately this time I had a kidney infection as well, so I was really miserable.However, if you take Levaquin for several weeks you can have tendon and muscle problems.but my gosh, you have to get rid of the infection or you'll die. so I recommend this over Cipro. Cipro sometimes has to be taken again. I always recommend Levaquin to people.",golfhat

Like other reviewers I had similar side effects ; terrible headaches , nausea, sleeplessness, aches in joints.  I'm an avid tennis player and worry about tendon damage. I must admit the back pain is better in two days but still have frequent urination issues. The doctor ordered a culture which should be back soon and perhaps offer another alternative with fewer side effects.",10sgal

I have epilepsy, Pallindromic arthritis, and Lupus. After reading this information. My husband picked up the script for me and he was told that these needed to be taken at the same time.
