I had a great experience and would take it again in the future if needed.  My symptoms cleared up quickly and I felt fine while on it.  No GI side effects.  I was a tiny bit ""jittery"" on Day 1 but otherwise felt quite well.  Be incredibly vigilant about drinking tons of WATER (not just any fluids). Even though I drank lots of water, I did still feel dehydrated while on Bactrim DS but I just kept at it.

It only happened one day and may have been caused by something else.-  I was out in the sun for only a few hours in a tropical place while on Bactrim and got the worst sunburn of my life. I couldn't sleep for 2 nights because the pain and the itch was so bad. Take the warnings about photosensitivity seriously and stay out of the sun or you will be at risk of getting a severe sunburn (Do a computer search on  this to see how bad it can get.

After further investigation it turned out to be a kidney cyst that had become severely infected and was getting bled into. I was more than willing to start the medication. I had currently been at Mayo Clinic getting tests done for severe stomach nausea and pain. Yet on the third day of this antibiotic I was miserable. I figured it was my previous stomach issues yet it got worse and worse. I spent day 3 by the toilet thinking I was going to be sick with a low fever. After that I lost my appetite completely, and had this awful twisting spasm start in my upper gut. This spiralled into severe depression, anxiety and not being able to sleep at night. It has kicked my cyst (hopefully) but I am on day 7 after being prescribed for 14 days and I don't know how much more I can take. Good luck to anyone who can brave this medicine.",Gilly

I woke up at 2am absolutely drenched head to toe in sweat, with chills... couldn't  fall back asleep. The next day I had the worst headache... terrible, terrible pain in the base of my skull, and a horribly stiff and sore neck. Any time I stood up I could feel my blood pressure in my head sore, just throbbing. I had zero appetite. I stopped the Rx after 2.5 days. I felt worse after I started the Rx than before it. Never, ever again.",tducheneau

The depression got so bad I ended up at the  psychiatric hospital, I had no idea why I was feeling like this, it was by far the worst feeling in the world, When I came home and went to see my therapist and told her what was going on she  immediately asked me what medicine they put me on and when I told her she said look up the side effects to that and sure enough everything was listed.",Arey

I felt no different till a few days in, and that's when I got some relief but also side effects such as persistant and constant nausea, and headaches. Wasn't too bad. Then I felt excited on my last day because I truly felt better (minus stomach cramps that I didn't think were serious at the time). But then less than 24 hours later I started feeling bad again with my back and tummy, so we went to the ER and they put me on the generic for macrobid. This is day one of that.

It clears my uti and kidney infection everytime. I must say the side effects are worth the relief. What I experienced as side effects are, painful tongue almost instantly, joint pain toward the end, and loss of appetite. I did notice if you drink enough water with this antibiotic it makes all these symptoms less noticeable. The last time my tongue pain I could hardly feel it, joint pain was there but bearable, loss of appetite well I saw that as a bonus. Make sure to drink lots of water and I mean lots. Also make sure to take a good probiotic so you don't get a yeast infection afterwards. I ate a lot of yogurt with a probiotic. God bless!",swoods789
