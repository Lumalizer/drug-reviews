1,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Kidney Infections,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 9, 2020",12,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):Was prescribed this Augmentin (875/125) 2 doses a day for 7 days after being misdiagnosed with a UTI and on Keflex for a week before that did nothing for my fever or pain or infection. When I was finally diagnosed with a Kidney infection, I started taking Augmentin. I’m on day 3 and feeling SO much better without my fever and kidney pain. However I am having mild side affects. I get a decent headache within hours of taking each dose, and there is some diarrhea. However taking it with food lessens those side effects and the main thing I know is helping is taking good probiotics daily as well that has helped keep my flora balanced and prevent the thrush a lot of people experience after this medication. Very effective, just be sure to replenish the good bacteria in your system as you are taking it.",AB
2,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Kidney Infections,,,"November 14, 2019",15,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):I was prescribed Augmentin  for a severe double kidney infection. Although , I took a second dose way before I was due to have it, in fact about 2 hours after the first dose , due to the fact and my reasoning to get on top of this infection. The first dose was no problems  I couldn't even tell that  I had taken it . The second dose , within ten minutes  I had the worst anxiety I have ever experienced as well as , a panic attack with heart palpitations, chest pain and tightness and the general feeling I was  suddenly at the end of my life. I had the phone in one hand getting ready to call 911 with the reasoning to myself that I could have mere moments left to be able to even make the call and the other hand trying to keep my balance as I hadSevere shaking and muscle twitching and the sense I had little control over my own body’s . Never again , I would rather take my chances against the double kidney infection .",Kbr

Thank God I had a bottle of Amox-clav I started taking it and  so far I'm feeling a lot better and don't have to worry about the scary side effects some people have trouble with taking Amox-clav but I'm so far I'm not having any issues its helped me in so many ways for once I'm not hurting when I have to go to the bathroom. These antibiotics are a real life saver,Shycat
