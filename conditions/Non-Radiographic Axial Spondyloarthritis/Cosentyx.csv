0,Cosentyx,Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 31, 2021",0,"I have psoriatic spondylitis that is now worsening over the last two years to PSA.  Cosentyx was the first drug I started on.  I found the injection hard to push in without it burning. The biggest things that hit me within a couple days were bone crushing fatigue that had me holding onto furniture and the wall and bed bound by day 4.  I ran labs and it tanked my B12 by 400 points within a week.  I also have hormone records at the time and my testosterone and thyroid took a nose dive AFTER one dose of this injection.  Then the headaches, vision issues, and pain though not as severe as the fatigue. were worrisome.  I decided to stop the drug at that point.  Any drug that is hitting me in multiple spots that is keeping me from performing my responsibilities is NOT a drug I will continue to inject in myself.",D
1,Cosentyx,Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 22, 2020",3,"I am a 65 year old white female. I was diagnosed with nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis two years ago after experiencing both peripheral and axial arthritis symptoms and enthesitis. I was first prescribed Cimzia in 2019 and was on this drug for 9 weeks with slight improvement in my back but then began having worsening of symptoms in my feet, ankles, and hips. After six months off any medication I tried Cosentyx. There was no improvement in my symptoms and in the 11th week (6 shots total) I again experienced a worsening of my symptoms in my SI joints and my feet and ankles, with acute pain from plantar fasciitis and milder Achilles tendonitis. I am waiting for this flare reaction to the drug to subside before trying Enbrel. Hope and pray the third biologic  is the charm.",Maggie
