0,Hydrochlorothiazide,Nephrocalcinosis,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 29, 2019",16,"I have been taking 25mg hydrochlorothiazide for kidney stones for 2 months and so far I have experienced vision problems, extreme constipation (even with the 2 stool softeners a day my dr prescribed), non-existent libido, headaches and fatigue/weakness. Not sure if the fatigue is associated with the medication or the inability to have a regular BM. Awful medication. Will ask tomorrow for a 24-hour urine culture to see if my numbers have changed. Need to get to get off this medication sooner rather than later.",Stonemaker
1,Hydrochlorothiazide,Nephrocalcinosis,8.0,,"February 10, 2017",17,"Taking 12.5 mg. Started taking this a week ago for HBP. Blood pressure dropped within acceptable range within one day No side effects whatsoever.",Jam54
2,Hydrochlorothiazide,Nephrocalcinosis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 8, 2015",10,"I was put on this to lower my chances of getting more kidney stones. I've been on this a few days now & wanted to share my experiences early on. At first I felt no difference but the second day I started feeling extreme dry mouth, headache, lower leg cramping & some frequency of urination, although I drink a lot of water 1/2 to 3/4 of a gallon a day but from what I've read here these are normal side effects as my body adjusts to the medication. I'm going to keep on this until I see the doctor for a recheck in a couple of weeks & hopefully these side effects will subside.I'm mainly staying on it too out of fear of a returning kidney stone.",Hellinahandbasket
3,Hydrochlorothiazide,Nephrocalcinosis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 6, 2015",15,"I was put on Thiazide 25mg for severe life long  Nephrocalcinosis (kidney stone disease).I have been on it 6 weeks.Yes it cut my urine calcium in half which is great and what we wanted but I have had some terrible side effects:Daily migraines and new acne daily on jaw line (never had acne until I started this medication).It lowered my potassium levels causing lethargy and muscle weakness.Took a 2 day break and instant stop of headaches and no new pimples for 2 days.Have gone back on it today but only taken 12.5mg to see if it makes a difference, only time will tell if I get a headache soon and then I will know for sure it is the tablet causing it.",Nephromum
4,Hydrochlorothiazide,Nephrocalcinosis,6.0,,"May 30, 2011",34,"I was put on hydrochlorothiazide by my urologist for the prevention of kidney stones. I was a regular producer of a stone every 12-18 months prior to starting hydrochlorothiazide. It has been 5 years and counting without a kidney stone. That's the up side. The down side is after about 6 months on this medication I had my first bout with gout. Ever since then I regularly have to deal with gout about every other month. I feel like I traded one type of severe, less often pain for a lower, more recurring pain.",Anonymous
5,Hydrochlorothiazide,Nephrocalcinosis,,,"October 23, 2010",15,My husband was first put on Diovan HCT for blood pressure problems. He had extremely frequent kidney stones to which we tried everything! It wasn't until he started on Diovan HCT that the stones got less and less frequent. It was the HCT in the medicines that helped.,stoner' wife
