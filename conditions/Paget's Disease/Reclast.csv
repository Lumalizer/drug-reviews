0,Reclast,Paget's Disease,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 23, 2021",1,I received the Reclast at 3pm. At midnight I woke up freezing. It felt like I was in a tub of ice. Took 2 hours to warm up. When I coughed I had pain all over my chest and stomach. I had THC in my system. Smoking a joint made me extremely dizzy. I’ve smoked for 50 years and never felt dizzy. It is 8 months later and it’s still happening. This drug interacts with THC. Beware!,Paget
1,Reclast,Paget's Disease,8.0,,"January 30, 2020",10,"Diagnosed with Pagets Disease in October 2019 after tumor on my spine. I am a breast cancer survivor of 12 years. I had 10 radiation treatments to shrink tumor and was eventually diagnosed with Pagets. I didn’t seem to have any side effects listed by most, but I  have mild lymphedema from a mastectomy, which never bothered me much, just occasionally. Since the reclast  infusion in December my shoulder and arm aches constantly and is staying swollen. I can only attribute it to the reclast since a I’ve not had a problem like this since my mastectomy in 2009.BE SURE TO TAKE YOUR CALCIUM AND VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENT. I failed to do so immediately following the infusion for a couple of weeks because I misunderstood  my Dr. and  I ached horribly and got painful ulcers in my mouth. This cleared up after I got those supplements in my body. After reading all these lingering, aching side effects I wondered if everyone realized the importance of these supplements being taken everyday.",Jenn
