0,Clonazepam,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 22, 2021",0,"This medication was prescribed by my TMJ doctor.  I took it for a year and it went fairly well but after looking at all the long-term side effects of taking this drug, I decided to stop. I had significant withdrawal symptoms even though I tapered off slowly. Iâ€™ve been completely off of it for twp years. I have found that Amitriptyline at 10mg  taken at night works best when needed.  At least it does for me. Plus it has much less possible side effects.",Tommy
1,Clonazepam,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 28, 2021",2,"After suffering bell's palsy and then after 8 dental surgeries, neck pain, serve migraines, over 10 years and 900 injections, pain medication for years then I began to developed the worst jaw pain I have every had in my life I could not eat for 8 months begged every dentist and doctor I could find to help me. It was a joke to try to get help. I was suicidal, then I finally found a Doctor that cared - most of them don't anymore. After me doing my own research and reading about the the drug Clonazepam for burning mouth syndrome which I also suffered from I begged and I mean begged him to prescribe clonazepan, yes I know the risks of withdrawals but it worked and its lessened the pain by 80% I could eat soft foods the burning mouth went away. So far it has saved my life but we will see the long term effects but if I every have to go back to that pain I am done.",Debbie

3,Clonazepam,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 10, 2018",7,"I had TMJD (temporomandibular joint disorder) with tinnitus that started at the same time, so the pain and symptoms of both seem intertwined to me. Both improved very soon after starting clonazepam and seemed to continue to improve for 8 yrs. until another infection seemed to make them both worse again. I had reduced the medication from 1 tablet twice per day to one per day. My doctor was surprised to learn that I stopped the night medication as sleeping was the main reason for prescribing it 8 yrs. ago, but after sleeping was not a problem, I kept the morning dose to help squelch the symptoms so I could concentrate. I think it's not working any more, but I tried stopping it without help of my physician and apparently got a severe side effect from it, so I have to wait to discontinue.",UUMom
4,Clonazepam,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 7, 2017",9,"After a car accident, I was prescribed this medication for TMJ which existed before the accident but grew significantly worse. I also experience anxiety and racing thoughts that prevent me from getting sleep. This medication has helped tremendously although I'm not able to take it every night. This can cause you to develop a tolerance.",7nywh3r3
