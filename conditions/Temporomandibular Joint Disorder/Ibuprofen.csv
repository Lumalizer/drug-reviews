0,Ibuprofen,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,8,,"September 25, 2016",13,"Wow. Started to get some major symptoms of TMJ this morning. I've never had to deal with it until today. The ibuprofen (Advil) did an amazing job at reducing the pain and discomfort. Granted, any medication that deals with TMJ helps temporarily and the root cause will need to be addressed. I believe that since my night guard got bent slightly and that I grind my teeth, the possible change in bite with the night-guard and overall grinding contributed. Having the dentist readjust my mouth guard should help do the job. A warm compress also helped me as well.",thebrogo
