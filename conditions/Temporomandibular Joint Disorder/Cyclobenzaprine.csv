0,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 20, 2021",4,"I've been on Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine) for years for tourette syndrome and TMJ . It's a skeleton muscle relaxer and does the job it says it does but to the degree of how well it works ,depends on the case. In my case my TMJ is stress-induced and also has been induced from motor tics from the tourette syndrome and one of them happened to be clenching my mouth very tight as a child. So advanced TMJ like mine isn't going to be cured from a muscle relaxer.  Yes it does make you tired and at night, help ease the pain a little  when it starts traveling up into my head and ear and overall makes the face relaxed and droop a bit for some more  comfort take with a pain reliever like acetaminophen or I prefer NSAID naproxen.",Kc
1,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,3.0,,"June 27, 2019",8,"Was prescribed this medication cyclobenzaprine for my jaw pain, doesn’t really help  with the pain much, but puts you to sleep. Makes you extremely groggy and tired in the morning... I would not recommend this drug waste of money!",Anonymous
2,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 13, 2019",4,"This drug was prescribed for TMJ clenching. It took 3 days to begin working. Though it did help with the jaw tightness and clenching, it caused major problems with my heart. It caused an irregular heartbeat and chest pain. I needed to see a cardiologist for an echocardiogram. Luckily it was normal. I will not take this horrible drug again. The heart issues are not discussed but versions serious.",Micah
3,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 7, 2019",3,My doctor prescribed this to me for jaw pain and it worked at first but is now doing nothing. I’ve even taken the max dose and it doesn’t help at all. Going to see if she will prescribe something else.,Sammygirl
4,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,10.0,,"November 3, 2017",26,"It has helped me so much. I wake up with locked jaw and the nightguard doesn't do anything for me. It does make me sleepy, so I usually only take one at night when my jaw starts to hurt. Usually after 3 nights of takings it my pain and the lock jaw goes away for months .. no side effects. My TMJ is horrible this has been the only relief I've  had.",Sophia B
5,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 25, 2017",16,"This medication made my mood severely down and I was only on it for four days. I have depression/anxiety, but my meds for that work well, and the episode came on extremely suddenly, with no warning. Thank God I googled side-effects or I would have kept taking it. I stopped taking it and began feeling better just hours later. Two days after my last dose, I felt completely normal. This seems consistent with its half-life.I never write medication reviews because usually my side-effects are minor, if they exist at all, but I couldn't in good conscience not warn people about this. Be very careful with it, watch your mood level, talk to people if you're feeling super down, get help. My dentist prescribed it for Temporomandibular Joint Disorder while I was waiting on a night guard. I would rather have TMJ.",Reviewer9000
6,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,9.0,,"May 26, 2017",22,"I took this when my jaw and face muscles were hurting, and Advil itself was not taking it away completely. I took this with 400MG of Ibuprofen, went to sleep, and woke up and the pain was completely gone. It did give me weird dreams, but it's worth it to me to get rid of the pain finally.It also makes me tired, so I only would take it at night, or when I know I don't have to drive or do anything for the rest of the day.",Thankful that this helped
7,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 8, 2016",24,"I was given this medicine when I woke up and my jaw was locked shut. I have TMJ issues and this was the second time it has happened. The first time I was given Robaxin and I had an allergic reaction. Regardless of the allergic reaction (hives) I feel like cyclonenzapine works way better than Robaxin. 45 min after taking it I was able to open my jaw and eat! I'm not sure if it is helping with the pain because I am taking it with hydrocodone 5/300 but it is doing wonders allowing my jaw to open!!! Defiantly recommend this over Robaxin! Also, it makes me tired. Can't drive on it but I don't get so tired that I have to sleep. I can still get stuff done but I wouldn't risk driving!!! Zero side effects besides drowsiness A++",StephDub
8,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 8, 2015",27,"It's not a miracle cure, but it definitely helps.  First time I was prescribed it, my jaw had been locked for a little over three weeks.  Needless to say, I was pretty desperate to have any kind of fix.  After yet another failed appointment with the TMJ specialists, I went to my primary doctor hoping that she had been able to find something new.  This time, she prescribed Cyclobenzaprine.  No joke, four hours later I could open my jaw.  Works like a charm.  The pain goes away with it too (no more tension).  Only downside, is it makes me sleepy and a little loopy.  No driving on this stuff (for me anyways).",Tobyana
9,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,3.0,,"September 16, 2015",10,I was prescribed flexeril to take at night before bed for my TMJ  as I usually wake up in the morning with my jaw way out of place due to clenching and grinding plus my TMJ on top of that. I gave a 3/10 because it was only effective the first night I took it. Any other time after it never worked again. I  even tried taking 2 and still nothing happened.,Court Court
10,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,8.0,,"February 4, 2015",25,"I have an unusual type of Tempro Mandibular Joint Disorder that doesn't cause much joint pain, but limits my jaw movement and causes a lot of facial tension/muscle soreness and headaches. I was prescribed Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine) with the knowledge that it would not help my primary symptom (limited jaw range) since this was caused by a joint problem, not a muscle one. However, taking cyclobenzaprine significantly reduced my facial tension and headaches, so I definitely found that this medicine helped my TMJ. It might not help, but it's definitely worth a try if your doctor suggests it. I also found side effects to be very minimal.",Sophie626
11,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,4.0,,"November 12, 2013",18,I was given Flexeril to take at bedtime for TMJ morning headaches and ear pain. I cannot tell if it helps because I have nightmares when I take it. The dreams are so very vivid...,harveykay
12,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,10.0,,"February 13, 2011",55,"Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine):After struggling with Temporomandibular Joint Disorder for years, seeing so many dentists and doctors, I have finally gotten it under control with Flexeril. My doctor finally diagnosed it as muscle spasms and tension from my anxiety disorder. I take Buspar also, and the combination has been a miracle cure for me. I no longer need pain medicines stronger than OTC. I feel so much better.",TMJ cure
13,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,9.0,,"December 11, 2010",59,"Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine):This medicine helps ease the pain, discomfort of temporomandibular Joint Disorder associated with these symptoms for me. Tightness in jaw and neck, pain in jaw and neck down to shoulder. Also helps with other symptoms for me that seem to be like fibromyalgia symptoms. I give this medicine a high score. I have no side effects, except that it makes me very sleepy. I take this medicine at night before bed as it knocks me out about 1.5 hours after taking it. I can not take it during the day as I would not be able to function without falling asleep, that is the only bad thing. Sometime only a half of the pill is needed and for others the whole pill. I stay sleeping all night long without any interruptions of discomfort or pain.",Anonymous
14,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,4.0,,"April 3, 2010",19,"Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine):Helps me sleep, but I don't notice much relaxing of the jaw muscles. I only take 10mg as I don't like pills, so maybe that is why (says I can take up to 20mg). I haven't felt some of what others have said in previous reviews.",Anonymous
15,Cyclobenzaprine,Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,7.0,,"May 20, 2009",23,"Helps relax muscles while I sleep so I don't clench my teeth and wake up with pain. Unfortunately, leaves me feeling off balance and hung over the next morning. I'm going to talk to my doctor about lowering the dose to see if it is still effective.",Anonymous
