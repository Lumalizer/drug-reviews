0,Donepezil,Mild Cognitive Impairment,7.0,,"January 17, 2022",0,"My husband started taking it for what the Dr. diagnosed as dementia in a 30 min meeting.  He actually feels he is more alert and thinks more clearly.  I have noticed it, too, but mild memory loss remains.I read someone said the doctor notified DMV.  This happened to us as well , without us knowing until a letter arrived.  Also testing by a neuropsychologist diagnosed MCI  later.  A warning to talk with Dr. before proceeding with a psychiatrist.The side effects seem minimal--some leg cramping during day.  He is taking 5 mg. at bedtime.",Quietbear

2,Donepezil,Mild Cognitive Impairment,1.0,,"February 28, 2021",7,Awful pills my dad took them for 4 days after which we knew he couldn't continue with them.  He was so out of it stumbling around without his glasses on and he is nowhere near as bad normally.  He forget things now and again but this made him much worse.,John
3,Donepezil,Mild Cognitive Impairment,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 23, 2020",15,"I have bipolar disorder and am 50 years old. I noticed I had zero recall, disorientation, and difficult with words. My family doc sent me to a Neuro where I got extensive testing. I was diagnosed with ADHD and CMI so I started with 5mg dose of donepezi and noticed a huge difference within 2-3 weeks. I had some mild leg cramping and diarrhea. After 2 months and a Neuro visit we increased to 10mg. I have been on it for one month. I do not notice any difference except now I am having dreams, I haven’t had a dream in over a year, and they may not be pleasant. I talk to Neuro in another month but so far this medicine is great.",Lizzy
4,Donepezil,Mild Cognitive Impairment,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 9, 2019",27,"I was prescribed this medication for memory loss and overall cognitive functioning. I am only 43, but I have bipolar disorder and my tranquilizing meds were ruining my mental capacity. I read it takes a few months to work, but I’ve been on this 2 weeks and can see a real improvement. I feel so much sharper and have been able to retain and recall information more easily. It doesn’t ‘hurt my brain’ to think anymore. Side effects have included an increased thirst and occasionally mild stomach cramping. I’m on a lot of meds that all have side effects so this isn’t an issue for me.",Sunnydale
5,Donepezil,Mild Cognitive Impairment,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 26, 2019",26,"I am 71.  No functional impairment, but with a family history of, not dementia, but short term memory loss.  Went to a ""memory clinic"" to see if there was anything I could/should do to guard against my mother's fate.  They prescribed donepezil 10MG for ""mild dementia"" and notified the DMV.  Driving history: no moving violations and no collisions, not even a bump -- but hey. When I inquired why? the MD said they notify the DMV of EVERY prescription of donepezil. Maybe this is the law, but be forewarned.  PS:  am I getting any benefit?  Hard to know, since I didn't have any issues, was looking for **preventive** measures available. OTOH no neg effects, either.",berta59463
6,Donepezil,Mild Cognitive Impairment,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2019",19,"I had TBI (traumatic brain injury) and have had worse and worse time getting along in doing daily things, this medication does help some. It is much better than nothing at all. I know that depending on what other medications and conditions that serious side effects can happen. I have asthma and COPD, but know how to treat that with various medications. Rescue inhaler is not enough, but have other medications that are quite effective including Combivent. There are many interactions, and I have been told by others that even genetics can cause adverse reactions with this medication. So far the worst thing has been headaches, and with this it is important to pay attention to the drug interactions to avoid problems. The other thing that I like about this medication is the cost, as unlike some of the other medications this is very inexpensive.",Anonymous
7,Donepezil,Mild Cognitive Impairment,,,"February 20, 2019",30,"My boyfriend who is active, working hard, last generation of French canadian lumberjacks, during his annual physical  told doctor about  mild memory laps,  probably age related, doctor diagnosed him immediately  with dementia and gave this terror drug. My boyfriend took 10 mg twice at breakfast,  he got sicker  and sicker,  he could not function, threw up, it felt like they messed with his head.  Also he was nauseous, light headed etc. We went to ER, thanks goodness, they said adverse reaction, plenty of fluid to pee it out, but he is still not well.  So he switched doctors  immediately, it could have cost him life. Folks, be careful out there, there are alternatives.  Check holistic doctors. Doctors get paid to give meds.",marushka
8,Donepezil,Mild Cognitive Impairment,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 13, 2018",25,"I am lucky to have survived this medication.  The prescribing doctor did not bother to research drug reactions and left me on Trazadone for insomnia.  I realized there was a problem, but only lowered Trazadone from 300 mg to 100 mg because of intense insomnia.  I was in the nuthouse 3 times on this drug, and no one questioned Aricept as the cause.  I was taken off Aricept in May of 2017 for muscle spasms and have been fine ever since.",crwriter
9,Donepezil,Mild Cognitive Impairment,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 6, 2018",23,"My husband has been on Aricept 5 mg nightly for about 6 weeks for memory loss related to anesthesia during past surgery. He has not felt well since he started. He has cramps in his feet at night, profuse sweating, fatigue and weakness. Lightheaded when he stands and passed out and had a siezure 2 days ago. His memory loss and anxiety actually got worse on the med. I took him off the med today and contacted the doctor who agrees with my decision. We will wait now and see if he improves. It’s very frightening what these meds can do to your physical and mental well being",Geeg

Asked my physician to let me try Aricept (donepezil)..  Started on the 5mg for one week then 10mg a day for one week then 10mg twice a day.

19,Donepezil,Mild Cognitive Impairment,,,"November 12, 2014",75,"Husband diagnosed 1/2014 at age 57. Put on donepezil at that time.  Doesn't seem to have made much of a difference for him. His memory is not the issue as much, he has problems with judgement, spatial, sequencing, and vision.  When first prescribed he was taking at night and had vivid dreams. He rather enjoyed them as most included friends family from years ago. Dr instructed he take the medicines in the morning as to not interrupt his sleep.  The medicines also cause diarrhea.  Modifying diet to try to compensate.  Want to stay on the medicine in hopes of slower decline.",Anonymous

23,Donepezil,Mild Cognitive Impairment,10.0,,"December 21, 2008",90,"As a result of exposure to pesticide and living with depression (on & off for years), I began to have problems with memory, concentration, distractibility and constantly losing and misplacing things. After much testing, Alzeihmers was ruled out and my diagnosis is Mild Cognitive Impairment. Aricept helped immensely. I still contend with the above problems, except to a much lesser degree than before I started taking Aricept. After about 8-months, the medicine seemed a little less effective but it still keeps me functioning.",elkojohn
