0,Xarelto,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 6, 2021",6,"I have been on it for 2 years and have started having irregular heart beats, sore joints, dizziness, tiredness to the point that I don't even want to get out of my chair and a lot of other side effects. I am working to get off this drug I don't like what it is doing to me.",Naomi
1,Xarelto,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,2.0,,"August 10, 2020",9,"I started taking Warfarin and took it for 12 months.  Then I switched to Xarelto and took it for about 10 months.  This summer as temperature hot more hot I started having major rashes kind of like Jock Itch.  I felt like a dog scratching non stop.  I thought it was my water filter, the detergent, my underwear, you name it.  I purchased medication, changed my clothing.  The Xarelto was causing these big painful pimples around my crotch area.  After doing all that I figured it was Xarelto causing this.  I experienced terrible symptoms for about three months.  Sure it was, right after I stopped taking Xarelto a week later all the itching was completely gone!  Thank God!  Second side effects I started feeling:  Lots of joint pain in my wrists and knees.  Don't trust these newer medications I'm just going back to Warfarin.  Is simply safe and reliable It has been for a long time from what I've been told.  Why fix what's not broken.",Mister M

3,Xarelto,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,8.0,,"July 19, 2019",19,I have had no problems at all on Xarelto.  I have been taking it for  3 and a half years and I will have to take it for the rest of my life.  I love that I do not have to have the regular blood tests anymore.PS the only thing is that is not cover by all medical plans.,ME
4,Xarelto,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 9, 2016",10,"Put on xarelto 15 mg twice a day for thrombosis in left arm. First week was awful. I was dizzy and light headed, especially within an hour of taking the medicine. My doctor did warn me I had to take with food and the same times every day. After a week, I am not feeling lightheaded. I do however have joint pain, especially in my hands. My joints hurt a lot once I wake in the morning. Have to take for another week twice per day then will be put on 20 mg once a day. Give it some time to work.","Mac, 34 Female"
5,Xarelto,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,2.0,,"July 13, 2016",25,"I've only been on it 6 weeks. If you're going to let a Doctor prescribe this for you, make sure your doctor is going to be there through all of the side effects that come with it. I had to replace my first vascular surgeon already because he didn't care at all that my periods were now 16 days long. This drug may cause me to have another surgery to have an IUD put in to stop my periods completely. The claims on their website that this drug does not interact with food is untrue. There are complications just like being on the older medications. Find a doctor who knows everything about this drug before agreeing to be on it!",MattJen
6,Xarelto,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 28, 2016",21,"I had been taking warfarin for many years  for Antiphospholipid syndrome and been pestering my Dr. if I could switch to Xarelto instead, as I'd had enough of the constant INR tests. Finally, my haematologist agreed. (The drug is not normally prescribed for my condition.) I was given 20mg to be taken once daily with breakfast. The first two weeks passed with no problems, but on the third week, I had a really bad dizzy spell and almost fainted. Fortunately, I managed to sit down before I did faint. I spoke to my haematologist and she suggested that I take it just before going to bed instead of the morning. So far it's worked. With my condition, migraines are a symptom and they have got slightly worse since taking Xarelto. But I still much prefer it to warfarin & INR tests!",fizzypop
7,Xarelto,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 8, 2016",7,can't take nsaids for gout and inflamation,no side effects
8,Xarelto,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 1, 2014",26,Xarelto should never be prescribed to anyone with a bleeding disorder. It will cause severe bleeding that in my situation required spending a night in the ER and required that I be taken off this medication immediately.,Quinteman
