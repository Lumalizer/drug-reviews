0,Lovenox,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 18, 2019",4,"My son had cancer and a chemo treatment. It caused blood clots. He was put on these injections. He had a stroke and because he was taking these injections he could not have the stroke buster meds. He died 4 weeks later from another stroke. He was diagnosed on Nov. 7, 2011 AND died on Dec. 31, 2011. I know he could have had a better chance to live a little longer if he had been on oral blood thinners, then he could have at least been given the chance to have the stoke busting drug.",Fed up
1,Lovenox,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 29, 2014",10,"I have Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin Mutation, Protein C Deficiency. Injected twice-daily, subcutaneously while pregnant. Injections were taken in the abdominal area, twice daily, for the duration of pregnancy. Regular treatments were warfarin (Coumadin) while not pregnant. Needles were not very big, but left a lot of bruising because of the thin blood, but that is to be expected with any blood thinner injection. Last month of pregnancy I used heparin injections, I was told they leave the body faster than Lovenox. Just in case of spontaneous labor.",TheSinkMonster
