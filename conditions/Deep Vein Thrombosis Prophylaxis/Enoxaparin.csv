0,Enoxaparin,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 18, 2019",4,"Lovenox (enoxaparin):My son had cancer and a chemo treatment. It caused blood clots. He was put on these injections. He had a stroke and because he was taking these injections he could not have the stroke buster meds. He died 4 weeks later from another stroke. He was diagnosed on Nov. 7, 2011 AND died on Dec. 31, 2011. I know he could have had a better chance to live a little longer if he had been on oral blood thinners, then he could have at least been given the chance to have the stoke busting drug.",Fed up
1,Enoxaparin,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 5, 2019",3,The enoxaparin medication worked fine .  The problem was with the injector!  I had to be on this drug for 14 days and 4 of the injectors misfired the safety cylinder rendering the access to the med. impossible.  This caused me to have to purchase 4 additional syringes at a cost of $58.04 co-pay on my insurance.  When I called the listed complaint line I was unable to even get connected to a human being to ask for assistance.  Can I get a refund for the faulty syringes?,Stogie
2,Enoxaparin,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 29, 2014",10,"Lovenox (enoxaparin):I have Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin Mutation, Protein C Deficiency. Injected twice-daily, subcutaneously while pregnant. Injections were taken in the abdominal area, twice daily, for the duration of pregnancy. Regular treatments were warfarin (Coumadin) while not pregnant. Needles were not very big, but left a lot of bruising because of the thin blood, but that is to be expected with any blood thinner injection. Last month of pregnancy I used heparin injections, I was told they leave the body faster than Lovenox. Just in case of spontaneous labor.",TheSinkMonster
