1,Pradaxa,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,2,,"March 28, 2017",16,"This drug had an very unpleasant side effect noticeable four days after my operation for a total hip replacement. First I had burning in the esophagus and stomach, followed by soreness around my mouth and lips, then burning spread to my back from my stomach.  Six days after the operation, I went out to eat, put an olive into my mouth - the experience was like throwing a match into a lighted fire.  Literally, my esophagus felt like it was on fire.  Doctor recommended taking Omeprazole.  Four days later, it was making no difference, I was being kept awake half the night with the burning.   I told my doctor I must stop Pradaxa (Dabagitran) - she prescribed Apixaban instead.Burning reduced 1 day later, still sore inside, hope nothing lasting",lucySomm
