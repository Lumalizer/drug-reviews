1,Apixaban,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 6, 2020",24,"Eliquis (apixaban):I'm a 51 year old white, female, who had an ER visit after 2 weeks of calf pain that got unbearable. A sonogram showed 2 DVT's in my calf, and I've never had any previous issues with blood clots, DVT's, heart, or valve/artery issues. They couldn't really figure out what caused them, as I'm evidently a very low risk subject. I've been home, and on Eliquis for 4 days now, with no side effects at all, other than being scared to death of others experiences with side effects. My swelling has gone down, my leg pain feels 100% better, and I can walk again. Prayers for everyone!",Melody
2,Apixaban,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 22, 2020",31,"Eliquis (apixaban):I had back surgery March 17. 2020.  I started having a lot of pain in my right calf area. I was told it was probably  a blood clot due  to back surgery, but the surgeon set up an ultrasound later that same day. Started Eliquis the next day. 5 mg x 2 times daily. I was on Eliquis for 3 months.  After the first week took only one 5 mg. The blood clot had dissolved. About the second week taking Eliquis, I developed a dark brown tongue, stomach issues and very weak.    Still to this day I have pain in my stomach. Vomiting and belching. I have had several Doctors visits as well as ER visits and still to this day feel like crap. Next have to go to gastroenterologist. The money I have spent is unreal. My advice is to stay away from this stuff.",Anonymous
3,Apixaban,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 25, 2019",43,Eliquis (apixaban):I am totally blind in one eye due to taking Eliquis.  My case is so bad the drs. at Emory have never seen one this bad and don't know what to do.   I have lost weight and don't eat.  I have a very severe headache as well.  This is no life for anyone.  I have not been outside the house for the last month except to go to the dr.  I have seen the drs. quite a few times during the last 30 days.  They are just trying to keep me comfortable.,SL
4,Apixaban,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 2, 2018",21,"Eliquis (apixaban):Water weight gain and renal failure because of the medication required to control the water retention.  I gained over 50 pounds, went from a 34"" waist to a 44"" waist in the first year.  A gout condition ensued as well. And it appears that I also got a kidney stone (not verified) which was so painful and lasted 70 days. After being off Eliquis, my weight has gradually dropped about 1/2 the weight with water retention medication been reduced.",flattop3

6,Apixaban,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,6.0,,"March 5, 2018",23,"Eliquis (apixaban):I had been on Warfarin for 20 years, and would occasionally get clots which came up from my legs, and while painful for a day or two, the Warfarin would  eat them up, I was instructed not to inform the doctor if they were just small and painful, because I was therapeutic and there was nothing they could do for me at the hospital. If they were large enough, off to the catheterization lab, of course-. Eliquis does not eat them up. I have had a small clot for over two weeks now, and it's not going away. Not only that, but the circulation in my left leg has been set back a decade from switching to it; my blood is nice and thin, I bleed readily enough, but Eliquis is no match for Warfarin when it comes to old growth stuff. As a preventative, I bet it works great, but it is not for my rare case.",Joey
7,Apixaban,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,,,"September 28, 2017",61,"Eliquis (apixaban):Anyone who takes this drug should have their head examined. I plan to file a lawsuit for what this medicine did to me. Nausea, headache, bruising, stiff painful joints, bleeding and fatigue. You name it this drug will do it to you. I quit this drug and  any doctor who suggests taking it again will get dismissed by me",Septson9
8,Apixaban,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis,4.0,,"July 7, 2016",48,"Eliquis (apixaban):I am 30 years old and was placed on eliquis 5mg twice daily after a venogram with stenting in my left groin.  Since I've been on eliquis, it's done it's job as far as thinning m blood, but I've also had some really nasty side effects from it.  I have been bleeding vaginally for 16 days (was on my period when I started the medication and haven't stopped bleeding), I am diabetic and take multiple injections daily so I look like someone has beat me up, I'm constantly nauseated, have no appetite, no energy, heart palpitations at times, cold all the time, night sweats,  and pink tinged urine.  I'm waiting on a call back from the Dr to see about lowering the dose or change going the medication all together.",Sick to my stomach
