My short term memory is decimated. I jump when people recognize me in the street because I'm too slow to talk. These effects came thru slowly, I forgot it was even likely to be the drug until I looked again at the side effects. I was in excellent health otherwise, bar the odd depressive spell, never the type to be the 20% who suffer side effects. I find it hard to believe its only 20%, and the effects are far more severe than I could have imagined.

Used it for 3 years at 1.25mg everyday day and it worked really well at keeping my hair and slowing down the loss but at the expense of killing my libido, memory loss, loss of initiative and drive for life. Wasn't aware that the finasteride could cause this, I was only aware of possible sexual side effects that seemed worth it to keep my hair. It's after stopping the medication that I realized how much better I felt, wasn't even aware of how it affected me during the time I was on it, can't image the nightmare that people must live in thinking this is their new normal.

34,Finasteride,Androgenetic Alopecia,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 25, 2020",7,"Truly not worth it if you value your life and health.Facts:The way that finasteride works is by changing our sex hormones (DHT) and even though we tend to think of our sex hormones as something that happens to us or like something that causes puberty and hair growth/loss in places that we don’t really want, our sex hormones are actually a key part of the signaling machinery that our brain uses to create the experience of being the person that we are. And so when we change our sex hormones, we’re actually changing the version of our brain that we are creating.

I believe it's 100%, see my next point. 2. This is not a drug you can ""try and see how it goes"". First, my side effects came so gradually... ""this must just a natural fluctuation"" ... ""Is it just in my head?"" ... ""Oh wow I'm half impotent now, at age 36, I guess it wasn't in my head"". 2. The side effects do NOT go away after quitting (it's been several years for me) and there is no known cure. 3. What is at stake, besides ""ED"": less desire for your partner affects the affection/quality of your relationships and happiness. The drug damages your brain chemistry/regeneration (hello depression and early Alzheimers). And then of course the fact that sex/masturbation don't bring me all that much pleasure anymore.",Fred

Before taking it I was concerned about permanent penile shrinkage, ED, and watery semen. ED definitely not an issue in the slightest. Penile shrinkage, I don't think so at all, but I'm not positive since I didn't measure before and after. If I thought there was penile shrinkage I would stop. My GF hasn't noticed a difference.

Hopefully it will stabilize and come to a halt. 2)Notice some baby hair along the hairline. (Although I had been using minoxidil 6 months prior to propecia I didn't notice any hair growth until I was on propecia. I am on both propecia and minoxidil now by the way) Not much improvement on the crown. Overall hair volume and quality seem to have improved. Nonetheless it's still too early to tell I guess.3)No side effects so far. I will give another update after a year. I do hope that the hair loss stops for good.,Dylan

I wouldn't think so but looking at photos from a  year ago I recon it's safe to say (I was on the ropes lol, grew my hair out long to compensate). My hair still falls out in the shower, but at a lower rate. I think I must be one of those middle of the road guys, haven't seen too many reviews like that though! Libido still like a stallion, if anything I recon it makes me last longer in bed.

Leave your shampoo about 15 minutes before you rinse it off. I wash my hair twice a week unless it's summer and warm when I was it three times a week. Result? It's growing back, slowly but surely.

I made it to 30 years of age without significant hair loss, but then around the age of 32 it accelerated pretty rapidly. I started the medication at the age of 33 and never looked back. The important thing with this medication is to have realistic expectations. For most people, including myself, ""regrowth"" of hair is either nonexistent or very little. However, if you start it soon after you notice hair loss, it will help you KEEP what hair you HAVE. I've given up on ever having a full head of thick hair, but I have very little loss around the crown, and my receding hairline basically stopped when I started the medication. To the point. . start it SOON after you notice hair loss.",Steve

You may have epidydimits or other problem that needs to be evaluated quickly by the urologist/MD that gave you the Rx. Young people take note. 2)when you are taking a combo drug of finesteride with an alpha blocker such as Flomax (tamsulosin) and you start having side effects such as dizziness, you really don't know which of the two may be causing it. Again, this is a subject that should be discussed with your MD and 3) If your doctor didn't tell you this, I will.
