0,Benztropine,Extrapyramidal Reaction,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 4, 2022",0,I was prescribed benztropine after experiencing quite severe akathisia as result of taking Abilify. I have schizophrenia and the Abilify works wonders for that so I didn't want to swap to another antipsychotic. I was really struggling but benztropine really does take the edge off the adverse effects and helps me to calm down and get back to work. I also suffer from ADHD and so the akathisia really distracted me. I'm happy to be on this combo.,Anonymous

2,Benztropine,Extrapyramidal Reaction,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 1, 2021",3,"Been taking this med  benztropine at 1mg for about three years for EPS - started when I got restless on Abilify, kept it when I switched to Latuda and Prolixin. Honestly, it has been a life saver for extrapyramidal movements. I also have Tardive Dyskinesia which I feel is also helped by the benztropine. No more jutting tongue, spasms, or restlessness. I’m able to take all my meds as directed with this little pill.",Sunguppy
3,Benztropine,Extrapyramidal Reaction,3.0,,"February 28, 2021",3,"I was on this medication for about a week but found that it didn’t help with my jaw clenching it all. It really dried out all parts of me. My throat was always dry, my eyes would become super dry and red and I would have pain behind my eyes. My lips were also incredibly chapped during the time I was on this. Wasn’t ideal",Carolinetruuu

5,Benztropine,Extrapyramidal Reaction,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 26, 2021",4,I've used this medication benztropine for two different occasions of Extrapyramidal Reaction (EPR's).  One was involving Geodon - which was horrific and caused acute cervical dystonia (neck spasms involving horrible cramping and locking up of the muscles where I couldn't move) - and the other was involving Abilify - which was minor and involved restless legs (akathisia).  Cogentin worked well in helping the dystonia from Geodon but it did not stop the akathisia from Abilify.,MissLeopard83

7,Benztropine,Extrapyramidal Reaction,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 7, 2020",10,"I took this new medication with haldol and it freaked me out!  I couldn't sit still  and had about 4mgs or 2 pills I think but they could have been 1mg pills.  Nevertheless within hours of taking it with haldol, I experienced extreme agitation and was literally crawling out of my skin.  Everytime I lied down I had to get back up.  Couldn't sleep and kept walking around with lying down breaks in between.   That's how bad it was.  Felt like I was going to go into cardiac arrest with respiratory depression.  At least that's what it felt like.  Use precaution!  Not taking ever again!",Martin
8,Benztropine,Extrapyramidal Reaction,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 5, 2019",24,"Took this for Extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) caused by a very small dose of abilify  (1 mg) that had me jumping out of my skin and gave me horrible tremors. It helps with the akathesia, but the side effects from the cogentin are just as unbearable. My vision is completely blurred, My mouth is so dry that my throat hurts, I'm getting migraines and I cant remember ANYTHING I did five minutes ago. I don't feel safe driving. I have flushed my abilify down the toilet and the cogentin is about to receive the same fate. Dosage is 0.5 mg twice a day. I only took my nighttime dose last night before bed and fell asleep immediately, it sedated me. I'm so angry about these meds. Done with feeling like a pharmaceutical experiment. I refuse to take them anymore. Hopefully they wear off quickly.",coconuts
9,Benztropine,Extrapyramidal Reaction,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 21, 2019",22,"I recently started taking Benztropine because my Seroquel was adjusted to a higher dosage. For several nights of crying because I was so sleepy but couldn't sleep because I had developedRestless leg syndrome  after  my dose  adjustment. After a week of doing this I called my psych and she prescribed benztropine to me. It took a few days but each night the RLS wasnt as severe as the night before and now I don't have it all. It has  been a blessing but one thing I don't like its giving me blurry vision, brain fog, and just making me loopy lol which I hope will go away soon.",Jes

11,Benztropine,Extrapyramidal Reaction,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 10, 2018",12,"I was on this medication for about 1 week and stopped taking it myself. It gave me more anxiety than I had anticipated. I was on a few other psychotropic meds at the time and couldn't deal with adding another one. I can't attest to whether or not this drug is good for what it is intended for, as I didn't use it for my full prescription.",K-Man-Money
12,Benztropine,Extrapyramidal Reaction,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 2, 2018",19,"I literally took Cogentin for one day (0.5mgs twice a day) and I'm done with it. Was prescribed to help the restlessness and stiff muscles from Rexulti. My anxiety went through the  roof along with throwing me into an awful, scary rage. I felt like I had turned into the female Hulk. Also caused my heart to pound like crazy and, I was shaking from head to toe. Had to take 5mg Zyprexa and 1mg Xanax together to calm me down just enough so I wasn't afraid of really going insane. Was an all around scary experience for me. Of course, this won't happen to everyone...just be careful.",BBP007

17,Benztropine,Extrapyramidal Reaction,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 6, 2016",24,I was prescribed 1mg 2 days ago to help with side effects I was having since increasing my Abilify to 10mg a day. The first day I could tell my restlessness and agitation had decreased by about 90%. Today is the 2nd day and I feel even better! Now I feel like the Abilify is actually working. I did not give 10 stars because I've had two side effects; dry mouth and blurry vision. I'm hoping as my body gets used to this medicine those side effects will dissipate.,amay88

I had excruciating muscle pain, a strange kind of dizziness, brain fog, and restlessness. I thought it could be some presentation of akasthisia. It was unbearable until I started Cogentin. Wonder if those with side effects are prescribed too high of a dose. I'm taking half of the .5 pill three times a day.",BipolarGrrl
