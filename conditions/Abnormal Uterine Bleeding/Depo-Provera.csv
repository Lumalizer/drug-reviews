1,Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 25, 2022",0,Got my first injection in December hoping it would help my bleeding from fibroids and shrink them because my flow was getting heavier. It just made it worse. Bleeding off and on on everyday and taking iron. Hopefully when I get my myomectomy soon it will stop all of this and periods will turn to normal. It's frustrating. Any of you ladies out there going through this I feel you. Do not get the depo provera shot its not worth it. Will not be getting my second injection.,GoFemales
2,Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 14, 2022",0,"I've been on depo before many years ago. I don't remember bleeding for months on end. I got my first injection Jan 7th of 2022 and I've been spotting, heavy bleeding sometimes, clots and it comes out of nowhere. When I think it's stopped NOPE. I have to wear a tampon every day regardless if I'm bleeding or not. 9 out of 10 times I am. My mood has turned to depression and horrid anxiety. I have acne now that I never had before and I just feel unwell. I WILL NOT BE GETTING A SECOND INJECTION!!

3,Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 11, 2022",0,"I have been taking Depo-Provera for well over 10 years. With no bleeding or periods just spotting every once in a while. I’m currently about 3 weeks away from my next shot. I’ve been going crazy because I have been spotting and slightly bleeding for the last 2 weeks.  I thought something was wrong. Like I missed my last shot or I skipped the one due but I’m right on schedule. I am glad I found these posts, because I feel  they have definitely reformulated the shot and I don’t feel alone in this. I’m sure it is due to ingredient restraints but I would have rather been informed than surprised.",Sizzlin_smiles
4,Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 9, 2022",0,"Had depo when I was in high school but stopped; I believe it was due to spotting. Now I’m 28 and needed a reliable BC so I decided to see if my body would react differently to the Depo— I didn’t think it would be worse. I have been bleeding brown and sometimes red blood everyday for over two months. It’s not heavy but the brown blood feels painful…like a burning sensation. My first injection was 11/19/21 and my second was supposed to be between 2/15 & 3/2. I did not get another but am still bleeding on 3/8/22. Will be talking to my doctor about a BC with estrogen to try to reduce the bleeding and cover my contraceptive needs. Been very unhappy with this; like others I got on BC to HAVE safe sex. Also am a smoker, don’t know if that is worsening the bleeding but thought I’d mention.",Zps

6,Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 6, 2022",0,"My cycle has always been predictable, every 28 days, with 4 days of bleeding, 1-1.5 days I’d consider moderate-heavy. I started Depo late Nov 2021 and bled for 4 weeks straight, light to moderate bleeding. I just had my second injection in Feb 2022, and I’m on my 4th week of bleeding, but this time it’s heavy and I pass a lot of clots, which is definitely not normal for me. I’m not planning on continuing with this birth control because bleeding this long is not normal and can lead to iron anemia. Women should report these abnormal symptoms to their Dr’s.",Trilby
7,Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 6, 2022",1,"I've been on Depo-Provera for 7 years and haven't had a period in the last 3 years. However, since 2/14/22, I've been on my period for 19 days straight. I freaked out on the 14th day, messaged my OBGYN and she put me on 1 mg Estradiol (Estrogen) tablets to help ""fluff up"" my uterine lining. She explained, ""Depoprovera thins the lining of the uterus (endometrium) which is why most women don't have periods while on it. Thin lining isn't dangerous. But sometimes if the lining is really thin, then the underlying muscle wall of the uterus bleeds irregularly. So by increasing the estrogen, we can fluff up the lining of the uterus (coat the muscle wall of the uterus) and stop the vaginal bleeding."" Bleeding is now very light and hoping it stops tomorrow, as it will be my last pill. If the bleeding continues, I was told to go in for a gyn exam and/or order a pelvic ultrasound to look at my uterus. She also said,  ""Weight change and stress can effect your period.""",ChristyS.

9,Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 26, 2022",0,"It's great in that it's low maintenance, and for me I only had the regular side effects for about the first two weeks. But a constant my whole time on depo has been daily bleeding, and since getting the last shot it's been worse to the point where TMI I know but I now get clots. That's been the one con especially as it means I bleed during sex (I'm lucky in that my boyfriend is totally okay with it though and not grossed out at all). Judging by other people's experiences on here, especially those who have been on it for several years, I'd guess they've changed something in the shot itself and now we're all suffering the effects of that",Anonymous
10,Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2022",0,"Update on my comment below. Depo didn't work for me. I experienced VERY HEAVY BLEEDING with clots. Our bodies are all different and the medication /dosage required is different. I have now switched to EVRA birth control patch & it is working perfectly for me. I no longer require tranexamic acid. Just glad and grateful to God for these inventions, and that I was able to locate something that works for me. I have read several reports on faliures and complications of Endometrial ablation and Hysterectomy. I would advise ladies to do their research & be very cautious with such risky proceedures even if Doctors suggest it.It's difficult to be patient when you feel like you're under pressure or even bleeding and Anemic. I suggest prayer, calmness & research. Don't rush into procedure or surgery. Removing your uterus or other parts from your body can cause further complications - this has happened to several people. And once you go that route you can't undo your action. Cheers!",Christie_O
11,Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2022",1,"We are done having kids. Over 9 years, I have tried several different IUDs and pills, but results were unsatisfactory overall. I came off the pill and took the Depo Provera shot one week ago. My primary goal was to reduce period bleeding and I was prepared to wait through spotting. However, Depo didn't work for me. I experienced VERY HEAVY BLEEDING with clots. I was prescribed tranexamic acid which has reduced the bleeding on day 1. I plan to take 2 pills daily for 8 days , and hopefully the bleeding will stop. Otherwise, I'll keep using tranex to manage symptoms till my 3 months on Depo expire.I will not be taking another Depo  shot. I'm happy to manage my periods with tranexamic acid alone. I didn't try tranex acid while on the pill as I was advised of risk of increased clots. I'm so grateful to God for the invention of tranexamic acid and expect to live my life freely from here on now using it. I also considered ablation or a hysterectomy but decided neither was worth the risk!",Christie O

15,Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 15, 2022",0,I've been on this shot now for 13 years haven't missed an injection and always get it on day 1 or 2 in my window. I occasionally would get break through bleeding a day or two before my next shot. Nothing serious just inconvenient to light for a tampon too much for a liner type thing. My last shot was in December my window doesn't open for a few weeks and I have had the heaviest period of my life. I started the shot because I got large cysts on my ovaries that were super painful. I hadn't had issues with them or a period in the time I've been on it. Until this time. I don't know what's going on but I hope this isn't the new normal.,Trashpanda

17,Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 14, 2022",1,"So, after I gave birth to my fifth child at age 42, at my postpartum appointment my ob/gyn sold it to me as though I was going spot any way while nursing. I'm angry he didn't tell me I can bleed for 3 months or longer on this injection. Within days I became enraged, I didn't like may newborn at all and could care a less about it (which I have never ever felt until after the shot. I also never felt that way with any of my babies). Not only did I feel enraged, but started spotting within days, lost my sex drive, then went into light bleeding the 2nd week, then 3rd week getting blood clots, now going into my 4th week with huge blood clots. I'm taking iron now. I also have headaches every day. When I looked up reviews with this depo shot, I was crying almost every day and beating myself up for taking this shot. This stupid drug has jacked up my sex life with my husband and I obviously have no desire to have sex on my period with all these blood clots coming out. I will never again take this shot nor recommend it.",Queenofall2000

20,Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 13, 2021",1,"Was given this shot to assist with heavy bleeding during cycle.  Blood tests showed ""severe"" anemia.  Qualified for a blood transfusion, declined.  Did iron infusions instead.  As a longer term solution, agreed to this DEPO shot.  DO NOT DO IT.  No issue when received the shot on November 10th other than very tender knot in my arm for 36 hours.  Expected to have little to no period, since that was the purpose of the shot.  OPPOSITE EFFECT.  All the improvements experienced in gaining in my hemoglobin levels were lost.  Been bleeding since December 1, it's now the 12th.  Not spotting, bleeding.  There was a day in the cycle so intense it was the worst I have ever experienced.  Mood swings, depression, feeling agitated.  This is all in addition to the exhaustion, fatigue, heart racing, light-headedness, etc that comes with the severe anemia. Please get a blood screening if you are having excessive bleeding.  I am learning how dangerous anemia can be.",Ella May

I’ve been on it 16 years have never experienced this annoyance. Its not even healthy to bleed for over 2 weeks plus where I got my shot had a knot there for about 1 month.  This can’t be life I’m not getting any more shots I don’t trust it if it’s not something else then the Depo is outdated most likely.

26,Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 16, 2021",0,I have been on the depo for 14 years now! I got my first shot right after my C-section with my twins. I bled for 2 months then my period completely disappeared. I have seen nothing until a week ago I started having this brown discharge. It’s been a week and still having it. I certainly hope I am not pregnant as my pregnancy with my twins was horrible and they were premature so I have been afraid to get pregnant and then there is my age!! But seeing that so many people are having this issue I’m hoping it’s a bad batch or something instead being pregnant. Although things like this shouldn’t happen and then so many of us start to experience things that we thought have been gone for many years!! Oh and I’m almost at the end of my injection and due the beginning of December. The makers of this need to see all of this and look into this and try to figure out if there’s a bad batch or Inform us if there have been changes in the ingredients!!,Anonymous

I'd get super moody, emotional, and down right irrational at time. I had stopped taking it cause after my youngest was born I had a tubal. I thought that I'd never have to use birth control again. But I was wrong after my tubal I stated experiencing super heavy, long, and irregular periods. When I went to the doctor I was told I could be on the PCOS spectrum. They didn't do any test to confirm. Instead told me I had a few options. Depo, IUD, a pill, or an ablation. After some thought I went with Depo. Past experiences told me I wouldn't have to deal with my super heavy, long, and painful periods any more. Boy was I wrong. 60 days and counting.

I may come off this drug as the only reason I stayed on it was because my periods stopped, I have been single for 13 years now so don't need it for the contraceptive aspect. So glad I found this forum as I was thinking this could be a symptom of cancer and been bit worried. Thanks for sharing your experience.",Long term lady

Didn’t really notice anything else out of the ordinary other than that. In 2020 around June, I decided I was ready to have another child so I told my doctor I wasn’t going to get my next injection scheduled in July 2020. My doctor told me it could take up to 10 months for it to be completely out of my system and for my hormones and whatnot to go back to normal. It’s now been a little over a year, still not pregnant.

89,Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 28, 2021",2,I do not recommend this injection to anyone. I have taken this injection 2 times before with my only side effect the 2nd time of taking it was weight gain. Me and my Dr decide the best thing for me is to get back on the depo injection because I was having painful periods. Well I got on it November 2020. I don't ever remember bleeding on the injection  before but low and behold my 1st week wasn't to bad just a lil spotting. Then the 2nd week heavy bleeding and it kinda stayed like that for the next 5 to 6 weeks. I stopped bleeding I believe for 1 month then I started back again March 5th and have not stopped yet. These last 2 days have been horrible. Heavy bleeding and passing the size of 2 quarters clots.  I have contacted my Dr. and hopefully we can figure out something else because this injection is not for me. But I can't deal with having painful periods that keep me bedridden for 2 days either.,Tm

I have NEVER tried birth control before and I wish I would have read more on depo prevera because I WOULD HAVE NEVER GOTTEN THE SHOT. The first month I was okay but as soon as I got my period I would be on for two weeks and then off for one week. It went from that to being on my period for 5 weeks and 3 days in August then went from that to being off my period only 5-7 days each month. My mood swings have been off the charts I'm EXHAUSTED!!!!

Within only a few days she started to have a heavy period that went on for a little over three weeks. Finally she went to the doctor where they gave her birth control to help stop the period. A couple of weeks ago she arrived at her placebo pills and a heavy period started again, and once again it didn't stop. It is still going on and the doctor insists that it is STILL the result of the depo shot, saying that it may stop after a few more months.A few more months?! Of non-stop heavy bleeding?! That is ridiculous! It's making my mom weak and exhausted; nobody else needs to go through this. Please, use any other method of birth control. It is not worth this amount of pain.",Nellie

It's almost November and I have been spotting every single day since May. I'm due for my third shot in December and I was told it can take up to a year for your hormones to fully regulate. I have some friends who have gone on it and they love it, their periods have stopped completely. It seems to have regulated my mood swings, because I was a basket case before. But the lack of sex drive and the permanent period might be the most annoying part of my life. Thankfully, I have a ridiculously understanding boyfriend. I'm starting to think the whole idea behind it is that if you just bleed a little bit constantly then your uterus is completely uninhabitable for an egg, but also you feel disgusting constantly and never want to have sex, birth control mission accomplished.",Jenny

242,Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 11, 2019",21,Hey ladies.... depo is the worst birth control I ever got. Bleeding non stop after about a month after. However I did some research and there are a couple natural remedies that have really helped.1. Red raspberry leaf tea 3x a day2. Agnus Cactus (Vitex)  (it’s a tincture so I feel it gets absorbed better in your system)3. Dong Quai 3x a day After taking this regimen my bleeding stopped. Of course I got happy and forgot to take them and it comes back but for anyone who’s so sick and tired of bleeding (and not having sex ughhh) give this a try.

I scrolled for hours and found a comment that saved me!!!! If you are continuously bleeding go get some raspberry leaf tea and drink 4 cups of it a day.( I would just permanently the night before put two tea bags in a 16 ounce glass bottle with honey and let sit over night) I took this for two days and the bleeding was still there but very light. However I needed it to stop completely because my boyfriend of a long distance relationship was coming that weekend. So I went on amazon and ordered natural estrogen supplements and took those with the tea every day and the bleeding completely stopped after 4 days and I haven’t bled since.

I suffered a whole year on this medication. I had very bad period cramps and depo caused no cramping at all! But on the other hand I have been bleeding on depo for a year straight every single day. Everyone has different bodies and I understand that but depo made my uterus lining too fragile so I wasn’t able to work out or lift weights without heavy breakthrough bleeding. The doctors didn’t have much to say and just told me to switch to a IUD which I refuse. I’m in a situation now where I can’t get off of it because of my period cramps but I cannot stand this medication making me bleed everyday. It started to hold me back from a lot of activity’s and made me depressed. Please please please don’t let the doctors tell you differently if you have any of these problems.

After two years of 24/7 heavy bleeding with massive two to four inch clots and multiple gynecologists not believing how heavy or constant, I finally found a woman gynecologist who took my condition seriously and found fibroids present. Bleeding was too heavy to get any usable tissue during the biopsy. The other doctors never even sent me for any scans or tests, so her even attempting a biopsy was an improvement. The depo shot she recommended lighted the bleeding, though I still have 24/7 bleeding (after eight months on the shot) and clots. It isn't a miracle shot. The pain from the pressure of things shifting to accommodate a tumor the size of my fist is obviously still there, and it still prevents a tampon from fitting, but at least the severe cramping to where my legs give out doesn't happen any more.

The cost of the pads, diapers plugs whatever you wanna call them is so ridiculous.  I'm now on iron pills and vitamin c   as my iron levels are so low I am borderline for a blood transfusion. A normal count is 12.5 mine is 7.5  - under 7 you need a transfusion. My mood is horrible and its affecting my marriage, my job - hell even strangers. I am not a nice person and its killing me literally.  DO NOT get this shot. It's a real life nightmare that has no end in sight.",Depressed laura
