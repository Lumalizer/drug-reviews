0,Jolivette,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 17, 2017",0,"I had a Swollen uterus with Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS) So I was  started on this.  Since then I’ve begun having a mild headache most of the day, most days. I’ve also had a stomach bug and stomach infection within 3 months of each other. I’ve only had 2 stomach bugs in my 35 years and 0 stomach infections. There have been 2 times I’ve noticed one arm going numb and a few days ago the right side of my body became numb and weak and I was able to move my arm and leg but it took more effort than the left side of my body. It eventually went back to normal. I have noticed my periods are normal again. Before this medicine I would  spot for 3-5 days, have a heavy period for 2 days, a lighter flow for 1-2 days, and then spot for 5-7 days thereafter. During ovulation I would have a thick, brown cervical mucous.",Nature Girl
1,Jolivette,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 4, 2015",17,"Omg, where to begin. Doc had me switch from Yasmin (on for over 15yrs) to Jolivette. I have been on it for 3 years (?). My symptoms have been: weight gain, inability to lose weight (very slow loss) despite 6 day workouts and calorie (low carb) control, hot flashes, night sweats, neck pain, headaches, low energy, terrible depression, insane hostile angry mood swings and constant irritability. I went to the doctor as I thought I might be in early menopause. A battery of tests and blood work came up empty. She dismissed that Jolivette was the cause. Finally, googled it and found countless forums of women in the same boat as me. It's been 3 weeks since I stopped the pill and most notably my moods has been so even no irritability at all!",Helen Back
2,Jolivette,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 26, 2014",23,"I've been using these pills 3 months now. I've had very heavy bleeding for so long that I welcomed a change. The first two months were awesome. My cycle was  very light and lasted the normal five days. No cramping, very little bloating.This third month my cycle came like clockwork lasted five days then two weeks later returned. My breast have been very tender and although very small they feel heavyI'm not giving up yet.",Slym
3,Jolivette,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1.0,,"January 9, 2012",18,I had a non-stop period 3 months ago. The Doctor prescribed Jolivette to let my period stop but after 6 days my bleeding doesn't stop at all. It's annoying because you can feel the gushing of blood. Until I asked my Doctor to switch it into another pill.,swetau
4,Jolivette,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2.0,,"February 19, 2011",16,"Thanks for sharing about the hair loss after several months on the medication.  I had the same experience.  I thought it was helping me with water retention and joint aches but I got carpal tunnel syndrome and had significant hair loss, and I coming to realize it may be from Jolivette.  ",lazygardener
