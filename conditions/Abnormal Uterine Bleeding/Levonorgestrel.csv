0,Levonorgestrel,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 8, 2022",0,Mirena (levonorgestrel):I had the Mirena IUD for just over a year. And while the purpose was to slow and stop my period because it was so painful and I bled so much the unspoken side effects were life altering in the worst way. None of the medical/drug documents mentioned a risk of depression or suicidal depression yet over the next year I progressed in a fast downward spiral until I was thinking suicidal thoughts. I didn’t realize the connection until recently. I finally got the Mirena out because I was getting so crappy with it in and a few months later my depression eased up and I started to function like a normal person. This drug has unknown and VERY harmful side effects. I would never recommend it to any person for any use. Added 1k monthly cost for mental health treatment caused by this product.,Mix

Before Mirena I had unbearable bleeding and period cramps. The first couple of months with Mirena there was a lot of spotting and took a while for my period to go back to normal. The insertion was probably one of the worst pains of my life! However, this will be my 3rd year with Mirena and I like that I can just have it inserted and forget about it. Even though it didn’t completely stop my periods like it said it would, it had definitely made my periods a lot less severe.Also Mirena has worked great as a birth control!

Began to bleed heavily on day 9 (4 days before due period). Heavy bleeding and clotting was relentless, (I’m used to heavy periods, this was a huge amount of clotting), felt depressed and exhausted. The most excruciating camps, on a level with labour pains day 16, lasted intensely for 45 min  and left me numb with pain and unable work. I found it impossible to concentrate and developed tinnitus. Heavy bleed continued for 12 days.

I had mine in for about 6 months for endometriosis. I went on it to better regulated my periods after experiencing spotting with Ashlyna and my cramps. It didn’t help with my cramps. I gained 20 lbs in 6 months with ZERO life style changes. I worked out, I ate less, etc. I swelled up. Online it says hormonal IUD weight gain is uncommon/unlikely, but tell that to me and the hundreds of other women who have gained excessive weight after insertion. I got mine out a week ago and I’ve already lost 5lbs with no lifestyle change. I had to go off it as the weight gain began affecting my self esteem and I couldn’t fit into my jeans anymore. I do like the security it provided in terms of birth control, though. I would get a copper IUD for that except the procedure is so damn painful they thought they perforated my uterus and I had to go to the ER. I don’t recommend this in terms of.. well anything really.

12,Levonorgestrel,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1.0,,"December 22, 2021",0,Mirena (levonorgestrel):I have been on the Mirena IUD two different times. The first time I had it inserted in April 2017. It was in for 3 years the only I issue had then was migraines. Other than that it was amazing my cycle was light and I never had cramps. I had it inserted again this year and I have had nothing but problems. I have spent this entire month alone bleeding. I am also experiencing painful sore breasts and nausea. I have had multiple tests done including a pregnancy test to rule everything out and all of my results have came back negative. I will be getting it removed and will never get it again. From day 1 my body has been rejecting it but I tried to give it a chance. I cannot understand why I did well with it the first time but not now. I am very disappointed.,Jasmine A.

It has been painful at times, almost sharp feeling as if the IUD is poking around in there. I have gone to the doctor and they have checked the IUD and say everything is fine and have zero concern. This is so incredibly frustrating. Tampons are painful when inserted. Having to wear a thick pad for a month straight now is not fun. I’ve had incessant back pain, not extreme but it is present.

I decided to make an appointment to have this procedure done on November 2020. I can say it was the most excruciating pain I have ever encountered. It brought me to tears. Shortly having this done, I bled so bad. A pad at least every hour or less. Cramps were severe as well. I was told that this was normal and it usually takes a year. Some women may experience light to no period at all .I guess those who do must be the lucky ones. Its been a year and my period is all over the place. Spotting and periods that last almost 2 weeks?

My doctor ordered an ultrasound and the Mirena was missing.  On physical exam, it had pierce through my cervix and the tissue had grown around the device.  My doctor had a very hard time removing it.  I was given 8 weeks to heal and we tried again.  I worked in the medical field and knew that sometimes things don’t go well the first time.  So I was willing to give it a decent amount of time.  The second device did not help my periods at all.  Migraines became an issue and anemia was now a problem.

Tons of spotting, every single day since insertion. Not enough to need a tampon or pad, but I almost never wipe or have sex without seeing bleeding. I immediately gained like 15 pounds due to an uncontrollable appetite. My doctor blamed it on being ""progesterone dominant"" which causes a head hunger and usually only shows itself within the first six months.

The pain going in was awful and I had cramping the rest of the day, but that subsided by the next day. However my period became even more irregular. I would bleed for weeks or a month at a time. It would go from heavy to spotting to heavy again, with no rhyme or reason. I never could predict when the next period would come. For 2 years I bled more than I didn't. I waited a year to see if it would even out and it never did. I got it removed just before the 2nd-year mark (would have done it sooner but COVID prevented that).

Cons - Significantly reduced sex drive and the other side effects was oily skin and hair. And for me, extreme hair loss (telogen effluvium = TE). I’m unsure if this was from the Mirena or going off the pill but about 1/3 of my hair fell out. It was all over thinning (not alopecia) with a loss of ~300 hairs p/day.

The first insertion was very painful; my doctor explained that the cervix can tilt and that is why it was painful. Mild discomfort for two or three days and very light spotting in first year or two.  From then on,  no pain or spotting.  Occasionally I have had light spotting after sex.  Subsequent insertions by female doctors were pain free.Having had incredibly heavy, painful periods of 14 days and longer, using tampons and pads at the same time and still having embarrassing leakage having a Mirena is wonderful.  I was anaemic and exhausted most of my time, before Mirena.  Oral contraception made me emotional and I felt so unsettled I came off them after a few months.I haven't had PMT or menstrual cycle associated issues since my sixth month or so with the Mirena.

My doctor recommended placing a Mirena IUD to control post-menopausal bleeding. He implanted the IUD earlier this week. The doctor assured me that placement would not be very painful and that it was a quick and easy procedure.Well, that was nuts! The placement took at least 20 minutes and it was pure nightmare material. My cervix apparently bled during the procedure so the doctor cauterized with silver nitrate which, of course, stung. After placement, I was in constant pain. I could not sleep that night due to the severe pain and called the next day to have it removed.Upon removal, the pain went away almost instantly. Now, however, two days later, I am bleeding rather profusely. This is a nightmare. I would highly discourage any perimenopausal or menopausal woman from considering this therapy.

They sent me for an ultrasound to check for ovarian cysts but was clear.  They found a polyp on my cervix. When they removed the polyp my coil dislodged & was replaced. I started having burning pain in my cervix and a smell. Had a course of antibiotics but the pain stayed. They removed the coil & I was ok for a couple of months. But my periods are extremely heavy with massive clots and severe pain and they fitted another coil. This was  Aug and bleeding for 4 weeks and getting heavier. Also menopausal so unsure if it's the coil or menopause causing the bleeding. I want a hysterectomy but at 47 I'm too young apparently. End of my tether,Lesslee
