0,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 15, 2019",2,"I was placed on Yaz when I was 16 year old  for abnormally long periods and after that Ortho-Tri Cyclin for 3 years, I started to have the most severe and rare adverse effects. It started with water retention and weight gain, then the whites of my eyes got really red and my eyes were so painful that I could barely open my eyes or be out in the light without extreme pain. I went to my eye doctor and she diagnosed me with Scleritis and said that it can blind you and that I am having an autoimmune disorder of some kind and she sent me to an autoimmune doctor. I was checked for every autoimmune disorder known and was negative for everything, then came more side effects. I got bright red nodules all over my legs that were extremely painful. I got vaginal swelling and pain. Also, I had extreme depression and constant feelings of hopelessness. My OBGYN took me off of the Ortho-Tri Cyclin and within 2 weeks, all my symptoms were gone.",Kris

3,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,6.0,,"July 27, 2017",2,"I went on this for heavy bleeding and Pain from Fibroids.I had to get a blood transfusion. It helped the    severe pain in my lower back & stomach.The heavy bleeding not so much! I'm on my 3rd pack, and the first two months had heavy or just bleeding everyday of the month, and still some. Side effects I get are nauseousness a lot more depression, headaches ,upset stomach, gas more.  I think and I read others say they got that too. Idk if the bleeding is breakthru bleeding or my fibroids, but I certainly don't need anymore bleeding. I have Anemia now from bleeding everyday.",Daisy doo
4,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 8, 2017",1,"I started this pill at 18 because I didn't have my period for 6 months. My period came back after the first month. My acne got worse for the first 6 months but eventually got a bit better, no more cystic acne. My appetite skyrocketed but my weight has stayed constant. It's also given me hot flashes. Lots of moodiness and anxiety but that might be unrelated to the pill, and it has improved somewhat. After 15 months I've decided to switch pills. That being said, the pill affects everyone differently so take my experience with a grain of salt.",Anonymous
5,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 21, 2017",8,"While I was on Ortho Tri Cyclen, I was hospitalized. I came very close to needing a blood transfusion. Halfway through a pack, I started to bleed heavily. I went to the ER and had ultrasounds done to be sure I wasn't having a miscarriage or cyst rupture. It was explained to me that the added hormones were not balancing well, which was causing one to crash and cause heavy bleeding. I was immediately taken off of birth control. I won't ever try it again. It was a very scary experience.",Cheree13
6,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 17, 2016",0,"I went through a number of birth control pills and even had the implanon, each one gave me some sort of side effect (mostly horrible mood swings, terrible breakthrough needing and depression)  I started taking this pill a couple months after I had my daughter and it worked great for me.  But as soon as my prescription ran out and I had to wait a few days to get back on schedule, I just kept bleeding.  It's been going on for two weeks now and I'm still bleeding today, IDK what to do about this I'm so frustrated because this has been the only pill that hasn't severely altered my hormones until recently.  Should I continue the usage and wait it out a but longer? Really don't want to be pregnant again.  ",Lillya07
7,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9.0,,"December 12, 2014",13,"Last year or so I was having constant spotting and so I went to the Dr. and was put on different birth control pills, none of which helped with the spotting until this one.  I've had no spotting whatsoever on this one and I've been on it for 9 months or so and my periods only last about 3-4 days which is nice. I've also stopped getting bad cramps which were horrendous prior to birth control. My acne has cleared up expect for the occasional spot but only once a month or so. I have not experienced any weight gain either, however I do notice some slight mood changes but it's nothing that is uncontrollable. I would recommend.",MJade29
