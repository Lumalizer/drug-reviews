0,Junel,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 1, 2021",0,"So I’ve been on it for only a month and I’m going to be honest it’s been a game changer. I’m a person that has been dealing with abnormal uterine bleeding for a while. I also have cervical ectropian. What finally made me decide to try this pill was my doctor suggesting this to make my periods normal. I would spot up to five days before I'd even get my period and bleed occasionally after sex.  Since taking this pill, I did not spot prior to getting my period and it was extremely light (no complaints here about that) I did experience the skin breakout but that wasn’t a biggie for me.  I also have not had bleeding after sex. I know everyone is different but I would recommend this pill.",Jas
1,Junel,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1.0,,"January 11, 2021",1,"The reason I stopped taking it was because I was going on 12 days with menstrual bleeding. After the first 24 hours I had been off the pill, I felt the jittery sensation take over my body. I didn’t know what was wrong with me. I was having suicidal thoughts and random thoughts that have never been inside my head. I thought was being triggered by a past memory until I thought about the pill. I denied it at first and even went and talked to a therapist and told her I was having severe anxiety. My Mom was getting so scared. I told her about the pill and we decided to look it up and came across this website. After reading these comments I felt so much better because I wasn’t alone. What I’m experiencing right is the most scariest thing EVER. My mind is still trying to get right and my body still feels jittery, I’m thinking it because of a withdrawal from the pill. But I wanted to come on here and share my experience as well. This pill is HORRIBLE!",Anonymous
2,Junel,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1.0,,"July 9, 2019",0,I had some mild nausea here and there but nothing serious.  This is not my first time being on the pill so I knew it was the pill causing it.  I always felt though like this pill was a dam holding back the rushing waters of my cycle.  Last week was time for my cycle and the first day no problem (last Tuesday) from Wed on I couldn't leave my house.  The bleeding was so heavy and the clots were so huge and constant I thought something was seriously wrong.  I found myself to be very angry and short tempered at every single thing and person (I am generally a very bubbly person).  I called my doctor on Friday and said this is not the pill for me and to give me something else b/c I can not do another month of this again.  Never have I been in a situation where my bleeding was so heavy I couldn't go out for fear of messing all over myself.  This was with the largest tampon I could buy and the heaviest pad I could get and still it was so much I was going through both about every hour.,ZombieKitten
3,Junel,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 4, 2018",3,"I've been Junel fe 1.5/30 for 3 months and I absolutely hate it. It was prescribed to me in an attempt to shorten the length and heaviness of  my period.  As well as I was recently diagnosed with fibroids. For the 1st month I expected spotting and I was met with heavy bleeding for a whole month. Within the first month I suffered from acne (face and back), anxiety, severe cramps,  depression, raging temper and breast swelling/ pain. The 2nd month I was pleased to see that my period lightened up but during my cycle my period stopped for a few days and resumed. My anxiety and depression continued and new symptoms developed. I noticed a loss of appetite and an aversion to foods I would normally love. Prior to the pill I was a normal active 23 year old with no health issues. Most days when I'm not working, I can barely make it out of bed due to exhaustion and sadness. It's safe to say this pill isn't the one for me.",Sammy18

The fibrioids had  been the cause of pain and prolonged period ( 7months ). Since I had been on microgestin I have had no issues no periods they have stopped and no pain of any kind.  Then when microgestin wasn't available they gave me junel 1/20 fe 1/28. Still hasn't changed, haven't had a period since started taking them.  What I would like to know is I'm 48 yrs old and my gynaecologist said he wanted to keep me on these to get through menopause. So how do I know when I'm going through menopause :))",Tsims
6,Junel,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,4.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 13, 2018",1,"Since I've been on Nortrel 1/35 I've been so sad/depressed/empty. I feel lost and useless and cry a lot. Family and friends have seen the change.  I even began counselling because I couldn't figure out what was so wrong with me, but I knew I couldn't shake the feeling. My boyfriend took the time to quickly search effects after I told him how my mother thought my meds were negatively affecting me. Lo and behold- I'm not the only one! I'm so happy to know I wasn't losing it, and my life doesn't suck- the pills do. What worries me is I'm a healthy woman who is generally always happy, even in the face of issues, AND I HAD A MAJOR DECLINE in personality.  What could possibly happen to a woman who already struggles with feelings of depression and anxiety? I was never screened psychologically prior to being prescribed, or afterwards. Judging by the amount of similar experiences, doctors should ask basic questions prior to prescription. Do not take this medication, unless it is absolutely your only option.",MSJ

It has been a lifesaver for the period part. I have it when I want which my doc says every 81 days. The switch from the one previous to this was AWFUL.

I switched two months ago to Microgestin  1/20 since it’s cheaper than what I was previously on. In terms of contraception, its been perfect. It’s also regulated my periods, which my other pill was not able to do. HOWEVER, after reading a lot of reviews I’m starting to put some pieces together. I had a horrible yeast infection that took forever to get rid of; a problem I’ve never had before. I also have realized my acne got worse lately. I started breaking out across my forehead which is really abnormal for me. In terms of mood, it’s been really bad. Crying, lack of focus, depression, and anxiety.

I've been on this period for a little over a month now. I have had a lot more anxiety, many calf cramps and extreme irritability. It also has barely regulated my period.

I haven't gained any weight and I have even more acne, but I went on estrogen pills before I went on the birth control which might be the cause.

I'm halfway through my second pack and I'm very happy with the results so far. I've never had a regular period before and in comparison to my usual 15-day-long nightmares, a light four days is great! The first few weeks, I noticed some breast tenderness, but that's stopped for the most part. My hormones have been totally put of whack for years and they're finally calming down, it seems. My acne is much less severe than it used to be and I've lost a little bit of weight. I haven't experienced any mood swings either, which I know some users have reported. I had mood swings before Taytulla, but not anymore. I'm quite pleased!",KCC934
15,Junel,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 20, 2017",1,"The only reason why I got on the pill was because I was getting my period every two weeks and I would spot like crazy! After my visit with my OBGYN I started taking the pill. Now I only get my period for 3 days and it's super light!!! The major downfall I had with it was the crazy mood swings! I would get mad at anything and everything, one minute I'd be happy the next one I'd either be mad or sad. The pill did not cause me to gain weight, it actually helped with weight loss. I currently am off of it right now and my mood swings are they same as if I had barely started taking the pill and I haven't gain any weight either.

My past experience trying birth control pills in my 20s and 30s was awful. I never finished a pack due to uncontrollable crying, depression, mood swings, weight gain, exhaustion and bloating. I was told the lower hormone levels in this pill would give me less side effects. I will say I did not gain weight or feel bloated but I experienced nausea and exhaustion to the point I was curled up on the couch every night. Then on only day 12, I woke up and the crying began. I couldn't go to work and then my heart was racing, I felt dizzy and full of anxiety for no reason. I ended up in the ER. anxiety and depression are listed on the label.",Anonymous

But honestly I have gotten constant bleeding and spotting in an unfavorable color. I am trying to wait out till my gyno app next month but I went on this pill for protection but mainly because I was fainting/having awful side effects on my periods and its now recurring at a larger scale.

But my first time around it was GREAT, I had really bad periods prior to starting this pill and lo loestrin caused me to not have one at all. I loved it and my sex life was flourishing with my boyfriend. In April of this year I had to stop taking it because I lost insurance coverage and couldn't afford it at manufactured price, instead I started taking a pill that brought my period back but it was barable. I started back on Lo loestrin in June 2017 and was already on my cycle from the last pill.

My chest is even breaking out. I have bumps all over my forehead and cheeks (I have NEVER had acne on my cheeks) and even starting to come up on my neck. Do NOT take this for acne.

First of all I bled out for over a month on this birth control...not for me. I don't like getting my period a lot. I had severe cramps and was always tired.

The doctors told me it might take 2-3 cycles for it to start working but I am currently on my 3rd period since taking the pills and this time my period is way heavier than my last two and I have awful cramps (I rarely cramped before using this pill). I have anxiety all the time now as I am terrified I might develop a blood clot. I'll give it one more month and then look into other pills I guess. Probably gonna write another review so yeah. Also I'm 18 and my periods have been heavy since I was around 15.

He instructed me to start my pills that following Sunday & every since I started I have been bleeding in between lasting up to 3 to 4 days is this normal? Do I have to continue taking the pills for awhile in order for it to work as it should & give me a normal cycle?

I've had a few headaches, breast tenderness and I spotted once during the last pack. None are HORRIBLE and mimic very very mild PMS. I started taking birth control to control my painful periods, and so far its worked-- my last period was very light and painless. And I've also noticed the side effects have lessened the longer I am on the pill. The pill introduces new hormones in high doses to your body- You can't expect it to just adjust. It takes some time but I believe the longer I'm on the pill, the less I'll feel the side effects. So far, its doing the job I want it to do.",Not unhappy

I don't really want to continue taking it if this is going to continue, the point of going on the pill was to prevent pregnancy but if I'm bleeding all month anyways I don't even have sex- so there's no point.

It stopped my horrible cramps and excessively heavy and long periods in their tracks and gave me my life back. I've never experienced any negative side effects on it.

It did a really terrible job of regulating my periods, because they are crazier now than they were before. The first month, I spotted almost the entire month, but my period was on time, short, and light. When I didn't spot at all the second month, I figured it would be smooth sailing. Nope. My period was really early that month and longer than usual. I either had an extremely early period the third month, or heavy spotting accompanied by bad cramps and no period at all. It didn't effect my sex drive, but it did cause me to have vaginal dryness for about the first six weeks of taking it, although thankfully that side effect did go away after a while. I found myself to be incredibly short tempered after starting this medication, but I think that side effect subsided (ask my friends, I guess haha). I also became alarmed at the amount of hair that was falling out, but a call to the doctor assured me that the hair is falling out faster, but also growing back in faster. I haven't noticed a change in the fullness of my hair, so I'll take her word on it. I have noticed myself having more pimples in the last month, but this could be related to stress, because I hadn't noticed it the first two months.Bottom line, I'm giving it a six, because while it served me well as a birth control and I didn't get pregnant while taking it and most of its side effects subsided for me, it has served me poorly for the reason it was prescribed, to regulate my period.",Shurrydan

I was nauseous, restless, foggy mind, sad and emotionless and I wouldn't have thought it was the pill had I not read the side effects. I will refuse to endure 2-3 months of this.

I was put on this a year ago, and it worked great, then 7 months ago, I would and would not get my period. I talked to my doctor about the problem she said it was normal. I recently started getting my period twice a month.",anonomous15

Before birth control pills I would have horrible periods. Heavy bleeding, painful cramps, period would last for months, vomiting, etc. On this I had only a 4 day period! Light bleeding and the cramps were better but still hurt. I would definitely recommend this for women to try.",kitkat278

131,Junel,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10.0,,"October 7, 2008",20,Ovcon 35 (ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone):I was given Ovcon 4 years ago because of abnormal irregular bleeding.  I decided to try this before a hysterectomy.  I had no other problems and was near menopause age. I did not want to have surgery when everything was healthy.  It worked great for me with little or no side effects.  I am now 52 and got through this because of Ovcon without the surgery.,DECOY

It is nice, but my doctor didn't mention it when she prescribed it.  Was a little stressful the first month when you skip your period and no one has an explanation.  Turns out it is a side effect.",Anonymous
