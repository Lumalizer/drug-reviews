I have a few small uterine polyps that need to be removed. I wanted to take something to control the bleeding until I get my surgery. My doctor recommended this mini pill because it does not contain estrogen. This pill had the opposite effect on me, my bleeding got worse, passing large blood clots. I have severe cramps and need to take Advil constantly to control the pain, also this pill has given me very bad bloating. I read that it contains lactose and I’m lactose intolerant, and my doctor did not tell me that this pill contains lactose.I have taken birth control pills in the past and never had any reaction.I don’t recommend this specific Jencyla.I only took it for 2 weeks and I’m going to stop taking it as I’m becoming anemic due to the severe bleeding I started to have while on the pill.",Anonymous

However over the last 18 months I’ve experienced extremely irregular cycles (starting my period anywhere from day 21-31) and terrible cramps. I also spot for 1-2 weeks before/after my period. I’m 41 years old, I’m in great health and very active. My gyno prescribed Norethindrone to help regulate my period. I’ve been taking it for 6 weeks now, and despite taking it at the same time everyday, it’s surprisingly made all those things worse! I’ve had three periods during the last six weeks and the associated cramps are more painful and last much longer. It seems to be doing the opposite of what my doc hoped it would do. Some of these reviews (as well as my doc) say it can take 3-6 months to see improvement. I’m going to try and stick it out, but it’s very frustrating that this BC has worsened all the things I was hoping to improve. Will update in another month or so.",SeekAdventure

The Doctor said to give it a couple months to see if it helps. Back track a few months and I had been having severe anxiety that was being someone managed with mixed depression. From the first day I started taking norethindrone I felt normal. I thought maybe it was a coincidence, but everyday since I feel good. I have more energy and I just feel good. I haven't had any anxiety attacks and feel balanced. I've had one menstrual cycle since I started the pill and my cramps were more manageable, the bleeding was more evenly expelled throughout the week, and much less clotting.

It lasted 3 weeks and thats when I decided to see a gyn, after doing some bleed tests and ultrasound, she suspected I was in perimenopause phase with estrogen dominace so prescribed this pill to take for 2 weeks to regulate my periods. Bleeding stopped after 2 days, I continued taking this pill for 10 days fearing side effects and increased breast cancer risks associated with any HRT. After 10 days, I decided to give a break and see how it goes. 2 days later, I started having some brown discharge perhaps old blood from previous period, I was hoping after this brown withdrawal bleeding, I might be fine, but I started bleeding heavily, this time bright red blood with some uterine lining and clots.

Anywho I started taking this medicine because of extra long periods not heavy just long and I'm only 28 in 2 days. I've been tested for many things but only thing diagnosable was PCOS because of cysts on my ovaries. So I started the mini pill and it pretty much stopped the bleeding to just a couple spots when I wiped, so that was great but unfortunately it caused my blood pressure to sky rocket and if I didn't already have insulin resistance I do now. I went to the bathroom to pee so much today so needless to say I don't want to be diabetic so I will stop this meds and try to get to the root of why I'm bleeding and not mask it with pills because the headache alone isn't worth it. Plus it says it increases your risk of cardiovascular episodes and cancer... so I'm good I was diagnosed with pots at 16 and struggle so Im good",Norethindrone

Bleeding came back heavier and longer with huge clots. Got cramps like crazy, which I had never had before. After six weeks total on the medication, three weeks of which was spent waiting for an appointment at my OBGYN, it was awful. Bleeding through Ultra tampons and super fatigued by the final week. Turns out I'm VERY anemic and need to monitor myself for lightheadedness and I might need to get a blood transfusion. Now on hormones to stop bleeding and iron supplements to get me out of the anemia before we even try any other birth control. My advice.

In January, they switched me to this as I had no other option for my condition. They told me I needed to shed my lining. After 3 months, I realized my migraines were worse than ever, & still are & I’m on month 11. From January to the end of July, I was spotting every single day to the point I had to wear a pantyliner everyday, even with my bikinis because it wasn’t enough blood for a tampon. In August, I completely stopped bleeding. I have not had a period since. I get cramps everyday & have taken numerous pregnancy tests. Of course everyone is different but the mini pill should be a last resort or nothing at all. Not to mention my hormones are completely out of whack because of this.",Dakota

Next day my bleeding had stopped completely and I was finally pain free!! Day 4 I ended up in the ER because I became super dizzy while driving and my BP shot up to 200/110, I literally felt like it was the end of me. I became diagnosed with a DVT and my dr is sending me for a brain scan because after that episode I have been experiencing major brain fog, confusion, delayed thinking and just really feel slow and dizzy.

I didn't gain much weight, my discharge was normal, I still had a normal and predictable period each month. It did impact my mood negatively, though. After that first year, however, it really screwed me up. I rapidly gained 15 pounds due to increased appetite. I began to experience two, one-week-long periods each month with extremely heavy bleeding and intense cramps. My period schedule turned into bleed for a week, ""off"" for a week, bleed for a week, then go 3 weeks without bleeding, repeat. My period and it's symptoms have become way less predictable.

I started bleeding non stop in January 2021 and boy was it heavy.  I was soaking up pads every thirty minutes.  I saw an ob/gyn he recommended surgery.  I chickened out because Covid was high and I was afraid to be in the hospital.  No priority April 2021 and then on May 3rd started up again.  It is July 2021 and still bleeding.  So my doctor gave me these until we figure out the next steps.  I also have one fibroid.  She did some blood work so I'm waiting to see what my hormones are.  I felt all alone so am thankful for this forum.  It's nice to not suffer in silence.  I think I'm going to so an ablation my mom had it done in her 50s and it stopped her from bleeding.

The pain, clots and nonstop bleeding of this last week have just convinced me to let Mother Nature take the wheel - I'm so exhausted and over this. Praying for menopause.

The first period on a new pill pack was 13 days of a PROFUSE bleeding every single day of it. Then I started having 10 days periods with 2 weeks in between. All periods were so heavy, I'd soak a jumbo/overnight pad in 2 hours. I would have a huge tissue clumps with it, plus bad cramps and back aches. The worst of it were nights. I had to wear two pairs of underwear with 2 jumbo pads, or I would bleed on my bed. I contacted my doc when my first period marked day 10, asking for advice. I was told it was normal when switching pills and I have to deal with it. After 2 following packs it became clear that this is not normal to me. In addition to all the trouble, I have to use the brand that provides most absorbent pads in the biggest size. Which causes me a great deal of skin irritation. And I can not use tampons.

I've started taking two pills instead 3 daily as told by nurse practitioner after I've complain about constant bleeding. The bleeding stopped for two days but because of pressure and pain in chest and like my pressure was so elevated I did start taking two pills daily but then bleeding came back even worst. I've been constantly bleeding for 3 months on and off now and I'm already anemic and had complete my iron infusion 3 weeks ago.

I had tried other birth control options but had complications. I was reluctant to start the pill because I had heard so many horror stories. I have been on the mini pill for over 1 year now, and I can honestly say that this is the only thing that has made me feel normal. With PCOS, it can be difficult, especially your emotions. I don’t feel as crazy anymore. When my period would roll around before birth control, I would be so emotional: anger, anxiety, depression. Now, my periods are a breeze. I don’t have them as often but when I do they are light and symptoms are much more manageable. I would also recommend using this medicine for at least 3-6 months for the effects to really set in.

36,Norethindrone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 30, 2021",5,"Errin (norethindrone):Prescribed because fibroids and polyps (and probably pre-menopause) made period flow unbearable. CONS: -If I don't take the pill at exactly the same time every day, have 4 days of medium flow between cycles. Happened 3 times. Can't even be 20 min late or early. Felt like 3 periods in one month (every other week).-Cramps much worse than before. Still happen between cycles too. Often need Tylenol mid-sleep. -Clots huge unless I preemptively take Advil every few hours.-Breasts sensitive to point of aching sometimes.-Period can be a week earlier or later than the previous one, so planning is impossiblePROS:-Actual period flow is slightly more manageable than before.-Spotting between cycles much less (sometimes not at all) unless I screw up my dose time.

I changed the time of day I took the pill from PM to AM. Two days after doing that I had a horrible experience--my uterus released almost 1/4 or 1/3 of a cup of what looked like liver.  ENORMOUS blood clots that filled the entire pad with a bloody, pulpy mess, I thought I'd had a miscarriage. I kept releasing these clots plus heavy flow the rest of the day. I stopped taking the pill at that point and since then I've had 3 straight days of flooding--soaked through my pad, underwear and bled all over my pants in 4 hours.

I asked the dr for this pill because I read it had less of an occurrence of blood clots and I have antiphospholipid syndrome which puts me at a slightly higher risk of clotting.

I had one normal period, and then I had a period EVERY OTHER WEEK for two months. The severity of my periods had not changed at all, so I was essentially bedridden every other week with bad cramps and heavy bleeding. I was too exhausted to do anything on the 'off' weeks.I hoped this birth control would work for me because I can't take estrogen birth control in case it would raise my intracranial pressure. In fact I do think that taking Camila still raised my pressure anyways, but not a significant amount. It also may have been exacerbating the ovarian cysts and polyp that I have, which are probably causing my painful periods in the first place! Ultimately the risk of side effects on top of the excessive bleeding was not worth it and I stopped taking this medication.",Didnt Work

A couple of months ago, my heart started to flutter real bad, and it was concluded it was due to insomnia. My blood pressure also went up, and would NOT GO DOWN. I had to start taking Lisinopril, with Amlodipine. Then, my skin started to get dark on my cheeks, hyperpigmentation. I spoke with my doctor today, and I expressed I would like to get off the meds and give my body a break, and she agreed. I’m starting to cramp a lot, as well.

I’m not saying it’s good for everyone, as everyone’s bodies are different. It has worked wonders for me. I will post another review as time goes on. I also haven’t had any issues with my hair falling out or being dull. It’s so nice to not be so damn hormonal everyday. I feel so much better health wise now. I think it’s honestly balancing out my chemicals, but I’m not a doctor. ",Kris

Before starting Errin I had suffered with heavy, heavy periods for the past five years.  So heavy in fact that they forced my body to expel the Mirena my doctor had put in place.  The clotting and pain was horrific.  We had tried everything, it seemed and Errin was our last ditch effort before considering surgery.  Thankfully, Errin has worked for me.  I knew it would take some time for my body to get used to the hormone and balance out so when my first period was horrible, I hung in there.  In June I did not have a period at all.  I had some pink when wiping but that was it.  Everyone is different and I'm grateful this worked for me.  It has changed my life.  I'm 50 and only have a few years to go before menopause but I would like to transition ""quietly"" instead of looking like a blood accident.  Good luck to everyone.",Socalprinses

Sometimes I would go 3 months with no period...sometimes I would have 26 day cycles. Sometimes I would go a month or two feeling great. Sometimes I would have PMS symptoms (mostly bloating, tender breasts, and some cramping) for months.  Knowing this BC is not as effective for preventing pregnancy, several times I felt like I might be pregnant and I stressed about it a lot.
