0,Jolessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,4,,"March 19, 2021",6,"Pluses: clear skin, no mood swings or headaches. BUT, at 1st I spotted everyday for months. Light enough for a pantyliner. My period stopped for a while, went fine. Then, with no warning, I would have GIGANTIC clots & blood gushing when I stood up. Then later on in the day & the next day...nothing. Happened a few times. Last straw: family goes to Disneyworld for the 1st time. 2nd day I’m walking around the park then stand up, start gushing blood. I spend the whole time afraid to stand because I’m going thru a tampon & pad every hour. Next day nothing. 4th day at Disney, same heavy gushing & clotting. Airport gushing. Arrive home, bleeding lightens. Then I stand up, heaviest bleeding EVER! Soaked thru a super tampon, pad, my underwear, pants were soaked with blood & it stained my bed. I am 39 YO & this didn’t happen before Jolessa. I had heavy periods but not random hemorrhaging in between cycles. I have stopped this BC & my provider is trying me on something different!",Unhappy mom
1,Jolessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 6, 2020",1,"I've been on the bc pill since 13 years old for severe periods. I'm now 43. My previous obgyn put me on Jolessa two months after I gave birth last year. My previous prescription of Kelnor worked wonderfully, and I told her that. Still, she insisted on giving me this garbage. I've had the worst experience with this pill. It hasn't helped at all. I've had my most recent period for a month and a half now with terrible pain and an incredible amount of huge blood clots. A month after starting Jolessa, I started having random horrible cramps without bleeding. I would occasionally have spotting with or without pain. I ditched that obgyn and am about to start a different prescription thanks to my pcp who I trust completely.",Cleo
2,Jolessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 3, 2020",17,"I am shocked at how many bad reviews this BC has!! I was on this pill for around 5 years, and recently got off due to getting migraines with aura, and now am switching to an IUD because it has no estrogen. However my time on this pill was great. everyone’s body is different but when I got put on this I had little to no spotting- it was so nice only getting a period 4x a year as someone who suffers from heavy bleeding/ cramps. For people who are worried / experiencing spotting, give your body a chance to get used to it! You aren't bleeding for 3 months straight so it’s normal to get a little bit of spotting as you are approaching the placebo week. The only cons I would give this BC is the fact that I did get migraines on it, it definitely made me a little more emotional (but any BC will) and I did notice a little thinning of my hair. However I never got pregnant, boobs grew a size, didn’t gain any weight, and it improved my period significantly. Don’t believe hype on this site!",bncj4477
3,Jolessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 4, 2019",0,"My daughter has PCOS among other problems, she started this drug when she was 12 and now at 23 is having breakthrough bleeding. I can only assume that her body has changed that this drug no longer is helping keep her periods at bay.",Red
4,Jolessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,,"November 2, 2019",5,"I started taking Jolessa to alleviate peri menopausal symptoms, ie inability to sleep, weight gain, fatigue, unpredictable periods, thinning hair and new facial hair. The the first month on it, my facial hair lightened up and my face became smooth again. My mood lifted and I felt great, but that was the only beneficial thing about it. I started bleeding for months - heavily. Using tampons and pads at the same time did not protect me from accidents. The minute I stood up in the morning it would be flowing all over the place. I started getting bouts of sciatic nerve pain, severe pain in my knees. I'd be unable to go from sitting to standing position. I had headaches and more weight gain. I immediately stopped taking it and opted to try natural herbs and vitamins. hemp oil, kohosh, omegas and magnesium/zinc. Plus I just started taking the cherry juice concentrate. I wouldn't recommend it. Try to go natural, you'll see the benefits like I did.",Princess Poppy
5,Jolessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 20, 2019",2,I bled for months after taking this pill! I’m stopping it right now !,Hihi
6,Jolessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 23, 2019",1,"Ok so I was on my period for 30 something days and I went to the doctor and all the wanted to do was put me on birth control which I did not want for many reasons !! So basically they didn’t do anything ! 20 something days later I’m still on my period ! Day 54 I wake up and get out of bed and blood just starts running through my clothes all over the floor !  My husband rushed me to the E.R . I had 2 obygn exams there but there was too much blood to know , an ultrasound but nothing was found. All they could really tell me was I was sick with anemia from loss of so much blood and they put me on jolessa for 5 days.  The first day I took 5 and lesser each day. So never found out what truly happen or why my cycle was 54 days and what happen that morning !! Very scary situation and even more scary that trained doctors couldn’t even figure it out.  Overall the jolessa made me feel awful !! Didn’t have a cycle for 6 months.",Savethesharks
7,Jolessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 20, 2019",12,"I always had heavy unpredictable periods and hated it. After spending two months straight bleeding an extremely heavy, clotting flow I asked my doctor about alternatives and she recommended taking birth control pills without the weekly break. I started on a different medication but switched to this one because insurance covers it at no cost to me. I haven't had a period in over 10 years and I've never been happier.",Gin
8,Jolessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 11, 2018",5,"Switched from tri sprintec because of side effects started jolessa.  The first 7 weeks were great no side effects no issues. I'm now ten weeks in. I started spotting at the end of week 7 which was normal but it kept getting heavier.   I've been bleeding heavily for 14 days now,  longer than any of my periods before birth control.  I've also had cramps so bad that it caused vomiting  which has never happened before. I'm nearly doubled over in pain half the day and constantly nauseous. I saw one doctor they told me to stick with the pill so I did but my symptoms only continued to get worse so I got a second opinion from a doctor trained in this field.  She recommended stopping the pill. So I did  the bleeding is the same after being pill free for three days  I've been really sick nausea,  and headache.  Starting jolessa was great and I thought it was helping but if I knew it would have been such a nightmare I never would have went on this pill",Alice
9,Jolessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,1,,"July 10, 2016",4,"Started taking this pill 3 months ago. Worked fine the first month. No spotting or anything, now I'm on month 3 and I have been on a heavy flow peorid for 3 weeks. Acne is acting out. And massive weight gain. Used to weigh 120 and now I weigh 134. Do not recommend this drug",Brookeghh
10,Jolessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,2,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 12, 2015",3,"Since being put on jolessa by my gyno about a year ago I have experienced mood swings, increased appetite, excessive weight gain, and most of all, extreme fatigue. No matter how much sleep or rest I get I am ALWAYS tired. I actually only feel well rested and energized when I'm on my period (which makes no sense!) Needless to say I won't be using this birth control much longer. The only good thing that has came out of my experience with jolessa is lighter periods. My horrible cramping is still the same though. Heavy periods and horrible cramping is the reason my gyno put me on this birth control! VERY disappointed.",TJ96
11,Jolessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 23, 2015",1,Going on 2 months now. I had 16 days of extremely heavy bleeding with heavy clotting. I have PCOS and would have some crazy abnormal period but never with severe cramping and clotting. I went through a regular tampon in 1 hour and about 45 overnight pads in that 16 days.  My left breast is considerably more tender at all times and I have random spotting and cramps almost every day. I'll be calling my doc to tell her I'm going off of this pill. I won't make it to the third month. I'd rather use condoms (and I hate condoms).,Stepb
12,Jolessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,3,,"February 12, 2014",6,"I started Jolessa in October 2013 right when my period started at the beginning of the month. Right away I was sick to my stomach several days & My periods normally last the full 7 days, but on this pill it never stopped. It went to a light period and gradually throughout the 3 months got heavier until I started the white pills-the period week, at the end of December. Once I started the new pack January 1st. The bleeding finally stopped until Febuary 1st, started the second month of pills and right away started bleeding again. It is now Febuary 12 & I went to the doctor yesterday she put me on a different birth control Low-Ogestrel 28 and we're hoping this stops my bleeding and works better for me.",hammys.wifey
13,Jolessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,7,,"June 13, 2013",1,"Before being on Jolessa, I had trouble with heavy menstrual cycles that were making me anemic. It took about two months on the pill before I stopped spotting. Now I hardly have a period even on the active pills. The only negative side effect of this medicine is that I've gained about twenty pounds.",Angie3
14,Jolessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9,,"May 26, 2010",15,Jolessa is awesome! I've been on it before and had the spotting during the first pack but then it worked great!  I began using it again and this time my doctor suggested to take the first month and stop for a week to get a period and then continue with the 2nd and third month. (So 2 periods on first pack) to minimize if not eliminate break through bleeding or spotting. Worked well and I couldn't be happier. Regulated and way less painful!,satisfiedwoman
