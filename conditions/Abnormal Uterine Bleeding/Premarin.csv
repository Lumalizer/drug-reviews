I had terrible pain in the left side of my calf, the whole left side of my body was numb, chest pain, rapid heart beat & pal palpations, shortness of breath, dizziness, unbalanced, nausea, I felt like I was dying!",PremarinNightmare
3,Premarin,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,9.0,,"February 9, 2015",10,"I've been taking this for the past 15 years and haven't had any problems. I have an annual check up and so far, there hasn't been any concerns. I did have a urinalysis done for a quarterly blood pressure check up and there was a detection of blood in my urine. Not sure if it's as a result of taking the Premarin but, I made an appointment to go back to the doctor to follow up in 3 months.",notflashinghot
