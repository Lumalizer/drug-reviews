0,Fluticasone nasal,Nasal Polyps,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 13, 2021",0,"I've had allergies to hay fever in Michigan, moved to California and still have sinus problems.  My GP prescribed Flonase about 2 years ago and I recently within the last 2 months have been using it faithfully and regularly.  I would have this  catarrh"" or a constant need to clear my throat, feeling that there is something blocked and  stuffy nose that I can't clear, and sometimes pressure headaches.  Eventually, after a couple days of 'hacking, coughing, snorting' I would cough out this small ""mass"" .  Have to go through this every few days.  But the Flonase or Fluticasone really helps with breathing and pushing these Nasal Polyps out.  So I use my Fluticasone every day, sure does make my life and sleeping much better",GretaS
1,Fluticasone nasal,Nasal Polyps,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 23, 2021",0,"Xhance (fluticasone):Obscenely expensive drug with potentially terrible persistent side effects; was prescribed this after polyps returned again after surgery and budesonide regiment. It seemed to work at first; was able to breathe again after a few weeks. A little over a month later however, I woke up with bad muscle soreness and fatigue, even ran a light fever. Eight months after stopping the drug, I'm still experiencing DAILY dizziness, insomnia, muscle loss/weakness, fatigue, and hand tremors. I can no longer live my life the way I used to. This stuff royally messed me up and I've had to spend thousands of dollars on tests to try and figure out what kind of damage it did to my body (I still don't know).",Anonymous
2,Fluticasone nasal,Nasal Polyps,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 18, 2021",0,"With insurance my Xhance prescription would cost $70/month. Or I can go to Costco and buy a five-bottle pack of Fluticasone for less than $20. Same medication. You do the math. The supposed advantage of Xhance is in the delivery system. Is that fancy piece of plastic worth an extra $66 each month (and more if your insurance doesn’t get the cost down), and is that new device 18 times as effective as the spray bottle from Costco? I have taken Fluticasone for years to good effect, but it now appears someone has found yet another way to re-package and jack up the price on what is essentially a low-priced generic medicine.",SC Traveler
3,Fluticasone nasal,Nasal Polyps,10.0,,"July 3, 2021",1,"I developed nasal polyps years ago and couldn't breath through my nose, smell or taste anything for over a year. Believe me life was pretty grim. I had my polyps removed and apart from being recommended a daily nasal saline wash no other preventative medication was suggested to help prevent the polyps returning. After a couple of years they came back after being diagnosed by my GP. After using useless sprays I was given a product called Flixonase, which is made by Glaxo Wellcome and contains Fluticasone propionate. Each box contains 28 nasules, I shake up the contents, break the sealing cap, lie down on the bed with my head hanging over and share the contents of the drops between my nostrils. The results for me were amazing, I could smell, taste and breath like never before. I now take one capsule per day and I've had no further problems. I'm not saying they get rid of the polyps but they will or should definitely shrink them enabling you to get on with your life.",Martin K
4,Fluticasone nasal,Nasal Polyps,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 8, 2021",2,"Xhance (fluticasone):While the Xhance flucanazole delivery system is indeed a plus, certain insurance plans ( medicare in particular) do not cover the cost. The average retail price for this Rx. is $475.00. While the company offers assistance to those who ""can't afford the Rx.,""the reality is the average income to qualify is below the poverty line.In summary, if you're prescribed this medication,(and it is a brilliant delivery design), just make sure you can afford the cost.",Scott
5,Fluticasone nasal,Nasal Polyps,,,"March 26, 2021",28,"Xhance (fluticasone):I am 22 years old with AERD. I have severe asthma and allergies. I had surgery to remove my nasal polyps and reconstruct my sinuses when I was 18 and within a month and a half my nasal polyps came back. It has been 7 years since I lost my sense of smell and I have chronic congestion. My doctor put me on course of prednisone for the past 2 weeks and I have been on Xhance for the last week, and when I say that I have not gone more than a few days without using Afrin, I have not used Afrin once in the past two weeks! I stopped sneezing, I stopped waking up in the middle of the night because I couldn't breathe and I even have less asthma attacks, but most importantly I am starting to faintly smell things!! I am grateful for this medication. I will post an update when I have been on it longer.",Anonymous

8,Fluticasone nasal,Nasal Polyps,,,"January 17, 2021",1,"Beware of nose sprays that contain polysorbates!  If you are allergic to polysorbate ,as I am, it is quite probable you will develop nasal polyps, if you haven’t already,  this will compound your condition.  Polysorbate is in nearly all prescription drugs, ice creams, salad dressings, dill pickles (Bicks), tooth pastes, ointments etc. Read the label or google!",Anonymous
9,Fluticasone nasal,Nasal Polyps,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 4, 2020",5,Xhance (fluticasone):My ENT put me on this about 3 months ago for Extreme sinusitis terrible allergic rhinitis and I haven’t sneezed 10 times or taken a Claritin in months!!!! This is a complete game changer... best thing ever! I am so thankful for this Xhance Spray. I read a few of the reviews and saw where someone said that their glass vial broke and where concerned about glass being sprayed up their nose. My vial was dropped last night and sad to say it did shatter but I know not to use this now and just ordered a new vial. I like the glass vial as it makes it easy to see how much product is left...although maybe they could look at a clear plastic dispenser in the future!,Wendy

Pressed to actuate and the canister broken cutting my fingers.  Oh well I thought, but then was curious if I inhaled the glass/plastic.   Curious for response.

11,Fluticasone nasal,Nasal Polyps,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 6, 2020",3,"Long time sufferer of sinusitis and then what I call uncontrollable drippy nose. Self medicated for a while to no avail. Eventually ended up at GP who referred me to ENT for endoscopy etc. Polyps!!! They were the cause of all the problems, not hay fever, not rhinitis, not colds - just polyps!! Treatment.. nasal douches.. and Avamys (fluticasone) nasal spray on a daily basis for extended time.Did it work? Drippy nose vanished fairly quickly sinus problems definitely reduced but not gone and the indication is that the polyps are shrinking. I no longer douche my nose but have to remain on Avamys. I would recommend it.. if it works for me who knows who else it may help.  Surgery not an option for me.. at 74 years young I am happy to go with the relief attained so far.",Dmac

I’ve been using it for a few months and I’ve been having terrible side effects.

14,Fluticasone nasal,Nasal Polyps,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 19, 2020",8,"Xhance (fluticasone):My 3rd week on Xhance and there is no change at all. I have never missed one day. Besides the fact that I don't think is doing anything,  it takes few minutes to place this on the right spot so then I can blow air. I have watched videos on how to spray the medication and yet can not  do it right. Why?  Because you have to bend the piece the goes into your mouth in order to blow air up your nose.. I have poked my nose every time and it hurts like anything when I use it. Come on for 3 weeks?!! I would have figured out how to used it. It' s a pain in the butt.",jasmine
15,Fluticasone nasal,Nasal Polyps,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 8, 2020",17,"Xhance (fluticasone):I have been on XHANCE for approx 2 weeks. I have nasal polyps and allergic fungal sinusitis. I have had 3 sinus surgeries. Frequent sinus infections. Always congested. I believed I would live with this condition forever. My ENT doctor at MUSC suggested I take this XHANCE nasal spray. I was reluctant for I had taken Flonase in the past and it had been unsuccessful. I am in disbelief how well this nasal spray has helped me. Although it has only been 2 weeks, I have seen a 98% improvement. No more sinus congestion or pressure.  No more thick, green mucus coming from my sinuses. The spray doesn't sting or smell. I don't have a sore throat due to the medicine draining in my throat. I am able to sleep on both sides without issues. Life is so much better with XHANCE. If you have issues, have your physician prescribe this nasal spray. I also take Zyrtec and Singulair daily. I believe I would need this for the rest of my life. But at least it works!!!!",Harris

17,Fluticasone nasal,Nasal Polyps,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 13, 2020",5,"Decided to try Flonase after my left nostril got completely blocked by an inflamed polyp that was growing right behind the narrow opening of my left nostril ( I’ve had deviated septum since 14 or 15 years old). This blockage led to the worst sinus infection I ever had, yellow mucus that can’t drain, constant headaches, complete lost of smell and hardly any taste left. This has been going on for 3 months now but last weekend it became impossible so I decided to try Flonase as I knew that nasal steroids is the first thing doctors prescribe. It’s day 3 today and the polyp shrunk in size already allowing me to irrigate the left nostril. I might be experiencing side effects like dizziness and back pain/ headache but nothing can compare to the completely blocked sinuses full of disgusting yellow mucus. I hope it will get better soon since now I can flush it 2-3 times a day now. Flonase definitely helped with polyps. A lot.",A

22,Fluticasone nasal,Nasal Polyps,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 14, 2019",29,Xhance (fluticasone):CVS substituted $900 Xhance for the $30 generic fluticasone my doctor prescribed for my allergies. They must be in collusion with the manufacturer.  This product does nothing more than the generic of fluticasone except include a $870 piece of plastic that breaks and looks like a sex toy.,fluticasone

I had sinus surgery in December 2017 to correct a deviated septum, nasal polyps, and congestion. I've been taking Xhance for about a month now, and I've had no breathing issues except minor congestion, which is a side effect of the medicine. I don't have the seasonal allergies I normally would have this time of year. The part that you blow into became blocked (I couldn't blow into it.) after a few days of use, so I just use it like you would Flonase instead. I've gotten a nose bleed, which is also a side effect.",HarmonyDelong

I started taking Loratadine 10mg which helped some with congestion but it just wasn't enough. I ended up getting nasal polyps that made my nose bleed, obstructed my smell and sense of taste, caused difficulty in draining of my sinuses, and made it hard to breath in through my nose, so I started using Flonase. I am only on day 6 and the feeling of my skull bursting slowly went away, I can breathe easier and smell again, it already started to shrink the polyps and the nose bleeding stopped, feeling much better.",CandiCollins

I've also had 2 surgeries with no relief. My quality of life has been VERY poor. My ENT just put me on Veramyst and after 2 days I noticed a big relief. I don't feel like a colony of giant polyps are invading every orafice in my head. I haven't had a migraine, earache or retro-orbital headache in over a week. I haven't regained my sense of smell, however, I'm still discovering the pro's and con's of Veramyst. My neck, back and other body pain is worse but I don't know if that's because the focus has been taken off my face and head.

After the surgery I started taking Avamys (=Veramyst for Europe) for 6 months to prevent nasal polyp growing. First of all I have to say that I felt great relief. My nose never hurt, and I had no congestion or any other sinus problems. However after taking the spray for 3 consecutive months I felt that my nose got dry and I noticed some blood in my nasal secretion. In addition my eyes felt more sensitive and I felt more tired than usual but I have no clue if the last two effects were Avamys side effects.Avamys gave me relief in allergic rhinitis as well even though it didn't completely stop the symptoms.",cloudscraper
