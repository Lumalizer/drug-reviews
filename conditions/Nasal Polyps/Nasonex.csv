1,Nasonex,Nasal Polyps,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 5, 2021",18,"I was prescribed by my doctor Nasonex for my polyps. I used it on and off for couple of years but only yesterday did it dawn on me that all these while, whenever I felt sickly with a very dry throat, difficulties in breathing, wheezing, trembling hands, dizziness, pressure behind my eyes, headache, muscle pains, neck pain, blurred vision, lost of balance, ear pains, difficulties in swallowing and chest pains was all from after using Nasonex! I thought what was wrong with me. Even went to an emergency room thinking I was getting a stroke or a heart attack. Then I realised last night that all these symptoms only occur whenever I use Nasonex but whenever I stopped using it, all of these symptoms would subside. So, I Googled for reviews and saw so many people have experienced these bad side effects. I wish I knew sooner!",Cc

7,Nasonex,Nasal Polyps,3.0,,"August 20, 2012",28,"Like other users I had severe headaches on this, and then the metal taste mentioned.",Anonymous
8,Nasonex,Nasal Polyps,4.0,,"December 3, 2011",37,I have had polyps removed 6 times now and have been using Nasonex since it first came on the market. Maybe it stopped some growing but for the past 5 months I have suffered headaches every day.  Maybe I've used Nasonex for too many years for this to start happening. Since stopping the Nasonex my headaches have ceased.  What a relief.,Anonymous
9,Nasonex,Nasal Polyps,8.0,,"January 3, 2011",31,"About two years ago, I stayed home sick with what I thought was the flu. After about a week of misery and no relief I went to the doctor. He told me that all the awful, flu-like symptoms were actually my hay fever acting up and because I had waited too long to come in I now had nasal polyps. Many members of my extended family has had them and treated them with Nasonex or even surgery (my aunt can't taste or smell now). Since then, I've used Nasonex nearly every night. There's a very obvious difference between nights I take it and nights that I forget - I tend to wake up with throat congestion and a runny nose. Only once have I actually had a full-on nosebleed.",Anonymous
