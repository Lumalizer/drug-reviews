0,Estradiol,Atrophic Urethritis,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 15, 2019",14,"Femring (estradiol):Completely took care of my urinary burning and frequency. Used it for 2 years. Insurance changed, and I paid $385/ring for a year anyway. Just switched to estring, ($95) since I retired, which is rigid, causes pain, and doesn't work. Comparing Femring to Estring and which is best, I will go back to Femring.",GG
