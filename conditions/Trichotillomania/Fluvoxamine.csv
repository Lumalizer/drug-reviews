0,Fluvoxamine,Trichotillomania,3,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 24, 2018",10,"I started fluvoxamine eight years ago to help in managing trichotillomania. Fluvoxamine actually didn't help with trichotillomania at all as far as I can tell, but I actually stuck with it because of the huge difference it made on my moods. Mirtazapine, on the other hand, was very effective for me in treating trichotillomania as well as my anxiety and depression, but it made me super irritable, so I went back to fluvoxamine, deciding I'd rather feel happy than have eyelashes.",HeatherVS
