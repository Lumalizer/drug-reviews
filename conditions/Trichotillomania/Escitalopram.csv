0,Escitalopram,Trichotillomania,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 5, 2021",0,"This medication works great for my depression but it doesn’t work the best for my anxiety, interestingly I know a lot of people who take it for anxiety only. I have pulled my lashes and eyebrows since I was about 11/12 which was triggered by trauma and there became the start of this annoying coping mechanism. I am 22 now and it has only gotten worse since then. I don’t think I have OCD but I like to say that my Trichotillomania is a compulsive disorder triggered from my anxiety or stress. I have been taking this drug for almost 6 months and last night I had a really bad episode that hasn’t happened in a long time. I recommend this drug for anxiety or depression but not for trich, although I think it doesn’t hurt to try cause everyone is different. I think I’m going to continue taking it but will take another medication with it to try combat these urges.",Anonymous

3,Escitalopram,Trichotillomania,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 24, 2013",11,"This my third day on escitalopram for trichotillomania and anxiety. The first two days were rough, I had horrible mood swings, nausea, and loss of appetite. But today(the third day) I felt like a normal person after so long and I'm glad I'm starting to see somewhat of a result so soon. Although I still had loss of appetite and trouble sleeping I'm starting to feel better and I love it.",Kizmi
