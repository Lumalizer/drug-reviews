0,Naltrexone,Trichotillomania,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 23, 2017",5,"So I am still a big believer  that low dose naltrexone does a great job with people. I have no doubt that it works for some people with trichotillomania. However, it did not do that for me. I was pretty disappointed. I have been diagnosed with very minor trichotillomania. But I always have to get my haircut short so that I donâ€™t touch it. I read a lot of reviews being excited about naltrexone. It just did not seem to help. However I still encourage people to try it depending on the severity of their trichotillomania.",VinD23
1,Naltrexone,Trichotillomania,9,,"August 1, 2017",33,"I have pulled my eyelashes and eyebrows since I was 12 years old-am now in my 50s. I recently tried the drug, Contrave (naltrexone and wellbutrin combo) , for weight loss and found that it got rid of my desire to pull. I take the recommended 4 pills/day but don't know how much naltrexone is in each pill. I still have the urge to pull as my usual response to anxiety but the ruminations about pulling, what to pull, where to pull have been greatly reduced. When I do pull, the feeling is very different and now feels like what one would expect when ripping out eyelashes (ouch!). I would say that the ""feel"" of pulling is different-the drug interrupts the pleasure of pulling and I don't feel compelled to pull more. very interesting drug.",trich info
2,Naltrexone,Trichotillomania,7,,"July 4, 2015",38,I been on this medication successfully for over 15 years in regards to trichotillomania. I have to say I do have my ups and downs and am not 100% pull free. But this medication has allowed me to have more control and actual hair long enough to live with my tiny occasional outbursts,gecko1265
