0,Fluoxetine,Trichotillomania,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 8, 2018",10,"It takes a while to get used to the drug, it will make your OCD spike a few times, I also have severe anxiety and it may raise it a bit. Overall pretty good for trichotillomania, I have a head full of hair since January 2017",Jujustu
1,Fluoxetine,Trichotillomania,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 29, 2014",31,I've had trichotillomania ever since I remember. As soon as my hair was able to reach my mouth I started to bite off my hair until high school & I transitioned to pulling out my hair. My hair became so thin & I had bald spots & constantly got made fun of for my thin hair. Sophomore year I began to see a psychiatrist for this & he prescribed me fluoxetine & lamotrigine. I have never told anyone my condition except my family & psychiatrist. I started off my dosage very low & worked them up to the highest mg possible. I am now a freshman in college & my hair is almost as thick as it was before I started pulling. I am no longer made fun of for my hair. I still pull but a lot less than I ever did. The medicines also helped with my depression.,Caseybentley95
