2,Sertraline,Trichotillomania,10.0,,"October 22, 2010",31,"Zoloft (sertraline):Years ago I was taking Zoloft for depression.  I was not taking it for Trichotillomania, though I had been pulling my hair out of a long time.  It wasn't until I stopped taking Zoloft and started back pulling my hair out that I even realized I had stopped!  It was the only medicine that ever helped and I wasn't even expecting it too.  Unfortunately I can't take it long-term because it causes me to have facial tics which over time become very painful.  But most people don't have that problem.",Anonymous
