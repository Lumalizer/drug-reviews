0,Spironolactone,Primary Hyperaldosteronism Diagnosis,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 31, 2016",11,It worked so well on my blood pressure but I have been on my period every since I began the drug.  My doctor refuses to take me off of it because my BP was 190/110 before even though I was maxed out on Diovan and potassium pills.  Now with this drug my BP is 120/80.  I can't take this constant bleeding.  It's not spotting. It full on heavy bleeding now for 6 months.  My Gyno tried to help by inserting an IUD but that only lessened the bleeding a bit. I don't know what to do.,Steph (45 year old female)
