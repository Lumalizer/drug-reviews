6,Hydrocortisone topical,Dermatitis,8,,"February 17, 2009",8,My doctor prescribed this for me because I have diabetes and am also having chemotheraphy for stage 4 liver cancer.  I keep getting sores on my body that won't heal on their own. He thought this might work and it has been a miracle worker on my skin.  It's helping with the healing and the time it takes to heal.  I think it's a great product and ever so thankful that my doctor was sensitive enough to give me this so that I won't be embarrassed by my sores.,QueenHaugh
