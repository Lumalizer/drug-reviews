0,Betamethasone,Dermatitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 30, 2019",3,"After a nasty case of dermatitis that I believe began after a cuticle nick at the nail salon , I found myself in the urgent care after weeks of using fungi nail cure, neosporin ... you name it and nothing worked . Physician I saw prescribed this and it’s the first relief I’ve felt in nearly four weeks of itchy , red inflamed skin. Very happy with the performance of this cream",Starlight
1,Betamethasone,Dermatitis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 29, 2019",7,"I have a severe skin allergy/reaction to mosquito bites. I will literally scratch the skin until I’m bleeding-and then scratch some more! One small mosquito bite can cause half of my leg to itch and swell. Many summers I would have to wear pants and forgo skirts or shorts because my ankles and calves were often scratched raw and/or bleeding. I’m so glad I found this cream-it worked wonders for my skin issues. The moment it was applied, my skin calmed down immediately and the itch stopped. This is the first time in years my legs have actually cleared up entirely, which only took a few weeks. The pain/itching was the most unbearable and I can report that it provided immediate relief. I highly recommend this one for any skin allergy-I am also allergic to my dogs-this keeps any of those break outs in check as well.",Rebecca

3,Betamethasone,Dermatitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 31, 2018",7,"I went to my doctor year after year and he would just say apply moisturizing cream, don’t wash your hands too much. I asked what did I have? He never diagnosed me with anything but yet I had this itchy thick tough skin that had a white color to it. I asked for a referral to a dermatologist and when I went to see him I was told that it wasn’t anything!  Frustrated I tried over the counter antifungal cream, tea tree oil, cocunut oil and nothing helped.  I went to my daughter’s medicine cabinet and used her betamethasone dipropriante cream and  after two days I noticed an improvement so I keep using it for 2 weeks twice a day and wow! My skin was getting back to normal. After years of suffering I was able have my skin and cuticles became normal again within weeks! The best product and the only product that worked for me.",Ana B

5,Betamethasone,Dermatitis,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 28, 2017",10,"I live with very sensitive skin and have trouble with deodorants. I had started to try different ones and I had developed a dermatitis and psoriasis like rash in my under arms. This ointment worked well, but after five months I was still having trouble. I was using this cream religiously and in the last month and a half or so, I developed these scattered long marks that resembled stretch marks. I didn’t question it because I have always been on the heavier side. Next thing I know, I developed a bumpy rash on these  stretch marks . I could see my insides, they would bleed, and my skin was peeling off thread- like. So, I’ve been between two doctors and I visited today. Come to find out, using this cream long term or at all thins the skin.",Anonymous
6,Betamethasone,Dermatitis,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 9, 2016",13,"Betamethasone Lotion 0.1% for itchy scalp.  I used this for over 40 years for scalp control.  Then a couple years ago, the price shot up - over 10X the normal price which is rediculous.  So my doctor turned me on to a stronger type called Clobetasol Propionate .05% topical.  This works even better than my older stuff and my insurance covers this.",BRAD_V
7,Betamethasone,Dermatitis,10.0,,"June 16, 2015",13,"I had severe blisters on my hands and wrists.  The blisters were in various stages, some forming under the skin, some filled fluid, some ruptured.  I had 50  blisters on my left hand & wrist and about half that number on my right hand & wrist.  The pain, burning, piercing pain was extreme.  My doctor prescribed several different creams that did not work and then this Betamethasone Lotion.  I finally had relief.  This worked within minutes to relieve the pain and within 2 days to see amazing clearing of the blisters.  I am so grateful for this medication.",Ba-bi
8,Betamethasone,Dermatitis,10.0,,"November 20, 2014",29,"I've had severe eczema since I was 13. I'm now 30. My Dr has put me on so many different meds for it that I began to lose hope.  It would swell up and get really itchy.  I have eczema behind, on, and inside both of my ears.  It's also embarrassing because people would ask if I knew I was bleeding out the ear all the time.  After yrs of no relief I switched Dr's.  The new Dr put me on betamethasone and after using it for only 2 weeks it cleared up to the point that it was almost gone! I thought nothing would help it and that I was stuck with it for the rest of my life with no relief.  I'm glad I was wrong!  Every couple of years I will get flare ups,  and all I have to do is put the betamethasone on it and it's gone the next day. Definitely recommend this.",LilAngel17225
