0,Ultravate,Dermatitis,9,,"July 7, 2008",8,i have this condition on my hands (palms) and feet (heels). I use halobetasol one day then use Dovonex then next. Halobetasol 3 days and Dovonex 4 days of the week.  Using these are the only things ever prescribed that has given my any relief!! It does not go away but slows the blisters and cracking.,Anonymous
