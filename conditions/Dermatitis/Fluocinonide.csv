0,Fluocinonide,Dermatitis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 26, 2020",3,"For the last 2 years I have suffered with extreme itching in my crotch area. Embarrassed, I put off going to see a dermatologist for a year and a half. I'm a 59 year old male with some weight on me. Finally I could not take it anymore.  I went to a dermatologist in October 2019. I was told it was a yeast infection.  Medications given to me did not work. I went back in January 2020 and was given a different treatment.  Again it did not work. I went back in June and was given this medication.  The first application I put on before bed. The next day, my symptoms were gone. No itching and burning. I had eczema when I was younger that would come and go. I guess dermatitis is similiar.  Finally relief after 2 years of suffering. This stuff is great",Relieved
1,Fluocinonide,Dermatitis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 14, 2017",15,"I developed some sort of skin rash that absolutely burned my hands and was inflamed. My family doctor had prescribed a weaker ointment that I had been using that had not seemed to help it much. I went to my dermatologist who told me to start using only dove soap and cerave or cetaphil lotion on my hands each time I washed them and then use this on my hands twice a day for two weeks. She also wanted me to make a follow up appointment in two weeks and told me to stop using my Bath & Body Works (that part has been hard). I started seeing results the next day, not a whole bunch, but some and it didn't burn as much. By about 3 days of using it, the difference was really noticable, and now, a week later, looks normal",Gamecockgirl97
2,Fluocinonide,Dermatitis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 13, 2017",11,"I had  Chemo induced itching/inflamation .I struggled with the side effects of perjeta (pertuzumab) to the point were I was considering stopping treatment.   My arms were completely scabbed from scratching in my sleep and I was not finding relief from other options.  Within a week of using fluocinonide, the constant itching stopped and within three months all my scabs were healing. I still have scars, but the constant itching is gone.",Jfk423

5,Fluocinonide,Dermatitis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 26, 2014",12,Given for Poison Ivy rash and does  seem to deaden the itchiness exceptionally well. I received relief within about 15 minutes.  It almost numbed the overwhelming itch which I had on my nose.  Fantastic results and highly recommend.  My skin is very sensitive to most items but this cream doesn't bother me at the .05 strength.  ,Female57
6,Fluocinonide,Dermatitis,10,,"October 8, 2011",19,"I have had a periodic skin rash on my legs that comes and goes, usually in the winter months but can appear any time. This cream clears this condition up in a matter of days. I recommend it.",Anonymous
7,Fluocinonide,Dermatitis,2,,"June 26, 2011",20,"I have contact dermatitis on my elbows and armpits and the cause is still unknown but the doctors gave me fluocinonide ointment to put on it and all it did was take the redness away, it didnt stop the itching or take away the raised bumps.",Anonymous
8,Fluocinonide,Dermatitis,10,,"February 28, 2010",24,"Works very well for contact dermatitis etc., better than any store bought cortisone. One rash I had for years was cleared in 1 use. Now I use on occasion at first signs of re-occurrence. I had some conditions that it did not help.  If it does not clear in a week or so, get the doctor to do some kind of test to find out whats really wrong (most likely virus or fungus). 45 year white male.  No obvious side effects.",Anonymous
9,Fluocinonide,Dermatitis,9,,"January 2, 2009",52,"Lidex (fluocinonide):My dermatologist provided me with several sample tubes of Lidex to treat a mysterious rash, which he thought was a fungal infection, that recurred in the same spot on my skin several times.It worked like a charm, and since then, I have used it sparingly whenever I get a stubborn jock itch that won't go away with anything else.My doctor warned me it can thin the skin, so I use it as little as possible but the good news is a single thin application is usually sufficient to knock out whatever is troubling my skin and soothes the itching in such a way that it doesn't come back again for months and months. I think it's a very, very good medication for stubborn itching, when other remedies aren't helping.",RRRSSSKKK
10,Fluocinonide,Dermatitis,10,,"July 2, 2008",74,Lidex (fluocinonide):At the start of every summer for 5 years my son gets the worst mystery rash on his back (Contact Dermatitis) they call it. We just can't figure out what that contact is. It has itched so badly in the past that he had actually scratched himself bloody and had to be sedated at the ER.  Finally his doctor prescribed Lidex 0.05% and almost instant relief. It's been amazing. No side affects to date for him. I don't know who created it but Thank you.,riccas77
