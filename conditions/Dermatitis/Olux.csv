0,Olux,Dermatitis,8,,"July 13, 2010",10,"I've always had dermatitis on my scalp and face, but the rashes on my body started out as allergic dermatitis after it reacted to an antibiotic called Vancomycin. But then even after all my antibiotics, the rashes kept getting worse and worse. I got a biopsy done, and the results were that I had psoriasis form of dermatitis, which is similar to psoriasis. At first the dermatologist prescribed Clobex, but it only worked on my arms. I still use the Clobex shampoo for my scalp. After that, the dermatologist told me to try Olux. I've been using Olux for a couple of weeks now, and my body is clearing up, especially my back and thighs.",Anonymous
1,Olux,Dermatitis,10,,"March 30, 2008",12,"Olux is a mousse that is massaged into the psoriasis on the scalp.  After using this 2x per day for approximately 3 wks I no longer am using T-Gel 3x a week.  I'm back to using my old shampoo.  No itching or flaking of the scalp.  It's so easy to use, too.",Anonymous
