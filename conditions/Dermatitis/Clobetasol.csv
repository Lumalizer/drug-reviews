1,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 19, 2019",16,"I had been experiencing an intense vulva itch for 4 years. I tried everything under the sun, with no relief! My skin had become inflamed, swollen and broken. I had become so depressed over this condition as I couldn’t find relief. I was miserable! Finally, I was given this lotion, and upon 1-2 applications, my condition improved to nearly 100%. It’s been a month since I was introduced to it... and I have not scratched once! Miracle drug, no doubt!",Anonymous

3,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,3.0,,"February 27, 2018",7,"Got this prescribed for eczematous dermatitis and after an hour of application I started feeling very dizzy, drunk-like dizziness, room was spinning. I felt like that the whole night. In the morning I applied again and felt a little better but still lightheaded. Felt heartbeat increase and took my blood pressure and it was pretty high and I'm a 31 year old healthy slim woman. I started looking for side effects and found that  the drug can cause new or worsening blood pressure, also dizziness and fainting. Stopped using it after 3 days and feel a lot better. For those 3 days, my skin did not improve a lot.",Loolie

6,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,10.0,,"February 9, 2017",11,"Temovate (clobetasol):I have used both Temovate and the generic Clobetasol for the treatment of poison ivy. Both were equally effective. Over the counter meds-ointments such as caladryl and cortisone did nothing to relieve the itching and misery, however, as soon as applying temovate or clobetasol to the affected areas, the itching was relieved  and greatly reduced almost immediately. Within a day, the blisters were dried up and within 2 days everything cleared up. This is experience with these topical steroids over the past 30 years. Nothing else has ever worked, and I tried everything including over the counter ointments, lotions and Aveeno baths.",MikeEdmi
7,Clobetasol,Dermatitis,10.0,,"January 27, 2017",9,"summer of 2016, i got burnt to a crisp. decided not to wear sunscreen. Dumb idea. after the burning, and peeling of my skin came the ""hell's itch"". i wanted to RIP MY SKIN OFF. people USE SUNSCREEN.  if you decide not to wear sunscreen, be prepared. if you want a quick solution when the itch arrives, CALL A DERMATOLOGIST OFFICE. make sure they accept your insurance, and BEG to be seen. I was prescribed clobetasol propionate solution, told to use Sarna Anti itch lotion in between clobetasol usage, also take an over the counter pill of zyrtec once a day, and was also prescribed hydroxyzine to help me sleep. And to wear COTTON clothes all the time.  took all that medicine due to the complexion of my skin. BEST DECISION EVER.",Anonymous
