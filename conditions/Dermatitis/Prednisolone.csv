4,Prednisolone,Dermatitis,,,"September 29, 2009",16,"To me prednisolone is a wonderful drug. It helps me to solve several of my illnesses.First, it strangely resolves my finger dermatitis problem on my hands. Before my skin got cracked and bloody, I would feel my fingers have rashes that were swollen, painful and itchy at the same time. I took prednisolone tablets regularly for about six months, starting with 3 X 5mg daily down to 3mg daily. Then after that just take 3 to 4 mg as and when needed now. It has stopped 99% of the problem.",William Tan
