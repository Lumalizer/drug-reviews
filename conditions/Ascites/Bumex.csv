0,Bumex,Ascites,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 2, 2020",14,"I have non-alcoholic Ascites and Cirrhosis due to Liver Cancer.  I gained more than 100 pounds due to fluid retention.  I tried 80mg of Lasix two times a day, but had significant side effects (dizziness and ear pressure).  I also could not sleep through the night due to nocturia.  My doctor switched me to 2mg of Bumex twice a day and I lost 90 pounds in 10 weeks.",Eddie Jo
