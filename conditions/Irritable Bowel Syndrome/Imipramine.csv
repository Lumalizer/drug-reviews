0,Imipramine,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 26, 2021",3,"I started taking the 10MG of imipramine in September 2020 for my IBSD.  I was told to take it at night because it makes you drowsy.  I had the total opposite reaction. It kept me up at night and did not make me drowsy at all.  I ended up switching to take it in the morning instead. By November I noticed that the low dosage was not helping much with my IBSD.  My doctor upped my dose to 25MG and I started having HORRIBLE night sweats.  I was waking up EVERY HOUR at night drenched in sweats.  Other than that, this medication really worked for my stomach when the dose was at 25MG.  I wish I did not have this horrible side effect!",Kate
1,Imipramine,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10,,"September 14, 2020",24,"After 30 years of IBS and having taken many prescribed medications including nortriptylene, dicetal, pristique, all of which are supposed to be helpful with IBS, nothing worked for me.  I also took herbal supplements and Metamucil and tried different diets, including the FODMAP diet.  I tried high fibre, low fibre, no fibre and everything in between.   I tried eliminating dairy and wheat from my diet.  Nothing worked very well at all.  I also tried Align and other probiotics etc.   Finally I have found something that works for me after 30 years.  And it is the prescription antidepressant medication called Imipramine.   At a very low dosage of 25 mg at bedtime along with one heaping teaspoon of Metamucil in the afternoon, after 30 years of suffering with severe IBS, my symptoms are gone.  Be aware that it took about 10 days before I was symptom free.   This post isnâ€™t about me.  I am posting this in the hope that it can help someone else who is suffering.  Rick H",Rick
2,Imipramine,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1,,"February 12, 2019",12,"I was placed on Imipramine, 10 mg. Taken at bedtime. 3rd week after starting it, I began having nerve-like pain & burning down both legs into my feet, lower back pain & muscle spasms in back and legs. I couldn't sleep & was irritable.3 days later I started noticing balance & coordination difficulties. It was so bad I was finding it hard to stand & walk, often falling into walls.  I was dizzy & shaky. My cognitive abilities were diminished. Days later, close to the end of week 3 of being on the Imipramine, I began to have nerve-like pain in my arms & hands, my lips & tongue were numb & lips peeling excessively. I was sure it was the imipramine by then, and stopped taking it at week 4. 30 hours after my last dose, I noticed a slight improvement of side effects. 4-5 days later all the side effects were greatly reduced & by 7 days after the last dose of the Imipramine, all symptoms had stopped & I began to feel like my normal. I never noticed that it helped the IBS.",Ohio Buckeye
