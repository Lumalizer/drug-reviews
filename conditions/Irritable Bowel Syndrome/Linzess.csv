2,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10.0,,"February 9, 2022",0,I have been unable to go to the restroom normally for over a month. I was prescribed linzess by my doctor. The first time I took this med it was around 10 minutes it sounded like Godzilla was screaming in my stomach. Then it hits and you are in a full prairie dog panic. Then is the immediate relief of all the pressure being gone in literally 2 seconds. It was over a months worth of paperwork in 10 sittings in a span of about 4 hours. I was scared to leave the house all day. It was like being epsom salt pranked in a drink. The 2nd time was the same so I take it on my Fridays to have a day to recover. This stuff works and make sure to be courteous and flush ALOT.,Steve
3,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 30, 2022",0,"My experience taking Linzess is nothing what I expected. I IBS-C so my dr prescribed Linzess. I asked if it was anything like a laxative because I don't like taking laxatives. He insisted it wasn’t so I decided to give this a try. First 2 days I wanted to die. I haven’t left the toilet in hours. I felt like I took a laxative but without the cramps. This medication is good to use if you 100% can’t go but I really don’t know how someone can take this everyday. Especially if you have work, school or if you ever have to leave the house. I have a part time job at a hospital and I’m a full time college student I really don’t have the time to be exploding in the toilet every 5 minutes. I was expecting to have regular bowel movements not constant diarrhea. I’m disappointed but if you take it as needed I guess it’s a quick fix.",Carter
4,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 19, 2022",0,"Haven’t got a specific diagnosis (IBS-C vs chronic constipation), but was given samples to try because the chronic constipation was causing an anal fissure to not heal. About 2 weeks into therapy it finally kicked in, and I was having a bout of diarrhea in the morning. This was seriously inconvenient; how do you manage if you have to be somewhere? Maybe take it WAY earlier? I also noticed that the initial bit of stool was quite hard every morning, which was painful as always, followed by diarrhea. But I have sleep problems, so forcing myself awake extra early isn’t fun. I stopped taking it before the samples ran out. However, I’m going to give it another try. My doc suggested I drink less (only when thirsty) but I’m not sure how I feel about that as I tend to get easily dehydrated and live in bone-dry Colorado. One huge positive I noticed though was that my gas/bloating went away. After the diarrhea I had almost no gas for the rest of the day. So that was really fantastic.",JillyJam
5,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 21, 2021",0,"It worked for the first ten days, after that it worked only off and on. Usually diarrhea immediately after taking it, then followed by constipation. Now it doesn't work at all, just makes me more uncomfortable after I have taken it.",Ian
6,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,7.0,,"December 8, 2021",1,"I haven’t seen any others talk about this side effect, but the nausea I get from linzess is severe.

7,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 3, 2021",0,"My doctor gave me this to prep for a scope. I asked if diarrhea was a side effect and if it was it would be unbearable severe. Within a couple of taking this med I didn't stop going for over 2 hours. I got up, sat down for 5 minutes and ran to the bathroom. The next 4 hours were spent this way and it still hasn't ended.",JPM
8,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 26, 2021",0,"I have IBS-C and Linzess worked pretty well for me. The times I do take it, I’m making sure that I’m near a toilet for the next couple hours because oh my god this makes you poop, a lot. It works really well if you regulate it and know when to use it for yourself. It’s different for everyone and I only take it whenever I feel really backed up now. I’d say be careful when first using it though. I’m at the lowest dosage now, but when I first tried it at the medium dose, I became pretty dehydrated and had to stop using it for a while. Talk to your doctor about how best to use it for yourself.",Mcpoopsalittle
9,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 24, 2021",0,"I've had chronic IBS  for over 10 years w/last five years serious issues with switching randomly the IBS type D vs C.  That makes getting a bowel regiment complicated/ difficult.  I have tried almost everything and nothing has worked.  Miralax, supplemental fiber and laxatives are actually not a good long term solution because it can worsen the constipation long term. My doctor prescribed this medication I started out on the low dose it was a miracle however the price of this miracle came at a cost.  The cost being that you cannot trust so fart you will be in the toilet for a few episodes of going to the bathroom until it has subsided. Sensation is pretty specific your stomach will rumble w/feelings of impending bowels. Be near a toilet do not use prior to going to the airport/ car ride I actually had to go up in dose and I use it at 11pm for 7am BMs timed right for the right bowel patient it is excellent. Those of you having issues may required lower dose or your problem may not suit linzess.",RN+patient
10,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 7, 2021",0,"I was prescribed this medicine by my GI doctor before undergoing a major open abdominal surgery for MALS (Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome). Part of me wishes I would've began taking this medicine sooner, but I was worried about the ""side effects"" everyone keeps talking about. I firmly believe now if I had taken Linzess sooner, then I could've avoided having a Post-Op Ileus which the hospital was responsible on the day of my discharge. I began taking Linzess after consulting with my GI about 1 month after my discharge & one the day I took the medicine, I had been constipated for 4 days. My GI doctor has me on 72 mcg/daily & starting from the first day I took the medicine it has been very beneficial to me. I do not feel the need to increase the medication (even as directed) because I typically have at least 1 bowel a day (92% effective for me). I do also agree that things like high caffeine, any alcohol or high stress (like intense exercise) reduces the efficacy of the medication.",malssurvivor080
11,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,,,"September 18, 2021",0,"This drug has been a lifesaver for me. I suffer from severe IBS-C, to the point of having to do multiple colonoscopy preps to get relief after 9 days without any bm. Once my body got used to Linzess (after about 1-2 weeks of the side effects many describe), I’m basically just normal. Sometimes I’ll have an urgent be if I am not careful to follow the 30 min before food recommendation, but otherwise it’s been just amazing how much this makes has improved my quality of life.",Relievedmom

14,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 9, 2021",7,Linzess works. It does have a major flaw. It can affect the stomach for hours. It also may upset your stomach and have you running periodically  to the bathroom. I'm taking it twice a week to curb unwelcome side effects. My advice is to plan when not to take it in order to enjoy your day.,Titan
15,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,2.0,,"April 26, 2021",22,It does cause loose stool. I find the same day it’s loose the next day I take it I’m constipated. I have to push real hard to have a bowel movement. It feels like the loose stool is able to pass the collection of harder stool leaving behind more formed stool. I ended up in the hospital impacted. The stool had a strange odor.,Jo

17,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,6.0,,"February 21, 2021",108,"I just cannot! Because of my IBS , I bounce between symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. Yes Linzess works, but oh wow! I don't know how anyone takes this drug frequently. There has been nothing but straight liquid explosions. You definitely cannot underestimate urges to pass gas as it is likely just more watery stool (found out the hard way). I sat on the toilet so long that my lower extremities went numb but I couldn't get up to stretch because every time I would try more stool would come rushing like a flood. There were light stomach cramps and some bloating but nothing too severe. I will keep this medication on hand and use it merely as a laxative if I again experience a string of days with no bowel movement.

20,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2021",21,"I have been dealing with severe constipation from IBS-C which is exacerbated by a medication I have to take for over a decade.  I have tried literally every lifestyle, diet, supplements, and OTC laxative you can think of.  Linzess has been absolutely life changing for me.  I take it 30 mins before breakfast.  Most days I have a completely normal BM within 2 hours of eating.  If I don’t I always have one that day, just after lunch or dinner instead.  I have not experienced any diarrhea.  I have experienced mild bloating and occasionally cramping but it pales in comparison to the symptoms associated with my severe constipation.  Honestly, I have cried multiple times from sheer relief and joy to find something that worked.  I should have listened to my GI doctor and tried it sooner.

Later diagnosed with IBS, diverticulosis, and partial anal stenosis. My preferred regimen after a few years of using it, is early morning every other day. I make sure I have a 4 hour window of non-interrupted bathroom access. The 1st bowel movement begins at an 1 hour and 15 to 20 minutes after taking the medication. Then several more times for 3 and a half to 4 hours. Yes, it gives me diarrhea but that’s nothing compared to the years of pain and discomfort.",JR
23,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 30, 2020",6,I’ve been using Linzess 145 MG For about a year and it definitely works but planning your day is a nightmare. What I’m trying to say to you is you don’t know from the time you take the pill when you’re going to have a bowel movement. It could be from one hour to four hours after taking the pill. Then there’s another problem you don’t have a consistent formed stool. It could be anywhere from diarrhea to normal and every day is different. Also you’re using bathroom anywhere from one hour to two hours or more. So how could you plan anything in your life in the morning. So any appointments have to be after 1 PM. Such as doctors or meeting up with friends etc. the only thing I could say is it definitely works and you’re not in pain from the bloating and the constipation but it’s a horrible life.,Bob

The first 2 weeks the linzess caused me eat to constantly, but I still had to take suppositories or enema to have a bowel motion. I am now in the 3rd week with linzess, and I have experienced a full belly of air morning, noon, and night. I have to force myself to eat, because I have so much trapped air, and it’s very difficult to even belch and pass gas. I think I will discontinue on my own today. I can’t wait until my doctors appointment, because the bloating makes it difficult for me to breathe, because my stomach is expanded to the max day and night. This week I had to eat less and drink Vernors and take gas x in order to get a slight belch. Vernors and gas x usually works well for me. When I belch now it’s more so like the air reverses and go into my stomach, and causes me to spit up my food. :(",Hyper

37,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 20, 2019",65,"Linzess had huge impact on my quality of life. You have to be careful to follow the dosing restrictions. Food within a certain period of dosing especially fatty food will elicit an expedited response from the medicine. This means that the symptoms you may feel which normally might be strung out over a period come fast and hard. I began eating oatmeal for breakfast every day. One high fiber package and one normal. I also keep miralax on hand to fine tune my GI system. Altogether, this medicine used correctly can make a vast difference.

Keep hydrated as you will lose quite a bit of water.",Johnnylakis

I resumed the Align, which has been a blessing, and now do Linzess every second or third day.  The Linzess is a very effective laxative, although it will give you at least one or two bouts of diarrhea every time.  But without the Align it seems to aggravate the abdominal pain and bloating, NOT alleviate it.  Align is more effective for gut pain.",Ron4Sure
195,Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 22, 2013",63,"After reading reviews, I was skeptical on taking Linzess when my doctor prescribed it. However, I am now so grateful that I am on this medication! I have not had any side effects and it is working perfectly for me. I take it at the same time every morning, drink lots of water, have breakfast,  and within a half hour or so, I have a bowel movement. Some days one, some days another shortly after, then I feel great the rest of the day. I used to have terrible stomach aches and headaches before Linzess, it seems to have all gone away now for the most part. Obviously depends on the severity of your problem, but Linzess is a miracle pill for me!",KV_09

I've been suffering from IBS-C for almost 9 years now and it's the worst kind of hopelessness when you keep getting told ""try this"" and it doesn't work or it makes it worse. It took Lizness and about 2 hours later I had a small meal and within 30 minutes I was having watery stools, but NO PAIN! It's true that about 2 hours after it causes diahrrea but OMG I'll take painless water stool over that agonizing, gut-wrenching pain of my IBS attacks. I was having them daily and had lost hope.

Drs., Hospitals,ultra sounds, copious quantities of ANY laxative, stool softeners, etc. once my upper intestines are backed up under my rib cage NOTHING works and I start packing on the lbs. then I tried Linzess. It adds moisture to the upper intestine which when I took it monday I was 175, I went to the bathroom about 6 ish times after about 5 hrs. by tuesday I was down to 165 completely cleaned out! I also took full responsibility not to eat ANYTHING that would irritate my tummy. I took linzess the next 3 days but nothing happened. I believe it is for the upper intestine area and because mine is 100% better I dont need it. Thank goodness I now have a weapon against IBS",ECK1969

If only I had this few years ago before I gave up hope.  Praying it will save small intestine that's left.  As a Plus, it takes the 8  pain from irritable bowel syndrome flare down to a livable life.  Maximum dose.  If I didn't have a Fibromyalgia flare & lesions formed inside I'd be perfect.  Gives me hope & gives hope to many who were losing options.   Did have to Fight Blue Cross to cover but hey realized it was cheaper than many ER visits for pain & constipation.  Makes life easier.

I take it first thing when I get up in the morning and wait to eat until after I get to the office. It seems that as soon as food or drink goes in, yesterday's junk comes out. If you know you are not going to be near a restroom (i.e. going to the beach, park, etc.) then skip the pill that day. I'm sure that's not recommended but it gives you some control over your body at least. Everything goes back to normal when you take the pill again the next day.",CherryLynn18

My GI started me on Amitiza, which worked great for 3 or 4 months, then I started having constipation again, but without the extreme cramps.

I've been on Linzess 290 now for several months, and it still works, but the way it works affects my daily plans.  It may just work too good.  I have very watery movements about 3 times every morning, and because of this I can't leave the house before noon.  I haven't had a solid stool for months.  Good thing I'm a stay at home mom!

I finally gave up and after a few years of having nothing my new doctor gave me Linzess. I was sure it would be like most of the others but it worked right away and has continued to work for 3 months. I love it. Thank you to the pharmaceutical company for this product. My bloating and bad cramps have gone away. I did have to change how I take it, it says to take 30 minutes before I eat but I take it after I have eaten some of my meal because it seems to work better.

But my Dr. referred Linzess to me. The only difference is this works quicker & I can't stress hard enough how important it is to be near a restroom, I give 10 thumbs up to the makers of this medicine it really helps me but unfortunately I have to return to taking my Peridiem, Lizness is too expensive!",alnatural

Even on the lose dose, there were days where I would go 10 times or I would have diarrhea.  My doctor didn't want to take me off it though, because this is the only thing that really has worked.  I have noticed, that the amount of water I drink while taking it/before my meal, can affect it. My doctor also thought adding a probiotic might help settle it down a bit.  I've started taking the probiotic with Lizness and since then, I've had more normal bowel movements.  Some days I do have more than one now, but 2-3 is not bad.  I highly suggest trying the probiotics (colon health) before discontinuing due to having too many bowel movements or diarrhea. ",Anonymous
