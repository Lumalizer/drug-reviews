I was prescribed this medication years ago. I’ve only taken three or four times. And every time I took it, it made  me feel better... took away the horrible pains and bloating and stomach spasms. Also helped release the tight intestinal muscles and relieved constipation ( I was afraid it would exacerbate this from what I read on the internet but it did the opposite).  Hopefully I will stop hesitating and take this before I am in intolerable pain.  Hope it helps anyone reading this.

8,Hyoscyamine,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9.0,,"March 28, 2021",19,"Severe IBS-D most of my life, flare ups have gotten worse as I’ve gotten older to the point where the pain is so bad I black out. Turned blue the last time, fun! So I got prescribed this last month. Light episodes - basically everything passes with a whisper of discomfort. Mid-range - mild cramping but everything is still tolerable & basically a boring bout of diarrhea (totally new to me). Had a severe flare an hour or two ago, immediately took one, sublingual 0.125mg. It helped ease the pain, but didn’t stop it. Got sick, came back & took another since it seemed to be kind of painful still. This current episode has by far been the worst, about the level of intensity a light flare would be normally. A bit painful, but not doubled over just trying just to stay conscious. Side effect of taking two pills this time vs one - green poo. Be sure to stay hydrated, this will dry you out. Overall though it’s changed my life for the better & I’m grateful.",Toodles

I recently started having such severe stomach pain that I could barely move. I would be severely constipated, bloated and unable to pass gas for weeks then I would have extreme diarrhea for a couple days and go right back to being constipated again. I also developed really bad acid reflux. I was put on amitriptyline and omeprazole it didn’t help at all. My GI doctor finally put me on hyoscyamine twice a day and 40mg of omeprazole and it has been an absolute miracle! I have no pain anymore. I’m able to have pretty regular bowel movements, no more acid reflux and I’m not bloated at all. I finally have freedom from the misery.

I was on one drug for 18 years and had three colonoscopies with three different GIs. About four years ago I began vomiting and diarrhea a lot during the summer. One year it was about a very other week. Just this passed year I began experiencing severe constipation too. I thought my UC was getting worse, or that I was not tolerating the heat well. Another symptom was profuse sweating. My new GI looked at my scope results and the recent history and determined that I was misdiagnosed. Instead of UC it should have been IBS. He said the vomiting and sweating was related to the vagus nerve. I quit the UC drug and began hyoscyamine sublingual. So far I have had good results. I am sometimes  not sure if I should take it at the slightest hint of a stomach cramp, but I’m not taking chances. I go for a followup soon to see if the doctor’s new diagnosis is correct.",Erw
