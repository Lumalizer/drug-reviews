I take it for Crohn's disease If I start cramping up and take Bentyl it does typically help with bowel spasms fairly well.  On the flip side of that, it tends to make me a bit drowsy and kind of lethargic and occasionally causes panic attacks and anxiety that last for a few hours.  Kinda have to weigh the risks with rewards though.",Josh

For many many years, I have been suffering from extreme stomach pain that leaves me unable to think, move, speak, or do anything. The pain was increasing in frequency and I was crying and screaming in bed multiple times a week. I didn't think anything would ever help. Now I take it as needed when I feel cramping coming on. It usually stops the pain within 10-20 minutes, especially if I ""catch"" it early. Sometimes, particularly when traveling, I have to take two and it can take more time to work but it almost always does in the end. My stomach pain is often so severe I am sweating and crying in bed wishing I wasn't alive anymore, and that was happening multiple times a week.

I suffer from alternating IBS-C and IBS-D, so it doesn't seem to stop diarrhea or relieve constipation. However, it works pretty good for abdominal cramping. I also have endometriosis that is causing the IBS like symptoms so even though I also have an IBS diagnosis it's not the main issue. That could be part of the reason Bentyl only works on the abdominal cramps for me. Definitely worth a go though as I didn't have any bad side effects.",Anonymous

It's been a lifesaver. The first month I took it religiously as prescribed because the pain was the worst. Now I take it as needed (per my Dr) and it helps so much even with an upset stomach. It does me a little tired but not enough to make me wanna go to sleep for hours. I keep it with me at all times in case my stomach acts up.,Pizzachick83

These reviews helped me to finally be brave enough to take Bentyl for IBS.  I was sick for months.  Constipation, bloating, sudden diarrhea with syncope sometimes, lost 35 lbs. without trying, and highly sensitive to various foods.   I logged everything I ate, drank and every BM for 5 months.  I was tested for everything under the sun...  multiple blood labs good, multiple stool labs good.  Good upper & lower GI's.  CT scan.   I had nothing physically wrong with me to be found.  My primary care recommended I try Bentyl.  I avoided it due to some of the horror stories I initially read online about possible side effects.  Months later I finally tried it after reading some of your reviews on this website.  For the first 2-3 days, I had some minor dizziness and felt tired.  But after sticking with it for a few days, those side effects went away completely and I feel absolutely normal.  I only wish I'd had tried Bentyl sooner.",Johnny B
13,Dicyclomine,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 22, 2021",0,"So I had IBS-C where I wouldn't poop for about a month at a time (Diagnosed at 7 but struggled with it since 5). So I was given this pill (recently within the last year) to help my system not cramp, bloat, and nausea. When I first took it, I noticed no difference. So then I later got the same pill from the hospital and just stuffed it in my closet because it didn't do much for my IBS-C. Fast forward and now I have exclusively IBS-D so I decided to give it a try. I read it worked relatively fast and it was great. 10 minutes  after I took it, I got diarrhea again. I thought that after that the meds would begin to help. Nope. It didn't do anything noticeable. I'm a little out of focus but not any major side effects either. Like these pills don't do anything good nor anything bad. I took 10 MG. I took it last night and in the morning and it didn't do anything to help me. Defective pill?

Even after antibiotics, I was still having severe pain- just slightly different. It felt like someone was squeezing something inside me. I'd get spots of burning pain as well as double-me-over/can't move pain. I was prescribed Bentyl & it has been my savior. If I wake in the middle if night from severe pain, I reach for my Bentyl & within 10-20 minutes the pain is relieved enough to go back to sleep.

No bloating and gas after meals (or in between) and I no longer look like I’m 4 months pregnant all the time.

Today was my fourth day and my pain and constipation are so severe I thought about going to the ER.  I am trying to get my bowels moving again on my own.

At first I was just managing it with over the counter probiotics, enzymes, fiber gummies, etc. but overtime everything stopped working.

I take bentyl as needed anytime I feel the onset of my stomach cramps, but typically I don’t need it more than once a day. As soon as I take it, the cramping subsides and I no longer get to the point of extreme pain. But in my experience, once my stomach cramps get to their worst point, I don’t find relief with bentyl. It only works for me if I catch it in time. I often feel my heart beating faster than usual, along with some drowsiness when I take it. A much better feeling than the cramping though.
