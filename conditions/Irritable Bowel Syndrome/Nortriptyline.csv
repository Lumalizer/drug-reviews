2,Nortriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 10, 2022",0,I was around 35 when I was operated on for Crohns. Then came depression. A doctor seeing I was seriously underweight prescribed Nortriptyline. I took that and sometimes the generic aventyl. For the next 30 yrs I had no Crohns problems. But because of the dry mouth side effects I decided to stop the med. Crohns returned! Six months ago I needed a second surgery. I lost weight till I looked like a skeleton. Then I remembered Aventyl and Nortriptyline. I decided to retake it to gain weight. I took just 2 pills. IMMEDIATELY all gut pain and symptoms got better. I can now eat almost anything. Only seldom do I have slight pain which I expect will disappear when I go back to my higher/recommeded dosage. I wish doctors/reseachers would investigate the IBS and Crohns connection. This could be a breakthrough.,leyland

I started taking 25mg nortriptyline and it had made a huge difference. I never could get any sleep and tossed and turns at night due to the pain. I noticed I started sleeping better and longer and didn't deal with daily pain. However, I had tried to stop this medication in the past and it caused major withdrawals.

7,Nortriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 4, 2021",16,"I was put on one 10mg Nortriptyline to see if it would help with severe bowel pain, it did seem to help a bit in that the pain stopped lasting the whole day, after a few weeks it was increased to 15grams and then to two 10 mg tablets making it 20mg.  Unfortunately it made me very constipated and I had the worst headaches I've ever had in my life including Migraine that I suffered from for a couple of years.I have only been taking this drug for about 8 months and I was really hoping it would help the severe bowel pain that I have daily.I have stopped taking the 20 mg and have gone back trying just one tablet of 10 mg which I really hope will help.Another thing the drug causes is the most horrible taste in my mouth when I wake up in the morning that is there every morning  and is difficult to get rid offI had big hopes for this drug. I do intend to try taking just 1 tablet of 10mg to see if I get any relief taking that dose",Mave
8,Nortriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 12, 2020",29,"Nortriptyline changed my life from the drama of IBS.

So glad my NP prescribed it.",Xj
9,Nortriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10.0,,"June 10, 2020",93,"Honestly, this medication saved my life - it is a miracle. I have suffered with IBS for 10 years (am now 20) and it caused me to miss so much school. I started on 10mg of Amitrityptline in Dec 2019 and within a few weeks I had really terrible mental side effects. I became apathetic & had sustained low moods which were uncharacteristic. I switched to 10mg of Nortriptyline after 3 weeks and have been on the same dose since (it is now June 2020). It took exactly 3 weeks for me to start feeling a difference - but then after that, the improvement just got better and better. I now have almost no IBS issues!This medication won't, however, erase your food intolerances. If I go near dairy or fried chips, or have loads of large meals then I might still have a bit of trouble. But I went from having such a limited diet to now being able to eat almost anything, and it has made life so much easier.

10,Nortriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 16, 2020",16,This drug nortriptyline  made me feel nothing. I didn't care about nothing much. It caused my boyfriend left and I didn't care at the time. Giving this drug for people with IBS its crazy. I would never again take anything like that. Before I realised it ruined my love life.,Nica

Two years ago I became intolerant of wheat and dairy and developed IBS D. I tried Nortriptyline at 10mg which didn't help with the pain or diarrhea. I then moved on to 20mg and have been on it for 2 months with less frequent diarrhea but still with pain. I've just decided to come off it now. The biggest improvement in my IBS symptoms was using probiotic, which I think I will start again.",Flip
12,Nortriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 9, 2019",16,"It worked like a charm for no more than about two years (possibly less) until the side effects started to wear off, but while it was working I could almost have believed myself cured. The drug was given to me for relief of peripheral neuropathy pain, not IBS, but my doctor told me constipation was a common side effect. I assured him that would be no problem. So far I've not had a lot of the aching all the way round and not feeling well in the belly that I had every day, but I'm continually having to clean myself and am therefore permanently sore. I am going to have to seek something else for this. Having been relieved of the misery of it and finding out just how miserable I had been, I'm not willing to suffer with it any more. I'm quite angry that my previous doctor let me continue believing there was nothing that doctors could do for IBS and let me carry on dragging through my household chores feeling like death warmed up.",Anonymous
13,Nortriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 12, 2019",62,"After years of suffering with IBS-(D), I ended up seeing a brand new doctor at the Polyclinic. He started off treatment by eliminating all of the scary stuff- I had an endoscopy, colonoscopy, gastric emptying study, blood work, etc. When all results came back normal, he decided to treat the IBS symptoms with Nortriptyline (25 mg per night) and the low fodmap diet. I am thrilled to say that my symptoms have finally subsided, at least enough to where I can live my life and eat comfortably. Although I wouldn’t say I’m completely symptom free, I feel significantly better. I’m not sure if it was this medicine or the low fodmap diet that worked best, however I will continue to do both and slowly add foods back in. Definitely try this out if it is recommended for you! This is coming from someone who suffered for 6+ years and has tried every diet, supplement, and medication known to man.",Anonymous
14,Nortriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 25, 2019",17,"I'm 23 years old, have had IBS-C since I had my galbladder removed at 18, and have been in extreme pain on a regular basis. A doctor switched me from 10mg dose of Amitryptaline (made me too sleepy) to 10 mg of Nortriptyline saying the side effects would help with my IBS symptoms. Within two weeks I had developed  agoraphobia. I was scared of the door of my apartment, physically terrified, had no idea why. Wasn't able to change medications until I returned to my home country over a year later. It did help immensely with my IBS symptoms, it didn't cure everything, but I could survive daily life. If you have a history with anxiety or depression, even if you have resolved it through psychotherapy as I did, be cautious of any mental changes after starting Nortriptyline. I wouldn't recommend starting it if you live an isolated life and don't have a loved one to monitor your changes in behavior. It took me two months to realize it was the medication and I wasn't just going insane.",no one

I saw several doctors and had an MRI, ultrasound, blood tests you name it I had it. Finally, after doing my own research I asked my doctor to put me on 10mg . After about 3 days I started to notice a difference and after a week about 95% of my pain was gone.  This med worked wonders for me and saved my life! I went from only being able to eat plain chicken, potatoes and spinach to being able to eat anything I want. I have been on this med for about 2 months now. I do not have any side effects to speak of . Everyone is different and your results may vary. Give it a try but try and stay at 10mg if taking for pain.",9lives

My doctor prescribed nortriptyline. I filled the prescription  but did not take it because well I almost thought it was foolish. I was not depressed... But  then I thought  what the heck. I started the 10 mg every night. In 3 days the only side affect was no more running to the bathroom. OMG  for me it is a miracle. I do have vivid dreams but that is ok and Also sleep well and feel great when I wake up.,Mousse
19,Nortriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10.0,,"October 28, 2017",30,I was first put on this med because I suffer with migraines and the doctor wanted to see if it would help with them. Far as my IBS goes I was put on Dicyclomine which wasn't helping me at all. After being on Nortriptyline for my migraines I stared taking noticed that it was helping me with my IBS. I wasn't having the sharp pains anymore and didn't have to worry about staying near a bathroom. Seeing that Nortriptyline wasn't helping me with my migraines the doctor took me off of the meds. I've been off of it for a month and since then my IBS has been in full effect. So my family doctor put me back on them which I will start tonight. Can't wait for it to get back into my system so it will get it back straight,Mizz Greeneyez
20,Nortriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,5.0,,"August 23, 2017",23,"Doctor Prescribed this to me after I was diagnosed with IBS. It seemed to work, but I didn't believe I was getting full effect. The doctor said at my young age of 17 (I'm now 18 since August 2017) I should not take as high as a dosage as some people but my pain I had told them I needed more so I moved from 10mg to 20mg. I often get very thirsty as a side affect and I'm almost always constipated. I'm actually typing this up as I'm in the bathroom right now, constipated. I don't believe I should be taking other medicines like laxatives or probiotics just to make up for this medicine that should be helping me.",IzzyJD
21,Nortriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10.0,,"July 12, 2017",60,"One of the first reviews I've written regarding a treatment. My IBS-D got to a point where I was visiting the bathroom about 5-6 times a day. When I wasn't in the bathroom the uneasiness associated with IBS stopped me from focusing on anything I tried to do. All I wanted to do was stay in bed and distract myself with movies and TV shows. I spent lots of time researching online and trying various treatments including elimination diets, supplements, various exercises etc.. My GP recommended I try Nortriptyline at nights starting at 10mg dosage and said that it'd take around a month to kick in. After about 3 weeks I switched to taking it in the morning and it's been working wonders every since. Pretty much IBS free and have my life back.",freedom12356789

My doctor switched me to 25mg of nortriptyline after complaining of constipation on 10mg amitriptyline. I've had practically no side effects compared to amitriptyline except worsening constipation. Have had to use miralax aggressively to counteract this but it works. No pains at all and has also helped with my anxiety! I'm sure it would work even better if I had IBS-D instead.,Slowpope

I was ALWAYS afraid to go out to eat. I'd always make reasons to get out of going out with friends. It literally ran my life I've felt better since the start and wish I've been given this years ago.

My life revolved around going to the bathroom. I started taking nortryptaline and after a few days the pain subsided. Then, after a few months and increasing to a max dose of 40mg I now have NORMAL bowel movements. This medicine is a miracle. It also prevents my migraines which were occurring up to several times a month. I only experienced side effects of dry mouth, fatigue, and brain fog for the first couple months. I now have no negative effects. Thank you Nortryptaline for giving me a normal life.",LFuh

No more pain, no more bathroom sneak attacks (thank you!!) and no more bloating! For the longest time it looked like I had a belly but it was all bloating! I can see a significant change in the decrease of bloating. The first couple days after taking the medicine at night would result in a little fogginess in the morning and fatigue. Now that my body has gotten used to Nortriptyline, I have much more energy and honestly a whole new outlook on life. I don't even want to think about how I felt every single day before Nortriplyline. I owe my Dr. big time!! :)",Miss Tata

30,Nortriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10.0,,"September 8, 2016",50,I experienced abdominal pain due to IBS for years.  These pains were present no matter what I ate.  While these pains were at their peak I could hear gurgling in my stomach area therefore I knew they were gas related. Doctors tried every test known but couldn't find anything wrong.  I had nearly given up hope.  The only thing that seemed to help at all was activated charcoal.   One day a nurse practitioner prescribed me nortriptyline to trial.  She told me that it wasn't for IBS but it may help with some of its symptoms.  Within a week my pains went away and have been gone now for 2 years.  I take one pill every night before bed.

It did work within a couple of days, however it also came with side effects.  I would wake in the middle of the night and not be able to go back to sleep. The worst side effect was a marked decrease in sexual performance.  I discontinued the medication after two weeks.  Within a few days the IBS was back, but the side effects were gone.",Anonymous
47,Nortriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8.0,,"September 24, 2010",72,"I was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome two years ago in August 2008. It's been a long, lousy 2 years.  I've been on many different medicines and none of them worked.  Finally nortriptyline (25mg) once a day before bed has FINALLY given me relief.  It's only been one week since I started this drug but it's been a week where I can actually leave the house and not worry about my IBS (diarrhea) issues.  I'm a 37 year old male.  Lomotil and Imodium have only worked partially for me.  Nortriptyline worked right away (the next day I was issue free - and I'm not exaggerating)  I wish my doctor had me try this medicine earlier, although I do understand him wanting me to try other medicines first.  HOWEVER, I still take a half Imodium every other day with this medicine.",Texas37
