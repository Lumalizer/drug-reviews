3,Rifaximin,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 4, 2022",1,"This is a nightmare drug. I was given this drug for a course of two weeks after testing positive for SIBO, but I only made it 5 days in because the side effects were so intense. Any food or drink at all would set my stomach off to levels I hadn't ever experienced before, I was perpetually exhausted but I couldn't sleep at all, I developed violent and depressive thoughts. And even after taking it for only  5 days, I'm 3 weeks out from stopping and these symptoms have only just SLIGHTLY improved (with the help of many, many OTC drugs- I'm sure if I stopped taking those it'd be just as bad). My entire body feels ruined. I personally know one other person who suffered similarly but for a shorter time thanks to this drug.  I would heavily advise people not to take it for this particular condition, in hindsight it was not worth the risk.",rio
4,Rifaximin,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 13, 2021",0,"It's a mask for a deeper-rooted issue within your body. I hesitantly took it, and it turned my IBS-D into IBS-C. However, it improved my quality of life a lot. I no longer had to run to the bathroom all of the time. It lasted about 5 months and my symptoms are starting to show again. If you're ok with having to do this med over and over, this is a good fix for you but it won't ever solve the problem. I would see a Naturopath or Holistic Dr instead of taking this and get to the root of your digestion issue. Have them run some tests like for parasites, food intolerances, parasites, etc. Good luck and please know you're not alone!",Zulu

Only diagnoses has been IBS and Anxiety. Have had success with HCL Betaine + S Boullardii + probiotic ( lacto bifdo) until it stopped working.

BUT THEN...about 2 months ago the pain came back the way it had years ago but 10 fold. So I went to a new GI and he had tested me for something I never heard of, SIBO and it came back positive. He immediately prescribed me this medication. This is my second day on it and all I can say is I pray it works.

Yet, from the first thing in the morning, all day, and into the night, I could never be sure when I would have to run to the bathroom. Finally, my doctor prescribed Xifaxan .  Because it was prohibitively expensive, I put off getting it because the cost for 14 day treatment was equivalent to almost the total monthly amount I get from Social Security. Finally, I was able to obtain the medication through the manufacturer’s  patient assistance program. I cannot tell you what a difference this medication has made. I can go about daily activities without worry. The audible stomach rumblings have ceased, and the flatulence is gone. When you read about IBS-D they say the only real side effect is the stress and psychological effects. More true words have never been spoken. I have my life back and I am so grateful.",Nan

The bloating was painful and caused back pain with difficulty sleeping. I normally have a lot of gas and all of a sudden stopped being able to pass any. Eating any food caused increased stomach pain. I also started getting headaches with fatigue. I was willing to put up with the headaches and fatigue but the increased amount of bloating and stomach pain made it too difficult to stay on the medication.
