It's always causing an inconvenience in my life. I finally had a doctor prescribe Xifaxan and she admitted she hardly does, cause it's so expensive the majority of people can't afford it or their insurance won't cover it. After struggling with my insurance company for weeks, it finally got approved. This was the best thing that has ever happened to me, I cried! I felt normal! No more pain! I also felt so terrible for everyone who has the same problems and can't get this medicine....I was very fortunate and its seriously  life changing!

I am also hypoglycemic, so the actual TEST for SIBO had my blood sugar super low...probably 2 days to recover from that! The first 2 days on the drug I have felt dizzy and tired and my arms super tingly (?). But the BM's improved immediately so I didn't want to stop the Xifaxan. Now at 4 days, I'm not sure. Sometimes I start feeling amazing.I am also following a diet for candida and paying close attention to food combining. Just today started feeling the abdominal cramping come back! Really not sure what to do here....",biker rock star
53,Xifaxan,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 12, 2014",52,This was given to me for SIBO (I've suffered from irritable bowel syndrome for years). I took it 3x/day for 14 days. Although I had no side effects from this medicine it did not help with resolving my SIBO. I even did another test for SIBO after I took the antibiotics and there was absolutely no change. Also luckily my insurance covered so it was $70 but without insurance its around $900!,Anonymous
54,Xifaxan,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8.0,,"March 2, 2012",85,"It definitely helped with cramping and diarrhea but I still did have the occasional episode of diarrhea. However, after 5 months I'm back to where I started. I don't know how I feel about having to take an antibiotic every 5 months or if thats even recommended/safe.",Anonymous
55,Xifaxan,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,6.0,,"June 19, 2011",101,"The only thing that gave me relief was this medicine.  After having endoamoeba hystolitica (sp?), 3 years ago, and long after killing the amoeba, I had different symptoms related to intestines.  Chronic loose bowels and bloating.  I read about this medicine and convinced Doctor to get me a prescription for this (it wasn't as yet FDA approved for irritable bowel syndrome). Within 3 days I began to normalize, after 1 week was symptom free for 6 months.  Slowly I am beginning to have problems again.  I started my first dose again today and hope to normalize again.  Wish it didn't seem to return. ",luckysinnimon
56,Xifaxan,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10.0,,"November 17, 2010",118,I have to take the 14 day course every 2-3 months as symptoms do return- but it is worth it! I get 100% relief within 48 hours after I start a course.,Anonymous
57,Xifaxan,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10.0,,"February 9, 2010",163,"I absolutely am amazed by Xifaxan.  After suffering from IBS symptoms for years (you know, wake up with flat stomach, go to bed looking 7 months pregnant, in addition to painful cramps, horrid gas etc...), the Xifaxan eliminated my symptoms in a matter of days. My bad flatulence disappeared. Bloating..gone. Lost a few pounds to boot. Unfortunately, after two rounds in Sept-Oct, my symptoms were back in December. If I could, I would take Xifaxan every day.  Insurance is not cooperative.  After 24 hours on this latest round, my bloating is well diminished and my low back pain is better (maybe because when IBS symptoms aren't bad, I can more easily contract my abdominals).",Anonymous
58,Xifaxan,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10.0,,"May 20, 2009",143,This drug saved my life. I have severe irritable bowel syndrome for 20 years and it completely stopped all my symptoms for 4 months. My doctor recommended that I repeat the treatment every 3-4 months.,Jacob1

60,Xifaxan,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10.0,,"August 17, 2008",126,This medicine saved my life. I have IBS and got some virus or something that attacked my bowels and made me sick for 6 weeks until a new doctor gave me this. Within days I was back on track. From six weeks of weakness and extreme diahrrea it was nice to be normal again.,Anonymous
