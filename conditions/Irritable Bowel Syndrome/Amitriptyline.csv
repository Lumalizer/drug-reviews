2,Amitriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,9.0,,"February 17, 2022",2,"Oh my gosh miracle drug right here!! I have been taking amitriptyline for years now and it has made all the difference. When I first started it took about a little over a month to kick in but it has been great! No longer having to worry about the pain, diarrhea, and discomfort. I take 10mg before bed each night. I did gain about 30lbs within 3 months of starting it #yikes, but it has stayed the same since. And though the weight gain wasn't too fun, the positive side effects outweigh the negative 100%. Dry mouth, fatigue, and dizziness are manageable but pooping ever 10min isn't. So a big shout out to whoever created this drug because it is a miracle!",Me:)

If you are experiencing tenesmus, the urge to constantly ""go"", it might be a case of rectal hypersensitivity. It might be due to hemorrhoids or scar tissue in the rectal area. I suffered with it for almost four years until I figured it out and found out tricyclic antidepressants are effective in treating it. Amitriptyline worked perfect for me. If it lasts, I feel like I might have my life back.",Dwight

After 6 years of trying a host of medications, my MD agreed to try this, and it has helped give me my life back.

5,Amitriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10.0,,"January 18, 2022",2,"A year ago I developed a CDiff infection from over prescribed antibiotics. After they were able to clear it up (30 days drugs and finally a fecal matter transplant) I developed IBS. Everyday was brutal. Pain, diarrhea, bloating and anxiety. I tried all sorts of drugs, buscopan, Clonazepam, hypnotherapy, metamucil and I was becoming depressed.I was at a dermatitis specialist to treat a  6 month skin infection caused by the IBS when she suggested I try 10mg of amitriptyline at night.After the first 2 weeks I overcame the dry mouth and weird dreams side effects. The pain was about 30 percent better. The doctor suggested I bump it to 20mg.After a week I felt great. No more pain, bloating, feelings of fecal urgency or urge of incomplete evacuation.My bowel movements started to normalize and bowel movements went to once a day. I have now started to introduce new foods.My doctors have assured me that 20mg a day can be taken long tern with little risk of dangerous side effects.A",Ed Bowman

I saw many GI doctors who prescribed probiotics or heartburn medications that did nothing.  I found I was able to function by controlling what I ate.  As terrible as it sounds, fruits and vegetables caused symptoms, and I usually did fine with highly processed foods.  However, a year and a half ago things changed and the symptoms got so bad it did not matter what I ate.  I had excruciating pain,  bloating, urgency,  explosive diarrhea, and feeling like I was going to pass out,  and I essentially became housebound.  I saw another GI doctor, had the usual tests and everything was normal.  He prescribed 10mg of amitriptyline.   Being sensitive to meds, I am presently on 5mg.  It started working on day one.  I have had two flare ups in the last four months, but no pain with it.  I am still experimenting with various foods but can eat almost everything. It has changed my life and I will be forever grateful to this GI doctor.",Anonymous

One is Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome, with abdominal migraines - and the other is Irritable Bowel Syndrome Mixed. I asked my doctor to put me on amitriptyline. He started me on 10mg for 10 days, then I increased to 25mg. This medication has saved my life. I was very suicidal and ready to end my life. Between my bowel issues and throwing up for 10 days straight leading to ER admissions... I had no quality of life. I was moving my bowels up to 15 times a day in complete agony. I have been on this medication now for only a month. It has made a drastic improvement in my symptoms. I can move my bowels and completely empty them with little to no discomfort. My stool has also changed back to much more normal consistency. I no longer have my stomach migraines, and I no longer wake up nauseous.

I have watched what I eat and I am a very active 50 year old. Finally, my GI scheduled me for a colonoscopy.  That is when he found severely ulcerated Ileum. It was so bad that they thought I had colon cancer.  I had surgery and removed all infections.  About 2 1/2 month later I started to have cramps and diarrhea again.  It was so bad that I had missed work again.  My GI did another colonoscopy and endoscopy to make sure I did not have Crohn's. I  do not have Crohns. I have IBD with Diverticulitis and regional Colitis. My doctor prescribed 100mg of Amitriptyline. At first, I felt woozy (lack of better terms) and dry mouth. It has been only a week and my pain has subsided.  I felt apprehensive about taking an ""antidepressant"" until I came to this page.

After 17 months of daily pain & worsening diarrhea (which started out of the blue), I stumbled across this page & asked my gastroenterologist to prescribe this med. Within 10 days on 10 mg my pain was gone.  After increasing to 20 mg I started having normal bowel movements most days. I did just have a bad 4 day flare up so I’m increasing to 30 mg. In the last year I’ve had endoscopy, colonoscopy, cat scan, swallowing study, fecal & blood tests, & gene testing. I’ve tried Imodium, Bentyl, Pepto, iron pills, fiber & gas X, acupuncture, probiotics, meditation. Nothing worked. I have never been suicidal but had been wondering (at age 49) if all my good years were behind me & life wasn’t worth living.  I hope my dose increase helps. If so, this is a miracle drug.

I don't think mine is IBS related as all I've had is stomach pain and nausea. Mine started after a bout of food poisoning whereby I constantly felt discomfort and pain and unable to focus. This pain would be constant everyday and was interferring with my life. I had done 3 stool sample tests, 3 blood tests and an endoscopy. There was nothing to be found by any tests. My GP doctor had prescribed me omeprazole assuming I had IBS or some stomach acid problem (which was not the case). Eventually I went to a gastroenterologist whereby I have been prescribed to take a low dose of Amitryptline, I am taking 20mg of this a day. I have been taking it for 3 days now and I have felt a drastic improvement in how I feel, the discomfort and pain has drastically decreased less and I hope that it eventually completely takes care of it.

My mother was also seriously ill, had had to go into full time care, which she didn't like and I felt responsible for.I have had mild to moderate IBS most of my adult life, I had learned which foods to avoid, which pain relievers to eat with and that stress was likely to set off an attack.I took 10mg Omeprazole daily and Buscopan when needed, which was often, going out without it brought on its own stress!My stomach felt so much better, I stopped taking Omeprazole regularly, have hardly had to take any Buscopan.

I'm 26 and my IBS has been awful for 1-1,5 years now. I couldn't work, couldn't go out and still lived with my parents (I was too scared to be alone when I had pain attacks). I started out with 10mg about 3 months ago, this worked but only for 1 month. I'm now on 50mg and not experiencing a lot of pain anymore. I can still feel that my stomach feels uncomfortable but I can live with it. Before starting I was thinking about suicide every day, I even made plans. The pain felt like torture and I felt like life wasn't worth living anymore. I have only started taking 50mg for a couple of days so I'm not sure how it will progress in the next couple of months. I hope it will stay like this! The first week (10mg/25mg) I experienced dry mouth and sleepiness, but it got better after 1 week. with a vengeance",Happy girl

It got worse after COVID started (probably from the stress and lack of good sleep). My gastro recommended 10 mg of amitript. I tried 5 mg for 2 weeks, helped me sleep but no change to bm. I tried 10 mg for 3 weeks, same results as 5mg. I have been taking 20mg and I've noticed a significant difference. Much less diarrhea and overall healthier digestion. I am still having one or two flare ups per week so I will likely increase dosage to 30 mg. The side effects I have experienced are decrease in libido and groggy in the morning (I take it around 7pm). It takes a while for your body to get used to it but I would recommend this for people with severe ibs-d! For me the pros outweigh the cons. I was losing hope but this has given my life a second chance. Not a miracle drug but it seems to be an important piece to my ibs control regimen. Good luck!",So far so good
19,Amitriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 28, 2021",4,"I have had IBS for almost 20 years. Bloating and abdominal pain have been my main symptoms, and they were constant, just to a lesser or greater degree. I have been taking 20mg of amitriptyline each night before bed for about 9 months now and the improvement has been remarkable - I'd say 80% better, some days 100%. Initial side effects were dry mouth and feeling quite ""out of it"" for a few days but they passed. One side effect I think has remained is that I have slight muscle fatigue, most noticeable when I go running. I definitely can't run like I used to. But the benefits of the reduced pain definitely outweigh this - I may try reducing the dose to 10mg to see if I can get a happy medium. Overall, I can't recommend amitriptyline highly enough.",Anonymous

I was apprehensive as to whether they would do anything due to my previous experience in that they didn't really help, how wrong was I. On the first night, I took 10mg along with my other meds. Low and behold I woke up headache free for the first time in 4 days and the IBS pain I'd been experiencing for over a week slowly decreased over the day.I phoned my GP and explained what a turn around I had in just over a week and requested I stayed on them as they seems to work wonders. I went from being constipated for 5-6 days to having a BM everyday with little to no effort. Honestly, if you're struggling with your IBS. Speak with your GP about Amitriptyline",Jen

Doctors say I have ibs-c but also I have some scar tissue from a previous surgery which causes issues in my colon. At first Amytriptyline was great as it reduced nerve pain to almost nothing and I could for the first time in years go out and not be housebound but this honeymoon period quickly faded as I was hit with severe constipation. The medication seemed to bulk form my stools which I could not pass. I bled daily and eventually had a high fever and started to hallucinate and vomit plus my heart would race. Even on laxatives I could not pass. I have now taken myself off of this medication.,Englishman
26,Amitriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 3, 2021",148,"I started Amitriptyline (Endep) for IBS-D that was mainly triggered by anxiety but sometimes food also. After trialing SSRI’s and having no luck, I did some online research and noticed the older anti depressants helped regulate gut mobility. I asked my doctor if I could trial them so I did. At first I noticed the deep sleep but also the lack of that spaced out feeling you get with the newer antidepressants, I actually just felt like myself.  After about 3 months on 20mg, I slowly week by week increased the dose to 50mg and that was my perfect fit, no more anxiety attacks or running to the bathroom due to fight or flight cortisol throwing my gut into spasms. I’m able to go out, have fun and not worry about IBS at all.

I could hardly eat for months. However, all the doctors I saw couldn't find anything particularly wrong with me, save some inflammation in my esophagus. I was at my wit's end after a particularly severe flare-up a few weeks ago, and my GI thought it might be a good idea to try a low-dose antidepressant, since most food intolerances had been ruled out. Within days on 10 mg, the cramps were mostly gone, and now, a few weeks later, the nausea is also gone and my appetite is back (with a vengeance). It's truly a miracle!The only downsides for me have been some mouth dryness and urine retention, both mild, and trouble falling asleep despite the drowsiness, which has been slightly more difficult to deal with.",sdgoop

It was tolerable while he was homeschooled but when he started working the fears around his flairs really started anxiety attacks that only make IBS-D much worse. It turned into constant stomach pain that nothing helped and he was getting super depressed. They did tons of tests, ruled out anything causing it, we started on a low fodmap diet and after reading reviews about this drug I asked his doctor if we could try it (though none of the other drugs they tried did much). First 10mg and now at 25mg before bed. It has been like a MIRACLE DRUG.

39,Amitriptyline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 7, 2019",45,I’ve suffered with very acute IBS for six years. The pain and discomfort plus all the associated symptoms have made my life very difficult. Had to take lots of time off work. Eventually saw a different specialist a few months ago who recommended Amitriptyline for IBS at a starting dose of 10 mg and slowly increasing to 30 mg.  The symptoms are greatly reduced and the pain is generally much more bearable. I’m still having flare ups so will keep increasing the tablets. It has given me my life back.  I can now make arrangements to go out and know that 99% of the time I’ll be ok to go. Such a great relief.

Pain was extremely constant and severe, at some point could not work for over a year, would literally spend weeks hunched over in pain with very few short pain-free breaks. After seeing dozens of medical and other specialists, gastroenterologists and taking every test imaginable, there was no organic cause, it was just IBS, C and mixed, but pain was predominant symptom. Amitriptyline was one of the last few meds to try as I feared it may make constipation worse. It's not a perfect solution but 100mg a day definitely makes a notable positive difference.

The pain would get so severe at times, it triggered a vasovagal response, causing me to pour sweat, have insanely loud ringing in my head, and nearly faint. My whole body felt so strange and weak. I don't know how IBS can cause such horrible pain, or how an antidepressant can stop it, but it does, and it has. Amitriptyline has changed how I spend my days. No more brutal pain and minimal episodes of diarrhea. I hope I never have to stop taking it.

I've never done that in my entire life, and it was pretty scary feeling so out of control. So I started taking it much earlier - around 6pm - and have had no drowsiness since. There are other more subtle side-effects; I feel sort of ""spaced out"" most of the time; a bit out-of-body. I think this is the anti-depressant side (I don't have depression) kicking in and I don't like the feeling at all.
