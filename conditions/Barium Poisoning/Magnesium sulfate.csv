0,Magnesium sulfate,Barium Poisoning,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2018",5,"This is, in my opinion, a last resort for a serious bout of constipation that is pretty much guaranteed to relieve you. Iâ€™ve found it works best when one max dose is taken once a day for 2 days as opposed to one max dose every 6 or hours or so like the directions say. That gives your body time to utilize it and produce a complete bowel movement that is not painful.",HUNYBDGER
