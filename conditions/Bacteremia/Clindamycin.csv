0,Clindamycin,Bacteremia,1,,"July 12, 2019",3,"Was prescribed clindamycin to treat tooth infection after pulling tooth. WORST drug ever. I couldn’t walk straight for days, dry mouth and down there. Don’t ever take this drug please people!!!  Pick something else but not this.",Ester
1,Clindamycin,Bacteremia,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2018",4,"I was prescribed for this drug after a severe bacterial infection was detected in my blood. The symptoms quickly went away as soon as I started taking the capsules. However, am still having diarrhea-which wasn't there previously-two weeks after completing my dose. Thing is, this diarrhea is preceded by  a gut wrenching pain that feels like air is being forcefully blown through my entrails. Plus I have some funny taste in my mouth that has forced me to keep and chew candy 24/7. All in all, it is a good drug if it treats that which caused the Doc to prescribe it in the first place. Just be prepared to handle the side effects for a while.",Yaddah
