9,Cyanocobalamin,B12 Nutritional Deficiency,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 30, 2012",29,"45-year-old female, have felt tired for years, as if I always needed more sleep, no matter how much I was able to get. Afraid of needles and not looking forward to giving myself shots, I put off going back to the Dr. for months after my blood work revealed a severe B12 deficiency. Wish I had not, the shot was painless, a tiny needle and easy to do at home. Results are excellent for me, within 3-4 days I was clear-headed in a way I have not felt for years, I do not feel like I needed more sleep all the time! Not implying an overly energetic or a high-type feeling, I just felt normal. The hereditary dark circles under my eyes seem to be lighter too. For me, the results are a dramatic improvement and the medication is very easy to use.",ashley2
