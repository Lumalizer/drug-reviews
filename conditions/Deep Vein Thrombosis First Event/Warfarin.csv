0,Warfarin,Deep Vein Thrombosis First Event,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 1, 2020",9,"Coumadin (warfarin):Put on Coumadin in 2008 after DVT, which ultimately turned out to have been caused by a hereditary clotting disorder (Factor V Leiden). No problems or side effects since, works like a charm. I self test every 2 weeks with Roche PT/INR handheld blood test kit, and manage to stay in therapeutic range about 95% of the time. Couldnâ€™t ask for much better!",Scotty
1,Warfarin,Deep Vein Thrombosis First Event,,,"July 2, 2016",14,"I did not realize that warfarin would have this side effect of hair loss. I take 15 mg three times a week, and ten milligrams for four days. My hair  has not come out in clumps; however, I do notice my scalp. This is my 5.5 years if Coumadin and Lovenox. I started when I was 34 and now 40...for life.  I hope I do not lose clumps, but I mask it with a hair cut...just tell myself I am taking rat poison. I am allergic to all the new drugs. Doing better than most of you, but when I developed a blood clot in my underarm and  two veins deep in my chest...no surgery...took 2 years to actually eliminate the clot, but destroyed my left side of my body",Coumadinforlife
2,Warfarin,Deep Vein Thrombosis First Event,,,"June 12, 2011",17,Jantoven (warfarin):I am concerned about the weight gain after taking this medicine. I have gained over 30 pounds since I started having to take Jantoven almost a year and a half ago.,Anonymous
3,Warfarin,Deep Vein Thrombosis First Event,,,"November 16, 2009",46,Coumadin (warfarin):Everything that goes into the mouth has to be reviewed for interactions with this drug.  It can also cause swelling and hair loss.,Anonymous
4,Warfarin,Deep Vein Thrombosis First Event,10.0,,"November 15, 2009",11,"I am 23 and have been taking this for a year now.  After suffering from a blood clot in my leg last year, I found out that I have a blood clotting disorder that is caused by a genetic mutation and have to remain on a blood thinner permanently.  I have been taking Warfarin from the beginning and have had no side effects.  My uncle had tried Warfarin and suffered from a few side effects which prompted him to switch to Coumadin.  For the short time he was on Coumadin, he had no complaints.  I suppose it depends on the individual but the Warfarin has been working just fine for me and is very affordable.",Anonymous
5,Warfarin,Deep Vein Thrombosis First Event,10.0,,"October 23, 2009",64,"Coumadin (warfarin):I am male, 62 year old. Got a blood clot the entire length of my saphenous vein. I was put on generic warfarin first at 2.5mg/day. I got sweaty, headachy, and felt depressed. This went on for two weeks until I read reviews about Coumadin on this site. Switched to Coumadin. INR stabilized, sweats went away, and headaches went away in about 10 days.I know that Coumadin and Warfarin are supposed to be chemically the same molecule. I propose that the objective differences between these two drugs most likely can be accounted for by considering that one may have more pure isomers than the other.",qx
6,Warfarin,Deep Vein Thrombosis First Event,8.0,,"December 27, 2008",39,Coumadin (warfarin):Coumadin is very effective.  Home monitoring of INR with finger sticks helped with ease of use.,Anonymous
7,Warfarin,Deep Vein Thrombosis First Event,4.0,,"November 6, 2008",28,"This drug works well, but must be monitored very carefully and taken as prescribed.  I have been on this drug for blood clots in my legs and after surgery it has been prescribed as a preventative measure.My mother has been on this drug for about 17 years as a preventative measure for strokes after having a mechnicial heart valve.  As she has gotten older, the tendancy for her has been difficulties controlling INR at the recommended level. If you have any bleeding while on this drug get to the doctor.  Do not ignore it thinking it will pass AND be careful with what you eat and drink as this will impact how the drug works.",kitty62

9,Warfarin,Deep Vein Thrombosis First Event,8.0,,"October 8, 2008",8,"I have been on Warfarin for about 6 months now.  I had a kidney removed and later it was discovered through testing that I had a blood clot in my leg, therefore, my physician put me on Warfarin.  I have been up and down with my dosages as one time my INR was too high and then it's too low - as of now I am alternating doses every other day - I will see next week if that helps keep my INR steady.  I have not noticed any side effects from this drug, but I am also on a kidney drug which has given me quite a few side effects so maybe I just don't notice any from the Warfarin.",Anonymous
