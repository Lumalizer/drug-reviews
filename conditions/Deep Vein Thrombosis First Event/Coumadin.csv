0,Coumadin,Deep Vein Thrombosis First Event,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 1, 2020",9,"Put on Coumadin in 2008 after DVT, which ultimately turned out to have been caused by a hereditary clotting disorder (Factor V Leiden). No problems or side effects since, works like a charm. I self test every 2 weeks with Roche PT/INR handheld blood test kit, and manage to stay in therapeutic range about 95% of the time. Couldnâ€™t ask for much better!",Scotty

2,Coumadin,Deep Vein Thrombosis First Event,10.0,,"October 23, 2009",64,"I am male, 62 year old. Got a blood clot the entire length of my saphenous vein. I was put on generic warfarin first at 2.5mg/day. I got sweaty, headachy, and felt depressed. This went on for two weeks until I read reviews about Coumadin on this site. Switched to Coumadin. INR stabilized, sweats went away, and headaches went away in about 10 days.I know that Coumadin and Warfarin are supposed to be chemically the same molecule. I propose that the objective differences between these two drugs most likely can be accounted for by considering that one may have more pure isomers than the other.",qx
