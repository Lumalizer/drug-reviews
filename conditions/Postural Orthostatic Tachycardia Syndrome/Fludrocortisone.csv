0,Fludrocortisone,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 28, 2021",1,I have been taking fludrocortisone for over 10 years now it has been the only thing that does help me with my POTS. I take 1 tablet daily and two if I’m feeling worse which helps my blood pressure come up from its super super low days which are very common for me. I do have concerns always about the long term use of this and how it’s affecting my body. My doctors never seem to bring it up for monitor my blood work. Which I’ve read they are suppose to be monitoring closely with long term use. I do have bad insomnia from this medication and restlessness. I have other issues but you just never know if that the meds or the POTS. But it’s the only thing that helps me and I wish there was more they could do to help others POTS.,Cortni
1,Fludrocortisone,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 22, 2021",4,"I was on it for 2 weeks at 0.1mg, then 1 more week at 0.2mg. It really helped with raising my blood pressure to a healthy level and reducing POTS symptoms. Unfortunately, I had to go off of it (tapered gradually with doctor’s advise) because it caused depression, irritability, rapid mood swings, intense agoraphobia, and psychotic symptoms. (I am treated for PTSD and bipolar disorder and have been stable for over 2 years, so some of them weren’t new symptoms, but they were symptoms I hadn’t experienced in a very long time.) I’m normally really comfortable with toughing out side effects for the benefit of a medication, but I couldn’t tough those ones out. If you have a history of mental illness, or if you have a sibling or parent with mental illness, please make sure your doctor knows that and consider asking about alternatives. It’s a great medication for those who need it and it did really help with POTS, but the side effects were not worth it for me personally.",POTSPatient
2,Fludrocortisone,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 21, 2021",2,"I am still on a low dose of this medication, so I can't say yet whether it is going to help my orthostatic intolerance (OI) and suspected low blood volume.In the meantime, I wanted to report the side effects on my sense of taste. In the first two weeks, I had a metallic taste in my mouth. In the second two weeks, I had a bicarb taste in the back of my throat/nose. Now I am also getting a reduction in my sense of taste. I can't taste sweet or umami very well. Orange juice and roasted vegies are okay, but everything else tastes cardboardy.I really hope that this side effect goes away, or the fludrocortisone starts working. Being unwell and also being hit with side effects and no benefits is hard. If the tablets were fixing my OI, I could probably live with the hypogeusia.",SallyS
3,Fludrocortisone,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 25, 2020",15,I experienced depression during the first week on fludrocortisone.

5,Fludrocortisone,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 16, 2020",9,"I’ve been on fludrocortisone 0.1 for almost four years. It’s the only thing out there that helps me not feel like I’m about to die everyday. I suggest not taking any probiotics with it ..  probiotics weakened my dose.

6,Fludrocortisone,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 1, 2020",71,Before this medication my heartrate was in the 160s upon waking and stayed that way everyday. I had severe anxiety from the adrenal dumps and was a miserable mess. I was labeled a hypochondriac with severe depression and anxiety even though this had only been going on for 6 months. I had 4 suicide attempts because I was so miserable and nobody believed something else was wrong. Finally my new Psychiatrist said they thought I had POTS. It took three Psych hospital stays. A dozen trips to the ER and one incredible Psychiatrist to save my life. I take .01mg of Fludrocortisone twice a day. My quality of life is almost back to normal. My heart rate rests between 70-100. I'm weaning off of Xanax and am no longer pegged as a hypochondriac. My depression and anxiety are minor and I am going back to school in the fall for my Bachelor's. This medication gave me my life and my sanity back.,Potswarrior

8,Fludrocortisone,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 25, 2019",31,"Florinef (fludrocortisone):I have been ""sick"" as long as I can remember. I passed out for the first time when I was 14. I've always had the ""I feel like I have the flu, and I'm dying symptoms"". I did not have a good quality of life. I was diagnosed with POTS and NMH  (Neurally Mediated Hypotension) in April of 2018 and immediately put on medicine. The first medicine have me awful side effects, so I was switched to Fludrocortisone. This medicine has changed my life. I can not live without feeling like I'm sick all the time. The only times I feel sick now are when I forget my medicine, or I go too long between meals. The only negative side effect is, I've gained 14 pounds so far, which sucks, but it's better than the alternative.",Jay Dee

10,Fludrocortisone,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 9, 2018",16,I had been having chest pain for months. Treated it with antibiotics twice and then steroids. Finally I saw my cardiologist who felt it was my out of control POTS. I went up to 0.2 mg and the chest pain went within a week. I am now down to 0.1 mg but I miss it I get the chest pain straight back. I also feel that my head is a great deal clearer. Less brain fog even though I had not been aware of it before.,Ladiva

12,Fludrocortisone,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,3,,"December 6, 2016",29,"Florinef has definitely helped the symptoms from POTS/Vasovagal Syncope. But what it has also done is create a steady weight gain to the tune of 25 lbs to which I'm miserable with. I've work with a nutritionist to prevent diabetes, I work out 5 times a week, and have not so much lost a pound of it. This drug has awful side effects for some of us, which for me is weight gain, and mood swings. I'm working to get off of it, assuming my adrenals don't crash from the prolonged use. These side effects of this medication for long term use are extremely dangerous and it shouldn't be on the market.",Weight Gain on Florinef
