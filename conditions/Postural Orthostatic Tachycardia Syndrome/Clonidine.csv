1,Clonidine,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,2,,"March 25, 2019",7,This drug is spendy and if you lose one patch or falls off ..good luck getting insurance to cover! It is outrageous. I was on it for Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Side effects are awful and mix with Anti Depressants or Anxiety sleep meds I've been having awful withdrawals for months and vomiting n retching for 7 weeks Do not use this Patch!,Dee
