0,Bupropion,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,9.0,,"January 24, 2020",17,"My dysautonomia returned a year ago. heart palpitations and syncope gave me anxiety. Anxiety caused more symptoms. I got stuck in a loop, lost 20lbs (I wasn't overweight). I couldn't care for my kids. I couldn't even bend over to pick something up or stand over heat (cooking/washing dishes) without symptomsI tried meds. On Midodrine & Escitalopram (Lexapro) I improved slightly. 6 months ago I exchanged the Escitalopram for BupropionMy symptoms faded immediately! I've continuously gotten better on it. I did pysch therapy. I can now walk/jog 2 miles in half an hour. A year ago I couldn't get up off the couch or look at a bloody nose without syncope/palpitations. I'm 90% back to normal on days I'm rested, fed, hydrated, medicated adequately. If I get lazy on one of these components I'm illI saw some studies saying Fluoxetine (Prozac) and  Paroxetine (Paxil) are effective in treating orthostatic hypotension. Is there a link between autonomic dysfunction and seratonin/dopamine?",So
1,Bupropion,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 19, 2018",13,I'm positive wellbutrin is what brought my Hyperadrenergic POTS to a debilitating level.,Heidi
2,Bupropion,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 2, 2014",19,"I'm baffled as to why bupropion is helpful with orthostasis, but for me, it has been. I can confirm that now because my doctor took me off it in case it was contributing to hypertensive spikes (--I have hyperadrenergic POTS). I don't know about that, and especially because I'm on a new beta blocker too, but I'm back to that slightly sweaty, slight swaying feeling when I stand, and my standing pulse pressure (difference between systolic and diastolic figures) narrows more now with standing.",Swaying
3,Bupropion,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 28, 2012",41,"This is the only medicine that has really been able to effectively manage my POTS symptoms. It is literally the reason I can get out of bed in the morning. I can play sports again, stay awake in class, I don't always feel 100% while doing it, but I feel good enough. It works well because unlike other depression medications prescribed to POTS patients, it directly stimulates the Central Nervous System. It's amazing how much better I have felt since I started it.",P.O.T.S.
