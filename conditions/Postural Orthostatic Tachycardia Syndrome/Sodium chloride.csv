0,Sodium chloride,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 9, 2021",0,I receive two 1000ml bags of sodium chloride every day through a Bard Power Port. It has been the only way to keep my blood volume up. I have gastroparesis and malabsorbtion and some autoimmune disorders. This has kept me from so many ER visits. I am thankful my Dr. worked with me. I also take Fludrocortisone to raise my blood pressure.,Katherine1977
