0,Promethazine,Anaphylaxis,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 12, 2019",1,"So I had an extremely bad reaction to bethahistine that I got prescribed for dizziness.... my face, lips and tongue got swollen up I was having sensitivity to light and noise. Was puking and diarrheaing the whole time, Got majorly hot head and headache, Got weak, tingly and twitchy. Was having trouble breathing for 2 days and didn’t go into emergency till the next day and they did nothing to help.  I was feeling a little less hypersensitive the next day but still so dizzy and still having diarrhea and cramps, I couldn’t walk so I went to emergency again. They gave me Promethizine and it’s kind of helping the dizziness but still feeling horrible from that reaction.",Jk123
1,Promethazine,Anaphylaxis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 22, 2018",3,"I just went thru 3 months of idiopathic anaphylaxis. But this time round l also had terribly itchy rashes as well. I had myself hospitalised the first time just to refresh and update new meds. None of the non drowsy antihistamines worked and l had at least 9 Epipen episodes. The Dr put me on a one off 100 mg of cortisone also. Apparently my potassium was low so l got an IV dose of that too. I saw many specialists and none could help. My GP suggested l cut down on food containing histamine, l didn't even know it did. After doing that l had no more anaphylaxis but still got some itchies. Phenergan saved my life",Celery Neck
