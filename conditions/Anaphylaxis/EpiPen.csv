0,EpiPen,Anaphylaxis,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 8, 2021",0,"Thank goodness I haven't used this, but I prefer carrying this brand to the generic because it has a simple way to use it (one cap) and a practice model so I know that I, my child, and whoever is taking care of them knows how to use it properly.",Mom
1,EpiPen,Anaphylaxis,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 20, 2019",1," I don't like the packaging the shape just looks wrong in your pocket??? There are better, cheaper alternatives that don't look like that pocket 24/7.",aaaaaaaaaa
2,EpiPen,Anaphylaxis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 29, 2017",3,"This medication was literally a life saver for me. I have had severe allergies to peanuts since I was a child. I mean, where I couldn't even touch peanut m&ms because they had peanuts inside the chocolate shells or sit in a seat at one of those places where you throw peanut shells on the floor or whatever as you eat them. I have had to use my epipen in that situation once (because I didn't want to seem different and I didn't think that just sitting in a seat, which I assumed had been wiped off) would affect me. I have also had to use it visiting my parents when my grandfather was alive because he loved peanuts and I'd sit where he's sat and had to use it again. I always carry two on me at all times.",Gastroparesis Girl
