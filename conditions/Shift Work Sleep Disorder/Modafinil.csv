0,Modafinil,Shift Work Sleep Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 9, 2021",1,"Worked remarkably well at the beginning. Then efficacy seemed to decline in a linear fashion, minimal efficacy after 1 month. That was taking it daily, so might help using it less frequently or just use it as needed to avoid tolerance.Surprising 'side-effect', it significantly reduced chronic pain. Trouble I have with my ankles that makes me limp but that doctors can't figure out why, this seemed to alleviate that 75%. Came back after I stopped using the drug for 2 weeks though. The efficacy of painkilling didn't decline like it did for wakefulness.",Googaholic
1,Modafinil,Shift Work Sleep Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 13, 2021",2,"I have ADHD, Shift work disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome. I started out with 100 mg and it took away so much of my pain! It also gave me a lot of energy! I felt like a normal person again! I could actually concentrate and think straight straight! With ADHD and chronic fatigue syndrome it's a handful itself but as a NOC shift worker, well that's just the cherry on top. I held on to the medication for about 3 months because I had no idea what to think. I was actually afraid to take it because I had never heard of it before but my doctor said it would help a lot of my issues! Well let's just say I wish I wasn't so afraid and anxious of new things, I wish I had tried it when I first got it! If you have any of the issues that it helps please give it a try! If you want to feel normal again!",PersianLove
2,Modafinil,Shift Work Sleep Disorder,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 19, 2020",8,"Provigil (modafinil):I was originally put on Provigil 15 years ago for shift work sleep disorder but I'm now on it for the fatigue that comes with MS.  My dose is 200 mg once a day worked well for me, but a new doc switched me to Nuvigil which isn't working well at all. I have to say there is a big difference between Provigil brand and the generic Modafinil. Modafinil is m much weaker and I often needed 400 mg a day depending on what I had to do.",Thor283
3,Modafinil,Shift Work Sleep Disorder,,,"December 11, 2019",24,"Modafinil saved my life! I have had hypersomnolence my entire life. I could easily sleep 4 days straight and wake up confused, dehydration, and guilty for missing my children's school performances, graduations, holidays, vacations etc.  @ almost 37 y/o I was finally diagnosed and prescribed modafinil. From day one I woke up @ 5am. I cleaned my house, got my hair and nails done, took my kids to and from school, scheduled appts that I should've schedule months ago, cooked dinner, and had a wonderful outlook. I went to sleep around 10pm. The next day I woke up @ 5am.and stay awake, happy and productive all day! This has continued from day one!!!!! This med is magic for me. I'm so grateful. My only wish is that I had been dx'd 30 years ago!",Anonymous
4,Modafinil,Shift Work Sleep Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 28, 2018",4,"I love this stuff it keeps me alert and awake when I take it and has one major benefit. I always suffer from heart palpitations constantly all day long. My cardiologist ran every test he could and said my heart is perfectly healthy and that my palpitations are probably genetic since my father has them as well. When I take Modafinil my palpitations come to a stop, I will get about 6 hours palpitation free then they slowly come back as the meds ware off. I haven't checked with the cardiologist to see if he knows why this happens but it sure is nice to not feel my heart jumping every few minutes.",templeofdooom
5,Modafinil,Shift Work Sleep Disorder,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 15, 2017",2,Great stuff to stay awake and keep alertness throughout the night. It's a lifesaver for me. I use to pass out driving home every morning. Now I make it home safe.,Entity247
6,Modafinil,Shift Work Sleep Disorder,9.0,,"November 15, 2017",5,"I work long hours at an ED in a small Swiss community hospital. Had bad trouble staying awake. I took everything - caffeine pills, OTC ephedrine at high doses, on the end even tramadol, ritalin and benzos. Modafinil helped me get off these pills - with 200 mg I can stay awake a whole busy 14-hour shift. As side effects I noticed some mild headaches, dehydration, nausea and kind of mild aggression. In Switzerland it's off label and only for narcolepsy, therefore you have no insurance coverage. 100 mg generic modafinil from TEVA are 2.50 CHF or so (about 2.45 USD), guess it's worth it.","T., anonym"
7,Modafinil,Shift Work Sleep Disorder,8.0,,"September 17, 2017",29,"Provigil (modafinil):Works pretty good but doses only cover 8 hrs.  Because my shifts start at 5 am and can end anywhere to 8:30 pm, I have to guess at my 8 hr. Window.     When I take 1.5 pills per day, I run out too fast and the pharmacy holds the script. Then I crash for several weeks until refill.  Nuvigi and provigil are true wonder drugs but I personally need 250 and 125 simultaneous as we go into a 24/7 society, I need covered at least 12 hrs.",Gdog1267
8,Modafinil,Shift Work Sleep Disorder,10.0,,"January 20, 2017",3,I dont even know where to start....  This Med is heaven sent.   I had trouble staying awake during the day.  I couldn't sit down for 20 minutes without dozing off and snoring like a chainsaw.  Going to the movies was a waste of time and money.  I was hesitant about taking this med as with any other meds but  I finally took the plunge after 1.5 years of online research and so glad I did.  I now stay awake all day without falling asleep everywhere I go.   If I could describe how I feel on this I would compare it to a time I was 13 years old wanting to go out and play street ball with my friends  where they are all there waiting for me to come out.  I was anxious but not in a negative way more like a kid waiting for xmas.,Pixi Stix
9,Modafinil,Shift Work Sleep Disorder,1.0,,"September 8, 2016",2,"This medication has always worked for me until this manufacturer.I get absolutely no benefit from this version of modafinil. My condition causes me to fall asleep at anytime, any place.Needless to say, this medication needs to be effective for my safety and the safety of others. ie...falling asleep while driving.",CPhT instructor
10,Modafinil,Shift Work Sleep Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 10, 2016",6,"I've been working 12 hour night shifts for 23 years. Started feeling excessive daytime sleepiness approximately 10 years ago, which has progressed to the point of fighting to keep my eyes open 24/7. Began taking modafinil 6 months ago and have noticed no difference whatsoever! If anything, it has gotten worse. I fear for my life (and everyone else around me!) every time I'm behind the wheel of my car. Working day shifts or changing jobs is absolutely not an option for me, as I have a special needs child that I need to be home with during the day. Have had every type of lab work known to man, all of which is normal. This zombie life is absolutely ridiculous and really wish someone had a solution!",Jen K.
11,Modafinil,Shift Work Sleep Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 30, 2015",11,"I first took Modafinil for shift work, but I also took it for fatigue, and depression. It worked great for all those conditions. I'm in my 60's and when I was young Docs gave me real amphetamines to lose weight. Amphetamines are a nightmare compared to Modafinil. Even though they give me the 200 mg tab. I never take 200 mg at once. I always break them in half and take 100 mg at a time. The worst thing is if you take it too late you can't sleep. But you need to sleep with Modafinil and you also need to eat with it. You feel better when you do. I give it a 10.",Thor283
12,Modafinil,Shift Work Sleep Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 13, 2015",54,Provigil (modafinil):I have been on and off Provigil a couple times over the past few years after being diagnosed with sleep apnea. I first started with 100mg and a CPAP machine. I soon began to feel better but the CPAP did not last because I kept ripping it off in the night. So I ended both. Recently I have gone back on Provigil taking 200mg for shift differential disorder because of the long shifts and my inability to stay awake and falling asleep driving. What a difference. I can stay awake for my 12 hour shift and the 1 hour drive each way to work. I feel if I had not gone back on it I most likely would have wrecked to or from work by now. Only down fall is an occasional upset stomach if I don't eat before or immediately after taking it.,sleepybush

16,Modafinil,Shift Work Sleep Disorder,10.0,,"September 3, 2011",50,Provigil (modafinil):I have sleep apnea. Sometimes I wake up feeling like I haven't had any sleep. In a fog so to speak. I have gone to sleep sitting at stoplights on the way to work in the morning. This medication does wonders. I still drink my coffee and it helps to boost the effects. I still get sleepy in the afternoon sometimes but I am able to fight it off much better. Before I couldn't and would go to sleep. It is just too expensive. ,Anonymous
