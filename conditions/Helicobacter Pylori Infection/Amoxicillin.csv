1,Amoxicillin,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 1, 2022",0,"I used amoxicillin to treat different problems on different occasions throughout many years. It never failed me, always helped, and I didn't have any side effects from it.  The last time I used it however to treat helicobacter pylori,  it gave me serious cramps and diarrhea. And for sure, it was not the other drug I used in conjunction, but amoxicillin, which surprised me to no end, because I never had such reaction to amoxicillin. I looked at the brand - it was Sandoz, that I didn't use before.  Had to switch the brand, in order to accomplish the treatment.  Then there were no problems - it worked as intended.",Firefly

An older Doctor treated the root cause, not the symptom with amoxicillin & Carafate. I haven't used any antacids for more than 5 years now, and have been enjoying all the foods I like, whenever I like. Thank God for old Doctors.",Okie John
