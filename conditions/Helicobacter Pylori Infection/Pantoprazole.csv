3,Pantoprazole,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,5.0,,"May 30, 2017",19,"I was prescribed Pantoprazole for H-pylori. I have experienced headaches, shortness of breath and awful metalic taste in my mouth. A recent visit to the Doctor, and I was found to have high blood pressure, so was put on Ramipril for that. The side effects were constant coughing to the point of vomiting. I looked up Ramipril only to find it was the source of the coughing, so called my M.D. to have it changed to a non ACE-inhibiter. Now I just did a search on the pantoprazole, -only to find that it can have a contraindication of high blood pressure! Bloody hell! Can't these M.D.'s do a simple research!? What a mess I'm in now. Would have been better off without either drug.",Dee557
