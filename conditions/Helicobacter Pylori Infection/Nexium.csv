0,Nexium,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2021",2,I don't usually write reviews but I think this will help someone out there. Nexium nearly finished me!!! 3 months of palpitations (high blood flow and high pulse rate) as if my heart will shut down the next minute. Can't sleep except aided by music. Can't sleep on my left side. Went for several ECGs (which always revealed trachycardia) then finally Echocardiogram which was quite revealing. Heart is okay but something keeps triggering my complaints. Doctor placed me on meds and ultimately by God's grace I'm okay now. If I sight this drug anywhere I will run,Reen
1,Nexium,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 16, 2021",2,"I hadn't realised that Nexium caused terrible headaches until I did a bit of research. The headaches started when I was being treated for HP and also on the days I took Nexium for stomach acid. The deal breaker was having to spend an entire day in bed (and a day off work) with such a painful headache I couldn't function. No over the counter pain relief helped with the pain, just sleeping it off. I throwing it in the bin and letting my GP know how I reacted!",Beating HPylori
