0,Clarithromycin,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,1.0,,"March 9, 2022",3,"On day 9 of 14 for H Pylori. Clarithromycin, Pantoprazole, amoxicillin, metronidazole and Peptobismal treatment. You will lesson a lot of symptoms if you eat with your antibiotics and take them as far apart in the day as possible. Also avoiding things that can cause stomach irritation like coffee, tea, chocolate, greasy food, acidic drinks like orange juice and soda. Side effects are pretty severe. Suffering with black tarry stools, stomach pain, dry mouth and throat, insomnia/fatigue, gastric bleeding, hemorrhoid flair up, ulcers in mouth, swollen sore throat and mouth, oral thrush, cough, reduced vision, the worse for me being my angry dry inflamed mouth and tongue.Doctor was not sympathetic in my symptoms, told me to take it anyways for the 14 days, otherwise I would have to do it again. In most people this won't cure the Pylori and you will have to do this again. Side effects so severe and painful I had a Covid test (negative). You can get reinfected by others saliva, etc.",Mary
1,Clarithromycin,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 2, 2022",0,"So after I had a check up scope with my IBD, the doctors found out that I had a few red irritation marks in my stomach. It wasn’t too bad, just very red and not suppose to be there. So they did a biopsy of them and it turned out I tested positive for h.pylori. But I never had any symptoms except a stomach cramp here or there. My GI doc put me on this drug therapy with clarithromycin, Lansoprazole, and two pills of Amoxicillin. I gotta take these four pills twice a day for ten days. Morning and night. My problem with it was the side effects. On my first day I suffered extreme nausea, heart racing and I did throw up that first night. Not to mention it makes it hard to sleep and having this bitter taste in my mouth that is there all day long. I started to use mint to help with this and now on my sixth day I am starting to get used to the side effects.",Chloe.Starr

3,Clarithromycin,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 27, 2021",0,"Worst pill ever, only managed one day, cause the second dose I took touched my throat and it literally started to swell on that side, my foot started to feel like it was going to cramp, then started to feel itchy, then I couldn’t sleep, woke up so nauseated and couldn’t even eat. Then saw I had a rash on my chest and my wife saw my neck and said I also had a rash, then later on my eyes literally went blurry on me that I had to rush out of the house. I don't like antibiotics, they do more harm then good. Also have no idea why I need these meds if I feel like my dietary change has controlled this bacteria. I needed a good nap and Thank God the weakness left. It did cause me a nasty anxiety I think the bacteria anxiety was nothing compared to the pill one. Good advice you can find doctors out there that would recommend natural medicine pills that actually have a higher rating and nothing of a side effect other then if you allergic to peanuts. Also you taking one pill to attack bacteria",DJspike

It seems to be helping but on day 7 of a 14 day regimen the heart rate issue started. It includes Protonix, clarithromycin and amoxcillin.  I noticed the increased heart rate, chest pain and shortness of breath on day 7. I didn’t know to prepare myself for this but it’s good to know I’m not alone. I suspect the heart rate issue started earlier but I take a BP medicine which lowers my heart rate so I didn’t notice it until I forgot to take my morning dose. Then it freaked me out but I did read it’s an uncommon side effect. I know things will go back to normal but I hope I make it until the 14th day.

Day 1-2 I had a a lot of anxiety about taking the meds, but had absolutely no side effects except dark stool. Day 3-7 I actually started feeling significantly better, but developed that bitter taste. Day 8-12 I started getting frequent panic attacks out of nowhere, fast heart rate, shakiness, weakness, feeling like I'm going to die, insomnia, brain fog, you name it. It really felt like someone took me out of my body and put me into a nightmare zone. I went to a pharmacist and they told me that clarithromycin couldn't be the cause, but a quick Google told me I wasn't alone. Day 13-14 were much more mild, definitely manageable. That being said, these side effects are the minority. I'm just another user that wasn't warned and was quite frightened.

The first three days were rough as I felt lightheaded and an increase in heart rate. (Resting heart rate between 95-105). I was also very itchy so I used benadryl to mitigate that.  But immediately I felt the dizziness go away and the indigestion got better on the third day. On day five, I got the horrible metallic taste in my mouth so I took a teaspoon of manuka honey after the doses.  Also take fiber and probiotics and ginger tea. That will help a lot.

A sense of relief came when I had to be tested and found that h pylori was causing all of this. Don't get me wrong, I hate that it has come to this but I'm relieved that it is something that can be treated without having to undergo long term treatment as I would have with GERD. I weighed my options and decided to overcome anxiety and take the meds to get rid of this thing. I have experienced the metallic taste, loss of sleep, back pains, dark stools, and brain fog. Push through!!! You can do this!!!

I am quite sensitive to medications and Clarithromycin hardly bothered me at all. The dizziness even faded after 3 days and I was able to function normally, even exercise.Also, some other advice, as I am a pharmacist. One person mentioned to take this with soda. I advise against that because soft drinks contain phosphoric acid and will likely exacerbate symptoms. Another notable interaction is milk products like ice cream. It helps for a short time, but then the rebound acid makes it worse.

I always ate yogurt twice a day with the medication as well as a meal so I my stomach wouldn't hurt or be upset. I never took the medication without food as  instructed so I never had any stomach problems at all. The only side effect I had was an odd taste in my mouth but it wasn't overwhelming or bothersome.",TrisKal

I've experienced no side of amox. but clar. is making my sinuses drip with an awful med taste that creeps up into my mouth and along sides of my tongue. Strange, but hopeful :).

I was in so much pain/ nausea that I got sent home from work and scheduled an appointment with a GI Dr. Today is much better, but I need to constantly have something easy in my stomach to not feel sick. I immediately got the metallic taste on my mouth and get a bit cotton-mouthy at night. Otherwise, no other major side effects.",HT25
85,Clarithromycin,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,5.0,,"March 20, 2015",16,I'm taking this medicine apart of a triple antibiotic therapy. It makes me so miserable that I feel like I'm dying. I hope it gets better but it sucks. I can't wait until I can throw the empty bottle away.,Couurrtnicole
86,Clarithromycin,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 17, 2015",28,Terrible taste in my mouth from this medication! It also dries you out! One of my chief complaints before being prescribed this med was a bad taste in my mouth. It was found to be from H Plylori. I do feel better in the stomach due to this medication but the horrible taste is way nasty!,rocket5
87,Clarithromycin,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 9, 2014",17,"I have taken clarithromycin on two separate occasions for treatment of Helicobacter Pylori both times. One time was approximately 7 years ago and then again about 3 years ago. I am about to start another round along with amoxicillin and bismuth, which is Pepto Bismol. Clarithromycin leaves a horrible metallic taste in my mouth. I am not looking forward to taking it again. The only thing that seemed to relieve this momentarily was chocolate. I kept Hershey's kisses with me all the time. I would even have to get up in the middle of the night and eat one. The taste was so bad that I couldn't even go back to sleep. A nurse told me that she had heard this worked. After eradication, try Oregano oil, grapefruit seed extract, and tumeric daily.",happyredhead

89,Clarithromycin,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,8.0,,"January 2, 2012",23,"Taking the PrevPak which is a mixture of clarithromycin, amoxicillin and Prevacid. When take the night time dose of the medications I experience metallic taste which lasts for awhile. In the morning I do not notice the metallic taste. I will start to try full meal and chocolate to see if the taste is not so obvious. Also going to get the big red gum cinnamon flavor and keep gum at my bedside when wake up to chew the gum. Grapefruit should not mixed with the antibiotic as it interacts with lots of antibiotics and medications.",Tisha79

In that 10 days I seem to be one that experienced negative side effects but continued on for the eventual benefit ""for me"". I experienced extreme fatigue, ringing in ears, forgetfulness, migraine headaches, nasty taste/smell. Had thrush at day 7 and day 10 is here.  Feel like I was hit by a truck. Have follow-up to see if H-pylori is gone, will come back to update.",cmp
