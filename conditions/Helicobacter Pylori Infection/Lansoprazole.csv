0,Lansoprazole,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 29, 2021",2,"I was prescribed a long-term use of Prevacid following a diagnosis for H. Pylori. It was originally used in a 3-treatment regimen which contained 2 antibiotics for H. Pylori when I was a teenager. H. Pylori was eliminated enough to prevent ulcers, but acid reflux did continue. This continuation led to a prescribed long-term use of Prevacid. Given the risks of long-term use of any PPI, over the course of several decades I personally reduced my dosage to as needed. I have success with week long dosage as found on the OTC bottle more so with Prevacid than other PPIs available. OTC gives the same results for me as the original prescription.",Kpak
1,Lansoprazole,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,8,,"November 21, 2016",17,"Initially prescribed Lansoprazole 30mg due to acid reflux.I took it for 3 days with side effects (diarhorroea, dry mouth and stomach pain), so I called my doctor and found out I had H Pylori.I had to continue taking Lanso. with Clarithromycin and amoxicillin for 7days (known as triple therapy). Honestly after taking the triple therapy, I began to have withdrawal symptoms. For some strange reason, I used to be really hungry when being on the medication. Not anymore.Dr. recommends I continue taking Lanso. 30mg once a day after the triple therapy until I ""feel better really"". I've been on Lans. for 4 days now after the therapy and I'm still experiencing sour, foul taste in the mouth, gassy bubbling in my digestive tract.. no hunger.",VincciW
