0,Rabeprazole,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 15, 2019",2,I tried OTC meds for a couple of years  for my tummy before they found the H. Pylori bacteria was causing my ulcer.  Rabeprazole was added during triple therapy with antibiotics and within a couple of hours my searing pain from abdomen through to my back was gone.  I should only have to take Rabeprazole for 2 months but insurance will not cover it.  I agree it works really well and should be covered by insurance.  I complained to the insurance and told them OTC's are not the same and don't work the same but got nowhere.,CB
