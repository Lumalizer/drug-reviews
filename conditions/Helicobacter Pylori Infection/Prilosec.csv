0,Prilosec,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 29, 2020",35,"I took Prilosec for a yr and a half.  I noticed that my whole body ached.  My bones hurt, if I bumped up against a door my arm was so sensitive.  I felt like I was 90 years old.  My joints ached and my face lost any glow.  My skin was dull, flat and pale.   Once I got off this, all those symptoms went away.  I have bad reflux, to where I couldn't swallow or yawn.  I now take apple cidar vinegar each morning and I'm fine.  I take a couple tea spoons with a splash of water in a small cup when I get up, and it works!  Get off Prilosec, it will age you prematurely!",Anonymous
1,Prilosec,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,8,,"August 13, 2015",36,Yes prilosec stopped my heartburn most of the time. I have been hospitalized after I stopped. I now have arthritis so badly in both my hips I have to have them both replaced. I'm only 44 years old. I've been taking the meds since I was 17. If I would had been diagnosed or even tested for H Pylori this could have been cured years ago and I wouldn't have to have my hips replaced. There is no arthritis that runs on either side of my family.,Arthritis Becca
