0,Flagyl,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 13, 2022",0,"The reviews I saw for this drug scared the hell out of me. I was dealing with stomach issues for months before finally going to the doctor for it. I had every symptom of H pylori and a blood test confirmed it. I started out with clarithromycin and I had an awful experience I had every single side effect. I switched to Flagyl. I had a 14-day treatment with one pill every 8 hours. I'm 19 and weighted 115. After the medicine, I now weigh 108 but feel better than I ever have before. YOU NEED THIS!! The treatment is not as bad as everyone says. Remember to take Probiotics. The first week was great, the only side effects I had were loss of appetite, diarrhea, and my urine was a much darker color. I never had a bad metallic taste but my tongue felt coated like something was constantly at the back of my throat. Eating and drinking helped with that. My GI doctor prescribed me protonx, zofran, and levsin before the treatment which seemed to really help while also taking the antibiotics.",survivehpylori

2,Flagyl,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 10, 2021",0,"One of the worst meds I've ever had the misfortune to use. In addition to making me feel continuously nauseous, it affects the saliva in your mouth. Your saliva is as if you have chewed on the most possible bitter thing you can think of.  Saliva is bitter 24/7 which in turn causes what little food you can tolerate taste wretched.Dosage was three times a day for 14 days. After day 7 days I reduced it to twice a day, which has helped the symptoms of nausea and bitter saliva a little, which is better than nothing. Otherwise I would have stopped taking it all together. I'm depending on the Clarithromyacin  to pick up the slack.",Stargazer 2222
3,Flagyl,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,,,"February 16, 2021",1,Metronidazole is dangerous drug and lots people having strange reactions to it,Frank
4,Flagyl,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,,,"August 20, 2020",3,Amoxicillin always was so hard on my stomach my stomach - more than h.pylori. A family member told me to get over it because they were an army med. do not get over it. The metronidazole shouldn’t make you feel this way and is truly the cure.,Cc
5,Flagyl,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,8.0,,"October 30, 2019",12,"I'm on day three  out of 1t day of taking a three tier medication schedule for h pylori, metronidazole, erythromyacin, and omeperazole. My doc suggested that I take one of the antibiotics, eat something, wait an hour, then take the second one. So far I’ve had no bad side effects, only a bad taste in my mouth.",DoxieMom
6,Flagyl,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 16, 2019",11,"The side effects from flagyl have been worse than my original symptoms of H pylori. Explosive diarrhea, bloating, loss of appetite, urgency and general discomfort. I have two days left of a 10 day/ 3 times a day cycle. I cannot wait for it to be over. Don't take this stuff unless you have to. It has been hard.",Bob
7,Flagyl,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 4, 2019",41,"I can't believe the complaints on here for a antibiotic that is going to heal your infection.  I am on Tetracycline, Flagyl, Bismuth and Lansaprazole,   I hope you all feel better. Drink lots of water and eat before you take this antibiotic. Love and Light",indigogirl
8,Flagyl,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 19, 2017",18,"I am now on day 7 of a 14. I'm on Metronidazole, Omeprazole & clarithromycin. I have had H-pylori 3 times with in a year. The treatment for me has been awful. The dosage was tripled and it has given me nausea, bloating, foggy memory, a white film on my tongue & fatigue. The metallic taste last all day. The thing that you need to be aware of is if you continue to get H-pylori like I have, it can be a precursor to stomach cancer. After this round of treatment I have taken the steps to see a gastroenterologist, to insist that he does an endoscopy, to ensure me that there isn't anything for me to be concerned with at this time. It's a very scary feeling to have gotten this infection at least 3 times within a year.",Anonymous
9,Flagyl,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 19, 2016",34,"I had a Duodenal Switch (a major weight loss surgery combining the vertical sleeve with rearranging one's intestines to minimize fat absorption) 9 yrs ago.  Since then I've had probs with gas and a stomach ulcer, both caused by H Pylori.  I've taken Flagyl twice.  I am now on Day 5 of this round, & I don't experience most of the side effects I see described.  (250 mg 3X per day) While the pill doesn't ""taste"" great, there are other meds that also don't, and I find this no more severe than those.  I don't  have a lingering bad taste.  I've had no diarrhea and have had more regular bowel movements.  I've had almost no gas.  My pain is gone.  I don't feel sick.  I am grateful for this drug!",Gassy
10,Flagyl,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 19, 2014",44,"Most horrible side effects: Bitter taste in mouth even hours after administration, balance problems, confusion, surroundings seem unreal, like walking in a dream ( not a good one) concentration problems, general malaise, not able to eat anything but oatmeal and mashed potatoes. Extreme weight loss.  Had to stop after 11 doses. Stomach worse then before.I have to add that I also had Amoxicillin and Protonix at the same time, maybe the combination was at fault for this extreme reaction.",Traude
