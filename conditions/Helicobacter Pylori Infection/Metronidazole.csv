1,Metronidazole,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 13, 2022",0,"Flagyl (metronidazole):The reviews I saw for this drug scared the hell out of me. I was dealing with stomach issues for months before finally going to the doctor for it. I had every symptom of H pylori and a blood test confirmed it. I started out with clarithromycin and I had an awful experience I had every single side effect. I switched to Flagyl. I had a 14-day treatment with one pill every 8 hours. I'm 19 and weighted 115. After the medicine, I now weigh 108 but feel better than I ever have before. YOU NEED THIS!! The treatment is not as bad as everyone says. Remember to take Probiotics. The first week was great, the only side effects I had were loss of appetite, diarrhea, and my urine was a much darker color. I never had a bad metallic taste but my tongue felt coated like something was constantly at the back of my throat. Eating and drinking helped with that. My GI doctor prescribed me protonx, zofran, and levsin before the treatment which seemed to really help while also taking the antibiotics.",survivehpylori

3,Metronidazole,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 31, 2021",0,I was diagnosed with h pylori for the second time in 5 years following a stool test confirming the bacteria. I was put on clarithromycin 500 mg metronidazole 500 mg and omeprazole 20 mg twice daily. The first couple of days went well just the bitter taste that everyone describes. I’m on day 6 of a 10 day treatment plan and today I feel so awful. I couldn’t sleep last night had severe insomnia stomach cramps and burning also anxiety. I hope that it’s just the pills getting rid of the bacteria because it was so random and I know these drugs are wreaking havoc on me. I hope this will be all worth it in the end.

In addition to making me feel continuously nauseous, it affects the saliva in your mouth. Your saliva is as if you have chewed on the most possible bitter thing you can think of.  Saliva is bitter 24/7 which in turn causes what little food you can tolerate taste wretched.Dosage was three times a day for 14 days. After day 7 days I reduced it to twice a day, which has helped the symptoms of nausea and bitter saliva a little, which is better than nothing. Otherwise I would have stopped taking it all together.

7,Metronidazole,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 13, 2021",1,"I began taking omeprazole, clarithomycin, metronidazole, and amoxicillin.

Side effects were just uncomfortable but not bad, diarrhea, insomnia, dizziness, metallic taste in mouth,  headache, heartburn, and nausea. My side effect symptoms come and go. Advice: If you are reading these experiences please try not to stress as much as everyone is different. I find that taking a probiotic helps a lot to reduce stomach discomfort and diarrhea. Make sure to eat light throughout the day and change your diet to mainly BRAT diet ( bland ) as well as prebiotic foods, this will let your ulcers heal as well as avoiding bloating and other stomach discomfort. Avoid alcohol at all costs as well as sugar and bread because they promote the growth of H pylori. Eat 2-4 hours before you go to bed or lay down and keep your head and torso propped up because it helps digestion as well as avoiding GERD symptoms.",KC

Could only handle fluids the day after stopping the regimen. Was set out to finish my 14 day course as would love to get rid of this bug once and for all but my body couldn't take it anymore.

But the first 3 days my stomach was burning. Make sure you take  a probiotic  2 hours before or after taking this medication. The reason for the stomach burn is that the good bacteria is being destroyed by the METRONIZOLE? so the probiotic replaces the good bacteria that has been lost. Also I take 3 pepto bismol  chewable tablets 1 hour before I take the medication - it really helps out so much.
