0,Omeprazole,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2021",3,"Given omeprazole 20mg (mostly 2 x day) when I had some painful burning sensation in the upper part of my stomach. I was with that for about 2 months while they find the root cause of my problem (I was having test and scans and all were normal). Problem was that all took so long (covid related delays). But then, found out I had Pylori. So I got the antibiotics treatment plus PPI (30mg twice a day) for a week. The doctor did not guide me if I should or not continue with omeprazole (and nothing at all on the side effects). So I stopped it after the Pylori treatment and then I had a horrible rebound of the acidity (and terrible back pain, constipation, dizziness that took me to A&E, lack of sleep, nervousness, fatigue, shortness of breath. Had this effects on and off also while having omeprazole). So back to omeprazole. In total had omeprazole for 9 weeks. Now day 7 after stopping it and feeling better but now dealing with rebound symptoms. CAUTION SHOULD BE GIVEN BEFORE TAKING THIS MED!!!",KarinaS

I finished the antibiotics on Tuesday the 18th of August but got told to carry on with my omeprazole twice daily, this tablets made me feel soo ill with , chills, dizziness, lack of appetite, brain fog, confusion, heart  palpitations, tingling in my arms and legs, adrenaline at night so used to be woken up with my heart racing for no reason, insomnia, very emotional , low mood, my skin completions has gone yellow/pale, knot in my throat.

2,Omeprazole,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 29, 2020",35,"Prilosec (omeprazole):I took Prilosec for a yr and a half.  I noticed that my whole body ached.  My bones hurt, if I bumped up against a door my arm was so sensitive.  I felt like I was 90 years old.  My joints ached and my face lost any glow.  My skin was dull, flat and pale.   Once I got off this, all those symptoms went away.  I have bad reflux, to where I couldn't swallow or yawn.  I now take apple cidar vinegar each morning and I'm fine.  I take a couple tea spoons with a splash of water in a small cup when I get up, and it works!  Get off Prilosec, it will age you prematurely!",Anonymous
3,Omeprazole,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,8,,"August 13, 2015",36,Prilosec (omeprazole):Yes prilosec stopped my heartburn most of the time. I have been hospitalized after I stopped. I now have arthritis so badly in both my hips I have to have them both replaced. I'm only 44 years old. I've been taking the meds since I was 17. If I would had been diagnosed or even tested for H Pylori this could have been cured years ago and I wouldn't have to have my hips replaced. There is no arthritis that runs on either side of my family.,Arthritis Becca
4,Omeprazole,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,6,,"July 23, 2011",31,"Am about halfway through H. Pylori treatment on this medication, have noticed trouble sleeping, fatigue, and dizziness. Also, be very careful if you take benzodiazepines with this medication; it can greatly increase the side effects of sedatives like that.",Anonymous
