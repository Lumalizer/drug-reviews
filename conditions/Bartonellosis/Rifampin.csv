0,Rifampin,Bartonellosis,10,,"December 9, 2011",15,Wonderful antibiotic for Bartonellosis! Few side effects compared to some other antibiotics. High bilirubin levels is usually transient and just needs to be monitored. Has a very short half-life compared to Mycobutin but far less chance of getting a serious side effect. Much easier and less serious side effects than Bactrim.,Anonymous
