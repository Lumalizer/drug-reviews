1,Doxycycline,Bartonellosis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 15, 2020",0,"Seems like it started with sinus. Low grade fever, cough, seems like I had this for months but just got worse. I ended up with very short of breath. Just walking a short distance. Had to try clearing my throat every morning then felt better. Finally got a script for Doxycyline  and it didn't take long for my shortness of breath to to become so much better so I could do things I didn't think I could do again.",Trish
