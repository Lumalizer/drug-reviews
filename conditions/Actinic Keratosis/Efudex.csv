Extreme pain, care must be taken when showering, I used lukewarm water on my face, I found this helped but then the skin went tight .After applying Efudix, I waited an hour or so before applying a moisturiser ( Nivea for men sensitive alcohol free) Sleep is extremely difficult due to the terrible itch - scratch - itch !Week 4 .I had to stop using Efudix ! swollen face, half closed eyes ,however it has definitely worked with blistering ,weeping and peeling beginning. Because of the swelling around my eyes, I rang my Doc and we agreed to cease any further application as the Efudix has done the job! I am now experiencing bouts of severe itching - tried all sorts of lotions and potions but alas no relief, Nivea seems to give a little relief .I've read you often worse when you stop using Efudix and it's true!",Jim
1,Efudex,Actinic Keratosis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 20, 2022",0,"I had zero unpleasantness. I am in week 4, prescription was to use once a day for three weeks, break then another 3. The second week in I started twice a day on hands and arms and nose. Side of my face did not look good , maybe headache first week. But no pain. Back of the hand slowly working . Will stop then wait 3 weeks and go again. No pain or side affects",Tyorke1
2,Efudex,Actinic Keratosis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 10, 2021",0,"I'm using Efudex on my forehead - the second time that I have been asked to treat this area for AK - although previously I was prescribed a stronger lotion that had a more sudden reaction. Anyway I am now in week 3. My forehead feels very tight and hot (Some discomfort sleeping) & yes it feels sore and looks awful with very red blotches. What is surprising is the patches being worked on are lower on my forehead than I anticipated - I had felt the sun damage areas higher up on a receding hairline but not these just above and to the sides of my eyebrows. Yes, it is painful and looks horrid (but shows that it's working) but I've invested in a flat cap to hide at least some of the horrors. I also volunteer at a Cancer charity so know that staff and probably customers too, will be understanding whilst treatment is ongoing. I encourage everyone to try to keep going and to stay the course, but of course to speak with your GP or the skin clinic if you are finding it v hard. Take care folks!",Norfolk
3,Efudex,Actinic Keratosis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 7, 2021",2,"Used Efudix full face treatment for AK and Bowens disease. Twice daily for three weeks. I was one who suffered severe reaction. From week two I suffered intolerable pain for three weeks. My face was a total mess of raw flesh. Sleeping impossible.  Pillow and sheets stained with body fluids seeping from face. Sent me into a depression for 3 months. Worst experience of my life. Having said that the results were fantastic. Baby smooth blemish free skin [age70]. I am glad I perserved BUT I recommend the following. Do not do the whole face at once. Break it up into halves which reduces pain and makes sleeping easier, That pillow really hurts. Do not get it in eyes nose mouth genitals etc as believe me you will suffer! Put only thin film on as thats all you need. If Doctor states used for three weeks but you start to ulcer and erode at two weeks then stop because your done, don't extend the agony.Mine is the worst case scenerio. You experience may vary. Good luck.",Aussieguy

5,Efudex,Actinic Keratosis,,,"August 20, 2021",2,The reviews posted are really helpful as I am two weeks into a 4 week course and the effects of the cream were giving me concern. But looking at other peoples experience I am much relieved and will now see the course through. As with others by applying the cream it has exposed more damaged areas of my face I wasn’t aware of. Two weeks into the application all areas are red blotches some of which are ulcerated and very painful. At night I’m having to have the electric fan directed at my face for a cooling effect as it’s on fire. With broken sleep and the pain it’s hard going but having read the reviews it’s seems it is normal so I will stick it out.,Anonymous

I am supposed to apply once daily for two weeks, then take 2 to 3 weeks off, and apply again daily for two weeks.  I had one basal cell carcinoma on my lower leg two years ago. I used the Aldara cream on that, and did not like it at all. I had systemic side effects and burning, painful skin for 23 weeks.  I am hoping this experience with fluorouracil will be better.",Pip

I have fair skin. I was told it was pre cancerous .Applied the cream as directed but after two weeks treatment I started to become increasingly unwell, and by the end of 28 days had horrible gastric and bowel symptoms. I even had a test to make sure that I was not missing DPD as I was so badly affected even two weeks after stopping treatment .I recovered thankfully and the spot on my cheek healed well, but I wouldn't go through it again. I'd opt for cryosurgery or surgery even if it left a small scar .This cream is seriously toxic to pets incidentally, so please be very careful with it .",Cardigran

My face is very red and itchy, it's amazing how the cream identifies areas of damage.  It's been tough at times, sleepless nights with burning/itching.  Strangely when I stopped applying the cream I suffered stomach acid, unsure if its relayed.  The biggest challenge is to persevere to the end.  I use Aquaphore from Amazon to soothe the itching.

The treatment on the head was itchy and  at the end  painful- the 2nd treatment did not show any remaining AKs.  I could see that some of the 'rash' raised by the drug extended to my face so I started a treatment there. This was  more painful - particularly round the mouth and cheeks as these move if you smile or speak. I am in the healing phase now and will start a second treatment in 2 weeks.

13,Efudex,Actinic Keratosis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 8, 2020",48,"Male 52, having had ongoing AK issues on scalp and face, regularly frozen with dry ice over past several years. Started using Efudex 2x daily on scalp for past 3 weeks; some mild irritation but not at all problematic; after 2 weeks crusty areas fell away (I did slightly agitate which I know I shouldn't) and will continue to use for another 1-2 weeks. So far so good, material improvement in scalp and tenderness has subsided substantially. Now starting to try small area on forehead below hairline, before doing entire face...just to see if reaction is very different, but this is just SO much better than having intermittent freezing. Will definitely do a second cycle on scalp after a break. Highly recommend based on 3 weeks' usage. Will update further after using on face. Thanks for all the other posts !",Philip
14,Efudex,Actinic Keratosis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 29, 2020",46,"I am 70, with chestnut hair, fair skin and blue eyes. My doctor diagnosed actinic keratosis on a small lesion on my face. He recommended Efudix twice a day for 3 weeks. I used a cotton bud to apply the cream as it seemed easier to apply it thinly that way than with my finger. During the first two weeks the lesion started to become red and enlarged slightly. Towards the end of the second and throughout the third week yellowy crusts started to form and the lesion felt tender and raw. If I went out in the sun I put a small plaster over it for protection. After the treatment a scab formed over the whole area that took two weeks to fall off. Then new skin appeared and I have been applying Calendula to aid the recovery. I am left with a pink streak which hopefully will fade with time. Until then I will use a 'hide the blemish' make-up which I would think a man could also use, if need be. Overall very pleased with the result.",Isobel

I was actually prescribed the cream two other times and chickened out due to the photos that I had seen on YouTube. I am doing very well so far. It is super tight and red around my mouth, very hard to smile. I have spots all over my forehead and a few on my cheeks. It’s always a shock to see my face in the mirror. But without looking at myself it feels like I put on one of those peel off face masks just tight. So far I sleep just fine. I don’t however use Vaseline I use calendula it’s for burns and has worked well. I have also used makeup when I had to go out in public. It is definitely convenient being in lockdown because everyone is wearing a mask so it hides my super red chin. I have  6 more days of cream, I am taking this one day at a time.

I'm on my fourth facial using it. I can last 16 days at the most. I would be so painful if I used it for 28 days. I know it's time to stop when it is so itchy that I don't get a single minute of sleep at night. I have to stay at home for 3 or 4 weeks - I scare too many people otherwise.  Before bed I have to take mild sleeping tablets (Restavit) and ibuprofen. I used to use Lucas Pawpaw ointment at night, but it's too thick and itchy.  I use Dermeze treatment ointment. Lucas' is good for recovery. I have to wash the Efudex off before I go to sleep - otherwise I can feel its horrible burning all night. If I accidentally touch the treated spot and then rub my eyes, they get swollen for days. I hate the treatment (0/10) - torturers could use it.  But I love the results (10/10).

I'm going to stop at the weeks end for a full 4 weeks. I also treated some specific spots on the side of my face but it just got very red, turned blackish, I stopped that at 3 weeks and it is healing nicely with the help of vaseline.

24,Efudex,Actinic Keratosis,10.0,,"January 20, 2020",55,"I am grateful for Efudex, although the treatment is quite difficult, because it is effective, comprehensive and empowering! Skin cancer surgeries are another kind of difficult I hope to avoid! I’ve used Efudex three times on my face...the first two weeks are the easiest, the second two are more challenging. Plan to stay at home week 4 and the first week of healing. If you are using around your mouth, it will be hard to comfortably eat and drink. Eat soft foods and use a straw. With supervision, my doctor directed me to use Efudex on my lips, which was the most challenging of all applications! Because lips are a more sensitive area, I only needed to apply for 7-10 days....I made it to 8 and could do no more. No doubt Efudex is challenging to use, but it beats multiple surgeries where hunks of your face are removed! I plan to use in the future where issues emerge....because the bad cancer causing cells will keep appearing. And, now I can do something when they do!",Florida Redhead
25,Efudex,Actinic Keratosis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 18, 2020",46,"I was prescribed Efudex for basal carcinoma on my leg. Used twice a day for 3 weeks.  Excellent result. Now 6 weeks on and just left with red area which I assume will fade with time.  I was also told to treat AK on my face, used cream once a day for 4 weeks (stopped 3 days short).  As with other comments made, I was not informed by the dr that I would look absolutely monstrous.  Immediate reddening of the entire face, followed by scabbing.  Still at the scabbing stage. I could get a part in a horror movie. The cream seemed to migrate towards my eyes where I had not applied it.   Would I have used Efudix if I had known what I would look like - probably wouldn’t have had the courage as people stare when I am out and about. Determined to continue with my life as normal.

So, you never know how your own skin will react. The dermatologists have been amazed at the length of time it takes me to get a reaction. But for the chest area, the reaction is incredibly painful, red, and fast.

(rosacea is like acne, it comes and goes but only in the place where I used the efudix, it's embarrassing and I don't like going in public during flare ups.)I wouldn't recommend this treatment at all. It might be ok on small 2cm spot treatments on the body, NOT THE FACE. Beware",Lough
40,Efudex,Actinic Keratosis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 28, 2016",45,"Dear the a: I have widespread actinic keratosis on my forearms. I was prescribed Efudex. I have thin, fair skin and some freckling. The damage seems to have occurred from a childhood playing outdoors, before sunscreen became so important. The Efudex, astonishingly, did nothing. So very disappointing. The dermatologist was equally surprised, and prescribed another round. Still nothing. And no one can give me an answer.  I am now considering a chemical peel or whatever the next step might be. So very tired of hiding my arms. Good luck to you. If anyone can give you an answer, please, please post it here.",the b1
41,Efudex,Actinic Keratosis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 15, 2016",93,"I was prescribed Efudex to treat various Actinic Keratoses on my forehead and balding front pate. Firstly my overall rating is that the treatment is very effective and I now have a beautiful forehead of smooth skin after 2 weeks 2 days of treatment and 2 weeks of recovery post treatment.It may be that my skin damage was mild. In any event I found the process quite bearable.I applied the cream sparingly night and morning and there was little to see for 3 or 4 days, skin then reddened and peeled/flaked - no ulceration or discharge. Although unsightly (looked like a bright rash) as a male I was still happy to go out and socialise. I used my wife's hair colourant  plastic protective gloves but still washed hands thoroughly after use. Happy.",cooloperator
42,Efudex,Actinic Keratosis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 12, 2015",160,"I am a 70 year old male who suffers from Actinick Keratosis from exposure to the harsh rays of the sun. Efudex is a fantastic product. Does exactly what is claimed. Make sure that you wash your hands completely after each application. Do not get it on your lips or you will experience great discomfort, (cracked and bleeding lips). Once you have completed the process (twice a day for 21 days), use Hydroval Cream 0.2% to assist in the healing process (works great).",Tiny704
