Underwent surgery to have prostate removed as well as lymph nodes and some cancer that was on his bladder.  He started the Eligard injections every 3 to 4 months since.  His PSA levels have remained at a 1.0 until recently.  A friend suggest he take a multi vitamin of Quercetin, zinc, stinging nettle root, Vitamin C and D3.  He has been taking it for 3 weeks and just went back in for another injection.  His PSA was 0 but yet they still gave him the injection.  If his PSA is 0 why would he need another injection.  He continues to suffer from all the same side effects of night sweats, frequent urination, mood swings, depression, and loss of memory.  I want him to stop the shots but wondering if anyone else has quit taking the shots with a PSA of 0.",What to Do?
1,Leuprolide,Prostate Cancer,4.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 30, 2022",0,"Eligard (leuprolide):If you are interested, watch a YT video called, High PSA (prostate specific antigen) is NOT a diagnosis for prostate cancer.  I watched this after having elegard treatments.  The video made me angry but it was eye opening. Was diagnosed with Prostate cancer in 2014. I was treated with radioactive seeds, it worked for just over 1 1/2 years! My PSA started climbing so I was given Lupron injections. The Lupron injections kept my PSA down just over 1 1/2 years. After a period of time without any injections, my PSA started rising again so my DR started me on Lupron injections, the Lupron injections brought my PSA back down again. Then the side effects started, I never thought a person could go through so much misery! The only way I could handle it was giving all what I was going through to Jesus Christ! Loss of muscle mass plus. Now after receiving these Eligard injections my PSA is starting to rise again?? I’ve lost so much muscle mass, I stopped Eligard!",Johnny

With zero testosterone I went to strip club with friends - nothing happened. An hour  of watching porn - no reaction.

I only have 3 left to complete the 2 year treatment.  I had (have) Stage 3 prostate cancer, it spread to the lymph nodes, but no further (they think!).  No surgery since it spread...I had my last (45th) Radiation treatment 6/9/21.  Back to the Eligard.  I was about to stop (after 3) or slow down the injections due to the crappy side effects, but Oncologist talked me into continuing.  I am counting the months until I am done.  My biggest side effect is bad headaches for several weeks after each injection.  Yes, I get the hot flashes, I'm dizzy...sleep sucks, joint pain....and now my knees are very painful.  My PSA did drop from mid 20's to .06 (almost nothing).  That's the good part, I guess.  I'm just hoping I can tolerate it all.  GOOD LUCK!",Patient 007 #2

Got the 6 month injection. No pre advice, oral or otherwise. Been 1 month so far. Side effects minimal, hot flashes, etc. So far so good but it’s still early. I attribute many of the negative effects discussed here by others as merely attributable to their ageing. I'm not having anger problems or lack of sex drive that I can’t pin on simply being an old man. I find many of these reviews based on lack of objectiveness. Let’s see what I say in two more months.

He didn't properly convey my wishes and a VA Urologist ordered it anyway. It's been a complete and utter disaster. I have suffered night sweats, lost muscle mass, increased insomnia, testicular shrinkage, and lost libido.

Then two more 6 month hormone shots of Eligard. I have also had SBRT and brachytherapy.  So while it is difficult to assign the side effects I am experiencing to the Eligard alone, I am affected by nearly all its known side effects.  I have zero libido, 4 or 5 hot flashes per day, major loss of strength and energy, genital shrinkage, body hair loss, weight gain, frequent urination at night, some short term memory loss, mood changes, apathy, and increased frequency of bowel movements.  I have trouble carrying groceries up the stairs where I live now because of my loss of strength.  I have continued to exercise and I take calcium, vitamin D, and multi-vitamin supplements, but I am still getting progressively weaker.  The good news is my PSA is around zero now, and if it doesn’t increase I won’t have to get another Eligard injection when this last one wears off.",Bikefox

I stopped for 2 months and just had a 3 month injection, being told it would not be as invasive, rubbish  as I am now back in the throes of strange side effects, mostly constant diarrhea, bowel incontinence, all 24/7 hot flashes. The same reason I stopped Casodex after 3 months due to severe ""hand and foot syndrome"". I can control the mental aspects, but I think but this was my last injection. Sure, the traditional approach probably saved my life but every body is different in terms of the post radiation treatments.

Had exam and PSA test annually until I was 75 and doc says you have prostate the size of 15 year old and PSA is normal, so you don’t need to come back.  Now 80 and PC metastasized to lymph nodes in neck.  PC is also related to Agent Orange.  Started with 30-days of Casodex and 90-days of Lupron.  PSA went from 75.5 to 0.06.  Lupron side effects not too bad, but seem to be getting worse as I approach next injection in a couple of days.

I haven't got a PSA yet, prior to Eligard, it was 7, then 17, then 24.  Due to Covid...I put off seeing an Oncologist for 7 months.  I got both Moderna vacs in March...I started Radiation in April and finished on June 9. It seems each shot of Eligard is getting a bit worse.  This last one hurt and burned longer.. a minor issue.  Hot Flashes seem more frequent.  I too go to bathroom about 9 or 10 times a nite...every 1 to 1.5 hours, but that was happening before Eligard.  I am dizzy a lot...and I don't have much energy (I used to be quite active).  I am 66 years old.  My cancer rated as Stage 3...there were tumors on 8 of 12 biopsy samples.  Surgery wasn't an option since scans showed it may have spread to lymph nodes.   I will update this (if possible) with my PSA score this September.  Good luck to everyone.

This drug is very effective in slowing the prostate cancer growth. Testosterone is the fuel for PC. My testosterone level went from 840 to 11 in three weeks after my first injection!  However, there surely are side-effects. Mine are: 1. Fatigue and low energy with breathlessness upon exercise. 2. Hot flashes 3. low red blood cell count (anemia). 4. Lack of sexual desire and unable to perform. 5. Shrunken testicles and penis. The side-effects are frustrating...but you can tough them out.

I received a 4 month, (30mg) injection on May 19 and started radiation on June 21.  As of this writing I'm into my 8th week on this drug.So far my side effects have been minimal with very mild hot flashes, (about 2-3 times a day but very subtle), loss of sex drive and some ED at this point.  I get about 6-7hrs decent sleep a night, haven't had to get up to pee in the middle of the night much, no vision, confusion, brain fog issues, ect as others describe but I'm not long term therapy either.  Doc said the 'kick-in' with side effects is typically at the 3 week point so, so far, I'm doing pretty well. Doc says I should regain most, if not all, my ED function when the drug wears off after the 4 month time frame.  A definitive change in my diet and exercise has also helped a great deal with limiting my side effects.  Hope this helps anyone in similar circumstances.",Dufrain

I will take a 3rd one in 5 months time and see if it goes beyond the 4 months for the 30mg to have effect. The date is 8th December 2011 and the 3rd one is due in March 2012.,BarryL
85,Leuprolide,Prostate Cancer,9.0,,"October 18, 2011",95,"Lupron (leuprolide):Got a shot of it on Friday, some soreness on Saturday; but saw immediate results of reduced urgency to void every hour, sometimes 4-5 times per hour, depending on consumption of liquid.  Some sensitivity to right side of groin and scrotum.  Seemed like it might be some blockage in semen tubing or possibly the medication impacting the two lymph nodes that showed some cancer invasion.  Now it is Tuesday evening and the sensitivity on the right side groin is minimal.  It is really amazing how fast the medication impacted the symptoms.  I got a 3 month shot and expect to do a blood draw in 6 weeks to evaluate the impact on the PSA levels.  So far so good.",Mikeymini

87,Leuprolide,Prostate Cancer,6.0,,"January 3, 2010",71,"Eligard (leuprolide):I was given two injections of Elgard before beginning radiation therapy.  Following the48 radiation treatments, I am still being monitored by my oncologist and urologist.  My last PSA was 0.01.  The side effects of hot flashes, lethargy, and muscle weakness are where I am today, although at my age, 79, I can't complain.  The first of the injections was in April of 2008 and the second in August. Radiation  began in early September 2008 and ended at end of October. It was determined that I am not a candidate for Androgel as there is a possibility of developing cancer again.   So, as you read from the preceding paragraph, I'm luckyto have passed my first year without problems.",Anonymous
88,Leuprolide,Prostate Cancer,8.0,,"December 10, 2009",176,"Lupron (leuprolide):I have been receiving Lupron or Eligard every 6 months for ten years to help reduce the growth of prostate cancer. Early research reports indicated that one side effect might be peripheral neuropathy. That started to develop in my feet shortly after I was put on Lupron. Loss of bone mass has also been associated with Lupron. I have begun taking 1200 units of calcium VitaminD each day. My PSA scores have all continued to be below .1. I have no major complaints, and have learned to live with the side effects.",clauscn

The side effects are minor (hot sweats, decreased energy) Injection site(s) were moved after 6 yrs. from buttox to shoulder(s) due to lower back pain. I hope this gives hope to patients about to begin this regimen.",mike190
