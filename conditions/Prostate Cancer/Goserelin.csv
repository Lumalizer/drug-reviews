3,Goserelin,Prostate Cancer,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 1, 2018",6,Zoladex (goserelin):Zoladex hammered down my PSA from 50 at initial diagnosis to 5 after 6 weeks of treatment. Intention is to shrink and damp down tumour activity before prostatectomy.Having Cancer is depressing but this seems effective. How can one tell what symptoms are from the drug and what is from the other conditions one has and from the ideas one has about having cancer?(UK patient covered by free NHS care),Thinker
4,Goserelin,Prostate Cancer,,,"November 9, 2017",5,"Zoladex (goserelin):This is a question for my Pop, he currently has cancer and is using Zoladex injections once a month, his Doctor has told him he needs a break from it for a while. Why would they suggest a break from treatment and also will the cancer spread and make him worse???Please help, Thank you.",jennAlea
5,Goserelin,Prostate Cancer,,,"February 15, 2016",38,Zoladex (goserelin):My partner has been on and off zoladex for nearly 6 years- with PSA first detected at 4000 and soaring between 0 - 600 - 50 but with 12 month breaks in treatment. He takes a regime of ganoderma mushroom extract he believes this has also helped him stay very healthy and free of cancer symptoms. The only side effects and illness he suffers is from zoladex. It probably has contributed to saving his life but it has changed that life forever. He has huge mood swings confusion memory loss fatigue total loss of sexual function- in short it keeps him alive but keeps him alive and completely altered.  If you have low testosterone levels then the side effects are mild. If you have a high  levels it is personality changing.,Witness148
6,Goserelin,Prostate Cancer,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 16, 2014",48,Zoladex (goserelin):I had very aggressive prostate cancer that lead to a radical prostatectomy but they didn't get all the cancer. Seven weeks of radiation and the PSA was down to .04.  It crept up slowly but when it started doubling ever 2-3 months I was put on Zoladex.  Although I have hot flushes and am struggling to maintain fitness and strength the side effects are minor compared to dying of cancer!  My PSA has now dropped back to undetectable.,Dlanor
7,Goserelin,Prostate Cancer,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 1, 2012",38,"Zoladex (goserelin):Seems to have worked well in reducing cancer/PSA.  Minimal side effects EXCEPT for both hands.Both hands are painful when moved and big knuckles can be very hurtful when holding an object. Warmth helps, as does minimising hand movements.Can hold a tennis ball without problems. a golf ball with some effort and pain, and a pen or small object can be a big problem to grasp.",BumbleB
8,Goserelin,Prostate Cancer,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 30, 2012",67,"Zoladex (goserelin):In January 2009 - My Prostate Cancer had metastasised into both ischia (Pelvis). My PSA was 33. I was prescribed Casodex as a forerunner to Zoladex LA (to avoid Tumour Flare. I was then lucky because I managed to rid myself of the Secondary Cancer by June 2009. I had altogether 15 implants of Zoladex LA over the last 3Â¼ years - and after my bone scan still showed ""Image Clear"" - my Urologist allowed me to discontinue any future treatment for the time being - but - keeping a careful watch my PSA (which most recently was down at 0.270) and the Testosterone level - (down at 0.2). I am now in my 5th week since the end of the last of the 12-week cycle and I am due to have a Blood test in 3 days' time. I felt very little side effects any time.",ernst1930
