0,Lupron Depot,Prostate Cancer,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 15, 2022",0,"76 yrs. white male. PSA 200. Cancer spread to back and shoulders ( according to PET scan). Got the 6 month injection. No pre advice, oral or otherwise. Been 1 month so far. Side effects minimal, hot flashes, etc. So far so good but it’s still early. I attribute many of the negative effects discussed here by others as merely attributable to their ageing. I'm not having anger problems or lack of sex drive that I can’t pin on simply being an old man. I find many of these reviews based on lack of objectiveness. Let’s see what I say in two more months. As far as the doctors prognosis, I believe they are helpless against PC and reckless with others lives. They will get old too.",Doberman Den
1,Lupron Depot,Prostate Cancer,,,"August 19, 2021",2,"Have had lymphoma for many years from Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam.  Had exam and PSA test annually until I was 75 and doc says you have prostate the size of 15 year old and PSA is normal, so you don’t need to come back.  Now 80 and PC metastasized to lymph nodes in neck.  PC is also related to Agent Orange.  Started with 30-days of Casodex and 90-days of Lupron.  PSA went from 75.5 to 0.06.  Lupron side effects not too bad, but seem to be getting worse as I approach next injection in a couple of days.  I’m hoping to switch to a mCSPC (castration sensitive) medicine, instead of the Lupron, which is mCRPC (castration resistant).",Dave
2,Lupron Depot,Prostate Cancer,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 11, 2021",6,"I have been on lupron for 6 months (2 of the three month injections). This drug is very effective in slowing the prostate cancer growth. Testosterone is the fuel for PC. My testosterone level went from 840 to 11 in three weeks after my first injection!  However, there surely are side-effects. Mine are: 1. Fatigue and low energy with breathlessness upon exercise. 2. Hot flashes 3. low red blood cell count (anemia). 4. Lack of sexual desire and unable to perform. 5. Shrunken testicles and penis. The side-effects are frustrating...but you can tough them out. God has given me strength, and without my faith...this would be much tougher. My wife has been an angel with her constant support. Goodluck!",duckman
3,Lupron Depot,Prostate Cancer,8.0,,"July 10, 2021",5,"I'm 57 and diagnosed in Apr with tumor confined in one lobe only, a Gleason of 7 (3+4), and a PSA of 9.22.  I received a 4 month, (30mg) injection on May 19 and started radiation on June 21.  As of this writing I'm into my 8th week on this drug.So far my side effects have been minimal with very mild hot flashes, (about 2-3 times a day but very subtle), loss of sex drive and some ED at this point.  I get about 6-7hrs decent sleep a night, haven't had to get up to pee in the middle of the night much, no vision, confusion, brain fog issues, ect as others describe but I'm not long term therapy either.  Doc said the 'kick-in' with side effects is typically at the 3 week point so, so far, I'm doing pretty well. Doc says I should regain most, if not all, my ED function when the drug wears off after the 4 month time frame.  A definitive change in my diet and exercise has also helped a great deal with limiting my side effects.  Hope this helps anyone in similar circumstances.",Dufrain
4,Lupron Depot,Prostate Cancer,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 27, 2021",10,"Had a prostatectomy in Oct. 2019 and PSA rose in April 2020. Took bicaltumide pills and a lupron injection in Aug 2020. second injection in Jan 2021. The next injection is May 2021.  My side effects are mostly really bad hot flashes day and night, extra fat around waist, got the mood thing going. My wife said I should talk to doc before next dose. I also got an inguinal hernia after surgery . It is a hard drug to live with but at 71 years old I'll take every day. I see the doc next month for a checkup after a blood test. I also had 39 radiation visits in Jan 2021.  I hope my PSS is still around 0.034 due to lupron. I have to take a total of 5 injections which have been every 4 months.    Good luck to people who have to take this route.",surferman
5,Lupron Depot,Prostate Cancer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 6, 2021",28,"I completely agree with Rob, if i had have known the consequences of taking this drug, I would probably done the same as him. It takes away everything that being a man is.He does not however mention the sex word, from my first injection 5 years ago there has not been any, plenty of everything else that he states but no kind of love making. Probably he did not take enough to cause e/d, if not good on him.Not enough information is given to us about the FULL effects of this drug, men are not made to live a good QOL without testosterone, because after you have been castrated that is it. As far as I can tell very few men have good sex and real happiness after having the drug.",geezer46

7,Lupron Depot,Prostate Cancer,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 9, 2020",24,"I’m a 66 yo male who was diagnosed with moderately aggressive prostate cancer with Gleason score of 8 and PSA of 7.2.

8,Lupron Depot,Prostate Cancer,8.0,,"January 10, 2020",24,"69 years old. Had seed implants 16 years ago . PSA slowly creeped up and due to an incompetent doctor, it spread to my spine before getting any treatment...Thankfully , I made a visit to another MD and got 1st class care.I just had my 2nd Lupron injection (3 month interval). No side effects other than mild hot flashes. I keep a strenuous exercise program in place and I thinks that helps a great deal . On Zuniga  also. PSA  down to .50 from high of 17",bluechip56

10,Lupron Depot,Prostate Cancer,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 27, 2019",35,"I was given this poison, for the first time , May 2nd, 2019. The Doctors/nurses would NOT tell me the name of it. Only referred to it as: Hormone Therapy. 60 seconds AFTER the nurse shoved a 22.5mg 3-month dose of it, into my butt....the 'Doctor's assistant, walked up to me , handed me a booklet: 'Understanding Lupron Therapy"", said: You better TAKE THIS HOME AND READ IT"", she 'laughed, turned around and said: ""see  ya"". When I got home, I turned to the 1st page. It said: ""side-effects': ""heart attacks,  strokes, bone damage, diabetes, AND, ""SUDDEN  DEATH......"" I was so angry. She injected me with  a POISON. For 10 weeks, I was l was so angry, mad it was indescribable bad.  The ""worst 3 months of my life"" !",K. Stanyo

12,Lupron Depot,Prostate Cancer,,,"February 8, 2019",31,"My father has prostate cancer and he was given the Lupron shot. Everything was going fine for my dad until 2 weeks after the shot. He started having side effects from the shot. Now before I go any further let me just say if anyone has PTSD do not take this drug. My father started seeing things that were not there, hearing things that no else could hear, and smelling things that no one else could smell. Now not everyone will have the same side effects, but if you have PTSD it will kick it into gear.This might be the right treatment for you, it is not for my dad. Again if you struggle with PTSD this may not be the treatment for you. I hope this was helpful in some way. ",sevenstarr
13,Lupron Depot,Prostate Cancer,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 25, 2018",46,"I had prostrate cancer 10 yrs ago so they say. 43 treatments of radiation and the PSA is gone. Now 67 years old and my PSA went up to 8.5 10 years later and my doctor wants to do the lupron shot. First one 2 years a big one 45 mg. It almost killed me - I had never been so sick. Now 2 and half years later my PSA was 13 so I told the doc I would try a smaller dose so I did 7.5 a year ago and another 7.5 last week my PSA is 3.2 but still said I should take it. Let me tell you men I WILL NEVER TAKE ANOTHER LUPRON SHOT AS LONG AS I LIVE.   The side effects you read about are true, blood pressure problems diabetes. I'm never having  lupron shot ever again.",lupron hater
14,Lupron Depot,Prostate Cancer,8.0,,"August 18, 2018",56,"My husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer stage 4 in 2014. His prostate was removed and later started on Lupron depot every 3 months. His PSA went down to almost nil. Over the next four years he has been on Lupron according to his PSA levels. Though Lupron does keep his PSA levels down, his mood swings/anger and his irrational thinking has stressed our relationship.  He is mean with comments to me and his actions. He needs Lupron to live but it has killed our relationship. The Oncologist who gave him his first Lupron injection, did tell us, that one of the side effects of Lupron was that it could increase moods and anger. I am stressing to you, wives, that Lupron is one ugly drug. It makes people who are receiving Lupron depots very miserable people and their partners/spouses very stressed out, scared at times, lonely and sad for what is happening in their relationship. Lupron gives the patient, quantity of life but not quality of life!",stressed out wife
15,Lupron Depot,Prostate Cancer,1.0,,"May 25, 2016",39,"My dad had 1 shot of Lupron at age of 80 for elevated prostate cancer. He lost control of his muscles, was unable to walk and accelerated his dementia. My dad passed away 10 months after the shot.",Anonymous
16,Lupron Depot,Prostate Cancer,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 22, 2015",69,"I am experiencing the following side-effects: Breast enlargement, reduction of size of testicles, complete ED, multiple hot flashes hourly, and a mental fog that prevents clear thinking.  These were all expected side effects and came as no surprise.  Additional unexpected side effects include: rapid pulse rate, elevated BP, breathlessness, short term memory loss, extreme and uncontrollable emotional outbursts (uncontrollable crying over minimally emotional issues), and sleep deprivation (1-2 hours total sleep which could account for the emotional issues).  Of additional concern are anecdotal statements by others claiming no reduction of any side effects even after years of removal from follow-up injections of Lupron. My concern is great enough to request suspension of this drug, even at the cost of an elevated PSA with a corresponding resurgence of the cancer.  I know there are additional drugs I can take to counteract some of these side-effects, but I would rather not complicate the situation with even more medication. My PSA stands at .3 as of this writing, and I would withdraw my request were it to increase to 4.0, however continued living with this nightmare drug is not my idea of life.",65 year old Marvin with PC
17,Lupron Depot,Prostate Cancer,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 7, 2014",67,"Had my first injection of Lupron 7.5 mg in July; second injection at the same dosage is set for August 21. So far no hot flashes or side effects. Have been taking Casodex simultaneously (30-day supply) which will end shortly. Only side effect from that initially was fatigue, which resolved after 5 days. Decided to insist on 1-month Lupron injections instead of a 3-6 month extended dose as PC support group participants on the once-a-month dose had far fewer side effects. I'm sticking to my guns on this one; MD tried to give me a 6-month dose right off the bat. I'm switching MDs and glad I did it this way. Hope this helps others.",WWII Vet

The side effects are minor (hot sweats, decreased energy) Injection site(s) were moved after 6 yrs. from buttox to shoulder(s) due to lower back pain.
