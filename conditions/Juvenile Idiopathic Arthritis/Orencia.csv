1,Orencia,Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,7,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 23, 2014",18,"My daughter started monthly Orencia infusions for her Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis about 3 years after being diagnosed. She had been previously taking Enbrel and Methotrexate injections weekly for 3 years. Her arthritis became more aggressive so her Rheumatologist started her on Orencia. (Continuing the Methotrexate injections). She got used to the infusion part rather quickly. She had no side effects at all, and the only problem we had was the occasional blown vein. Unfortunately, the medication did not prove to be effective for her. After 8 months of constant flare ups, oral steroids and steroid injections, we decided to change the medications again. There are however 2 other children we know that the Orencia is helping prevent flare ups.",Anonymous
