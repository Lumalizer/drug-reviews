0,Methotrexate,Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,1,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 24, 2020",6,I was officially diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) at 14 and they put me on methotrexate. I experienced more pain on it than not and the reaction it had with my nervous system had my stomach churning and and me sitting in the bathroom in case I got physically sick from it (which ended up happening a few times).,Dames
1,Methotrexate,Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,8,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 10, 2020",15,"I am a 24 year old female. Diagnosed with JIA (juvenile Idiopathic arthritis) when I was 2. I've been taking Methotrexate  since I was 10 years old. Worked like a charm with basically no side effects and only an occasional arthritis or uveitis flare up (maybe once every 3-4 years).Started having side effects approximately 2 years ago. I get stomach and headache the day I take my dose (20 mg - been on that dose for the last 6 years) or the next day, it basically makes me unable to do anything and I have to lie down and just let it all pass. Doc said they'll put me on Humira this year because my uveitis in left eye has been active 2 years already and corticosteroid eye drops seems to be ineffective. I think Methotrexate really did help me a lot and I would recommend taking it.",Marzanna
