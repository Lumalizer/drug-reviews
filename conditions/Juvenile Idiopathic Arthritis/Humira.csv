0,Humira,Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 3, 2018",5,"My daughter who is 11 was on humira for a year. She has now developed psoriasis and her nails have crumbled and fallen off. More worryingly though her legs are twitching all the time, her joints are all swollen and she is struggling to walk and is in severe pain. I am terrified that she has neurological damage caused by the humira and muscle weakness.  She is waiting for joint injections.  I spoke to rheumatologists who dismissed it and said wasn't due to humira.  Could someone please advise me if they gave nerve damage due to humira? My poor daughter has been off school for months and has no social life now.",Mana
1,Humira,Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,10,,"September 19, 2015",6,The drug itself has been awesome. My 14 year old daughter no longer has any of the pain or stiffness. Like the other reviewer our problem is with the injector. It is easy enough to use but she dreads it every time. She wants to switch to the syringe. Outside of that the medication does what its supposed to.,Brisdad
2,Humira,Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,9,,"May 30, 2008",20,"My 9 year old daughter is being treated for Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis. She has been taking the HUMIRA injection for 2 months now. She has shown a major improvement; she used to spike a very high temp. (103-106) now it's in the normal rage, but the only thing is that the injection is very painful to her. It is a wonder drug.",tjj5765
