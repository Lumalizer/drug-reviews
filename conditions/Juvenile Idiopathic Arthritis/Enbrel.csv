0,Enbrel,Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,7,,"October 31, 2019",4,"Was diagnosed with Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis at the age of 16. In 8 months it spread to most of my joints. Doc confirmed diagnoses with MRI of SI joints showing years worth of damage and immediately prescribed Enbrel. For about 3 months it worked perfectly and I was able to exercise again until it started to wear off before the next injection and eventually stopped working altogether. The injections themselves had also become quite painful when it lost effectiveness but with no redness or rash of any kind at injection site, just a painful sting and a short ache. Blood test revealed I had developed antibodies to the Enbrel, making it useless as a treatment. The Enbrel was worth it during the time it did work, some moderate side effects but nothing intolerable like head or stomach ache. Bummer that my body had to reject the medication like that. Getting switched to a combo of Humira and low dosage Methotrexate soon.",Jasper
1,Enbrel,Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 27, 2019",6,"I can honestly say that this medication has improved my life better than anything else.I've been taken it for about 2 years.I  take the shot once a week and even if sometimes it can be a little painful, I can bear than for 10 seconds or less. I can do every sport I like. Also, I am on methotrexate which is not such a pleasant medicine. At some point I took 20 mg per week that made me vomit. After that I've taken 10 mg per week and it s a little better, but I still get nausea. Enbrel was a game changer for me, but I have to see how's methotrexate really working because I saw such horrible reviews that I got a little scared of what might happen to my body.",Mishel
2,Enbrel,Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 29, 2017",3,My 14 yr old daughter takes this once a week. It has really helped her. But the injections hurt and she often cries for several minutes after getting the shots. She has multiple health issues and has had 3 open heart surgeries. We have elected to stop taking shots and try something else. Its just too hard on her.,Asia742
3,Enbrel,Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 11, 2016",8,"My experience so far with embrel has been just brilliant! This is comming from someone who at one point had to get lifted out the bath, have someone wash my hair, get me dressed, put my shoes on. I currently taking the 50mg pre filled pen, just about to take my third dose today. The effects so far have been excellent and I have seen a huge improvement in the quality of my life! After 2 weeks of taking embrel I have no stiffness on a morning, I can go a full day without taking ANY pain killers (prior to this I had to take 2, 30mg codeine 4 times a day, followed by 2 500mg naproxen twice a day - just to function!!!) I have seen a big improvement in my hips (stiffness/pain) and the swelling in both of my knees has almost gone!!",Anonymous
4,Enbrel,Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,7,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 23, 2014",10,"My daughter started weekly Enbrel injections, in combination with Methotrexate injections, about 6 months after she was diagnosed with Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. She continued them for about 3 years. During that time she barely had any side effects from the medication. Pain and redness at the injection site and occasional nausea after the injections for about 24 hours. It did seem to control her flare ups for most of the time. After about 2 1/2 years her arthritis became more aggressive and the medication was not as effective. Her doctor decided to change her medications. But over all, Enbrel was an effective medication for the first years of her arthritis.",Anonymous
