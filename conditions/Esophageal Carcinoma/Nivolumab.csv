0,Nivolumab,Esophageal Carcinoma,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2022",1,"I have Hashimotos Thyroiditis. My body didn’t tolerate the treatment. I had one infusion about 8 weeks ago. The side effects have came in stages. First was the fatigues I wasn’t at a dr appointment, I was trying to rest up.I also had liver pain. My enzymes tripled.The next phase was numbness in my midsection. Every muscle in my abdomen felt as if it were constantly being flexed. This lasted about 6 weeks.The side effects have lessened some what but I have now developed neuropathy. The nerve that seems to be affected is the funny bone nerve in both arms.When laying down it gets worse. While I try to sleep, the nerve gets activated. This is the same feeling as when you hit your funny bone only it lasts a lot longer. The pain is a 10 out of 10.As I already have an autoimmunity, I wondered if this kind of thing might happen. I know people who are having fantastic results from similar treatments. This just wasn’t the right treatment for me.",WWD
