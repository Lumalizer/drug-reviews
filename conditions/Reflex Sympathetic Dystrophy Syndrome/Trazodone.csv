0,Trazodone,Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome,5,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 15, 2017",6,"I take 50 milligrams of Trazodone and experience hypotension. I am also taking Buspar. Clonazepam, Pepcid, Celexa, and today was prescribed Prednisone. Come to find out, some of these drugs can have bad side effects, especially Trazodone. I may have to change to another sleep aid, but really like the Trazodone. Pepcid is not a drug with good side effects. I think it is what is causing my hypotension. I also have been unsteady on my feet and confusion. go figure, we don't know what we are taking that could make us sicker than what we are, or dead.",Frannie5252

2,Trazodone,Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome,8,,"January 5, 2015",21,"I took trazodone for over a year with no problems. Best sleep aid I ever had.  All of the sudden it started giving me priapism.  Ended up in the hospital for 16 hours and it wasn't pleasant (300 mg).  I scaled back all of the way to 25 mg and ended up in the hospital for 5 hours.  Now that I'm off of it, my sleeping is terrible.  I have a hard time waking up.I miss trazodone.  I can't find anything else like it.",Bwcoolk

4,Trazodone,Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome,10,,"March 11, 2010",57,"I have Fibromyalgia and also RSD in my shoulder, which came after severe trauma to my left side and hip which was fractured also. RSD is a frustrating disorder. But Trazadone has really helped my sleep and makes me feel rested and I sleep for 8 hours or so usually.I take sometimes up to 10mg of Lorazepam depending on which doctor prescribes it and I take this everyday for severe anxiety and panic attacks and it helps with the pain I have all over my body too.But Lorazepam can't put me to sleep in the hospital they gave me 14mg everyday of my 30 day stay and it just made me hyper.So I believe benzodiazepines and things like Ambien, Lunesta, and Imovane are not necessary. Trazadone helps you sleep much better and is not addictive.",Tom1984age25
5,Trazodone,Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome,10,,"December 5, 2009",76,"I have been on all types of medicine for my condition. Trazodone is the miracle pill for me, I sleep well, a solid eight hours my mood has improved the clarity of my thought process has benefited totally. I have no negative side effects from this medicine. I am also going through menopause with no symptoms of any ugly effects from menopause. I believe that trazodone has helped in all areas. I would never come off this medicine. It has been a blessing, I have been on it for three years. The quality of my life is wonderful. Thanks to those angels who came up with this medicine.",zanthi
