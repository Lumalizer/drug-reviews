0,Amitriptyline,Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome,10,,"July 28, 2019",4,"I am a Stage lll, type ll, total body CRPS patient -- currently experiencing ND/Paralysis (post active).I have used Amitriptyline and have had great response to it. My nerves stopped creating Post Frozen Appendage Thawing phenomenon. I was taking 10mg initially and after 6 months my doctor added 2.5mg to the 10mg and it worked for 1 yr. My very responsible pain doctor took me off rather than continued increases for safety.I now take Hydroxyzine.",Anonymous
1,Amitriptyline,Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome,1,,"September 14, 2017",2,I was diagnosed with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome about 3 years ago. From my elbow to the tip of my fingers the pain is always there. I am on 25mg once a day and the pain is still there. Sometimes so severe I have to cry out. These pills do very little for me.,stumpjumper 206
2,Amitriptyline,Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 28, 2017",4,"Started at 10 mg up to 25mg. Doesn't help pain but I do sleep better. Extremely dry mouth and skin since I began 2 months ago. Not sure if the sleep is worth the sore dry mouth and skin that when I rub  it, snows dead skin cells everywhere.",Ikimmi
3,Amitriptyline,Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 25, 2015",14,"I have dealt with chronic pain for 30 years. History of left hip fracture, left femur complete break, right foot 180 degree. Multiple fractures were rebuilt with steel rod in femur, pins in left Hip and construction metal in my right foot. In 2010, I fractured my left foot slippig on stairs The foot healed. I had tore my meniscus, again, and had a second surgery. Fractured ribs, lumbar stenosis, hearniated L4-5. Degenerative Spondylosis, central canal stenosis, Bilateral neuroformal stenosis, left paracentral disk herniation @ L5-S1, facet arthhropathy pain is bad, but the pain of CRPS is next level. Amitriptyline 10-20mg at night allows me to sleep without waking in pain. Amitryptiline reduces neuropathic pain and with ER/IR opioids, CRPS",Strainmaker
4,Amitriptyline,Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 1, 2013",17,Since taking this medication I am not reaching for the narcotic pain meds as much as I used to but am more constipated and tired. It's worth the trade off of some of the higher pain medicines for my condition.,Thumper1127
