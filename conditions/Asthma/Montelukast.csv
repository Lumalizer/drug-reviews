My son was on Singulair from the age of 5 until 19. While it did help his asthma, the side affects are not worth it. As a child, he could never sleep, had tremors, sweat like crazy, had anxiety & depression. Watch you child when they get to high school because something can change at that age & it seems the depression get worse suicidal thoughts began. My son stopped his meds on his own. Felt a lot better. Started having asthma issues so started is again at college for a couple weeks. He is old enough now to be able to identify his feelings. He told me he stopped taking it & will never take it again because it made him suicidal",Okie I'm

I was worried about the mental side effects described here as I have a history of anxiety, depression and panic attacks. Honestly my mood has greatly improved on Singulair, probably since I can breathe better now and there's less inflammation in my body. On rainy days I still get congestion and need to clear my throat often but no breathing troubles. I get Singulair on Picnic which has been great; don't need to call or see the doc for refills.",Shan

Been relying on my rescue inhaler too often lately so I figured I'd try this or theophylline again and I started noticing some relief within an hour. It's just day 1, and I will update as time goes on, but I'd say I've seen a 50% improvement in easiness of breathing which is a wonderful feeling. Also my insurance sucks and doesn't cover scripts until my 2.5k deductible is met so bye bye Breo unfortunately.

I'm very sensitive to most meds. The hope is the benefits outweigh the side effects. Well, they did not for me. Barely lasted three days on this. Heavy nausea and tiredness in the first 24 hours. Yes, that did subside a little, but there were other concerning issues. Nightmares, increasing anxiety, deep negative feeling, increasing stomach issues, increasing in asthmatic pressure in the mornings. Pretty sure it made the nose runny, too, because of course it did. Just did not help at all. I just stopped it, and pinged the doctor, who agreed. The side effects subsided after about a day.",npjh1987

Couldn't breath anymore normal, walking steps was almost impossible. I was thinking it goes away.  After 2 weeks it was so bad that I went to a doctor. She said OMGoodness how can you breath. Your lungs are full of mucus. She gave me an injection so I can breath normally again. Also gave me Seretide and Montelukast. I recover after I was moving to a new house without mold.

I was able to sleep better, BUT I developed headaches, skin rashes all over my legs and my belly, and had rapid weight-gain (2 pounds a day!).

Paired with a daily dose of Zyrtec, I don’t find it helps my chronic post nasal drip as much as I expected it to (it does some), but it definitely cleared up the mild wheezing I’d suffer from every night.

Thankfully, I have a support system that I alerted of this possible side effect, and they were there for me. I went to my doctor and she advised to stop taking it (as I uncontrollably cried in the office) and I felt better within a week of being off it.

I thought I would check up the new tablet she was given to check the side affects, to say I was horrified was an understatement (I wish I looked at it sooner ) there they were all of the above I rang the doctor he took her off straight away.

If I move around and stretch it goes away some. I also got very sick, headache, fever and chills, muscle aches. These symptoms were not covid or the flu. These symptoms are some of the low percentage side effects I experienced.  I lowered my dose to 5mg and have been on that dose for 10 days. This lower dose doesn’t have the same muscle ache pain, but I’m coughing much more throughout the day and need to take my rescue inhaler. I also have had coughing attacks on this lower dose. I’m considering going back to 10mg and will try to stretch and drink more fluids everyday to combat the side effects.

However, I also had a significant problem with depression.  My doctor told me to stop taking it when she read about the correlation with depression.  After a few weeks I felt so much better mood-wise, but my allergy and asthma symptoms are that much worse.  I was already taking Zyrtec (it has now been raised to a double dose), Flonase, Azelastin (a recent addition), Sudafed as needed, and Chlorpheniramine as needed.  Doubling the Zyrtec was supposed to eliminate the need for the last two, but the taste of Azelastin is so unpleasant that the urge to just go back to Sudafed is very strong.  I'm resisting because of age and HBP.  The sinus clog/drip is ever-present.

It got worse, not better.  One night, I was convinced someone was in my home. Every light in the house was on. I still kept seeing someone!Coming from a military background, and secure in owning firearms, I was searching my home with a gun. I was looking for an intruder who was NOT there! That was my final straw. I threw my Singulair in the garbage. I’m still agitated and frustrated. I am going to try over the counter medication deemed safe. I’m not sure how long the agitation and tiredness will last.  I pray this will help someone.  Please be careful on this medicine. For me, it’s not worth it.

Singulair/Montelukast was prescribed to me for no reason other than one day my pulmonologist said, ‘it couldn’t hurt’. Boy was he wrong! By the time I realized it was likely causing a bad side effect, I was popping Ativan like candy. I had an overwhelming sense of dread! Like fear, sadness, anxiety and terror all rolled up into one. I write this review because I want everyone to realize the possibility.

I have aspergers and several anxiety disorders, and singulair rapidly exacerbated my issues. Day one was fine, but by days two and three I had weakness in my arms, was unable to focus, and became even more irritated by my triggers than I usually do. When I could sleep, I had unsettling dreams, woke up with a rapid pulse, and, lo and behold, asthmatic chest tightness. I refuse to wait it out to see if it gets better because I cannot let myself spiral back down into depression suicidal thoughts, especially when there are other treatments for asthma available. The doctor who prescribed this didn't mention any side effects, so I did all the research on my own as I normally do. I can't imagine all the people who go through this seemingly unwarranted because doctors wont inform them of side effects.

Best advice is first get on an anxiety medication so that you can deal with the daily thoughts. I'm not saying stay on it forever just while you wait out those weeks. Other key thing is have somone you can call 24/7 and talk to about the thoughts that know how you are regularly. Luckly I still have my mother.,Keeping the faith

I requested my doctor give me an adolescents strength dosage - which he did.  That worked much better.  It still is a very strong and it knocked me out, but I didn't have to worry about calling 911 or not waking up from it.  Asthma is tough to treat.

On Singulair I once couldn't fall asleep until about 12:00 in the afternoon after going to bed at 11:00 pm the night before, and I would often wake up multiple times while sleeping. My anxiety was much higher, I was significantly more depressed, and my previously very well stabilized mood was once again destabilized. I also had some water retention weight gain.
