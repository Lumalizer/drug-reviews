0,Decadron,Asthma,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 4, 2021",3,"Went to the ER for chest pressure and shortness of breath. Got an injection of decadron and never again will I! Right after injection I instantly had a severe panic attack, its been 2 days since I got the injection & I've only slept 7 hours within 48 hours,  it has caused me severe insomnia and my heart rate goes sky high. Chest pressure still hasn't subsided, which may be due to high anxiety from this medicine.",Jamie
1,Decadron,Asthma,4,,"October 4, 2019",27,"I was given this med for asthma from a virus that my inhaled steroids weren’t helping with. I was given a one time dose of 10mg and though it worked for my breathing, the rest of my body is a mess. I have had severe elevated heart rate, high blood pressure, headache,  rigor shakes, muscle spasms in the arms and legs,  faintness, cold sweats, increased urination, severe exhaustion, muscle weakness, heart burn, increased anxiety,  cloudy headedness, nausea, and an intolerance for anything physical beyond just walking.  I am a fit 42 year old woman with no other health issues and this has been blowing my mind that I could get this sick. I did go to the ED and I was told that it can cause these symptoms. The worst part is that because it’s long acting it can take a week from your last dose for it to be cleared out.  So I was told to rest and drink fluids until time passes.   The  good news is, I can breath. The bad news is, it has been a nightmare for the rest of my body.",Mother of 3
