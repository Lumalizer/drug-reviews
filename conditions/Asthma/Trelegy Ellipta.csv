0,Trelegy Ellipta,Asthma,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2022",0,Sadly I don't know if Trelegy would have worked for my asthma.  Tried it once to inhale it - the taste of the powder was so awful I could not even breathe it in fully.   Back to Advair for me.,Disappointed
1,Trelegy Ellipta,Asthma,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 6, 2022",2,"I’ve been on Trelegy for almost 2 years now and it’s my favorite inhaler I’ve been on. If I don’t take it for a day or two, I definitely notice a difference and have to take my rescue inhaler. However, I haven't wheezed once since taking it. I’m slowly getting over a cold and have noticed it’s not hitting the spot as well but I also think it played a big role in me barely having to use my rescue inhaler while I was sick, which I usually have to do.It’s an interesting drug to me since it was originally not even created for asthmatics.My only two side effects have been hoarseness in my voice but only if I don’t rinse my mouth out properly after taking it and I also get easier bruising. The bruising worried me at first but all my blood results have come back normal so I’ve just accepted it as a side effect.",mags
2,Trelegy Ellipta,Asthma,10.0,,"December 9, 2021",3,I started using Trelegy three days ago and have not used my rescue inhaler since. I typically use it three or four times a day and have chest tightness most of the time. I am breathing normally for the first time in my life. If I was not worried about future side effects. I have been on so many medications for asthma and nothing has come close to the results I have had in the past three days. Just praying the results last and that I do not develop other side effects.,Jennifer
3,Trelegy Ellipta,Asthma,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 30, 2021",1,"I was prescribed 1 treatment a day. After the third treatment I became very hoarse. I felt like my head was stopped up like never before. My throat felt closed up, my lungs as well. Trouble breathing.  Rash on my side. Constipation. It’s now 4 days after the last treatment and I’m still having trouble with my throat and voice. This drug was given to me from the doctors office. Sample.",Flying Lady
4,Trelegy Ellipta,Asthma,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 3, 2021",2,"Dr prescribed trelegy in July and I followed with rinsing my mouth out with water. September 29 I went to dentist and  both me and my dentist were shocked. I had the worst dental exam of my life. In May I had no cavities. In September I had to get 5 crowns, 2 teeth could not save and 4 other teeth needed fillings. Since then I not only rinse with water, brush my teeth ,and use mouthwash after my daily inhalation of Trelegy. Today my asthma doctor told me to stop using trelegy. I hope that I never have another dental exam like that again. The dentist believes it was probably the cause and my doctor doesn’t believe it is the cause. My breathing has improved.",Sentinal
5,Trelegy Ellipta,Asthma,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 19, 2021",4,"I have bronchiectasis and I finally see improvement after YEARS of coughing ! Multiple sinus surgeries and antibiotics have given only temporary relief. UNFORTUNATELY, Trelegy is busy making commercials, but they make it impossible to get it covered by my insurance...",coughing for 5
6,Trelegy Ellipta,Asthma,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 11, 2021",3,"I have severe eosinophilic asthma. I was given a 1 mo sample of Trelegy Elipta 200.  My asthma is greatly improved, it has cut down on both mucus production and need for ventolin.  I’ve had a daily headache since starting the medication.  Heart feels like it’s racing on and off, blood pressure is elevated.",Jmk77
7,Trelegy Ellipta,Asthma,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 3, 2021",5,"Trelegy has not reduced the need for a rescue inhaler. The side effects of constipation, joint pain, cough and sore throat were not worth being on a corticosteroid.",Debkle
8,Trelegy Ellipta,Asthma,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 26, 2021",17,"I am having a terrible experience with this medication. I have been taking Trelegy 100 for two weeks now and I just realized today this medication is what is causing my issues - heart pounding, irregular heartbeat, pain in my arms /hands and legs/feet - almost feels like nerve pain, it's hard to describe. My body is making involuntary movements, almost like twitching. I've been feeling so tired, pretty sure I've gained weight too. This medication is terrible and is not for me. I'd warn everyone to be careful...I've never had a reaction to medication this way before.",Cori
9,Trelegy Ellipta,Asthma,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 10, 2021",6,"After 2 weeks on Trelegy, an $800 air purifier and 3 humidifiers, one on each floor of the house, am feeling great! Have had asthma most of my life.  No side effects yet! Have tried different inhalers that were not nearly as effective.",Breathing free
10,Trelegy Ellipta,Asthma,2.0,,"January 8, 2021",10,"Got 6 weeks sample of Trelegy, I have been using just a rescue inhaler. Occasionally they would not be effective and I would need to go to hospital. Steroids generally just cleared it up. Other than that decent functionality for an asthmatic.At first it seemed like nights weren't as bad, they had been the worst before. This still seems to basically be true; however, now my nose get completely stopped up at night, an inconvenience, but not the end of the world. The real issue is all of the phlegm, and the constantly being out of breath. Before I was able to work all day and maybe need a puff or two from the rescue. Now I can't even walk 100 yards and I am literally producing cups of phlegm a day and coughing a lot. At this point I think I am going to discontinue use, I started slowly putting off when I take it, and it seems like I am doing better before I take the medication. Then within 30 min I'm having breathing issues.",Mac C
11,Trelegy Ellipta,Asthma,9.0,,"December 13, 2020",26,"Lifelong asthmatic here. Been using albuterol inhalers since I can remember multiple times per day. Advair for 20+ years. Tried injections and too many other meds to list.Just this week my doctor gave me sample of Trelegy...it's like magic so far, made my Ventolin disappear since I have not reached for it in 5 days.Have not had side effects, hope this continues....",HuffPuff
12,Trelegy Ellipta,Asthma,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 5, 2020",19,5 years with no dental cavities. After using Trelegy according to instructions for just over SIX MONTHS I have just been diagnosed with EIGHT cavities costing ~$2000 to repair! After breathing the powder I always rinse THREE times. My dentist has recommended BRUSHING after use as well now that we see these side effects! I'm also finding the drug less effective after six months and now need to use Rescue Inhaler at least once per day which I did not need at all after starting on Trelegy.,Tempedan
