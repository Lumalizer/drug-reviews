0,Methylprednisolone,Asthma,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 20, 2021",2,"I was prescribed a medrol dose pack for a sinus infection after taking it for 5 days I felt worse, my whole body hurt, I couldn't walk very well and I couldn't be touched without having pain. I told my Dr about it and was advised the steroid wouldn't cause this, I did quit taking it and it took 3 weeks for me to recovery. Believing my Dr I was once again prescribed the dose pack a few months later, after taking it for 3 days I once again found my lower back and legs in extreme pain, of course I quit taking it immediately and seen a Dr at an immediate care center.  They advised me this can happen and wrote it down as an allergy, needless to say I won't be taking this again, the pain has resolved for the most part, only hurting if I use my legs for too long and I still have weakness in my legs when walking. It's only been 3 days since I have quit taking it. I am so glad I listened to my gut this time around. I think it is wonderful that it helps so man y people but medrol is definitely not for me.",notforme

2,Methylprednisolone,Asthma,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 2, 2020",3,Medrol Dosepak (methylprednisolone):This Medrol Dosepak always does the trick in helping with my allergy induced asthma. The downside is I take Diltiazem a heart med to regulate my heart rate and the steroid makes my heart race.,jmwhitti
3,Methylprednisolone,Asthma,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 18, 2020",11,"MethylPREDNISolone Dose Pack (methylprednisolone):If you have any breathing issues, this could save your life I promise! Miracle drug and not a narcotic so idk why they don't prescribe it when its desperately needed.

5,Methylprednisolone,Asthma,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 25, 2019",10,"I've been taking the methylprednisolone dose pack 4mg for three days now. I feel like it's already ruined my life. I had no prior history of anxiety or panic attacks, but I've woken up every day feeling like I'm going to die of a heart attack since I've taken it. I now have unbearable anxiety, panic and terrifying shortness of breath that is only relieved for brief periods of time by Xanax. I am literally in tears over this as a grown man. I'm afraid to go to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this drug to my worst enemy. Avoid it at all costs.",Kev

8,Methylprednisolone,Asthma,6.0,,"January 23, 2010",9,"Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone):My asthma attack and fever of 102.6 started suddenly 1/18/2010. I went to my pulmonary doctor 1/19. I received a Solu-Medrol dosepak. The first days dose is the heaviest. I took it as directed. I had taken 2 doses on the second day when I developed severe chest pains. I returned to my doctor and was admitted to hospital for cardiac work-up. Within 24 hours of tests, I was discharged. I never had any more chest pain after stopping medicine. I must have developed a sensitivity last May when I had pneumonia for 16 days in hospital. My body is very sensitive to medicines. I liked Solu-Medrol. Maybe I have to take it with Benadryl.  I don't know until I speak with my doctor on my return visit.",Babs53
