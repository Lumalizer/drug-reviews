0,Xopenex HFA,Asthma,,,"January 14, 2018",17,I have used Proventil and Pro Air the past few years. I have Panic Disorder and don’t like the side effects of albuterol but have to use a rescue inhaler at times. My new Formulary for 2018 discontinued those two and Levalbuterol was available. Research said it had less side effects and maybe stronger. I’m grateful to have it and I’m no longer hesitant to use my rescue inhaler because it has no anxious side effects and works. I highly recommend it and would never switch. Great for nervous and anxious patients.,Darkhorse007
