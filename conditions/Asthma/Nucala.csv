0,Nucala,Asthma,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 6, 2022",0,"I wanted to thank everyone for taking the time to write their experiences. In particular one person wrote about the different asthma medication with same affects. My asthma has been under control while on xolair, Dupixent, forget fasenra, and now Nucala.  I’ve had muscle and joint pain with all of them, but this is my third month on Nucala and the muscle and joint pains are worse.  I’m having a real hard time with my thumbs, severe pain even when I’m not using my hands. I’ve developed a Bone spur on my left thumb that is extremely painful to the touch.  I’m not sure if I now have arthritis.  I’m so confused what to do next.  I guess I’ll stay on Nucala until it’s obvious beyond any doubt that it is the cause of it all, and I’m unable to manage the pain.  Back, neck, spine, hands, muscle spasm on my calves, etc.  I forgot to mention my Eosinophils were so high I was hospitalized, another reason why I was switched over to Nucala.   I hope some will benefit!",Maritza

2,Nucala,Asthma,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 18, 2021",0,"I have adult eosinophilic asthma. Never had asthma as a kid. After receiving my first injection of Nucala 2 weeks later I had an anaphylactic shock, but I was told it wasn't the nucala. Had injection #2, and 1 week later and again little over two weeks had 2 anaphylactic shock,  but according to the Drs it wasn't the Nucala. After my third injection I was fine no side effects. 4 weeks later I received my 4th shot I had an anaphylactic shock 7 hours later and was hospitalized and intubated. After I pulled through I quit taking Nucala. I was eventually charged 11 thousand dollars for refusing to take the 6th dose. Gotta love the VA health care system. Nucala  works for some and I'm glad it can give those who respond well the relief they deserve. Just didn't work for me.",John

6,Nucala,Asthma,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 21, 2021",0,"I have a history of asthma. In 2017 exposed to black mold.  My asthma went into overdrive.  I coughed non stop for 2 years. No medications helped stop cough. Started Nucala in June 2020. My cough was gone in about 2 months. It has been wonderful to have my life back. But since I started using Nucala I have developed inflammatory arthritis. Its horrible and very painful. I did not associate it with Nucala until I read the reviews. I am worried if I stop Nucala, will my asthma symptoms come back? Is it actually causing my arthritis to go into overdrive? Plan ask dr about stopping Nucala to see if it might stop increasing arthritis.",Busymom

This never happened before so I took benadryl and have been icing it. Nucala worked amazing the first month and I felt like I got my life back, but it has not been controlling my severe eosinophilic asthma since.

11,Nucala,Asthma,10.0,,"March 11, 2021",3,"My daughter was prednisone dependent for the past few years due to severe asthma. She was on 8 puffs of ventolin Q2 at one point for weeks, even after a course of prednisone. That in itself should tell you how out of control it was.She has been on Nucala for 4 months now and it has been an absolute miracle. She does not need any inhaled steroids or even Ventolin anymore. I mean ZERO. She has felt this level of relief about 2 weeks after her first injection.  I cannot rave about this medication enough. But note that this is targeted for a very small subset of asthma patients. This will not help the majority of people suffering from asthma.",Asthmamom

13,Nucala,Asthma,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 5, 2021",1,Hi everyone I had an allergic reaction to Xolair and have been on Nucala for about 3 years now.  I always got headaches felt tired a day or two after I received the injection but today was different. I got the injection Wednesday today is Thursday and when I got home I wasn't feeling good real tired short of breath my heart was racing itchy throat pain in my shoulder and up my neck where I received the shot which I usually feel chest is sore and my oxygen was 92-93.  I went to the ER and the doctor told me not to get the injection any more. He did a chest x-ray gave me breathing treatments. The injection really gave me a better quality of life but I am scared to get it again unsure what to do. My pulmonologist is supposed to call me back Saturday and we're supposed to talk about getting the injection again or not. With xolair he said I could die if I get it again so of course I said no I don't want it has anyone else experienced this getting Nucala??,Weezy

16,Nucala,Asthma,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 26, 2020",6,I have been taking Nucala for 9 months.  I have severe persistent Eosinophilic Asthma. My asthma had a rapid onset and began about 2 years ago. I was completely healthy prior. I was using a nebulizer every 2-3 hrs around the clock and on 02 at 3-5L because my airways were so tight. 10 days after the first injection and I was no longer requiring oxygen or neb treatments.  Over the course of treatment I've had a few minor set backs but they've been small in comparison to what I was living prior. The first couple of months I had bad headaches and some back aches but both resolved with ibuprofen.  I get tired and flu like at times but a short rest usually takes care of that. I have minor skin issues and my hair has thinned a bit but those are things that I'm willing to deal with to have my life back. I can take my grandbaby on walks in her stroller and not be gasping for air. Nucala has been life changing for me.,Anonymous

Been taking a monthly shot for over 2 years now and I rarely use my rescue inhaler and have not had to take prednisone. Yahoo!  Before Nucala,   I had severe bronchitis episodes one after another. Was on heavy doses of prednisone which had begun not to help at all.  Thank goodness for Nucala.  I can go on walks again and be more active.",RannC
20,Nucala,Asthma,,,"August 23, 2020",4,I have just started Nucala  after being on fasenra for a year (to which I suffered severe side effects) just like what is mentioned in other reviews about Nucala. After reading many reviews I'm not sure about this drug. I had some fatigue and body aches after first injection but not really bad. So I will wait until next injection see how it effects me. Hopefully better than the fasenra.,Sc
21,Nucala,Asthma,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 13, 2020",7,I just had my 4th Nucala shot.I am not impressed. My severe asthma is still horrible. The shots seem to not help me. My pulmonologist said that I needed to try it through the 4th shot. I got it this morning and had 3 bad asthma attacks since then. I am going to contact my pulmonologist as soon as possible. I am not going to get anymore Nucala shots. Everyone of the shots did absolutely for my severe asthma.,Vetassistlady

23,Nucala,Asthma,1.0,,"June 10, 2020",15,"My doctor seems to be playing a guessing game with my asthma, but I guess that might be what everyone's pulmonary doctor does these days.  I had pneumonia and a horrible cough, and woke up in middle of the night unable to breathe even after six puffs on my inhaler.  Ever since that illness, five months later, I need a nebulizer treatment at least three times a day.  I started this drug on May 8th, and at the end of the first month developed a severe bladder infection. I am now a week into my second month, still having bladder infection issues, and absolutely NO change in my severe asthma symptoms.  The website indicates it can cause UTIs, so I fear that I have three more weeks of misery with a bladder infection AND severe asthma.  I am glad this works for some people, but it has done nothing but make me more miserable than I already was before I started the drug.",Lisa888999

I haven't noticed any significant change since switching to Nucala; I very much like that I get the injection only once a month compared to every 2 weeks with Xolair.

For the past three months, I have had excruciating joint pain in my knees, ankles, wrists, elbows and fingers to the point that I can not run at all or even walk without pain. While on nucala, my joints have always been hurting, but now it's just so much worse. I've also suffered from headaches, sore throat, muscle spasms, chest and back pain and some eczema. I lost half of my hair in the last two months and some of my eyebrows as well.Weird thing is, all was well for over a year and a half, except for some minor joint ache but then suddenly everything went bad really fast.Now I have to wait for a few months for nucala to leave my system, and hopefully things will return to normal.It did help with my asthma and nasal polyps, but now the side effects are just too much.",Always something wrong

I am up and down frequently, my pain meds not working well. I made an appointment to go back to the Dr  and see what can be done. I liked the results  of the Nucala and what it does for my breathing.

Which was amazing because I have become totally depend on it to breath.  My second nucala shot I started to notice several side effects,  severe back pain, stomach pain, urinary track infection and the final straw was severe muscle pain and spams. The pain I experience from the muscle spams is so bad I cry. I had to discontinue this drug.  I was very hopeful this would be the answer to my asthma.  So now I am back prednisone.",suyq

I have also been on steroids since I was 10. I had almost immediate results after my first injection. I haven’t used my rescue inhaler once, which is unheard of. However, my blood pressure has sky rocketed. The only thing I can relate that is new, is the Nucala. Also, I was approved for their co-payment program. Don’t be fooled. They claimed to cover anything Nucala related, up to $11,000 a year. Wrong. They’ve changed their process. After being approved for the program and starting it, now they want me to pay up front and they will reimburse me after its approved. It’s been hell to get reimbursed (I haven't seen a $1) and fee’s are racking up quickly. Even the doctors office doesn’t understand their billing. To save my credit rating, I will have to pay for the fee’s and discontinue Nucala. Their co-pay program is terrible!!! Don’t be fooled!",George

I’ve lost 30% of my hair. Severe dry skin on face. Arthritic pain. Headaches. Nucala has helped me tremendously, but I’m so upset about all my thinning/lost hair. I’ve had every blood test done.

I have lost nearly half my long beautiful hair in just the last three weeks. I have added no other meds and it seems each month as Nucala has built in my system, side effects have increased for me. As much as it has alleviated my eosinophilic asthma, I can’t live with out hair or with this chronic sore throat. I am going to an ENT soon to rule out any other cause as my general doctor nor allergist can find no cause for the throat discomfort. I am also going for blood work on Monday to check for other issues than can cause sudden hair loss, but I am betting I will have to go off this medication.",Leigh
35,Nucala,Asthma,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 2, 2019",26,"I have had 2 shots of Nucala over the past 5 weeks. It improved my asthma immediately. I estimate within a couple of hours the mucus, congestion and infection in my respiratory system had gone completely. However ... the side effects for me have possibly been even worse. Since the first injection I have had constant arthritic pain in my feet, back and jaw.  I've also had the worst gout attack in my life. This pain has been nothing like I've previously experienced and it's affected my lifestyle significantly. I also have the minor flu-like symptoms. Although this is relatively mild, it's constant. I won't go away. I honestly don't know if I will be able to continue on Nucala. I'll need to make a call on that over the next 3 weeks. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?",Sid

I reckon within maybe 2-3 hours of the first injection, most of my asthma/respiratory infection symptoms had gone. Prior to that I had suffered years of chronic sinus and chest infections. But ... since I've had the Nucala, I've had the worst 'arthritis'-like symptoms in my feet (especially) and lower back. TBH there are days I can hardly walk. I can't exercise at all due to the pain and inconvenience. I also have the flu-like symptoms others have mentioned on this blog.

45,Nucala,Asthma,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 8, 2018",6,Nucala makes it so difficult to get the injection that by the time you find a facility that will do it your so worn out you give up.

46,Nucala,Asthma,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 25, 2018",11,"Nucala has turned my life around.  I did not expect the immediate relief I experienced after the first injection.  I used to get such a build up of mucus in my lungs that I'd have to stop half-way to the bathroom and sit down to cough up a lung.  I used to choke on the mucus so badly that sometimes I'd almost blackout.  I effortlessly walked the half-mile home after my last injection!  I went from going to the ER every 4 to 6 weeks, with 5 hospital stays in a 7 month period, to forgetting to use my nebulizer!  I had to get special permission from my employer's insurance to cover this med and it's currently up for review, so I've got my fingers crossed right now.  I'm optimistic because it has been so successful.

49,Nucala,Asthma,,,"February 15, 2018",17,I have been on this drug for 8 years.  ( It was a clinical trial when I began) I was diagnosed with HES (hypereosinophilia) and it was attacking my lungs the most.  Chronic pneumonia/lung infections and asthma.  Despite a healthy lifestyle I could no longer walk a flight of stairs or even half a block without being winded and dizzy.  Steroid use exacerbated the infections.  My dr suggested the mepolizumab clinical trial.  The dose was much higher via IV when I started and results were apparent within a week.  Main side effect was nausea which has subsided with the lower dose.  I now get monthly injections and am perfectly healthy.   I work out daily and am very fit.  I still have some mild asthma symptoms but rare and easily controlled without prednisone.  Haven’t noticed any long term use side effects.I believe this drug saved my life.  Downside is cost...   Hopefully you have a great drug plan to cover it.  But I would definitely recommend trying it!,TerraCh

52,Nucala,Asthma,,,"August 31, 2017",21,"Diagnosed borderline asthma when I was 21. Over the years it has steadily worsened. 8 years ago, I became steroid dependant. Other than that nothing worked. I was on literally everything I could be on and it just wasn't enough.  I was afraid my pulmonologist would give me up for a lost cause. Started Nucala in January 2017. It wasn't instant, and I actually missed 2 doses, April and May. When I restarted in June, it was like something clicked. I can now participate in activities with family and friends. Almost off the steroids completely. Could not be happier with these results!",JODYb686
53,Nucala,Asthma,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 15, 2017",37,"I've had asthma since I was 18. Over the last 36 years, it has gotten progressively worse. My lungs were always congested and breathing was always labored. Prednisone used to work for a few months and clear up those symptoms but not anymore.  Already in my 50s and my breathing getting steadily worse, I did some research to find the best respiratory hospital in the USA. In July 2015 which I went to and I was diagnosed with eociniphilic asthma but Nucala wasn't yet approved. I started Nucala in April 2017. By the fourth shot, I'm a new person. I can breathe without lung congestion and haven't used my rescue inhaler at all in five weeks. It's a miracle drug! Thank you GlaxoSmthKline!!",Lseidman62
54,Nucala,Asthma,10.0,,"May 21, 2017",39,"I suffered from severe asthma for the past 4 years. I was hospitalized several times, despite using 4 different asthma medications. Nothing seemed to control my symptoms for very long, except high doses of prednisone. After a blood test, and some pre-approval from my insurance company, my doctor finally got me approved for Nucala. Nucala has been a life changer. I can finally breathe much easier, I'm able to exercise, enjoy the outdoors & I rarely have asthma attacks now.",Bcbssm11
55,Nucala,Asthma,1.0,,"March 27, 2017",34,"I've always had bad asthma as a kid. I was constantly had to be put on steroids. My Dr did an IgE test and mine were over 1,500 (less than 100 is normal) I was put on Nucala for 5 months. At the time of the first injection my lung function was at 86% at the time of the fifth injection I was at around 35%. While on this drug I felt so sick! Back pain, head ache, nausea, fatigue. I felt like I had the flu everyday! We decided to stop the drug. (I am still looking for a new treatment option)",Lexi_00
56,Nucala,Asthma,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 9, 2017",82,"My doctor told me that it might take time to work, yet, my asthma symptoms disappeared the first day! I have suffered with asthma for thirteen years. After a few years with an inhaled cortical steroid, I developed Cushings' syndrome, so I could no longer take them.My doctors have tried to control my asthma with a combination of medications not containing steroids, including some COPD meds. Over the years, my symptoms became more severe and more frequent. For the past several years, I was bedridden about half the time. I had asthma attacks even with no common triggers. I used a nebulizer and albuterol six times a day. Since starting Nucala two months ago, I am symptom free and up from bed, living my glorious life!",Happy and Healthy
