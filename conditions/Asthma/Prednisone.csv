0,Prednisone,Asthma,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 28, 2021",0,"I use prednisone twice a year. Spring and Winter. I get a cold and then I end up with a chest infection. My combined inhaler Fostair helps briefly, but the short burst steroid treatment usually works. I usually take 40mg for 5 days, see if it makes a difference. If not I then take a second dosage another 40mg for 5 days which usually does the trick. I do get side effects like jittery, insomnia if taken in the evening and I get a bit wired, where I talk a lot and cannot sit still. Moon face with lots of water retention and the last time I ended up with a UTI, but that's because I went into a paddling pool on my last day of taking back to back steroid treatment.",Ashie

The side effects of the INHALER have led to a tranquilizer addiction! Prednisone is amazing I am no longer sick and miserable when I get a higher dose, however doctors hate it and cut my dose down to 5mg which is just enough to keep me from dying.

I was diagnosed with age related asthma and mild copd in 2004 and started taking steroids in 2005.  It was OK first of all, with just the occasional 5 days dose of 30mg.  Then that didn't work and I was prescribed 7 days at 40 mg with 1 week to phase off.  Then this dose only worked when I was taking it and I struggled for a couple of weeks before I had to give in and start another course.  I had to be able to breath.  A couple of years ago I took things into my own hands and told the Dr. I was going to try and get off of these toxic pills.  His reaction was ""you haven't got a choice.""

After the third day, the anxiety and crushing depression I was feeling with the medication caused me to go back to the doctor, and she told me to come off it immediately. I was not told to taper off, which I now know is a bad idea. I spent a good 10 days suffering withdrawal effects, and had dark thoughts. It took me 9 months to start feeling myself again. I had debilitating joint pain, so much so that I was tested for lupus,RA, and other joint/ connective tissue disorders. I was also very depressed.

After two nights of wheezing & barely sleeping, I went to the doc yesterday for prednisone. Within a few hours, I could breath freely again.

27,Prednisone,Asthma,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 10, 2017",20,"I wish I could give this medication zero stars, and I am an RN. Prednisone has ruined my life. I was given prednisone for a severe viral lung infection (I have asthma) back in August 2016; I had a 104F fever for a week and lost almost 15 lbs. The doctor (with horrible bedside manner) had pressured me to take Prednisone (60 mg) in the office ...even-though I only came in for an I.V., due to severe dehydration. I was started on 60 mg (and was supposed to take 40 mg for the next 5 days). Little did I know that it can cause mania and psychosis (I have a history of depression). By the 2nd day I couldn't sleep (I kept talking, cleaning, and writing poetry) and had a manic episode, due to steroid psychosis (and I don't have a history of bipolar disorder). No one in my family knew what was wrong with me. I am WARNING any of you with a psychiatric history to avoid this medication and oral steroids at all costs. Due to taking Prednisone, I lost a full-year college scholarship (I'm studying laboratory science)... (due to being hospitalized) and my housing. I also lost a ton of hair, and it is super thin now. I had to be hospitalized 3 times in the span of the year due to this med causing  suicidal depression after the manic episode. It is depressing that I lost so much money due to copay medical bills amounting to 5k, and I cannot sue the doctor/outpatient clinic for the lost money and time, and my housing (was asked to move out due to mania/steroid psychosis). I will never take another oral steroid (even if I am on the brink of dying and I'd rather die instead). Taking prednisone has resulted in so much embarrassment and humiliation for myself. I have no idea what's worse...the 104F fever and coughing, or taking this medication. Take this medication at your own risk.

I wish I read reviews before starting the dose, as I look back antibiotics should have been sufficient for my symptoms - I only had Acute bronchitis. The problem came when I completed my dose and the withdrawal symptoms kicked in. I started shaking, couldn't see clearly, my heart started beating fast, very anxious, couldn't sleep, fell like I was literally losing it! Almost ended up in the ER, but following other reviews decided to find ways to relax and not think about what was happening: yoga, meditation, playing sleep music and that's how I managed it.

52,Prednisone,Asthma,7.0,,"May 5, 2011",39,"Like the other commentators, when my asthma is really, really bad and all my other medications together are not enough, prednisone does make me better. But for me prednisone has had a bad side effect- I now have mild cataracts. So I avoid taking it as much as I can.",Anonymous
53,Prednisone,Asthma,8.0,,"December 9, 2010",42,"I get bronchial asthma every time I get sick and although prednisone does wonders and allows you to breath, I get bad nausea so the medicine itself is wonderful but my reaction is awful. Other medicines that are helpful are Pulmicort and Zithromax, an antibiotic.",Anonymous
54,Prednisone,Asthma,8.0,,"October 1, 2009",82,"Although the thought of using a steroid is pretty iffy in my mind, prednisone is a strong anti-inflammatory drug that I have been prescribed several times after asthma attacks. It always seems to work although my asthma continues to be a problem, it certainly helps me breathe a whole lot better. I don't use my inhaler as much and I can sleep through the nights without waking up in a fit of coughing.",Yeayayea

56,Prednisone,Asthma,9.0,,"September 27, 2009",62,I had two straight severe asthma attacks. Prednisone combined with my puffers really made me feel a lot better. It really helped with the inflammation.,Anonymous
57,Prednisone,Asthma,9.0,,"March 11, 2009",49,Good inflammation clear up rate on each use. Eventually kept on and weaned off dropping 1 per week over several weeks. Definite facial/body hair and fluid retention/roundness of face.,witts
58,Prednisone,Asthma,5.0,,"February 7, 2009",68,"I had a sinus infection and was prescribed prednisone, erythrocin and albuterol all together. After my first treatment of only antibiotics - it did not do the job.  Not really sure what each of them are responsible for EXACTLY.  Erythromycin is the antibiotic and albuterol is for opening air tight passageways in the lungs that caused wheezing [asmathic reaction due to the sinus infection]. The prednisone, while I don't like the idea of taking a steroid, did a good job of helping to recover.  The only side effect I noticed was an increase in appetite.",DemiGod
59,Prednisone,Asthma,10.0,,"January 28, 2009",87,"I too get an asthma like cough once or twice a year following a cold. Usually I can treat with my puffers but this last attack had my husband taking me to the hospital because I couldn't breathe and the usual treatments weren't working. Prednisone has been so very helpful, I can breath again!",Anonymous
60,Prednisone,Asthma,10.0,,"August 26, 2008",91,"I get that terrible cough twice a year along with my upper respiratory infection (including sinus infection), and no antibiotic worked so far (tried few different ones). My only relief was brought by Prednisone treatment. Although, I am a person who does not take medicines just for anything, I was very open to prednisone.",Anonymous
61,Prednisone,Asthma,8.0,,"July 3, 2008",114,It stopped the cough and wheezing. I was on 20mg to start and then cut back to 10 mg and then 5mg. I've not had anything work as well.,livlog
