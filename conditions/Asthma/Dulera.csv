0,Dulera,Asthma,9.0,,"April 21, 2021",9,"I use low dose 100ug, corticosteroids have side effects including OTC. I've  tried all brands and Dulera works best for me. My pre existing conditions did come to surface.I treated those with Flonase .I get really bad year round allergic rhinitis and post nasal drainage is a pain. I have moderate to severe allergies, asthma. Warning state to contact doc if I’m exposed to certain illness, having certain condition. I was worse when I combined with certain prescription so I started to keep a log. I had many issues before I started taking dulera. It’s hard to control environment. It helps me reduce use of my rescue.I also read the instructions-shaking well, rinse mouth, gargle after use. I brush my teeth usually 30 minutes later.I have tapered my dose also to take periodic brakes . Using my rescue during that time. Keeping my immune system up as best as I can allows me to continue this inhaler. I’ve just tried so many and got tired of not being able to get enough oxygen.(hypoxia as one ER called it)",Anonymous
1,Dulera,Asthma,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 14, 2021",7,"I have had asthma since I was a kid. I was given Dulera when my insurance wouldn’t cover Advair and I wish it did. I have been using Dulera for the past 4 weeks. The first week was fine but these past three weeks, absolutely terrible. I have created more mucus than I have ever created, and it’s to a point where it makes me choke. I also have blood in my mucus, which I have gone to my doctors about. I have taken so many covid tests because I have been coughing my head off and having intense tightness of chest. My blood pressure and heart rate shot through the roof, I developed a tremor. I have had more things happen to me from this one inhaler it’s nuts.",cj
2,Dulera,Asthma,,,"January 13, 2021",3,"I was prescribed Dulera as an alternative to Advair, when my insurance stopped covering it. I was skeptical at first, having positive response from Advair. After 2 weeks of taking Dulera, not only did my asthma symptoms worsen, but I started experiencing other horrible symptoms, including chest tightness, heart palpitations, severe headache, nervousness, foginess, and fatigue. I also developed excruciating abdominal pain, that radiated from front to back, similar to severe period cramping, but deeper and throbbed. I immediately stopped taking Dulera, but this cramping pain never went went away. I eventually went to several specialists, including an OBGYN, who can only conclude that I had a dormant/ mild form of endometriosis that was exacerbated by the Dulera. Years later, I still suffer from this pain, with no cure or remedy- I can only hope to find others with a similar story, so we can file a class action suit against them. This medicine is dangerous.",Marsha K.

4,Dulera,Asthma,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 23, 2020",12,"I've suffered from asthma since childhood and have been treated with, as I know being a pharmacist, almost every type of asthma medication available.  Currently, I use Dulera as needed instead of albuterol.   The current US treatment guidelines for asthma are old and due for an update which I anticipate will advocate this strategy.  During Spring season I begin taking Singulair and begin using Dulera routinely, twice a day everyday, until pollen levels go down.  This combination is so effective for me during Spring time, it is no longer a dreaded time of year.  In fact, allergy symptoms that add insult to injury, so to speak, are virtually a thing of the past.  Because of Singulair I no longer require antihistamines in the Spring and frankly, may be able to ""get by"" with using Dulera only as needed.",Pharmacist
5,Dulera,Asthma,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 22, 2020",6,"After an asthma attack a month ago. A doctor at urgent care prescribed me this. A week later I saw my allergist who told me to stop dulera. She put me on singulair. I was not able to pick up my prescription so I continued using dulera. The first week of using it, I could breath a lot better however- now after a month use. My body has experienced chest tightness, lung twitching & heart palpitations. My body feels off. I don’t like the chest tightness and weird heart palpitations. I will be discontinuing this until I get my other asthma medication.",Mimi

7,Dulera,Asthma,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 4, 2020",2,I've had asthma my entire life to the point I would pass out from being unable to breathe and many times felt I'd never make it to the hospital. Dulera is the first med in 50 years to completely free me from this condition. I've been attack free for 2 years. Now the pharmacist tells me it's been discontinued. Please tell me that's not true,J
8,Dulera,Asthma,8.0,,"December 6, 2019",0,"I've been on Dulera for the past year or more. It helped significantly. However, I've used up the coupon where it only costs $15 and now it is $405 and I can no longer afford it. After reading that others have had shaky hands, heart palpitations, and weigh gain, I'm realizing that I have those issues too and it might be the Dulera. I guess I'll find out since I'm not taking it anymore. :(",SuzyQ
9,Dulera,Asthma,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 3, 2019",2,"I have severe asthma and my heart stopped on father’s day this year’ from having a asthma attack. It’s the second time I’ve gone into cardiac arrest from an attack & waking up the next day on life support.  Since June I’ve been on Dulera taking 2 puffs twice a day, & it has helped tremendously’ I can breathe!! I’ve gone from constantly short of breathe’ waking up in the middle of night in attacks’ it was awful., the only thing that’s scaring me tho is’ I’m gaining weight’ I’ve put on about 10-15 pounds since June’ Without changing my diet, I’ve noticed I feel hungry a lot’ I’ve always had a little weight on me’ but I don’t want to get to that point where I’m depressed about my weight’ I already get that way as it is..

Frequently.  I am SO relieved that this is from the DULARA and if I stop it this will all go away.  I have developed shaking my hands and fingers as well... I don't know if this is related.",Qusie
11,Dulera,Asthma,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 2, 2019",11,The weight gain (15# in two months) and headaches are not worth the slight benefit I might get from Dulera over time. I’ll look for other ways to manage the asthma.,Icarus
12,Dulera,Asthma,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 20, 2018",14,I've been on Dulera for about 14 days now. I'm sleeping better w/ less coughing. The side effect I'm having is the worst case of thrush. Anyone else have this issue? If so what did you do to treat it? Did you have to get medication from the Dr. ?,dndlee91
13,Dulera,Asthma,,,"February 14, 2018",20,"I tried Dulera for a week and did not like it. I was diagnosed with mild asthma at age 30 but probably had it most of my life--just assumed everyone felt like they couldn't breathe sometimes. :) Doctor prescribed the 100mcg dose, two puffs in the morning and two in the evening. I did that the first day, and that night, I felt very agitated, couldn't sleep, felt depressed, and had depressing thoughts. I struggled a bit with depression as a teen, but I hadn't felt that way in 5-10 years before taking Dulera. I cut down to 1 puff in the morning and felt much better on days 2-5, but by day 6, I was starting to feel depressed again. Stopped the Dulera and feeling back to normal like myself. Maybe I am more prone to these side effects because I've had a history of depression, but these were very scary side effects. I also felt like I was losing my voice by day 6. To be fair it did reduce my nighttime coughing... but not worth the side effects for my mild asthma.",Kenieara

15,Dulera,Asthma,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 22, 2017",19,"I've been on and off Dulera for several years.  After using it regularly for a month or two I invariably get a low-level infection in my lungs/bronchial tubes.  Major yellow-to-brown phlegm, constantly coughing.Then when I go off Dulera, after a few days the infection self-cures and the phlegm and coughing subside.  But then of course the asthma comes back.For me there's no magic solution (yet!).  I'll probably not use Dulera any more, too afraid of the infections it encourages.",Neil in NC
16,Dulera,Asthma,,,"August 9, 2017",13,"I just quit using dulera two days ago because I was having the quivering pain in my leg and arm.  Also, been experiencing pain in my chest/breast area.  Also, even after two days of not being on the dulera I feel that my lungs are more open than they were on the dulera.  I have switched back to using proair and qvar.

19,Dulera,Asthma,1.0,,"May 13, 2017",36,"I took Dulera 200 for about 3 months.  After a month I experienced heart palpitations (heart rate from 80 to 188 in seconds).  At first it would only last 2-3 minutes.  Then palpitations lasted over an hour, then two hours.  Ended up in the ER four times, twice to receive an IV drug to reset and slow my heart beat.  Cardiologist at the hospital put me on Diltiazem to control my heart rate.  It lowered blood pressure (was already good), but did not stop heart palpitations.  Began having breathing problems and doctor increased Diltiazem dosage.  Experienced worse breathing issues and loss of bladder control.  Finally realized the Diltiazem caused breathing problems and Dulera was causing the racing heart palpitations.  Nightmare!",Susan Y
20,Dulera,Asthma,9.0,,"September 14, 2016",23,"Had infrequent asthma all my life (I am 63) but never had to use an inhaler regularly. After a cold turned into pneumonia plus a sinus infection, my doc said to use my ProAir HFA inhaler more often. But serious asthma had set in and I wasn't getting relief. Burning sensation in lungs, difficulty breathing, no energy, was not resting well...you guys know the drill. After two puffs of Dulera, the burning sensation was reduced, lungs felt more relaxed and I could breathe more deeply. I slept better last night and awoke feeling rested...wow! After two puffs this morning (at 5:30 a.m.) I felt the burning completely subside. Feel so much better. Even sinus pressure reduced. Looking forward to feeling good again. Hope is in sight.",KatieMo

23,Dulera,Asthma,10.0,,"April 10, 2016",17,"I have had asthma since infancy.  (I am now 81!)  I have probably used all the common medications - i.e. albuterol, singulair, etc., etc. in my lifetime.  Dulera allows me the luxury of one puff at night, and a good night's sleep.  I am otherwise very healthy having long ago given up the things that are bad for health, like smoking, eating sweets, alcohol, and I have a wonderful life!  So part of it is the medication, and part of it is up to me - my lifestyle.",heatherseawa
24,Dulera,Asthma,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2016",24,"I just took the first puff,  15 minutes ago. I don't want to chant victory,  but I am breathing much better!  One thing I need to tell anyone who's using asthma inhalers, that after using it, you always have to rinse your mouth, to avoid oral thrush. I got this medicine from a pulmonologist I was referred to, after I couldn't control my asthma, and went into acute bronquitis, three months in a row.Ten more minutes passed,  and  I'm actually breathing!  No shakes, no fainting,  no shortness of breath...I feel like I'm calming down.The one thing I'm always afraid, is corticoids, because of their side effects, but if I can feel this well, I  will try to watch my weight, and take more calcium, for osteoporosis.

28,Dulera,Asthma,9.0,,"October 5, 2014",31,Dulera works great and I have noticed it has improved my breathing by 100%. It seems to work better than my rescue inhaler. Down side of it is that I have gotten infections in the tonsils and sinusitis. Also I've been having blood clots in my mucus and when I cough I phlegm I notice it's a dark brown reddish color. Frequent migraines and insomnia some nights.  Feeling of unconsciousness when laying down.,Darius Washington

32,Dulera,Asthma,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 31, 2013",31,"I've used this twice now and it has been great! Much better than similar inhalers.  I had pneumonia that was not resolving and this was prescribed, within two days I had dramatic improvement. 2nd time I had sudden asthmatic flare and was crashing not resolving well same thing within 2 days dramatic improvement. Downside it makes me very shaky for a short duration maybe up to 2 hours. Seems to increase the appetite slightly. Also a slightly foggy headed feel but fades soon. Mind you this is in conjunction with oral steroids so some effects might be less if the others were removed.
