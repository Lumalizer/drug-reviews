My son was on Singulair from the age of 5 until 19. While it did help his asthma, the side affects are not worth it. As a child, he could never sleep, had tremors, sweat like crazy, had anxiety & depression. Watch you child when they get to high school because something can change at that age & it seems the depression get worse suicidal thoughts began. My son stopped his meds on his own. Felt a lot better. Started having asthma issues so started is again at college for a couple weeks. He is old enough now to be able to identify his feelings. He told me he stopped taking it & will never take it again because it made him suicidal",Okie I'm

I was worried about the mental side effects described here as I have a history of anxiety, depression and panic attacks. Honestly my mood has greatly improved on Singulair, probably since I can breathe better now and there's less inflammation in my body. On rainy days I still get congestion and need to clear my throat often but no breathing troubles. I get Singulair on Picnic which has been great; don't need to call or see the doc for refills.",Shan
4,Singulair,Asthma,3.0,,"March 28, 2021",19,"On this medication I could finally sleep at night, literally. It helped so much with my asthma and my allergies. I could take deep breaths again. I needed my inhaler much less. But unfortunately like many others.. after three months of taking this (it takes time to build up in your system) I developed severe depression and I was very suicidal. Thankfully, I have a support system that I alerted of this possible side effect, and they were there for me. I went to my doctor and she advised to stop taking it (as I uncontrollably cried in the office) and I felt better within a week of being off it. Don’t let my experience scare you, because I really went back to normal as soon as I got off it. I have yet to find a new medication that makes my asthma/allergy so nonexistent!",suffi
5,Singulair,Asthma,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 21, 2021",31,"I started Singulair some 15-20 years ago. After 12 months developed dry eyes (in the worst way) seeing problems (cataracts) and angina. After stopping taking the drug,  the angina went away and so did the dry eyes. Cataracts were removed. Fast forward to  2018. Nothing was helping the Asthma and agreed to go back on Singulair again, after 6 months the same exact problems came back had to stop. Angina and blurring eye site. I am now on Symbicort  now for 3 months and the same thing  has started to happen. Both meds work very well, but the side effects are the worst",MadMax

7,Singulair,Asthma,6.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 9, 2020",21,"I was on Singulair for many years. It helped allergies and asthma significantly. However, I also had a significant problem with depression.  My doctor told me to stop taking it when she read about the correlation with depression.  After a few weeks I felt so much better mood-wise, but my allergy and asthma symptoms are that much worse.  I was already taking Zyrtec (it has now been raised to a double dose), Flonase, Azelastin (a recent addition), Sudafed as needed, and Chlorpheniramine as needed.  Doubling the Zyrtec was supposed to eliminate the need for the last two, but the taste of Azelastin is so unpleasant that the urge to just go back to Sudafed is very strong.  I'm resisting because of age and HBP.  The sinus clog/drip is ever-present. Retiring to Delaware has been great for our finances, very tough on allergies/asthma, slightly worse than northern Virginia.  And I hear there's really no place to ""hide.""",Bookcat

9,Singulair,Asthma,1.0,,"March 9, 2020",182,"Be careful! After years of being misdiagnosed, I was given Singulair.  Within 4 weeks, I no longer needed my nebulizer or rescue inhalers.  I gradually became more tired, and extremely agitated. I began hearing voices in my own home and I live alone.  It got worse, not better.  One night, I was convinced someone was in my home. Every light in the house was on. I still kept seeing someone!Coming from a military background, and secure in owning firearms, I was searching my home with a gun. I was looking for an intruder who was NOT there! That was my final straw. I threw my Singulair in the garbage. I’m still agitated and frustrated. I am going to try over the counter medication deemed safe. I’m not sure how long the agitation and tiredness will last.  I pray this will help someone.  Please be careful on this medicine. For me, it’s not worth it. In 55 years, I’ve never seen anyone, or heard voices in my home, until Singulair. (5 weeks total taking it)",Angie
10,Singulair,Asthma,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 18, 2020",84,My asthma came back strong at about age 46. I tried everything. I couldn't exist without an inhaler nearby. Couldn't sleep at night for more than 2 or 3 hours at a time. Woke up constantly always coughing. Additionally always had sinus infections. This drug has been a life-changer for me. It is a miracle. I haven't experienced any noticeable negative side effects. The first couple days I had some dizzy spells but they subsided. I can't say enough good things about how this has helped me. I went to a couple pulmonologist several emergency rooms and urgent cares along with my primary no one ever recommended this finally I found a ra or PA I don't know but she prescribed this for me and I am forever grateful.,Laz

Once on it,  for the first time in many years I was no longer waking up wheezing and with shortness of breath at night. It's been wonderful!  Fortunately, I have never had any of the side effects noted by others. I remember feeling early on that singulair  may have contributed to weight gain, but it was  very hard to tell as I was at that age - late 40s -  when this begins to happen naturally. If so, I certainly would have preferred to not to gain weight, but the benefits of having a ""normal"" life with singulair have been fantastic",l2t233

30,Singulair,Asthma,1.0,,"May 4, 2015",67,Worst experience of my life by far! First off you can expect to have side affects 4-6 weeks after you last dose. I had to be put on anxiety medication because I became extremely distraught. I had night terrors thoughts of hurting myself and other even my dog. I managed to separate those thoughts from who I knew I was but the emotional impact is so real. I also became paranoid that I was someone I was not! Best advice is first get on an anxiety medication so that you can deal with the daily thoughts. I'm not saying stay on it forever just while you wait out those weeks. Other key thing is have somone you can call 24/7 and talk to about the thoughts that know how you are regularly. Luckly I still have my mother.,Keeping the faith

It still is a very strong and it knocked me out, but I didn't have to worry about calling 911 or not waking up from it.  Asthma is tough to treat.  Medicine is necessary, but sometimes the meds are as bad as the disease.  My advice is to start with the lowest dosage your doctor thinks will work.
