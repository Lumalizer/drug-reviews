1,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,1.0,,"March 6, 2022",0,"Horrible experience! First week nothing, then headaches, high BP, dizziness and fatigue.  After 27 days I couldn’t take it anymore. Things got worse all symptoms increased and chills and joint aches started. At 70,  worse experience ever to prescription medicine. Two weeks off and still not normal. By the way it, never helped my breathing.",CJnobreo
2,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 12, 2022",0,I started taking Breo and it worked fine.  After a day or two my voice started getting hoarse and raspy.  Then I started getting cramps with bloating and diarrhea for the next week.  I have been off of it for two days and it seems to be getting better.  It's too bad that it works but the side effects are not worth it.,Gamble
3,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 27, 2022",0,100% successful in treating my asthma which was originally mis-diagnosed as COPD. Chronic cough and respiratory infections have disappeared with the daily use of Breo. I have not had to use a rescue inhaler in over four years and have had no flareups of any kind. Very easy to use and no side effects.,Akguy
4,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 20, 2022",0,"Perhaps I’m one of the fortunate ones that has had his life changed.  It is expensive, like way too expensive, even with my top of the line medical coverage supplied by the hospital where I work.  There is no way that any medicine should cost this much.  It has been almost like a rebirth as to how much difference it makes in my day to day.  I have no side effects of any or those I’ve read so far.  I have learned a few things to make the delivery of this med easier and more effective because the delivery method is not ideal. I take 5 or 6 slow easy breaths, as hard as that can be to do sometimes, with my mouth open, to dry my airway.   The less moisture, the better the powder will be delivered.  Exhale all the air out that you can, pinch nose, inhale steady and full.  Hold as long as you can.  Then, only exhale partially, and inhale to max, repeat a few times.  The med last about 12-14 hours, not 24 or whatever they say.  Peace.",Xodarap1

8,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 5, 2021",0,I had an awful reaction to just one dose of Breo.  Itching and burning in my ears and throat.  Runny nose.  Tachycardia.  Wheezing.  Adrenal insufficiency the following morning.  I had to use my Flovent inhaler.  That was the first and last time I would use Breo.  I urge everyone to read the reviews and to read the side effects on the Breo website as this is a very expensive and dangerous experiment.,No to Breo
9,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 28, 2021",0,"I was recently diagnosed with asthma after I started having shortness of breath and difficulty catching my breath.  I had had these symptoms twice previously in 53 years.  They started to go away after a couple of months.  I started taking Breo Ellipta five days ago.  At first, it caused rapid heartbeat that was very uncomfortable.  The doctor said this was probably temporary.  After that, I started having pain and tightness in my chest, especially when I raise my hands above my head.  Last  night, I had trouble sleeping, even with generic Xanax (Alprazolam).  I've been able to breathe better, but I'm not sure the side effects are worth it.",catlover

The difference was immediately noticeable, by the end of the first week I no longer felt the need for my ""reliever"" and I have not touched it for 3 weeks now even sometimes forgetting to take it to work with me,  never before in all those years did I dare go anywhere without my ""reliever"" so I can not rate Breo high enough for the change in life it has given to me, just amazing!",Kowboy

Nothing has changed yet.  I still cough every few minutes.  The doctor said it could take up to 8 weeks.  I honestly don't see this working for me.  I was on inhalers 5 years ago too for same issue and none of them worked either.,Lori
13,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 30, 2021",1,This has helped me tremendously.  The first couple weeks on it I felt I was coughing just as much and at times more after taking it.  That began to slowly stop.  I now feel much better.  Coughing is cut in half from my usual.  I do not have side effects from the inhaler.  I do notice that I have to really rinse my mouth after to prevent thrush.  But that is stated in the leaflet provided.,Lee

Today I can run 5 miles without even glancing at my rescue. Please talk to your doctor because Breo has been a life changer for me even while I was still smoking it helped so so much.",Jason

From the first day, I could breath well, back to running five miles without stopping to catch my breath. My insurance will not cover this drug, so I was grateful for the coupon.

I’ve been on Breo 200 for almost a year for my moderate asthma, since I had trouble controlling it after a bout of double pneumonia last year when I thought I was going have my life end from an asthma attack. My asthma has never been so incredibly well-controlled and I have no side effects except, unfortunately, 15 pounds of extra weight. I still sleep like a baby and my anxiety is about as much as it always has been. Don’t be scared- try it for yourself and then make your own decision with your doctor!",Christine

23,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 11, 2020",27,"Do the drug manufactures even bother reading these. This drug Breo Ellipta does NOT last 24 hours. Fraudulent claims , it lasts 12 tops . A respiratory therapist told me that GSK knows it doesn't last that long. Good luck even getting it into your lungs. Worst possible delivery system . MAKE THIS DRUG IN A NEBULIZER FORM so we actually get the full benefit. Just shows how these drug companies are in it for the money. This is a great drug. Sad that most don't actually get to experience it to its entirety because of the crappy delivery system.",Karen
24,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,2.0,,"May 8, 2020",22,"How I wish I could use Breo regularly!? Nothing I’ve tried is more effective for  breathing; HOWEVER, as I type this, I’m experiencing nausea, occasional flushing with cold sweats, increased heart rate, increased HBP and blood sugar, anxiety, depressed mood. I’ve entered the ER twice in the past trying this drug (never knew one could develop flu condition from a drug!). I had bronchitis two months ago (took antibiotic and prednisone) and have just not fully recovered. Wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing. I resumed Breo one puff every 5-6 days for relief. I knew better than to repeat a dose earlier.  I keep Breo on hand for severe asthma flare ups - I know - stupid. Amazing what those of us with asthma will risk to breathe! It will take around three days for the side effects to vanish. I’ll swear I’ll never use it again. I hope Breo doesn’t become the next Vioxx! It's side effects can be severe.",Susan

Since I have been on Breo, past 4 years, I have not had to use my rescue inhaler. In fact, my pulsox always used to read between 91 and 93% on room air. Now it reads 95 to 97% on room air. When I take long deep breaths I no longer cough. Not sure whether the weight gain is a side effect or because I've always had the tendency to be a ""fatty patty"".  I'll blame the med. LOL",Leeparr
26,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,1.0,,"April 16, 2020",16,"Thanks to all the lysol being sprayed in the office my asthma flared up and my doctor decided on Breo.It worked great the first 2 days minus the intense headache and palpitations (i called in sick both days). On the 3 day I had a very aggressive migraine 5mins after taking the inhaler. My left arm went numb up to my neck. Fortunately a benadryl seemed to help but I immediately started puking for the next 12 hours. I slept every minute I could but woke up to intense chills that made me puke again. Since this was a Saturday I had to wait til Monday to see my doctor. When they took my vitals I was hypertensive with 143 heart rate. While it's not uncommon my heart rate to be 100-110, my blood pressure rarely changes let alone spike to hypertensive levels. Now over a week later I'm stuck with dry irritated feeling lungsAgain my flare up at the time was relatively minor and could have been treated way easier and cheaper with a standard steroid inhaler.",NopeNopeNope
27,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 31, 2020",9,Best inhaler I've ever used and I've had asthma for 40 years. I've been air lifted 3 times due to this condition. The only thing I hate about it is the sore throat but that's child's play compared to mot being able to walk 1 step without gasping for air. I'll take it forever,Slick

29,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 3, 2020",80,Pros : It reduces the need for bronchodilators....sort of. IF you can get a full dose. Works better than most products but the side effects are not worth it.  Cons: Anxiety . High blood pressure. ANXIETY. Afraid to leave the house alone anxiety. Fast heart rate. I just do not feel well. Muscle and joint aches . Restless legs . This drug needs to be reinvestigated by the FDA .,Tracy
30,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,7.0,,"January 24, 2020",24,Breo is an awesome product. Terrible way to inhale it. Most of it ends up in your mouth. I don't know how people with COPD or old people are expected to use this. It requires a great deal of lung power to just inhale it.    Does not last for 24 hours. Someone said it lasts for about 14 hours and they are correct.,Deb
31,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 11, 2019",26,"Works great IF you can actually get it into your lungs, but the delivery system is garbage, most of it was in my throat.

32,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 23, 2019",57,I am a person who believes in natural medicines/homeopathic as much as possible.  I was really struggling with asthma symptoms this past summer and felt horrible so I went into an asthma specialist as a last resort after trying everything natural that I could put my hands on.  She put me on Breo and I felt like I had found a miracle cure.  However - about  6 weeks later and after tapering down from Breo to 100 - I began having extreme numbness in my limbs and tremors and bone pain and muscle pain.  I don't know if this is a coincidence or if I have something else going on but have notified my doctor and stopped taking Breo.  I am very concerned with the side effects I am having.  When I spoke with my doctor about this - she said she has never heard of the limb issues or joint issues etc. but there are plenty of stories about it here.,JanniePumps

I have had flu like symptoms, mood swings and every time I breathe in the right side of my ribs are in absolute agony, it's a horribly anxious provoking situation. I can't drive, because when I go over any bumps on the road my side hurts so so terribly, also been getting dry throat.

In the southeast I never had to use a bronchodilater. After moving to the midwest, my asthma worsened and was put on Breo.  Things were great in the first couple months.  However about a month and a half ago, I developed insomnia and a cough that I couldn't get rid of.  From there I caught a lung infection and then pneumonia.  When recovering from pneumonia I developed low potassium, severe bone and joint pain and headaches that won't go away.

40,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 4, 2019",32,"I caught a cold and it went from my head to my chest. Asthma flared up like crazy & between prednisone, proair, nebulizer treatments and Breo, I still couldn’t find relief.  You are only supposed to use LABA's until your symptoms are controlled, then you should switch back to steroid/other preventer. I was hyperventilating & honestly scared for my life. I couldn’t control my breathing. I've been hospitalized once but that was preventable (age9). Prednisone helps. I think Breo is a dangerous drug and should only be used for a couple months MAX. LABA's may reduce blood oxygen levels and cause adrenal suppression. Take vitamin d, calcium  & adrenal support. Breo worked wonderful when my advair (took from 9-23Yrs old) stopped working but my gut is telling me this medication is dangerous long term. Also, I’ve noticed chest pains on this medication.",Amy

42,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,5.0,,"August 16, 2019",20,"I started on the breo ellipta in April 2019. It was amazing, for the first time in 23 years I could breathe properly. Take bigger breathes in general and my asthma was gone. However, the side effects were huge. It gave me insomnia and so it changed my sleeping pattern (I usually go to bed at 8pm and wake at 5am), I have been constantly sick since May this year (I’m not kidding), I gained a hell of a lot of weight, my skin changed from super oily skin to completely dried out, I had a constant cough, my sinuses (which have never been an issue prior) were playing up constantly, mentally I did not feel like myself at all. My mum however hasn’t had as many side effects. It is such a shame that we have to choose between dealing with the above or not being able to breathe.

Couldn't believe I didn't need my rescue for months at time. Went thru 1 inhaler/month most of my life. Drawback of Breo is that it severely weakened my immune system. Started getting oral thrush every 2-3 months even after rinsing & gargling w/antiseptic. 2 years ago I started getting sick all the time. Last year had flu 2x, a respiratory infection and 3 stomach viruses. Took prednisone in January - I was told me to stop Breo because that was too much steroid. Haven't touched it since, & haven't gotten sick since. Also have anxiety and heart palpitations now, never had prior to using Breo. Now not smoking & not taking Breo in 7 months palpitations have lessened & anxiety  starting to get better. Feel better since stopping Breo.

About a month after I started this medication I had the first panic attack of my life, for a completely unthreatening stimulus (I was sitting in traffic). Over the next two years I continued to have panic attacks over very silly stimuli and constant anxiety/tension in my chest/neck area.After cutting out Flonase, caffeine, alcohol, birth control, and still having anxiety issues, it finally occurred to me that perhaps it was this medication.It has been one week since I went off the medication, with only my rescue inhaler for my asthma when I need it. I do feel the occasional slight shortness of breath, but I feel I can much better live with that than I could the side effects of Breo.

From the first day of use, I didn't have to rely on my rescue inhaler for the first time since age 8. Now, when the weather is bad - high pollution days or right before it rains, I might need my ventolin inhaler, but it is so infrequent, I haven't refilled my prescription in ages, and before the Breo I used to use one inhaler per month minimum. The biggest issue I've had is weight gain around my mid-section and I've gotten shorter. DEXA scan verified that my disk spaces have narrowed, but so far my bones are healthy. I was 5'9"" when I began the medication and am now 5'7 1/2"". I go to the gym 3 days a week and alternate between cardio and strength training, and cannot lose the weight. But at this point in my life, breathing without an inhaler in my pocket 24/7 is better than a little extra weight.",Breatheasy

56,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,10.0,,"April 8, 2019",13,"I have severe adult onset asthma, mostly irritant triggered. This is the first long acting bronchodilator that works for me. Others make me feel worse within 3 weeks. I have gone off Breo twice, but ended up back on. Observations on and off have been consistent. The first couple weeks after starting are very rough with lots of coughing and attacks, like it's clearing all the crud out of my lungs. After about 2 weeks I turn the corner and feel so much better. On Breo, rebounding from a significant irritant exposure that inflames my lungs is shortened to 3-5 days from 3-4 weeks without it! Rebounding from a bad attack is also much quicker and easier. Also, the good stretches feel so much better than before. I honestly didn't realize just how much it helped until the last time I went off. Within 3 months I couldn't take it anymore, as I couldn't believe how much of a difference it made.

At least 2 (probably 3) sinus infections and 2 bouts of Flu (with fever) since I started the Breo 6 months ago. All of these have come with a cough that I never used to have with a cold or flu. I know this because coughing worsened my asthma. I was always grateful to be sick without a cough. Two bouts of losing my voice as well. I can't say for certain it was the Breo that caused this bad Fall/Winter. Maybe all this doctors office time getting my asthma in check was just hard on my immune system?  Before the Breo I was a ""2 mild colds a year"" guy & something has definitely changed. The worst part? After about 4 months of not seeming to work, the last 6 - 8 weeks have been without most asthma symptoms. So it works I think, but is the cure worth the other symptoms?

Not just when I was around them but for at least a week after every exposure. This made my relationship with my dog loving in law's strained. Simply because I had to leave within an hour of a visit and take their daughter with me. In comes Breo , I saw the ad on TV for a free trial, asked the doctor, he said my insurance didn't cover it, told him about the coupon, he approved. Deep breathing. DEEP BREATHING! I SLEPT AT MY IN LAWS HOME FOR 3 DAYS. NO PROBLEM!!!! CON: you really have to wash your mouth out thoroughly after every use. I've had more canker sores/popped pimple in there than ever. Worth it.",Angelp123

103,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 18, 2016",17,I've been suffering with asthma for a few years now. I was diagnosed as an adult. Nothing would work for me. I was on so many different medications constantly switching things trying to get something to work. My allergist prescribed breo to me around a month ago. I haven't had any wheezing which is huge for me. No coughing. No shortness of breathe. No runny nose. I can actually sleep through the night. It's the first time in years that I've felt like my lungs can fully fill up with air. It's amazing. The only reason I'm giving it a 9 instead of a 10 is because it's caused me to have a constant sore throat. At first I thought I was getting sick but after 2 weeks with no other symptoms I looked it up and saw sore throat is pretty common.,hrpuff
104,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 17, 2016",23,"I was diagnosed with allergy induced asthma last year after suffering for many years.Was prescribe Breo Ellipta which worked almost instantly and totally resolved my symptoms. I was ecstatic as it was an absolute miracle drug and all my coughing and tight chest issues were gone!The very unfortunate downside was that I started with severe headaches which literally crippled me. I went off the Breo and the severe headaches stopped, but chesty issues have returned. GP has now put me onto Symbicort to see how that goes. Im so upset that the Breo didn't work out for me as it is truly effective. Would highly recommend it (and hopefully no headaches for you)",Jann.A

106,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 16, 2016",14,"After having asthma my whole life and trying EVERY treatment for it, herbal or otherwise, I thought I had found my miracle. But after a day or two, my throat started hurting and I thought I was getting sick. I am convinced it is The Breo. I would rather use my Albuterol rescue inhaler 3 to 4 times a day than feel like I can't swallow. I had an even worse experience with Symbicort. It made my breathing worse. Breo did work, so for the 1 week I used it for, no asthma attack ,no nebulizer or inhaler, so this is why I give it 7 stars. But I cannot put up with the sore throat. I don't even wanna eat.",Anonymous

I have been on Symbicort and Advair but still had to use my rescue inhaler several times on a daily basis. I started Breo Ellipta in October of last year, and have only had to use my rescue inhaler once, and that was the day after I started Breo. I absolutely love it, no more use of a rescue inhaler or nebulizer, and most important no side effects. We have horses and every time I would go out there with them it would make my Asthma flare up. I can now go out and spend the whole day right beside them with no problem. My doctor said this is the best he has ever heard my lungs sound. I would highly recommend it.",SaundraC

114,Breo Ellipta,Asthma,2.0,,"October 29, 2015",42,"I was changed to Breo almost 3 months ago, after being on Advair 100/50 for 14 years. My Dr changed it, because he felt that Breo would be less steroid in my body. Well, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" My breathing got worse, and it is a struggle to take a deep breath. I had to use my rescue inhaler 2-3 times a day, this past month, when with Advair, I'd only use it 1-2 times ayear. I constantly felt like someone was choking me, or that my lungs wouldn't inflate fully, & I'd have heart palpitations when I'd lay down, & would wake me from sleep. A recent CT scan showed bibasilar atelectasis, whereas another done prior to Breo this year, didn't show that finding. I started back on my Advair today. I hope it still works for me now.",Leilani Shannon
