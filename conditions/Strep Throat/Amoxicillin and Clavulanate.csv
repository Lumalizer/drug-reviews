0,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Strep Throat,8.0,,"November 26, 2021",0,"Awful pain on right side of throat, white bumps everywhere. Also couldn't eat much from pain. Loss of appetite not sure cause of the strep. Went to urgent care that night and got prescribed 500 MG amoxicillin twice a day.  By day 2 almost completely gone. That night I started having diarrhea. Nothing to major. But still loss of appetite. Could barely eat anything! Day 3 stopped at grocery store to get probitics. All day had severe diarrhea! Plus barely eating all day made it so much worse. Also having to bartend for happy hour. I felt awful. Also tmi but I do in fact have hemorrhoids so diarrhea all day really messed me up and by the last time I went to restroom it was bloody and I got freaked out. Left early. It's Thanksgiving day so I couldn't call my doctor but my insurance offers to speak with an MD and he told me to start taking one a day.  And nbot to worry my hemorrhoids were irritated from going all day. Still going to call my Dr in the am to be sure. Still have 7 days to go.",Anonymous
1,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Strep Throat,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 12, 2021",0,"Amox clav 875/125 worked great on my strep throat, but because it kills all bacteria, you have to take it correctly.  You need to take a probiotic 2 hrs after taking amox/clav or you will probably get a bad case of diarrhea. I researched this and  found that a good probiotic is one that is 1 billion active and at least 4 species of bacteria.  Check your health food store , refrigerator section. After  getting strep  twice in one month, I also found out my wife was a carrier    (asymptomatic) showed no signs or symptoms of having  strep.  So I would get medications, get cured and get strep again. If you are married or have a partner and you get strep, both of you need to get tested. If you don't, you could be passing the strep back and forth.  Only 1 in 10 adults get strep so your partner could be just a carrier.",Xman

WORST EXPERIENCE of my life. I've been extremely nauseous with stomach pain, some pepto took care of the discomfort easily enough, but that's not my main complaint. It has destroyed my sense of taste and smell, everything reeks, I can't make out any smells, everything has the same disgusting odor. There's a putrid bitter taste in my mouth all the time. I lost almost 10 lbs through my 10 days of this antibiotic simply because how little I could eat/ keep down. Granny smith apples and yogurt were the only things that didn't have that bitter putrid taste. Not to mention it took 7 days for my fever to break when the doctors told me 3-4.",JayT

I had hives all over my body that itched. It made me self conscious and depressed and I can't work right now because my job is labored and I sweat a lot.  The doctor didn't want to give me anything else because my immune system was freaking out.  A week and a half later my hives are spreading still and my strep comes back. I was given a steroid injection that helped relieve some of the itching, taking zyrtec daily, prednisone and keflex this time due to my other antibiotic allergy. 2 weeks since I stopped taking Augmentin and anything that causes me mental anguish or anxiety flare my whole body up with hives that feel like bugs are crawling over me..

I was sure to share my past episodes with the medication, but the ENT assured me headaches were not a side effect.

12,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Strep Throat,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 18, 2019",2,It seems to be effective against the strep infection. My low rating is due to the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE for me to swallow a chalky pill this huge. I made the mistake of not looking at the prescription (stapled in the sack) when I picked it up from the drive-through window. I would have definitely asked my pharmacist for something else had I known this was what the doctor ordered. I really hate ANY pill is made this large. Despite the recommendations not to crush it....I must to be able to swallow it. And I am sure a replacement would not be free. Too late to change now.,Jac

Zithromax or Z packs (azithromycin) are useless for me due to complete antibiotic resistance to that drug. Also, regular amoxicillin is ineffective due to antibiotic resistance. This medication is powerful and can cause side effects such as diarrhea but you can take Imodium (loperamide) for that which I highly recommend during the course of this treatment along with drinking plenty of fluids such as water and Gatorade to maintain electrolytes. This is a 10 day course of medication and is highly effective. I recommend this as a FIRST course of treatment due to antibiotic resistance.",Frank26

I had a round of Amoxicillin which didn't quite clear it, so I was prescribed Augmentin. I had 30 hours of travel ahead of me, and two hours of sleep to go on, but despite the circumstances, I began to feel much better! The only side effects I've had so far have been that the acne on my cheeks has completely cleared up and I have better than average energy levels (not sure if either of these are related to the Augmentin, but the timing lines up perfectly).",kat2332
