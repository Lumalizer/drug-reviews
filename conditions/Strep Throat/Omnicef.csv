2,Omnicef,Strep Throat,5.0,,"December 12, 2011",59,Omnicef worked but it took until the 5th day on it to finally feel a tiny bit better. I had some side effects and my throat hurt so bad I couldn't sleep for three nights. I saw no visual difference until the 9th day. It almost looked as if on my third day it had gotten worse.,Anonymous
