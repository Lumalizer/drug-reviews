0,Erythromycin,Strep Throat,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2019",6,"I was given erythromycin for both tonsillitis and urinary tract infection as I am allergic to penicillin.  I was fine after the first 6-8 hours, however when I went to bed I suffered with severed stomach pains, and severe vomiting and nausea. I continued to take it however it was becoming too severe so I discontinued and went back to ADOC (doctor on call). I do not recommend this medication it is truly horrible on the stomach.",Em1ly99
