2,Clarithromycin,Strep Throat,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 24, 2020",2,"The only thing I have to say about clarithromycin is awful. I have been on 500mg twice daily for the past 5 days and I need to stop. First couple of days I was absolutely fine with no side effects and then by day 3 I started getting chills, shaking, headaches, stomach cramps, low grade fever and tightness in my throat with wheezing. I continued onto day 5 not noticing that the tightness in my throat and wheezing was due to an allergic reaction from this drug! (I have asthma so put it down to having a bad episode) Before you take this drug ask for a skin test to see if you are allergic! I didn't even think I was as I have been on it before. Avoid it as much as possible, yes it is good at clearing infections but do your research and always ask for a better alternative.",CBAW

4,Clarithromycin,Strep Throat,1.0,,"April 2, 2020",10,"Where do I start? I had strep throat before and this time was worse, I was given these clarithromycin antibiotics as as stronger alternative to penicillin which had also made me vomit, I was in a bad way. A day or so after taking these, my mental health declined (I have an anxiety disorder, ocd and depression) nothing could have prepared me for the terror that my mind went through on these. Shaking, voices and sounds in my ears, intrusive and terrifying thoughts, anxiety and heart beat like I was going to have an attack, crying uncontrollablyI had to come stay with my parents for 5 days to get well as I was unable to care for my 18mo daughter as the side effects were so bad and also included headaches, nausea and the shakes. I thought I had truly lost my mind. It has been a Rollercoaster and not a good ride at all. I would ask anyone (especially if they have MH problems) to avoid these. I am glad I read other reviews and I am now reassured that it's not just me who encountered these ill affects.",Chloe M85
5,Clarithromycin,Strep Throat,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 4, 2020",8,Biaxin (clarithromycin):Biaxin is a drug that has saved my life several times over.   I can't understand the bad reviews.  It works very fast.  I have no metallic taste.  If there is a bit of an aftertaste I sip on some coke (soda) and its gone.  Less side effects than pennicillin or cephlosporins.  I have zero side effects with this medication.  My ENT dr. uses it for my strept on my tonsils.,Cheryl

7,Clarithromycin,Strep Throat,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 11, 2020",1,"Absolutely horrendous. Worst antibiotic I have ever tried. Was given 2x a day for 5 days for strep throat. Day 1, severe sickness, anxiety due to thinking I’m going to be sick every minute, found some anti sickness and felt a bit better. Day 2 cramps kicked in, agony and then unexpected diarrhoea several times. Day 3 and it’s the afternoon I feel absolutely miserable and the cramps are back to expect to spend the day on the toilet. Bright side strep has cleared up well but what are all these side effects about about, I feel worse than ever and have never had this with any antibiotic. I’m in 2 minds not to do the final 2 days. I will never accept this antibiotic again literally feel like I’m poisoning myself. The old antibiotic never did anything like this. Glad I’m not alone.",Coco

10,Clarithromycin,Strep Throat,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 21, 2018",2,The worst thing about this is that you get a terrible metallic bitter taste in your mouth. No matter what you do it stays there. It makes food even taste somewhat differently. I also always get small bumps on my chest every time I take it. The drug does work for me though and I’ve taken it for more than one thing. I’m allergic to penicillin so this is the closest related kind that I can take.,kal.
11,Clarithromycin,Strep Throat,1.0,,"May 31, 2018",0,"HORRIBLE. I tested positive for strep when I initially went in and had very few symptoms after 5 days on the medication my symptoms increased exponentially. I have had strep numerous times and this is the only time I had such situation happen. I ended up spending time in the ER because I needed to get on some EFFECTIVE meds immediately so I could continue going to work. And lets just say that was a process. All in all do not let your doctor prescribe you this for strep there are many other medications available. Just save yourself the time, stress, and money.",HiThere

This time, the Doc prescribed Clarithromycin 500mg x 2 per day. Quite a large tablet for a sore throat but they do go down easily. I am quite sensitive but these have been ok. Some sporadic diarrhoea but not too bad. Nasty taste in my mouth in the morning which is weird. Tingling skin on hands, again a  bit weird, but nothing too bad. Throat cleared up really quickly but I took full course as advised. Very pleased with the drug. Better than erythromycin that I am usually prescribed.",Orlando

I’ve got strep throat, something I’ve never heard of before, I’m 28 and suffered loads with my tonsils, this medication (tablets) I was cutting into 4 just to swallow and it was awful, had to go back and get the liquid form, I’ve been on it a week and feel LOADS better, it’s definitely working for me. Only downside is i the taste in my mouth isn’t nice by the morning lol. Like a poison taste! And taking my last dose (12 hours later) makes me sleep all night something I’ve struggled with for months as my thyroid is under active!

The pain was unbearable and a constant fever between 104 and 106 so I started taking Ibuprofen and it's gotten rid of the fever and made the throat pain manageable so that I can at least eat soup and get some sleep. Going back to the doctor in the morning if noting has changed because I can't keep eating Ibuprofen like it's candy.,Casey250

21,Clarithromycin,Strep Throat,9.0,,"February 4, 2017",9,"Worked great for a severe bronchitis infection that I thought would kill me. Only downside is this medication leaches potassium from your stores like 90,000 mgs each time you take so that's a lot. If you start experiencing leg cramps or heart palpitations this is why. Doctors should be giving you a course of potassium supplements each time along with these but surprisingly never do. I near took a heart attack coz was so low on potassium. This medication blocks off the potassium ion channel to the heart in the process of killing your infection so grand if your potassium is good but very dangerous if its not. Again it should be getting replaced when this is prescribed coz if you take it a few times your potassium will be gone from body.",Melicece

Outside of the terrible metallic taste that I experienced within 6 hours of taking the Clarithromycin, the medication works very well. After 24 hours of being on this medication my throat feels so much better, my dizziness has subsided, and I no longer feel extremely weak and fatigued. My stomach is a little upset but it is not unbearable. I would rather take a minor upset stomach and metallic taste in my mouth over the extreme throat pain and fatigue the strep caused. As far as insomnia I'm more of a night owl so I couldn't say if the medication has contributed to my restlessness. I think this medication is a great therapy for strep.",MoniBell

That was aside from the insomnia side effect I received in addition.It doesn't do anything for my Strep Throat either, Flagyl is much more effective than this at a lower dosage than Clarithromycin in even a 5 day course.I would seriously warn anyone who, like myself, cannot take penicillin based medications to seek out an alternate anti-biotic first.",Annabelle5276

The doctor also put me on a muscle relaxant to help reduce the throat swelling.  The first night dreamed  I was water skiing in a mall in Detroit!  Bizarre nightmares and a very listless sleep which I see now that I may have incorrectly attributed to the muscle relaxant. Now I think it`s the clarithromycin.  I don`t know about metal but it is a horrible taste.  I am tired, have sore muscles, ringing ears and no appetite and I love food!  I've only been on clarithromycin for three days.  My Rx is 500 mg twice a day for 10 days.  I can`t wait to get off this stuff.  I've never had such a bad experience with an antibiotic.",Sophie`s mom

BUT.....i had insomnia for three days and the metelllic taste too. MUCH worst was the weird thoughts and depression I got ( which I have no history of family or otherwise ). So, the upshot is to be guarded against using this drug. If you are armed with this information, you can influence your choice. I would strongly suggest use something else.

Really disgusting. The second night I was up with severe nausea in addition to the taste. Stopped after two days as it was making me feel sicker than the reason I was prescribe the drug (strep). Also throat did not improve much. Got an alternative antibiotic. Everyone may not have the same experience but mine was very negative.,Matty J

I am allergic to penicillin so I always get prescribed biaxin. It always clears up my infections, the only down side is the horrible bitter taste. My best advice besides chewing gum / mints in between is eat dark chocolate before & after - it actually does help subside the bitter taste! Also take the probiotic pearls with each dosage, it should help your stomach and prevent diarrhea. Eat as much yogurt as possible or drink Kefir milk -- kefir milk is the best probiotic you can take. It works wonders! You may get some minor headaches / stomach discomfort the first couple days, but let your body adjust and you should be fine.

For me I was glad to get rid of the pain so went with the side effects. Can't tolerate penicillin or erythromycin so don't have much choice!",Anonymous

I went to the doctor and he prescribed Biaxin. Ever since I started taking Biaxin I have been very sleepy during the day and restless sleep during the night, it has also left a really bitter taste in my mouth. I have been drinking so much water and going to the bathroom lots, but it doesn't seem to have made anything better. I will give it a few more days.",Anonymous
55,Clarithromycin,Strep Throat,8.0,,"April 26, 2011",16,Biaxin (clarithromycin):This is a fantastic medication for strep throat. Only downfall is the vaginal discomfort. I find taking a pro-biotic pill 2 times daily while on it prevents the discomfort.,Drywave

Symptoms: fast heart rate, headache, metallic taste, shaky on the inside, involuntary spasms, dizziness. I believe that the medicine would have worked if I did not experience the severe side effects.",Anonymous

58,Clarithromycin,Strep Throat,9.0,,"January 12, 2009",31,"Biaxin (clarithromycin):I've been prescribed this medication a few times now for my Strep throat. I am allergic to penicillin, and the little blue pills you take 4 times a day did not clear up my infection after the first time I used them. When I go into the doctor I now request Biaxin, even though it is a bit more expensive. The positives:Has always completely cleared up my infection. Easy to takeThe negatives:The metallic taste I also experiance ""vaginal discomfort"" When I am on this medication. It feels very similar to a yeast infection, and usually starts 2-3 days after I begin taking the medication. A little topical cream works fine to keep this under control, I use Canesten. Overall I would suggest this medication if others have not worked for you.",Gebe
