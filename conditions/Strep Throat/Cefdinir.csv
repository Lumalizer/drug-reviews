0,Cefdinir,Strep Throat,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 18, 2021",3,Had strep after taking 3 different antibiotics before Cefdinir which were unsuccessful. Cefdinir has taken til the 5th day to see any real results but no side effects were experienced. I recommend taking a probiotic 2 hours before or after each dose to avoid the negative GI issues that can come from any antibiotics.,Gjord
1,Cefdinir,Strep Throat,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2021",0,"I  was prescribed this yesterday after being diagnosed with strep.  I received two injections while I was in doctor's office, which I am so glad I did.  I took my first capsule last night, and right after this I experienced chest pain.  I waited, and the pain finally quit.  I really didn't think much about it.  This morning, I took my second capsule, and I had worse chest pain than the night before.  As I said before, I'm glad I got the two in-office shots because I can't take this medicine.",Ruth

Thankful for that.However, I developed horrible ear pain. Unsure if it was a side effect of this medication or something else entirely.

4,Cefdinir,Strep Throat,1.0,,"March 19, 2020",7,"Was prescribed this cefdinir for strep throat. The side effects are terrible. Worse than strep itself. Extreme fatigue, weakness, fogginess and stomach issues. Will not take this again.",JMac
5,Cefdinir,Strep Throat,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 10, 2020",4,"I have an episode of strep throat with severe pain on one side. Am allergic to penicillin, so doctor initially prescribed Azithromycin, which didn't knock out the strep infection. Was then prescribed Cefdinir.I was hopeful at first, after 3 days I felt slightly improved. Then after 5 days, I began experiencing unbearable headaches on the right side of my neck and severe neck pain. Unsure if this was a medication reaction or just the strep throat coming back. After 6 days doctor switched me to clindamycin. Fingers crossed this next antibiotic brings me some relief.Didn't clear infection.",AshtynRaye
6,Cefdinir,Strep Throat,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 8, 2020",2,"I’ve had strep throat for a little less than a week. Two days ago, doc prescribed Cefdinir. The good is that my throat itself feels better. The bad?  Nothing else does. The foggy stoned feeling that always accompanies the majority of my infections is still going super strong. I’m still rocking a 103* fever, my energy level hasn’t picked up one iota, and I can’t eat anything because I’m nauseous, and I’m partially nauseous because I can’t eat anything.  I’m cycling between chills and sweats in a way I can’t keep track of.  To me, cefdinir is minor league. Never will I go back to it for strep.",Coffenite

8,Cefdinir,Strep Throat,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 11, 2019",5,"I was prescribed cefdinir for a bout of strep throat I had going on in 2017.  I explained I was allergic to penicillin and that I am usually prescribed a zpack (I had strep throat numerous times growing up.) The doctor mentioned that the zpack wouldn’t be strong enough and that this would work.Whelp...it worked alright. After taking it twice daily  for 8 days of 10, I’ve been dealing with more GI issues than I had in the past that no doctor can seem to resolve. I’m in pain almost everyday and diagnosed proctitis which I can only assume was caused by or at least initiated by this drug. Always question your doctor, they are human and make mistakes. Please steer clear of this drug for your health. I wish I would have.",Anonymous
9,Cefdinir,Strep Throat,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 7, 2019",4,"Awful, awful experience with this drug cefdinir for strep throat. I had been sick for two weeks and my husband had tested positive for strep, so I decided to go to the doctor and he said might as well treat for strep. He prescribed Cefdinir 300 mg. I waited until the next day to start. 45 mins after taking the first dose I suddenly had a migraine (which i do sometimes get), but my stomach also started hurting. Both became so intense I decided I needed to lay down. I had chills and hot flashes and my vision started blurring and it felt as if I were on a boat. After an hour of taking the dosage, I threw up and felt slightly better. I then slept 5-6 hours and still woke up with a bit of a headache and stomach ache. I felt worse after taking this drug than I did suffering through two weeks of being sick.",AnnaSum
10,Cefdinir,Strep Throat,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 16, 2019",7,"After one day of having an incredibly sore throat I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with strep throat. Since I’m allergic to penicillin I was prescribed cefdinir. Got rid of strep in a matter of a few days but side effect was painful diarrhea. Before taking this medication this was not a symptom at all. Slowly I stopped taking the medication because the strep had vanished completely and the diarrhea was getting worse everyday. Now that I am completely off the antibiotic the diarrhea is worse than ever, I’m extremely nauseous, I feel like I have a fever and my head is killing me. As for my throat I feel like the strep could possibly be coming back but no definitive pain yet.  Worth it at first but side effects and mostly the afterwards side effects are worse than the original throat pain.",Anonymous

It is now 5 days later and have tomorrow’s dose left. Worked for me. I do not have much of an appetite though but that might not be due to the drug.",Betty
12,Cefdinir,Strep Throat,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 21, 2019",7,"Had strep and was prescribed a z-pack. Finished it and strep came  back right away. Went to urgent care this time was  prescribed Cefdinir. I am on day 5 out of 10. Throat still hurt until day 3 or 4 but not as bad as it did before the meds. Was tolerable. I didn’t need the lidocaine prescribed or Ibuprofen after day 2. Had an immediate result the night I started this. I could barely even swallow and hours after taking this felt slight relief. Day 5 was the first day I could say throat didn’t hurt. Side effects were gassy stomach, some mild nausea. Nothing really. Overall think it’s good. Feel drastically better.",Kk2233
13,Cefdinir,Strep Throat,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 9, 2018",6,"My son was prescribed this for strep throat. After a couple days of taking it he was doubled over with severe stomach pain. Then the diarrhea set in. I stopped giving it to him and took him back to the Dr.  to get a different medication. They asked us to bring a stool sample and when it was tested, concluded that he now had c-diff, on top of strep throat, caused by the antibiotic. I will never use this medication again.",Bear68
14,Cefdinir,Strep Throat,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2018",11,Do not give this to you kids. I repeat do not give this to your kids. When pediatrician prescribes this drug for you child ask her about the side effects or alternate medicine like amoxicillin or penicillin. This drug need to be banned. Please parents do your research before you give this to your child. Side effects are very severe. Not only your child will suffer because of this drug but you will suffer as well. I advise all the parents to be very careful with Cefdinir.,Aj

Don't listen to people who say don't listen to the people who gave 1 stars. Well obviously if you're educated in the medical field,  everybody reacts differently to medication.  Just because it works for you, doesn't mean it does for everyone else.  Everyone is not you.  My mother in law and I take the same antidepressants.  She doesn't gain weight and I do.  You understand what I'm saying?  So leave your opinions to yourself.  It's a hit and miss with everyone and different meds.",Mariavarkulla

I have a double ear infection, sinus infection, bronchitis, and there was the possibility of strep. So she decided to kill 4 birds with one stone.

I had fever, ear pain, & swollen tonsils so my doctor went ahead and prescribed this before the culture came back. The first day I had loose stools & nausea. This continued until the fifth day I had muscle pain that otc pain meds couldn't relieve. It was a struggle to walk to the bathroom. Pounding headache, sensitivity to light. Watery diarrhea, severe stomach cramps. Fever and body chills--my entire body was trembling & teeth were chattering. I've taken many antibiotics in the past & this is the first one that has given me trouble. I wish I had been prescribed amoxicillan, I tolerate it much better.",taylor48953
