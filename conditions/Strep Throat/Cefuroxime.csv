0,Cefuroxime,Strep Throat,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 11, 2021",0,I was prescribed cefuroxime to treat strep and a UTI. Throat felt better within a day UTI took like 3-4 days for all symptoms to go away. The pill for this is big though and it’s hard to swallow and if you don’t swallow it in the first gulp it is legit the absolute worst taste in your mouth I’ve ever experienced. It legit made me throw up from the taste.,Girl from West V
