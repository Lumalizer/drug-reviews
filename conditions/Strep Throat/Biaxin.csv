0,Biaxin,Strep Throat,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 4, 2020",8,Biaxin is a drug that has saved my life several times over.   I can't understand the bad reviews.  It works very fast.  I have no metallic taste.  If there is a bit of an aftertaste I sip on some coke (soda) and its gone.  Less side effects than pennicillin or cephlosporins.  I have zero side effects with this medication.  My ENT dr. uses it for my strept on my tonsils.,Cheryl
1,Biaxin,Strep Throat,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2019",2,"I took 500mg (5 doses) of amoxicilin and it did nothing literally and I was shivering with cold fever, felt like I would never heal. But then  after taking first dose of Biaxin I felt it working as my pain reduced and feeling less dizzy .  I would suggest Biaxin over amoxil",strep throat
2,Biaxin,Strep Throat,9,,"January 21, 2017",5,"Whenever I got sick from season flu or cold, I always had sore throat and cough, my Doctor will usually gave me this medicine (Biaxin) and I was told this a good medicine. It worked fast to clear your strep throat (Sore throat). A few hours after taking  this medicine it made me feel better. I love Biaxin instead Amoxin or other medicines.",Anonymous
3,Biaxin,Strep Throat,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 3, 2016",14,"Obviously no antibiotic is going to be easy but this is tolerable. I am allergic to penicillin so I always get prescribed biaxin. It always clears up my infections, the only down side is the horrible bitter taste. My best advice besides chewing gum / mints in between is eat dark chocolate before & after - it actually does help subside the bitter taste! Also take the probiotic pearls with each dosage, it should help your stomach and prevent diarrhea. Eat as much yogurt as possible or drink Kefir milk -- kefir milk is the best probiotic you can take. It works wonders! You may get some minor headaches / stomach discomfort the first couple days, but let your body adjust and you should be fine. Its definitely tolerable, compared to other meds.",Anonymous
4,Biaxin,Strep Throat,6,,"April 10, 2016",0,"Started taking this medication 3 days ago for strep, didn't even know I could still get strep after getting my tonsils out 15 years ago. I've been sick for just over a month and wasn't getting any better. I take absolutely no medications but I just couldn't take being sick anymore. The fever, chills, aches, are gone. Throat is still scratching if I talk to much, sinuses are still completely plugged and runny nose is still present. My Dr prescribed Biaxin for 10 days so fingers crossed this continues to work!",capegirl86
5,Biaxin,Strep Throat,1,,"December 17, 2015",6,"After taking one 500 mg. clarithromycin in about three hours became dizzy, uncomfortable in the head and short of breath.  Am afraid to take another although it was prescribed one every 12 hours. Have spent most of the day with head reclined and eyes closed.  Had same reaction to 500 mg.. of Azithromycin but could take 250 mg. with no problem.  Shall I ask the doctor to prescribe a smaller dose.  Am very fearful of another like this.",Mary Maxine
6,Biaxin,Strep Throat,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2013",12,I love this. I had a really bad strep throat and I tried everything I can so one day after I came back from a Cody Simpson signing (I couldn't miss that!) me and my mom walked to a doctor and he suggested Biaxin and after 1 dose I was feeling so much better it's been 4 days and I'm all better and I haven't had any side effects! The only sad thing that happens while I was taking this was a day after I got it I had to miss a Justin Bieber concert with my friend (she went) because my parents didn't know if the side effects would affect me.,Gabby:)
7,Biaxin,Strep Throat,6,,"February 14, 2013",23,"I have had this medication prescribed to me twice now. Both times within less than 24 hours of taking it I experienced the metallic taste in my mouth, nausea/vomiting, headache and the worst of all side effects, uncontrollable diarrhea. When I say this, it's not the ""let me run to the bathroom quick"" kind of diarrhea, it's the kind that if you're not within 5 feet to a washroom then you're basically out of luck. The medicine itself works really fast (my throat started feeling better after one dose) but there's no way that I can be on this medication and go to work for a full day....unless I take a few extra changes of clothes with me. I, unfortunately, seem to be experiencing the worst of the watery diarrhea symptoms associated with it.",NiNaft
8,Biaxin,Strep Throat,1,,"April 5, 2012",19,"Yesterday I woke up feeling very sick, I had a horrible sore throat, bad migraine and I felt like I was going to vomit. I went to the doctor and he prescribed Biaxin. Ever since I started taking Biaxin I have been very sleepy during the day and restless sleep during the night, it has also left a really bitter taste in my mouth. I have been drinking so much water and going to the bathroom lots, but it doesn't seem to have made anything better. I will give it a few more days.",Anonymous
9,Biaxin,Strep Throat,8,,"April 26, 2011",16,This is a fantastic medication for strep throat. Only downfall is the vaginal discomfort. I find taking a pro-biotic pill 2 times daily while on it prevents the discomfort.,Drywave
10,Biaxin,Strep Throat,1,,"January 24, 2011",17,"Allergic reaction after taking 2 x 500mg tablets. Symptoms: fast heart rate, headache, metallic taste, shaky on the inside, involuntary spasms, dizziness. I believe that the medicine would have worked if I did not experience the severe side effects.",Anonymous
11,Biaxin,Strep Throat,10,,"March 3, 2010",23,This is the BEST antibiotic on the market. I have taken it several times and I love it.. Works fast with NO side effects..... Love it,Anonymous
12,Biaxin,Strep Throat,9,,"January 12, 2009",31,"I've been prescribed this medication a few times now for my Strep throat. I am allergic to penicillin, and the little blue pills you take 4 times a day did not clear up my infection after the first time I used them. When I go into the doctor I now request Biaxin, even though it is a bit more expensive. The positives:Has always completely cleared up my infection. Easy to takeThe negatives:The metallic taste I also experiance ""vaginal discomfort"" When I am on this medication. It feels very similar to a yeast infection, and usually starts 2-3 days after I begin taking the medication. A little topical cream works fine to keep this under control, I use Canesten. Overall I would suggest this medication if others have not worked for you.",Gebe
