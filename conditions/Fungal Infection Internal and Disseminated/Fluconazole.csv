0,Fluconazole,Fungal Infection Internal and Disseminated,1,,"October 30, 2020",9,"Took this fluconazole for systemic  fungal infection. Took half the dose 50 mg and hours later I had a rash on my cheeks and felt like I was hit with he worst flu I’ve ever had. Extreme fatigue, chills, dizziness, nausea. Was asleep at night and woke up with an extreme panic attack and anxiety and I’m not an anxious person whatsoever and have had no issues prior with this. It felt like I was seriously not going to survive. I stopped taking it and 3 days later almost back to normal. I never write reviews but be careful with this stuff!",Sarah
