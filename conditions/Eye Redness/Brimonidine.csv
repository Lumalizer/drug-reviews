0,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 29, 2022",0,"Lumify (brimonidine):I used it once, around 6pm.  It worked great.  My bloodshot, red-rimmed, allergic eyes were almost immediately clear.  I was so happy.  My eyes felt so good.  Nothing else seemed to work before this.  I woke up at 6am with blurred vision.  It seemed to resolve 2-3 hours after that.  I cannot bring myself to try again.  What if that could become permanent?",angclan
1,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 9, 2022",0,"Lumify (brimonidine):At first, I was using Zaditor to cure my eye allergies and it did the trick, but I still have a little reddish part on my sclera and I had a date so I bought some Lumify because I've heard about it and how it works like magic and it will make your eyes white after a minute of instilling a drop. So I used this for about 3 days. First few days my eyes are really white and I was really happy with the product. Suddenly, when when I stopped the drops and I thought that Id return back to zaditor to completely cure my eye allergies, I noticed when I woke up in the morning that my whole right eye is completely red. As in the whole sclera was red. This product is amazing but please be careful and not use this everyday because it still has rebound redness just like any other red eye reliever drops. If you need it, use it but not safe for everyday use.",Real Experience
2,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 4, 2022",0,"Lumify (brimonidine):I was blown away by Lumify when I first used it, I’ve never seen my eyes so white before! I’ve been using it for 6-7 months now, but the side effects are so bad I have to stop. It worked great at first, but eyes began to be bloodshot unless I used it, & it began wearing off fast making it so I’d have to use it 1-3 times per day. My eyes are constantly red and burning now, I get relief if I put the drops in but then it wears off fast & burns a lot when it wears off. It burns a bit when they’re white too. Scary part is lately my vision has been SO blurry, when I’ve always had perfect vision. To the point where I can’t read the next street sign or the car license plate in front of me.  Going in to get my vision checked and hoping these damages aren’t going to be permanent. I didn’t realize this can happen from the eye drops, I would’ve stopped a long time ago. They MUST include some warning! Also when I began using Lumify, visine stopped working. Strange.",Kris

I had heard using any eye drops that ""get the red out"" can make it worse over time so I just lived with it.  I read lumify was different so I was excited to try.  Initially it worked great, I have never seen my eyes look so amazing!   However it was very short lived,  the redness came back and my eyes were so dry and scratchy and I got a horrible headache.

5,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 28, 2021",0,Lumify (brimonidine):Takes my red out and I even use a drop on top of my lid and below my eye because I have really thin skin there and it takes red out.

7,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 19, 2021",0,"Lumify (brimonidine):This product is wonderful!! I'm really quite surprised at all the negative reviews. My eye doctor gave me a sample of Lumify to try and now I'm hooked! I've used it almost daily for the past several months (on days when my eyes aren't as white as I'd like them to be). It instantly brightens the whites of my eyes and makes blinking feel smoother (if that makes sense).  It lasts about 6 hrs or so for me, but even then my eyes are still rather white so I'm ok with using it only once a day.  I have not experienced any of the issues described by other reviewers: burning, swelling, sleepiness, chest issues, headache, etc. I've had LASIK and have some halos at night. Lumify has not helped me with that as indicated by one reviewer. I do agree that it is on the spendy side, especially for the small amount you receive. I'm happy to shell out the cash because it works so well for me though.",Bye Bye Red

9,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,1.0,,"September 23, 2021",1,"Lumify (brimonidine):This was recommended by my eye doctor.  I used Lumify only one drop maybe once a week to go out.   Yesterday I applied one drop to each eye to go out.  About an hour later I noticed a subconjunctival hemorrhage in the outer corner of my right eye.   This morning my entire eye is bright red.  I looked up the side effects and this was listed as an infrequent side effect.  I have no other risk factors:   I didn't cough, sneeze, vomit, strain, rub, no foreign object, no hypertension, no diabetes, and take nothing that causes bleeding or bruising.  This should be taken off the market.",Lesson Learned

11,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,1.0,,"September 13, 2021",0,"Lumify (brimonidine):I just started using Lumify last week once a day when applying my make-up.  It did a great job whitening my eyes, but after several days of use I began experiencing, drowsiness with insomnia, head fog, and then eye watering.  I was afraid I had COVID,  but then it occurred to me that I had just started using Lumify so I googled side effects which lead me to leave this review.  I didn't think to research eye drops before using them, but I'm glad I did now so that I  know that they are what's causing my symptoms. I haven't used them for about 32 hours and I'm still feeling the side effects.  I hope by discontinuing use they will go away.",Marie

16,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 14, 2021",3,Lumify (brimonidine):I believe that this product is DANGEROUS to use. After the first few days of using it I began to experience black floaters in both my eyes. I blew it off as maybe something else like stressful situations but I discontinued using it just to make sure.  The floaters disappeared. About 10 days later I was going out of town for  a reunion and wanted to look my best. I used the Lumify for 2 days and not only did the floaters come back but I developed a nasty broken vessel in the corner of my eye that lasted for a week.  My doctor told me that he has had other patients that had BAD side effects from this product. I'd like to open a class action law suit against the company. My eyes have been extremely dry and red since.,Grandma Cloud
17,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,1.0,,"August 3, 2021",0,"Lumify (brimonidine):Lumify was tried in one eye on 3 separate  occasions. First in the left eye because there was a contact in the right eye. Immediately, the drops burned and the eye felt like it was scratched and vision was blurry for overnight. The next time, a drop was placed in the right eye with the same results. Went without contacts for a week thinking corneas were scratched. After the eyes felt normal again, a Lumify drop was placed in the left eye to see if there was a visible difference between the whites of each eye. Severe pain like acid drops were being used with blurred vision for four hours. Not until the third try were the effects related to the drops. These drops were not well tolerated.",Myra
18,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 31, 2021",0,"Lumify (brimonidine):I tried Lumify about a year ago and upon using started having floaters which I had never had before.  Had to go the eye Dr because I had no idea what was happening.  The only thing I was doing different was the Lumify I told her.  She said she didn't think that would cause floaters and it is something common that happens as we age.  The Dr gave me some steroid eye drops and eventually the floaters went away.  I also quit using the Lumify after the appointment.   I recently thought I would give Lumify one more try.  Maybe the eye Dr was right that it was just a coincidence the I got floaters when I started using Lumify.   Shortly after trying again,  after about a year,  I experienced worse floaters than what I had a year ago and really blurry, washed out vision.  It has to be the Lumify because it only happened once I started using it.  I hope this will go away like it did the first time upon discontinuing use.",CAT

Thrilled at first, then the eyes, sinus, fast heartbeats, an odd cough, then intestinal problems appeared, and a feeling of fast temper, which isn't my normal self.  At the Annual Well Care appt. last week, I mentioned these to the MD, at first she ran the regular medical tests, then I mentioned the eye drops.  First, she looked up the website, all good things stated, then to review other sites: She stated I had each of the harsh side effects.

So when I saw the commercial for lumify I was interested.  I thought it was too expensive at first, but suddenly there was a change to allow these to be paid for with FSA/HSA $. As with others, this product worked great at first. But over time, my eyes became dependent and I developed a tolerance to them until I had to use them several times a day. Now they look worse than they originally did and sometimes using them doesn't do anything at all for me. They also feel continuously dry, swollen and generally irritated. No other eye drops work anymore,  and now a year in, I finally read the reviews. Wondering if/when my eyes will ever return to normal... DON'T FALL FOR THIS TRAP.",Caitlincliff1
23,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 28, 2021",2,"Lumify (brimonidine):I see an ophthalmologist twice a year and I am diagnosed with Blepharitis (inflammation of the eye lids).  With the combination of eye lid scrubs with Lumify in the AM and refresh eye drops at night, my eyes feel more like normal and relieved from the burning, puffy red eyes I always have when I wake up.  Lumify makes my eyes feel so much better by reducing my inflammation and redness.  The low-dose ingredients are safer for your eyes then the harmful ingredients that you will find in other red eye drops. I’ve been using this product for about 5 months and will continue.  I took two points off of a 10 star rating because the results are not long term but when my year round allergies are at their worst, Lumify came in for the save...  allowing me to open those red puffy eyes in less than 60 seconds to whiter, less puffy eyes.",mindylee81
24,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 26, 2021",13,"Lumify (brimonidine):First time, worked well, but noticed blurry vision and pupils would not dilate. Took eight hours for effects to wear off. Next morning, woke up with subconjunctival hemorrhaging in both eyes, soreness (like a bruise), inflammation, and headache. Thought maybe it was a one-off reaction so set aside for later trial. Last night, used as I had done the time before, but  it burned this time. Dismissed as due to dry eye because Restasis burns badly if eyes are dry. Again, vision became blurry, pupils would not dilate, and eyes were highly irritated. This morning woke up with feeling of being punched in the eyeballs. Again, subconjunctival hemorrhages, inflammation that looked like globs of petroleum jelly in each eye, same kind of headache. Threw away and began search for drug information and similar testimonies. Wonder if product was tested extensively enough. Seems these adverse reactions are not that uncommon.

It’s totally scandalous and I’m not sure how they (the makers) get away with this.On another note, I was amazed at how quickly my eyes whitened when using the product (about a year now) but now using it for this length of time it seems like the drops are making my red eyes worse.  I definitely have to use more than one drop to get the red out and the effect doesn’t last long at all anymore.

She says! Took this product home. Put one drop in each eye. Things seem fine. Slept for about eight hours. When I woke the next day I was nearly blind. I could only see colors and vague shapes. But the world was a complete fog. I went to the hospital that moment.  My eyes had a severe reaction to Lumify.Luckily after about two days and an outrageously expensive ER vist. And the horror of going blind. My vision slowly returned. I would not wish this on my worst enemy.  Please check with your doctor before using such products and make sure you do not try this product on a weekend for it is very difficult to find eye doctors to reverse the reaction or repair your vision when affected by Lumify.

My night vision is a mass of streaks and starbursts which get worse as my pupil dilates, and has caused me a lot of distress.

I tried this early on - it made my pupils very tiny, the whites very white, but also made my eyes very dry and sore - not nice to use. Because Lumify is weaker, it doesn't have these side effects, but it constricts my pupils enough to make a big difference to my vision.Now I'm puzzled because I've read the clinical trial research papers which say that Lumify has no ""significant"" effect on pupil size.

Not only does the redness completely disappear but also my eyes feel better! Been using for about 2 months now and don’t know how I would love without it! Highly recommend!,CC
103,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 23, 2019",15,"Lumify (brimonidine):It worked in an instant. Amazing! But then a couple hours later, my eyes were itching and I was dizzy and bright light bothered me at computer. This lasted a couple hours. My eyes were a little swollen and then stayed itchy for two days. So if you want to be like Cinderella and have gorgeous white eyeballs for about 2 hours, be prepared to leave the ball in a hurry when time is up and then pay the price. I hope I never need the full strength used by glaucoma patients!",Deb

I’ve never had so much pain in my eyes, it was like having someone punching them from inside. I was pretty scared, the pain lasted for 2 hours. I tried to rinse them and nothing changed. I couldn’t watch anything, that would increase the pain. I tried it because of the commercial, I wanted brighter eyes.",Momonella

108,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 15, 2019",14,"Lumify (brimonidine):Holy cow! I am in my early sixties, and have chronic red eye but try not to use too many drops. Decided to try Lumify just once, for a special occasion, where I wanted to look good in pictures. OH WOW! I have never seen my eyes this immediately bright white before; nothing like when I have used Visine or similar. It was almost unnatural and eerie, snow white, but my eyes looked YEARS younger, and the pictures were perfect. I'm just concerned that something that works this way is likely not healthy. Will run it by my eye doctor before using it again, and definitely will only use on a rare occasion.",momzilla
109,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 14, 2019",18,Lumify (brimonidine):I’ve been using these drops for a few months now and although they do whiten my eyes I now can’t see out of one of my eyes. My retina is so badly swollen and my vision is gone in that eye I don’t know if I’ll get it back. I’m now on steroid drops to try to get the swelling down and see if my vision comes back. Don’t use this product it’s not worth losing your vision!,Blind in one rye
110,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 12, 2019",11,Lumify (brimonidine):Same effect as Visine but 1 major difference. I normally use Visine.  I put Visine in one eye and Lumify in the other for comparison. No difference noticed. Both took redness out and moisturized with Visine giving slightly better moisture. Sooo I went on Vacation and packed both Visine and Lumify. One morning I used Lumify and then later before dinner i used Visine. Major mistake! The interaction caused MAJOR redness even though it was 10 hours between applications. The redness will not subside till at least 8 hours later. So warning stick with one. I will stick with Original Visine. Great results and price.,Keep it Real
111,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 7, 2019",13,"Lumify (brimonidine):This really does make my eyes white . At first I thought the only problem was there is very little drops in the bottle . After about three weeks of using a couple times a week my vision is very blurred and had to buy reading glasses . Had already bought new bottle .So tried using it again my eyes  started burning and watering . The blurred vision has not gone away and I have discontinued using product , It does make your eyes very white but for me the side affects are just too great . Hope my vision gets better soon.",holly

These make such a difference in the comfort of my eyes. They don't feel or look strained. My eyes are clear and bright beyond 8 hours. I would have happily given them a 10 but they are So expensive.,tuf2beme

However, I all of a sudden developed severely dry eyes and burning sensation. I couldn't get an eye appointment and now even though I stopped the Lumify my eyes are red, broken blood vessels, and burn ALL DAY LONG! Now the eye specialist is saying I have Blepharitis (blocked glands in eyes). I may not be able to wear contact lenses anymore-miserable.",Anonymous

They did make the whites of my eyes very white and cleared up the redness.  However, about an hour later my eyes kept watering and tearing up a lot.  Almost like I was having allergy issues, but I take an allergy medicine, so it had to be from the eye drops.  Sadly, I would not use these again because my eyes watered so much that it was smearing all my eye makeup.",Quietspirit1970

We received a sample of Lumify in the mail and I decided to try it out one Friday while getting ready to attend an outside wedding. After applying Lumify in each eye, I immediately had an itchy nose. On the car ride to the wedding I wanted to itch the inside of my nose like crazy! This continued throughout the night. Next day, my left eye duct was clogged , red and swollen . I am beyond upset! Do another use this product ! I will be seeing my doctor tomorrow .",JMont18

120,Brimonidine,Eye Redness,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 30, 2018",14,"Lumify (brimonidine):Chronic, dry/red eye sufferer. At first, these drops seemed miraculous. Nothing ever helped so I thought they were a gift from God. I used very sparingly, maybe 6 drops total in about 1 year. Recently used 1-2 times a week for the last 3 weeks. I have never in my life life looked so horrendous after doing this.  Lasts for 6 hours but I look like a monster the next day. The rebound redness is horrific. I’m afraid I’ve done permanent damage after reading reviews on mirvaso- the rosacea cream that has this ingredient to help flushing. Can’t believe they used this ingredient for eyes after the awful damage and complaints on  the face cream. PLEASE, be careful. This stuff ended up being POISON. I was so hopeful & now terrified. I can NOT get this redness back to normal now.",KaysMom

My vision prior to using Lumify was 20/15. Now it's 20/80. I visited my Ophthalmologist almost two weeks ago to be treated for the blurred vision and am now on steroid eye drops. The condition hasn't much improved. Please carefully read the side effects before using this product.,amadan
