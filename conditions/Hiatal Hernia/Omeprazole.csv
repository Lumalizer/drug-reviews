0,Omeprazole,Hiatal Hernia,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 22, 2022",4,"I have a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia. Omeprazole has been a god send for me. It stops the stomach area under the bottom of my rib cage from hurting; it stops Gerd, it also helps with irritation in my stomach. It works better than anything I have been prescribed (or bought over the counter.)",weygirl

2,Omeprazole,Hiatal Hernia,1,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 5, 2022",1,"Been taking this now for 34 years symptom and now a lot worse and I have just been told to increase med. This has not worked in constant pain, struggling to eat but due to COVID not able to get any help!",Anonymous
3,Omeprazole,Hiatal Hernia,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 9, 2021",5,Was worse off. Doctors were surprised that it caused depression and pain.  Subsequent review by other doctor identified that omeprazole depletes the magnesium levels and as a result one may  experience depression. Since I've stopped taking it I do not feel that way. I now take digestive drops which help with the reflux.  I understand that as we age our bodies may produce less acid which may lead to some of the same ailments. Digestive drops are to produce acid for digestion. I am pretty ok now but still have the hernia pain not indigestion,Sindy

5,Omeprazole,Hiatal Hernia,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 25, 2021",11,"I went for an endoscopy because I have trouble swallowing. I have had this condition before and have had my esophagus stretched, no problem. This time however, I'm told I have a hiatal hernia and reflux. Mind you, other than swallowing, I have NEVER had any symptoms of reflux. No heartburn, nothing. Dr put me on this omeprazole 20mg. Very first day taking it, guess what.. I NOW have symptoms of reflux. Throat feels like it's closing, chest tight, heartburn, and it feels like food is backed up to my throat. Not a good feeling! Is it the drug, or am I having a great attack? I took it the next day and the same thing. Day 3, I did not take it, but STILL same symptoms. Today is day 4, symptoms are fading.. I'm NOT taking this anymore..I don't see anyone else here with this issue.  Need to call Dr Monday..",Refluxy
6,Omeprazole,Hiatal Hernia,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 4, 2021",13,"I honestly surprised how many people here are battling with depression and anxiety because of this medication. I got to say I've been on this for a month and I totally saw the difference for the better, yesterday had my last tablet and today I'm feeling the difference of the acid again. I totally believe that people who are suffering these side effects have been battling them for years now and for some reason this medicine amplified them.",JesAcun

I have lost 7 months of my life to this drug, I was at a loose end and wanted everything to be over!! I went from a man enjoying his life to a severely depressed and unhappy person.

I stopped the Omeprazole 4 days ago and wow I feel like a new man back to my old self! No depression, no anxiety... WOW!! Please avoid this awful drug at all costs!!!",toby b
8,Omeprazole,Hiatal Hernia,2,,"January 12, 2021",14,omeprazole does not work for Hiatal Hernia. I’ve tried them all (except for Protonix).  The only one that works for me is Aciphex (rabeprazole).,Anonymous
9,Omeprazole,Hiatal Hernia,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 28, 2020",32,"I was taking Ranitidine (zantac) twice a day until I heard bad news about it. Now I'm on 20mg Omeprazole once a day. I have been on it about 7 months.     Very hard to pin point exactly how it helps except one area. That is the burning in my stomach is not as bad. I still have a lot of belching. Also a feeling of something stuck in my throat at times followed by coughing. And a shortness of breath. All seems to be tied to same problem, hiatal hernia.      But for sure hardly no burning feeling in stomach and no flaring up of my ulcer. The hardest thing for me to deal with is how well my meds are working on their intended targets because I take 14 diff ones!!      Bottom line, for sure Omeprazole does help my stomach area, acid, etc...",JJ
