0,Lansoprazole,Hiatal Hernia,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 17, 2021",4,"I have been taken Lansoprazole 15mg for more than a year now because I was getting a lot of acid reflux which was causing awful stomach pains and vomiting which would go on all through the night and made me lose a lot of weight too.   I went to emergency and had loads of different tests to see why this was happening and they said I had a case of Hiatal Hernia.Well, since I have been taking it it has got better, but I have been getting a lot of flare ups stomach pains/ vomiting on odd days again!! So feeling fed up with it all to be honest and its wearing me down..wondering if anybody else has been like me is 15mg enough? Do you think I should have a higher dosage?  I'm to frightened to eat anything and if I do eat I am always thinking will I be poorly in a few hours!!",Elz
1,Lansoprazole,Hiatal Hernia,4.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 26, 2021",5,"Been on Lanzo for three years, stopped the acid reflux but gives me major joint pain, dry eyes at night and bloating. GP not interested as he just wants to up medication.My other worry is the calcium deficiency it apparently causes which I can't get them to answer.Why not surgery? Because it costs money I assume it's cheaper to throw tablets across a table .",Jonni
