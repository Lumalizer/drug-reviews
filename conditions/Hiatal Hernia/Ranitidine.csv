0,Ranitidine,Hiatal Hernia,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 21, 2019",6,"This medication works well for me, if I take the prescription strength twice a day, everyday.  Unlike many drugs in the same class, Zantac provides relief within thirty minutes to an hour.  This, thus far, has worked for me.  Please consult your medical provider for a treatment designed for you.",DrLeigh

After two tablets of Ranitidine I started to get stomach pain, reflux, gas, dizziness, a headache and slight nausea. I have persevered for three days but not sure I can go on like this.
