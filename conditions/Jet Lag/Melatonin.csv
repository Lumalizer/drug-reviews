My jetlag has been really bad for days and of my friends had melatonin pills with him. The effect is fast and stronger then a sleeping pill. How can that be possible ? It could be a dangerous thing and becoming a addiction on people. I did it 3 times. And I felt super depressed the next mornings.  So I guess something is not right when people are saying.... OH NO WORRIES MELATONIN IS IN YOUR BODY ALREADY. IT IS NOT DANGEROUS.",VLEberlin
