0,Kenalog-40,Bursitis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 1, 2019",20,"Have had sciatica/spinal stenosis and herniated discs on MRI. Constant pain, felt like lightning in my left leg, tingling all the time and felt like hot liquid running down my leg. Seen Ortho doctor and he suggested kenalog injections to treat what he thought was bursisis in the hip and also sciatica. Went on a Tuesday and got 2 injections in the hip/butt area. Was pain free since the injections. Have small amounts of tingling below the knee if I overdue things. Friday was the first time in years that I could actually walk through the grocery store and not have to leave due to unbearable pain. This drug is just amazing to me. I have had no side effects from the injection. Only been 5 days but hopefully it will last for awhile and that I can avoid surgery. I feel so thankful. I highly recommend anyone trying Kenalog, it seems like a blessing for me.",Sally1289
1,Kenalog-40,Bursitis,1,,"May 17, 2018",50,"Since getting Kenalog-40 injection for hip bursitis a little under 2 months ago I've had worsening symptoms and they are awful.First I developed terrible acid reflux that left a constant burning in my throat then I developed gastritis. I had no appetite and couldn't eat, also diarrhea for weeks and lost 15 pounds in 3 weeks. Anxiety started shortly after the throat burning and hot and cold sweats, racing heart, lightheaded, it's all gotten worse as the weeks have gone by. I have horrible insomnia, racing heart sometimes palpitations my vision is blurred I have terrible anxiety and now some depression. I can't even drive now I feel so out if it most of the time. And it is affecting me cognitively, I have trouble focusing and making decisions.Oh and my hair is falling out in clumps.I've had every test possible by my dr and everything is normal. Kenalog-40 injection has ruined my life. And I have no idea how long it will last. I'm terrified.",Lost
