0,Prednisone,Bursitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 18, 2021",0,"Accrue hip bursitis. RXâ€™d two 40mg prednisone 2 days, 40mg 2 days, 20mg 2 days. Initial dose helped. After that, no relief, continued pain.",Tcurr5
1,Prednisone,Bursitis,1.0,,"February 3, 2021",7,"I took a 6 day course of Prednisone last week, due to severe bursitis in my hip. I've taken it fine in the past, no problem. This time was awful. Two years ago, I had the tail of my pancreas and my spleen removed. My immunity is low, and the stump of my pancreas leaks. I took the prednisone anyways.Within a day, it caused my heart rate and BP to go up and my blood to stop clotting. I couldn't stop crying, and became suicidal. I developed a yeast infection, cold sores, and a mild case of shingles (a sign of impending sepsis). Then came the diarrhea - while I was sleeping.It set off the most serious pancreatic attack I've ever had, after 14 years! Pure acid! (Acid caused me to have a splenic artery aneurysm last year) I had to sleep on my right side, because I was terrified the acid would eat through my spinal column if I slept on my back.If you have immune issues or pancreatic issues, you might want to steer clear. Awful stuff.",vedawms
2,Prednisone,Bursitis,10.0,,"October 15, 2020",14,I've used prednisone twice for bursitis pain in my left hip. Both times the response has been almost immediate- within 5 hours I felt like a new man. The effect seems to last about 4-5 weeks. My only regret is that my Ortho will only prescribe it about 2 times her year.,newhipper
3,Prednisone,Bursitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 28, 2020",6,"Horrific hip, knee and ankle pain from hip bursitis. Took 40mg prednisone 7 hours ago with no relief. 40mg again tomorrow and then cutting back. The pain is excruciating. Hope it starts kicking in SOON!!",Lucielle
4,Prednisone,Bursitis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 6, 2020",8,"My experience is long. I've been waiting for a rheumatology consult for an inflammatory condition. My GP is prescribing for me in the meantime. At this time I am suffering bursitis in my left buttock, ankle and heel as well as in my right knee, ankle and heel. I've been taking 30mg prednisone for weeks. I had good results at first and tapered down to 10mg when I experienced another flare and brought the dose up to 20mg and eventually 30mg. where I am now. My bursitis is not in check even at this dose but I do think it could be even worse without it. I barely am able to walk using two sticks. Fingers crossed I'll get an appointment with a specialist before Oct.",jojobe

7,Prednisone,Bursitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 25, 2018",39,"Hip bursitis 6 weeks with pain in hip area, running down thigh, involved knee, entire calf and foot/toes at times.  Ibuprofen and prescribed Robaxin helped about ten percent; leg continued to ache, with me limping and leg nearly giving out at times. Yesterday doc injected long-acting prednisone mixed with numbing agent lidocaine into hip bursa.  It is 18 hours later and I am nearly painfree!! The lidocaine works first, quickly, then prednisone slowly provides strong anti-inflammatory effects. The shot was virtually painless...I would recommend this treatment modality to anyone who is not allergic to these meds. So much relief!!",Loupn
8,Prednisone,Bursitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 23, 2018",41,"As a nurse, I can tell you that oral cortisone should be taken early in the day (and with food, of course) to avoid it interfering with normal sleep patterns. I would suggest taking it with breakfast. And as you probably know, it is not advisable to take cortisone for longer than two weeks (on a tapering dose) in order to avoid side effects.",elizannj

13,Prednisone,Bursitis,9.0,,"January 3, 2012",60,"I had elbow bursitis so bad, I could not sleep, move my arm. Missed work etc. Tried Advil, naproxen and tylenol and codeine.  Prednisone is the only thing that works and started working within 6 hours.  Took it for 7 days and my arm felt so much better. After I went off, it slowly came back but not quite as bad.  Took it for another 7 days and it healed 90 percent.",Anonymous
14,Prednisone,Bursitis,7.0,,"April 19, 2009",82,"Meticorten (prednisone):I have only been on this medication for 3 days for bursitis in my hip. I have noticed a little relief from the worst pain but I still am feeling stiff and hurt quite a bit. **NOTE: I have had insomnia since the day I started taking this medication. I slept only 30 minutes last night. Each night I have slept less. I was able to sleep 3 hours the 2nd night. I believe it is from this medication as the other medication I am on does not report insomnia as a side effect. At this point, I only have to take the medication for one week and if it helps with my pain, I feel it will be worth it but be aware that this might happen.",aha2009
