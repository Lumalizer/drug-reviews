0,Naproxen,Bursitis,5,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 8, 2021",3,"I have extreme pain from bursitis in my hips, especially at night. Naproxen alone has not been very effective for me.  Aspercream in combination with the naproxen has offered some slight relief when it wakes me up.  Because I also have arthritis in my back Iâ€™ve tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen with very minimal relief.  Ibuprophen is probably most affective but I avoid taking ibuprofen long term.",NanaJ

2,Naproxen,Bursitis,7,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 1, 2015",37,I was prescribed Naproxen 500mg for my bursitis behind my knees in both legs. I am a college athlete and was having many problems performing at the necessary level with the pain in my legs--Naproxen helped immensely. Felt very nauseous if I did not take this medication on a full stomach!,Anonymous
