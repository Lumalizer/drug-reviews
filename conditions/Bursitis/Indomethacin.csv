0,Indomethacin,Bursitis,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 12, 2018",6,"I use this drug mainly for back pain and sometimes arthritis, I think I have bursitis and I took this along with a Tramadol 50 and was amazed at how it made the pain almost disappear.  Indomethacin is a very old drug, has been around for a long time and sometimes does hurt your stomach but I haven't had that problem and I wish more doctors would prescribe it, just b/c it's old doesn't mean it doesn't work...just like the rest of us lol.",Baloney
1,Indomethacin,Bursitis,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2016",6,"Indocin (indomethacin):Got some notable relief from bursitis pain in the shoulder but side effects became unbearable an hour after each dose. Lightheadedness upon standing, fatigue, abdominal nausea and cramping. Dr. changed to Prednisone 20mg with immediate results and no side effects.",Anonymous
2,Indomethacin,Bursitis,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 22, 2013",6,I was diagnosed with Bursitis 2 days ago. I have never heard of this medication until then. All I can say is I am so impressed by this medication. My pain has diminished greatly! I did get the lightheadedness and a little of an upset stomach but that is all. I definitely would recommend it to anyone.  I was thrown off by the side effects at first but I'm very glad I gave this medicine a chance. Just remember to eat with it. It was very cheap too. I have Vicoden along with it.,texaswife
