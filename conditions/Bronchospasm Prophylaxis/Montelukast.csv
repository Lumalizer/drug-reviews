1,Montelukast,Bronchospasm Prophylaxis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 28, 2021",0,"At night I had severe breathing problems and was not able to fall asleep. I became addicted to Benadryl, it was the only medication that helped. My doctor advised me that taking Benadryl long term I would have severe adverse reactions so he prescribed me Montelukast and it worked! I'm able to breathe and relax and night and falling asleep is not an issue anymore.",Jim
2,Montelukast,Bronchospasm Prophylaxis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 4, 2021",0,"Ok I have been to so many Doctors over the 32 years of this chronic cough that I have every single day.  I’m at the end of my rope with this cough. Doctor asked me if I had a post nasal drip. I said  Yes  He prescribed Singulair. I have been taking it once a night for 9 days. I’m not sure if I would really notice any of the effects spoken of here.  Cause I do anyway suffer from anxiety, panic attacks and pretty bad temper. I will say that it took like five days and I’m starting to feel a difference in my coughing. It’s not as aggressive and does seem to be getting better.  I don’t think I will get over it completely cause I’m sure it’s become Chronic, but I can live with this mild cough..",Maggie
3,Montelukast,Bronchospasm Prophylaxis,1.0,,"May 25, 2020",10,"Singulair was helping my breathing while I was continuing using it but I wasn’t ok at all, and I just figured out that around 15 days since last dosage after 7-8 months of using 10 mg, I had hard breathing, headache, Feeling nausea, insomnia, sleepless, shaking, and a rapid of fast heartbeat but the big problem was my the mental issue, so mood changed negatively and has depression and anxiety. However, after the hard time visiting many doctors to find the problems, I found that after reading people experiences over multiple websites it’s the singulair plus it returned me back to past around 5-6 months ago when I was stopped taking it, I remembered I been to emergency had several side effects till I took it again once a day before sleeping. I am not Recovered a 100% but for sure I will be ok very soon since I quit turkey taking this pill and I hope everyone is ok. Please ask a qualified doctor before use it and make sure to know the side effects and when to use and stop.",Tom
4,Montelukast,Bronchospasm Prophylaxis,9.0,,"March 15, 2020",11,I was prescribed Montelukast by my PCP to prevent bronchospasms as well as asthma that I’ve now developed in my 50’s. I didn’t have any side effects. I was surprised with the reviews so It effects people differently. It has helped me tremendously I notice the difference. I don’t take it in the morning though I take it at night.,BEM
5,Montelukast,Bronchospasm Prophylaxis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2020",9,"My 6-year-old was given this to help with cough and cold like symptoms. I advise all parents to read reviews before giving this to your baby!! I know all children react to things differently but this medicine is bad news! My baby's mental state flipped completely. She has cried nearly nonstop for 2 days. She can't sleep, can't eat, and can't focus properly. She cried for 2 hours this morning, and every time I would hold her and ask what was wrong, she would just say ""momma I don't feel okay."" Her eyes are so weak she cannot keep them open. I looked up reviews and side effects to both the meds her doctor put her on when I stumbled on all the bad reviews on this. She has been on this montelukast for less than a week but I was advised to take her off of it already. PLEASE CHECK ALL SIDE EFFECTS AND REVIEWS BEFORE GIVING THESE TYPES OF MEDS TO YOUR CHILD!",Ginger_momma454
6,Montelukast,Bronchospasm Prophylaxis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 23, 2018",10,"Montelukast is pretty effective at blocking your histamine reaction to pollen and other allergens.  I must say, it works.  However, if you read the information that comes with Montelukast from your pharmacist, you will see many different side effects.  One of these side effects is DEPRESSION.I ignored this for some weeks, but after viewing a sad incident (not related to me), I became depressed.  Ordinarily, seeing that incident would have disturbed me, but I would get over it and bounce back.  But my sadness has lingered on, and I blame the Montelukast.  Be aware of any sadness or depression with this drug.Also, for allergies, I recommend a natural product which contains Quercetin among other herbs.This stuff is amazing.  At first take 2 caps twice a day and you can go to 1 cap twice a day.  Even asthmaticshave praised this product on Amazon.  Sudafed and 1 Claritin a day can be taken with the Breathe.  Best wishes to you all",Ann Wilson
