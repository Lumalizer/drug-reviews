0,Salbutamol,Bronchospasm Prophylaxis,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 19, 2021",1,"Becomes habit forming for me where I have to continue taking it. I take it for an asthma attack and then need to make sure it is around all the time because as it starts to wear off I need it again or I feel like I can't breath. Pure junk will not use it I switched to over the counter Primatene and do not have this issue, nor do I have to rely on a doctor.",Mike
1,Salbutamol,Bronchospasm Prophylaxis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 2, 2020",4,"Albuterol ( The medication) not the damn inhaler; which I heard does clog but mine never has. Anyway, Albuterol, the medication, works in about 1-5 minutes for me. My asthma symptoms get triggered when I work out, laugh too hard or during high pollen/bad air quality days. Albuterol is great, it's effective and It has saved my life more than a handful of times. I recommend for anyone who suffers from shortness of breath, bronchitis or any type of asthma.",Melicio
2,Salbutamol,Bronchospasm Prophylaxis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 14, 2019",8,"ProAir RespiClick (albuterol):This inhaler is not effective for someone who can't get air into their lungs. The way it works is by sucking the medicine out of the inhaler, and for those who barely have lung function there's no way to get the medication into your lungs so you CAN BREATHE. I almost passed out today trying to get this thing to work for me, but luckily I found an old ACTUAL inhaler that saved me.",CH

After two months of this not working,  I got a refill.  The second one worked.  The first one did not.  I called 1-888-482-9522.  This is their complaint line.

7,Salbutamol,Bronchospasm Prophylaxis,5.0,,"August 3, 2011",8,My doctor put me on this because I have sleep apnea and have trouble breathing when I go to sleep.  Because of my extreme weight loss I have been able to lower my CPAP pressure to the lowest setting and I use my inhaler each night before bed to help my breathing to be able to fall asleep.  I doesn't help though if I'm already short of breath.  I have no side effects and have been using it for 3 years.,tdl86
