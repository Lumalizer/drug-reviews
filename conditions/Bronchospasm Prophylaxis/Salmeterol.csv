0,Salmeterol,Bronchospasm Prophylaxis,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 8, 2018",2,"Serevent Diskus (salmeterol):I have had Asthma since very young. Until I started using Serevent, I had some type of bronchitis, or pneumonia every 2 months and was constantly on antibiotics. Since using Serevent, regularly, I may have one episode a year of bronchitis, Upper Respiratory or pneumonia. To me Serevent has been a life saver and life changer. Just wish they would come out with a Generic.",Kimh
