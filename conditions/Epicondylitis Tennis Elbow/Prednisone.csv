0,Prednisone,Epicondylitis Tennis Elbow,1,,"November 20, 2015",8,"Few weeks ago I took Prednisone for 5 days. I have pretty bad case of Tennis elbow ( can't open a can, comb my hair, turn door knob, tie my shoes....). I took 50 mg first day, 40 mg second day, etc.Only thing I can tell is I had hard time sleep for first two days of treatment. Other than that it was like taking placebo. Absolutely no difference, still in pain.I am surprised and puzzled.",Monika123
