8,Requip,Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,9.0,,"December 23, 2008",53,"I am a 73 year old male.  I have sufered from periodic leg movement most of my life.  Lately it has been getting worse to the point that it could take me hours to fall asleep.  In addition to that, I have been having nightmares in which I try to protect myself from some threat.  My defense was to punch my wife on the arm.  I have also experienced sleep walking.  I had been taking to sleeping in the spare bedroom so that my wife could get some sleep. This was not a solution that suited either one of us.  When I began taking Requip  I experienced relief from the very first night.  I now routinely sleep the whole night through without nightmares or restless legs/periodic limp movenent.",Gerry F
