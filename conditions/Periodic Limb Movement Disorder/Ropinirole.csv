0,Ropinirole,Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 3, 2022",1,"Requip (ropinirole):requip takes away violent uncontrollable kicking, punching, sudden tightening of any muscle. Works like a miracle for me. My condition has become a nightmare over the years. In higher doses now, sound seems amplified. But as long as that torture stops...it's okay! I hear ""rls"" rls is nothing! Compared to whole body violently kerning. J.m.o.",Stickman58
1,Ropinirole,Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 28, 2021",1,"I can say that it helped me to sleep deeper but the drawback was that I started seeing a bug each time I fell asleep and then awoken to thinking it was crawling near me! Nothing there. It was an hallucination. It freaked me out! I also had a bout of vertigo! Also I felt like something was crawling on my skin. I know that it was the medication because I stopped taking it and about a week later the hallucinations disappeared. Then I tried taking the the med again and the hallucinations returned along with the crazy vivid dreams! Ropinirole is not for me, end of story.",Seeing Bugs
2,Ropinirole,Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 11, 2021",0,"Requip XL (ropinirole):I have been taking Requip XL (ropinirole) for about 4 years now and it has helped me tremendously.  I take it at night so that I can go to sleep, otherwise, the RLS tends to keep me wide awake for a long time.  Once I do take the medication, I give it about 15 minutes and then it makes it where I can lay down and go on to sleep.  If I did not have this, I would not be able to sleep at all.  The only thing I am experiencing right now, is that I had to have total knee replacement, and with this surgery, I do seem to be having more spasms from the surgery, so it is taking longer to take effect, than normal, otherwise, I have not had any issues.",Sunshine Rose

4,Ropinirole,Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 2, 2020",4,"I've had Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD) for years, occuring 4 nights out of every week. Was given Gabapentin first which didn't work, but 4 weeks ago I started using Ropinirole and it worked immediately, giving me a massively better sleeping experience. I have had no single PLM occurence since starting. My sleep still pretty fragmented, but somehow of a better quality, and more deep. Feel very pleased about it.",thinkbeforeyouspeak
5,Ropinirole,Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,10.0,,"April 22, 2020",8,"Requip XL (ropinirole):The game changer for me is the slow release XL, much less side effects. I do sometimes top up with 1mg of normal Ropinarole before bed, and then feel the side affects. Would recommend 4mg XL slow release for RLS",Rs
6,Ropinirole,Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 19, 2019",18,"I had been a bad sleeper all of my life and never realized there was a reason. I was sick of being tired so finally went to a sleep specialist and had a sleep study. He told me I had 300+ leg movements in the night. After increasing my iron and doing stretches I was still waking up, though not as much. I started on Ropinrole a few days ago and am already sleeping better. The nights are not as long as they used to be. I feel more rested during the day. I used to feel like a zombie. The first night I had a ton of really vivid dreams which was odd. Since then I've had a few each night. Not scary just boring slightly annoying dreams. Like a dream where I lose my keys and go through a day trying to find them. I haven't had any other side effects.",Lucylu
7,Ropinirole,Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 18, 2018",9,This is the best medication I have ever been on for RLS/PLMD. It has really given my quality of life back to me. I never experienced any problems with nausea or vomiting ,Bubba
8,Ropinirole,Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 9, 2018",8,"For many years I had been experiencing jerky legs, arms and total body. It became painful when I had these bouts. Around the age of 45 they became daily, sometimes multiple times a day. On top of fibromyalgia these bouts became unbearable. A doctor diagnosed me and perceived generic result. Took awhile to get the dosage adjusted. I finally was adjusted to .05 in increments up to 6 tablets before bed time to be able to sleep. It worked out great. If I have bouts during the day I will take 1 tab. I will fall asleep within 30 minutes and sleep up to 2 hours. I have lost health and prescription ins. And don't know how this is going to play out. I can't go without this drug, the pain it relieves makes life tolerable.",Karaokekate51
9,Ropinirole,Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,,,"November 13, 2016",4,I took my first 4 milligram Ropinirole tablet last night at about 8 p.m. my stomach was about Half & Half not full not empty about 45 min to an hour after I started to experience severe what I thought  flu symptoms and  I had projectile vomiting until my stomach was empty. I felt fine after my stomach was empty but I'm afraid to take another pill tonight. Does anybody have any ideas for terrible leg cramping almost crippling effects?,Katherine Casey

12,Ropinirole,Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 26, 2015",22,"Requip (ropinirole):Was it Multiple Sclerosis fatigue?  I thought I was stuck with awful 24/7 sleepiness and waking up as tired. Three months ago, I was relieved after 15   years by Ropinirole the very first dose after a new doc asked if anyone had ever mentioned me twitching at night.  Try it. It might be your miracle too!  I feel like me twenty years ago.",Seattle housewife

20,Ropinirole,Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,9.0,,"December 23, 2008",53,"Requip (ropinirole):I am a 73 year old male.  I have sufered from periodic leg movement most of my life.  Lately it has been getting worse to the point that it could take me hours to fall asleep.  In addition to that, I have been having nightmares in which I try to protect myself from some threat.  My defense was to punch my wife on the arm.  I have also experienced sleep walking.  I had been taking to sleeping in the spare bedroom so that my wife could get some sleep. This was not a solution that suited either one of us.  When I began taking Requip  I experienced relief from the very first night.  I now routinely sleep the whole night through without nightmares or restless legs/periodic limp movenent.",Gerry F
