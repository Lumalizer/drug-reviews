Initially, my primary care physician prescribed eliquis. Initially, I said, I'm not taking that. When I researched it and what it prevents decided to. The cardiologist who performed the cardioversion told me that I can go off of it 9 months after the procedure but she said most people decide to stay on it. I'm 68 and Eliquis is the ONLY drug I take. I take 5mg twice per day.  I have no ill effects from it. The aFib has not returned. I do have vein issues in my legs and that is another reason I'm staying on it.",Bob

4,Apixaban,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 13, 2021",2,Eliquis (apixaban):Just started and so far not bad. However this medicine company is all about making money. Overly priced and it's said because most insurance company's only cover a small portion of them cost. The average before deductible is 560 dollars for 30 2.5 milligrams pills. It's really not right how they hold your life hostage to get rich. You will lose your house after paying for this medicine. So many people are complaining about the price yet they still hold your life in their hand.,Mike lowry

I was prescribed Clopidogrel and 60mg Lixiana an anticoagulant. Ended up in A&E with severe vaginal bleeding. Am now on 5mg of Eliquis twice per day (no clopidogrel) and again after 2 weeks experienced heavy bleeding and ended up in hospital for 3 days having saline drip to 'irrigate' my bladder until my urine ran clear. Have not been fortunate to see a cardiologist (he has a waiting list of 38 weeks) but was under care of urologist in hospital.My GP insists taking Eliquis is preventing me from having a stroke or heart attack. But I am frightened of these  severe side effects and fear a cranial bleed . Feel tired and listless and as a formerly fit 74 year old now have no energy and trouble walking far. Am between a rock and hard place and think this drug is lethal and not fully understood by the medics. There must be an alternative as life is not worth living like this.,Jamie

10,Apixaban,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,3.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 30, 2021",10,"I was put on apixaban in Jan 2016 after taking a few attacks of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) I also have a small leak at mitral valve and will be on medication for life. I was also prescribed bisoprolol to lower BP. I felt terrible as if I had chains around my ankles and was dragging them every step I took. Read up on the 2 drugs but both had similar side effects so I went to my gp in 2017 and changed the bisoprolol to atenolol. I still the side effects so I have come to the conclusion that is was the Apixaban all along causing the problems. I get abdominal pain daily and get so breathless even doing the slightest thing. I can't go out shopping as I used to do as the breathlessness is awful. My gp said my oxygen levels were fine, but I feel as if there is a giant peg on my nose and cannot get a breath. It has been worse since COVID as the masks make me feel worse. The only good thing is that I haven't had any more AFib attacks since 2017 I wonder if half the 5 mg dose 2x day would help.

Since 2013 I am on Eliquis 5 mg twice a day. From day one I had no adverse effects whatsoever. In the meantime I also had an ablation which really produced wonders: I reduced the Apocard to the minimum dose of 100mg and hardly get any palpitations anymore. I take large daily doses of magnesium (400-500 mg) with Vitamine B6. On days when predisposition to palpitations is higher I also take Calmday 5 mg one or twice.

Over the years, she deteriorated mentally and physically from the stroke, and her dementia had almost completely incapacitated her mentally.  She finally had another stroke and the doc took her off the aspirin and Plavix and put her on Eliquis.  In less than a week, Mom was almost back to her pre-first-stroke self, mentally.  We had almost a whole good year with Mom mentally/dementia-wise.  I really, really wish Eliquis had been around years earlier so Mom could have gotten it after Stroke 1 (or even before then) because it made such a difference after Stroke 2.The only thing was Mom had to be moved from 5 mg to 2.5 mg because she was very elderly and small and had some minor bleeding behind her eyes.  This resolved itself almost immediately after the dosage change.",Sam

Four days on Eliquis was more than enough, just got back from the ER where we spent the night getting her checked out. She experienced tremors, fatigue, nausea, loss of balance, and basically felt like rubbish! This drug seems quite dangerous, even though our cardiologist tells us she has successfully placed hundreds on the drug. I would not recommend it to anyone!!!",Nick

Within 4 days I had 3 episodes of it and was finally put on metoprolol to control my heart rate. It's now been 2 months and I still continue to have episodes of tachycardia with the flushing of adrenaline feeling. I'm also feeling dizzy quite often and in a fog a lot of the time.

The Cardiologist insisted since he has had Atrial Fib when ever he has a health crisis. So on the Plavix he had some nasty bruising when ever he had blood drawn. Now on the Eliquis he has swelling in his hands and arms. Worse is the swelling of face around the mouth and lips. He also loses his voice from pharyngeal swelling. His breathing is fine. It usually settles down after a few hrs but last time it took longer. We cut the Eliquis in half and reduced the dose but he has had the same reaction again. It happens after taking it in the evening and swelling comes up over night. Changing back to Aspirin to see if the Eliquis is the problem. He is also on Toprol or Metaprolol which he has also cut back on to 50mg once a day. His BP and pulse are fine. Age 74 and almost completely incapacitated by these drugs.

Hate it and hate the metoprolol I am also taking. Both have exact same side effects so hard to tell which causes me problems. I had ringing in the ears before these meds but meds make it way worse. Aches all over. Kidneys hurt. Headaches most of the time. Itching. Starting to lose hair. Tingling in legs and feet. I think the metoprolol causes the frequent urination but I think so does Eliquis.   When you get a printout from the Dr or pharmacy you only get a few of the side effects. I use this Drugs.com site to find out ALL side effects of any med. I have been told through the years by different Drs how well I do with pain. I felt so bad today I just cried.

Eliquis caused my husband to be very sick. He had atrial flutter. But try natural remedies to strengthen the heart like Hawthorn solid extract and coQ10.

My truly emergency treatment was 72 hours of intravenous heparin started in the ICU of my hospital, switching to oral Eliquis on the 4th day.Sad to say, my Medicare Part D formulary will require my switch to another equivalent drug after covering Eliquis through this month.  Not to worry, there are three effective and FDA approved drugs in this category of Factor Xa inhibitors of coagulation (clotting) and I can safely switch to the one covered in my Medicare D plan next month.",EBR MD

I have only been on it for 2 weeks but after the first several days, I have noticed an increasing burning/flushing sensation similar to a sun burn over most of my body.  I have not had any gastrointestinal upset.I will continue to take Eliquis for a few more days but may have to discontinue it.",Delroy
