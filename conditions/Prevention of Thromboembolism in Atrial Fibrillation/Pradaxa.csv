0,Pradaxa,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 9, 2022",0,"After reading comments on other blood thinners, I needed to make comments on Pradaxa. I was in the hospital in December of 2012, 9 years ago and at that time put on Pradaxa. I have had no complications I know off and no more serious Afib situations. We were looking into different alternatives due to an insurance big jump in co-pay. I spent considerable time researching options. I was horrified at some of the review comments I read regarding the alternatives. I will suck it up and stay with Pradaxa. Another big plus is that Pradaxa has now an antidote if need be. I take 150 mg once a day that I feel is adequate for me, longer half-life in system. We raise and eat a lot of garlic also. I hope this writing helps someone with their choices.",Pradaxa

The first two months, I really thought I would have to go back to warfarin due to stomach/bowel problems and significant heartburn.  After a couple of months, the digestive and bowel problems gradually went away.  I also discovered the heartburn was reduced by taking the pill right before or during a meal (not just a snack), along with taking it with a full glass of water, and not lying down for an hour or so after taking it.  I'm relieved that I can stay on it since I hated being on warfarin.  Hopefully the cost becomes more reasonable.",AmieAkka

However, I do not have a history of these problems.  I'm not happy though because my cardiologist is forbidding me to take ANY of my Celebrex now.  No NSAIDs at all.  I have severe arthritis in one knee (knee replacement in the other knee) and now I have joint pain that is getting worse.  I admit I have sneaked a few Celebrex in and the pain relief was immediate.  So I need to be able to go back to that medicine.  I've scheduled an ablation in a few weeks and hopefully that will do the trick.  I have never had any type of stroke and the use of this medicine is purely a preventive measure because I do have irregular heartbeats at times.",TheToadie

Every time I take this pill I have a severe case of acid reflux and heart burn. Nothing seems to help relieve the burning. I also have ulcers in my stomach and it always makes me feel nauseated. I had been using Coumadin since 2001 and had a lot of bruising and bleeding problems. I believe Pradaxa would be good if it wouldn't be so harsh on the stomach and esophagus.",CJ foe

Just some heartburn, (that went away after taking it for about a week) and some stomach issues. But nothing so severe that I would stop taking it and go back to Lovenox shots everyday. In the past I have been on Coumadin (once a day for 2 years) and Lovenox injections (once a day for 1 year) Pradaxa is by FAR the best blood thinner! ",CJ27

For the first couple of weeks, I thought I would be one of the fortunate ones as I had no side effects.  However, the longer I take it, the more side effects I experience.  I cannot take it on an empty stomach, or even with only a light meal.  I have heartburn, especially at night, plus the bowel issues, which seem to get worse daily.  I don't want to go back to Coumadin, though.  I'm going to have ablation surgery and if it goes as planned, I hope to be able to stop taking blood thinner after a few weeks.",Amieakka

It seems the food on top of the medicine works better than the other way around (food first, medicine second). Small snacks are not sufficient to suppress the acid attacks. Also, I have to take Nexium to reduce stomach acid production. I have to take it at least 1 hour before breakfast to be effective. According to the company, no testing has been done re: Nexium interference with Pradaxa. I noticed a marked improvement re: bleeding and bruising in comparison to Coumadin.",Anonymous

Also I have had bleeding ulcers twice so I'm a bit concerned about that. However checked with my Doctor who told me to take pill after meals. I tried this, but also discovered the pills must be taken IMMEDIATELY after eating food (not snacks but full meals). I also use Ranitidine with the Pradaxa and found it works. Much more comfort, almost no heartburn, just a slight sensation. I haven't had an INT test so at the moment I don't know if my coagulation levels are okay. But I will do that soon. Overall I feel that using this new medicine I feel better, so I hope this will continue, its a bit early to make the final judgment.",Anonymous

75,Pradaxa,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,8.0,,"January 23, 2011",161,I've taken Pradaxa for two weeks and have seen a great reduction in the soreness in my joints and muscles vs Coumadin.  I have also seen a steady improvement in my stamina levels.  I also believe small nicks and cuts heal a little faster and bleeding is not quite as pronounced as with Coumadin when you do accidentally nick yourself.  I haven't experienced any digestive problems as listed as a side effect.  It may be too soon the pass judgment on this drug because of the short time I've taken it.  The only negative I've found so far is the expense of Pradaxa. It is SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive than Coumadin and I hope the manufacturer of this drug will work to reduce the cost so more people can benefit from it.,Some Guy with A-Fib
