0,Warfarin,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 17, 2019",8,"Have been on Warfarin for nearly 7 years. My INR is usually between 2 and 3 which it’s supposed to be. Due to circumstances it has fluctuated between 3.1 and 1.8 recently. This  is due to a change in diet and activity levels because of serious family medical  issues. So I say to you, it really does matter a lot what you do. The other thing is that I get large purple-red bruises on the top of my hands & arms.",Danny’s Girl
1,Warfarin,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,7,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 15, 2018",18,"As a result of a stroke and AF I was put on Warfarin ten years ago. Apart from some bruising and keeping track of my INR I have no probs. For convenience my doctor has recently changed me to Eliquis but I’m not happy with it. Side affects: loss of appetite, dry mouth , incontinence, dizziness, tiredness. I’ll be going back to my doctor.",Confused
2,Warfarin,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 25, 2016",35,"Coumadin (warfarin):Developed atrial flutter then atrial fibrillation several years post-op. This and beta-blocker really straightened it out. Cardiologist took me off Coumadin a few years ago for a month. He had to put me back on it due to flutter that just wouldn't quit... took a few weeks to straighten me out again. It was his idea, not mine. Only drawback is monitoring amount of green vegetables eaten every day and need a PT drawn every 2 weeks or so.",mitral valve replaced 10 years

5,Warfarin,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,10,,"November 9, 2010",170,"Coumadin (warfarin):I was at a convention in Palm Springs when I was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.  Could not breathe, excruciating pain, scared to death.  When I got to the ER my heart was beating at 180 beats per minute.  The doctors told me the only thing that probably saved me from having a stroke was that I was already on Coumadin as I have a genetic blood disorder, factor 5 Leiden which means I will be on Coumadin for the rest of my life.  My doctors are so cautious that they actually had a bird's nest inserted into my vena cava just in case a clot were to ever break lose.  I have never had problems in the 6 years I have been on Coumadin.  My INR is always at 2.5 which is considered perfect since my target range is between 2.0 and 3.0.",mexyweeds
