1,Eliquis,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 10, 2021",1,"I was diagnosed with aFib 2 years ago. Initially, my primary care physician prescribed eliquis. Initially, I said, I'm not taking that. When I researched it and what it prevents decided to. The cardiologist who performed the cardioversion told me that I can go off of it 9 months after the procedure but she said most people decide to stay on it. I'm 68 and Eliquis is the ONLY drug I take. I take 5mg twice per day.  I have no ill effects from it. The aFib has not returned. I do have vein issues in my legs and that is another reason I'm staying on it.",Bob

Worst medication devised by mankind!  From bruises to discolored skin, and painful skin to the touch.  If anyone including myself touches my skin, it causes me pain. My cardiologist says the benefits outweigh the side effects. Maybe he'll end up on it some day, and then if I'm still alive he can get in touch with me with his experiences.",Reverend
3,Eliquis,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 13, 2021",2,Just started and so far not bad. However this medicine company is all about making money. Overly priced and it's said because most insurance company's only cover a small portion of them cost. The average before deductible is 560 dollars for 30 2.5 milligrams pills. It's really not right how they hold your life hostage to get rich. You will lose your house after paying for this medicine. So many people are complaining about the price yet they still hold your life in their hand.,Mike lowry
4,Eliquis,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 9, 2021",5,I had a TIA in October 2020 and was diagnosed with Atrial fibrillation. I was prescribed Clopidogrel and 60mg Lixiana an anticoagulant. Ended up in A&E with severe vaginal bleeding. Am now on 5mg of Eliquis twice per day (no clopidogrel) and again after 2 weeks experienced heavy bleeding and ended up in hospital for 3 days having saline drip to 'irrigate' my bladder until my urine ran clear. Have not been fortunate to see a cardiologist (he has a waiting list of 38 weeks) but was under care of urologist in hospital.My GP insists taking Eliquis is preventing me from having a stroke or heart attack. But I am frightened of these  severe side effects and fear a cranial bleed . Feel tired and listless and as a formerly fit 74 year old now have no energy and trouble walking far. Am between a rock and hard place and think this drug is lethal and not fully understood by the medics. There must be an alternative as life is not worth living like this.,Jamie

In 2007 I got Apocard (Flecainide) 250 mg and Asaflow 160 mg, then 80 mg until 2012-2013 when I got a gastritis largely because of the Asaflow (practically Aspirin). Since 2013 I am on Eliquis 5 mg twice a day. From day one I had no adverse effects whatsoever. In the meantime I also had an ablation which really produced wonders: I reduced the Apocard to the minimum dose of 100mg and hardly get any palpitations anymore. I take large daily doses of magnesium (400-500 mg) with Vitamine B6. On days when predisposition to palpitations is higher I also take Calmday 5 mg one or twice.

11,Eliquis,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 11, 2021",6,"Eliquis gave me my Mom back.Mom had a stroke years before Eliquis was available and was put on aspirin and Plavix.  Over the years, she deteriorated mentally and physically from the stroke, and her dementia had almost completely incapacitated her mentally.  She finally had another stroke and the doc took her off the aspirin and Plavix and put her on Eliquis.  In less than a week, Mom was almost back to her pre-first-stroke self, mentally.  We had almost a whole good year with Mom mentally/dementia-wise.  I really, really wish Eliquis had been around years earlier so Mom could have gotten it after Stroke 1 (or even before then) because it made such a difference after Stroke 2.The only thing was Mom had to be moved from 5 mg to 2.5 mg because she was very elderly and small and had some minor bleeding behind her eyes.  This resolved itself almost immediately after the dosage change.",Sam

Four days on Eliquis was more than enough, just got back from the ER where we spent the night getting her checked out. She experienced tremors, fatigue, nausea, loss of balance, and basically felt like rubbish! This drug seems quite dangerous, even though our cardiologist tells us she has successfully placed hundreds on the drug. I would not recommend it to anyone!!!",Nick

The Cardiologist insisted since he has had Atrial Fib when ever he has a health crisis. So on the Plavix he had some nasty bruising when ever he had blood drawn. Now on the Eliquis he has swelling in his hands and arms. Worse is the swelling of face around the mouth and lips. He also loses his voice from pharyngeal swelling. His breathing is fine. It usually settles down after a few hrs but last time it took longer. We cut the Eliquis in half and reduced the dose but he has had the same reaction again. It happens after taking it in the evening and swelling comes up over night. Changing back to Aspirin to see if the Eliquis is the problem. He is also on Toprol or Metaprolol which he has also cut back on to 50mg once a day. His BP and pulse are fine. Age 74 and almost completely incapacitated by these drugs.

20,Eliquis,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,1.0,,"August 5, 2020",167,Been on Eliquis a little over a month after having one Afib attack. 2.5 mg twice a day. Hate it and hate the metoprolol I am also taking. Both have exact same side effects so hard to tell which causes me problems. I had ringing in the ears before these meds but meds make it way worse. Aches all over. Kidneys hurt. Headaches most of the time. Itching. Starting to lose hair. Tingling in legs and feet. I think the metoprolol causes the frequent urination but I think so does Eliquis.   When you get a printout from the Dr or pharmacy you only get a few of the side effects. I use this Drugs.com site to find out ALL side effects of any med. I have been told through the years by different Drs how well I do with pain. I felt so bad today I just cried.  This stuff is poison. 68 yr old female with no other health problems. Til I started taking this poison. May look into natural treatment before this stuff is awful. So sick.,Lindy

Eliquis caused my husband to be very sick. He had atrial flutter. But try natural remedies to strengthen the heart like Hawthorn solid extract and coQ10. Speak to a herbalist natural may work for you. Pharma just wants to keep you on medications for the money they only treat the symptoms not the underlying condition which could be a mineral deficiency or something to strengthen the heart..

All in all the joint pain was unreal and I took myself off of the 2.5 mg twice a day that I was taking (even though my prescription was 5 mg twice a day). Eliquis has lactose in it and I am lactose intolerant so I immediately noticed a problem and that is why I cut my pills in half to give me a 2.5 mg pill.  That did solve the lactose problem with the joint issues were not solved until I got off of the medication.
