1,Xarelto,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,3.0,,"April 24, 2021",4,"First 2 days, facial swelling. Puffy forehead, and swelling above and below eyes. My eyelids thickened to twice the normal thickness. Facial swelling and swollen tongue for 8 months now and my skin has thinned  and I’m losing all of the muscle elasticity.  My research found long term use of blood thinners depletes the 2nd layer of our skin, destroying elasticity. Top layer (epidermis) becomes dried out and wrinkled, like crepe paper. If this is what is happening visually to the outside of my body, what’s it doing to my internal organs?  Will kidney or liver damage or a brain bleed be next?  Yet all I hear is that if you quit it you may have a stroke!  Never had a problem with aspirin. I am stuck on a drug that has such horrible side affects. Biggest FEAR is of bleeding to death since the antidote to stop profuse bleeding is SO EXPENSIVE that many hospitals don’t have it on hand to save one’s life!  One dose may cost from $30,000 to $50,000 according to my research!!",Worried User
2,Xarelto,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 27, 2018",34,I’m writing this to let anyone / everyone to please stay away from Xarelto. It killed my father within months.  My mom and Dad were married 50 years he made it a couple months after their 50th wedding anniversary. My Mother and I will never forget the day that change our lives forever because of this medication. It cause him to have a stroke and bleed to death. There is no reversing to Xarelto. It is very dangerous and the pharmaceutical companies don’t care as long as there getting there money. Please stop your love ones from taking Xarelto.  Please!!,Douglas Graybill
3,Xarelto,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 10, 2015",18,"I just had open heart surgery in late July 2015. Nobody told me that a 'side effect' of the surgery was atrial fibrillation.  It took over a MONTH for the Docs to tell me this, then put me on amiodarone (antiarrhythmic med) and Xarelto.  Not sure if the Xarelto is causing the issue, but I think it is!  I have been on the drug for less than 2 weeks, and now have several issues surfacing like tidal waves:  Inability to control my hands while typing *80  wpm down to MAYBE 30 on a good day; bloodshot eyes that are only getting worse, purple veins protruding from my thigh skin that were never there before, pain in my liver... I could go on.  This is scary and I can't see my cardiologist for a week",Concerned & Suspicious
4,Xarelto,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,,,"November 2, 2013",49,"I was on Coumadin from 2008 to 2012 following a stroke, and was very difficult to regulate with lots of bruising and constant visits to the doctor.  Xarelto has given me my life back, and I feel GREAT!  I've had zero problems with the drug, and no bruising or bleeding.  I think I feel so much better and happier because I'm not constantly worried about my PT/INR level and what I'm eating.",The B

6,Xarelto,Prevention of Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 10, 2012",175,"I was put on Xeralto as an alternative to Warfarin four days before my colonoscopy and endoscopy, stopped one day ahead of the procedures, and resumed 3 days after.  I had already been anemic, probably because of bleeding due to the Warfarin (which is reversable with Vitamin K).  Several polyps were removed, including one large one that had to be partly removed, and later on toget the other part.  I was now bleeding even worse with the Xeralto.  My hemoglobin fell to 5.2, and I was given several transfusions. Hb rose to 8.7, and I was sent home.  The Xeralto has no way to reverse bleeding, and if it is discontinued, there is an increased chance for a stroke.  I would prefer to have Warfarin and a way to reverse the bleeding.",MontyP1
