0,Jolivette,Amenorrhea,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 29, 2018",5,"I previously had heavy periods for more than 10 days with heavy bleeding. This caused me to have iron infusions on a regular basis. I was losing my hair, had high blood pressure, insomnia, migraines and the list goes on..after only 2 months on Jolivette .35 my periods are what I think are normal. I've never had a normal period ever. I'm currently using panty liners with regular or light tampons. Prior to this only overnight pads and Super + tampons. All other symptoms have all gone away. Only minor cramping. Love this new pill. Let's see what the next few months brings.",Corporate Gal
1,Jolivette,Amenorrhea,7,,"January 2, 2016",3,"Began taking this a month ago for heavy periods and cysts. Not sure if I want to start the second pack after having an ocular migraine for 4 days. I take this like clockwork every night. Haven't had a period yet, no other side effects. Not sure if it's worth it, migraine or massive heavy periods? I'd almost rather have to wear 2 pads than be out for 4 plus days and counting with this migraine.",Bkittinger
