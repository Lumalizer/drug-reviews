0,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2021",0,"Incassia (norethindrone):Neurologist wanted me to consult with menopause expert to consider HRT. She declined, Estrogen hormone replacement therapy is contraindicated, as I have liver problems, migraines with aura (newer research busted that myth) and family history of stroke. 9 months ago, I started having hot flashes every day around 2pm for 3 hours. Intense long flashes, then chills, nausea, migraine attack. Brutal! Couldn’t work, couldn’t go out without a change of clothes and hair ties! New Gyn started me on low dose progesterone. Unbelievable difference. Hot flashes are lesser, shorter, but vary in time. And migraines are better!",MDDMom
1,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 18, 2021",2,"Errin (norethindrone):Starting Erin has seriously been a life-changer. I’m 37 and for the last two years or so I’ve been dealing with major hormonal fluctuations, migraines, super heavy periods lasting 10 days, mood swings, insomnia you name it.. basically all the symptoms that come along with peri menopause. All of my symptoms essentially disappeared after taking Errin … and the best part is my mood has significantly improved. I’m more calm, and feel more at peace on the daily. I SO happy I decided to give this a try.",Danielle
2,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2021",2,"20 year old and wanted to delay my period. I took it 2 days before I was due and stopped taking it after 4 days. I started my period 4 days after I stopped taking the medication. I was very heavy the first few days, and had minor but kind of bad cramps. I’d say although the medication worked, it really heightened my anxiety and my pms was a lot worse. I think ruining my cycle obviously had bad effects on my pms - I was truly terrible for 4 days and am slightly better now, but would recommend thinking twice before taking it if your pms is bad and if you tend to overthinking and have anxiety already .. and if you only want to delay it for a few days - maybe having your period is the better option lol",bloop
3,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 1, 2020",7,"Heather (norethindrone):Biggest side effects starting on this Heather pill were terrible headaches, fatigue, acne. Decided the side effects were not worth the benefit. Decided to try some natural remedies instead.",Kate Nance
4,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,8.0,,"December 22, 2019",1,I have been on this pill for about 6 days now. I have heavy period with cramps to the point where I have had to go to the hospital. I am going on a vacation tomorrow so I decided to take them. This is what I will say You might have the SMALLEST amount of blood but it is extremely not noticeable.You may bloat but honestly I did not bloat at allThey say that water retention will happen. I drink a litre of water a day and I did not see that. I have PMD  and I have never felt this normal when my period is meant to be around the corner or starting. I did not get acne Ask about the concerns with your doctor.,lilian
5,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 5, 2019",1,"Started on high dose two years ago (5mgs) for terrible cramps in my late 49’s. Didn’t have a period for six months which was great. New gyno lowered it to .35 of a mg as is usual and have suffered ever since with terrible cramps, multiple periods per month now, spotting, weight gain. Seeing gyno this week to end this suffering. I’m so mad as I’m now turning 50 and want menopause to start so I can end this 35 years of pain. I also have a small fibroid and wasn’t able to carry children.",Beamer
6,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,9.0,,"August 13, 2019",8,"Ortho Micronor (norethindrone):I have been on Micronor for 3 years. I have migraines with aura so this was the only birth control possible for me at the time. I was 16 when I first started the pill and got very light spotting at first, then everything disappeared. I didn't get my period for 2 years, no PMS, no spotting, no nothing. I didn't gain any weight, no acne, no headache. It was bliss for 2 years, then anxiety came by. I had nausea all the time and I didn't want to eat, so I lost 15 pounds in one summer (I was 18, 5'9 and 125 pounds before). Then around November last year I started having my period again. Before the pill, I was regular and had little to no PMS, but now I had crazy nausea, headache, sore breasts and bloating for a week before I got my period. Plus, it lasted longer than before and hurt so much more. Now, I get my period every 4 to 5 days and they last 6 days. I will be switching to Kyleena (an IUD) soon. I'm giving this 9 on 10 because it gave me peace of mind for 2 years and I never got pregnant.",Anonymous
7,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 6, 2018",3,"Nora-Be (norethindrone):So I was on Nora-Be for 2 years I gained like 40 lbs no change I eating habits.  It was supposed to replace my previous birth control pill Yaz which I think worked way better.  After starting pill my periods became longer 7 days or more it was 3-5 days I also had almost constant spotting have to wear pad all the time.  I recently stopped due to all these reasons my biggest reason I had crippling depression, anxiety, extreme fatigue, abdominal pain. Almost immediately after stopping the pill my depression and stomach pain went away.  I now have the energy to work on loosing the weight. Do no recommend this Pill and has to be taken at the exact same time very inconvenient.",Angie
8,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 29, 2018",5,"Jolivette (norethindrone):I previously had heavy periods for more than 10 days with heavy bleeding. This caused me to have iron infusions on a regular basis. I was losing my hair, had high blood pressure, insomnia, migraines and the list goes on..after only 2 months on Jolivette .35 my periods are what I think are normal. I've never had a normal period ever. I'm currently using panty liners with regular or light tampons. Prior to this only overnight pads and Super + tampons. All other symptoms have all gone away. Only minor cramping. Love this new pill. Let's see what the next few months brings.",Corporate Gal
9,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,8.0,,"March 31, 2018",2,I'm not a breastfeeding mom I'm a 19 year old who can't take estrogen because of seizures. My skin broke out at first along with irregular bleeding but levelled out after two months. Norlyda has done a great job controlling cramps and hasn't caused any horrendous side effects.,Anonymous
10,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,,,"January 3, 2018",4,"Nora-Be (norethindrone):So let's just start with the fact I'm trans (FTM) and that I was on another medication right before this. Went to my doctor to switch medication to stop horrible mood swings, headaches, nausea etc, the Nora BE  was prescribed started a period 15 days after my original December one. It's now day 7 of this period (mine used to be 3-5 days mind that) and its just rubbish. I was told it'd thin out my lining so then I don't have a period EVER again, but now I don't believe them and I'm gonna email my doctor about it because she said it WOULDN'T do what it's currently doing to me.  She even said because it'd stop the periods, I'd stop feeling so much dysphoria around my gender...haha that's a lie.",nickoli

12,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 7, 2016",3,"I was taking a combination estrogen patch along with a progesterone pill. My insurance decided they would no longer cover the progesterone so my Doctor put me on norethindrone. I have been taking it for 3 weeks and I finally realized yesterday what was happening to me. I have been in such a horrible mood that I cant stand myself. I am sick to my stomach, my blood sugar dropped, I cant sleep, it has been a nighmare. I am better off just going through menopause the natural way.",Stlmo

14,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 7, 2016",4,I was told to take norethindrone for 10 days... no biggie compared to some of you who have been on it for years!....  its officially been 9 days....  and I am so excited to be done!!!  So I started taking these pills because I haven't had a period for more than a year...  and my doc said this would jump start it.  He said that the meds would give bloodflow to my uterine lining and once there was no pills everything would just come out.....lets hope its true because I sure as hell didn't do this for nothing....I have been really hormonal.... crying alot... angry at my husband for no reason...  really irritable....almost any sound annoys meI hope I never have to take this again,Irosas0829
15,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,7.0,,"January 2, 2016",3,"Jolivette (norethindrone):Began taking this a month ago for heavy periods and cysts. Not sure if I want to start the second pack after having an ocular migraine for 4 days. I take this like clockwork every night. Haven't had a period yet, no other side effects. Not sure if it's worth it, migraine or massive heavy periods? I'd almost rather have to wear 2 pads than be out for 4 plus days and counting with this migraine.",Bkittinger
16,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,,,"July 16, 2015",19,"Ortho Micronor (norethindrone):I have never reacted well to hormonal medication. Even on Mirena, I had serious reactions. I expected horrible things from Micronor. I was wrong. After 3 weeks of headaches and sore breasts, I felt better than normal. My skin has cleared up, I've lost 10lbs, gained a cup size, and my libido has increased. Most importantly, my periods have become regular, lowering my cancer risks. While I wish it didn't function as birth control, it's an acceptable side effect for me right now, as there are no medications for this that aren't birth control!",Kate Manson

18,Norethindrone,Amenorrhea,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 4, 2014",13,"I was put on this because I got into a heated argument at where I worked at the time and went to my gyno right after and so my blood pressure was elevated. I told my doctor about what happened but to be safe she put me on this since it doesn't contain estrogen. I LOVED it. I didn't get my period for nearly 2 years. And then I don't know what happened, maybe I wasn't taking it at exactly the same time anymore (actually now that I think of it I wasn't). So my doctor put me on LoSeasonique but I don't want to get my period at all so I think I'm going to go back on this.",AnoukG
