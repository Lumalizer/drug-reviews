0,Lorazepam,Status Epilepticus,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 17, 2020",6,"I take Lorazepam when I feel 'wobbly' and a seizure could be coming on and it immediately stops the seizure activity in its tracks.  I've had epilepsy for 20 year and ever since I had the option to take a rescue med such as lorazepam about 5 years ago, I haven't had any seizures at all.  I am conscious of the addictive nature of the medication though and I can see that I am becoming more dependent on it during times of minor anxiety so I might need to address that.  The doctor is very cautious and only prescribes 20 every two months so I need to moderate my intake.",Rhilets
1,Lorazepam,Status Epilepticus,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 30, 2020",6,"Ativan (lorazepam):I have Non Epileptic seizures and bad ones. When I wake in the hospital after they've given me the shots it's horrible. I throw up all over the place and according to my family they give it to me to knock me out so they don't have to deal with the ""fight or flight child like state"" I'm in when I come to. In fact my husband stopped them from giving me another shot because he told them I would more likely co-operate if they didn't keep giving me shots. I am not conscious and the person that they deal with isn't the real me. I can't sleep now though and I'm feeling very sad and can't stop crying. I feel a little slower this time then usual and it's been 2 days so I'll be going to see a doctor to talk about my mood, memory, and sleep. Hopefully I can find a group to talk to because I need one. Saw someone takes the pills when they feel their aura coming on and that it helps so we'll see about that.",Bubz
2,Lorazepam,Status Epilepticus,1.0,,"October 3, 2019",1,"I have seizures and afterwards it leaves my brain utterly scrambled. It can take weeks before I feel normal. My doctor prescribed ativan taken as needed to help me relax postictal (after seizure). I had no idea how addictive it was but when I discovered how much it helped me fall asleep I started taking 1mg every night. It wasn't until I tried to stop that I realized how addicted my body had become. Been taking 1mg a night for years. Earlier this year I had a bad seizure that took weeks to recover from and was taking x2 day which left me 14 short. When I went to refill it the pharmacy refused because it was too early. I ended up in the ER. I have never felt the pain of withdrawals before, it was enough to make me decide to stop. Been tapering for a couple months, Just tapered down to .25 mg a night. So far no big issues. A week after each taper I've been taking melatonin to help me sleep. I think that has helped. I would advise people stay away from benzos. Like me one day you may be cut off.",Tom S.

4,Lorazepam,Status Epilepticus,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 8, 2019",2,My son with seizures at early age was already on Dilantin for seizures but the Doctors wanted to replace Dilantin with a different drug. Over a period of years they again mention to try out new medications. He went in and was given Lorazepam for replacement for Dilantin. He came home and less than  a week it was horrible. He was returned back to the hospital where they stopped the Lorazepam and now I am attempting to get him back to where he was at with the dilantin but he is hallucinating and it is so terrifying the images he is experiencing. I do hope that this will soon pass and we are so disappointed with what has happened. He lost all mobility at one point .. Be careful with this med.. :(,SolaZippo
5,Lorazepam,Status Epilepticus,10.0,,"November 2, 2017",7,Ativan (lorazepam):Was withdrawing from fentanyl heroin and a little bit from suboxone. It takes away most symptoms but xanax and klonopin work better. Ativan works great for anxiety tho. And lasts 6/7 hours for me.,Xannicandi
6,Lorazepam,Status Epilepticus,6.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 3, 2017",3,Use as a rescue medication to break seizure clusters.  I only take when needed.  Which isn't often thankfully.,Dhaniboi
7,Lorazepam,Status Epilepticus,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 7, 2017",12,"Ativan (lorazepam):This med works well for calming my head after a seizure(s). I have partial seizures. Started using it 2 years ago, 'as needed' Recently I'm attempting to discontinue any use of this medicine. My dosage is only 0.5 sublingual. The withdrawal symptoms are absolutely brutal. It's a low dose. I'm not sure if my sensitivity to medication and time taken affects the detox. I didn't expect the nightmares, nausea, exhaustion, fuzzy head. I am glad this med helped when needed, but can say, I'll never return to using it.",KaterinaSernowski
8,Lorazepam,Status Epilepticus,10.0,,"December 12, 2016",9,"Lorazepam has changed my life. I've had seizures for 20 years now. After being prescribed this, my seizures have been less frequent and it has  actually stopped seizures from happening! I take them as soon as I feel the aura.",Tesseract
9,Lorazepam,Status Epilepticus,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2013",63,"Ativan (lorazepam):I keep Ativan in a small container in my pocket at all times!  When I feel a generalized tonic clonic (grand mal) seizure coming on, I put one in my mouth, chew it up, swallow it, and prevents or stops the seizure immediately.  I am no longer afraid of status epilepticus because Ativan protects me.  I'm thankful they exist.",Epilepsy Advocate
