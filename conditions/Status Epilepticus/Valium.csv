0,Valium,Status Epilepticus,10.0,,"November 18, 2019",15,"I used to have a brain tumor when I was in high school, and since then I suffer extreme panic disorder, status epilepticus, and  was recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. I take 15 to 20 mg daily, along with Klonopin. The Valium helps when I have continuous seizures and muscle spasms in my legs because of my M.S. The klonopin helps for my seizures as well. I was born with a deficiency in my GABA receptors, which is why I am taking both. The Valium gives me no side effects and helps my muscle spasms so much. I used to be in tears every night because I was in so much pain. It has helped me regain partial control of my life again, and I got back on the deans list at my university. I hope this helps as much as it is helping me.",Nick
