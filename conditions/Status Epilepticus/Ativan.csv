0,Ativan,Status Epilepticus,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 30, 2020",6,"I have Non Epileptic seizures and bad ones. When I wake in the hospital after they've given me the shots it's horrible. I throw up all over the place and according to my family they give it to me to knock me out so they don't have to deal with the ""fight or flight child like state"" I'm in when I come to. In fact my husband stopped them from giving me another shot because he told them I would more likely co-operate if they didn't keep giving me shots. I am not conscious and the person that they deal with isn't the real me. I can't sleep now though and I'm feeling very sad and can't stop crying. I feel a little slower this time then usual and it's been 2 days so I'll be going to see a doctor to talk about my mood, memory, and sleep. Hopefully I can find a group to talk to because I need one. Saw someone takes the pills when they feel their aura coming on and that it helps so we'll see about that.",Bubz
1,Ativan,Status Epilepticus,10,,"November 2, 2017",7,Was withdrawing from fentanyl heroin and a little bit from suboxone. It takes away most symptoms but xanax and klonopin work better. Ativan works great for anxiety tho. And lasts 6/7 hours for me.,Xannicandi
2,Ativan,Status Epilepticus,5,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 7, 2017",12,"This med works well for calming my head after a seizure(s). I have partial seizures. Started using it 2 years ago, 'as needed' Recently I'm attempting to discontinue any use of this medicine. My dosage is only 0.5 sublingual. The withdrawal symptoms are absolutely brutal. It's a low dose. I'm not sure if my sensitivity to medication and time taken affects the detox. I didn't expect the nightmares, nausea, exhaustion, fuzzy head. I am glad this med helped when needed, but can say, I'll never return to using it.",KaterinaSernowski
3,Ativan,Status Epilepticus,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2013",63,"I keep Ativan in a small container in my pocket at all times!  When I feel a generalized tonic clonic (grand mal) seizure coming on, I put one in my mouth, chew it up, swallow it, and prevents or stops the seizure immediately.  I am no longer afraid of status epilepticus because Ativan protects me.  I'm thankful they exist.",Epilepsy Advocate
