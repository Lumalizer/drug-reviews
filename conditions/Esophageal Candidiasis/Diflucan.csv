0,Diflucan,Esophageal Candidiasis,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 9, 2019",15,"My experience was the same as the first reviewer  on this page. Bad side effects, pretty much the same as above, and add mood swings and depressed mood. Had to be switched to another antifungal that isn't much better. In addition it turns out that there are possible/probable interactions with other meds I am taking. Some of them quite serious. If I could find this information in less than five minutes, why can't a doctor or pharmacist ?  Some of these interactions can be life threatening. I should say that I am very sensitive to many antibiotics and antifungals, so your mileage may vary.",jim
1,Diflucan,Esophageal Candidiasis,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 7, 2019",15,"ShugarCookieThis medicine cleared up my infection in 3 days. So 10 for efficacy.Solid 0 with regard to side effects. It's like a vision quest! I made it through 25 days of these 100 mg demons...when I landed in the hospital with dangerously low blood serum sodium. The side effects are over the moon. I had sour stomach, loss of coordination, loss of sleep and, of appetite, constipation  ,rapid heart  beat, weakness, dizziness and possible seizures, tremors, jumpiness, confusion.There is no way I could drive a car on this. This pill will chew you up and spit you out. But it cleared up my esophageal thrush in no time flat. I'm not sure if 30 days is overkill or not. I couldn't tolerate it from the first week! Maybe I'm allergic to it as my upper lip is split since I began the course?Don't be a me and ignore the side effects and end up the emergency room.",Anonymous
2,Diflucan,Esophageal Candidiasis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 2, 2019",12,"I was prescribed Diflucan in the ER for an over the Moon sore throat I had had for 2 weeks.—100 mg for 30 days. The side effects are TERRIBLE. It was approximately 2 weeks into the prescription that I began noticing just how truly weak I was. Dizzy not the the best description. More like brain fog + really severe confusion? Being too weak to walk a straight line. My depth perception is severely is out of whack. I have fallen on stairs 3 times since starting this  awful med. The dry skin started right off the bat. The skin on my face and neck is drying out and sloughing off like dandruff. l have a painful lip crack moisturizer can beat out Diflucan. I’m constipated have ,7 days to go. I’m going to have to muscle through it. While having vertigo, stumbling around on shaky legs, constipated, with split a lip, and no appetite what so ever because I’m so nauseous.I do not recommend this medication AT ALL. For me it’s necessary. Just 7 more days of pure misery.",Dizzy In Lancu
