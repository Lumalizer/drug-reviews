1,Diltiazem,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,3,,"July 14, 2017",3,"I have been on this drug 3 weeks, my reflux has been getting worse. I am back to Dr on Monday , I think I will need to go back to cardiologist as I am missing my left coronary artery and only have my right one for supporting me. I had been getting chest pain and after the angiogram I was started on this. Thankfully I do not have any blockage but need to protect the one artery that I have.",Redhead40
2,Diltiazem,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 15, 2015",17,"I'm 31 years old and have started having high blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide didn't work. After seeing the cardiologist I started  dilitiazem 24hr er 120mg cap for high blood pressure and angina. I feel like I worked instantly, on my third dose I checked my blood pressure and in was lower, it was still at risk, but it was much lower, and my pulse was normal. I do feel slightly dizzy for a split second. I don't feel tired and I drive all day with it. I have had a loss of appetite, but I think that's a good thing so I can get this weight off. I'm using this medicine along with diet and slow pace exercise. This is day four and I still have a slight chest pain for a second once or twice a day, but I know its working because I feel better.",JadaVA
