0,Isosorbide,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 22, 2022",1,"I have been taking isosorbide mononitrate for over a year now for stable angina pectoris.  I take it at 10 A.M. in the morning rather than when I get up, which works best for me because it's effect only lasts 9 hours for me, and If I take it too early, I have a severe rebound period beginning at about the 9 hour mark... eating the evening meal at 6 P.M. causes hard angina attack if I am in the rebound period.  In my rebound period, walking 50-60 feet or any similar activity brings on an attack and I have to take one .4mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablet as a minimum, and If I don't catch it early two or three nitro tabs.  My rebound period is most problematic from about 9 hours to 14 hours after taking the drug.  In the mornings after resting overnight, I'm good.",cebtoo
1,Isosorbide,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 15, 2020",17,I've been taking Isosorbide 30 mg ER dose 3 times a day for years to help angina.  I also have a pacemaker.  No headaches and I feel better than I did before this medicine was prescribed by my cardiologist.,Donaldw4
2,Isosorbide,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 3, 2019",25,Jackson.  My Dr put me on 30 mg and I had a killer headache all night so I wasn't going to take again but broke the tablet in half and took it.  I still had a small headache.  I suggest slowly increasing isosorbide until your body  adjusts to it and then continue increasing until you reach the desired dose the dr wants you on.  I told my cardiologist and he said that was ok..just a suggestion - you probably should check with your Doctor and see what they think.,Sue

5,Isosorbide,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,9.0,,"March 28, 2017",24,"My GP suspected (and after pressure wire Angiogram) I was diagnosed with Variant (Prinzmetal) Angina. I have been taking Isosorbide Mononitrate 30mg successfully for a year. The headaches were awful at first but by ""titrating"" the (strictly once a day) dose (that is gradually increasing it to the prescribed strength over a period of a couple of months) the side effects were minimised. My GP was helpful in this regard by selecting tablets that could be halved; quartered; and of lower strength than the target dose, while working up to the full dose. The frequency episodes of chest pain have reduced from almost daily to about 1 day in 10 and the intensity of pain reduced from excruciating to quite mild.",PeterRG
6,Isosorbide,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,1.0,,"February 19, 2017",31,"Imdur (isosorbide mononitrate):Took half dose, 15 mg, and spent two days feeling terrible. It caused chest and back pain, shortness of breath, confusion, dizziness, anxiety, and a general really sick feeling. It did relieve angina but it was not worth the side effects. Really bad medicine.",NCDavid

16,Isosorbide,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,,,"February 16, 2012",48,"This was given for angina after by-pass for coronary artery disease. I also have a disease called Raynaud Disease which causes spasm, pain and cold hands and feet. When the hands spasm, they are cold, asleep and very painful. First white, then blue and red with the return of blood flow. You spend your time trying to get the blood flow to return, heat, movement of hands. With isosorbride I can live without the pain and spasms. Thank you for this medicine.",nlhutson
17,Isosorbide,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,7.0,,"July 4, 2011",82,"My doctor prescribed this medicine due to on-going chest pain. I have now been taking it for 1 week and have a headache everyday. Nothing seems to help stop them. I have taken aspirin, Tylenol and even acetaminophen with codeine for relief and so far none have worked. The headache is constant throughout the day and is throbbing and causes dizziness. The good side is the chest pain has gone away. I'm considering stopping this medicine as the headaches are pretty bad.",marklvnv
18,Isosorbide,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,10.0,,"June 14, 2010",153,Imdur (isosorbide mononitrate):I was put on this medication along with a very low dose ACE inhibitor that controls my blood pressure. The Imdur ER is being used to alleviate my chest pain and it has done so completely. I have not have one single flair up at all since starting it! The only down fall is the headache that I have had. I am going to call my cardiologist today to see if I can take anything for that. I still give it a 10 even with the headache because the chest pain was worse than the headache!,nattlee
