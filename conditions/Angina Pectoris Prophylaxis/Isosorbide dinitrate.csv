0,Isosorbide dinitrate,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 15, 2014",9,"Prior to this medication, I was depending on Nitro exclusively for Angina occurrence, with good results; I now take Isosorbide Dinatrate 10 mg three times daily with very little results, that I can determine. After every pill, I get angina in 1-2 hrs and this lasts until my next dosage. I don't think this medicine is appropriate for me.",olbugga
