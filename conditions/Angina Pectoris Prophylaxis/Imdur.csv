0,Imdur,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,1,,"February 19, 2017",31,"Took half dose, 15 mg, and spent two days feeling terrible. It caused chest and back pain, shortness of breath, confusion, dizziness, anxiety, and a general really sick feeling. It did relieve angina but it was not worth the side effects. Really bad medicine.",NCDavid

3,Imdur,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,1,,"November 3, 2015",53,"I had chest pain and palpitations. Was prescribed Imdur and took 1 tablet. That was the worst 3 days of my life. I prefer the angina to the ""cure."" Caused nausea, vomiting, intense pain (felt like my body was made of broken glass), every sound went right thru me, and every noise was excruciating. Never again.",Sonny Beach
4,Imdur,Angina Pectoris Prophylaxis,10,,"June 14, 2010",153,I was put on this medication along with a very low dose ACE inhibitor that controls my blood pressure. The Imdur ER is being used to alleviate my chest pain and it has done so completely. I have not have one single flair up at all since starting it! The only down fall is the headache that I have had. I am going to call my cardiologist today to see if I can take anything for that. I still give it a 10 even with the headache because the chest pain was worse than the headache!,nattlee
