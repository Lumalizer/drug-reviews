0,Testosterone,Klinefelter Syndrome,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 8, 2021",0,I had to resort to injections I was diagnosed with kleinfelter syndrome at age of 13 back then I had health insurance as years went by I got more tired. I had no energy my libido declined and thoughts of sex did not appeal to me. I am on monthly injections of testosterone. This is my 1st month. I have to say my libido has gone up and as a kid I could not control having hard ons and now as an older adult I am having the same problem. On a good note it strengthens my relationship with my significant other on a bad note I can not control my erections it comes more than it goes. Hard to sleep with an erection. Sleep comes when it wants. My episodes of staying hard are more frequent. Part of me is scared the other part is happy,Dan
1,Testosterone,Klinefelter Syndrome,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 12, 2016",10,"I've taken testosterone in various different forms since I was 18, and the worst form was the implants as my body rejected them, twice, so I gave up on that method. Recently the manufacturers of Andriol have advised production of Andriol was going to be delayed and New Zealand won't be restocked until September 2016.  Not wishing to go back to injections I determined to trial Androderm patch, and I wish I'd done it years ago.   My skin has no reaction to this patch.  It delivers a good level of testosterone based on how I feel, I've not had any blood tests to back that opinion up.  However; on Andriol I don't experience morning erections very often, but with the patch I do, regularly. Shaving has also gone back to normal.",XXYGuy
