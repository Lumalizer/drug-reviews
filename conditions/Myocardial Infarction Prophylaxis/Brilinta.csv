0,Brilinta,Myocardial Infarction Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 26, 2021",2,"Took this 3 days post LAD stent while on chronic pain managment for spinal cord damage & 11 fusions. This was a nightmare of severe shortness of breath, bodily waves of feeling of drowning in pain, pounding, racing heart, exhaustion, elevated blood pressure, dizziness, nausea! Will never take this again, ever!!!",Renee
1,Brilinta,Myocardial Infarction Prophylaxis,1,,"September 12, 2020",9,I had a stent put in my 90%  blocked left lower descending artery.  I was given Brilinta in the hospital but was also on oxygen.  When I went home and took my first dose upon arrival it was a nightmare.  I couldnâ€™t seem to catch my breath.  I panicked  more than  I ever have in my entire life.  I sat up all night until it began to wear off.  I shook like a leaf.  I never want to feel like that again.  My doctor  put me on Prasugrel just once a day.  I am so much better and so relieved!,Tracy
2,Brilinta,Myocardial Infarction Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 13, 2020",6,"I had a  stent inserted in the right artery. I was on plavix (clopidogrel) for 4 months but wanted to try something else because the plavix was giving me tension and pressure in my head.  So I tried Brilinta, and I only lasted 20 days.  From day one I was getting muscle twitches and pains in odd areas that came and went.  I also felt jittery all 20 days on Brilinta  The final days on Brilinta gave me minor chest pains, a cough and was giving me mild anxiety attacks.So I called my Doctor and I will be going back to clopidogrel until I get brave enough to try something different different.Don't let anyone try to convince you that these drugs do not give you or exacerbate anxiety, they do. I have never had anxiety attacks in my 57 years of life, until I started taking some of these medicines like Brilinta, losartan, olmesartan.  I presently take 25 mg of metoprolol and it is working and controls my pulse to prevent an anxiety attack from getting worse. ",BW
