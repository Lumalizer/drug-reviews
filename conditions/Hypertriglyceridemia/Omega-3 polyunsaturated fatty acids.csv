Since then I have changed my diet significantly (lower carb and calorie counting).  Lost 16 pounds so far, and exercise 5x/week.  Has my trigs tested again this week and went down to 179.

I don't know which aspect of my changes (the meds, diet, exercise) had the most impact on getting my trigs down, but  am happy with where they are going.    My terrible insurance company would not even pay for it, so I am using the generic version - $50/month.",nobody102
