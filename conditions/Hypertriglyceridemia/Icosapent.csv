For fish oil.  I almost felt bad for my health insurance co. Almost.  I've been taking this Gucci fish oil for two years and my cholesterol has barely budged. A little research seems to show only two studies that were paid for by Amerin that show good results in a very carefully selected group of people.  I'm done with Vascepa.

Not able to exercise effectively due to back pain from car crash. Also have high alt and AST from taking prednisone to shrink post radiation tumor. So very high triglycerides came down a some points into 300's after 4 months. So in January 2021, I had my gallbladder removed via laparoscopic procedure.  I kept taking Vascepa same dosage 2 pills with first meal and 2 pills with dinner.  Then I developed type II diabetes.  Now in September 2021, my triglycerides increased to 600's.

I can now barely function during the day the pain is so bad and I wake up in the middle of the night numerous times to use the bathroom. My knee joints now crackle every time I sit down. Right arm from elbow to wrist is swollen and I can no longer make a fist. I only took this medication for 6-8 weeks and had to stop because it felt like a cinderblock on my chest. I used to be able to take walks and ride a stationary bike. I can no longer do either. I am now doing a liver cleanse to try and get this stuff out of my body.

I tried a small dose of Vascepa for 3 months with no side effects.  But there was no change in my triglyceride levels.   I was then bumped up to 2 grams twice a day.  After 35 days the side effects hit me.  Diarrhea, severe muscle pain in my legs, ribs and gout flared up.  This all started the cycle of side effects.  Now experiencing PVC's and dizziness and light headed.  Had to go to the ER for the PVC's.  Once I stopped the medication the side effects have diminished, PVC's are less frequent, but now I have the urge to pee every 5 minutes along with the dizziness.  I experienced just about every side effect possible on this drug.  I don't wish these side effects on anyone.  I hope the drug works for you.",pgchili

Took the Vascepa for 2 weeks and experienced terrible muscular pains similar to that from statins (although doc says the two drugs don't work the same). Then discovered at several medical sites with authority  that Vacepa works when taken alongside special diet and exercise programs. Also takes 5 years to see any beneficial results equal to the original research numbers.

Also problems as others mentioned such as heart beating faster, severe gastrointestinal issues, joint pain and heart burn. Other issues I had were hair loss and my nails started to crack and virtually stop growing and my skin aged quickly. I tried Vascepa for around 9 months at half dose (2 a day instead of 4). I wonder how bad my situation would have been at full dose! Since stopping, virtually all symptoms went away, even nail issue. Hoping my hair will return. Would NOT recommend this drug.

It would wake me up at night - hips, ankles, shoulders - a different area every night. I had started at four a day - then I discovered it gave me terrible bad breath to the point people backed away from me. So I cut back to two at night. Two years on this med an in the beginning joint pain was never mentioned as a side effect, now they are mentioning it on the website. I stopped taking it 3 nights ago.

Also, developed a progressive problem with shortness of breath which started mildly which grew severe.  Decided to review Vascepa side effects since it was the only drug added to my normal regime of meds.   Appears ""gouty arthritis"" and SOB is listed as a patient side effect.  I've discontinued use.  The plasma 1/2 life of Vascepa is 89 hours so it remains in the blood extremely long and is not excreted thru the kidneys.

Mentioned to my cardiologist that my newest med was vascepa but he did not think anything of it.  So. Two ER visits later, I looked vascepa up and saw that a small percentage of patients had these side effects.  I stopped taking them on my own and messaged my doctor that I stopped.

I actually feel more energized , I have also made a diet change to a more organic vegetable food source .

As I am on polypharmacy due to various unrelated conditions and many meds in my daily regimen duplicate, interact, enhance or all three, the many side effects associated, my physicians and I are hard-pressed to attribute the cause of most of my discomfort. Recently I  developed terrible ankle pain (bilaterally upon flexion). Another review contributor here voiced the identical issue along with foci of seemingly arbitrary intense deep muscle pain (for me, this is in the right quadricept). Stopping all meds and reintroducing them in turn is not an option for me. Additionally, MDs are no longer trained in full; rather, specialty is rife with the lack of scope that results. As I don't feel that Vascepa is of singular need for my life and health, I shall share my thoughts with my PCP and then wean myself off this med with care.",Osler

Moreover, Express Scripts won't take the medication back after 60 days -- even though they fill the prescription for 90 days. On top of all that, I don't think Vascepa has done my triglycerides much good. And that's not even taking into consideration all the side effects people describe here.
