3,Fentanyl,Anesthesia,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 13, 2016",5,Was administered fentanyl during endoscopy and stopped breathing once during procedure and once in recovery.  Still woozy two days after having had fentanyl; also perspire after any mild exertion.  The drug seems to  not agree with me at all; better to go through the rages after Demerol.,yenaika

5,Fentanyl,Anesthesia,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 29, 2014",7,"The patches wore out usually in 24 hours or less. I would go into withdrawal symptoms prior to the next patch. I had very bad thoughts, pain, shakes and severe breathing problems which seemed to be a side effect. Not a good experience, I am trying to go cold turkey to get off it. I felt way better on 3-4 Vicodin than 75 mg release fentanyl.",IRONMAN55
6,Fentanyl,Anesthesia,10.0,,"February 12, 2012",22,I have had this medicine when I have had colonoscopies and endoscopies. Also when I had two total knee replacements. It is awesome and causes me absolutely no problem. Keeps a person comfortable and I have had no addictive reactions to it.,Anonymous
