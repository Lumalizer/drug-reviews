0,Hyoscyamine,Anesthesia,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 5, 2021",5,With my insurance cover  I only pay 3 dollars for it. I have upper stomach pain I had a CT scan done I go back to the doctor on April the 6th to get my results. But I called in for something for pain and she gave me this. I did notice I use to go the the bathroom a lot  now I don't go as often to pee so I thank God for that. I'm still in pain but sometimes it let up a little. I will be glad when this is over.,lisa
