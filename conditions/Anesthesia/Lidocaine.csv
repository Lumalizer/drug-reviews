0,Lidocaine,Anesthesia,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 13, 2022",2,"Relative was administered lidocaine as local anesthesia, started having seizures and died. We are still trying to determine what happened.",She died
1,Lidocaine,Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 13, 2021",0,"Since I was 10 years old I've been experiencing adverse responses to lidocaine when injected. Typically I become hypotensive and pass out. Sometimes I have seizures. What I have found is that providers are skeptical of this sensitivity / hypersensitivity I have to lidocaine. Once again, this week I had a neurologist inject 2% lidocaine into the trapezius muscle. Of note I have a high pain tolerance and I'm not afraid of needles. Once again I became dizzy, nauseous, hypotensive, and passed out. I wish I can convey to providers that I truly have the sensitivity and that lidocaine isn't always a benign drug.",ZenAmberBliss
2,Lidocaine,Anesthesia,,,"August 8, 2021",0,Lidocaine patches are the worst ever. They will not stay on their cheap plastic they can't even deliver what they're supposed to. I would give them a 0/10 if I could,Dan
3,Lidocaine,Anesthesia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 2, 2021",0,For as much money as the lidocaine patches cost I am surprised that adhesive is not better the patches hardly stick out all and need to be taped on,Lidocaine patches
4,Lidocaine,Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 4, 2021",2,"I had lidocaine given as a nerve block to see if radio frequency ablation will work. I have a lot of nerve and muscle pain down in my sacroiliac spine and mid back is tender to the touch and it affects my ribs. Anyway, they sedated me and did the injection. When I woke up, I was supposed to feel a lot better but apart from being slightly numb in one side (left, if it matters), everything else in my back was painfully stiff. It got worse as the lidocaine wore off and it has been days and it flared my whole body into some kind of immune response because my legs are weak and tingling and my arms are weak and there are muscles forcibly flexed and hot to the touch in my forearms. This is so weird that I just want to warn people out there to think before you get the seemingly innocuous injection.",GarenMS
5,Lidocaine,Anesthesia,1.0,,"December 26, 2020",4,"Lidocaine was injected to remove a suspect mole on my arm. Within minutes I had uncontrollable tremors  from mid chest radiating to my legs. I realized  that over the years I had experienced this reaction during prior procedures  when administered this drug. ( ie: dental)  The severity of the reaction has been cumulative with the last 2 being the most severe and frightening. My GP believes itâ€™s a neurological  response rather than classic allergy. There are 2 groups of local anesthetic Amides  and Ester. Lidocaine is an Amide .  My dentist, ophthalmologist and dermatologist take my history seriously and do not use drugs from the Amides group. I seem to do find on Esters.",Tad
6,Lidocaine,Anesthesia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 30, 2020",7,"Lidocaine is mixed with epinephrine, and it's the epinephrine which is causing many people's reactions.  Epinephrine speeds up heart rate.  Lidocaine is available without epinephrine.  The effect of epinephrine on the patient allows medical personnel to avoid using too much lidocaine, since epinephrine side effects are detectable.",None
7,Lidocaine,Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 12, 2019",7,"I had terrible adverse reactions from Lidocaine after several dentist visits. Every time I received a Lidocaine injection it felt like I was having a heart attack (it was actually SEVERE heart palpitations), made me feel cold, and at one point triggered a minor seizure. I also have epilepsy so it is very possible that Lidocaine is not recommended for anyone with serious conditions (but my dentists kept using it anyway). Be careful if you are considering using Lidocaine as a local anesthetic.",CM
8,Lidocaine,Anesthesia,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 10, 2018",3,"L-Caine (lidocaine):Not a great deal of relief in both lumber spine,hips and legs also the problems have at levels C6,C7 much the same.Side effects great loss of bowel control, not nice.",YAHOO
9,Lidocaine,Anesthesia,,,"March 1, 2018",8,"I have used 5% lidocaine patches for sciatica and bursitis in my thighs. I can usually sit only for 10 to 15 minutes before the pain becomes unbearable. A patch takes about 5 minutes to completely relieve the pain for the day. That problem has cleared but now I have a broken leg requiring a lot of sitting and lying down. The pain is back when I sit but now my insurance, United Health Care, has denied approval to use it so I could only sit when I had to for the last 4 weeks, otherwise stand or lie down. Wheel chairs can't be used for longer than 10 to 15 minutes at a time. The 5% patches are great if you can get them.",Acon
10,Lidocaine,Anesthesia,10.0,,"April 3, 2017",2,I used this after having a tooth pulled - it caused nausea ,andrewbrad
11,Lidocaine,Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 10, 2016",20,"I now wear a medal alert bracelet because no one believes I'm allergic to lidocaine and they give it to me anyway.  My last experience with MOHS surgery, I immediately passed into a deep sleep and then out, I felt like I couldn't move.  It didn't last long.  First time didn't get it so they had to give me more.  I passed out again but my chest hurt and it was hard to breathe.  No one really checked on me.  My husband was with me.  Third time I passed out and my chest really hurt and I had trouble breathing.  Chest pain lasted a couple of weeks.  I'm 58 and I do not want to die from this stuff.  Doctors do not believe me.  They say I just get drunk.  I was more than drunk.",Longhorntiger
12,Lidocaine,Anesthesia,,,"January 23, 2016",3,I had an injection as a test to see if another RFA would be warranted.  It's been 1 1/2 months and the burning is ALMOST gone. Muscle pain....other pain exists but the burning has lessened so much!  I'm considering an infusion...or wait and see if I can get another injection into the nerves affected...???  Any words appreciated. Thanks. Also they keep doing clinical  trials I see online but with no results (for infusion).  Why is that?  Why can't we know what the risks and benefits of the trials are?  Who is doing these and what results do they have?,msjan
13,Lidocaine,Anesthesia,3.0,,"January 21, 2014",14,"Use of lidocaine injection to numb insertion sight for IV resulted in burning sensation in the vein that traveled to the heart in 10-15 seconds. This was followed by pale skin, cold sweat, BPdrop and unconciousness for approx.15 minutes.  I feel usage in my case was unnecessary, dangerous, andinaffective as it had worn of by the time IV was inserted.",reclus1
