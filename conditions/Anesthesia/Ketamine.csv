0,Ketamine,Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2022",2,"I was anesthetized with ketamine for a minor short duration laparoscopic surgery and was to go home right afterward.  This was before it was first taken off the register as a human anesthetic.  When I ""woke up"" in the recovery room I was drastically ill, vomiting etc. and was not coherent enough to be released.  I had to be admitted to the hospital as an inpatient.  I could not see or hear anything and as far as I knew I was completely alone.  I thought I was dead.  I was sure that I had died in the operating room.  I thought that I was in Hell, and that Hell was being aware forever with absolutely no sensory input.  I was terrified and remained in this state for the entire night.  I do not understand why this drug has been reinstated for human use.  I have had several surgeries in the years since, with other more mainstream anesthetics with no problems; I wake up quickly, completely alert and oriented.  Ketamine should be banned.",Neveragain
1,Ketamine,Anesthesia,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2022",0,"I had ketamine when I had my first cataract surgery in 2020. I did not like it at all. I woke during surgery not knowing where I was or what was happening to me, I could hear voices and knew something was happening to my eye but did not know what it was, only that I either couldn’t it shouldn’t move, I could see vivid colours pinks and greens were the ones I remember the most, I could feel a liquid washing over my eye, I tried to move my hands slightly, which I think I did. Then I heard a voice say, ok you are finished you can sit up now, they asked me to stand and sat me in a wheelchair, and took me to recovery. I said I did not like that at all I felt like I was tripping, a very odd experience I didn’t want to repeat. Next week I had the other eye done and asked for a different anaesthetic. I had another younger Anaesthetist this time and he said, yes we won’t give you ketamine there’s better anaesthetics than that. We’ll put you out this time.",Rob
2,Ketamine,Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2022",0,Went to ER for rectal abscess. Was given ketamine 50 mg as anesthesia. My wife was wearing glasses and mask and all of a sudden she was cartoon like. Like a picture 1 dimensional. The room was white with a beautiful mural of lake and forest. It bled out to white. Intense white. My wife staring at me with a mask was so intense. Couldn’t tell any facial features because of mask. Felt helpless and dramatic and so intense. Feeling of gloom and doom. I knew I was dying. Was waiting for moment of severe pain and then death. Came down ok. But have PTSD now been 6 days. Can’t get rid of thoughts. Will not ever take this drug again,Cartoon like
3,Ketamine,Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2021",0,"This is for Shabby_chick, I also was administered ketamine as an anesthetic with the same results. You described what I went through to a capital T. Problem is I had another surgery-on my foot- with a different anesthetic and experienced the same horror. I was awake and aware of everything going on in the O.R. I even tried concentrating on moving one finger to let them know I wasn't ""under"". The worst thing for me both times is being incubated and having a respirator breathing for me when I probably would have been hyperventilating. During that surgery I finally passed out from fright when the surgeon called for the bone saw and I heard it whirring. Yes haunted for life, you bet.",Melwie

5,Ketamine,Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 25, 2021",4,"I dislocated my elbow playing football. They needed to put me to sleep in order to relocate it. I was familiar with General Anesthesia having had my wisdom tooth removal not too long before, so I wasn't scared or nervous too much. But this drug ketamine, holy moly it was possibly worse than the pain I experienced from the dislocation itself. After being administered the drug, I remember thinking to myself I had actually died, and what I saw is pretty hard to explain but I was floating away from my consciousness, with both my mom and dad looking over my body. After that I kept coming in and out of consciousness. It looked as if I flying through neurons in my brain, zooming closer, further, and all around them. That wasn't even the worst part about that drug, when I finally woke up, I had the worst vertigo EVER. Anytime I would move my head a little bit to the left or right, I would feel nauseous and throw up. Worst nightmare of my life, would not recommend.",Stephen
6,Ketamine,Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 24, 2021",2,"Worst experience ever. I was flagged for propofol incorrectly, so they used ketamine. It was used to put me to sleep while removing a kidney stone through my male part. When I woke up, it was as if I was a scene from the Matrix, all digitized. I never felt so horrified and dread but I do not know why. The nurses said I was hallucinating badly. When I did become conscious and recognized someone, I apparently said, ""you're real. Don't leave me"" and kept repeating it. I still remember the recovery as terrifying but why, I cannot recall.",Jack
7,Ketamine,Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 18, 2021",7,"Please DO NOT USE THIS DRUG!!!!! I had a c-section (CSE) in March of 2016. On top of the morphine and fentanyl I had already been administered the anethesist made the worse decision ever and administered not one but two doses of Ketamine 11 minutes and 8 minutes before the birth of my son. Everything went black, I don't recall anything till the next day. I was so out of it that I didn't even text my family to tell them the baby was born. However, things just got even worse because the Ketamine transfered through the placenta in less than 2 minutes and 80% was absorbed by my beautiful baby. My son essentially got 10X the dose, he literally overdosed. My son is now severely disabled and requires 24/7 care. This drug literally altered the mechanism of his little brain. Please do NOT USE!!!!",Ashleigh
8,Ketamine,Anesthesia,1.0,,"August 4, 2021",5,"I was given ketamine for a nerve ablation in my lumbar spine and had horrific hallucinations, not sure if I felt pain and screamed out or was dreaming but I remember the Dr saying that's not supposed to happen and could hear the nurses talking. It took me forever to ""wake up"". The nurse felt I was given too much as I was so dizzy and numb, my eyeballs felt like balloons about to pop out of my head, my head felt like a heavy balloon my neck couldn't support and could barely talk an hour later. I spent over an hour and a half in recovery when they had to finally let me go. My husband had to support me I was so dizzy and my legs were like noodles. It has been days now and I feel like crud. Can't concentrate, my entire body aches so bad and the dreams, no, the nightmares - planes crashing around the house, house being burned down, being hunted by gang or some sort of bad people then I'm so freaked out I can't sleep and depression. I feel so depressed and I have never felt like this before.",JRJAMJ
9,Ketamine,Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 20, 2021",4,"I was having a lot of anxiety prior to having a c-section. I had already been given an epidural. The anesthesiologist gave me something that he said would calm my nerves and everything instantly went black. I remember it all. It felt like I was falling down a pitch black hole and I can remember fighting to get back to my c-section. I thought I had died. I remember having stopped breathing and fighting to get a breath. When I finally came to I was being stitch up from my tubal and c-section so I have no idea how long I was actually out. I kept trying to ask the nurse if I was alive and okay and where my baby was but I kept going right back out. My fiancé said my eyes were open the whole time, but I was unresponsive and just kept saying ahh. He said the baby came out blue and had to be put on oxygen. It was the most terrifying thing I’ve ever experienced. It’s 16 months later and I’m just now finding out that’s what I was put on because it’s in my child’s doctor notes.",Cesarean and afraid
10,Ketamine,Anesthesia,1.0,,"May 2, 2021",6,"Cardio version Dr. said this was the only drug they could give me because my blood pressure was low!When administered immediately went out. There was a loud siren to begin with no wailing. Then there was siren wailing. I saw pictures, like a tv screen, the picture would begin at the bottom and explode at the top and I would begin again at the bottomI felt as if I died with the explosion (the end of the picture)and born at the the beginning of the new photo The screen / photo and the sound would crescendo at the explosion The explosion was a bright lightScreen after screen sometimes a plant or building or person, siren after siren, life to death, over and over, I tried to stop myself from waking up!

11,Ketamine,Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 28, 2021",21,"I agree with those of you that had a horrific, haunting experience from ketamine in Jan 2021. It was the worst experience of my life. I received it in an ambulance when they had to reset my dislocated ankle. It separates your mind from your body but your thinking is still lucid. I was trapped in a never ending tunnel that was spinning and I was endlessly falling with a tortuous loud, fluttery ringing in my ears that was driving me crazy. ""I remember thinking, so this is death, I must not have survived the fall and I have to be like this for eternity"". The gut wrenching sadness of knowing that I was dead was overwhelming and I was upset I didn't get to say goodbye to my children. Then when I was waking up, I would answer questions. My mouth moved but it took a few seconds for the sound of my words to catch up. I still get very upset just thinking about it but the Drs just laughed it off. The relief to find out I had not died was indescribable.",Lobo
12,Ketamine,Anesthesia,10.0,,"April 26, 2021",5,"First I want to say I am so sorry to anyone that has posted a traumatic experience from this drug and that are still living in fear. Please seek a trauma therapist so that you can process what happened and get some normal back in your life. There is hope and it is possible. I had a similar experience with zoloft that left me traumatized and gave me PTSD. After a year therapy I am doing much better. As far as my experience with Ketamine. It was good. Surgery went well and I have no memory of it. However, I know I was given propranolol and versed first... maybe that makes a difference. I am unsure if any of you had just straight Ketamine. This is something I would recommend asking before any surgery is what types will be given and possible side effects so you can be in control of an informed decision. Good luck to all of you out there with trauma!",Jess

15,Ketamine,Anesthesia,1.0,,"March 2, 2021",29,"This is really hard for me to tell this : On February 25th 2021, I went to the hospital emergency room with severe stomach pain. They took me straight back to a room, I tell the nurse that I'm allergic to morphine and I'm also allergic to the Valium, I specifically said to the nurse that I do not want any high narcotics, she injected some type of medication into my IV that sent me straight into a nightmare state, I remember seeing a black and white psychedelic light I remember laying on the table and watching doctors cut me open I watch people with weird faces screaming and yelling at me.  I have seen people eating other people I remember seeing a cross of Jesus and asking Jesus to save me from the depth of this nightmare, I went through so many stages of unpleasantness on this drug, now I can't sleep because every time I close my eyes I see the same thing over and over again.

I felt like I was in a kaleidoscope, I felt like I was dying and I couldn't breathe, I said to myself if this is dying then please let it be over. When I came out of it I told the physician's assistant how scary it was and he said do not let anyone give it to me again. Of course no one says anything to you before they administer it to you about the possible side effects.",Samantha
18,Ketamine,Anesthesia,1.0,,"January 14, 2021",86,"I pondered whether I should even post this or not, because it sounds so unbelievable, but it really did happened. I had my medi-port placed on January 11th. For some reason, this particular anesthesiologist used the drug Ketamine to put me to sleep. (Which I found out later) The only problem, is that I wasn’t really asleep. I was paralyzed. No matter how much I tried screaming for help, I couldn’t. I began to see things very differently too. Almost like I was in a kaleidoscope, or looking at it in 3-D. I could hear and see the nurses and doctors around me, but they all looked upside down. ￼It’s as if I wasn’t in my own body. It’s like I stuck in some tunnel. There were so many colors too. I felt as though I was dying, and there was nothing I could do about it. It absolutely was the most horrifying experience I’ve ever had. Has anyone else experienced this ?? I’m just trying find answers as to what happened. It will haunt me the rest of my life.",Shabby_Chick

Was actually supposed to go home yesterday after a routine arthroscope of knee. I woke up from the procedure with Hallucinations and screaming the ""I AM DYING, I AM DYING"".

Was told I'd be receiving ketamine to put me under. Reading the experiences here by others appear to be in stark contrast to mine as I rather enjoyed the technicolor dream state I was in.

22,Ketamine,Anesthesia,1.0,,"May 6, 2020",42,"I dislocated my elbow & went to ER. They decided to give me something to put me lightly to sleep but not totally under while adjusting my elbow. They chose ketamine since I have low blood pressure & this drug doesn’t lower blood pressure as much as other options. They said I would remember nothing. Hardly! Such a terrible experience. As soon as it was administered I felt a rush of heat through my body, then felt as if I was in a kaleidoscope, only all white. I was in space while various shapes continued to change & fall around me. I heard many voices all at once. I was in another dimension & thought that I had died. I wondered if this was eternity & I could not escape. I wanted it all to stop so badly as my perceptions just continually changed around me. I finally heard the doctors/nurses talking amongst themselves & felt gauze being wrapped around my elbow.

The Anesthesia team decided to do an awake intubation because I have a difficult airway.  They said they were giving me something to help me relax.  What happened next was the farthest thing from relaxing I can imagine.  One dose of Ketamine and I was hallucinating, dissociated, delirious, paralyzed, and the one trace of lucidity that I retained told me that I was end of life because I couldn't breathe. I had no sense of time passing, so I have no idea how long this lasted.   It was the most terrifyingly awful experience I have ever had, and I'm still an emotional mess two weeks later.
