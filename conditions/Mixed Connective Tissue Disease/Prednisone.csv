0,Prednisone,Mixed Connective Tissue Disease,9,,"April 9, 2017",8,"Back in the mid eighties I started to get some sort of odd inflammation they thought several different diseases because from time to time I test positive for them then negative. First Lyme's , then systemic lupus, then gout, then possible bone cancer, etc etc.. the list is huge and has baffled a lot of different doctors which have sent me to all the best clinics the last time was Neuromyelitus when I started to go blind and seizures.. when the flare up eventually got so bad  in the nineties that I was mottled and four times the normal size and bed bound not being able to walk at all..the big problem is it floats and affects random joints and organs . I have to . What seems to help the most is Prednisone",OneDusty
1,Prednisone,Mixed Connective Tissue Disease,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 18, 2016",9,"Swelling severe joint pain especially wrists leaving me unable to use my hands. Dr prescribed prednisolone 20 mgs to start ,within 1 hour my pain was gone and next day swelling had almost disappeared .  As I was on a long course I did suffer from being paranoid  and gained  over 3 stone  in weight , however I did realise  I had to bear with it to have any quality of life and it did work , for 5 years I had no more symptoms. Recently my pains and swellings are back only in my wrists this time doctors prescribed only short periods of the drug, I had no side affects but 3 days after finishing my wrists were screaming pain . I am 70 this year and otherwise have good health so I will have my way and use of my hands back by using this drug.",Litt

Take for shortest time possible. Will effect bone matrix breakdown in some cases. You might feel wonderful , but be rotting inside, without knowledge about some unusual but possible side effects.",JayRe514
