0,Iclusig,Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia,5,,"January 7, 2015",5,"I have used Gleevec, Sprycel and both the above mentioned with Hydrea added. Gleevec made me nauseous but it worked for a while, for about 1.5 years. I then was switched to Sprycel which didn't make me nauseated lasted 3/4 of the year. Now I'm talking Ponatinib which sometimes upset my stomach, but it was controlling the CML and the T315I mutation, did developed Thrombocythemia, in which Thrombocythemia is being difficult to control. But the CML was being kept at bay. This lasted for less than a year. I liked the Ponatinib little side effects and was controlling the CML and the mutation, but it caused the high platelets count. All medicines were great and I do recommend them in hopes to control the CML.",Kcir
