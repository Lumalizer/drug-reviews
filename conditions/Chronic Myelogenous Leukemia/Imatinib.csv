0,Imatinib,Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 2, 2021",1,"Gleevec (imatinib):I've been on Gleevec since 2007.  Nausea was mild initially, but bothersome.  Once I started to take it after the lunch meal, no nausea.I developed eye bleeds.  Naturalpath suggested grapeseed extract.  The supplement has prevented further eye bleeds.I did 3 trials of Gleevec cessation.  Each time BCR-ABL returned, each time sooner and higher percent of its' presence.  Gleevec was restarted.  During 3rd attempt, joint pain and swelling developed with a vengeance (tki - Tyrosine kinase inhibitor, withdrawal syndrome).  3 months after resuming Gleevec, symptoms persist.  Feels like I developed rheumatoid arthritis (this diagnosis ruled out by Rheumatologist). Prednisone helps the best, but the therapeutic dose raises my blood pressure.How are others with lingering tki withdrawal syndrome managing the symptoms?  Any recommended reading for trial Gleevec cessation protocols?",Marie
1,Imatinib,Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 24, 2018",11,"Gleevec (imatinib):Started  Gleevec at 400 mg Feb 2017. Due to the numerous side affects (think I have them all) it was reduced until finally stopped. In late February 2018 as my body and mind were in bad shape. Had to give up physical therapy as body now too weak. What is scary, as of 6/24/18, still have all of the side affects.Blood reports getting worse. No relief in sight. New sores still showing up-takes months to heal. Still sleep in a stuffed chair due to constantly being awakened for trips to bathroom to medicate/treat something. Guest bath looks like a pharmacy with pills, powders, creams and bandages-most of them Dr ordered or recommended. Have not gotten 3 straight hours of sleep in months-has not happened this year. I sense Dr's being frustrated-if pill has stopped, why hasn't side affects?",nate

3,Imatinib,Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 2, 2016",8,"Praise God for Gleevec/Imatinib.  Discovered the CML in early 2005.  Immediately went on Gleevec 800mg daily.  After a few months, I changed doctors, went to 600mg and many side effects began to ease up.  Over the years we've tried Spricel and another drug but side effects worsened so we are back with Imatinib 600mg.  With the exception of diarrhea, bloating and fluid retention, all is great.  Am into my second month on the generic Imatinib so we'll see.Again, just so thankful for Meds which control the CML and the doctors who developed it.",ronlin425
4,Imatinib,Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 2, 2016",11,"Gleevec (imatinib):The drug has been effective but since Medicare coverage changed this year the out of pocket expense of $2k / month makes it not affordable.  The best hope was the copay program offered by Novartis but since I have a Part D plan (as bad as it is) I do not qualify for that.  Oh well, I had a good run.  Hopeful that it somehow stays in remission, but if not hopeful that it does not drag out.",Anonymous
5,Imatinib,Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 25, 2015",17,Gleevec (imatinib):I have been on Gleevec for a year now. I started with 400mg but could not tolerate it so dropped to 300mg. I am in remission but nausea has become a problem. Taking antinausea meds but still nauseated most of the day. Lorazepam helps but wish I felt better without all of this. Glad to be alive though.,Cali48

I threw up almost every night on it. I had a rash all over my body when I first took it but that went away over time. Gleevec stopped working for me and my BNR jumped from 3 to 19.

8,Imatinib,Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia,10.0,,"October 29, 2013",16,"I have been on Gleevec since March 2007 when I was dignosed with Chronic Mylogenous Leukemia. I was sick for about 4 months on this drug with Nausea, leg swelling, pain so bad that I felt crippled by the end of every day and headaches. I had these symptoms even while taking Zofran with the drug.  My doctor's at MSKCC told me to hang in there saying I was going to wake up one day soon and feel better than ever. And then after 4 months, they were right. I remember that I woke up one morning, stretched my arms and legs and yawned and saw the sun shining through my bedroom window and I turned to my husband and said ""I feel great""!  I have pretty much felt great since then and my life has thrived.  I am not just a survivor, I am a thriver!",ToniQ
9,Imatinib,Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia,9.0,,"September 21, 2013",46,Gleevec (imatinib):I've been on Gleevec since Aug. 24 2001 for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia. I've had no side effects with it. The only side effect I had is when the doctor had me on both Gleevec and interferon it caused my heart function to drop. They took me off the interferon and heart function was normal. Been in remission for 11 years.,charlie jr
10,Imatinib,Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 22, 2013",61,"Gleevec (imatinib):I have been on Gleevec since 2/2006.  My white blood cell count went from 350,000 to 75,000 in less then three months.  I went into full moleculer remission by 2/2007.  Have the BCR-ABL blood test every 6 months and there is no more Philadelphia Chromosome since.  I still can get nauseated and once in a while vomit if I do not take my Reglan correctly or take Zofran with it, but that's a minor annoyance since this medicine saved my life.  I would have only had a 40% chance of survival if I would have had a bone marrow transplant.  This medicine is a 95% chance of survival and I'm just about to that magical mark of 10 years on the medicine.",CharliePupMom

I have been on Gleevec for about a year and a half now as Tasigna did not work for me.  I have had various side effects like others (i.e. swelling in the face, diarrhea, body sores, and muscle aches).  Thank heaven I did not lose my hair. The worst is the sores in my mouth that I cannot get rid of and the doctors do not find anything to give me any relief!  If I had to pay for the medicines myself I could not do it but with my wonderful insurance I am able to take the medicines and live a good life.  Otherwise I do not know where I would be without it.

13,Imatinib,Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia,3.0,,"November 22, 2012",26,"Gleevec (imatinib):I have been on Gleevec now for 6 months and in that time I have had maybe 5 well days, the other days have been filled with vomiting, nausea, body aches & pains, migraines, lethargy, insane amounts of facial swelling and my weight is just up & down like a yoyo, varying from 82kilos down to 75.  I now realize that when I said this wasn't the right medication for me 5 months ago I was right. Today my hematologist told me that my Philadelphia gene is unacceptably high, so now I am going to try something else. I am delighted to hear that others are doing so well on it but it certainly wasn't for me",chellyh

I do occasionally have those reactions, but very seldom.  I was told just recently I am in remission, it took 2 1/2 years.  The biggest down side is the cost.  I did not get upset learning about my leukemia, but cried when I found out about the cost.  I get help with my insurance and I am so thankful for PSI giving me some help with it as well.  ",Dina G

It has completely controlled my CML; my oncologist says that there isn't any sign of cancer now.  I have had complete remission.  I had just about all side effects the first month I was on this medicine, but they all stopped.  This is truly my miracle drug, a gift from GOD.  I recently had my quarterly check up, and my doctor told me there had been follow up studies done, and the people that came off Gleevec, had the CML return, so I guess that means you're on it for life.  The only downside is the cost, but thank God for my job and insurance, because it is covered.  I guess other than that it is no different than taking insulin for life, except the cost.",Anonymous

I did have some side-effects but prior to Gleevec, taking interferon and hydroxyurea led to much more severe side effects.  I had aching limbs, and I now have a skin reddening/rash--like rosacea on my cheeks and my upper arms are reddish--like a mild sunburn.  I have tummy issues now--gurgling, diarrhea, cramping, etc., but they are easily managed with imodium.  Gleevec has extended my survival and I had the honor of meeting Dr Druker who developed the drug, at Oregon Health and Science University.  He was absolutely wonderful as was the care I received there.",terriermom
