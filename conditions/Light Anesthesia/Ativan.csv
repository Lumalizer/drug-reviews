0,Ativan,Light Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 20, 2020",13,"I was prescribed 2mg Ativan to take 2 hours before a dentist appointment (Iâ€™m a 110 lb woman). I took it 2 hours prior and within a half hour, the whole room was spinning and I was getting nauseous. I was only not dizzy if I was laying down. It seemed like an impossible task to walk to the car and be driven to the dentist and endure an appointment in that state. I stayed home and immediately fell asleep for 5 hours. I felt nauseous upon waking and it got better after eating a small amount of bland food. It is not evening and I feel better, just very groggy and a little slow feeling. I would rather endure the dentist appointment than go through this again.",dizzy
