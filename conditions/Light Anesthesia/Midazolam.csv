0,Midazolam,Light Anesthesia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 9, 2022",0,"I received an injection through an IV drip port and I did and do not remember anything other than waking up. I was extremely off balanced and had to move very slowly or maybe that was the effect of the drug on my central nervous system. My body entire body felt heavy and difficult to move.  I did have an appetite but did not remember I had bought food to eat the day before my surgery. I tried to have PizzaHut delivery a pizza but the person taking the order was incompetent so I hung up.  I called Chopstix a great Thai food restaurant and ordered Pho soup with chicken. Took pain med Tylenol-codeine and amoxicillin with the soup. Became dizzy, sick on the stomach nauseated and began sweating profusely. Stopped eating and waited for all symptoms to subside. I hope I never have to take midazolam\versed again.",Warren

4,Midazolam,Light Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 22, 2021",0,"Yesterday was the second time I have been given midazolam as a sedative/light anaesthetic and it did not work for me either time. The first time was 3 years ago when I was having an angiogram - I was completely awake the whole time and felt the whole procedure, no drowsiness, no pain relief. The second time was yesterday for cataract surgery. I was given it intravenously, with two 'top ups' when they realised the first, then second lot didn't work. Was completely awake and felt quite a bit of the procedure. They eventually gave me an intravenous anaesthetic. Based on that, my next cataract surgery in a few weeks will be done using an intravenous anaesthetic. No more midazolam for me.",Marcelle

7,Midazolam,Light Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 6, 2021",1,"I had 75mg of fentanyl and 15mg of midazolam for a bronchoscopy. I had warned them that fentanyl has no effect on me whatsoever. They started me on smaller doses and increased them 3 times in a few minutes. Neither drug had any impact, fortunately, I was able to tolerate the camera and the procedure while awake and without any pain relief or sedation. So midazolam is now added to my list of drugs that does absolutely nothing. Nerve blocks work but require 3 or 4 times the normal dose plus top ups of local anesthetic, but at least I can tell them when I can still feel pain. I just wasn't able to talk with the camera in my lungs, or at least they told me not to. I'm starting to think it's me rather than the drugs.",Akala

I was given way too much of this and I am permanently disabled with chronic depression anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder.  Do your research on Versed and you’ll see what I mean and always tell and anesthesiologist that you don't want it so they don’t give it to you. They also try to lie and say it’s a pain reliever it’s not all versed it does is remove your memory and unfortunately sometimes that is permanent.,Serialmom
9,Midazolam,Light Anesthesia,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2020",2,"Versed (midazolam):I have taken this medication twice before going into an operation. The first time time the medication worked really well and right after taking it everything went blank and I just woke up right after. The second time however I believe my body somehow adapted to the drug and I was fully awake and aware of what was going on after taking the medication. Luckily they put me to sleep with another anesthesia once I got to the operating room, but I would not take this medicine for something like a dental procedure or something where you're going to be awake because there is a possibility that it won't make you blank out and you'll remember everything that happened unfortunately.",Verum

I never became sedated, was fully aware and I jumped sky high when the stuck me in my lumbar nerve/spine. So painful. I also ended up with a massive dural headache afterwards because I jumped! I'm never going back to that doctor again! This drug is not good a good choice for many people from what I've read. Additionally, your brain still recognizes the pain irregardless if you forget the procedure which I did not of course because I was wide awake and felt everything. I also have witnessed some of my elderly friends that were given this drug while in the throws of death while nursing homes, hospice situations, and in the hospitals. It was as if they had lost their minds to pain and laid screaming, & crying out; they couldn't even speak because they were given this horrible drug.",Never again

My mom went in for cataract surgery. She's an RN and super familiar with the process. They ended up giving her 6 mg of it and she was completely awake and unaffected. She was so unaffected by versed, that a couple hours after her surgery she went back to pick up her car and still needed Trazadone to fall asleep (she's prescribed this for insomnia). Thankfully she said there was zero pain, just felt like pressure. Does anyone else have similar experiences with Versed?",Confused

Conscious during the first stage (laser pulverization of my existing lens with a Femtosecond laser, took 2 minutes). Anxious and conscious, somewhat unable to move, but could cooperate and not panic. No memory of the second stage (implanting new lens.)The second night after surgery I woke up at 3 and could not sleep --had to get up and do stuff, unusual for me. I have been unusually anxious and suffering from 3 am insomnia for the past ten days.The prior cataract surgery was done with valium and a different opioid.  I was more relaxed and semi-conscious and did not have post-op insomnia or agitation. I will ask for an alternative to Versed in the future. Was it the drug or the setting?

I came back in mid conversation, realizing my body and brain had been operating without me. Felt like a robot that had been following commands with no free will;  Bizarre and unsettling experience. For hours after I got home I’d find myself somewhere in my house doing something and not know how I got there.  I tried to finish a book and ended up reading the same chapter over and over again. I had noticeable memory loss for two days and then didn’t feel totally back to normal for about a week. It felt like I was slowly recovering from temporary brain damage. I had to go back for a follow up to re-hear the results days later for what I’m told was actually the 3rd time I’d been given them. The staff and doctor were also acting awkward around me and I had a vague feeling of dread and embarrassment.  Not worth it.",Joe

My system usually needs extra meds for the right effect.I was given 1 1/2 doses of liquid versedand it wasn't sedating enough. Thankfully the eye drops worked better for the numbing.

25,Midazolam,Light Anesthesia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 23, 2018",1,Versed is a perfectly safe med. And it is amazing at relieving anxiety. It will not put you out on its own and even when used with fentanyl will cause conscious sedation. Propofol is the drug that puts you to sleep. These 3 drugs are not interchangeable ....they just work together. I had a colonoscopy done this am. Had some versed and then some fentanyl. All my anxiety vanished and felt no pain....although I was technically awake. Vaguely recall looking at monitor to see the insides of my colon. Totally relaxing. Great feeling...,Jess

Worked great and quick. I felt super floaty and like I was getting a buzz going. Only had 2mg as I was given Propofol for anesthesia, but I calmed right down and was pretty chill and the amnesia took a few minutes to kick in for me, as last thing I remember was my surgeon asking how I was feeling as she helped me on the OR table. I was  a little groggy afterwards but my procedure was only about 30 minutes so wore off me pretty quick, but I was definitely feeling a little less inhibited than usual, but in a funny way.

When I woke up in the recovery room and was having issues blurred vision, double vision, sensation of spinning, and loss of balance; my husband stated this had not happened before with Propofol.  I was told I was given Versed (a memory blocking drug). We were told the procedure went well, so I do not know why this side-effect inducing drug was administered. I was sent home while very unsteady on my feet with sensation of spinning, and loss of balance. I do not believe it was safe to discharge me in that condition. Indeed my husband called my son to help him get me into the house.

Not only did i loose the abity to lay down memory properly long term but the patches (it kinda feels like the connections are there of the bad experience you feel the trauma but you cant pin it on an exact block of memory) of the trauma remains i highly recomend the non-amnesic fentanyl instead for colonoscopies.",Miki_Ens
