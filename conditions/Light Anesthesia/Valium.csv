0,Valium,Light Anesthesia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 12, 2021",1,I was prescribed Valium for a dental procedure. 5mg and I have to say it worked wonders as I managed to have my wisdom tooth out without feeling so stressed.,Wright
1,Valium,Light Anesthesia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 18, 2020",10,More effective against my sciatica/herniated disc than Percocets.,Call4fire23
2,Valium,Light Anesthesia,,,"June 28, 2016",10,"My husband was given one valium (I don't know dosage ... family never knows much) prior to IVC removal.  As soon as procedure was complete he was very weak and short of breath and continues to be.  He feels terrible and cannot walk more than 5-6 feet.  He is epileptic and the doctor knows this.  From what I now understand valium shouldn't be given to seizure patients, and increased shortness of breath is a side effect.  I hope we never have to go through another experience like this.  At least, we know to refuse valium from now on.",Anonymous
3,Valium,Light Anesthesia,8.0,,"October 4, 2011",34,I was given one Valium tablet 20mins before my Lasik eye surgery and another one for later that day. It completely relaxed me for my procedure and on top of that acted as a very strong pain killer. Obviously it was used in conjunction with local anesthetic eye drops.,Anonymous
4,Valium,Light Anesthesia,5.0,,"September 26, 2010",24,"I was given Valium intravenously for light sedation during a quick medical procedure. It worked very well, but about 30 minutes after the i.v. was removed I became very irritable and depressed and craved more.  It also caused a slight temporary personality change in me that lasted the rest of the day.  ",leopardeyes
