0,Versed,Light Anesthesia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 1, 2021",0,I had Versed (midazolam) and propofol for a procedure and had a great experience. They were able to use half as much propofol as a result of the Versed being administered first. This meant that I came to and regained my coordination and senses in less than half the time.,Positive Exp
1,Versed,Light Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 22, 2020",10,It is my goal in life to get this awful drug off the market. I was given way too much of this and I am permanently disabled with chronic depression anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder.  Do your research on Versed and you’ll see what I mean and always tell and anesthesiologist that you don't want it so they don’t give it to you. They also try to lie and say it’s a pain reliever it’s not all versed it does is remove your memory and unfortunately sometimes that is permanent.,Serialmom
2,Versed,Light Anesthesia,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2020",2,"I have taken this medication twice before going into an operation. The first time time the medication worked really well and right after taking it everything went blank and I just woke up right after. The second time however I believe my body somehow adapted to the drug and I was fully awake and aware of what was going on after taking the medication. Luckily they put me to sleep with another anesthesia once I got to the operating room, but I would not take this medicine for something like a dental procedure or something where you're going to be awake because there is a possibility that it won't make you blank out and you'll remember everything that happened unfortunately.",Verum
3,Versed,Light Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 4, 2020",35,"Sharing for my mom because I'm curious if anyone is basically unaffected by Versed. My mom went in for cataract surgery. She's an RN and super familiar with the process. They ended up giving her 6 mg of it and she was completely awake and unaffected. She was so unaffected by versed, that a couple hours after her surgery she went back to pick up her car and still needed Trazadone to fall asleep (she's prescribed this for insomnia). Thankfully she said there was zero pain, just felt like pressure. Does anyone else have similar experiences with Versed?",Confused
4,Versed,Light Anesthesia,10.0,,"March 10, 2020",3,"I've had this drug several times for dental procedures and I just recently learned that people are actually AWAKE while on this!  I always thought it put me to sleep!  At least I feel that way!  I am so thankful for this drug!!!  Each and every time I am given Versed, I don't remember a thing about my procedure.  This last time, I don't even remember coming home.  It was awesome!!!!  This drug is truly a life saver for people terrified of procedures.",Driskey

6,Versed,Light Anesthesia,,,"December 27, 2019",3,"They gave me this before my gallbladder surgery, popped it in the IV, within a few minutes they were wheeling me in the OR and I remember NOTHING after that. Great drug!",Allyo
7,Versed,Light Anesthesia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 6, 2019",4,"My first experience with Versed wasn't a good one.  The doc didn't give me enough and it wore off before the procedure was done.  I just about came off the table when I realized what was going on.Last experience - a good one.  I whined to the periodontist that the Halcion I took wasn't enough.  He finally decided to add Versed, and I only remember about 5 seconds after he uttered the word ""Versed.""  The rest of my memory for the day is gone.  I'm told it shut me up too.  lol.",Patient Joe Smith
8,Versed,Light Anesthesia,3.0,,"June 5, 2019",8,"Was given this Versed prior to a minor 30 minute procedure. I came back in mid conversation, realizing my body and brain had been operating without me. Felt like a robot that had been following commands with no free will;  Bizarre and unsettling experience. For hours after I got home I’d find myself somewhere in my house doing something and not know how I got there.  I tried to finish a book and ended up reading the same chapter over and over again. I had noticeable memory loss for two days and then didn’t feel totally back to normal for about a week. It felt like I was slowly recovering from temporary brain damage. I had to go back for a follow up to re-hear the results days later for what I’m told was actually the 3rd time I’d been given them. The staff and doctor were also acting awkward around me and I had a vague feeling of dread and embarrassment.  Not worth it.",Joe
9,Versed,Light Anesthesia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 20, 2019",14,"I had Versed (midazolam) and Fentanyl used for as a  sedative for my bunionectomy. Drugs worked great for me.  However, about 10 days later I got out of bed with Vertigo.  I was just diagnosed with BPPV [Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]  I only have vertigo when my head changes position such as lying down or bending my head way back.  I am 52 year old female.  3 medical professionals say it is unrelated but I just read a website that states, BPPV is a side effect of benzodiazepines.",Sammy
10,Versed,Light Anesthesia,2.0,,"April 4, 2019",5,"I went in for cataract surgery today hoping I would be in a ""stupor twilight"",mode but I never got there. I struggled with the Dr as he told me to quit fighting him. I wriggled against the bright lights I had to follow. My system usually needs extra meds for the right effect.I was given 1 1/2 doses of liquid versedand it wasn't sedating enough. Thankfully the eye drops worked better for the numbing. If you can get a prescription of diazepam I would take one prior to surgery as they instructed me to do for my next surgery. It was only uncomfortable not painful. Procedure only took 5-10 min",Biscuits
11,Versed,Light Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 8, 2018",6,"I had this, Versed 2 mg in IV, with my cataract surgery. After my right eye I began to lose my hair on the right side in extremes. After my left side was done the same happened on my left side. I then began to notice big blotches in the back of my head. With my hair matting when combed. This has been very traumatic to me. I'm warning everyone I know.",RGJ

13,Versed,Light Anesthesia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 3, 2018",2,"Had this earlier in the week for minor surgery and was given this to help my anxiety before going into the OR. Worked great and quick. I felt super floaty and like I was getting a buzz going. Only had 2mg as I was given Propofol for anesthesia, but I calmed right down and was pretty chill and the amnesia took a few minutes to kick in for me, as last thing I remember was my surgeon asking how I was feeling as she helped me on the OR table. I was  a little groggy afterwards but my procedure was only about 30 minutes so wore off me pretty quick, but I was definitely feeling a little less inhibited than usual, but in a funny way. It did make me super chatty once it was starting to wear off, though. But all-in-all a good experience for me.",N/A
14,Versed,Light Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 20, 2018",19,"Told the anesthesiologist not to give me Versed because it made me nauseous. I had been meditating and was very relaxed on the operating table awaiting my hip replacement. Suddenly I became afraid, paranoid and the last I remembered was trying to get off the table. I had prolonged amnesia, nausea, hiccups for 24 hours, and I cried and was anxious for a week afterwards. My records show I was given Versed despite telling them not to.",Bionic
15,Versed,Light Anesthesia,1.0,,"December 1, 2017",42,"I had Versed for a Colonoscopy ~14 years ago.  I was not told in advance I would be ""put out"" and my memory be erased.  After been hooked up to the IV, for pain management, the nurse said ""you don't want to remember this anyway.""  I went out as the procedure started and woke up in recovery.  I went home and shook for 4 hours.  For the next 10 years or so my short-term memory was impaired. I attended a service school thereafter and had a lot of trouble remembering items for tests.  I normally do very well . I have reoccurring nightmares of the procedure (PTSD?).  This is terrible drug, it is immoral to erase one's memory without their full understanding in advance. I bear a lot of animosity towards the clinic.  I will never allow its use again",Brown Bear
16,Versed,Light Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 27, 2017",34,"I blindly accepted this poison for my first cardiac catheterization and first colonoscopy. It did NOTHING during the procedures. I remember everything and felt everything. What it did do was make permanent changes in my ability to remember things - especially names. Since then, I'm also frequently searching for common words. I list Versed as an allergy now so it'll never be used on me again.",JDS25
17,Versed,Light Anesthesia,1.0,,"March 23, 2017",34,"Had Versed for cataract surgery.  OK post surgery but woke up from nap afterward with uncontrollable emotions, terrifying. It's 3 1/2 months later and I'm still having occasional flooding of anxiety and depression. Also had memory problems for 2 months.  horrific experience, I will never be given this drug again.",Sherimno
18,Versed,Light Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2016",44,"I would like to lodge a complaint. I came in for surgery on 12-17-16. I told the anesthesiologist that I did not want memory blocking drugs. He told me I would be given Propofol which was fine with me I had that before with good results. When I woke up in the recovery room and was having issues blurred vision, double vision, sensation of spinning, and loss of balance; my husband stated this had not happened before with Propofol.  I was told I was given Versed (a memory blocking drug). We were told the procedure went well, so I do not know why this side-effect inducing drug was administered. I was sent home while very unsteady on my feet with sensation of spinning, and loss of balance. I do not believe it was safe to discharge me in that condition. Indeed my husband called my son to help him get me into the house. Most of all I feel my trust was violated, and my wishes were not followed while I was in a vunerable position, and this greatly concerns me. Next time do I need to request that my husband stay with me through the complete procedure for my own protection from the staff?",No Versed For ME!
19,Versed,Light Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 10, 2016",27,"I recieved medazilam, commonly called versed for my first colonoscopies, note versed is a amnesia drug they use so you ""forget"" how bad they treat you, and that you were in pain rather than relieve the trauma. I suffered anxiety,  long term amnesia, flashbacks and a PTSD-type reaction to the use of this drug. Not only did i loose the abity to lay down memory properly long term but the patches (it kinda feels like the connections are there of the bad experience you feel the trauma but you cant pin it on an exact block of memory) of the trauma remains i highly recomend the non-amnesic fentanyl instead for colonoscopies.",Miki_Ens
20,Versed,Light Anesthesia,1.0,,"February 3, 2016",30,I was given Versed pre-surgery for a D & C and within minutes I was vomiting violently. The surgery had to be cancelled due to my extreme reaction. I was dry heaving for 4 hours and was sick for days. I had terrible vertigo and very loud ringing in my ears. That was 5 months ago and I'm still being treated for vertigo and tinnitus. I was told by my ENT that the drug probably caused a disconnect between my ears and my brain. I am going to therapy and it is helping some. I could not drive for 3 months and am driving again. I'm always slightly dizzy and the loud high pitched sound in my head may be permanent. I was never told about the negative effects before taking this drug.,walluval
21,Versed,Light Anesthesia,1.0,,"January 22, 2016",19,"This drug was given to me as I'm allergic to eggs and the other anesthesia was egg-based. I asked what was in this drug and was told, ""I don't know."" Waking up to bits and pieces of reality, trying to grab on to them, but not being successful repeatedly. Going home was double vision when I got there  I immediately threw up. I didn't want to move. My husband got a chair on wheels to wheel me directly to the bathroom and brought me bedding and a pillow and lay on the bathroom floor. I slept all day and all night. That is one drug I will NEVER take again.",Anonymous
22,Versed,Light Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 19, 2015",15,I was given this medication IV before a radiofrequency nerve ablation.  I had absolutely no response and had to tolerate the procedure with no assistance.  It was extremely painful and nerve-wracking.  They gave me the medication and started the procedure without ever checking to see if I was comfortable.,suesiegel
23,Versed,Light Anesthesia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 13, 2015",15,I had dental implants. I was a nervous wreck going to the dentists office. I was in the dentists chair for 5 minutes and after that I don't remember a thing. The next thing I remember was my daughter getting my prescriptions filled at the pharmacy. I am thrilled to say this anesthetic was great ! I wish everyone of my surgical procedures was this easy. No after effects.,Tootsie111

I had four molars extracted, a sinus lift and bone grafting. I asked to be put out. I was crying from fear before the surgery, worried about getting sick from the anesthesia. They gave me some versed in my iv and everything was okay. I loved it, maybe too much. No anesthesia sickness and NO fear. I highly recommend it.",Anxmommy

He wouldn't listen.  Put me immediately out and my oxygen blood level went down to 51. Had I stayed at that level for 5 minutes I would have died.  The hospital changed the grrecords. I was conguiding. gasping for air. eye Dr said I Jerked side to side violently.  Lucky it was at a time in procedure that it didn't matter.
