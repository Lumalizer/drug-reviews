0,Lorazepam,Light Anesthesia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 29, 2020",10,Ativan is a wonderful drug for dental work. I was prescribed one valium before I got there and ativans were given throughout 4 extractions. I never felt a thing and even thought that he only pulled 1 cos I asked and he said nope we are done. Even got rest of my teeth cleaned. Not sure if was before or after extractions. Had to have someone drive and when went to drugstore to get pain pills I was thirsty and told my friend I was gonna get a bottle water and came out with a whole case. Have no clue why but must thought I may be thirsty later. Highly recommend for sedation and dentistry over any other.,Vod Kanockers
1,Lorazepam,Light Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 20, 2020",13,"Ativan (lorazepam):I was prescribed 2mg Ativan to take 2 hours before a dentist appointment (Iâ€™m a 110 lb woman). I took it 2 hours prior and within a half hour, the whole room was spinning and I was getting nauseous. I was only not dizzy if I was laying down. It seemed like an impossible task to walk to the car and be driven to the dentist and endure an appointment in that state. I stayed home and immediately fell asleep for 5 hours. I felt nauseous upon waking and it got better after eating a small amount of bland food. It is not evening and I feel better, just very groggy and a little slow feeling. I would rather endure the dentist appointment than go through this again.",dizzy
2,Lorazepam,Light Anesthesia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 30, 2019",11,"It didn't work at all for me, was given 3mg to take prior to dental appointment, that appointment has been postponed now. I was unable to stop moving, dizzy, talking extremely fast, felt like I needed to run and run for miles. Was not calm at all. What happened to me is apparently uncommon, but I won't be taking this for dentist appointments again.",Anonymous
3,Lorazepam,Light Anesthesia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 16, 2016",45,"I have extreme dental anxiety.  The dentist prescribed 3 mg an hour prior to dental work along with a valium the evening before and the procedure went wonderful.  I did not feel any pain although I was a bit loopy the rest of the day  :)  I went home after the procedure and went to bed.  No lingering effects. I had 2 teeth pulled, deep cleaning, prep work for a bridge and a temporary bridge installed.",Auzzie2016

5,Lorazepam,Light Anesthesia,10.0,,"April 14, 2011",21,"Ativan (lorazepam):Today I had some very severe back pain and after trying some other medications that did not work well at all, they gave me i.v. Ativan and the spasms stopped almost immediately.",Anonymous
6,Lorazepam,Light Anesthesia,10.0,,"January 15, 2011",23,Ativan (lorazepam):I was given Ativan during a small procedure and it worked okay. I didn't feel anything ...just a had a bit of a hangover after the procedure.,Anonymous
7,Lorazepam,Light Anesthesia,10.0,,"January 1, 2010",26,"My dentist doesn't use sedation so he prescribed 2mg lorazepam the night before, 1 in the morning and 1 an hour before my tooth extractions!! It worked wonders. I'm terrified of dentists by the way. I also was prescribed this same dosing for a closed machine MRI, it was very effective. I also use 1 mg for anxiety (panic attacks). It is a bit less effective - I'd give it a 7 out of 10 for that use.",sabsteak
8,Lorazepam,Light Anesthesia,9.0,,"April 1, 2008",18,I'm taking Lorazepam 2mg every 6 hrs as needed for pain.  This has worked wonderfully for me with no side effects.  I'm on this medication ONLY until my surgery pain goes away.,Anniebugs
