0,Bactrim,Meningitis,1,,"February 19, 2020",16,"The ER Dr. prescribed him Bactrim to help with the forever ear infection. My son was taking the antibiotics for 2 weeks when he began experiencing symptoms like meningitis. He complained of his head hurting, stiff neck, back pain, sore throat, fever, and stomach ache. Took him to the ER they did blood work and different test and found nothing wrong. Dr. sent me home told me to continue the antibiotics. I gave it to him again, and again the same reaction. I stopped giving it him and he broke out with this massive rash that burned and itched. He itched for a week. I did research on this drug and found out this drug can cause aseptic meningitis, I was poisoning my kid! On further research I found this drug can alter blood test so that they would not know to look for meningitis. The scariest part is the medical professionals missed this and told me to keep giving this poison to my child. I HATE THIS DRUG! IT IS THE WORSE DRUG TO GIVE ANYONE! I paid 151 dollars to poison my child.",BW
