0,Magnesium oxide,Hypomagnesemia,3,,"September 23, 2016",29,"I took magnesium glycinate for months with no problem, when I ran out of it I bought this one (magnesium oxide) because it was alot cheaper. Pretty soon I started having a weird cramp in my calves when I walked.  I stopped taking it for two weeks, no cramps. Started it again and had cramps immediately (only when walking). So I went ahead and bought the more expensive glycinate, and sure enough I haven't had any cramps.  Weird!  But I won't take this one ever again.",Stephiep76
1,Magnesium oxide,Hypomagnesemia,3,,"October 30, 2011",44,"I started this medicine at the suggestion of my D.O. as my magnesium levels were very low and I had bad leg cramps.  It did help the cramps quite a bit and my blood levels did return to normal.However, I began to have bad bouts of nausea and vomiting and occasional diarrhea that I had to take additional medication to stop.  I took 400 mg but was never advised to take it with food. ",nanasgirl
