0,Itraconazole,Dermatophytosis,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 30, 2022",0,"Started a course of 50 mg twice a day itraconazole, developed a mild to moderate headache every time I had a a dose. Drinking a lot of water and having some food helped in reducing the headaches.  However a mild headache persisted throughout the day. I stopped taking the medicine after 5 days due to the headache and now I am relying on a topical anti-fungal agent for a Yeast infection.Did not have any other side effects however headache persisted throughout the day.",Aryan Kishore
1,Itraconazole,Dermatophytosis,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 23, 2021",1,"What started out as a misdiagnosed flea bite turned into the spreading of lesions all the way from my ankles to my shoulders (and everywhere in between).  So far this medication has appeared to stop (day 12, 100mg a day for 15 days) the spread, reverse the skin color to its original color, and bring the inflammation down.  HOWEVER, beware the emotional effects.  My (otherwise) physically healthy body, exercise loving, outdoors type of motivated personality has crumbled into a short, anxiety ridden temper, who is constantly irritable and fearful.  It has also modified my appetite in a negative way.  Good luck.",UnfortunateExpat
2,Itraconazole,Dermatophytosis,8,,"November 6, 2020",3,"On my 5th day of itraconazole for a severe fungal scalp infection that I have suffered with for the last 12 months. It’s starting to look like it’s finally clearing up, the side effects haven’t been to bad mostly just an upset stomach & loss of hunger. But I think that could be more based on my anxiety disorder then itraconazole. Hopefully the side effects eventually get easier.",Anonymous
