0,Terbinafine,Cutaneous Candidiasis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 20, 2021",0,"Lamisil (terbinafine):BEWARE! I started taking terbinafine in December 2020 for a 12 week prescription I developed acute pins and needles in my feet and ankles I went to Emory Univesity hospital neurology, rheumatology infectious disease to determine what was going on they could not find the cause. I flew to the mayo clinic in Rochester Minnesota they did multiple test including a sural Nerve Biopsy to confirm that I had Vasculitic Neuropathy that is damaging my peripheral nervous system. The disease spread over eight months at my legs over my knees with pins and needles into my hands wrists and lower back. Iâ€™m now on chemotherapy and prednisone to try to get the inflammation and reset my immune system with a prayer that it will go into remission.  This seems to be something related with the gap junction and the way the medicine blocks chemicals in the axons from working properly that is my best guess. Please beware of taking this drug is in 12 months   This is the only drug I was taking for a rash.",Vasculitic Neur

2,Terbinafine,Cutaneous Candidiasis,2,,"December 15, 2019",8,"I was put on this  medication for 2 weeks for a skin rash, I took it for a total of 7 days, on the 6th day I suddenly became very nauseous and had to leave work. On the 7th day I got the same nausea along with shortness of breath, my heart felt like it was going crazy like I had just been on a run when I was only resting. This kept me up in the middle of the night as my chest was so uncomfortable. Also had headaches and stomach pain, lost my appetite and felt generally ill. I've been off it for 4 days and still not feeling 100%, looking forward to feeling myself again. It did start helping the rash but did a lot more harm than good",Unknown
3,Terbinafine,Cutaneous Candidiasis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2019",12,"I want to share my negative experience with a drug with you. It concerns a medicament called Terbinafin Mylan 250mg. I only have a fungal infection and by using the drug for 5 days now I am experiencing depressions, anxiety, panic attacks, paranoia. Less serious are diarrhea, partial loss of appetite, fatigue and lassitude. I never knew using drugs can have such negative consequences, as this is my first negative experience with side effects, so I only wanted you to be aware.",Xyz
4,Terbinafine,Cutaneous Candidiasis,2,,"June 30, 2017",7,"I had been taking 1 terbinafine tablet daily for intestinal candidiasis for almost 2 months when I got itchy red bumps on my legs, which soon spread to red bumps and blotches on my arms and upper chest along with incredible itching . After eliminating scabies as cause, terbinafine was identified as the culprit, since my only other prescription medication was Synthroid, which I have taken for more than 60 years without problems. I've been off terbinafine for 2 months. The bumps have all gone down, blotches are fading, and I no longer have the unbelievable itching, which I couldn't stop even with 30 mg. of dye-free Benadryl capsules.  I will never take this drug again, even though it did help with the candida (assessed by delayed reaction to allergy testing).",MAROSE11
5,Terbinafine,Cutaneous Candidiasis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 18, 2015",9,"Have had a fungal infection in my mouth for almost a year and have tried many mess, however, this medication has been a nightmare!!!  Will take last of a 10 day treatment @ 250 mgs. Have had severe nausea, severe heartburn ( living on tums for that), no taste, and a massive migraine for the whole 10 days. My question is "" how long does this stay in your system because I can't take much more of this.""  Informed Doctor of problems and was told of 2 options... Stop the drug or suffer through it. Can't stop the medication because I can no longer eat due to mouth sores.",Darlylj
