2,Nystatin topical,Cutaneous Candidiasis,8.0,,"April 12, 2020",17,"I am very prone to cutaneous candidiasis in the folds of my skin due to sweating.  I recently had surgery that wreaked havoc on my immune system and led to a cutaneous yeast infection very near to my surgery incisions.  It became so bad that I had to go back to my surgeon's office and the nurse practitioner prescribed oral steroids (methylprednisolone, 5 day pack) and nystatin powder that is used on infants for diaper rash (Nystop).  She also recommended washing the area daily with Cetaphil, drying it thoroughly with a hair dryer, and putting Telfa non-adhesive bandages on the area to absorb additional moisture.  I've been doing what she recommended and the area has healed so well.  I did have to ask for a refill because the 60g bottle wasn't enough to get rid of the rash (it was on a large area).  I'm treating the rash for as long as the area is red, as directed.",MissLeopard83

9,Nystatin topical,Cutaneous Candidiasis,5.0,,"November 20, 2015",12,"I applied the cream to the affected area twice daily. The initially, it decreased the itching and rash in the area. However after several weeks of use, itching begin to increase after using the cream. So I read the label ingredients and saw that it had aluminum in it. I have no doubt that is aluminum that is causing the new itching because I can't use aluminum chlorohydrate in deodorant as it causes intense itching and affects the pores in my underarms. So I will need to find something else to treat the affected area.",Birdy062

11,Nystatin topical,Cutaneous Candidiasis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2012",31,"I have had this prescribed for both of my.kids when they were in diapers. They would get a yeast infection on the surface of their skin, and this medicine eradicated it almost immediately. Their itching stopped with the first application, and after a few days the infection was gone. I have recently used it for a yeast infection on the surface of the skin as well. The itching stopped immediately and after four applications the infection is almost gone. Would definitely recommend it.",cowgirlsmb
