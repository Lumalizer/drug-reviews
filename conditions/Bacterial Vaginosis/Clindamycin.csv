Three days after I finished the boric it's back with a vengeance. Reading these comments I am gonna deff try the clindamycin inserts if they have it where I am . If not I'll try tinidazole and if that doesn't work  I don't know what I will do",Chall93

4,Clindamycin,Bacterial Vaginosis,7.0,,"May 20, 2020",3,"I'm 25, prescribed clindamycin cream 5g/night over 5 days for BV. 1st night I experienced crippling stomach pain within 2 hrs. 2nd night a tremor/shaking, with creamy white discharge the next day as well as frothy, cloudy urine. 3rd night was fine, but had very pale stool. 4th night I became very hot 2 hour after dosage and woke up halfway through the night in a puddle of sweat, I assume I broke a fever. 5th (last) night was fine but am experiencing extremely watery diarrhea 24 hours after last dose. Perhaps my prescribed dose was a little too strong, as my side effects were pretty intense. Taking the cream insertion was easy and straightforward, no mess, no burning. I recommend this antibiotic over metronidazole (flagyl). Along with MANY horrific side effects including a paralyzing audio hallucination lasting >10mins, I still have a (mild) ringing in my ear that was brought on after taking a single 2g dose of metronidazole to treat trichomoniasis 2 yrs ago.",BVpatient
5,Clindamycin,Bacterial Vaginosis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 26, 2019",6,"First let me just say that after reading many of the reviews, I was terrified to take this drug. Reading all of the scary side effects, and the fact that I have difficulty swallowing the capsules. I went and purchased Florajen Digestion Probiotics. I know I needed to avoid the horrible diarrhea I read about and I believe the probiotic helped me prevent that. (I took the probiotic twice a day)I drank a large glass of water prior to taking the medicine (2 cups total). I then cooked a small amount of oatmeal and placed approximately 3 tablespoons into a small bowl. I cut open the capsule and emptied the medicine into the oatmeal and stirred it together.  Be aware that this powder is one of the most horrible tastes I have ever had in my mouth. I scooped up some of the oatmeal on a spoon and put it in my mouth. I drank more water with the oatmeal to help it slide down my throat. To help with the nasty taste in my mouth, I then sucked on a lemon drop piece of candy.",Bioteach
6,Clindamycin,Bacterial Vaginosis,5.0,,"July 25, 2019",120,The only time I have gotten BV was from my partner. Doctors will tell you that is not your partners fault but that your vagina doesn’t agree with your partners sperm.  My boyfriend and I have been tested for everything you can imagine and we are both clean. I took it upon myself to treat him with flagyl 3 times a day for 7 days. Guess what it worked! It took me 2 years of going through recurrent infections before I tried this.  This medication always helped me but every time we decided to have unprotected sex the BV would return until he was treated.  I’m not sure if some of you women have had the same issue as me but take what I did into consideration.  You won’t know unless you try!,Anonymous

I never in my life thought I would be writing reviews for medicine but here I am. Metronidazole ruined my life for a week. The oral tab was a nightmare and the gel made my bits swell up and burn so bad I couldn’t walk. I called back and requested this because I saw all the good reviews. I’m on day one and it’s already like a million times better. I gave it a 9 because I’ve now taken two doses and don’t feel 100%. But I’m hoping at the end of the 7 days it’ll be better. The only side effect of this so far is that I’m sleepy and my stomach was a little upset. Other than that, it’s a life saver!!",Marro63
9,Clindamycin,Bacterial Vaginosis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 29, 2019",26,"Clindamycin is the best antibiotic I've tried for BV WHEN taken in conjunction with probiotics. Curing BV requires obtaining the correct balance of good and bad bacteria down there. Antibiotics kill both, so it is essential to replace that good bacteria. Research the correct way to take probiotics and get a good quality brand. I spent almost 5 years trying to cure BV. It would go away, and then come right back. Probiotics have been the answer for me. I take them every day, and I double up when taking antibiotics for anything.",Anonymous
10,Clindamycin,Bacterial Vaginosis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 8, 2019",9,"Was prescribed Metronidazole pills and the first day was fine- symptoms went away almost instantly, mild side effect of a bit of nausea and drowsiness. Nothing I couldn’t handle. Second day was a literal nightmare: dizziness, confusion, fever, vomiting, cold sweats. I went back to my doctor and she said we’d try the Clindamycin vaginal cream. FAIR WARNING it’s a lot more expensive than the pills. But the cramps and discharge were so bad, and there was NO WAY I was going to go through 5 more days of vomiting and utter hell. Now on the first night of the cream and so far so good. Symptoms mostly abated, no side effects at all. I’m feeling more confident this won’t have me spending the night with my head in the toilet again... so far would recommend over the metronidazole,",KatwithaK

It gave me a yeast infection . I’m supposed to take it for 3 days but it’s my second day and I’m dying of how bad my yeast infection is.

I have had loose stool but it’s not too bad like I can deal with and I’m not in pain. I just go to the bathroom easier and I sometimes I get heartburn but it doesn’t last long.  Overall this is the best medication I have taken for bacterial vaginosis.  I really haven’t had too many problems, I’ve been a little tired but I’m always tired  - I’m a mom LOL. I don’t see why there are so many people making bad reviews on this medicine because it’s so much better than Flagyl",Katie
16,Clindamycin,Bacterial Vaginosis,8.0,,"April 24, 2018",8,I felt like I needed to write a review bc all the other reviews scared me. I do not tolerate flagyl so when I came down with BV again I opted for the cream. While it is messy and unpleasant it is much better than the pill for me. I will say that I have experienced some body aches but it seems to go away throughout the day and especially after I workout. Overall not so bad. I’m on day 2 of 7.,Jul

I have previously received one-day pills and vaginal suppositories on different occasions, but none have been effective on the long-run. The same gyn recently prescribed clindamycin 300mg twice a day for 7 days, however, gave me the complete Rx for 10 days in case I need it.

20,Clindamycin,Bacterial Vaginosis,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 30, 2017",3,I was prescribed 300mg twice a day for seven days and the next day it was still there so went back to the hospital and I was prescribed another three days of the same dosage. It cleared my infection and it was not awful taking it (I do not swallow pills so I chew them) - I put the powder in bread then used icing to swallow everything - the taste did remain a long time but its all because of the previous antibiotics that screwed up my tongue). The reason why I am not giving it a perfect score is because it gave me a yeast infection so more medication for me to take (another 1 for the new infection).,shumibiggi

It cleared up my infection within a few days, so it has definitely been effective, although I can't say that I've enjoyed taking it. The blue capsules I was given taste like a cross between bug spray and nail polish remover, and they made me gag every time. Once I actually threw the pill up, so I would suggest taking with food if you have a weak stomach. Toward the end of my prescription I noticed a slight orange/pink discharge which may or may not be a side effect of the medication. Both the discharge and the nausea may have been exacerbated by the fact that I'm currently pregnant.",khaleesi420
