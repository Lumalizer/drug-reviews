0,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,1.0,,"March 26, 2022",0,"I used the vaginal metro gel a few times in the last year for recurrent bv and each time it literally made me feel suicidal. Like clockwork, about 48 hours after the final dose the deep depression starts to lift and I’m back to myself again but not quite. I’ve found it can take up to 2 weeks to feel functional after finishing a course of metronidazole. I always have to mentally prepare myself before I take the first dose because I know what’s coming. Each time I remind myself that it’s going to cause a deep depression but mentally preparing doesn’t help tbh. It also makes me physically ill like the flu, you can’t be functional. I’ve had to go into work on this crap and just about lost it. Was so hard not to cry because body felt so weak and sickly and mind was dark. Do not recommend to anyone whose sensitive to medications. Although I have a feeling a lot of people are experiencing these horrific side effects that normally are good responders.",Anonymous

It made me incredibly drowsy like I took a heavy duty sedative. I have not been able to stay awake for 3 days!! I missed a very important meeting for my son with the school because I couldn’t wake up. I am SO embarrassed! I feel stuck in the twilight zone. It also caused me severe nausea, vomiting, sweating, and weakness in my arms and legs. I felt as if I could collapse if I stood up. It caused strange dreams and hallucinations also.",Anonymous

The odor and discomfort goes away around the 2nd day. I was so embarrassed because two days before taking this medication I was working and the smell would seep through my pants and make me so uncomfortable, now that I’ve been taking the meds I work comfortably no odor no itch thankfully . Ladies just continue to take medication as prescribed, no sex and I’ll suggest taking with cranberry juice because it’s so bitter and chase with water. Please do not drink soda pop or alcohol while consuming this medication because it will lower the chances of the medication working properly.",Anonymous

Do not base your choices on other people experiences, I almost backed out of taking this medication after I was prescribed from my doctor because of all the negative reviews I saw. Personally it did me no harm and resolved my issue, the only slight problem I had was bloating after each dose which was easily solved with bloating meds. I would definitely recommend trying the course first before backing out because some people had bad experiences. We’re all different",Anonymous
5,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,5.0,,"December 6, 2021",0,"I have had BV in the past and metronidazole has always been what’s prescribed. Back in the day I would have no side effects, but I recently got BV and started on metronidazole 500mg 2x a day. The smell went away around day 2 and I didn’t have any symptoms until day 4 or 5. I had slight abdominal pain and dark urine. Towards the end of the 7 day period I started feeling extremely fatigued but had difficulty falling asleep, I felt anxious, emotional and irritable. All of these symptoms are VERY uncommon for me, and metronidazole is the only difference in my routine so I know it’s the medicine. The side effects are not bad in comparison to the BV side effects I was experiencing.",Ya girl sav
6,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 8, 2021",0,"I was prescribed Flagyl for a bacterial infection. I was suppose to take it twice a day for one week. After day one of taking the first dose, I had to stop the medication. I had INTENSE flu like symptoms. Nausea, body aches, everything. After reading reviews on here I knew I wasn’t going crazy. A week later I went on vacation and my body was still so messed up. Burning stomach. Couldn’t eat. Nauseous. It would come and go. It’s been about 3 and a half weeks later and I’m still having awful episodes. I’m worried that this medication destroyed my stomach. It’s been a week now since feeling awful again and I can’t eat, nauseous, stomach hurts while eating. Lightheaded. Anxiety at an all time high. I was perfectly fine till I took this medication. Please stay away from it, it’s poison and there’s other options to help clear your infection.",Awful
7,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 4, 2021",1,"I had recurrent BV for 6 times from February to August. yea.. SIX. I tried both pill and gel. My symptoms were pelvic cramps, similar to period cramps but a sharper pain. They would hurt so bad that they would wake me up in the middle of the night. The pain usually lasted for about 5 minutes. It wouldn't go away until I got antibiotics. my vagina smelled different, not stinky or fishy... just different from my normal vaginal smell. I tested negative for all STDs. BTW I got it every time I had sex with my boyfriend at first but we were apart for 3 months and I still got it even tho we didn't have sex. My theory is that taking flagyl that many times messed up my gut bacteria since it gets rid of all bacteria - everything. I also had a bad diet, so the bad bacteria would take over every time. I've been BV free for 3 months now all thanks to renew life ultimate flora probiotics and eating healthy (I drink smoothies w/ fruits/veggies). I also use boric acid once a week, but mostly the probiotics and a good diet.I  hope this helps",tris
8,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 29, 2021",1,"Unfortunately, still dealing with the horrible side effects 5 months after stopping a 5 day course of this (1000mg/day). I have severe nerve damage, can't walk or sit up since my body feels so heavy, loss of appetite, pain in hands and feet. A few days after discontinuation is when the severe dizziness started and still remains. First month, I had severe muscle spasms all over my body which lead to muscle wasting and loss of 15 lbs. My spine and neck sway back and forth when I stand up. I strongly regret taking this medication since my life has been ruined by it.",Jannie

It was effective and made all of the horrible BV symptoms go away but I had bad side effects from this medication . I had anxiety, heart palpitations, headaches, awful nightmares, and mild constipation . I finished the medication yesterday and am currently waiting for it to completely clear out of my body. I’m really hoping that the side effects will go away soon. I just want to feel like myself again.

10,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 26, 2021",2,"I'm on day 5/7. Only symptoms: soft stools & warm tingly feeling in tummy. BV symptoms gone after 2 days. These reviews scared me.  My doctor told me I needed to take it with food, stay really well hydrated, not to drink alcohol, & most importantly supplementing with probiotics and/or eat yogurt in between their antibiotics. This will help protect your gut health. Antibiotics take a huge toll on gut health, you NEED good bacteria. Eat yogurt in between pills. Take pills at same time frames (Ex. 10AM & 10PM). Not one day at 9AM and then at midnight. I'm sorry for those that had a bad experience, but I had a lot of anxiety reading peoples reviews that made me worry. It can make a difference for some people if you eat healthy, avoid alcohol, caffeine, & spicy foods, EAT YOUR PROBIOTICS, & drink lots of water. A lot of digestive discomfort can be avoided if you do this. Feast before each pill if needed. Eating big meals helps a lot.",Glitter Queen

I literally have choked on it and had to spit it up because it was so nasty. I wish they had something else to prescribe for this. Also avoid alcohol at ALL COSTS! Drank half a glass of wine on it once and immediately was flushed and felt dizzy. It does the job though, but I wish there was an alternative.",ash

My BV has gone to my delight but by goodness the side effects have really not been great (to put it lightly)! I rang my doctors this morning because of the effects this antibiotic is having on me, I take it with food 1 in the morning and 1 on the evening. Side effects for me have been, extreme anxiety, feeling dissociated (kind of out of body) jittery, depressed and generally out of it. My head has also felt very bizzare! Roll on the end of this medication! Not wanting to scare any one here but if it wasn’t for reading these reviews and putting my mind at ease knowing I am not alone and already trying home treatments I would not take this medication.

And reading that others got so messed up makes me feel like I’m not alone. Had to take twice a day for 2 weeks. The taste is so bad it makes you lose your appetite, just it touching your tongue. Nausea, Diarrhea AND constipation, insomnia, bladder pain, messed up my kidneys, shortness of breath, dizziness ridiculous anxiety and sadness . Oral thrush, rash on my face/lips developed a week into taking it and lasted 2 weeks. Bad lower stomach pain/cramping. The worst part is I made it to the second to last day and my body couldn’t handle it. I passed out, threw up crapped myself (luckily I was home) busted up my face had to go to the ER for stitches. Then had to finish taking it the last day after. I’m at 3 weeks after finishing my course and I still feel like crap (BV cured tho). Still constipated, Trouble with the oral thrush still.

19,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,1.0,,"July 14, 2021",0,"Had to take 2 tablets everyday for a whole week. The first pill didn’t have any effect on me, but 2nd pill gave me such a bad stomachache but it didn't go away even after eating. On my third pill, I started feeling really nauseous and it would last for HOURS. The stomach aches happen at random times  too and would last for almost 1hour. Super uncomfortable and kept me up all night even though I was so drowsy. On my 4th day, I really wanted to eat a full meal because I felt weak from eating too little because the medicine makes my stomach upset. I ended up vomiting that day as the nausea was too strong. I'm going to take my last pill later today, and I’m feeling as nauseous as on the 4th day of my medication. I cannot wait for this to be over :( I'm no stranger to antibiotics but none of them gave me symptoms as bad as this! I'm never taking this pill again unless I'm left with no choice.

20,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 14, 2021",2,Just wanted to share my experience as reading some of the reviews below had me thinking twice about taking this medication. I am on day 3/7 and have had zero nasty side effects. My advise would be to take after a decent size meal with a glass of water and you won't have any issues. I do think this medication is quite strong as its working already so if you don't eat a substantial meal before taking you may have some side effects.,MHJ
21,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,9.0,,"July 11, 2021",0,"Today is July 11th , 2021 & it is currently 9:21am , I started taking the Metronidazole 500mg (twice daily) for BV July 9th. Like most people on here I was nervous and scared after reading the reviews to start taking them cause I didn’t want any of the possible common side effects or the rare ones but I HAD to take it eventually. To anyone who is prescribed this please don’t overthink it, I typically take it @11am then again @11pm. Today will make day 3/7 & I haven’t had ANY side effects ! I couldn’t really say if the symptoms are gone due to me being on my cycle BUT seeing as many people in the reviews have said they’ve seen theirs go away within 2 days I’ll go off that. The taste is definitely nasty but it’s gone within a few seconds. Just stay hydrated & DON’T overthink it :)",DT

I was so nauseous throughout the course of my 7 day treatment and could not stop vomiting during day 3 of treatment. The headaches, bloating, and dizziness peaked from days 3-5. I dreaded having to take the pills knowing I was in for a living hell between 1-3 hours after taking them. The months of trying to get my antipsychotic medication doses right was less of a pain than the 7 days on Metro. It's a necessary med, but I feels like a wrath from God.",Send Help
23,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 5, 2021",8,"Took metronidazole for BV and like many of you, I was horrified when I came across these reviews before taking them. I was super hesitant but I ended up taking them anyway. To my surprise, I did not experience any side effects, literally zero!!!! I am SUPER super relived and happy. I am also only 4/7 days in and no more smell/discharge! Tip: For people who cannot stand the metallic taste of the pill, put the pill as far back in your mouth as possible—and I mean really far back—and gulp down water as soon as you do. Never had an issue with the taste by doing so!",T
24,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 4, 2021",1,"This worked very good. Within 3 days my infection seems to have cleared up.  I was prescribed it because of testing positive, but only had minor symptoms  which didn’t bother me much.  However, I do believe it worked for bacteria my digestive system TOO— which had been bothering me before taking it!  My whole  body felt better, and mind clearer.  It tastes nasty.   I drank lots of water the days I took it,  it really does help to flush the dying bacteria out... ironically though I was far less thirsty (so  attentiveness is important)!  I did stop taking it as soon as it created adverse effects (bloating) because of get rid of   good bacteria too. Then took probiotics and ate fermented food to restore balance in my gut.",Aqua
25,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 3, 2021",0,"I will never take these meds again! I was Prescribed 500mg metronidazole every 12 hours for 7 days, 4 days ago for BV, and when I say I’m miserable I mean it, I was feeling fine for the first 2 days although I noticed I was pooping a lot more throughout the day but I thought it was just my stomach issues but by the 3rd day I can say I’ve experienced almost, if not all of the side effects, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, loss of appetite, numbness on my hands and feet, shaking as if my blood sugars low, cramps, and gas. Doing anything is a chore from getting out of bed to eating, my back hurts, I get a burning feeling in my stomach, the best way I can describe it is if you were drinking whiskey and your belly gets hot, I have pains in my chest and sides, and my head hurts. Please, ask your doctor about another treatment, bc this is absolutely terrible, If I knew about the symptoms and how others were affected, I’d never would’ve accepted this",Saveyourself
26,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 1, 2021",0,"This medicine sure does get the job done for my recurring BV, but it tastes horrible when you take it. I would suggest taking it with something other than water because the taste has made me gag multiple times. DO NOT take this on an empty stomach. The first time I was prescribed this, my doctor didn't tell me to eat something with it and I was nauseous all week. Even just a small snack will work or a glass of milk. Make sure you finish your full dose though, because your BV will come right back if you don't. I also recommend using boric acid suppositories after your dose, They really helped clear the rest of my BV so that it wouldn't come back so often. Taking a probiotic with the pill also helps to get you back on track. This is just what works for me, it may not work for everyone.",Madie
27,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,9.0,,"June 28, 2021",0,"So this drug works!! I see all the crazy reviews on here and honestly with my experience I learned to just try it first before listening to all the reviews. A lot of symptoms I’ve seen people describe can also be from anxiety and a placebo effect of being nervous because of these reviews! Which I totally get having panic disorder. Of course everyone’s different so I don’t want to say they are being dramatic. I have had reoccurring BV since I was 16. I am now 22 and have never had a bad side effect from this drug. I’ve probably taken it about 7 different times. The only complaint I have is you absolutely cannot drink alcohol lol & the BV does eventually come back after I’m sexually active again without protection. That’s not the medications fault that’s just my vaginas sensitivity. I notice if I take a 10 billions probiotic regularly it reduces my chances of it coming back. I also suggest if this doesn’t work for you look of acv baths! Great for BV, eczema and dandruff.",Jaimeemariee99
28,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,8.0,,"June 24, 2021",0,"It took me so long to convince myself to start this medication due to the horrible reviews it has on here. I suffer from anxiety so I do lots of research before I take any new medication. Personally, I didn’t get much negative side effects, but I will give some useful tips. DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL ON AN EMPTY STOMACH. Seriously. You will be regretting your existence like I did one morning after taking it with nothing on my tummy. I was hugging the toilet for at least an hour. Also, avoid alcohol and propylene glycol. I never took it with either of those things so I don’t know what would happen if you did, but I can assume it wouldn’t be pretty. PROBIOTICS!!!Taking this med with a probiotic between doses also helped me a lot too, so I highly recommend doing so. I suspect it’s the reason I didn’t have any worsening anxiety or emotional side effects from this drug. Overall, my experience wasn’t bad. Just PLEASE for the love of GOD take this med with food and a probiotic lol",Tweckles

I felt extremely dizzy, nauseous, light headed AND heavy headed. I have been emotional for no reason with tears everyday, not being able to sleep, my mind racing at 100mph and just feeling restless and irritable in general. I literally felt out of my mind! I thought I was suffering from permanent mental illness,  my GP told me these weren’t side effects from metronidazole but reading other reviews I know my GP is are very very wrong ! I also experienced weakness and tingling in my arms and hands , I really hope I feel better this coming week as I’ve had a week of not feeling normal.

30,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,4.0,,"May 27, 2021",1,"So first off, I actually have no idea what my issue is. Thought it was a UTI, thought it was BV, but it seems to now be more serious? I have severe burning, flank pain and bloating. It doesn’t burn when I pee though? ANYWAY - I was prescribed this after a week of taking Macrobid that did not resolve my issue. I was only on this antibiotic for 2 days though, 2x 500 mg. This is a heavy duty antibiotic... I’m not sure if it was my anxiety acting up after reading the reviews, but I felt SO off on this. Just foggy and exhausted, I had a headache too. I actually didn’t really have any stomach issue that were so horrible, but I did have some chest pain and now my calves and feet feel so sore. I have no idea if that’s a side effect or not. I’m sure being on a full 7 day treatment of this would definitely kick my butt. Definitely take it with food and a probiotic and by no means DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL WITH IT, don’t even use mouth wash. Also, did not cure my problem.",kd5192

Like I said, having a full meal before taking it helps a lot. It works as intended.

I felt extremely nauseous these days and had a terrible headache. Finally finished it a couple days ago but still feeling nauseous, exhausted, and achy. Hoping these side effects go away soon, but I’m definitely not taking this medication ever again!

I took it last year and finished the course and got BV again. I tried to avoid taking the pill and was prescribed the vaginal gel. I took it everyday and it gave me weird clumpy reddish discharge and which I guess was a the BV infection. It didn't clear out my BV because less than a week later the signs of BV returned.

The side effects were terrible but I'm happy about the results (smell and discharge disappeared!).",pun_master_3000

I can't deal with this feeling much longer, I feel like I'm not in my own body anymore, I don't know what to do, I don't have med insurance to go see a therapist or any other doctor, so now I'll just have to tough it out & pray these side effects go away soon.

So I did this to have 0 loose stools & barely lowered mood: -Set up your phone alarm so you don't miss a dose. -Dose at equal times apart. Your body will benefits from consistent levels of antibiotics (AB). If you dose early, you get more side effects. If you dose late, bacteria can grow back. Example: For 2 doses per day, dose 24÷(2)=12 hours apart. -Take probiotics (PB) between your AB. AB kill both good & bad bacteria. Without good bacteria, your mood worsens (look up ""mood gut""). PB restores a healthy gut. I took AB twice a day; this was my alarm clock schedule: 10am-AB4pm-PB10pm-AB4am-PB (I'd wake up, eat a bit, dose, then back to sleep.) -Take all your AB.

Also for people with recurrent BV symptoms look into CV infections as well because some doctors don't know about it since it's not as common and some people get treated for BV for years when they really have CV cause the symptoms are very close.

I haven't had any side effects as of today, beside feeling tingling in the hands when I'm sleep and redness undertone of the skin. I too think its effective and I hope also that I don't incur any other infections after taking. Oh, plus I drink plenty of water while taking.",wdc
843,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,5.0,,"September 19, 2009",10,This antibiotic was very strong to me. Make sure that you eat before taking it. The bowel movements for me were very frequent and made me feel a little sick. I had to take it twice a day.,Iluvpink
844,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,8.0,,"September 6, 2009",20,"Due to itching, burning and discharge, I was told I had bacterial infection. I am on 500MG metronidazole twice a day X 7 days. The first few days of taking pill I was sick and dizzy. Third day I avoided taking pill so close to eating. That helped. I still get slightly dizzy around pill time. I drink with great tasting juice so I don't need to taste the pill. I feel that its improving my infection. I have two days left. Only side effect is slight diarrhea.",NC Annie

846,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,4.0,,"May 9, 2009",23,"I took one pill and was so close to gagging, that I called my pharmacy to see if there was another version they sold that including a coating on the pill.  Since there wasn't, I had to come up with an alternative if I was to ever get past the first dose. So I decided to coat the pill myself with peanut butter, which did the trick with helping that little rancid pill get down. I checked with the pharmacist, and he said it was okay to do that.  After I eat, I can still taste it a little, but it's nothing like it was before I coated it.",Anonymous
847,Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginosis,5.0,,"March 24, 2009",12,"I was experiencing a lot of discharge, itching and burning. The doctor verified that I had a vaginal bacterial infection.  The Metronidazol Tab 500 mg tablet was given to me for 7 days.  I feel sick to my stomach and dizzy most of the time.  The left side of my face feels a little numb.  The taste in my mouth is awful, but I chew gum to counteract it. I have 2 doses to take yet, and find it hard to swallow because of there is no coating on the tablets. Hopefully it did it's job without causing any other problems.",alittle scared

I'm starting to think maybe I'm dealing with an yeast infection that I probably got from it. Unpleasant pills that made these last few days a living hell for me.
