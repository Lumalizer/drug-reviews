0,Methylprednisolone,Nephropathy,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2022",0,"Took the first 4 days if the 4mg dose pack provided for my sciatica that was so bad. The pills did nothing for my pain but I had increased urination that made me go almost every 30 mins. The urination lasted about a week, but the feeling of having to pee all the time never left. It is coming up on 2 months since I've stopped taking the pills and I still have the feeling. Please avoid this pill, it is taking my will to live away with this feeling that won't leave. My biggest regret in life. Just wanted something for the pain and instead I'm struggling to keep going.",Random
