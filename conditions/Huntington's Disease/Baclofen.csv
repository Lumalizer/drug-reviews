0,Baclofen,Huntington's Disease,3,,"October 26, 2019",7,Taking baclofen for Huntington's disease and Woke up dizzy and out of it which  lasted all day. Can't take it as  I have a kid to care for and a job to go to. I’m not on my butt all day on disability where I can chill out on a sedative.  It wasn’t a Lifesaverlike some other reviewers on here say a lot.,Bactonothing
