0,Sulfacetamide ophthalmic,Conjunctivitis,6.0,,"November 5, 2016",5,Have to use this on my kids age 3 and 6. They don't like it. It burns. I have to fight with them each time we need to dose. Been on it for almost a week and still not over it.  Improvement but not cured. I was thinking after 48 hours we would be 80% there. Not so.,carmen carmen
