1,Fluoxetine,Binge Eating Disorder,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 3, 2021",5,Not a good experience for me. Increased hunger and severe mood swings that lead to suicidal thoughts.,Kat
2,Fluoxetine,Binge Eating Disorder,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 23, 2020",2,"I am on a dose of 80 mg of Prozac for major depressive disorder, and panic disorder and also I have a family history of compulsive eating disorders. While on Prozac, I would get up in the middle of the night and binge eat uncontrollably. Nothing I did was able to stop myself. It helped a lot with panic and depression, made me feel normal.",Jake
3,Fluoxetine,Binge Eating Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 29, 2020",84,"I’ve suffered with binge eating since I was a teenager and had a period of bulimia a few years ago. I was prescribed fluoxetine for severe depression though so I am absolutely delighted and surprised at the effect it has had on my obsessions with food. Within a few days I noticed that my desire for my binge food was waning and I didn’t get the high when I did eat it. It was only when I further looked into this drug that I realised it was used to treat eating disorders. My mood has gone from severely depressed and not being able to function, now I'm feeling fantastic. And as a happy accident I have zero food obsessions. I’m hungry at meal times and enjoy a normal portion- and then I’m full. Completely satisfied! It’s like a miracle for me.",Su
4,Fluoxetine,Binge Eating Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 19, 2020",44,"Fluoxetine is a life saver for my BED (binge eating disorder). Gives me energy to go through the day. Makes me more confident and the better version of myself. No anxiety, no intrusive thoughts and less obsessions with food. My dose was 60mg  and did wonders for my mental health.",Hugo
5,Fluoxetine,Binge Eating Disorder,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 22, 2019",10,"I'm 22 and I have been on this medication for exactly 12 days to treat BED, Anxiety and Depression. The first few days, I was binge free, then on the 4th day I started binging again. I've experience panic attacks, more depression and  I still cope with food although I feel lethargic (and I eat less amounts of food during an episode). I find it very difficult to go to work because  I am having trouble concentrating and experiencing extreme sadness. However, I am  PUSHING through because I read that it gets better! It takes time for the body to  adapt to this medication.",heythere
6,Fluoxetine,Binge Eating Disorder,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 24, 2019",16,"I took fluoxetine 10mg for 2 years in my early twenties and it worked great, coming off was very difficult though. I am 35 now, severe anxiety, attempted suicide, it has been 5 weeks on 20mg now and I see no improvement, very shaky, can start crying any time, I feel trapped inside and dissociated, had to quit working.",Cloudy84
7,Fluoxetine,Binge Eating Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 22, 2019",49,"I’ve been taking fluoxetine for 2 months now. I started at 20mg and notice a drastic decrease in appetite where I could go a day without eating and not even realise which was different from me binging every weekend.  I also notice the first two weeks in taking it I was tired all day even though I could get up to 12 hours of sleep. I started to notice my appetite come back after a month so I upped my dosage to 40mg which helped my appetite again. Since the two months I’ve only binged once and was not nearly as big of a binge as before. I’m starting on 60mg now which is the dose for eating disorders  and I feel like I can stop eating whenever I want and don’t have an obsession over food anymore. I do have most of the side effects like nausea, headaches, vision changes, decreased sex drive, tired feeling and YAWNING. Overall it has helped my appetite decrease to a happy amount where I don’t feel the need to binge anymore",Aimee
8,Fluoxetine,Binge Eating Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 4, 2018",73,"Growing up, I was on a lot of different meds to combat depression and anxiety. My eating issues were less obvious then, since I exercised all the time and could eat whatever I wanted. My symptoms finally felt under control around the age of 20. I stopped all my meds and soon after developed hardcore binge eating disorder. I gained 40 lbs and still did not make the connection. At the age of 23, I realized my weight gain and apathy were causing depressive symptoms. I was prescribed fluoxetine: a prescription I’d had in 2nd grade, and my very first medication. Not only did it take a huge weight off my shoulders, but my obsession with food and eating until I could burst entirely stopped. Don’t underestimate how much mood affects appetite, and don’t underestimate how sneaky depression can be. It took about 6 weeks for the results but I’m down 29 lbs and not from a restrictive diet. I can honestly say if my brain chemistry stays stable, I will never binge again.",Misa anthropic
9,Fluoxetine,Binge Eating Disorder,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 23, 2018",23,"I started taking fluoxetine a few months ago.  I noticed I gained about 10 pounds but I am dropping off now and wow, the binge eating is gone!!!  I take 20mg every morning.  I first started taking it at night and slept like a baby, but once it kicked in, I was up all night for 3 nights (which it did say it would do that).  I am starting to feel a little crabby and on edge and not sure if I should increase it a bit.  I will check with doctor.  Definitely taking it during the day right after some breakfast works best for me.",LS
10,Fluoxetine,Binge Eating Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 26, 2016",46,"I am on prozac for 5 weeks now, no relapse of binge ever since. But i have experienced some side effects like lack of energy, insomnia, nausea, and dry mouth. Some of them went away. Hope within time all of them go away. I will recommend it to people who suffer from binge eating. It noticeably reduced my appetite from the third day. My obssession over food can finally be stopped. I am really happy with this medication. Started at 20 mg in 1st week, upped to 40 mg in 2nd, then 60 mg in 3rd.",ichbinwendylein
11,Fluoxetine,Binge Eating Disorder,10.0,,"July 9, 2015",91,"Cured me from years of binge eating that I thought would be with me until I died. I can now say I am extremely happy and healthy and binge free! It took me about a month and a half to feel the drugs effect so please DON'T GIVE UP! I did have terrible side effects for the first 6 weeks such as stomach ache, drowsiness, bad dreams, lack of energy. But these all wore off gradually and it was so worth it!!",Jennylack90
12,Fluoxetine,Binge Eating Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 2, 2015",52,"I began taking Prozac ~8 weeks ago for mild depression. At the last minute I learned it may also help with Binge Eating Disorder, which I've struggled with for 25 years.  Within 3 days of taking 10mg/day, I had zero obsession with food.  I ate, but easily stopped after 2 oreos, no joke, it felt like a total miracle!  However at ~7 weeks, I realized I'd started a binge cycle again, and ate everything in sight for about a week.  I suspect my dose is too low and my brain adjusted and no longer benefits from my 10 mg.  I'm started taking a 2nd pill every other day for an avg dose of 15mg in hopes of getting back to that sweet spot with my BED.  I read most folks don't see Prozac work for BED until 60mg, has anyone had luck taking less?",jwatinCO
