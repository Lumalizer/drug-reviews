0,Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 25, 2022",0,I've been on Vyvanse for 3 months now and it has done very little. I was prescribed it for my ADHD and BED but it did not suppress my appetite and it remained the same. It varies from person to person probably but for me it did not do anything for my appetite or my concentration.,Ryan
1,Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorder,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 28, 2022",1,"Female, 24, I started Vyvanse 20mg at 236lb in October 2019. I was prescribed for both ADHD and binge eating. The first day I started Vyvanse, was immediate. After a week I realized I wasn't eating when I wanted to, but when I needed to. After 6 months I didn't notice a huge weight loss, mind you, I just turned 21 and still casually drank here and there every other weekend with friends. (I do not condone alcohol use while using taking Vyvanse) So I talked with my provider and she increased me to 40mg. After about 9 months, I eventually lost my craving for huge portions, certain foods, sweets, and carbonated beverages. After a year and a half, my provider increased my dose to 50mg due to study related issues. Every now and then I won't take Vyvanse on the weekends because it has the capability, in my medication management experience, to completely diminish my appetite (and I like to eat) By a year and a half, I had lost about 50lbs, healthily maintaining my weight at 184lb.",Bailey

Vyvanse is an off label treatment for Narcolepsy. It helps but it's not a cure all and I'm still tired much of the time BUT it has  completely eliminated my binge eating and cravings. July 1 I was 235lb and I'm now 190lb and still using. Very happy with this medication for BED, but not quite as much for Narcolepsy.",Kristi
3,Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 4, 2022",6,"I'm a 32 year old male. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 19 and prescribed adderall. I tried 2 or 3 other ADHD medications and none of them helped or made me feel like a robot. I also have depression, sleep apnea, and have weighed around 350-390 for the past 10 years. I constantly think about food and will not stop eating until the food in my house is gone. To keep myself from ballooning even more, I only buy what I need for the day.Vyvanse is a miracle drug for me. It completely stops my thoughts of binge eating. I still get hungry but I now feel like I can control when I eat. It also makes me feel 'normal'. My brain can focus on things now. My thinking feels sharper and quicker and I'm more fluid in my conversations. For the first time in my life I also feel like I have energy. No more do I feel like I'm more tired after sleeping when I take this pill. It has cured damn near everything wrong with my brain. Hopefully I can lose 150 pounds and get my life back. 1 month on it.",John H
4,Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 9, 2021",5,"I gained 55 lbs in 9 months, and was only diagnosed 4 days ago with BED and ADHD. The dr put me on vyvanse and I am already down 8 lbs in 3 days. I haven't had the urge to binge, and I haven't even taken my as per needed anxiety medication in 3 days! I am on the lowest dose and I also feel like I have been better focused at work. I wasn't expecting weight loss, I was honestly just desperate to stop binge eating. I guess I will see where 30 days takes me, as I check back in with my dr then. No stomach upset, no headaches, actually no side effects yet, other than the good ones! I even sleep fine, my mind isn't racing and despite the warnings, I fall asleep faster, just a little later than normal. I feel good. And it's been a long time.",CANDACE

I've never gone so long without an eating binge. My partner has commented on how much happier and more focused I am. Instant improvement in my life.",Brigitte
6,Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 24, 2021",1,"For BED: Took away hunger at first but it tapered off. Made it more difficult to focus on recovery due to not being hungry and restricting.Other: It helped my productivity and energy but also tapered off, pretty severe crashes mid afternoon, increased anxiety, light sensitivity, really improved my mood overall. It might also be raising my blood pressure which is a concern. I also highly do not recommend taking Vyvanse if you have no insurance, it is very expensive. In Canada Vyvanse does offer a discount if you need it, and allows you a 30 day free trial- so please ask your doctor about this first!",Oooooohy164
7,Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorder,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 5, 2021",0,"I was prescribed vyvanse for binge eating disorder. I've tried it off and on over the last 4 years. Every single time I tried it I ended up gaining weight. I know that many people do not have this experience, but for me, every time I've been on vyvanse I've gained weight... even when exercising regularly and eating healthy. It does help to curb my appetite, but for some reason, I end up gaining weight on it. 6 months ago I thought I'd try it again out of desperation for help with my bingeing. It did help with my bingeing, but I've gained almost 40 lbs!!! I'm trying to get off of it again so I can at the very least stop gaining weight.",Tammy

I was at 269lb when I started this medication  now I am at 238lb and I have loss 31 pounds. I have a lot of energy when I take it and  when I don't take it I don't and I want to eat a lot because that is how I deal with depression.  I am so happy for this medication  it works good for me .

9,Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 15, 2021",6,"I have ADHD and binge eating disorder and this drug is a miracle worker. I started showing ADHD symptoms in childhood but wasn't diagnosed into adulthood. When I was eleven I started binge eating and struggling with impulse control around food I was never medically heavy but I always wondered why I was a little bit bigger and seemed to eat way more than others even if I wasn't necessarily hungry. I would eat a lot of the time when I was bored, upset or stressed and wouldn't really be paying attention to how much I was eating. When I was 24 my ADHD and binge eating symptoms got out of control so I decided to try vyvanse. It is expensive but it is worth the price",sarahs
10,Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 25, 2021",17,"Well I’m teen and I actually got prescribed Vyvanse for my ADHD later to realize that it also is used for binge eating disorder. I didn’t know until I looked at a side effects sheet and then I realized that my appetite is slowing down drastically and currently I’ve lost about 80 or so lbs. My highest weight being 239lbs  I’m 5’9 and now I weigh about 153lb to say the least, and I’m still 5’9. This drug has changed my life literally and while I was loosing weight I would try to eat healthy since it took nothing to make me full. But I’ve fallen off badly and I don’t want to start eating only little portions of junk food because it’s not healthy. To sum it all up this drug is very effective and I don’t think I could lose all this weight without it.",Keny

Yes I lost a lot of weight and didn’t have an appetite for a little while and I thought wow what a miracle I feel great, of course I felt great I was losing weight with no effort and was also high on stimulants!! It’s been over a year now and it doesn’t work anymore and I’ve been on the highest dose for a while now. I’ve gained all the weight back. DO NOT expect this to be a miracle...LONG TERM EFFECTIVENESS is a big issue.",jenesaiquois
12,Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorder,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 13, 2021",18,"Vyvanse was a miracle drug for me for about 6 months but the appetite suppression has mostly worn off and I'm back to bingeing and obsessive thoughts about weight and food, esp because after losing 50lbs, I'm so worried I'm going to gain it back. My doctor didn't tell me at the start that the appetite suppression doesn't last.  I wish I could get back that feeling I had where I wasn't thinking about food all the time and I felt NORMAL. Doctor said I can increase my dose (I'm at 40mg) but what happens when I get to the max dosage and my body gets used to that??",DeeDee
13,Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorder,10.0,,"February 25, 2021",7,"I have been on Vyvanse for only a month. I was prescribed 30mg to start. 30mg worked for me for the first two weeks. After that it stopped working. I increased the dosage to 40mg. One-month Pros: * Throughout the day, food isn't my first or only thought. * Reduced appetite.  * I can feel when I've had enough to eat.  * My first two weeks I lost 6lbs. * Though I typically have a hard time falling asleep, the side effect of insomnia did not worsen. * Concentration. My ability to concentrate is amazingly better.  One-month Cons: * My arms and legs have become itchier. * Dry mouth.  * I already have dizziness, Vyvanse does not seem to affect it any more than usual. * Irritability. This only lasted for about a day or two. * Upper stomach pain. Only lasted for about 1 week and was tolerable.   ** I did NOT research about alcohol and this drug before taking it.

14,Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorder,10.0,,"February 4, 2021",158,"I recently stopped Adderal after attempting to quit for years. So I was skeptical about trying this.. because I did not want to be disappointed.I read through the reviews & was desperate for anything. I got prescribed 60mg bc that’s the dosage of adderal I took before. A week later, & I want to cry with joy. I feel NORMAL. I’m hungry when I should be & not when I shouldn’t. I don’t care for sweets AT ALL. I don’t feel anxiety or depressed anymore. I feel genuinely happy & focus on what’s really important, etc. I feel in control. My view on my body and what it does for me has completely changed (hence the ‘I feel pretty’ movie). I know everyone reacts differently to medications, but this saved my life. I hope it continues, because I have never felt so much gratitude, peace, happiness and in control as I do now. I hope everyone who is struggling out there can read this and know you are not alone... and that there is indeed hope.",Lili
15,Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorder,9.0,,"December 3, 2020",100,"After taking adderall (which got rid of my appetite), I developed an awful binge/restrict eating cycle and had to stop taking it, but the BED stayed. I gained 100lb in a year and finally decided to try Vyvanse to curb the habit & I don’t think I’ll ever look back. I don’t get the  jitters, nausea, and crashes that I did before, so don’t necessarily let negative experiences with stimulants deter you. I can still eat, but I can’t binge at ALL. Even if I am very stressed/bored and I emotionally feel like I want a binge, it’s almost like Vyvanse is blocking my consciousness from entering that state. With active habits and healthy eating, I have lost all that weight in just under half a year. I feel like I finally have control over my mind and my body, and nothing has felt so liberating! Note: if you have high BP or are very prone to anxiety, this may not be your fav. I am very anxious and find that at times it exacerbates my anxiety, but I stay at a low dose (20 mg) to mitigate that.",Cybrbii

18,Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 6, 2020",21,"Started taking 30 mg  Vyvanse two months ago for Binge eating disorder and it works great!  I’ve lost 10 pounds so far.  I was crashing pretty early and couldn’t function later in the day, so I started taking it at noon and incorporated a small coffee in the morning to get me by until noon and I haven’t crashed since!  Did affect my moods pretty bad for a few weeks, but I seem to be levelled out now.  It does significantly raise my blood pressure and bp, unfortunately. I’ve always had pretty low pressure and bp and now it runs 130/80 in afternoon after I take it.  It used to run like 110/70 and even in double digits sometimes. BP is running in the 70s-110s resting, which is scary. It used to run in the lower 60s. Maybe I should add a beta-blocker?  It is worth it to me, though.",Opl

Weight has gone up and down countless times depending on if I'm in my healthy mode or my bingeing mode. Started Vyvanse 6 months ago and didn't think it worked at first, so stopped. Tried it again and this time it clicked. I can feel when my body is satiated AND am able to stop eating. I can go an entire day and not think about food, which is a miracle. I think this must be how it feels for 'normal' people.",Dee dee
20,Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 30, 2020",51,"I've been on Vyvanse for almost 2 years now for both binge eating & ADD. I started on 10mg and am now at 60mg. At first, the 10mg worked great. That lasted about 2 months before I saw both my BED and ADD symptoms coming back. Increased to 20mg which lasted about 2 months, the 30mg lasted about 3 months, 40mg worked for 4 months (you get the picture). This was very worrisome for me, because it felt like, at the maximum dosage, it might eventually not work at all. I'm on 60mg now, and have been for the past 5 months, and I finally feel that I'm at a dosage that makes binge eating truly manageable (I no longer have any issues with ADD while the medication is working). So if you're on 20-40mg of Vyvanse and it isn't working, increase the dosage. The 60mg somehow made a huge difference. My psych also added 100mg Wellbutrin SR and that has been a life changer. The two medicines together completely curb my appetite (and the bonus is the Wellbutrin covers both my depression & anxiety as well).",Lisa

My restricting and binging were severe at times. It’s honestly about mentality and education in healthy living and eating moderately, and talks of nutrients and stuff.

It is the only thing that's helped me stop bingeing, therapy has never worked. It lifts the mental fog that usually clouds my judgement and leads to a binge, helps me understand my body's ""I'm full"" cues, and reduces cravings. Now that I've fully committed to take it daily, its even helped me challenge my worst disordered food fears. In the past when I lost weight I only ate low calorie unhealthy foods, but now I have the ability to challenge myself to eat healthy too, without being scared.",Laura

Began on 10mg; increased by 10mg every few days. While on 10 & 20, I had the ""Vyvanese crash. Doctors are often bad informing about some side effects, so be aware. Irritability and anger, hating everything, in evenings. Also an ungrounded, unsettled feeling in evening as drug wore off. But all would go away by morning, AND it disappeared once I went up to 30 mg daily. Just note in case it happens to you.Went up to 40 mg. Next morning at 5 a.m., awoke itching badly. Looked online and found a few reports of this odd effect where, when the medicine wore off, itching would begin.Doc said to stop. Will never know if the itching might have abated, but from what I saw online, very unlikely. Had no benefit at that dose yet.Saw reports that stimulants can lower serotonin eventually.

As for side effects, dry mouth is really the only thing. I still need 2 alarms to wake up, when my doctor asked if I'd be able to sleep. No mood changes or anything else.

I am a 23 year old male who suffers from BDD and eating disorder (bulimia). My thoughts on the medication are that it gives me a much needed boost of energy, I can concentrate a lot on the things I want to. I also lost 5lbs on this (I am 120lb now). I feel that the medication is appropriate for my condition. Given that I eat 3-4 planned meals a day, I wonder if it should be increased.

I was still binge eating really bad. After a few months I went up to 40 mg. That is when I really started to notice a difference. It didn't really stop the urge to binge, but it made my stomach hurt so bad after eating a normal amount of food that there was no way I could binge. It has been 9 months and I am down 50 pounds. I still have about another 60 to 70 pounds to go, but I don't really binge eat anymore. I was thinking I needed to go up in dose again, but I didn't want to do that, so I stopped taking it for a week.

I was prescribed a dose of 20 mg Vyvanse which didn't help much, then 30 mg, ultimately 50mg. If I took it too early, it wore off. I'd crash or cravings came roaring back at night (my worst time).  Take it too late, I'm wired and unable to sleep. It is trial and error to find the right dose AND right timing. For me, it's 9-10 AM at 40 mg. I don't take it every day. I go without it for weeks, and if I have a binge cycle - not one bad day, but a few in a row - I go back on for a few days until I get my eating under control. Side effects - moving my tongue at higher doses. I drink a lot of water, and it does ""stimulate"" my GI tract. My provider said drinking OJ or grapefruit juice will flush from your system more quickly if you can't sleep. It's a tool to help manage BE, but you still need to do the behavioral modifications.

Please understand that this is not a weight loss medication, although for me it has made me lose just a few pounds and maintaining that.  It makes me work harder, stay awake and I lose my appetite. For me I eat a large breakfast before taking it because it’s usually the only meal I eat until dinner.  I don’t binge while on the medication. I am recovering from bulimia and binge eating disorder. My doctor recommended me take this while also weekly or bi weekly therapy sessions. I haven’t been going to therapy and only take the pill 4-5x a week unless other things come up.

36,Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorder,1.0,,"October 5, 2019",14,"It didn’t consistently help with bingeing, for those in a binge restrict cycle, I’m don’t think it’s helpful as appetite suppression. Increases restriction and when it wears off,  bingeing comes back. I binged while on it which was a horrible experience as all the sugar acted as an extra stimulant and I spent the whole day with racing pulse. Final straw after taking 40mg (which I’d taken before) my BP shot up to 168/103. This scared me as it did not show signs of coming down. I was so scared it would continue to increase I even drove myself to sit outside the emergency department just in case. That whole afternoon it kept spiking to a very high blood pressure. I’d rather binge eat than have a stroke. It’s been a real wake up call.

Around sept. 2015 I was put on vyvanse (30mg, which has since then been upped to 70mg) along w/topamax (50mg 2x day) & lexapro (20mg). For the most part vyvanse has worked wonders. It makes me feel picky about food which is good & bad. Good in the sense that I won't eat the house, bad because I can be starving but nothing seems appetizing. I'd rather starve than eat the house tho.

Nothing ever worked for me until Vyvanse. The biggest thing for me is that I no longer obsess over food. I would think about food all day long and all night until I managed to fall asleep. I never knew what hunger truly was because I always used food to control my emotions. Vyvanse controls the compulsions and obsessions I once had over food. An added plus is that I've lost 8 pounds in about 3 weeks since I've started taking it. I no longer binge and its the strangest yet most incredible feeling in the world. I would have rated this a 10 but I'm only 3 wks in so hopefully the effects are long lasting.,aurora45789

Therapy, meditation, exercise, nothing could break the cycle. I heard about Vyvanse and talked to my doctor. Because of how rapidly I was gaining weight and how out of control I was, he happily prescribed it. Honestly it was hard at first - it made me feel sedated and tired, and I had headaches and dry mouth. But the binging was gone from day ONE. My dosage is leveled out now and my body has adjusted and I have lost 25 lbs in 6 weeks. It has changed my life for the better! I have no emotional connection to food now.",always1986

After switching to 30mg -60mg every other month, to try to find the right doseage, I finally realized the drug wasn't worth the crash.My psychitarist told me that the crashes were so intense due to the fact that I did not have ADHD so the chemical imbalance is what caused the crash.However, if you are on this drug and do feel the crashes, I've tried a lot of things to help combat it, the one that works the best is to drink water. 1L a day",hannahmo00
