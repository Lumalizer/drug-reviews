0,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 1, 2022",0,"4 nasal surgeries to remove polyps. Most of 2021 I was unable to smell or taste The only time things cleared up are with prednisone, last two prednisone courses did not allow me to regain smell or taste. After my very first shot, I was starting to smell things later that night. Next morning I was able to smell and taste once again and haven’t lost it yet, even when battling a cold. (8 weeks) The shot does hurt, make sure it’s at room temp and that helps. I don’t mind shots but I’m still not comfortable doing it myself due to how much it hurts. My eyes are fine but I noticed gunk in my eyes when waking up in the AM no big deal. No vision problems. Only real negative thing is around 3 days prior to the shot my back and joints are stiff. No pain but sore. After the shot, no problems. I’m still on allergy and asthma meds. No asthma problems, allergies no Change.",Seanp
1,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,10,,"December 15, 2021",4,"I’ve had CRSwP for many years with asthma and allergy to ibuprofen. I couldn’t sleep. I choked when I was eating ( couldn’t breathe and eat at the same time) My consonants we’re so blunted I couldn’t be understood on the phone esp with a mask) I stopped singing in a choir cuz I had no resonance, I worried about my immunity during covid while on prednisone. I was tired all the time but still had to keep doing a demanding job.The prednisone worked wonders the first and 3rd time ( for a couple of months) but was completely ineffective during the spring with worst allergies. I lost my smell. Which I need in my work. Prednisone brought it back briefly but big risk in a pandemic. First dose of dupixent 4 days  ago and my smell is back, I can breath through both nares , unbelievable! Hoping for the best! Smelling is like seeing in colour!",Anonymous
2,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,6,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 27, 2021",4,"After 4 sinus surgeries in 8 years and numerous rounds of steroids and antibiotics for terrible sinus misery, I was happy to try Dupixent. I started noticing a change for the better with my sinuses after the third 300 mg injection. Unfortunately, I started having muscle/joint aches, stomach soreness, and eyelash loss in May.  Stopped it in June and then restarted in September, since my sinus symptoms had returned and my ENT thought I should retry. Once again, I felt so much better sinus-wise, but the side effects did return.  I’m still taking Dupixent but deciding   what to do. I’m wondering if the side effects will eventually go away the longer I stay on it. I can say it has definitely helped my sinuses, but the rest of my body is taking a hit so I’m disappointed in that respect. For those of you on the fence about it, it’s definitely worth trying for your sinus disease but just hope you don’t get any of the possible side effects. You may not!",Rachel
3,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 11, 2021",3,"This medication has been life changing.  I've had severe asthma as well as nasal polyps for almost two decades.  I've struggled to breathe and had two sinus surgeries to remove polyps, but they grew right back.  I had no sense of smell for many years.  7 days after starting Dupixent, I had noticeably clearer sinuses and after a few months of treatment, I can easily breathe and have a sense of smell and taste.  I am no longer struggling with asthma daily or struggling to breathe through my sinuses.  Dupixent gave my quality of life back!",Anonymous

5,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 29, 2021",7,"Started Dupixent October 2021.  2013 I was diagnosed with chronic sinus polyps. I had some removed in 2014.  I had a catscan in 2016 and the image was completely white!! I was full so full I had vertigo, could not sleep I was absolutely exhausted. Went for surgery November 2016. That was the best gift ever - in 2019 the polyps came back. I did a round of prednisone - and was on pulmicort applied by laying back as it was shot up my nasal cavity.  Lots of steroids. I went to an allergist and found out I was allergic to pollen & grass. In 2020 the polyps got worse and I was booked for surgery. In August of 2021 my ENT told me about Dupixent- I applied for it and started in October- I had 2 shots so far. My sense of smell came back in one week. I can feel it working and my sinuses are opening up. However the side effects I am having include headaches, insomnia (very bad) dryness of my nasal passages, dry mouth. It’s only been 2 weeks so far. I’ll post an update in a month or so.",Candace
6,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 4, 2021",8,"I had surgery to remove nasal polyps two years and three months ago. I was told to go on allergy injections and nasal steroids to reduce the chance that the polyps would come back. Well, they have. They said my sinuses are worse now than they were two years ago and recommended I start Dupixent immediately. I had my first injection (auto-inject pin) one week ago. It felt like someone asked me to allow someone to put out their lit cigar on my leg and hold it there for 30 seconds. It was unbelievably painful. I've also started to notice subtle changes in my vision; not sure if it's possible that I could have problems with my sight after just one dose. Right now, I'm trying to decide whether or not I can possibly psyche myself up for another dose. Yes, I want to taste and smell, but surely there is a more humane way to address this problem?",allymcreal
7,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 29, 2021",21,"At the start of the pandemic I got a sore throat,  post nasal drip and cough. Naturally no one wanted to see me. Months go by and the symptoms persist and I finally get to see an ENT, allergist, gastro doc, everybody. Turns out I'm allergic to every tree known to man. Lol. Finally after steroids, antibiotics, nasal sprays I get to get a CT scan.. oh boy. My entire sinus cavity is littered with polyps. And after being told surgery is the only thing that'll work and that we're gonna have to do a full turbectomy I said let me get a second opinion. New ENT doc said, try dupixent. Started it in January it is now end of April and almost all of the polyps are gone. I did also have to go on emeprozole for Gerd but finally, 14 months later all my symptoms are gone. Dupixent is legit!",Buddy
8,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 23, 2021",16,"Well I like many others  I see reviews from, suffer from nasal polyps. I have been dealing with them for over 10 years. I have had 2 surgeries (in patient) and 1 out patient surgeries.  Still my polyps return.  I have been without sense of smell and taste for the whole 10 years.  Well this passed Wed I got my first 2 injections of dupixent and the next day I am able to smell odors.   I was so excited I went to out spice drawer and able to smell things I have missed for a decade. Thank you so much for this medicine and I hope I just continue to improve.",CT
9,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 17, 2021",16,"I’ve been Dupixent for nearly one year for treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by mast cell activation syndrome. We are now at peak spring allergy season and I feel like so much better than past allergy seasons. Prior to treatment with Dupixent, I lived in a vicious cycle of absolute misery followed by steroid treatment followed by misery. Dupixent has improved my quality of life.",MCASer
10,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 3, 2021",52,I have had nose polyps for 14 years. I have had 1-2 surgeries every year to have them removed.I have had no smell or taste for years. After every surgery within 3-4 months my polyps return. I have been miserable for many years. I have tried many different things to help. But nothing has worked. So after this last surgery in Dec I approached my ENT about Dupinxent. I have been taking it for 6 weeks / 3 injections and feel great! So far so good. No side effects and for once in 14 years I can smell and taste. I' m looking forward to having my sense of smell and taste for a long time...lol I'm glad it's working! Fingers crossed!,Anonymous
11,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 30, 2021",20,Started the Dupixent 300mg shots in Nov. 2020 when my I was referred to a Pulmonologist by my primary. Kept getting lung infections and a round of antibiotics and prednisone only to see it come back every 4-6 weeks. All precipitated by a sinus infection and more antibiotics. The past 18 months was brutal with asthma exacerbations and sinus infections. I have had two sinus surgeries since 2009. Also have been on allergy shots. My Pulmonologist finally diagnosed me with Eosinophilic Asthma. I’m at 10 weeks now and can say that my sinuses inflammation is almost non existent and my congestion is less and less every week. I did not expect my sinus symptoms to nearly be gone. Dupixent is a game changer!,JF13
12,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 10, 2020",38,I have had Chronic Sinus issues and nasal polyps for about 14 years and have had 4 sinus surgeries.  Not wanting to have a 5th surgery since they never seem to be successful for long my ENT suggested I try Dupixent.  I started in July and was able to start feeling a difference with my sinuses within 4 weeks!  After about 8 weeks of Dupixent ( 4injections) my smell and taste came back and  I was able to start sleeping again without waking up every hour to blow my nose.  I also have asthma and it has helped me with that as well.   After years of suffering this has been pretty life changing.,Jen
13,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,9,,"December 7, 2020",24,"I started Dupixent about 2 months ago. I have received 4 injections so far.  I have suffered from absolutely terrible allergies, nasal polyps, and asthma for the last 6-7 years. Also was diagnosed with AERD. Tried every medicine possible. Was on prednisone all the time. Which caused terrible weight gain, etc. I am now 23 years old. About 4 yrs ago I had major sinus surgery due to severe nasal polyps. It helped greatly at the time. Over the last year my symptoms started up again and my polyps & asthma had came back. My ENT decided to start me on Dupixent, after a dose a steroids. So far Dupixent is a LIFESAVER for me!! I haven't used my inhaler for weeks (except for when I exercise)  only have to use my steroid inhaler once a day. I have been able to cut back on my decongestant meds. I can also finally sleep at night w/out coughing or waking up wheezing! It's a life saver! I feel almost normal again! Haven't experienced any bad side effects yet",Ark23

15,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 18, 2020",46,"I developed nasal polyps about 5-6 years ago, took oral steroids every six months to knock them down but they'd come back in 3-4 months. Had one surgery to remove them, but again, they came right back. Asked my asthma doc about Dupixent since I have both polyps and eosinophilic asthma. The asthma is now controlled to the point where I only need a rescue inhaler, and the polyps disappeared right after the third dose. I can now breathe normally, no stuffy/runny nose, and no issues with alcohol sending my polyps into overdrive. After 8 months, no side effects experienced, so I'm very happy with Dupixent!",RWD
16,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 1, 2020",19,I’ve dealt with nasal polyps 7 years. In the fall of 2019 I came across an article about dupixent. I asked my ENT about it and have been on it since. I feel like a new person. Once in awhile I can feel the polyps but I’ve had my smell and taste all year!  It’s amazing and has changed my life. Only side affect  I have experienced is some itching on my shins and calves.,Tammy
17,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 26, 2020",19,"This drug absolutely changed my quality of life. I started to get chronic sinus infections 4 times a year when I was 15. After a surgery, about 5 courses of oral steroids every single year with no cure in sight, my doctor finally suggested I start with Dupixent. After 4 injections, my ENT scoped me and was in shock. She told me I was the healthiest she has ever seen me in 7 years and I had a dramatic change in my sinuses. I cannot be more thankful for this medicine. As a 22 year old woman, my health issues were dominating my life. To feel them become a non issue is an amazing feeling!!!!",Katie

I have tried everything you can think of, to manage my nasal polyps. I tried Dupixent and it changed my life. In one week after my first Dupixent shot I could feel a positive change in my nasal airway. After another six weeks I could smell and taste. My allergist doctor said I was a super reactive patient to Dupixent, in a positive way. I want to say Thank You to the makers Dupixent.",MLB
19,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 28, 2020",25,I have been dealing with nasal polyps for the past 4 years. I have had surgery 3 times and ever since my allergist prescribed Dupixent in the fall of 2018 I have not needed another surgery or even a dose of oral steroids.

20,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 26, 2020",17,"On Dupixent since January.  Had seemed to help with sinusitis, however after 3 or 4 injections I have become extremely fatigued and tired after any effort or exercise.   This is very unusual for me even though I am 81.  Not sure if Dupixent is the problem since I have a very slow heart rate when at rest.  May stop the medication temporarily.",Ron
21,Dupixent,Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps,1,,"April 12, 2020",33,My dr gave me Dupixent in hope of clearing up chronic sinuses. By the fourth shot I told her I was getting headaches and contributed to this drug. She disagreed and administered a fifth shot but I said I was through with the drug if I get headaches. After about a week the headaches came back to the extreme. It’s been five weeks now and I am still suffering along with other side effects. One would have to be crazy to take this drug and deal with the pain and anxiety that I am going through.,Tobad
