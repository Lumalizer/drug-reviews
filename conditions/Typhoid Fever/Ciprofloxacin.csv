0,Ciprofloxacin,Typhoid Fever,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2020",10,"I got Salmonella poisoning in my blood (Sepsis). It seems the only means I could have contracted it, is by my Gecko. Salmonella lives in the gut of certain animals and doesn't bother them. Cipro is the only antibiotic helping me. I have not had any negative side-effects. This is my 5th antibiotic. Once my blood cultures grew enough to identify the actual strain, this is the one that is helping me. No more high fever and diarrhea is somewhat better. Salmonella Sepsis can be very lethal and also causes many biological problems.",Becca
