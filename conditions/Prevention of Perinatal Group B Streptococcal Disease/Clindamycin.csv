0,Clindamycin,Prevention of Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease,9,,"March 1, 2014",13,"I'm 31, I have my tonsils and I have never had any problems with my ears/nose/throat. I was prescribed amoxicillin. The doctor said I was not responding to amoxicillin, the strep was antibiotic resistant, I now had 2 ear infections and was in danger of the strep causing heart or kidney damage. I take clindamycin 300mg 3X a day, I've been on it 3 days and will be taking it a total of 10 days. I experienced diarrhea the first day only. Then again I am not eating much either.  My throat is improving, ears too. An added bonus is that my complexion is clear.",ny585girl
