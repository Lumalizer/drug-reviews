0,Clonidine,Insomnia Stimulant-Associated,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 30, 2022",0,"It usually takes 2-4 hours to fall asleep, usually get 3-6 hours before I wake and rarely get back to sleep unless I can sleep in, in which case I spend 6-10hrs more in bed and a bit more sleep. melatonin was ineffective.Taking 0.2mg clonidine at night knocks me out hard with ~10hr sleep, but gives massive nausea and faintness when standing (fine when lying down), this continues into the next day and overall I prefer not sleepingTaking 0.1mg clonidine (~2 hour before bed) reduces the time to fall asleep to 0.5-1.5hr, I still wake up hours before I have to get up without falling back asleep, when I get up I get minor nausea and faintness symptoms which a morning coffee fixes wellAlthough 0.1mg isn't a cure, I am very satisfied with the extra couple of hours of sleep, I would recommend finding the max fully tolerable dose for you (e.g. 0.05, 0.075, 0.1mg) and seeing if its any help at all, a minor improvement with negligible side effects is better than nothing",Morgan

I'd take it at night, I'd wake up after 10 hours feeling refreshed (a bit light headed) but it was perfect for me. I get anxiety and attacks at night, and clonidine would keep all of that away for the night. However, after about a year, I started waking up after 3-4 hours of sleep and not feeling refreshed. And if you want to get off of it, prepare for HELL. Constant anxiety/panic attacks, insomnia for days, hallucinations, etc.",bpd_ptsd_anxiet

While that did the job, it did it a little too well considering I woke up groggy every morning. I spoke to my psychiatrist and he prescribed clonidine .2mg which has changed my life! I can take it early or late in the night and it will knock me out within 30 minutes, give me uninterrupted sleep & not leave me drowsy in the morning. My psychiatrist told me it’s to help my body fall asleep but not stay asleep since I can rest deeply on my own with a little help.",lifesaver

(Prison Guard)Then 2 years ago I was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. Both of these issues really mess with sleep. My Psychiatrist had me on Quetiapine 100mg at night and 50mg Extended release during the day. The Quetiapine caused me to have the most realistic , violent dreams. To the point that I was physically and verbally abusing my husband in my sleep, what little sleep I was having. I started on Clonidine at night along with the Quetiapine and have not slept this well in years, and no more violent dreams. It has been a life changer for me.",Jay
5,Clonidine,Insomnia Stimulant-Associated,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 22, 2021",6,"I was prescribed clonidine after 7 years of taking seroquel 200mg. This was because I had built a large tolerance to seroquel and needed an extra kick to knock me out. I have always suffered from mania and insomnia, and could even go days without sleep. When I first started taking this, I finally started sleeping again. That never stopped, but what did start was every morning I was COMPLETELY hungover from both medications for about 6 hours a day. I would have to sleep for 11+ hours just to sleep off the hangover, and of course life often doesn’t let you do that. I am considering getting off of clonodine simply because it feels like I’m in a video game, blurred vision, and nothing feels real. I have no clue how I’m allowed to drive on both drugs. I’m so impaired. Not to mention the morning sickness. Every single morning I wake up with bouts of nausea and even sometimes vomiting. It is torturous, and I wish I could live normally again. Nothing feels real anymore.",Cloveerika

Don’t get me wrong - I have heard wonderful things about this medicine and I know it works wonders for some. I definitely felt tired and it put me to sleep for a bit... but I ended up still waking up, and when I got up to use the restroom in the middle of the night, I felt a light-headed feeling, like I was about to pass out. I immediately laid down and it stopped after a bit but it wasn’t fun. And that was even with splitting the pill in half of the lowest dose they prescribe to start with. I had read some reviews prior to taking and found a lot of people recommended splitting it in half or a quarter when first starting, but my body just did not like it.I told my physician and she said it sounded like my blood pressure went too low and we should stop the med and try something else. Other than that, I didn’t have any other bad side effects, but it was clear this medicine just wasn’t for me.",M

He doesn't sleep well or pretty much ever for a long enough period of time. This medication was a nightmare the first night I gave him the prescribed .1mg he fell asleep within 30 minutes and then woke up and was very noticeably dizzy, drunk like walking, head rolling, eyes kinda rolling around, nauseous and crying because he felt weird. He could barely put a sentence together. He was in and out for hours that night he would fall right asleep then wakeup scared of the way he was feeling until well into the morning. The next night his pediatrician reccomended taking 1/2 a pill. The side effects weren't as drastic but it was still bad he woke up maybe 5 times throughout the night again dizzy and having a bad reaction. We called his pediatrician again and she basically said he was having some kind of adverse reaction and to stop meds",DP

Clonidine was recommended for OSA since it decreases REM sleep, the stage in which we OSA sufferers have all our apneas and hypopneas. Unfortunately clonidine was a total disaster for me: not only did it not decrease REM sleep, it jacked up my cortisol so high that I couldn't get back to sleep when I woke up. The side effect of lowered blood pressure is no joke either - mine is normal to low, so this put me very low and had me grabbing onto tables when I tried to stand up from the couch.

Now we are trying Clonidine. With this drug and really all medication you have to be patient to get the full effect. You do see some changes in the beginning but not all as their body gets used to it, it gets more effective. He takes 1/2 in morning and 1/2 before bed total of .1mg of Clonidine Hcl. My son cannot swallow pills so you are able to crush the pill to put in yogurt. In the beginning he fell asleep now he is better with that. It does calm you and helps with aggressive behavior. It does help with sleep but again every night is not perfect but we have more better nights than not. The one thing we notice is when that dose wears off you can see the change behavior wise sometimes the medication burns faster on more active days.

20,Clonidine,Insomnia Stimulant-Associated,10.0,,"April 24, 2020",52,"I was diagnosed with ADHD about a year ago, right before my 21st birthday. My life itself was extremely hard so the reason I went to see a psychiatrist was because I had severe sleeping problems mostly as a result of my PTSD from a sexual assault that happened to me as a child repetitively. Anyways, Clonidine has literally been a MIRACLE WORKER. I used to go days without sleeping, simply because my mind wouldn't turn itself off-- it couldn't... Immediately after I ran out of my first prescription I couldn't sleep. Fortunately for my ADHD and PTSD, Clonidine worked like aspirin to a headache-- it just knew where the pain was and how to make it go away. Now I've been on it for a little over 6 months and I never wanna remember what it used to be like again. I take it about an hour-2 hours before bed because it does take a minute to kick in, and as soon as I feel it I am met with tranquility. Might make you get a full 8-9 hours of sleep though so don't take it if it's only a nap.",heather0816

Did so for months before fully realizing what was up. Did some research and found out that it can negatively impact REM sleep. Extremely scary medication and had a dr wean me off of it immediately.

At this point I am dependent on it to sleep and suffer terrible withdrawal symptoms and brain zaps should I not take it, and the longest I have stayed awake is roughly between 3 to 4 days. I am 22 years old now and have begun the tapering process with hopes to quit taking it all together (this is what was recommended by my doctor.)For what it was prescribed for it worked wonders helping me sleep soundly at night. At this stage I do take a supplemental medication to help me stay asleep (I recently switched from Trazadone to Mirtazapine, natural sleep aids do not work for me personally) as Clonidine primarily helps me fall asleep.

51,Clonidine,Insomnia Stimulant-Associated,8.0,,"December 3, 2015",38,"Clonidine works great for me, but for me it is also really dangerous: it brings down my blood pressure to dangerously low levels, like 65/42 if I am not careful with the dosage. Then I drink quadruple-strong coffee and the blood pressure slowly recovers. I believe that using Clonidine absolutely requires having a blood-pressure meter at home and using it, especially if you wake up in the middle of the night. These pills are soft and so the dosage can be easily adjusted. I am aware of the delayed disturbances in blood pressure if Clonidine dosage is not steady, but for me that is secondary comparing to the potentially deadly pressure drops while asleep. In any case, using a blood pressure monitor is the must.",Jerrycz

53,Clonidine,Insomnia Stimulant-Associated,4.0,,"July 23, 2015",28,"My 3 year old was put on this to treat his insomnia triggered by Autism and ADHD.  Without it he would get up at 9am and be up until 3 or 4am sometimes even as late as 5or 6 and still get up ready to go.  This medication absolutely helps him get to sleep, .01 mg is what he was prescribed however the next day to be honest he was stoned the whole day or most of it, so the doctor had us cut that in half.  Now the problem with that is that he gets his pill promptly at 9pm and at midnight he's back up.  So he gets a second dose to get him to sleep until about 6:30-7ish before he wakes up ready to go.  I'm hoping that we'll be able to solve him getting back up, I think the problem is his pill has to be crushed and so its not a timed release.",moon3goddess3

56,Clonidine,Insomnia Stimulant-Associated,6.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 4, 2015",49,"I began taking clonidine a few years back for hypertension and ADHD. For roughly 2 and a half years it worked well with one 0.1 MG a night. I have had insomnia since I was 6 and I still do at 17. Although this medicine helped to decrease my heart rate, the body will begin to develop immunity towards a medicine after extended use. After 2 and a half years, my dosage had to increase to one 0.2 MG a night. Be careful when increasing dosage, ever since I increased to 0.2 I began to feel extremely anxious, moody, indifferent after sleep, and fatigued. Also I have had awful vivid nightmares almost every night now. Good medicine overall, but extended use could pose problems.",CheyandChris

62,Clonidine,Insomnia Stimulant-Associated,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 29, 2013",61,My 5 year has been on clonodine since he was 2 1/2 to help him go to sleep. He's been diagnosed with Autism and I don't know what I would have done if his doctor wouldn't have put him on clonidine. When he first started on it he was on the 0.1mg but as he grew it wasn't working as well so now he's on the 0.2mg and it works wonderful and he sleeps through the night again. This is the only medication I have let the doctors put him on simply because I'm scared of the side effects of the medicines that the doctor uses to treat Autism.,Bubba's momma

I have been using it for almost a year now and I could not be happier with its results. It helps me fall asleep, but does not make me feel groggy even I need to wake up in the middle of the night. It also helps me to avoid nightmares and other anxiety related symptoms. If you want a sleep aid that does not have the side effects of others like Lunesta or Ambien I would strongly recommend talking to your doctor about clonidine.",Anonymous
