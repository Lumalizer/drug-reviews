0,Gemcitabine,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 6, 2018",8,I had written back in September 2017 about my experience with different chemo and immunotherapy drugs for my non small cell lung cancer.  After not having had positive results the doctor recommended nine cycles of gemcitabine.  I completed the nine chemos in October; in November I had a lung scan which showed the ca was detained and that there was a discrete decrease. I am relieved and happy.
