0,Opdivo,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 7, 2021",4,"My father was diagnosed with stage IV lung and brain cancer back in 2015. He went through chemo and then 2 years of Opdivo. Now, 6 years later, he’s cancer free. How does that even happen? He never complained about any side effects but he also doesn’t share or just doesn’t feel things. I’m sorry for those that had bad experiences with this medication but it seem to be a miracle for others.",E Sprit
1,Opdivo,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 23, 2021",0,"Opdivo is a JOKE ! My husband had a heart attack the day of his second treatment and died the following week because he could not undergo surgery due to being so weak. We were not aware of some of the side effects. After his death I owed more to the cancer center than the hospital due to the fact that this immunotherapy drug cost $16,000 per treatment even though medicare and the supplement helped pay. The ONLY ones who benefit from these drugs are the drug makers. I honestly do not know a single cancer patient that immunotherapy has saved.",His Widow
2,Opdivo,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 13, 2021",7,"My husband, a smoker for 60+years, was diagnosed with nsclc in 2015. After several months of traditional ineffective chemo, his doctor recommended the newly discovered Opdivo. That was late 2015. It is now Feb 2021 and he is still going strong with no/minimal side effects. As I’m sure many fortunate patients can attest, every day is a blessing!",Pat

After 14 months, his MRI showed  an increase in size of his tumors. Six weeks before he died we were on a cruise. Four weeks after this his doctor wanted him to try Opdivo. He was dead within 7 days. Please read all you can about these drugs before making a choice.",Fl Shopper

5,Opdivo,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 11, 2020",13,My husband had been fighting this horrible disease (NSCLC) for two years. At one point the dr. said he was in remission. But the dr. still wanted him to try opdivo. I honestly believe the opdivo was what finished  him. He had been on the opdivo for 3 months when the dr. said sorry but you have 3 months left and we are not going to continue the opdivo. Basically he said go home and die. Unfortunately he died 2 weeks later.,Broken hearted
6,Opdivo,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,10.0,,"July 31, 2019",23,"I had NSCLC. I found out about April of 2018. The hospital I was going to tried radiation and chemo. The cancer had moved to the lymph nodes in my neck. The radiation shrank it some but it came roaring back. My Oncologist started me on Opdivo about October of 2018 and it has been smooth sailing so far. Here it is July 31 2019 and I look forward to maybe only one or two more treatments. My last two PET scans have been good. There is no doubt in my mind that I am alive because of this treatment. I have had some shortness of breath, quite a lot of fatigue, a rash or two, some itching.. Nothing unbearable, just uncomfortable. I am grateful for this technology. Having said that, I quite understand that people who have had negative experiences might even hate it, but how could  I not give myself this chance?",hesees

She has had 6 treatments with Opdivo so far; minimal side effects.  She was on Pemetrexed for 2 years, then in remission for almost 18 months.  Her oncologist wanted to try Opdivo.A 93 year old gentleman who comes to the same cancer clinic biweekly, has been on Opdivo for 2 years now for melanoma.

8,Opdivo,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 7, 2018",24,I started Opdivo in 2010 to 2012 had stage IV lung cancer it is now 2018 and living a normal life.  Thanks for this product it saved my life . In 2010 the life expectancy was only 1 to two years on chemo .,KK
9,Opdivo,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 27, 2018",23,My husband had stage 3B NSCLC with a small metastasis on his spine. Oncologist recommended Opdivo. Only had 2 treatments. After the first treatment he ended up in hospital with severe shortness of breath. He passed away a few days after the second treatment as the drug attacked healthy heart muscle. Don’t try this drug!,Hill
10,Opdivo,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 14, 2018",17,I am sharing my sisters experience with Opdivo. She had stage 3 NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer). She started opdivo after a little over 2 years of chemo. The first year on it went great. All her scans showed no cancer. Then all of a sudden all her blood counts dropped. She was then diagnosed with AML (acute myeloid leukaemia) due to the opdivo.S he lived a month after that. The Doctors said the opdivo gave her a year she wouldn't have had with chemo. There is that but is only a chance to live longer with Opdivo. I don't believe it is a cure now. We are thankful for that one good year.,Sister
11,Opdivo,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 6, 2018",20,"My husband was given opdivo for stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.  Three days after his third treatment, he became seriously ill (short of breath, fatigue, increased oxygen requirements) and was hospitalized.  His oxygen needs increased from a baseline of 5L to 13L upon admission.  Three days later, his oxygen needs increased to 30L and he passed away 10 days after his third treatment.  I believe that Optivo contributed to his death at age 57.  Looking back, he should never have started this medication.",KJ

13,Opdivo,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 29, 2018",19,"My Dad had lung cancer, and it had spread to his liver. His doctor recommended starting Opdivo because chemo was no longer an option. He got his first treatment on July 24, 2017. He began having constipation issues, severe stomach pain, no appetite, with in a week of having the first treatment. Was admitted to the hospital August 5th, and died August 14th. He was suffering and miserable his last few weeks of life. I believe this medication contributed to his death. I think a persons body needs to be in a specific state for it to be successful. By reading the reviews it works wonders on some, and others they die very shortly after starting treatment.",Jessicap85

15,Opdivo,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,,,"December 20, 2017",18,I would not be alive today without Opdivo. A year and a half ago I was diagnosed with lung cancer. I weighed 95 lbs. and I already had radiation and chemotherapy. I had no appetite and was continuing to lose weight. My doctors put me on Opdivo in October 2016. It is now December 2017 and I feel fabulous! My scans have been great and my weight is 145 lbs. I feel better and look better than I have in years. Thank you so much for saving my life.,Zhill
16,Opdivo,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,,,"August 11, 2017",40,"My mom started this treatment after her oncologist  suggested that it was an alternative to other Chemo because is it was not as harsh.  Well after her initial treatment ($27,000) she started swelling, couldn't eat, no energy, confused basically confined to her bed, and then the 2nd treatment, she had developed pneumonia and was hospitalized 4 days later, mom passed after 4 days, numerous antibiotics, blood transfusions and a lot of agony.  I would not recommend this treatment to anyone.  Its awful with life threatening side effects.  I think this is just a money racket to get cash from the dying and the government.",Davidkiser
17,Opdivo,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 2, 2017",30,My mother had ovarian cancer then non small lung cancer. This drug in our family opinion was terrible. We feel it hastened her death and she would have been better off with out it. Terrible side effect - she was covered with some type of horrible rash after the second round. And in hospital . Every time she took it - she would get worse. She got to where she couldn't walk . I think she would have had a better end of life without this. It felt like they were using her for money. : (,Bunnyclover

By the third treatment he so much fluid in his feet and was so weak he couldn't even move himself in bed..they should have never done a third treatment but was more concerned about the price of the treatment, my Dad died a week and a half later, in my opinion he spent the last part of his life miserable because of this medicine.",Terri73

22,Opdivo,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 20, 2017",39,"My husband was diagnosed with NSCLC in late April 2016.  Started on chemo treatments in May 2016. Received 6 rounds of chemo.  His first scan, I believe it was after 2 rounds of chemo, came back ""great news"", cancer had shrunk & some spots disappeared (or were hiding). He continued with chemo and had another scan in November 2016, now there were some new spots.  His oncologist said he could not receive any further chemo treatments and wanted him to start on opdivo.  First infusion of opdivo was November 23, 2016.  By Thansgiving, November 24, he was not feeling well, so Thanksgiving was cancelled.  On December 5, he had severe stomach pain, so he went to ER and was admitted.  He was discharged on December 8.

23,Opdivo,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,7.0,,"January 19, 2017",16,"I have been taking Ondivo since March 2016.  My cancer is now in my liver and the medicine seems to be keeping the  cancer strictly in my liver, due to a PET scan in 12-2016.  I have developed a red rash and found that lotion and creams do help.  Lately I have noticed my nails looking strange and the thumb nails look  like they may come off.  Have not discussed with my doctor, and will do so at the next appointment.  My cancer started in a  knot on my neck and in my lung as stage 4.  I only have the cancer in my liver.  I  am unsure as to what I will do considering that cancer has been contained to my liver only.  I have had cancer since August 2013.",Powder2016

My husbands primary cancer was renal carcinoma which spread to lung after 3 years. He started having a stiff neck with a lot of pain, very low blood pressure, and later developed an intracranial bleed, that was it, over.

I decided to try it to build up my immune system. The first time I had it as I was at the end of the IV I started feeling cold and my blood pressure shot up. The nurses gave me shots to bring it down. The second time I had it, every other week, They gave me some steroids first so I wouldn't have a reaction and I didn't. I did have some achey bones and breakthrough pain. The third time I had it and last time It went fine until I started having 103 degree fevers and my entire body broke out in a red itchy rash. I am on Prednisone IV's and I'm weaning off it right now but the rash is so itchy and nothing takes it away! Too many reactions...",Larrk
