He went through chemo and then 2 years of Opdivo. Now, 6 years later, he’s cancer free. How does that even happen? He never complained about any side effects but he also doesn’t share or just doesn’t feel things.

My husband had a heart attack the day of his second treatment and died the following week because he could not undergo surgery due to being so weak. We were not aware of some of the side effects. After his death I owed more to the cancer center than the hospital due to the fact that this immunotherapy drug cost $16,000 per treatment even though medicare and the supplement helped pay. The ONLY ones who benefit from these drugs are the drug makers. I honestly do not know a single cancer patient that immunotherapy has saved.",His Widow

5,Nivolumab,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 11, 2020",13,Opdivo (nivolumab):My husband had been fighting this horrible disease (NSCLC) for two years. At one point the dr. said he was in remission. But the dr. still wanted him to try opdivo. I honestly believe the opdivo was what finished  him. He had been on the opdivo for 3 months when the dr. said sorry but you have 3 months left and we are not going to continue the opdivo. Basically he said go home and die. Unfortunately he died 2 weeks later.,Broken hearted
6,Nivolumab,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 22, 2019",4,"In April 2017 I was diagnosed with stage IIIB metastatic lung cancer having gone to my lymph nodes. I had chemo and radiation which shrunk the tumor in my lung and destroyed the cancerous lymph nodes. But the next scan showed new nodes involved, so I was started on Opdivo in September 2017. After one year on the drug I showed No Evidence of Disease -cancer free. I have continued to stay cancer free but the side effects have worsened over the last year. Severe fatigue, worsening shortness of breath, nerve spasms, hot sweats, muscle weakness and pain. The side effects now are taking a toll, so I had my last infusion two weeks ago. Now it will take some time to start feeling better. I gave this drug a 9 because it saved my life and was tolerable for two years. I am very grateful. And I do believe I will start feeling better soon.",MJW

She was having trouble speaking as her first adverse effect. Health care practitioners were unable to tell what exactly caused it because this drug is so new. She was given the only thing the books tell them to do in such situations; high doses of steroids. She faded fast and died about a month after her first treatment. This drug is not for everybody, I wish I knew of these reviews before she started treatment. By then it was too late.",JS

The cancer had moved to the lymph nodes in my neck. The radiation shrank it some but it came roaring back. My Oncologist started me on Opdivo about October of 2018 and it has been smooth sailing so far. Here it is July 31 2019 and I look forward to maybe only one or two more treatments. My last two PET scans have been good. There is no doubt in my mind that I am alive because of this treatment. I have had some shortness of breath, quite a lot of fatigue, a rash or two, some itching.. Nothing unbearable, just uncomfortable. I am grateful for this technology. Having said that, I quite understand that people who have had negative experiences might even hate it, but how could  I not give myself this chance?",hesees

After 6 treatments (carboplatin/taxotere) was told that I was stable but disease would come back within 2 years and then I would have 6 months and that would be it.  In May of 2016 (after x number of chemo treatments) I was put on Opdivo and have felt great ever since. I use lots of body lotion after showers to keep the occasional rash in check. This is the only side effect I have to deal with.  Love Opdivo and the carefree life it gives me.,Babette

14,Nivolumab,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 14, 2018",17,Opdivo (nivolumab):I am sharing my sisters experience with Opdivo. She had stage 3 NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer). She started opdivo after a little over 2 years of chemo. The first year on it went great. All her scans showed no cancer. Then all of a sudden all her blood counts dropped. She was then diagnosed with AML (acute myeloid leukaemia) due to the opdivo.S he lived a month after that. The Doctors said the opdivo gave her a year she wouldn't have had with chemo. There is that but is only a chance to live longer with Opdivo. I don't believe it is a cure now. We are thankful for that one good year.,Sister

Three days after his third treatment, he became seriously ill (short of breath, fatigue, increased oxygen requirements) and was hospitalized.  His oxygen needs increased from a baseline of 5L to 13L upon admission.  Three days later, his oxygen needs increased to 30L and he passed away 10 days after his third treatment.  I believe that Optivo contributed to his death at age 57.  Looking back, he should never have started this medication.",KJ

17,Nivolumab,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 21, 2018",5,"My beloved mother is no longer with my family or me. Such an incredible shock this is. In my honest opinion, it wasn't because of the cancer itself, but from the allergic response and adverse effects of this drug, which hastened her death unquestionably (severe motor dysfunction and hydrocephalus.) I wish I did my homework on her new ""treatment"" before it was too late. If I could tell anyone about my story it would be this, do your research on cancer medications (antineoplastics) because sometimes the risks outweigh the potential benefits. Immunotherapy drugs e.g. keytruda, opdivo should be used with EXTREME caution in patients with a previous or a current autoimmune disease and those who show signs of generalized weakness before starting treatment.Thanks for taking my mom sooner than she needed to go Opdivo.",JJ

He began having constipation issues, severe stomach pain, no appetite, with in a week of having the first treatment. Was admitted to the hospital August 5th, and died August 14th. He was suffering and miserable his last few weeks of life. I believe this medication contributed to his death. I think a persons body needs to be in a specific state for it to be successful. By reading the reviews it works wonders on some, and others they die very shortly after starting treatment.",Jessicap85

This drug in our family opinion was terrible. We feel it hastened her death and she would have been better off with out it. Terrible side effect - she was covered with some type of horrible rash after the second round. And in hospital . Every time she took it - she would get worse. She got to where she couldn't walk . I think she would have had a better end of life without this. It felt like they were using her for money. : (,Bunnyclover
