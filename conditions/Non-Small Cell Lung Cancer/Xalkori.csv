0,Xalkori,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 4, 2019",6,"Stage 4 NSCLCI feels awful.  I've been on Xaltori for 4 days. Just starting. I felt great day 1 and 2 then day 3 I saw those shiny lights from both sides of eyes. That night very nauseated. This morning I took the nausea melt pill,  ondansetron..1/2 hour before the Xaltori.  My upper chest feels awful. Almost like there is air trapped in esophagus and I cant keep anything down.  Not sure how long this will last. I'm just plain miserable. I do know the medicine is working..thank you Pfizer Corp Any idea how I can make this work with me instead of against?",Sully

3,Xalkori,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,8.0,,"August 14, 2013",35,"I was on Xalkori for about 6 months in 2012 before it stopped working and I had to go on traditional chemotherapy in September of the same year. I had minimal side effects.  Just a little hair thinning, a little tiredness but no serious problems. Sometimes a little constipation which was easily controlled with a little dose of Milk of Magnesia.  Prior to going on the Xalkori I had lost 19 pounds and had a lot of complications.  While on the medicine I gained the weight back, got my strength back, was able to eat again and was in better shape when I had to go on traditional chemotherapy. In my cases a true blessing.",msfredneck
