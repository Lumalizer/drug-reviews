0,Bevacizumab,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,8,,"October 22, 2008",173,"Avastin (bevacizumab):July 31, 2006 diagnosis: stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer.  I began with a clinical trial of Avastin in January '07.  I continue to have the infusion every three weeks; my cancer is in remission.  Normal life expectancy for this stage cancer is 2 to 5 years.  God has blessed me so far with 2 1/4 yrs of wonderful life and no reason to think it won't continue much longer than 5.  I'm half way there and God has been so good to make the doctors and medication available to me. I recommend it to anyone. Side effects are minimal for me.",jaxmom1953
