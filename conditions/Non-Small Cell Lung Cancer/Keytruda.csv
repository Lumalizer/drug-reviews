1,Keytruda,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 3, 2021",0,My dad started Keytruda in March 2021. He had lung cancer. This was pretty much the only option he was given. He died very suddenly 3 months later. One day he started having horrible abdominal pain. Took him to ER where he was admitted to ICU. He had one kidney completely failed and 3 aneurysms. I feel had he not started Keytruda he would still be with us.,Maddaughter
2,Keytruda,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,3.0,,"October 24, 2021",2,"I took keytruda successfully for 2 years. My oncologist wanted me to keep taking it since I was doing so well, even though the drug shouldn’t be taken for more than 2 years. At almost exactly the 2 year mark, my body filled with fluid. I gain 30 pounds almost instantly and my skin was itchy and painful.  After a sort of brush off from my oncologist that Keytruda was the reason, I saw many doctors until I got to a rheumatologist that figured it all out foe me. I now have Cutaneous scleroderma caused by the keytruda and it is so painful. Now all efforts are to treat the scleroderma and not the cancer.",ColoradoCancerP

6,Keytruda,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 30, 2021",9,I believe my Father died because of Keytruda.  Prior to treatment he was asymptomatic and active.  No cough and never has been on oxygen.  After first treatment he was never the same.  He was gone in less than 3 months and spent his final 2 months of life in the ICU on a ventilator.  Keytruda induced Guillian-Barre was his diagnosis.  Your doctor will minimize the side effects of this drug and no one is being held accountable.

We are all very different genetically & there's no ""One Cure"". My Husb was diagnosed with Stage IV Lung Cancer the Thurs. before Thanksgiving 2019. By Christmas he had radiation for 15 days followed by an evaluation for chemo. After blood work & consultation, he decided on Keytruda, chemo not an option. Had treatment once a week, then every two weeks, once a month and now every six weeks.  As of now he has improved in the sense that the cancer is not growing, yes it shrunk a bit but he will never be cancer free it has compromised his spine, but he's here now and goes to work every day (UPS) and has never had to take the day off due to complications from the treatment (some nausea).  I don't know what tomorrow brings regarding the medication, his cancer or life but I thought 2019 was the last year he would be with us, Today I am grateful for Keytruda.

He has had COPD, recently he got a spot on his lung but otherwise he was strong, though overweight. After his 3rd Keytruda treatment everything went wrong. He lost his voice, kept feeling ""particles"" in his nose and mouth, didn't sleep for over a week,  feet swelled up like footballs, and awful coughing. The doctor said he had a lung infection and sent him home with antibiotics and Lasix. No effect, swelled up even more. He stopped going to the bathroom... both. He could barely walk and we had to lift each leg into our suv, and pull them out one at a time when we got to hospital. Liver & kidneys shutting down, still can not talk, only whisper.. he's dying. He agreed to do this because they said it uses your immune system and my father has a very strong immune system.

12,Keytruda,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 23, 2020",5,My husband had a tiny lung cancer nodule in his lung had 2 weeks of radiation and 3 chemos infusions.  The doctors recommended Keytruda every 3 weeks for a year.  He had one dose on a Friday- by Sunday he could barely breathe and any activity caused is oxygen % to go way down. I had to call 911 and he was hospitalized for a week including the ICU.  Home 4 days and hospitalized again - they tried steriods and more.  We heard the term ground glass  opacities and I first hand saw his x-ray!  We were never told about this 10% side effect of pneumonitis and death.  He died Nov 12 on 18 liters of oxygen.  He suffocated!  We should have been told about this and with the other info on line (breathing problems- having side effects from other meds) he should not have been given it.  Yes- I am very angry- there are too many people dying from the med.  I had to give a 1 but it was not related to effectiveness.,nrs
13,Keytruda,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 23, 2020",2,"My husband had non-small cell stage 4 lung cancer. His doctor recommended infusions of Keytruda because, after testing, he considered my husband to be an excellent candidate for immunotherapy. He had little to no symptoms of lung cancer at the time. The only reason we knew he had it was due to a coincidental CT Scan due to his occasional heart arrhythmia. But after his first infusion, he began much coughing and his incidents of arrhythmia increased to nearly every day from once every 2-8 weeks. He became debilitated from his normal life. After the second infusion, everything worsened and he began having difficulty breathing as the cancer apparently had been launched into high gear by the drug and his lungs were filling with fluid. One and half quarts of fluid were removed from his lungs, but he eventually came down with pneumonia and died 4 days later. I blame Keytruda for taking away precious time we needed together. I would not recommend this drug. It is much too risky!",Nessa

The brain tumor was taken care of with radiation. Started chemo and Keytruda in September, 2018. This drug has worked very well for me. The lung tumor size is now down by 80%, the lymph nodes are clear. My oncologist stopped my Keytruda treatments in December. I had very few side effects, mainly my back itches like crazy at times. My last scan showed the tumor had grown a bit. I have resumed keytruda and expect good results again. For me the drug has worked exceptionally well. I wish it worked this well for everyone.

Nothing helped, the cancer spread and I had mets to brain and bones. Bone mets so bad that my femur spontaneously fractured.

Then doctor said just to be sure it doesn't come back let's put you on KEYTRUDA. She immediately started having fluid on her lungs. They gave her 3 more keytruda infusions until she developed pneumonitis. The doctor let her leave his office with a blood oxygen level of 91. Prescribed prednisone, 60 mg. After 3 days she had to be put on oxygen, which she needed until she died. She went from being totally  independent to totally dependent within 2 weeks. She had so much fluid on her legs that the blisters popped open and her skin deteriorated. She needed bandages on both legs that needed changing everyday sometimes twice a day, She got weaker and weaker. She went from walking by herself to needing a walker and after 2 months a wheelchair and 3 weeks later couldn't even get out of bed. She died 2 weeks later.

Later a brain scan revealed seven brain lesions for which I have been treated Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Before January 27th I experienced arrhythmia fairly regularly anywhere from every two weeks to at least once a month. After my first infusion, my arrhythmia has occurred daily lasting anywhere from 4 to 12 hours which debilitates me often leaving me very weak. (Last week my cardiologist gave me a more powerful  anti-arrhythmia prescription,  but to no effect.) I also experience a persistent dry cough which sometimes makes talking difficult. There is also shortness of breath. And since my second infusion 2 weeks ago occasional neuropathy in my feet. My daily quality of life seems worse than the disease, although the latter's outcome is assured. So I ask myself, two years of feeling like this daily? No way.

27,Keytruda,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,1.0,,"January 31, 2020",54,"Frustrated beyond words.  My husband had his first treatment of Keytruda on a Friday morning at which time his Oxygen levels were normal.  Within a couple of hours he had chills and a fever (to be expected), however I took him to the hospital the next morning because his fever was 101.3 (which I thought was too high).   Upon admission, his Oxygen was 88 and they were alarmed and he's been in ever since. He's now on High Flow Oxygen @ 98.9% and 25 Liters.  They are denying it's the Keytruda and says it wasn't in his body long enough which I don't believe at all.  They keep saying it's a VIRUS.   At one point, his oxygen line broke and he tanked to 39%.  And they didn't put him in ICU (go figure).  They still to this day don't believe it's the Keytruda but we are 100% confident it's the drug.

Dr. kept him on Keytruda. 6 weeks ago, after his Keytruda treatment, my husband got very weak, short of breath and stayed in bed 95% of the time as he was so exhausted from doing nothing. 3 weeks later he had another treatment of Keytruda and the same thing again, weakness, in bed all the time and short of breath. Today he was feeling much better but had to have his Keytruda again today. I will monitor him to see if this treatment kicks him down again. Does anyone have any advise? His Oncologist states that Keytruda is the only thing keeping him alive right now.",Concerned Wife

My father found out he had lung cancer. His brother and father both had also, and passed away at 74 (both same age). My father has been a heavy smoker since age 15, as they were also. After finding out he had tumors on his lungs, we both felt it was a death sentence.  He informed me that he was going to do some treatments with a new drug. I had never heard of, and I work for a pharmaceutical. Keytruda was the name of it. Of course you have to qualify health, stage of cancer and other aspects to be treated. He was a high candidate for this drug as per his doctor. He began treatments immediately upon that confirmation. Within three months one of his two tumors was gone. The other had shrunk 50 %. Here we are in August, the other tumor is gone as per his scans, as well as his blood being normal. Now they did not say he was cured, but his treatments have ceased.",Jer

Her first treatment she became very ill. Ended up in ICU for low sodium. It was bad. She was very ill and was going to stop the treatments. We and the doctor talked her into continuing and honestly she's done amazing with it. The cancer has shrunk. You would never know my mom has cancer. 1.5 yrs later and still doing everything she did years ago. I'm sorry it hasn't worked for everyone but it truly is a miracle drug for some.
