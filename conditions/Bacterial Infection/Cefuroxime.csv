0,Cefuroxime,Bacterial Infection,10,,"June 11, 2021",3,"This drug is awesome. I’ll admit that it sat in my cabinet for a while because I read the reviews and my anxiety skyrocketed. I finally decided to take it and I did not have any side effects whatsoever (except for the bitter taste twice). I would wake at 8am to take a probiotic, eat at 9am then take the antibiotic at 10am. I have to take it twice a day so I did the same routine at 8p, 9p and 10. Eat a nice sized meal and you’ll be fine! Symptoms disappeared by day 3. I took this pill for 10 days. Good luck. Don’t let the reviews scare you!",Sarah112018
1,Cefuroxime,Bacterial Infection,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2020",1,"The Urgent care physician diagnosed me with moderate case of swimmers ear.  He prescribed me the antibiotiic cefuroxime, 500Mg, for a period of 7 days.  After reading other reviews I did use one probiotic pill each day along with probiotic yogurt.  To make a long story short I had no problems with my bowels. However the drug did provide me with a constant moderate headache.  Otherwise than that no other side effects.  Unfortunately, the drug did nothing to resolve my ear infection. So, today, a different physician is going to have me try Ciprofloaxin. I was hoping to avoid Cipro as it is a lot harder on the body with a bigger spectrum of side effects.  Good luck to anyone else who tries cefuroxime.",Martin

4,Cefuroxime,Bacterial Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2020",3,On day 7 of taking cefuroxine  10 day course for bacterial upper respiratory infection.  Taking is  along with Mucus Dm Extended Release and Flonase. Fever stopped immediately on day one but everything else got way worse. Insanely sore throat and unstoppable mucus production make it impossible to drink or eat. It is a nightmare swallowing the pills down. I don't want to finish out but I will per doctors orders but what a waste of precious time and valuable resources.  Oh and the fever's back on day 7.,KellyDC

6,Cefuroxime,Bacterial Infection,4,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 26, 2019",6,Ceftin (cefuroxime):Prescribed this antibiotic Ceftin after a severe reaction to Levaquin for bacterial infection.  Only problem is muscle aches and stomach issues.  I am on day five but I may have to stop before the ten days.  Feels like gallbladder problems but I did not have these symptoms before taking this medication.,minnie

8,Cefuroxime,Bacterial Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 31, 2019",7,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):Daughter is 16mths old and was prescribed this garbage from the ER doc for an ear and chest infection. She was on this for 3 days and had the worst experience ever with stomach pain, vomit, diarrhea galore and would not move from wife's lap/crying. We stopped this med and saw a night and day difference within 16hrs. Unbelievable.",Dave

10,Cefuroxime,Bacterial Infection,4,,"October 1, 2016",6,Just started ceftin for infection of inner ear. Taken twice daily for only 2 full days.some relief from pain but ear is still severely stopped up. Almost no hearing in that ear except my own hheartbeat ..rather annoying but beats the alternative.. Have seen many complaints of bad gastrointestinal problems ..my suggestion is take probiotics while on drug. I have no problem with taking it.. Note take at least an hour apart from antibiotics.  Works well for me.  Hope my ear unstops soon.,k in la
11,Cefuroxime,Bacterial Infection,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 30, 2016",7,"Given for bacterial infection, this medication did nothing but side effects.  Fever, chills, no appetite, weak.  Put this to the infection.  Finished the prescribed amount and noticed red blotches on my skin and peeling.  I think allergic to this product.  Never again.  Still feeling effects.   It's only been one day since completion.",Amaranthus
12,Cefuroxime,Bacterial Infection,6,,"October 11, 2015",7,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):My doctor looked in my ear and nose and saw that they were severe blocked, as well as infected with bacteria. He explained to me that I probably have drainage into the eustachian tube and that has got dirty. So he prescribed me 500mg Ceftin, as well as Allegra-D and Flonase, all to be taken for 15 days. I take Ceftin twice daily morning and night with food. I take Allegra-D and Flonase in the morning before I leave for work. I don't know how the Ceftin works, but I was still plugged up for a good 5 days until it felt like it may be finally kicked in. But is it? It could just be the regular Allegra-D and Flonase? But I guess if this Ceftin is good for many other stuff, it'll be good for all the other bacteria type stuff so I'm happy.",W-U
