0,Levofloxacin,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2022",0,"I was given this drug for diverticulitis at the ER.  After 2 days on this medication, my body started shaking uncontrollably from my neck down.  I couldn't get it to stop, and I couldn't sleep, which lead to severe anxiety/depression.  When I went to my doctor 3 days later for follow up she couldn't believe the dosage they put me on when there was no blockage.  She advised that I stay on it 2 more days, but I just couldn't do it.  To this day (and this was in 2019), I still have nerve issues, tremors and anxiety.   If you look up the ""brand"" name of this drug it's Levaquin which was pulled from the market in 2017.  According to the FDA, doctors should stop treatment with Levaquin, Avelox and similar drugs immediately if patients report experiencing central nervous system side effects, psychiatric adverse reactions, or blood glucose problems.",Shannon
1,Levofloxacin,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 17, 2022",0,"This medication was absolutely horrible for me - it could be fine for others. I took it for diverticulitis and could not sleep for 2 days after only taking one pill but took another dose before I talked to my doc, at this point I had stomach cramping,  severe anxiety and I will never ever take this again. The side effects went on for close to 3 days and then off and on for 5 days. If you have anxiety I highly recommend not taking this or seeing if another med is an option. The worse was the anxiety but I was also confused at times. I also wasn't confident in driving while I had the side effects because it overall just made me feel weird. I will never touch this again!!!",Anonymous

Uncomfortable side effects included anxiety, high blood pressure, muscle and joint pain. My advice is to not use this medication. Weigh the risk. If you can heal you’re infection naturally or with another antibiotic, do so. Only use Levofloxacin if it’s going to save your life.",Rico

This bacteria is not worth getting prescribed this nightmare antibiotic. I did half a pill on the 5th day and stopped, now my heart has not been the same it races by itself. My nerves come and go with burning and the twitching is as bad like when I took this antibiotic. The head nerves feel messed up, and itchy skin is bad. Yes I did read the reviews, but found out h.pylori can be treated natural and can be dropped to a safe rate. Just take probiotics find another route. Even after telling them it had a boxed warning label the nurse laughed and said don’t believe everything you see online. They didn’t even acknowledge it had a boxed warning label. The anxiety was the worse part as h.pylori causes that and then to have this quadruple it. Then for the doctors to say you need anxiety pills for 6 months no way.",DJspike

6,Levofloxacin,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 27, 2021",1,"This medicine was the start of one of the worst journey's in my life.  I went to the ER for abdominal pain (I have never been to the ER before, so this was new for me at age 58) and after tests were run, I was told I had Diverticulitis.  I was prescribed Levofloxacin, generic of Levaquin and a very high dose even though there was no blockage.  The misery started on day 3 of this medication, which was to be taken for 10 days.  My body started shaking uncontrollably from my neck down.  It was like I had Parkinson's and didn't let up, which effected my work/job as I was an Account Executive and on the road every day for work (UPS). When I went to see my GP for follow up after 5 days and she noticed my body movements, she asked how long they had me on it.  When I showed her the bottle she was shocked. She asked me to stop taking it if the shaking didn't stop or lessen after 2 days.  A year later, I was still recovering and ended up with anxiety and depression due to insomnia.
