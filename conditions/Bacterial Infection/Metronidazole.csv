2,Metronidazole,Bacterial Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 18, 2022",0,"I have never written a review! However I would like to start offering my advice as I have gained a lot from others’ experiences. I was prescribed twice a day for 7 days. Each individual will have a different reaction, however for Metronidazole I would say to definitely take this medication with a full meal. Eat some of your meal, take the pill with a full glass of water, then eat the remainder of your meal. I experienced similar side effects as others such as metallic taste, nausea, brain fog, and possibly some issues with balance.However, those side effects have subsided after maybe a week or two after finishing the prescription and the it cleared my bacterial vaginosis. I hope this helps!",Slim

I felt worse taking flagyl than I did with BV. I couldn’t do it anymore after four days of laying in bed feeling like I was dying I finally got myself up and made an appointment with my gp he gave me the vaginal suppositories of clindamycin which seem to be working, no side effects.

I'm allergic to penicillin, so I always get clarithromycin. This time it didn't work. It eased some of the symptoms, but my tonsils looked the same. My doc suspected that it was caused by anaerobic bacteria, so I started taking metronidazole 2x500mg. Short time after the first dose and since then, my nose never felt clearer. However, I had to stop it after the 4th day, because of new symptoms: stomach ache, ear pain, enlarged lymph nodes on the neck and ear, temperature increase and terrible headaches. Because it dries my throat, my sore throat also got worse.I suspect that I have some allergies to the medicine itself, also it was useless to my infection which might've come back after leaving clarithromycin.This medicine is powerful based on my nasal experience, but has unpleasant side effects.",Lidia

It helped me to sip ginger tea when nauseous and to eat a small meal and drink a full glass of water when I take it. As a nurse, I just want to remind people that even if this drug is wrecking your body, always consult your doctor before stopping treatment. If you only take 4/5 days and are prescribed 7, the bacteria left in your body will have time to develop an immunity to meds, and your infection will rebuild and turn into a superinfection and the antibiotics won’t work next time. There is a reason antibiotics are given over prescribed amounts of time, and stopping them before completion is going to bring on something much worse than side effects. Trust me, I wanted to die taking this medication- many sleepless nights and bad side effects- but an antibiotic resistant infection is much worse than one week of side effects.

It sounds dramatic, but I have never felt worse on any antibiotic. What it was prescribed for was so much easier to handle than the side effects of this train wreck.

Longest worst 10 days of my life so I thought.  A month later I was infected with a gastric infection of C diff.  The antibiotics killed all my good bacteria and for that I got infected.  Guess I prescribed again only Flagyl.  Same thing, but the second day I am nauseous, have stomach cramps, head aches and no power whatsoever.  Like having the flu again but worst.

Make sure to AVOID alcohol while taking this antibiotic because it can cause more severe side effects. On my last dosage of this pill I stayed up all night throwing up for 7 hours, every 20 minutes.

You need to put a small amount of liquid in your mouth first, throw the pill back then swallow all at once. Can't even taste it that way. The doctor had me paranoid to take this medicine because they said it would make me sick and violently ill if I drink alcohol with it. I did not want to use a cream so this is way easier for me.
