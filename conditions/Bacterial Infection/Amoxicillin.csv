0,Amoxicillin,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 8, 2022",0,I am really surprised that antibiotics helped me with my back pain. 100% of my back pain went away. No pain killer or other back pain medicines helped. Most of the doctors do not  give prescription of antibiotics for lower back pain. I was given antibiotics for something else but it cured my back pain . I used doxycycline for 10 days then amoxicillin for next 10 days. I asked doctor to give me second dose because I felt it was curing lower back pain. People suffering from lower back pain please try antibiotics hopefully it will fix your back pain problem.,Satwant

I suffer from IBS, GERD, and gastritis so my GI system is very sensitive. Amoxicillin was absolutely horrible. After one dose with food, I was projectile vomiting, had horrible stomach pain, and was throwing up blood. This is one of the worst medications I have ever taken. If you have stomach issues I would take this with caution. I will never take this again.",Anonymous

3,Amoxicillin,Bacterial Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 15, 2021",0,"I was put on amoxicillin yesterday. I have have had what we believe is a virus for a week, but it spread to my chest and a secondary bacterial infection formed. I couldn't breathe easily, especially in my right bronchial area, there was a burning sensation and my heart rate was higher than normal so I couldn't sleep easily. In the past 24 hours I've had 3 pills and the burning sensation is nearly gone. I had an excellent night's sleep. However tonight the inside of my lips began to swell. I have no known allergies and have taken amoxicillin before. Luckily the swelling seems to have stopped without them getting noticeably large, so I'm going to go to sleep and see how it is tomorrow. I'm tempted to try continuing the course for the remaining 4 days because it's really helped, but I know it's said if you get swelling, that's considered a severe reaction and to discontinue. Curious what others would advise having had a similar reaction.",Happy to share

But, not without intense lingering headaches all day long, starting when I first wake up. Tylenol has very little effect on the pain. Laying in a quiet dark room helps a little bit for about an hour, then it's back to throbbing, ringing ears and nausea. It feels like an intense migraine and tension headache combined.

18,Amoxicillin,Bacterial Infection,10.0,,"April 23, 2020",16,"I have been having pain in my back molar off and on for about a week and a half. Right above my crown in my back left top molar. Mostly in the gums. Because of the 2020 pandemic lockdown I was trying to wait it out. While talking to my hygienist friend, she became very concerned and advised me that I could have an abscessed tooth which is a pocket of pus that can form in different parts of a tooth as a result of a bacterial infection. That it sounded like it was in the root of the tooth and the pus was pushing out forming a bump in the gums. The dentist confirmed this. After only one day of the bump showing on my gums and one day usage of the prescription amoxicillin the bump already reduced to non-visible. And the pain has also reduced. I was also warned that if the pain returned, which it may. That we may have to remove the small molar. I am hopeful that this will work as I am already seeing great results and already focusing on rebuilding my immune system following this dose of antibiotics.",CrownedOne

A week passed and my symptoms came back heavy and in full effect and I still hadn't heard anything from insurance or dentist so I went back in.

I used ibuprofen and acetaminophen to decrease the pain and sometimes the pain would go away. I still use ibuprofen and acetaminophen while using the amoxicillin. Now my neck hurts when I talk, so I don't talk unless I have to. Talking increases a headache mostly on the side with the infection but which extends down into my neck and up to the top of the right side of my head.

49,Amoxicillin,Bacterial Infection,6.0,,"March 19, 2017",35,I just wanted to point out that it's important to take as doctor prescribes  The common cold is caused by a virus so that is why your doctor doesn't want to give you antibiotics unless it progresses in to a bacterial infection. You don't want to take antibiotics unless you have to. And you don't want to take them continually for more then 7-10 days or for to short of time. Bacteria becomes immune to antibiotics and can become stronger where your body can't fight them in the future. They are needed in bacterial infections quite often but don't just take any antibiotics for the hell of it or with out a lot of research as they aren't good for you over all.,Lunablue

53,Amoxicillin,Bacterial Infection,3.0,,"June 9, 2016",36,"This drug was really effective in getting rid of my infection but the side effects were difficult to deal with. The tablets made me so exhausted I really struggled to stay awake all day. My eyes would droop at my desk and I felt lightheaded and dizzy. I found it extremely hard to concentrate. I had to leave work early taking this tablet because I could not focus and many times when my colleagues helped drive me home, they had to help me walk to the car because I was so weak and unfocused I couldn't walk in a straight line. I also felt nauseous for most of the day and had mild stomach cramps. It was wonderful for the infection I had but was the hardest week coping with the exhaustion and drowsiness.",Nicolahbn
