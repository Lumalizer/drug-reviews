After 8 wks I decided antibiotics might be the solution. I had taken antibiotics for an ingrown hair once before about 20 years ago. I had no known allergies and I’ve been on a lot of meds over the years for rosacea and cystic acne breakouts including Accutane, Doxycycline, steroids etc. A friend of mine had Bactrim and I decided to try ONE pilI - certain it would be fine. I was wrong. Within 30 minutes I broke out in hives. I had 3 on my face, several on my arms and legs. The hives stopped after the initial breakout and although I was worried, I was keen to just keep watch and not go the ER. They finally went down about 24 hours later. I spent the night being very anxious / paranoid and feeling really off in general. I took two doses of Benedryl and it’s now been 36 hours and I feel fine but it was scary.

It still remains to be see whether it helped my prostatitis; I was given 28-day course of 56 pills at a combined 960mg tablet. But while using it, I had many profound negative side effects: extreme anxiety, racing thoughts, and pounding heart that did not respond to various self-soothing techniques such as mediation, breathing, or even a cold shower; insomnia to the point I didn’t sleep but a few minutes a night for my last three days on the drug; various flu-like symptoms such as mild fever, fatigue, chills and hot flashes, weakness, and cognitive ability loss; and an out-of-body feeling. I stopped taking it after eight pills when I noticed the symptoms always ramped up 15-30 minutes after taking a dose. Before that I didn’t connect these insane symptoms to my new medication, but I probably should have because I had a similar reaction to another antibiotic, levofloxacin, a couple of years ago.

I also suffered from an  off-and-on headache throughout the week. I am not normally prone to any of these issues. I also slept very poorly (also not my norm) while taking this medicine and by Day 5 I woke up feeling exhausted and just generally unwell.

Bactrim alleviated my joint and epididymitis pains amongst other things including clearing my skin. Unfortunately at the 6th day of treatment I began to get itchy and called my doctor who informed me I must be allergic to it. I'm sad, since it worked and while it was working I felt fantastic and healthy. It took some time to work (about 5 days). Aside from the itchiness, I didn't experience any additional side effects. I was even sleeping better, but that was most likely due to it getting rid of the bacteria causing my systemic infection. Give it a go if you receive a script for it! Currently on the quest for finding an alternative that works just as well, if not better. Bear in mind when reading reviews about any antibiotic that the negative effects of it could be due to an allergic reaction, and that just because someone else is allergic to it (and had a bad anaphylactic reaction at that) does not mean you are!",a student
