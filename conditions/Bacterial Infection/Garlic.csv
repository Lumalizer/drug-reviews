0,Garlic,Bacterial Infection,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2014",37,"Had nasty nose infection after having a cold and fever last year. I had to wait 14 days before it cleared the rash at tip of my nose which left a scar.  Today I got it again and fresh garlic stopped from spreading immediately.  No more creams for me.  I'm truly amazed.  It seemed to stop spread fast, stop itch. Just plain fresh garlic applied to affected area.",Lasoric
