0,Ciprofloxacin,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 24, 2021",3,"My sister was given it as part of a Lyme disease treatment.  When a Lyme patient takes an antibiotic it causes something called a Herxheimer reaction as it fights the disease. My sister took Cipro (500mg x2 or x3 per day) she immediately felt horrible. She had dreadful muscle pain, couldn't raise her right arm and was really sick however she had never read about being floxxed, the name given for the horrible side effects of floroquinolines She assumed it was the famous ""herxing"" , so she continued taking it for 30 days.  When she had her regular phone appt after a month w/ her Dr, he immediately said It's not a herx, you've been floxxed. This was 10 years ago and she's still in pain and can't lift her arm.  One of the strangest and most difficult side effect was she started to have audio hallucinations. She constantly hears radio, church bells, vacuuming, gongs etc all the time. She doesn't hear ppl talking, not schizophrenic. Does anyone else get this?? Pls msg me if you do!!",Julia B

It was 7 months of hell, but when there isn't another anti-biotic that can kill the infection and you're on the last of 3, you take it.  One comment here that said it should be taken off the market, well if it had I'd be dead. It was horrendous but I'M ALIVE. Thank you to the guys that find these drugs, side-effects or no side-effects, without them I wouldn't be here. If you put it into perspective 7 months is nothing.

I looked up the side effects after the 8th pill (evening day 4) and every single bizarre symptom I was having including the panic attacks and psychiatric systems, neuropathy, major abdominal pain and worsened diarrhea were there . Terrified, I decided to stop the medication immediately. I had no idea that I had just been poisoned by a Fluoroquinolone. 2 months later I had a CT scan that said NO Diverticulitis.

I nearly went blind permanently.  Severe Anxiety.  Severe food allergies.  Can't eat gluten anymore.  Nearly destroyed my marriage.  Could no longer play with my kids.  I am now picking up the pieces of the damage this drug has done to my life 7 years later.  My advice is never take CIPRO or LEVOQUIN or any drug in this family if antibiotics.  There are 7 families of antibiotics they can give you another kind.  Don't let them talk you into this garbage by telling you that this can't happen to you.  It can and does very often happen.  Read all of the other reviews.  They are true.  There are many support groups that you can talk to also for victims if this poison.  You have been warned.,Scott
