0,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 15, 2022",0,"I was prescribed 5 days of Bactrim DS for a small cyst that has popped. It’s like using a nuclear bomb to level a shed. I’ve had nausea, lightheadedness, ringing in my ears and diarrhea. General unease where you know you feel like crap but you can’t wholly articulate it. I made sure to eat and drink water before dosing, but it barely helped. I need to take two more pills but I don’t know if my body can take it.",JustSick
1,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 20, 2021",0,"I was prescribed this medication for a post op infection. Within 12 hours of starting the medication I developed a fever and rash. I continued taking the medication for 4 more days as I did not realize it was an allergic reaction. Within the next 4 days I developed a severe headache, vomiting, my fingers went numb, severe eye redness, severe weakness to the point I had trouble walking and decreased urination. My Doctor immediately took me off the medication and had blood work done. My liver enzymes were sky high The symptoms stopped as soon as the medication was discontinued but It took about 6 months to get feeling back in my fingers.",Jennifer

3,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2021",0,"Sulpha drug allergyMy 12 y old son was given this Bactrim d.s by a doctor as he started  having watery stool with vomiting sensation. After 5-10 minutes of taking the tablet, serious skin allergy appeared all over his body, and he vomited a lot. Then he was taken immediately to a nearby hospital and given Avil injection. Then the rashes  began to subside slowly and became normal after about 2 hr. Luckily, he swallowed the tablet whole and then vomited it out. Had he it chewed up and swallowed, the allergy would have been much worse.  It was a terrible experience. Please make sure you are not allegic to sulpha drugs before taking this medicine!",Singson
4,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 10, 2021",1,"I started Bactrim DS 3 days ago for an infection in my jaw. Everything seemed to be ok but I began feeling extremely weak and achy. By the second dose on day 3 I began running a fever  of 101.7. I thought maybe it was the infection. My glands in my neck were swelling and my eyes were burning. My head felt like my brain was literally swelling. I read all of these could be a potentially serious side affect of Bactrim, so I didn't take the second dose like I was supposed to.  After a couple of hours my fever started to break without me taking anything for it. My head started feeling better. I began to drink even more water than before to flush it out and the dangerous side effects began to go away. I know it was the Bactrim because had it been the infection, the fever wouldn't have gone down on its own without medication.",E.N.
5,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2021",7,"I had taken the bactrim 800/160 twice in a day as told. When I got it after my appointment and before bed. That night I was up until 6am throwing up the medicine. I felt nauseous, confused, and my stomach hurt bad. I had food in my stomach so I’m unsure why it acted this way but I would never take again.",Destiny
6,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 11, 2020",9,"I'll be honest I was not expecting much from Bactrim but it definitely helped me. Bactrim alleviated my joint and epididymitis pains amongst other things including clearing my skin. Unfortunately at the 6th day of treatment I began to get itchy and called my doctor who informed me I must be allergic to it. I'm sad, since it worked and while it was working I felt fantastic and healthy. It took some time to work (about 5 days). Aside from the itchiness, I didn't experience any additional side effects. I was even sleeping better, but that was most likely due to it getting rid of the bacteria causing my systemic infection. Give it a go if you receive a script for it! Currently on the quest for finding an alternative that works just as well, if not better. Bear in mind when reading reviews about any antibiotic that the negative effects of it could be due to an allergic reaction, and that just because someone else is allergic to it (and had a bad anaphylactic reaction at that) does not mean you are!",a student
7,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 17, 2020",13,"Developed an abscess , doctor prescribed bactrim for infection along with opening and draining abscess.  With in one hour of taking my first dose, I had this happen: throat started feeling tight , lips started swelling . With in hours throat became worse, fever developed and lips were covered with blisters . Later in the evening my eyes were burning like someone had dumped chemicals in them . I developed small ulcers on corneas. Vaginal soreness followed. I had a severe reaction to bactrim after one dose. It has now been 24hours and my condition has improved slightly . PLEASE think twice before taking this medication . Doctor says I’m very lucky to have not ended up in hospital.",Doll21601
8,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,4.0,,"February 24, 2020",30,"I read the reviews but I really wished I would’ve listened. It seems like it’s helping cure my staph infection but the side effects aren’t worth it. Maybe the medication was too strong of a dose but I had to take 800mg/160mg 2x a day for 10 days. I’m writing my review as I’m taking this medication, it’s making my heart race, it’s making me dizzy and lightheaded, jittery, messing with my stomach, confused, headaches are off the wall. I’m drinking plenty of water and eating plenty of food. I’m also breastfeeding and it seems like it’s making my son sick, he was fine until I started taking it and now he’s vomiting, very fussy, low fevers and sleeping on and off all day. We’re not around people too much so it’s highly unlikely he got sick from somewhere else. I stopped taking it after the third day. I had to call an ambulance because I was home alone with my baby and I felt so off and my heart was racing all day.",Daishaaaaa
9,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 30, 2020",22,"Started on this sulfate antibiotic  Bactrim 2 days ago for an infected sebaceous cyst.  Several hours after taking first pill I developed a 102°, fever, splitting headache, muscle aches....I thought I was coming down with the flu.  The second day the same thing happened....fever, muscle aches, severe headache again..  Took some Tylenol and crawled into bed for the entire afternoon.  I’m not going to take tonight’s pill, and call doctor in the morning for a different antibiotic.  I’ve never had reactions like this to any antibiotics I have taken in the past.",Scooter
10,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 3, 2020",12,"Was on the Bactrim antibiotic for 1 week to clear up epididymitis. It took around 4-5 days to notice any difference and I didn't really experience any sort of side effects other than anxiety which is something I already struggle with anyways but it seemed to amplify it and at times I felt confused and kind of dizzy. Make sure to drink lots of water and also I would recommend taking with food to avoid any stomach problems. Overall, the pain from epididymitis is gone and that is all I care about, I think the side effects are worth it and remember they are only temporary",jamestheman
11,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 18, 2019",8,"For 6 months, I had a sore throat. It felt like a lump in my throat. I went to 5 different doctors because, well, I'm in North Dakota. Sore throat for 6 months. Blood test normal. Negative for mono. Laproscopy negative for other diseases. Red swollen tonsils.  I was finally given Bactrim DS by a dr who flew in from another state to see me and other patients.  An ENT specialist, she prescribed this wonderful medication. I had strep and pus stuck in my throat from 2 head colds back to back months earlier. My side effects from Bactrim DS- yellow diarrhea for the duration of medicine. Not bad though. Extreme drowsiness an hour after taking it which was unexpected for just an antibiotic. Did not drink alcohol with it either. Took one pill twice a day. Shaky from blood sugar drop on first day but ate full meals and was ok. Felt better after 4 days. No sore throat since. Took whole bottle to kill all the germs. Love this medicine!",Joanne
12,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2019",27,Worst medication ever. My anxiety is through the roof. I am freezing most of the time when I’m not drenched i sweat. Heart rate is racing.  Can’t sleep due to the horrible feeling of not waking. It’s like the spins but different. I swear I was seeing the light! I would be listening to my husband tell me to drink the water next to me but I couldn’t respond or move. It was like I was paralyzed. Very terrifying. If at all costs please find an alternative antibiotic. I wouldn’t wish this on my worse enemy....pure torture. I am prescribed it for 14 days twice daily and I’m only on day 3.,Bj

Vagina burning, that started on the second day.I HAVE had Bactrim before for UTI's but have NEVER experienced what I am with this darn one.

14,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 12, 2019",9,"I am currently taking this medicine to help me fight a serious bacterial infection. Every time I take it during the day, nasty side effects occur...the feeling of throwing up, very bad stomachaches, feeling like I have diarrhea. However, I have been defecating fine but still feel like I have diarrhea due to the extremely bad stomach ache I am currently having. My throat is getting better and I sound less congested. I think that's one of the many benefits that it has. I am hoping to be on a different drug that will help me get better faster and never have this very strong drug negatively affect my stomach anymore!",Meag
15,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 31, 2019",20,Bactrim has been the worst experience of my life. First I was on the IV for pcp pneumonia which is cleared up with not many side effects but once I went on the oral bactrim that all changed. My tongue is swollen and sore constantly. I have a hard time eating and my stomach is torn up from it all the time. I have a hard time sleeping because of the crazy dreams and it keeps me awake. And now I have developed a painful sore throat and swollen glands to the point I have trouble speaking. Eating has become awful! I hate this drug and my doctor continues to prescribe it to me.,Rod
16,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,8.0,,"July 29, 2019",19,"This is my 2nd time on Bactrim. I contracted MRSA after my c-section and although it does the job it’s prescribed to do I have never felt so lethargic, nauseous and just extremely sleepy. The nausea comes in waves all day long and I can hardly stay awake. I couldn’t figure out what was going on with me until I thought I bet it’s my antibiotic! Bactrim does the healing of staph infections but it reeks havoc on your body as well.",Lilly
17,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 28, 2019",18,"Prescribed Bactrim for sore throat after taking Amoxicillin for 4 days (culture test indicated that Amoxicillin would not work for the bacteria found). At first, side effects included drowsiness, weakness, confusion, overall sluggishness, severe anxiety, rapid heart rate, and insomnia. I am on day 5 of 7, and have regained strength and have less confusion/drowsiness; however, the anxiety, increased heart rate, and insomnia are still present. I have woken up twice in the middle of the night with rapid heart rate, anxiety, sweats, and inability to fall back asleep.  Hopefully this will cease to be a problem once I complete the course. This antibiotic is definitely not for me, and will opt for an alternative should I ever need it again. I gave it a 3 (instead of 1) because I believe it has helped with the infection; however, side effects are awful for me.",Jake

I did take it and then get into my pool, so I thought it was from the chlorine. I got out showered and after a few hours the burning subsided. I took another pill and once again the burning started intensely. I went to bed slept through the night woke up and still have the symptom plus itchy eyes, face, and arms. I took benadryl and I am praying for relief. When I spoke to my mother about these symptoms, she said she had the exact same reaction. Beware!",t
