After 8 wks I decided antibiotics might be the solution. I had taken antibiotics for an ingrown hair once before about 20 years ago. I had no known allergies and I’ve been on a lot of meds over the years for rosacea and cystic acne breakouts including Accutane, Doxycycline, steroids etc. A friend of mine had Bactrim and I decided to try ONE pilI - certain it would be fine. I was wrong. Within 30 minutes I broke out in hives. I had 3 on my face, several on my arms and legs. The hives stopped after the initial breakout and although I was worried, I was keen to just keep watch and not go the ER. They finally went down about 24 hours later. I spent the night being very anxious / paranoid and feeling really off in general. I took two doses of Benedryl and it’s now been 36 hours and I feel fine but it was scary.
