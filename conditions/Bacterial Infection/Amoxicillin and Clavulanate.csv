0,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Bacterial Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 20, 2022",0,"I was given Amox-Clav 875-125MG for a dog bite. The very next day after intercourse I had swelling in the labia and was extremely sore and sensitive. Unlike normal swelling from intercourse these symptoms lasted a week and was followed by white discharge that I had to keep cleaning out of my creases. There was also dead skin shedding on the toilet paper after wiping. Also a frequency to urinate. At this point I had not read about possible side effects of taking this medication. After 10 days and taking the entire script I went back to see the doctor to have the staples removed from the bite and doc prescribed me another week. In this week I start experiencing new symptoms. It started hurting on the upper part of my injured leg really bad but not at the bite location and my legs were swelling. My head started to hurt and didn't stop for three days straight and mouth was extremely dry all the time and couldn't taste. Still have vagina itching, swelling, soreness and frequency to urinate.",Anonymous

Day 9 severe dizziness started, rapid heart beat but ER doctor thinks it not from medicine. Day 10 itchy legs and arms now as well and severe nausea. I am so glad medicine done, I should have called regular doctor back, but by time they would get back to me doses would pretty much be done.  Will never take medicine again!! Day after still nausea, next day better and no more itchy hands or feet, but then next day nausea again for like 5 hours, and itchy feet and hands again later in evening again.

Loss of appetite too i've noticed. I think it's increased my anxiety too but i'm a bit of a hypochondriac to begin with so idk my anxiety might be increased just because this drug is whacky.

It may be coincidence, but after taking tablet 21, I awoke with the most severe nausea I have experienced in 7 decades of life.  I then vomited 5 times, so severely, I think I may have internal injuries - that will have to be investigated.  I'm uncertain if it did not effect my circulatory system. That was four days ago.  I took no more of the Rx.  I feel completely disabled.  (I have not vomited for any reason until this, for 10 years).  It could be a coincidence, but I wouldn't take this again.

I couldn't believe my prescription was over $30 for a generic version, but figured this had to be good stuff.  Two days later no improvement, but explosive watery diarrhea every couple of hours despite probiotics.  Having been a caregiver, I recognized a C. diff infection.  Sure enough, Googling confirmed that Augmentin is notorious for inducing this!  I knew this wouldn't be tolerable for the remainder of the course of treatment, plus it can lead to colitis, so I begged to be switched to a ""plain"" antibiotic.

Had I listened to these negative comments, I might've never known the wonders this has worked on me. Long story short.. I've battled a horrible infection in my gums/jaw for a longtime. I was on penicillin, amoxicillin, clindamycin, etc! NOTHING helped at all. Finally landed myself in the ER, and was given augmentin. I was skeptical as nothing else had worked on this infection. Needless to say, I took as prescribed. Ate a meal at the start of ever dose, had yogurt after every dose as well. And it worked amazing for me!! Day 2 infection was finally gone! No harsh side effects, no stomach upsets etc. I truly believe if you've taken this with food and yogurt as you're suppose to, you'll be just fine.",Blah
