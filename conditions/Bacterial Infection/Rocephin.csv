1,Rocephin,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 14, 2022",0,"I received Rocephin for treatment of thyroiditis through i/v in a diluent 2 years back. Just after 3 to 4 min of i/v infusion, my body started getting warmth and severe itching on whole body along with sweating. The medication was immediately stopped however the feeling continued for next 10 to 15 min. I was giving antidote immediately to reduce the symptoms and was shifted to ICU for vitals observation. It was the worst experience of my life with any antibiotics. It didn't work for me. But everyone must also be careful if they are getting it for the first time.",Mrs Haider
2,Rocephin,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 29, 2021",0,"Suffer with lower back pain so I did not notice the kidney infection forming. Went to the ER as Pain was increasing and moving to the flank right side. Turns out it was an acute right sided kidney infection with stone blockage as well as bladder involvement. This antibiotic was a serious life saver as the pain was becoming intolerable. With in 24 hours a marked improvement. For anyone with a reaction , it is related to penicillin and if you have a reaction to penicillin it’s not a medication you should have. Not a drug company issue but an individual issue. Each medication can affect each individual differently, no way to foresee an issue from the drug company but the treating physician should have warned if you have a penicillin reaction then this too will affect you. I was asked by the physician and went over allergies prior to injection. Fully informed on each medication I ever take.  Highly recommend, the injection does have a real burn to it, worth the end result! Best of luck to all.",Nsm320
3,Rocephin,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 19, 2021",1,I 100% recommend this drug for anyone with an intense infection. I am currently on Flagyl due to a C. Diff infection and my doctor advised me not to take any antibiotics orally. Was diagnosed with a double ear infection and a chest infection after going in to urgent care for symptoms unrelated to C. Diff. Let them know everything and my care plan now involves using this injection to clear up my ear and chest infections through my muscles instead of digestive tract since I am still taking Flagyl. The injction stung a tad when injected but I hardly felt anything other than that due to my fear of rupture in my ear drum. Honestly I couldn't say how big the needle was because I was too focused on what was being said about the possible rupture. I have 2 more injections to do over the next two days and I am looking forward to them. This is a miracle. I already feel less pressure in my ears and its only been 6 hours. I expect this to be gone very soon! So pleased. No side effects to me at all.,Mercedesk1277
4,Rocephin,Bacterial Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 29, 2020",24,"I had my first sinus infection this year. I suffered from continuous low grade fevers, headaches, sore throat, ears and sinuses aching and lymph nodes all swollen for weeks. Finally went to urgent care. I was given Augmentin for 10 days with absolutely no improvement. I went back and was given a shot of rocephin and tordal. Within 2 days, almost 100% back to normal. Also started 7 days of Levaquin. Unfortunately infection came back within 2 weeks. I got another shot Rocephin today and within hours have started feeling better. It only burns a little. I did not have any side effects either time. Completely worth it!!!",Mandy

6,Rocephin,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 31, 2019",7,I’ve had this injection twice once when I was pregnant for a ear infection/flu and once today for sinus infection and it works so well!!!! Clears up a sinus infection within hours. This shot is HUGE and it hurts but if your nurse gives injects it into you slowly it won’t be too bad. I am terrified of these shots but I begged for it today and was glad I got it.,Hg6261616
7,Rocephin,Bacterial Infection,9.0,,"December 11, 2019",7,"Concerning painful injection of Rocephin: just ask the nurse to give it very, very slowly. This makes all the difference. If given very fast, you can’t hardly  walk out of the office. Slowly, no problem, of course, it will burn a little going in, but not badly.",Jan

10,Rocephin,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 6, 2019",13,"Since I've started taking vitamins, (prenatal, vit c & echinacea), I don't get sick as much as I use to. Monday it started with a sore throat. The next day still sore throat, congestion buildup. The next day, it was all a little worse. In the mean time, I was taking mucinex (with no relief). The next day, I felt like I was on my deathbed. I had a headache that started at lunch Wednesday, it was full force the next morning. I had dizzy spells throughout the day. Started dayquil and ibuprofen on top of that. No relief whatsoever. I was coughing up yellow gunk. Blowing out yellow gunk. Went to the dr. Begged for any shot. He gave me this last night. Huuuge difference. My headache is gone...congestion is at ease. I feel like a whole different person. He also gave me 2 other antibiotics. I will take that shot again if I need to.",Anonymous
11,Rocephin,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 29, 2019",38,I had suffered from bacterial vaginosis for 3 + years. I constantly was treated with metronidazole (pills & gel) and it would immediately creep on back within days of finishing my medicine. Finally when I went to the ER with terrible pains in my abdomen I was told I had PID. They treated me with a shot of rocephin and I haven’t had BV in over a year. It’s a miracle. Doctors should be treating patients with this instead of flagyl/metronidazole. That doesn’t work! This shot kills it once and for all.,Chronicbv

Doctors kept telling me ""oh it's just a virus and will pass"".  It always came back.  Finally my doctor tried a shot of Rocephin  and it started to work within a couple HOURS.  I still felt sick the next day and had to miss work and wound up in ER the following evening due to extreme migraine  headache, high BP, nausea but I think it was from the doxycycline that was also given to me to take orally.

Once the pain got bad enough that the pyridium was no longer effective, I called the doctor and begged for help while still waiting for the second culture results. They gave me a shot of Rocephin.
