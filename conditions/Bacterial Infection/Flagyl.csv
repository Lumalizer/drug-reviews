I’m taking this following the removal of my Mirena IUD..  I’ve never felt worse in my life - my joints hurt, hard time falling asleep and when I do fall asleep, I’m having crazy nightmares. My back hurts so bad that I thought I slipped a disc. It also tastes down right disgusting. Never again.",Liz
1,Flagyl,Bacterial Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2022",0,"I was given this medicine (500 mg flagyl) from an urgent care doctor for bacterial vaginosis. I had thought it to be just another antibiotic and didn’t bother looking anything up about it, the first day I could taste that horrible taste and had a headache, the second day I was in my bed crying whole body ache, headache, nausea, diarrhea and that horrible taste which made the nausea worse and there’s nothing you can eat or drink that helps it. I felt worse taking flagyl than I did with BV. I couldn’t do it anymore after four days of laying in bed feeling like I was dying I finally got myself up and made an appointment with my gp he gave me the vaginal suppositories of clindamycin which seem to be working, no side effects. I get chronic bacterial infections and have had many different types of antibiotics but flagyl is something else. Just say no to this one and save yourself a week of laying in bed feeling like death, you’re welcome.",Nope

I have been taking Flagyl for a few days now after undergoing surgery and am now realizing it seems this medication is making it extremely hard to fall asleep as well as stay asleep.

6,Flagyl,Bacterial Infection,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 20, 2021",0,"The side effects for me haven't been good, but I'd rather finish the medication than to have my infection come back and be resistant to the antibiotics. I have darkened urine, cramping in my lower abdomen, headache, hurting reddish eyes, tiredness, fluctuating levels of concentration, sadness. I have 3 days left of the pills and it's 3 am now. I woke up from my sleep due to heavy pain in my legs and body, and overheating (though I don't feel feverish). 2 days ago I went on a walk after not doing so for weeks, but I don't think that caused it. I've been sore from walking before and this is a higher level of pain than that. I didn't even walk for that long, and the jobs I've had require standing and walking around all day. So it's weird. My legs hurt so bad. But it is clearing up my infection so I'll finish the regimen so I can be fully well and back to normal.",Some chick

I thought I would end up in the psych ward, I had hallucinations, mania, couldn’t remember what I was saying.  Went to ER and they quickly figured out it was from the med.  They said it’s rare to have the psychotic effects.  The ER doc said I should never take that med again.  It’s been great in the past and I know it’s the strongest way to get rid of BV.

10,Flagyl,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 30, 2021",1,I have had horrible urination pain and irritation. It took me a while to figure what was wrong with me. BV didn’t cross my mind. I started taking Flagyl two days ago and the irritation is gone and urination is slowly getting better. I have some pain in my lower abdomen but that is the only side effect that I have experienced. I did have some trouble sleeping but I asked about equate and that was okay to take with it and it helped me sleep and cleared up allergies I have from the weather change. After a long month of wondering what would fix me this is the only thing that helped. I do recommend it if BV is taking over.,Robyn

12,Flagyl,Bacterial Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 12, 2021",0,"Had an abscessed tooth, decided to take flagyl. Didn't even know I was experiencing the symptoms everyone Is complaining about till I read these comments. My Urine is definitely very dark compared to normal, the taste I thought was infection draining in my mouth, it was the only thing that would make since as to why I have a pretty rotten taste in my mouth, anxious and I  feel a little distant. My stomach is feeling a bit nauseous, and I kinda feel generally out of it. With that said the excruciating pain diminished over the 3 days and that one thing was worth 50 fold of the side effects. If you sit around self analyzing how you feel, your probably going to notice every bell and whistle, but if you just go about your day like any other, you might find you didn't even know you was experiencing side effects until you read horror stories online.

15,Flagyl,Bacterial Infection,1.0,,"October 30, 2021",1,"The worst nightmare of my life after taking Flagyl. My appendix had ruptured, after surgery they gave me Flagyl intravenously and my nightmares began. Fever, chills, nausea/vomiting, high blood pressure, explosive diarrhea every thirty minutes, my stomach was so extended and tight it looked like I was 9 months pregnant, anxiety, tingling in hands. After four days of absolute terror, in the hospital and no one would believe me, I demanded to be taken off of Flagyl. They had me on blood pressure medicine, anti anxiety meds, anti nausea, pain relievers and did an ex-ray, showed it to me my bowels were swollen to the size of baseballs in some places, they were going to operate on me again and I said NO. As soon as I told them to take me off of the Flagyl in 12 hours my stomach started to reduce in size, my diarrhea was only every four hours instead of every 30 min. my heart rate went down, and was able to leave the hospital the next day.

When I was actively taking it, I was so physically ill and couldn't eat. After the medication, my appetite never came back and I ended up with possibly permanent digestive issues that I am still under medical care to treat. I had to stop working out, lost weight and body mass, and just wish I could go back in time and never take this medication again.

Only side effect of this medication was a little loss of appetite after day 4. Previously I had taken 2 round of z pack from my obgyn, 2 rounds of flucanazole from my obgyn, steroid cream from the dermatologist, another 2 rounds of flucanazole from the dermatologist. I went to the dermatologist because everything was inflamed! I am so annoyed that I had to go online to  to find this solution of Flagyl after suffering for almost a whole 10 months. My OBGYN never even told me about this, I did my own research. After the failed visits to the doctors I tried boric acid, baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, tea tree oil, castor oil, etc…the one day I looked in to  and I was able to get this medication easily and fast.

DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL. I am no stranger to a few beers a day, glass of red wine, etc. I didn’t think that a beer would make me so sick. This drug prevents the body from breaking down alcohol properly in the body and you WILL pay for it. It is a fast hitting sickness you will never forget. Take the meds, it will pay off in the end to cure your infection 100%. The side effects are real and they are rough….

I went in for my regular pap smears and walked out of the office with prescriptions for Flagyl. Mind you in both cases I had no symptoms of a vaginal bacterial infection. The first time I took the medication I had horrible side effects, upset stomach, feeling of illness, fatigue, metallic taste in my mouth. After finishing the meds I ended up with a yeast infection because the meds got rid of all the good vaginal bacteria. I was recently prescribed another round of Flagyl after a routine pap smear three years later with a different doctor and again I've had no symptoms of a vaginal infection.

I also had dryness in my mouth (not sure there was any metallic taste though). Yesterday was the end of my 7th day and my doctor thankfully said that I can stop taking it. I was so relieved until I figured out even though I did not take any flagly on my first day I had a blurry-like vision following that extreme tingling on my teeth, hands and feet.

Eating BRATs foods (will help the diarrhea or upset stomach) and drinking lots, LOTS, of water is necessary. Also getting lots of probiotics and electrolytes have helped me feel better. I’ve noticed that it makes the effect of caffeine and weed almost 10x stronger, and not in a good way. So be careful and watch your heart beat / blood pressure.

On flagyl, I experienced fatigue -- when I tried to workout to boost energy, I felt horrendous -- nauseous with flu-like symptoms. I experienced loss of appetite for normal healthy foods and found that I was binging on unhealthy foods. Slight metallic taste in my mouth, and a moderate feeling of upset stomach that came and went. Also, moderate bloating. If I had been extremely sick, and Flagyl made me feel better, I may have kept on it, but for someone with mild SIBO, this drug wasn't worth it.

It helped me to sip ginger tea when nauseous and to eat a small meal and drink a full glass of water when I take it. As a nurse, I just want to remind people that even if this drug is wrecking your body, always consult your doctor before stopping treatment. If you only take 4/5 days and are prescribed 7, the bacteria left in your body will have time to develop an immunity to meds, and your infection will rebuild and turn into a superinfection and the antibiotics won’t work next time. There is a reason antibiotics are given over prescribed amounts of time, and stopping them before completion is going to bring on something much worse than side effects. Trust me, I wanted to die taking this medication- many sleepless nights and bad side effects- but an antibiotic resistant infection is much worse than one week of side effects.

It should be in your mouth for less than a second, just swallow it down with a glass of water or some orange juice.",ashleyelizabeth8
203,Flagyl,Bacterial Infection,10.0,,"April 2, 2013",37,"Started taking Flagyl for bacterial vaginitis on Friday. Didn't start feeling side effects until late Saturday, where I experienced flu like symptoms. It is now Tuesday, and I can't wait until my last dose. I am taking 500mg every 12 hours for 7 days. I also have interstitial cystitis, which I think the medicine is irritating my bladder. Fatigue is the worst symptom so far, doesn't help when I work midnights and am already tired. No diarrhea though, and no yeast infection yet. When they prescribed it too me, I was not happy! I just tell myself the benefits outweigh the risks. I just hope my Interstitial Cystitis symptoms subside when this is done.",Liz1979
204,Flagyl,Bacterial Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 19, 2013",36,"Before I started this medicine I was so worried because of all the reviews about bad side effects. I can honestly say I did not have a bad experience at all. I was on 500mg twice a day for 7 days. The 2nd day I was on it, I had very slight nausea in the evening but I started watching T.V and when the show was over my nausea was gone. The 3rd day, I had some wine and I was on my 2nd glass when I remembered I'm not supposed to drink while on Flagyl. I just finished my last dose & haven't experienced anymore nausea or anything. I've been lethargic the last 2 days but that may be due to getting my period. Not everyone has a bad reaction!",Anonymous
205,Flagyl,Bacterial Infection,10.0,,"February 10, 2013",18,"For the last few years I have had recurrences, sometimes as often as once a week of vomiting and diarrhea.  It seemed to be traced to exhaustion and fatty foods.  In the meantime, my wife contacted C. Difficile in the hospital.  Along the way, I may have contracted C.Diffcile too.  In any event, my doctor prescribe Flagyl, which I took four times a day for 10 days.  This cleared everything up but the problem kept occurring.  For the last 45 days I have been taking 2, 250 mg. capsules once a day.  Recently I have cut down to one.  Although I have had occasional diarrhea, there has been no vomiting or nausea.  ",JPCPSVA

It has no coating and dissolves instantly on your tongue, leaving a horrid taste behind.  It is upsetting to your stomach.  Taking it because it's effective.  Wish they'd add a coating.
