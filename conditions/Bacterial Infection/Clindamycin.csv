0,Clindamycin,Bacterial Infection,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 9, 2022",0,"Do not take this medicine. It’s just another pill doctors can make money off of. I took this for tonsillitis / bacteria in my throat and my legs were in excruciating pain the whole time. It felt like I had blood clots in them. I couldn’t sleep or sit. The only thing that would make the pain go away is when I would walk. I took so much Advil to counteract the pain that I got a stomach ulcer. I felt like the medicine was eating away at my body so I stopped and within 24 hours, the pain went away. I went on a detox because I felt that if I kept taking it, it would damage my nerves. The doctor said that I was crazy but I’ve heard people with similar stories. Take augmentin, amoxicillin, or penicillin. Stick to the classics. This was way too strong and damaging to the body. However, it did get rid of my throat infection in just a few days. But I could’ve taken amoxicillin and it would’ve done the same thing.",CLOE

2,Clindamycin,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 9, 2022",0,"First and foremost, this was my first time ever taking Clindamycin.I had an ear infection and I was on a round of augmentin from 12/19 til 12/29 for a double ear infection and my left ear healed but my right ear did not. Went back to the Dr and was prescribed a 10 day round of Clindamycin - take 4 times a day. I set alarms for myself every 6 hours and I do wake up around 4 or 5 am to take my first dose of the day. I've learned a trick with taking this to avoid the heartburn and side effects. Eat something small, drink 8 ounces of water, take the pill, then eat another small portion and drink another 8 ounces of water! I have YET to have any side effects since doing this. No diarrhea, no upset tummy! Within 48 hours of being on the medication I could tell a difference. 10/10 would recommend. Remember, everyone does different with antibiotics. Don't let 1 horrible review scare you!",Kristen
3,Clindamycin,Bacterial Infection,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2022",0,I will never use this drug again! I was diagnosed with a cyst and the dr. prescribed me this to prevent any infection it may have caused. I was supposed to use this drug 3x a day for 10 days and had to stop after day 3. This medicine made my hair fall out near my hairline!!!! (I'm a woman with a full head of hair mind you). It was noticeably balding. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE DRUG. Stay away if you can.,Anonymous
4,Clindamycin,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2021",1,"I have pretty good teeth but my very back right tooth got decayed and I ended up with an abscess.  The abscess spread into a radiating pain into my right jaw bone, right ear, and upper right back teeth.  It was debilitating. I ended up at the walk-in clinic and the emergency room it was so severe. I finally found a combo that worked for me to make the pain manageable until I could see a dentist and clindamycin 3 time a day was CRUCIAL to my treatment. If I didn’t take my clindamycin I couldn’t find relief. Until I saw the dentist and got the tooth completely pulled out in the back the infection never went away. However if you have a debilitating tooth abscess that’s spread and is causing you to literally lose sleep, and wake up in immense pain then clindamycin is a lifesaver until you can get dental care to get rid of your abscess. It’s very important to note that you do not need to lay down after taking clindamycin for at least 30 minutes and drink TONS of water",Savannah adams
5,Clindamycin,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 1, 2021",0,Been a life long IBS sufferer 20 years I took clindamycin for an infection of some type and it did wonders for my bowels. I felt better and 20 years later still has that amazing effect. My doctors do not want to prescribe it and for many people this medicine causes bad side affects. For what ever reason this antibiotic does absolute wonders for me and lasts for about 4 months of normal bowel activity. When not on it my IBS holds me hostage to a life that totally sucks. The gut is still the final frontier in terms of understanding it but this has done me wonders. I am only posting here in case anyone had similiar results. On another IBS post a few people said they had similiar results as me. Good luck everyone. Usual dosage 300 mg 3 x a day for 10 days,NW Native
6,Clindamycin,Bacterial Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 22, 2021",0,"I was given this as a preventative for some minor cosmetic surgery, only 4 days. I didn't get any major side effects as you will see here, but still feel like rubbish 4 days after stopping. I had loose stools, stomach is messed up but only minor heartburn and Iwas feeling a little dizzy and a lot anxious.  I seem to feel like this on any antibiotics, so am not sure what I'll try next for another upcoming surgery.  I guess this worked, I did not get an infection... but probably would not have anyway.",AZJJ

9,Clindamycin,Bacterial Infection,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 16, 2021",0,"I was in the ER because my leg was slightly swollen as was one of my toes.  My doctor told me to go get a doppler to look for a blood clot.  I was there for 8 hours. They did a doppler and found no blood clots.  My leg is not red, only a little swollen by about 3/4 inch the toe also has slight swelling.  They found my WBC count elevated at 16.5.  Over the years for no reason, my WBC has been elevated to over 20 with no underlying condition.  Since I am allergic to penicillin they told me to take this horrible drug which is incredibly powerful.  There was no rationale to it. I am having the worse cramping and pains.  I will probably stop taking it.",Cynic345
10,Clindamycin,Bacterial Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 25, 2021",1,"I'm on my second course of clindamycin for a dental infection I cannot have addressed for another 3 weeks or so due to appointment availability with the oral surgeon.  The first course was back a couple months ago and it knocked the infection down to the point that my toothache abated.  Then, six weeks went by and the infection and the nasty toothache came back.  I got my clindamycin script refilled and started another course yesterday morning.  Already, 30 hours later, my toothache is almost gone and I'm pretty much back to normal.   So, it really works...  Like a lot of antibiotics though, clindamycin messes up the bacterial balance in my stomach and I feel like I swallowed an anvil for the first few hours after a dose.  But this passes and, anyway, it is a lot better than the toothache, which was a real doozy.  I'll be glad when its over and the bad teeth are gone and I get my new permanent bridge, though.",R.

Around July 29th is when I took it. No August 21st and still slowly getting over all the bad effects.

As a result I was prescribed CLANDIMYCIN HCL 300 (4 pills a day for 7 days). The tooth pain stopped 2 days after I started taking CLANDIMYCIN, the face swelling continued for 10 days. However 3 days after I stopped taking CLANDAMYCIN I ended up in Emergency Room with the heart palpitations (blood pressure 114/80/157). I was diagnosed with Atrial Flutter and referred to cardiologist. Cardiologist recommended ablation to prevent those type of events from happening in the future. I do not know whether cardiovascular event was caused by post bridge replacement infection and inflammation or by antibiotic but in the future I would preferred to be prescribed another antibiotic.",Anna

Dentist prescribed 150 mg of clindamycin every 6 hours. After taking for three days, the pain is mostly gone. I drink a lot of water and typically eat yogurt for breakfast, so I didn’t initially experience any side effects. Today, day three, my throat felt scratchy and I had an annoying dry cough. Of course I was worried because of covid, but when I came across this forum, I realized it’s likely acid driving the cough. Overall, the experience has been fine.

19,Clindamycin,Bacterial Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 21, 2021",1,So. My dentist prescribed clindamycin for my tooth that is at the root canal phase. I am getting extracted next week. 150 Mg every 6 hours. First symptom I noticed was a really dry throat that made me cough like I couldn’t breathe or swallow right. I downed a glass of water! And ever since that I have been and have had no issues. So before clyndamycin I could not have cold water in my mouth at all from the shooting pain I can now tolerate it! It has made my tooth very much sensitive and fragile where I can’t even chew on the opposite side or it hurts. There is lots of pressure in my tooth and cheek and jaw a little burning it is uncomfortable and unpleasant but compared to what I went through before this was nothing. It is creating discomfort as the days go by but it is attacking I guess #hanginginthere,M619

24,Clindamycin,Bacterial Infection,1.0,,"April 10, 2021",1,"I took this for a possible tooth infection after having an extraction. I started them on a Sat and by that evening, I was experiencing diarrhea. By Sunday, it was extreme and my dentist told me to stop them on Monday. My primary dentist told me she won't prescribe them because she has had patients end up in the hospital a month later after stopping them.  I took probiotics, a bland BRAT diet, and hydrated too. The concern is that I had CDAD ( C. difficile-associated disease), which can be fatal. I would never take this antibiotic ever again. Penicillin is fine for me. I'm still experiencing extreme side effects and it's been over 1 week since I stopped. My primary physician has to check on me every day in case things get worse and I have to go to the E.R.

33,Clindamycin,Bacterial Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2020",12,"Was prescribed this drug to clear up a mild case of skin infection on my foot. I'll be honest, I was absolutely TERRIFIED to take this drug after reading the horrific reviews on this site and many others. Took 4 pills a day 300mg for 1 week with absolutely no issues. Worst I experienced was a foul taste in my mouth and mild heartburn when I forgot to eat my yogurt and drink sufficient water for that day. Ate before each pill and took at least 2 small cups of yogurt each day and before dosage. Infection cleared up pretty well and has faded from the rich purple color it was from before taking the medicine. Don't be fooled by the negative reviews on this drug, just make sure to drink with a FULL glass of water and have something in your stomach before taking the pill. Also, be sure to wait at least 30 min to an hour before lying down after taking the pill to avoid heartburn. Having a probiotic works wonders with this drug in my opinion.",catposse

I actually have 3 days left but I'm doing quite well.  My advice, talk to a pharmacist and check online what to do while taking clindamycin because it can be quite harmful. I bought a tonne of probiotic dairy free yogurt and probiotic capsule (5 billion strength).  With every dose of clindamycin I would eat a small meal usually gluten free toast and something else (maybe an egg for protein) and have a serving of gluten free yogurt and drink at least 500ml of water when taking the clinda.  After 2.5 hours I eat another small meal and take a probiotic capsule.  I didn't eat anything heavy or hard to digest.  Basically my diet consists of gluten free bread, an egg or two a day, cereal, soy milk and dairy free yogurt and lots of water. Sounds like a bland diet but it's served me well.

I’ve taken this times before but this time my stools have been pretty normal, soft but not diarrhea. I take it with whatever drink I’ve got with me that time of day (today it’s a monster energy) and it hasn’t been upsetting my stomach.I will say this time around my appetite has increased ten fold, and my brain does seem kinda foggy here and there. I do remember the first day or two on it my joints were sore but that’s a small price to pay for getting rid of whatever is causing you the pain in the first place.

Since then absolutely zero problems!I don’t eat carbs but have relaxed to include some for taking tablets and allow food to get into stomach before taking table.

As far as side effects go, I read all the horror stories in these reviews and I did my best to avoid them. I took a probiotic every morning and I ate probiotic yogurt twice a day. I ate a full meal before the pill each time and waited about 10 minutes before I took it. I drank two glasses of water with the pill and I did not lay down for 40 minutes. I avoided all the crazy side effects, I didn't get heartburn or anything like that. For reference I am 23 years old, female and I weigh about 135. The only side effects that I experienced was actually after the pill and it is constant pooping, multiple times a day, for about a month now. I only started to experience this when I stopped taking the probiotics which were countering the effects of the antibiotic which I guess last a while after you finish it.

It's my third day and have never actually experienced the worst things people kept saying, including severe heart burns and crippling internal organs. I think we differ in experiences, but I think how it is taken is also important. I've always eaten probiotics before and after this. I drink the pill in full stomach and also together with 1 1/2 glasses of water. The only side effects I experience were mild painless diarrhea, light-headedness, and tolerable burning sensation at feet. Nothing more. With regards to the healing of my tonsillitis, it was actually fast. The white spots seem fading, but still there. The pain when I swallow is still there, but became better. On this third day, experiencing fever also faded away - thanks to this antibiotic. I will give it 8 stars for being effective, but still hating how the diarrhea wakes me up at night hahah",Danyael

96,Clindamycin,Bacterial Infection,4.0,,"June 11, 2019",8,"I was prescribed 14-days of Clindamycin to treat a gum infection prior to a tooth extraction. There are so many side effects of this medication, none of which were explained to me. First, when you take each dose, it must be with a large glass of water and  you MUST not lay down for at least 30-minutes after taking it. If you lay down immediately after taking it, it can get stuck in  your esophagus causing extreme irritation and burning sensations. It is miserable. So if you are taking it 4 times a day, expect to wake up and sit up for 30 minutes at least once a night. After taking this medication, I had severe nausea at bedtime every night for six months. Probiotic yogurts helped mask the symptoms, but I eventually asked my doctor about it. Apparently if you have any acid reflux and take Clindamycin, your esophagus can become severely damaged by the acid and cannot heal on its own. Thus, I had to take a month of Prilosec to reduce my acid production so my esophagus could heal and the nausea would stop.",varthdader

Yes it does create more acid in the stomach but doesn't happen until around the 7th day so be careful not to go past that day and just listen to the drs since they DO know what they're talking about. One tip I would like to pass along is when taking this drug, take it with some yogurt for the good bacteria which should eliminate the side effects.

By day 5 she was vomiting and having severe chest pain and refused to continue the medicine saying it was making her miserably ill. I do believe it’s because I couldn’t get her to drink enough fluids when she took the pill to wash it down good.

177,Clindamycin,Bacterial Infection,9.0,,"March 12, 2018",10,"Clindamycin is a very relevant drug as are its side effects.  Knowing the side effects and how to combat them helps.  Clindamycin is a strong antibiotic in relation to what dentists usually prescribe.  It is usually given to eliminate infection fast.  If you don't feel this is the case, ASK your dentist.  Other options: penicillin, amoxicillin & augmentin.  Eating before antibiotics is far better than trying to eat something after you feel awful.  I can't preach probiotics enough & live culture yogurt, especially for women.  Heartburn can be rough once its set in.  Taking Prilosec ahead and combating residual with a fast acting OTC antacid is usually best.  Remember, just because your doctor prescribed this doesn't mean they know all of its side effects.

It must however be taken as directed, meaning you should probably eat something before you take it, you must take the entire prescription, and follow proper dosaging instructions.  If you fail to do this, your infection can return, the bacteria can become resistant, which means the bacteria could become immune, and you will no longer be able to take this antibiotic.  As someone who is not able to take antibiotics like penicillin due to a life-threatening allergy, I consider this to be a wonder drug.
