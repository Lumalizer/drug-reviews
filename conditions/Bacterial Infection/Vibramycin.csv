1,Vibramycin,Bacterial Infection,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 12, 2013",147,"I was diagnosed with a bacterial sinus infection and was prescribed this antibiotic, due to being allergic to amoxicillin. The pills are 100 mg each I am to take twice daily. At this time many of my sinus symptoms have dissipated which is an excellent sign that i'm finally on the mend. I haven't had any side effects with this, and have taken as directed.
