2,Keflex,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 8, 2020",22,Suffered from osteomyelitis in femur from age 16 ( now aged  80 ) the osteomyelitis became chronic 10 years ago and now take 2 keflex 500 a day full time.

3,Keflex,Bacterial Infection,10.0,,"October 15, 2019",50,"My Endodontist put me on Keflex (Cephalexin) 500 mg per day 4 X per day for a bacterial infection for a root canal that had to be retreated. I was skeptical as I often cannot finish antibiotics due to the awful side effects. I am very sensitive to medicine. This one has had no side effects for me. With that being said, I do take a probiotic (florajen) several hours before taking Keflex.  The probiotic is taken 1 x per day while on antibiotics and is found in the pharmacy as it has to be refrigerated. No prescription is required for probiotic.",LuvNature
4,Keflex,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 9, 2019",38,I went to the emergency room for a tooth abscess and they prescribed me keflex 500mg four times a day for 10 days. I have had zero side effects. It worked fast and took the infection right away. I had a little sore throat the whole 7 days but I was sneezing before I took the keflex so it probably a virus or allergies. My throat looks fine. But  highly recommend Keflex cause there are barely any side effects.,Bookie1976
5,Keflex,Bacterial Infection,9.0,,"February 17, 2019",56,"I was prescribed 500mg (Keflex) four times a day, for ten days. This was for a boil that I've had for eight years, I thought it was a pimple but when it got worse then ever I saw a doctor who confirmed it as a boil which then proceeded to try lancing and squeezing  it  I almost become unconscious this is how bad it has become. Anyways you are here for the drug review, the only side effect that I noticed was a slight tired feeling. I have anxiety so I didn't take the pills until around a week after being prescribed for a fear of side effects, there is nothing to be worried about trust that it will help you. Now my boil is completely gone and I can relax.",Zillakami
6,Keflex,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2018",47,"Took it for 7 days for a tooth infection, took the pain away on the 3rd day, no adverse reactions.  Had a reaction to Bactrim so I was hesitant to take antibiotics, however I'm confident in Keflex now.  Stop stressing and take it.",SB
7,Keflex,Bacterial Infection,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 24, 2018",17,"Hubby has a bad tooth, recently started hurting him extremely bad. Got hold of a dentist to get the tooth out. He prescribed keflex 250mg, for first 3-4 doses he was to take 2 x 3 doses then 1 cap x 3/day until finished.  Within 1 dose, his tooth pain went away  however on 2nd to 3rd dose the nausea, vomiting,  horrible stomach pain that he describes as a nasty pain  which he has to make himself puke which gives him short term relief. So if he is able to tolerate the rest of the duration of the script, this will be added to his list of meds he can't take",Hubbyswife
8,Keflex,Bacterial Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 19, 2017",5,"first my dentist prescribed amoxicillin for my tooth abscess, but when I went in for the extraction, I still had it, so he prescribed this. I lost a days worth, they fell out of my pocket. But I took the rest, and I still feel it slightly. It had no side effects for me.",bpmabq

10,Keflex,Bacterial Infection,10.0,,"October 12, 2017",12,"I some how got bit by a spider on my upper thigh area a year ago. No idea what kind of spider it was except I had a really bad reaction to it which concerned me because most times things like that don't affect me much. I ended up going to the hospital and was prescribed Keflex 500mg 4 times/day for 10 days. I noticed improvements within a few days and it cleared up beautifully. I had no side effects whatsoever. Today I had to go see a doctor again about another bite with similar reactions. He also prescribed Keflex 500 for the same dosage and time period. I'm hoping for the same results as last time, but thinking of checking into some probiotics due to the strength of the prescription.",Thing1
11,Keflex,Bacterial Infection,10.0,,"July 5, 2017",55,"I had a really bad cold and viral bronchitis and I ended up with nasal cellulitis of all things (infection in my nose and on my face). I took this medication and on day three, it was clearing up nicely and by day 5 the infection is gone. I had virtually no side-effects other than sleepiness, but I think that's normal when you're fighting an infection. I took 500 mg x 4 times a day and I had no stomach or intestinal issues at all. It was great.",AndieReviewer

14,Keflex,Bacterial Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2012",80,"Very effective antibiotic on two (2) separate events for oral abscess! Usually a straight Penicillin customer, I am & Doc prefers Amoxicillin (not efficacious for me). Compromise medicine: Keflex is the most foul-smelling thing I ever wanted to swallow because it works... so hold your breath!",Some1one
15,Keflex,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 30, 2012",105,"I had an abscess on my upper gum resulting from terrible dentist work. I had also been prescribed amoxicillin 500mg, however after a week of taking amoxicillin the pain/swelling did not go away it got noticeably worse. However after taking my first full dose of Keflex swelling reduced and gradually faded out by the time my dosage was complete. Would highly recommend Keflex.",hi5
16,Keflex,Bacterial Infection,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 11, 2012",172,"I was prescribed Keflex (Cephalexin) after having surgery to prevent infection, and wanted to add to the list of side effects.  They do not mention acid reflux, which I had every time I took the capsule (4 times a day, for 10 days). Also women need to take a probiotic while on this medication as it decreases natural flora and you can get yeast infection. I learned this the hard way by not eating enough yogurt while on this medication and not taking any probiotics. Just wanted to give a heads up and hopefully spare many women this highly uncomfortable experience.",Anonymous
17,Keflex,Bacterial Infection,8.0,,"May 24, 2012",70,"I have used this medicine for years for many different conditions including bronchitis, boils, bladder infection, sinusitis among a few others.  The problem though, has become since I have used it so many times, I am almost resistant to it and need a larger dose or longer dosing schedule to clear up a more severe case of the ailment.  When it works, it works well.",SicklySue
18,Keflex,Bacterial Infection,7.0,,"June 2, 2011",81,"I was prescribed Keflex for an infection that occurred after root canal went bad. Evidently the previous dentist had not been able to successfully remove all of the nerve and pulp and over time an infection resulted.Keflex was well tolerated by me and helped to reduce the swelling within the gum until I was able to have a root canal retreatment in order to remove the rest of the nerve and pulp.The rating that I provided is due to the fact that this medication required 4 doses daily which I felt there must have been some other medication available that required less commitment. Still, it did work and I would take it again if prescribed.",RxGuineapig
