0,Doxycycline,Bacterial Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 13, 2022",0,"I was amazed at how many conditions this treats.It’s the first time I’ve ever used it and I’m 48.This drug must be high quality and more expensive.I had this for a possible pelvic infection 14 days 100mg 2 times a day. I had no side effects only dry mouth.I think due to the water intake helped as this is a dehydrating medication. I usual drink a bottle 1.5 litre day and night . On  this medication must of been drinking 2litre.In the night I have a habit of waking up drinking water and going to toilet about 3 times a night. While take this medication I had to drink more water as I was waking up with dry mouth.If you can hydrate I think it will help keeping away the side affects like headaches, dizziness which are natural if you get dehydrated.I took this with food or just after food .Spread it to time of 11-12hrs space but took it 2hrs before I went to sleep.After finishing this course I felt confident that any infection had gone and I felt better to..Good Antibiotics:)",Gina

I weight 112 lbs and I’m 4’11. The ENT prescribed 100 mg x a day for a sinus infection. After the 2nd day I could actually hear my heart beat in my head‼️  Bad headache, fatigued, and woke up with a massive hangover. I don’t drink. By the 3rd day I couldn’t remember how many kids I have. I’m sure this drug has helped a lot of patients. But I rather have a sinus infection. I’m back to normal and actually know how many kids I have and what my name is. I found comfort in over the counter nasal spray. Sad.",Arg

The first day I took it I got in the shower, and about 30 minutes later I was all of a sudden got super hot, worst stomach pains ever and nausea. I got sick and threw up all of the medication. I thought maybe this happened because I took it on an empty stomach like it says to do on the bottle, so the next day I attempted again. The 2nd day I made sure I ate and washed down well with water.. Again I had stomach pains but even worse, because this time it wouldn’t come back up. I was so miserable that I sat over the toilet for a hour trying to make myself puke. The pain lasted about 2 hours before it went away. Other side effects I’ve been having is diarrhea, headaches, and insomnia for some reason. Now at this point I just prepare myself for the worst before taking this antibiotic.

9,Doxycycline,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 1, 2021",0,Not the drug for me. First time I took it for a suspected infection and it made me feel so sick I was bedridden for over a week. About 5 days in and I couldn't stop vomiting. 10 years later I was prescribed it for a possible infection that I had no symptoms of. 3 days in and I could barely get out of bed and when I forced myself to get up I passed out within the hour with a weird head pressure.

10,Doxycycline,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 1, 2021",1,"Horrible. I will NEVER take this again. I was hesitant to even start but everyone told me it would be fine so I did. I took 2 doses for a post-cyst-excision damage control type thing, and I am not taking my third to seventh doses. EXTREME nausea. I’m on the couch trying to keep it in as I type, and this is ALMOST A DAY after my last dose. This is a BAD medicine. Also caused intracranial pressure with headaches and fatigue. I just cannot do this medicine. I have never felt so queasy in my life. I will be taking cephalexin, my less harsh go-to, whenever I need this type of thing again.

12,Doxycycline,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 4, 2021",0,I'm on doxycycline for my 2 time in just over 1 year and I've not had any issues with this medication. My reasons for taking it is for reoccurring infection called Mersa and seems that everyone has this but certain things trigger it like cigarette smoking and nerves among other activities consult your doctor. Doxycycline is pretty simple and straight forward my doctor said 1st day take 2 at once then follow next and following days with 2 daily but take one in the AM followed with dose 2 in Pm and if there's any stomach issues try eating a small meal or a snack with the pill. Just make sure you're taking the pills close to same time every time that'll give you best results and cause a small build-up to get rid of any infection that's listed. Any side affects or serious affects see your doctor other than that. I've never had an issue or side affects with this.,Michael S.

I never completed the 14 day course as I stopped on day 12.   It did get rid of the pneumonia but it also made me very sick.

There are many other antibiotics, it doesn't have to be this one for my case. I'll elaborate; I received the medication for acne, which isn't very ""life threatening"". The side effects I got were vomiting, diarrhea and esophagitis. Additionally, I decided to stop taking the medication after the esophagitis, which made it extremely painful to swallow and lay down.

When I'm prescribed a drug, I come onto these sites and scour the reviews, usually terrified from all the negative ones I see. I'm not sure why people leave these extremely negative reviews.

17,Doxycycline,Bacterial Infection,1.0,,"July 19, 2021",0,"I woke up Friday with a minor intermittent ache in my upper canine tooth. I figured that it could wait until Monday. By Saturday morning the swelling in my cheek was the size of a golf ball. Anyhow, being the weekend I was unable to get ahold of the dentist. I had nobody to drive me to the ER, and there is no way that I could have driven myself in that kind of pain, so I decided to take some Doxycycline that I had. I started off by taking two pills then followed the directions on the bottle of two pills once a day. This pain became so bad that I felt myself on the verge of literally passing out from it. By sunday AM the swelling had increased to where my eye was swollen shut. I was finally got a ride to the emergency room. A few hours after a dose of corticosteroids and a dose of Clindamycin, I feel much better. The Doxycline did nothing for this infection. Not even slow it down.

Anyway so my first sign was my lips got really puffy. Then it felt like I was being choked. Keep in mind I already can't breathe from my illness! I make it thru the night but the next day the stomach pain starts. Bowels working  as normal. I take 4 pills total before it gets to my mind. I feel so jittery that I can't stand myself.
