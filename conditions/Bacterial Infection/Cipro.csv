0,Cipro,Bacterial Infection,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 25, 2021",1,"This was a bit scary to be on because of possible side effects but it worked. I had a severe inner ear infection for a year. It started with sinus infections, then inner ear. It went to my tonsil and adenoids.  A Z-pack, then 10 days of normal antibiotics, then Cipro last. I was nauseated the first dose but ate some crackers and it settled. I followed the rules to the letter of how to take and what not to take with it. I was also on a corticosteroid so was very careful not to strain or work too hard. Had no real problems with this.",Blue jeans
1,Cipro,Bacterial Infection,1.0,,"July 28, 2019",36,"Without a CT or any proper diagnosis of diverticulitis, based on symptoms I was prescribed Cipro twice a day for 10 days. On day 3 I woke in a panic early in the morning thinking I was dying with the worst feeling of panic and terror I have ever felt. Day 4 was worse. I looked up the side effects after the 8th pill (evening day 4) and every single bizarre symptom I was having including the panic attacks and psychiatric systems, neuropathy, major abdominal pain and worsened diarrhea were there . Terrified, I decided to stop the medication immediately. I had no idea that I had just been poisoned by a Fluoroquinolone. 2 months later I had a CT scan that said NO Diverticulitis. Fluoroquinolones are extremely dangerous, as ear drops and as pills and should be pulled off the market. Doctors who prescribe these pills that make us sick and destroy our lives don't take any responsibility or apologize or help with the multitude of side effects and permanent damage.",macandrea

3,Cipro,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 9, 2017",19,"I was diagnosed with an abdominal infection after stool testing. I took ONE pill and ended up in the ER. Within minutes of swallowing Cipro, my lips started to swell—then my eyes and whole face followed. My throat started getting scratchy so I went to the ER because I was scared my throat would swell to the point that I couldn't breathe. After this incident, I thoroughly researched Cipro and along with other drugs in its class—I will never take any of them. They are so scary. Yes, it's true that any drug can cause harm, but these drugs carry a much greater risk. Much greater.",CP1.2
4,Cipro,Bacterial Infection,1.0,,"August 24, 2016",21,"The severe side effect after only 2nd pill of cramps in calves, legs and shoulders were not worth the medications use.  Very scary.  No one told me the damage could be permanent, not dr or pharmacy- this should be advised up front.  Will never use again.",Moose1999

8,Cipro,Bacterial Infection,3.0,,"October 19, 2015",15,I was prescribed Cipro for a nasty and on going sinus infection.  I realized after many months of physical therapy on a bad case of tennis elbow that when I quit Cipro the tennis elbow disappeared.  The side effects listed tendon problems.  I believe it affected my elbow rather than other tendons.,Golfer2
9,Cipro,Bacterial Infection,10.0,,"February 24, 2015",36,I have taken Cipro for several sinus infections. It is probably the most effective treatments you can get. I have stubborn sinus infections so many antibiotics don't work. I take the 500 mg tablet.,akasha14
