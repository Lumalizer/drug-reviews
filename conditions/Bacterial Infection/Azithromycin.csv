0,Azithromycin,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2022",0,Nauseous and my anxiety got really bad. I felt psychotic too. It may be because I have epileptiform activity in my temporal lobe and have a fast brain. I took both Azithromycin and Doxycycline. Doxycycline gave me anxiety but not as bad as this one.,Anonymous
1,Azithromycin,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 16, 2021",0,"I was recovering from a long COVID/flu infection and feeling much better, but I thought I should be retested before going to the dentist. But instead, the NP put me on a Z-Pak, saying re-testing was not recommended this soon. (?) I was told the azithromycin would prevent any possible lingering bacterial infection in my respiratory system. I took only the first two tablets, then had a HORRIBLE night trying to sleep, hurt all over, developed thick, heavy drainage which I'd never had before, and woke up exhausted and in the deepest, darkest depression I've felt in decades. Then I read that this drug can also cause hearing loss, and I had already lost the hearing in one ear two years ago. Then anxiety through the roof! This whole ordeal was like a waking nightmare! (Had to cancel the dental appt.) I will never take this stuff (for me) again! Had it put on my ""DO NOT PRESCRIBE"" list! And changing my PCP.",Suddenly sicker

I suspected I had a sinus infection & went to the ER because I couldn’t get in to see my PCP for weeks. I took the Zpack as prescribed (my last dose was last Thursday) I still feel like I have a sinus headache in addition to dizziness, fatigue, diarrhea & anxiety. I felt after taking it & worse I ended up back in the ER & was told they didn’t find a sinus infection at all & I need to follow up with a Neurologist because they couldn’t find anything on the CT that could cause the headaches either! I had a horrible reaction to a medication last year (Lexapro) which increased my anxiety symptoms. I have been in therapy & doing well with no panic attacks in months. I feel like I possibly set myself back taking the Zpack. It was my first & LAST time taking it,I NEVER experienced these side effects taking Amoxicillin.

I take the Azithromycin always with a meal. I have found taking it this way means I have no side effects although it is a very low dose. So far so good, I've taken for less than a month but its helped with the mucous issues with the asthma which is said to be caused by chronic inflammation. I'm under better control which is great.

Mostly I'm gassy and my intestines are a bit bubbly, but nothing that's overly bothersome. My infection is starting to clear up too after two weeks of pain.

I took two 500mg tablets right after eating dinner and then took a Zofran right after (definitely recommend asking for zofran with this medication as I believe that’s what saved me) but the only side effects I had this time was mild nausea and gas after about 2 hours that only lasted 30min or so.,Kay

It is very effective and I also used a probiotic an hour after my dose of Z-Pak. Probiotics work well for me and with bacterial bronchitis it helps restore gut flora. I stay on Probiotics and have not had reoccurring bronchitis. I only report this to you as my own experience. Always check in with your MD when you use any OTC products such as Probiotics.

Took the full dose. 2 on the first day, then 4 the next 4 days. I would take again, if needed. I am allergic to the cillins, and had more side effects from when I would be prescribed erthomyicin.

My urine culture was positive for the bacteria Ureaplasma Urealyticum and I had urinary burning. 2 weeks of doxycycline did nothing to the symptoms.

First day, there was very mild nausea and stomach pain, also gassy. 2 days after the dose, my liver began to hurt, up until day 7 post the pills. I also spent 2 days mostly sleeping, I was so high/relaxed. I can't say that the burning is gone, so will request additional tests to check for other infections.

This is day 2 of taking it and I haven't felt the itching again (probably because I took half of the original dose which is what I'm supposed to take) I feel like if something more serious was going happen it would've happened last night, but you never know I am only on day 2 lol. But so far nothing serious has happened which I'm thankful for.

But the main issue is that I wouldn’t use it unless I have to. I have a history of gastritis and IBS, so taking this medication would normally give me a whole slew of digestive issues from nausea to vomiting to diarrhea. Only one occasion though had the side effects not been so prominent, when I’ve eaten a lot before taking the gel capsule version of it rather than the normal pill...perhaps the gel capsule version prevents too much damage to my stomach lining..",Always eating
