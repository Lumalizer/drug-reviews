0,Linezolid,Bacterial Infection,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 24, 2020",0,"This drug inezolid works great Was given the generic version after multiple treatment failures. I thought it would work faster than it did. Took about the full 10day course to feel the difference Side effects:Tired. Very especially at peak serum. Try to take a nap after you take your daytime pill. Like an hour after And take PM pill just before bed. Stool got soft. But nothing runny. No aches, no neuropathy, nothing scary. Great med!",Male32
1,Linezolid,Bacterial Infection,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 3, 2018",5,"Zyvox (linezolid):Have had both the IV and oral versions of this antibiotic.At the hospital, I had two different antibiotics before Zyvox and both worked much better from a subjective point of view.  My Cellulitis was quickly healing with the previous antibiotics.  When I was switched to Zyvox, the healing seemed much slower on the IV and the oral.  I have no idea what to eat and am fearful of an adverse reaction.  I was blown off by the hospital doctor when I mentioned I thought it was not working as well.  Why would anyone use this drug?",Ron
2,Linezolid,Bacterial Infection,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 17, 2016",3,"Zyvox (linezolid):It didn't work as fast as I thought it would. Very expensive! $3,600 Made me feel very sleepy and tired . I could sleep all day!",Melh9
3,Linezolid,Bacterial Infection,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 7, 2015",17,"Zyvox (linezolid):I was prescribed this generic for a raging infection contracted when I had a small surgical procedure done on my finger.  Within 24 hours of the procedure, my finger was inflamed and throbbing.  Keeflex was first prescribed and another 24 hours later was determined it had not touched the infection.  So, I was given Zyvox.  It totally eradicated the germ I had contracted.  I did have some bothersome side effects, mostly with my stomach just not feeling right.  Later in the second week, my tongue turned brown, but no other problems.  I was very tired most of the time, and could not decide if it was the med or the infection.",Sunshine Panky
