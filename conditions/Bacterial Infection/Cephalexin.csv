I had no symptoms, no issues but apparently, they found some bacteria in my urine. I started taking it as prescribed, trusting my doctor.Monday, I started spotting. Tuesday night, it picked up and resembled a period. Wednesday after some blood work, it shows my HCG is declining.I understand how these things can just happen, but I really can't help but wonder how an otherwise healthy pregnancy can just randomly end. Especially so soon after starting a medication I question whether or not I actually needed. Be cautious when taking this during early pregnancy.",K. N.

8,Cephalexin,Bacterial Infection,1.0,,"May 7, 2021",11,"I was going through severe anxiety, heart palpitations, tachycardia, body numbness, going in and out of another world.  I had new allergys, twitching when I would almost fall asleep, 21 ER visits later I found the answer. The antibiotic I was on for tooth infection caused severe ulcers all threw out my GI track, it can cause all of that.  I almost had a couple heart attacks before I realized this. Here is what my treatment is consisting of, beta blockers to control the heart palpitations ( you need them or it will get bad) Ativan to control the anxiety (this too will get worse) Steroids to fix your mental state, reduce intestinal swelling, and get your immune system back on track so your allergies stop (this too will get worse) and a PPI pill to stop the stomach acid so they can heal. Also I'm waiting for a scope treatment from a Gastro Doctor. I'm hoping I can make it until then but for anybody else experiencing what I did please get it addressed ASAP, I was told by every doctor it was anxiety and even banned from a ER",Justin Boyce

I'm honestly shocked that this antibiotic isn't making me sick.

After eating, especially diary, the bg's would settle in and after that, all my food is dumped out of me into the toilet with little warning and No time waste getting there.

108,Cephalexin,Bacterial Infection,9.0,,"March 10, 2013",197,"I've seen patient reviews where many terrible side effects of this drug were listed. After that, I was afraid to start taking Cephalexin! But my pharmacist said Keflex has been on the market for decades & most people have no problem with it.  I'm happy to report that I am one of those people! The only side effect I am having is a lot of smelly gas & very smelly bowel movements.(a result of the bad bacteria dying off, perhaps?). But that's a small price to pay to get rid of the infection in my ankle, so I'm quite satisfied.  Word to the wise: I think that most of the patient reviews we see online are from unsatisfied patients. Most people that have no problem with a medicine probably don't take the time to post, so keep that in mind.",LadyMadonna

The cephalexin is working after 2 days however it makes me itch; no hives just mild itching.  I make sure I take it with lots of water and I am eating yogurt to make sure I do not get a yeast infection.  If the itching worsens I will obtain a different antibiotic.  I am sure there is something else that won't make me itch.  I had some other antibiotic when I had a root canal that did not make me itch.,Ne Ne

I get real anal when it comes to taking medicine like this, for I have a fear of side effects and haven't taken antibiotics before.
