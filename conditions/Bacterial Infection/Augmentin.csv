0,Augmentin,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 9, 2022",0,This has been a terrible experience.  Given 875mg for 7 days for Diverculities.  Side effects are extremely tired anxiety complete loss of appetite bloating and full of gas extreme weakness in legs feel like passing out.  Worse than problem it  was for. One more day left and feel like passing on it.  Hopefully I will bounce back after it is out of system. Unless you can lay around and not have to function I would not take.  Could barely take a shower was so tired.  In my opinion bad stuff.,Terry Bear
1,Augmentin,Bacterial Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 31, 2021",0,"Occult infection (possibly prostatitis per urinalysis) causing me to experience severe feverless rigors (principally composed of intermittent, fast onset, violent full body shaking, ice cold hands, and blue fingernails that last 15 to 60 minutes per episode. I'm on day eight (500MG 2x/day) of a thirty day prescription of Augmentin. I am experiencing abdominal pain, abdominal spasms, esophageal spasms, hypertension, tachycardia, and irregular heartbeats (PVC's) as side effects. My blood glucose level is also elevated since starting Augmentin. I am desperately trying to tolerate the side effects, but I fear that I'm fighting a losing battle. Don't know where I go from here since I'm allergic to most antibiotics. After eight days (15 doses) on Augmentin, no relief from rigors yet.

Taking Pepto or Immodium takes care of that. After 3rd day, most symptoms of sinus infection are gone. No other side effects. This drug works well, but so do many other antibiotics for infection.

The cramps in my feet are still bad it's been almost a week since I stopped taking it. Went to my doctor she said it's a side effect from augmentin.

I was extremely nauseous and out of it, almost dizzy. I have a deadly fear of puking so I stopped taking it right after the first dose. I would never take this again because of the awful side effects.

7,Augmentin,Bacterial Infection,4.0,,"July 14, 2021",1,"I was prescribed Augmentin (500/125  three times a day for 10 days) by my dentist for a tooth infection.  The first day wasn’t so bad but by the second day, I could feel anxiety and nausea creeping in. On the third day I had a strong headache and stomach pain with loose stools. Although I never vomited. Over the next couple of days my blood pressure spiked significantly, had a difficult time sleeping and I felt very anxious along with the other above mentioned symptoms. The good news is that my tooth and jaw and ear pain went away caused by the tooth infection. DAY 7, I called my dentist and I explained my side effects to him and he advised that I go off the medicine. I have never had any severe reactions to any antibiotics in the past. Well at least for me this stuff is bad in my opinion. I don’t plan on taking it again although it did help my infection go away.",Npain

So, it seems to have potentially prevented infection.But wow, did it make me feel awful. Brain fog with difficulty focusing mentally and visually. No energy.Lots of nausea, lack of appetite, and generally feeling out of it.  Diarrhea occurs without enough fiber.As other have said I think it's increased my anxiety significantly. Haven’t had any panic attacks for a long time, until this beauty. I’m not sure I’ll ever know if it prevented an infection or not. I do know that it caused me to feel like absolute crud!",GS
11,Augmentin,Bacterial Infection,5.0,,"January 13, 2021",5,"Taking this for an unknown bacterial infection - confirmed with CBC but I personally suspect it's early onset of appendicitis. I'm on a pretty high dose according to my doc (500mg 3x daily) and oh man. The brain fog is maybe the worst symptom. It starts in about an hour after taking it and settles in for a few hours. It just feels hard to focus on anything, like my vision is blurred almost. Between that and the insomnia, nausea if I eat food anytime between doses, and diarrhea what a fun medication!! Loss of appetite too i've noticed. I think it's increased my anxiety too but i'm a bit of a hypochondriac to begin with so idk my anxiety might be increased just because this drug is whacky. I'm on this thing for 10 days. Today is day 3. Noticed an improvement in my infection symptoms I think? Much less abdominal pain, but its hard to get a good gauge on that when you're having diarrhea so much!!",kk

I left the hospital and was in the emergency room the next because after 2 doses and 24 hours it was actually spreading. After 48 hours the swelling finally started to go down which I was happy about but I started getting severe side effects as well.

I could smell things I haven't smelled in months. Day 3 vaginal itching, day 4 worse vaginal itching and headache. Decided to treat for yeast infection. Day 5 feeling better.

15,Augmentin,Bacterial Infection,1.0,,"November 20, 2020",10,"I was prescribed Augmentin for a severe infection at the root of the tooth (I don't even see dental abscess listed as an indication for use here, but the dentist seemed enthused).  I was in absolute agony, and the infection had to be cleared up before the tooth could be pulled.  Well, first came the sticker shock!  I couldn't believe my prescription was over $30 for a generic version, but figured this had to be good stuff.  Two days later no improvement, but explosive watery diarrhea every couple of hours despite probiotics.  Having been a caregiver, I recognized a C. diff infection.  Sure enough, Googling confirmed that Augmentin is notorious for inducing this!  I knew this wouldn't be tolerable for the remainder of the course of treatment, plus it can lead to colitis, so I begged to be switched to a ""plain"" antibiotic.  After a day on that, I already feel so much better, and thank goodness the C. diff seems to be resolving on its own.  The $2 price tag for amoxicillian was nice, too!",otterhere

I threw up after having severe nausea and headache. I went to after hours at 6:30pm and they gave me medicine Zofran and then a shot for nausea and said not to take any more that I was having a side affect to it. It did not help and I threw up 3 more times when I got home. Last time was 2am. I do not recommend this if you have not taken it before. It has been a horrible experience.,Jem
17,Augmentin,Bacterial Infection,7.0,,"June 12, 2020",9,It has been widely accepted that stopping antibiotic treatment early encourages bacteria to develop antibiotic resistance.

19,Augmentin,Bacterial Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 19, 2020",65,"After taking other antibiotics a couple of times over the last 12 months for sinus infections, I finally had a deep sinus infection which seeped through the top jaw and around a tooth. It had apparently been building up over time. I had just started Augmentin 875/125 when the periodontist found this. Before that I had tired completed 3 courses and all infection pain in my sinus, jaw, neck and shoulder have gone. After 12 months of trying physio, massage, nasal sprays, washes and antihistamines, as well as the odd antibiotic, Augmentin has been my saviour. It began to clear everything l didn’t even know was part of the infection within 3 days and the continued improvement has been unbelievable and surprising. No side effects at all, if l take at the start of a meal, although l have felt pretty tired. Brilliant drug!",Di

AVOID. Talk about severe vaginal itching! It's the kind of itching without odor or discharge; just full-fledged random itching. Short term remedy is Benadryl. I didn't know I was allergic until I was prescribed this for a sinus infection. So, it's been 6/10 days on Augmentin and I'm calling it quits.   To be fair: the sinus infection is all clear, so it does work. Apparently, this reaction happens to 1 out of 15 patients.",Ms

23,Augmentin,Bacterial Infection,1.0,,"October 31, 2019",15,I took Augmentin back in April 2016 to treat sinus and extreme cough/chest congestion. Within the first 24 hours I had a rash in all the places nobody would wants a rash. It was debilitating.I called the dr. back and said I’m not taking this. I can’t do it. Now here I am 3 1/2 years later and I have the same thing. What  prescription do they send to the pharmacy you ask? None other than Augmentin. I called them back and said absolutely not!!! I’m not going through this nightmare again!!!Now I’m stuck waiting for the DR to call me tomorrow to hopefully give me something else. Meanwhile I’m on week 2 of this and taking prednisone which is causing me insomnia and I still can’t lay down long enough to even try to sleep without choking. I guess what I would say is if you want to try Augmentin go for it. What happened to me doesn’t mean it will happen to you. But just an FYI I do medical billing and I asked several of my clients APN and MD if they would recommend Augmentin and they all said NO.,JJ

HOWEVER, side effects were terrible; still around after completing 10-day treatment.  Even with daily probiotics and yogurt the digestive/intestinal issues were bad, constant trips to bathroom; eating would immediately create ""stomach talk""; could not leave house; had to cancel family trip as travel would have been difficult.  Lethargic, weak, blurry vision, exhausted; with all of this it really affected my mentality.   FYI:  On the 2nd day when side effects began, I spoke with my pharmacist who encouraged me to stay on it if I could endure these ""common"" side effects, none being allergic.  It has worked but still healing from side effects.  ",Cool Mamaw
