1,Penicillin,Bacterial Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 11, 2021",1,Penicillin VK (penicillin v potassium):Been taking now for 5 days! Told to take for 10 days! Abscess on my wisdom tooth which is impacted and swollen gums and glands! Swelling went down some put pain is still very active! No side effects minus a headache here and there but that may be from the pain pressure of the wisdom tooth! Feel like I should have some type of relief by now but I have 5 more days! Will see how this goes,Boujie
2,Penicillin,Bacterial Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 4, 2020",3,"Penicillin VK (penicillin v potassium):I don't like the Penicillin VK pill I was taking this for swollen gums  and a bad tooth and it made me depressed, feverish, weak, and a slight headache, and it did not seem to work much on gums as soon as I stop taking I felt better",Banks111
3,Penicillin,Bacterial Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 21, 2020",0,"Dentist prescribed this penicillin v medication because the tip of a root canal had broken off and caused an infection.  I took 500 mg four times per day for 7 days.  At the end of the 7 days, both legs were swollen from the ankle to the hip and it was difficult and painful to walk.  My PCP prescribed a mild diuretic to reduce the swelling, but I continued to have severe knee pain.  The swollen knees led to an arthritic flare up.  As a result, the severe pain still exists nearly four weeks after the initial swelling.  My PCP and physical therapist said It was the potassium that caused all the swelling and pain.  Will not take this drug again in the future.",Seajay

7,Penicillin,Bacterial Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 25, 2019",23,"Penicillin VK (penicillin v potassium):I'm taking this for a tooth infection that started to spread. My lymph nodes were very painful and swollen. This med makes me feel dizzy, anxious and a pressure in my head. It reminds me of taking cold medications. I hate that part of it. But, it also seems to be fighting this tooth infection. My tooth and lymph nodes are not hurting as bad, and swelling has gone down. Still have a few days left though.",KriCro
8,Penicillin,Bacterial Infection,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 17, 2019",16,Penicillin VK (penicillin v potassium):I was diagnosed with BV and was prescribed Penicillin and MetroGel. I’ve had worse BV in the past and no side effects from the pills I took but these ohmygosh I give 5 stars only because I know the medicine is working but the way I’ve been feeling the last week is such a drag. My body is achy and I feel extremely tired and not to exaggerate but even a little depressed and can’t focus and it’s effected my memory. Makes me feel like I just want to lay in bed. The smell of the pills is foul and my urine smells like the pills. I understand antibiotics make you tired from them working but I’ve never felt so lethargic before and I drink plenty of water and I eat very healthy. If I ever get BV again I hope I don’t have to take Penicillin I’m not giving negative review it’s just how my body reacted to it everyone is different.,Vanessa

12,Penicillin,Bacterial Infection,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 17, 2017",14,"Penicillin VK (penicillin v potassium):This is my first time taking such a high dosage of this medicine, which was usual for me but I had abad tooth ache. I have taken penicillin before but at a lower dosage, however this new med has a higher dosage and the side effects are bothersome. I do not truly feel it is worth continuing to take. I'm consulting the doctor that prescribed the med to me from our local hospital's ER.",msbeautifulll68
13,Penicillin,Bacterial Infection,9.0,,"December 15, 2016",25,"Penicillin VK (penicillin v potassium):Honestly, I felt better about 4 hours after begging treatment with this for an infected/abcessed tooth.  Surprisingly quick, considering the amount of pain I was in.  The downside, for me at least, seems to be slight nausea/dizziness.  I had taken ibuprofen earlier due to pain, so this meant bad times in front of the toilet.  Be careful with other meds that may upset your stomach.",Bunnybuns
