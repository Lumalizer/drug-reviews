0,Pregabalin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,9.0,,"March 29, 2022",1,I have been on pregabalin for 3 weeks now. I started with 75 mg taken at night then 75 mg am and pm and am now at 150 mg am and pm. When I first started on the low dose I crashed. I went from a very active person to sleeping 24/7 . I gave up after 2 days as I could not stand that side effect. However faced with little options as I was not able to deal with the side effects of the antidepressant and in Canada at least it is very difficult to receive pain medications for very long I decided to give pregabalin another try. I must admit I was concerned about the side effect of weight gain but the pain was so bad I decided that was worse than that side effect.So after about a week maybe less I was surprised to find that my body was able to get used to the med and I no longer feel the exhaustion or constant groggy feeling experienced at first. It really works for the pain. I am grateful for that. So far no weight gain. However I am early in on this med. But so far so good!,Mel
1,Pregabalin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 19, 2022",0,Lyrica (pregabalin):After taking 2 x 75mg for approximately 4 weeks my pc increased the dose to 3 x 75mg with instructions to increase to 4 x 75mg after a week. 4 days into taking 4 a day I was horribly sleepy and really moody and anxious. This came to a head on day 6 when I screamed at my husband about anything and everything then in the afternoon fell into a deep sleep and waking up at 5.30pm not knowing what day it was or if it was morning or afternoon. That was when I decided to reduce the Lyrica to 3 x a day until I could get hold of my pc. I don't want to continue taking this medication. It hasn't helped my post herpetic neuralgia pain at all and nearly destroyed my marriage.,Mom

4,Pregabalin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 11, 2020",21,"Lyrica (pregabalin):Got shingles on right side of scalp into my right eye May 25, 2020. Specialist got infection out of eye. Prescribed Pregabalin. On max dose- take 200mg every 8 hrs and the pain starts back about 6-7 hrs after dose. It has been 5 months and still dealing with sharp, stinging pain!! I have also gained 25 lbs. Dr said deal with weight gain or pain. I chose weight gain because pain is extreme. Want something that will heal the nerve damage. I also get severe itching on right eyebrow, Forehead which is numb and inside corner of eye. I’m hoping this will end soon but I have a feeling it won’t. Hopefully in the near future there will be some thing that will heal the nerve pain.",Hurting still

Pain excruciating and numbness on left side. I was misdiagnosed as having psoriasis until I went to hospital almost 3 weeks later as I could not stand the pain in my head any longer all left side.

7,Pregabalin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,3.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 24, 2018",6,"I had shingles around 8 years ago - extremely bad - rash slow to develop. Severe pain but not diagnosed. I  diagnosed myself - showed GP again and was put on antivirals - too late to help. I have had PHN (postherpetic neuralgia) ever since. I take 150 mg of Lyrica morning and evening plus Tramadol. I get breakthrough pain but I've tried extra medication but I am falling down drunk and can sleep and sleep. Now I  stick to my dose exactly, no matter what, Well my memory is bad and getting  worse. I even forget the names of things.  I am slowly reducing the Lyrica.  I have read about it and memory and cognition problems. I have only just realised that is what's wrong. I have several friends my age -78 and my memory is the worst. I thought it was age. Now I am sure the Lyrica is ageing my brain.  Occasionally I will get actual holes in my memory and forget days and I can't focus. It is great for pain but not worth it. Goodbye Lyrica!",Flowers

The doctor prescribed Lyrica and has worked fantastic for me and my postherpetic neuralgia for past 10 months.  Not sure if it will ever go away and if I can be on Lyrica forever.

10,Pregabalin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,6.0,,"October 17, 2017",33,Lyrica (pregabalin):I got shingles on my scalp left side forehead and eye.  I was in hospital for 5 days on an IV for both antivirus and antibiotics.  The doctor had said that it was the worse shingles he had seen. After the scabs had gone I was Prescribed lyrica.   I take 300mg at night and 25mg in the morning.  It has been 5 weeks since I developed shingles and my face and scalp are still numb.  I have intermittent pain shocks.  I believe the lyrica is effective as I can't imagine what it would be like if I didn't take it.  I'm not sure how long I am suppose to take this but I imagine by other feedbacks that it could be months.,1st time shingles

It has been awful!! Shingles is the worst pain I have ever experienced and it isn't going away. I tried everything out there from Gabapentin to acupuncture, to percocet, to injections in my back and nothing helped, or it would help for a few weeks, but the pain always managed to come back strong. I was wary of Lyrica because of the side effects, but I finally decided to try it. It has definitely helped me and I can do things like ride my bike again with little pain. However, I have put on 8 lbs in 6 months and I am an extremely active person, so this is tough for me. I also have pain in my joints and sometimes my hands go numb, but less pain.",Cyclist 54

This is the worst experience of my life this nerve pain is tiring, depressing and just seems to not let up.  Lyrica is helping to cut down on the amount of spams and excruciating pain but, I keep wondering, ""when will it go away"" and why don't they give the shingles injections like chicken pox to ""prevent"".  Why do I have to wait to get this again someone where else or until I'm 50+ years old to prevent another bout of excruciating never pain.",Pain worse than labor

So was very reluctant to go back on it. I did give pregabalin a whirl and so far so good, I am supposed to be on 75mg 3 times a day, although due to my past experience will only take them at night so one 75mg, I am so surprised not any side effects like last time, although a weird sensation on my right cheek like a cool breeze feeling all the time, feels bizarre!",Rhiannone Sian
14,Pregabalin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,8.0,,"October 29, 2015",36,"Lyrica (pregabalin):I developed shingles in my face, scalp, and eye in 2005.  The initial pain was treated with gabapentin, which didn't work very well. The doc wouldn't prescribe anything stronger.  In fact, she hardly recognized that shingles pain was significant.My PHN kicked in when the rash disappeared.  I've still got it.I monitored the internet for PHN meds and when Lyrica came out I notified my new doc immediately.  He started me out at 100 mg three times a day and when that was only modestly effective he kicked it up to 150 mg X 3.  It works very nicely.  However there are side effects.  My weight gain has been significant.  Brain fog happens.  I get double vision on an irregular basis.  I feel tired.  Now my liver values are increasing.",hath5572

The Lyrica was/is a lifesaver, since I also have migraine, sinus, tension headaches. I seldom have the migraines anymore. My problem is that my scalp continues to get irritated if I comb it or use any kind of lotions, gels, moisturizers, oils or sprays on it.

16,Pregabalin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 15, 2015",32,Lyrica (pregabalin):I've copped a dose of the shingles from the middle of my back wrapped around into my belly button on the right side. Doctors couldn't work out the problem because the rash took 5 days to appear. The pain was very uncomfortable. Pain killers weren't cutting the mustard. When the rash appeared the Doc put me straight onto lyrica 75mg once a day. Had the pill before bed then for the next 3 days had a migraine so intense that all i could think of is please wear off and give me the shingles pain back. So lyrica did stop the nerve pain but i developed side effects. Just not for every one.,brendo

Within 3 days, I was in agony, after 8 weeks I was loosing functionality in the right leg.  Saw Orthopedist, Pain Specialist, and received the impression, that they thought I was a nut, or trying to get pain meds.Finally went to a neurologist, who diagnosed TPS and Shingles nerve pain interacting. Within 24 hours of starting Lyrica the pain lessened, upping the dose a few weeks later and the pain was zilch.  I have started to regain function in the right leg, it's very slow but I can see it.

One day it would be in my legs, then my torso, then my arm, my throat, my ear and then shingles surfaced on my torso-right side. I took an antiviral for the shingles, and Neurontin for pain.  The blisters were painful and they went away in a couple weeks but the pain remained and I took Neurontin in high doses, with Tylenol so I could sleep but my right leg hurt all the time.  I couldn't walk up/down stairs on that leg, or sleep on either of side without pain and I am a side sleeper so I was miserable.  A neurologist was skeptical that the cause was shingles but prescribed Lyrica and it was magic!  75 mg once a day and the pain is 95% gone, 6 months later still works.",lawnmowergirl

I experienced the typical symptoms: rash, burning pain, itching etc. After the scabs had dried I was put on Lyrica to ease the nerve pain. Have to say that it worked for me. I am a healthy 46 year old male. The side effects were some fuzziness and weight gain. This may have been due to lack of movement and also the Christmas eating but I put on 3 kilos in two weeks which is a lot for me. I am feeling that I would like to come off it so will reduce dosage and see what happens. At first I was nervous about taking this but it has notably reduced the pain to practically nothing.",charmingmanuk66

Had a severe attack of shingles on the face and scalp (3 weeks in most of the hair on one side of my head was literally gone). I refused morphine (in hindsight, I should have taken it) but I did take Percocet which helped the internal pain but not the nerve pain in the skin. For that they gave me Neurontin, but I could not tolerate it due to extreme drowsiness, loss of appetite, loss of concentration and dry mouth (before I could chew food it was too dry to swallow it). Tried Lyrica 75mg 3 times daily. First dose seemed to really work but effect declined significantly so that the fifth dose had no effect.  During the fourth week he increased to 100mg 3 times daily. Second dose helped then effects declined.",Medgeek

I originally took gabapentin (most effective) along with morphine to deal with the pain. I developed stomach problems from that mix so tried Lyrica as a replacement to the gabapentin. My stomach problems have subsided but the Lyrica does not seem to be as effective at relieving the nerve pain.
