My hands have some feeling, but only about 40%.  Hands hurt really bad.  Using Neurontin for 4 years.  Pain is almost gone.  I can flex my fingers.  I take a high dose as I also have chronic neck and back pain.  800 mg 3x a day.  I have had no side effects whatsoever.  Very safe and effective.",Ajay
2,Neurontin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 18, 2019",35,"I had an accident and broke my leg in half and had to be life flighted to Pittsburgh hospital.  I live in West Virginia. They wanted to amputate my leg but I said no and ended up with 15 surgeries and 20 pins. I am disabled due to it but I have my leg. The pain was the worst I have ever felt. I was on oxycontin  40 MG 3 x day with 30 MG oxycodone 8 x daily instant release tabs,with neurontin as well. But as I was wean down on pain meds I was left with neurontin. I have severe nerve damage to my whole leg. I'm on two 400 MG tabs 3 x daily. So 2400 MG total daily. I will be on for rest of my life. It is made my life so much better.  I can walk without pain but sleep is rough with nite terror for me. But short of that I would recommend it for nerve damage. It helps me function mentally as well. It's great!",Steamroller
3,Neurontin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 23, 2018",31,"I have been prescribed this drug twice for Trigeminal neuralgia .  4 years ago and I weighed 310 pounds.  I took this drug with seemingly no help.  The pain went away totally one day. No clue was given.It, ( the pain), has returned with a vengeance.  I am on a 600mg 3 times a day and cannot even talk without a painful shock to my face.  My face feels like the dentist hit a nerve in a tooth. Wind, water, a wrong touch and I am knocked to my knees, seriously.What is a better choice.  The pain has got to stop.",Michigan Mac
4,Neurontin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,10.0,,"September 30, 2016",39,Prescribed for nerve pain following shingles after crippling left hand side pain that did not respond to standard analgesia.two unexpected beneficial side effects have occurred.  My long term and almost permanent anxiety ( we are talking 35 years   ) has been greatly reduced. The problem that I had following a transient ischamic attack some five years prior where my bodies idea of the spacial position of my left leg via external stimulus did not agree with my visual perception and viewing my leg caused a strange spacial readjustment where the leg shifted four inches to the left but in reality stayed still. My visual acuity also improved as if everything was lit by stage lighting.,Anonymous

6,Neurontin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,1.0,,"April 15, 2016",80,"Have been on this for over a month and each increase by my doctor provides no relief whatsoever. The last increase has resulted in severe dizziness, light-headedness, memory loss and forgetfulness, fatigue, racing thoughts during sleep, inability to sleep more than a few hours, and most importantly, no effect on the severe pain from postherpetic neuralgia.  I will not be accepting another increase from the doctor, the side effects are intolerable, not to mention the side effects of weaning off this ineffective drug that I have yet to suffer.",nonname
7,Neurontin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,10.0,,"February 25, 2016",44,I experienced severe nerve pain following a second bout of shingles less than 3 months apart. During a 2 year period my doctors tried me on regular Gabapentin in combination with other medications - all with severe side effects and no relief from the constant pain and lack of a good night sleep.  I gained over 50 lbs as well.  My neurologist prescribed Horizant twice a day and my life changed almost over night!  I choose not to take it in combination with anything else other than 800 mg Ibuprofen when needed because concerns of past side effects. Eventhough my nerve pain has continued two years later and another bout of shingles I have been able to manage the pain with Horizant.,True Believer

After 6 weeks I find it does reduce pain to some extent and I am able to get a reasonable sleep. Side effects include ringing in ears and tingling in feet and hands, but I can put up with this. I was previously taking Lyrica but experienced very nasty side effects and had  to be weaned off it.",Stuart M
