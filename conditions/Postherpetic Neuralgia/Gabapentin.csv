0,Gabapentin,Postherpetic Neuralgia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 18, 2021",0,"I am a 74 year old woman and I got shingles in Feb. of 2021. Mine started as excruciating pain in my forehead, as if a horn was trying to push through my skull. Two trips to the ER before the lesions came out and I was diagnosed. I now have PHN and was initially given OxyContin, but while it helped minimally I was afraid of becoming addicted. I called my doctor again and asked to be put on something non-addictive. She prescribed gabapentin in 100 mg 3 times a day. No relief. She upped me to 300 MG 3 times a day. No relief. Finally I was put on 600 MG 4 times a day, so 2400 a day total. Finally I can say I'm pain free! My pain has changed to extreme itching now though, but the gabapentin takes care of that also. I've been on it for 11 months, and there doesn't seem to be an end in sight. But at least I can live normally with this miracle drug. The only minimal side effect is I get drowsy about a 1/2 hour after taking it, but nothing serious. Also occasional word lapse. Miracle drug!",June

Everybody is different on this drug, and if you are having side effects, and a doctor is telling you to keep taking it...I would either lower the dosage and or get a second opinion.  Too many drugs are given out at a dose that somebody said is the norm.  Well, we are each unique.  If you are ever uncomfortable or having bad side effects I would read up on the drug, and talk to you doc again, and....in the end, only you know exactly how you feel.  If side effects are not getting better, not going away, and they are interfering too much in your life, not the correct drug or dose for you.",Cindy

The problem that I had following a transient ischamic attack some five years prior where my bodies idea of the spacial position of my left leg via external stimulus did not agree with my visual perception and viewing my leg caused a strange spacial readjustment where the leg shifted four inches to the left but in reality stayed still.
