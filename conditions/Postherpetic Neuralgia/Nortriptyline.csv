I am now 44yrs. old and have had constant, localized pain and spider crawling feeling in the gall bladder area. Everything with me physically checked out fine. Prescribed the medication for the persistent pain/depression/anxiety, etc. Only take 10mg. at night, the pain and spider crawling has stopped but still experience the ears ringing.",roadrunnermullis5
