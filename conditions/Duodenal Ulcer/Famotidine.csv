0,Famotidine,Duodenal Ulcer,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2021",9,"I have a peptic ulcer and took Nexium. Causes horrible back pain, itching and horrific gas. Stopped taking and I was in pain all the time, nauseous, horrible acid in my throat, just awful. Saw our family gastroenterologist and he prescribed 40mg dose to me, two times per day for 6 weeks to heal the ulcer. After one hour of taking the pain went away, acid taste gone, was able to eat, and the nausea was gone. No side effects. Just felt very relaxed. After 4-6 weeks doctor will move me to as needed only after feeling so awful for 2 months, I am thankful for this medication.",Mich614
