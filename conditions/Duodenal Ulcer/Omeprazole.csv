0,Omeprazole,Duodenal Ulcer,1.0,,"September 6, 2021",16,"Prilosec (omeprazole):DO. NOT. TAKE. HORRIFYING. Took the pills against my better judgment for a nagging ulcer /gastritis per my doc, I usually prefer a holistic route. Mistake. 5 days in, an ER trip in an ambulance from sudden dizziness, painful pounding chest,  panic like I was dying, extreme sweating, numb hands and feet and pulse through the roof. Tests showed nothing but ended up back in the ER after night after night of undeniable horrific panic, sweating, extreme anxiety (I have never experienced anxiety or anything panic attack related before in my life), claustrophobic and anxiety ridden nervous thoughts that are unshakable. No sleep for days. With two toddlers it was torture. It could not have been anything but these awful pills obviously. I quit the pills, am seeing an acupuncturist and herbs to detox. Better but still a work in progress. Please do NOT risk your mental health over this poison. Not worth it one bit.",Marieski858
1,Omeprazole,Duodenal Ulcer,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 10, 2021",10,"this drug omeprazole is the best on the market by far !!!! It cured my ulcers within a month! But I was recommended to take them for my hernia which pushes acid back into my gut long term ! Then after 6 /12 month the joint pains started I could barely walk, The pain was in my feet, knees the lot! I wondered what was going on with my body then I read the reviews. I stopped taking the pills and after 3 months there is no pain in joints ! It is wonderful drug SHORT TERM please listen !!!!!",andy
2,Omeprazole,Duodenal Ulcer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 7, 2020",8,"I had slight burning pain in an area that my dr thought was an ulcer or gastritis. It was radiating a bit to my back. Dr prescribed omeprazole, 40 mg for a month, 20 mg for another month, 10 mg for the third month. Initially it seemed to help, but  I developed mild side effects that kept getting worse- flatulence, slight nausea, loss of appetite, tightness at bottom of rib cage, jitteriness, intermittent loose bowels and constipation, malaise, fatigue, increase in heart beat upon moving, and toward the end, brain fog. I still had slight burning intermittently in the duodenum area. I’d planned to go off it soon anyway, but two days ago I realized that my life had become a misery and maybe it was the drug that was causing it! I’ve been off it for two days and I have improvement so far. if I had it to do over again I absolutely would not take it for more than a month. Ridiculous drug.",spk
3,Omeprazole,Duodenal Ulcer,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 4, 2020",14,"I’m gonna give this 3 stars solely because it does help with ulcer/reflux pain. But the side effects are crazy. I’m typically not one to ever experience side effects from medication but this one was a totally different story. I had pins and needles in my hands and feet constantly, weird sensations all over my body, headaches, dizziness, terrible anxiety, stomach cramps. I literally have a neurologist appointment this month because I had convinced myself I had MS. I’ve been off of it for 5 days now and today is the first day I can somewhat confidently say that I feel a little better. All of this started the day after I began omeprazole.",Case
4,Omeprazole,Duodenal Ulcer,8.0,,"December 8, 2011",16,Prilosec (omeprazole):Prilosec replaced a treatment that consisted of 800 mg Cimetidine about a week ago and seems to be doing the trick nicely.,Anonymous
5,Omeprazole,Duodenal Ulcer,9.0,,"September 17, 2008",19,"Been using omeprazole for 2 years as effective maintenance therapy against duodenal ulcer recurrence, probably linked to Crohn's disease. Found that I could cut dosage from 20 mg to 10 mg daily in periods when disease was passive. Little evidence of side effects - merely occasional slight light headedness.",Edenderry
