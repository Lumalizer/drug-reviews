0,Prilosec,Duodenal Ulcer,1,,"September 6, 2021",16,"DO. NOT. TAKE. HORRIFYING. Took the pills against my better judgment for a nagging ulcer /gastritis per my doc, I usually prefer a holistic route. Mistake. 5 days in, an ER trip in an ambulance from sudden dizziness, painful pounding chest,  panic like I was dying, extreme sweating, numb hands and feet and pulse through the roof. Tests showed nothing but ended up back in the ER after night after night of undeniable horrific panic, sweating, extreme anxiety (I have never experienced anxiety or anything panic attack related before in my life), claustrophobic and anxiety ridden nervous thoughts that are unshakable. No sleep for days. With two toddlers it was torture. It could not have been anything but these awful pills obviously. I quit the pills, am seeing an acupuncturist and herbs to detox. Better but still a work in progress. Please do NOT risk your mental health over this poison. Not worth it one bit.",Marieski858
