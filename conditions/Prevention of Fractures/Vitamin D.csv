1,Vitamin D,Prevention of Fractures,10,,"April 11, 2018",47,Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol):I would like to add that you need to take sufficient magnesium along with the vitamin d in order to avoid the side effects of cramping and pain . The lysinate form is a good form of magnesium to take to avoid laxative effects of other forms.  You need to take magnesium in order for vitamin d to work well.  Good luck.,Nicky
