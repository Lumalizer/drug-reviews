0,Colchicine,Gout Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 16, 2021",0,"Don't bother I took colchicine a few days and all I got was a gut ache, diarrhoea and come with a risk of your hair thinning and at my age it would probably stay like that. Gout is no better so I am getting these changed to another med but there is virtually no choice, you either take Prednisone steroids which makes you fat and depressed or you take NSAIDS unless they give you prescription strength you can buy them yourself over the counter. So I believe you are on your own with Gout .",Marky

4,Colchicine,Gout Prophylaxis,7,,"March 5, 2013",13,had 2 bouts in left big toe. Second one was so bad couldn't use clutch in car or change geers on bike. On a bad day I considered a chisel and malet but about a week after starting colchicine I woke to find pain reduced by 50% and within about 3 weeks 95% so well pleased and no apparent symptoms.,nigeldl
