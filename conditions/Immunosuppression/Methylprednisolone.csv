1,Methylprednisolone,Immunosuppression,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 21, 2017",6,"Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone):I have had repeated Solu-medrol success use for  Systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE). If given enough the first time, it doesn't need to be repeated and I can have had remissions lasting for 18 months to over 2 years living a normal, productive life.   The drug is not used enough for this disease unless SLE is life threatening.  This drug should be used more to prevent life threatening SLE issues.",SLE-Rx

I had a form of skin rash caused by swimming in chlorinated pools, I might add a very painful and itchy rash over 50% of my body. At 66 years of age this is news to me I have been swimming in chlorinate pools all my live. The drug methylprednisolone was prescribe and the outcome was almost unbelievable. The itching stop the very first day and the rash disappeared in a week. Unfortunately my swimming in chlorinated pools days are over. My body just can't take any more.",Mr Flash
3,Methylprednisolone,Immunosuppression,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 16, 2015",4,"Currently taking 16mg of Medrol once a day as part of undergoing IVF, although I've taken it in the past at smaller doses to help with my chronic, moderately-severe asthma, which worsens in winter.  While I love prednisone for what it does in helping me breathe (and hopefully in successfully helping me achieve motherhood), I hate its side effects.  For me, the biggest problem is the anxiety (though weight gain isn't fun).  I already have an underlying anxiety disorder, but taking this, especially in higher doses makes me feel truly ""crazy.""  Panic at unbearable levels, insomnia, sweaty, clammy hands and feet, racing heart, irrational/inconsolable....the whole nine yards.  I use it strictly as a last (or only) resort and not without caution.",LadyZantac
