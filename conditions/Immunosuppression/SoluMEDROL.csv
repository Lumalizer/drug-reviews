0,SoluMEDROL,Immunosuppression,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 21, 2017",6,"I have had repeated Solu-medrol success use for  Systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE). If given enough the first time, it doesn't need to be repeated and I can have had remissions lasting for 18 months to over 2 years living a normal, productive life.   The drug is not used enough for this disease unless SLE is life threatening.  This drug should be used more to prevent life threatening SLE issues.",SLE-Rx
