1,Escitalopram,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 31, 2022",0,"Turned me into a shell of my former self. Lost all motivation, actually gained more social anxiety, the dreams you get are also just too much; not to mention the absolute brain fog you have everyday. I also continued to have worsening panic attacks. Maybe the drug wasn’t for me, and I should’ve been treated with more of something that helps with my panic disorder, but the effects it had on my brain and body the 6 months I took it (and the incessant nature of my doctor telling me to continue taking it because it’ll eventually work) caused me to switch doctors and taper off of it on my own. I’ve been off of it for about 2 months now, and I can still feel lasting effects, but this drug truly did nothing but harm my lifestyle and everything about me as a person. Like I said at the start, while I was on this drug I was literally a Shell of My Former Self.",AntiPsychiatry

Sometimes all night. I also suffered anxiety with constant overthinking, total loss of appetite.I started on 10mg.  The first two weeks it made my anxiety and panic worse, I almost stopped taking it as could not bear it.  I pushed through and WOW am I glad I did.

3,Escitalopram,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 24, 2022",2,"I have been on Lexapro previously, I have restarted 2 weeks ago. I suffer from GAD, intrusive thoughts and panic attacks. I can’t tell you how much this medication has helped me. The first few days, my anxiety was worse. I do recommend using something like Clonazepam. Before I restarted, my anxiety got so bad, from the moment I work up, my heart was racing. I felt like I had butterflies in my stomach. I was just getting to the point that working was becoming challenging. I would look forward to the end of the day so I could just sleep and have a break. I was terrified I would never feel better. Thinking I couldn’t go on this way anymore. I would think about things I would have to do in the coming months and I was terrified, everything felt so difficult. After 5 days on he medication, I started getting these moments of clarity. I’m now completely back to normal- I feel joy! Hang in there, you will get relief. Praying for you all.",Kam
4,Escitalopram,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 23, 2022",0,"Being honest my mental health has been in decline a long time, basically throughout pandemic and a lifetime of being able to try and live with crippling anxiety. I got back to UK from being in foreign Country. My anxiety it was work related and led to a major increase in anxiety, self harm, loss of job and sent home. On return I was prescribed Vencarm XL 225mg which was not in any was effective for me. My anxiety went through roof. I started Escitalopram last week at 5mg. I was drinking alcohol, bad idea, and begging for Xanax to curb anxiety, to no avail. I had no alcohol today, second day. Doctor had prescribed 28 Escitalopram 10mg which I had to face the outside world to go and fetch. I will not over dramatise my anxiety at thought of leaving my room as you will know. However, I faced it and was shaking, but on interaction with someone else the crazy feelings went a little and went more as I got to fresh air. In short, Escitalopram appears to working for me; however, it is still early days.",Will

My anxiety before was just getting progressively worse to the point I was experiencing physical symptoms that I would wind myself up into thinking I had something else wrong with me! I was not sleeping, I didn’t want to be on my own but then when I had company I wanted to be on my own, my relationships were suffering as I was just constantly in flight or fight mode. I was never depressed just anxious over trivial things or things that hadn’t even happened yet! The first week of taking 10mg were a little rough.. my anxiety was heightened, I had a funny tummy and felt a bit nauseous and lost my appetite but after that each week just got better and better. My head is finally clear and my relationships with my family and partner are healthier.

I have suffered with anxiety since childhood but never knew what it was till my twenties. By the time I was 27 I was virtually an agoraphobic that was afraid to go anywhere and had panic attacks atthe grocery store and at my job, it was debilitating. When my ex and I split and I moved into my apartment I was a mess, I could literally not eat or sleep and never left my house. It got so bad that I told my mother I thought I would either commit myself into a hospital or kill myself. She talked me into seeing my doc. He prescribed me 5mg of lexapro and I had my mom stay the night in case I had a bad reaction. Within a week I felt much better and my only side effect was that I was sleepy in the morning. Within the year of this drug I have become a completely different person. I have no anxiety and I don’t worry about anything. I run every morning, I got a new job and a new relationship!

13,Escitalopram,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 1, 2022",9,"Lexapro (escitalopram):For nearly a decade I was terrified to try any kind of psychiatric medication. I was afraid it would change my personality, turn me into a zombie, make me go crazy, you name it. 3 years ago I finally tried Lexapro for my OCD and anxiety and it has changed my life so drastically. I should start by saying I also went to therapy and that helped tremendously, but I went from being someone who was afraid to drink tap water, had terrible agoraphobia, and weekly panic attacks, to being almost entirely anxiety free. The only side effects I've experienced are slight decrease in sex drive and slight flattening if highs and lows in my mood. I slowly went from 2.5 mg to 5 to 7.5 and now I take 10mg daily",Sarah

I am already so much more easygoing and feel like I am coming back into myself more every day, so I am excited to see where I will be at in a few more weeks. The first 10 days was pretty rubbish, I felt completely exhausted and had issues with my sleep but like I say I'm slowly coming back to life and am really glad I stuck with the 10mg my GP prescribed me. Take it from someone who was really hesitant to take the medication - just try it because it could end up working for you and if you are reading this review now like I was a few weeks ago you probably have exhausted all other methods for getting some relief from anxiety anyway. Give it a go, you may feel crap already so why not try and see.",Anonymous

I tried all kinds of natural remedies to help with my anxiety and depression and nothing was helping. I felt so hopeless and would cry praying every day to feel better and nothing was cutting it. I went to several different doctors hoping I was wrong and I didn’t need the medication till I spoke to a new doctor who treated me like a friend and not a patient. I was so lost didn’t want to work and when I did go I wanted to leave and not be around anyone. Some days were better then others, when I had that anxious feeling that would not go away and I just felt as if something bad was going to happen. I said I needed to do something about it. I cried and decided to take the lexapro. The first few days were a bit hard I felt jittery nervous but kept on going. About a week into taking the pill I started to notice the difference.

Had a health scare & my anxiety got really bad. Started on 10 & after learning I needed surgery went up to 20. I also take Klonopin. After surgery I went back to 10mg. Last few weeks family drama triggered panic & anxiety. Went back up to 20. I reduced my Klonopin to .25 at night since .5 with 20mg of Lexapro made me tired in the morning. Feeling so much better. Can talk myself out of anxious thoughts, not on the verge of tears anymore, I have energy to do things. I have had crippling anxiety for decades. It’s stolen so much from me. This medication has made a big difference. I know anxiety can make you feel hopeless & helpless but don’t give up!!! It’s so nice to look forward to the start of a new day when the alarm goes off instead of dreading what my mind might put me thru. When 1st starting Lexapro it made my anxiety worse but that passes.

I took 2.5 then increased to 5, then after a couple months increased to 10 mg and have been taking it for 8 months.  First taking it, my side effects were just tiredness, not any nausea which is what I was afraid of - but more just not ""feeling"" hungry, but I would just remind myself to eat. At first it felt like it made no change because it was gradual, but I realized over the months that I have been in the best mental state I have EVER been in. My panic attacks, diarrhea everyday, constant dissociation, constant shallow breathing, has lessened so much. Less crying and mental breakdowns every other week. It is such a relief.

I just tapered off the lexapro and now giving Zoloft a try. My doc also added lamotrigine for the depression. This is just my experience, so please please don’t let others experience with a medication keep you from taking it. While lexapro didn’t work for me, it might be a miracle for someone else.

I have been on Escitalopram 5 mg for 1.5 years.My basic anxiety and depression needed some treatment and at the same time I had fought with psoriatic arthritis which is a degenerative disease. I was given Methotrexate but I did not want that dangerous drug. Having learned how escitalopram works well as an anti-inflammatory I gave it a chance. Wow!  I could go normally again, I could dance- right after 3 weeks use! My anxiety is reduced, too and I am well balanced.  I suppose it is a very good medicine. I do not have any side effect!

One of the  good effects is sound sleeping, which in turn gives me good results the next day coping with task and social interaction.  This has worked very good for me over the years, but our health plan changed and I am now getting meds from the U.S. Air Force pharmacy.  There seems to be a difference, and wondering if anyone else has experienced a change since taking their generic pills.  Albertsons / SAVON pills were white  round pills, whereas the Air Force has oval shaped salmon or pink pills marked SG on one side, and 153 on the other side.  I sleep well, but now have a lower frustration level and somewhat of an anger feeling sometimes.  Reaching out to see if the Air Force generic is not a LEXAPRO kind of pill.  Something is not right.

26,Escitalopram,Anxiety,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 2, 2022",2,"Lexapro (escitalopram):Started on Sertraline and moved onto this, too quickly probably, having not given the former a proper chance. Six months in and I feel the benefit and real relief from a lifelong condition. The one piece of advice is to give these meds a chance, results simply don't come overnight. It's only when several weeks, or months, have elapsed do you realise that an improvement has taken place. I would counsel against anything other than small amounts of alcohol, particularly in the first few weeks. It's not particularly down to interactions (it wasn't in my case anyway) it's just that alcohol just wipes out the gains that you get from these medications,In terms of side effects, yes there are some, but they do seem to pass (4-6 weeks) and for me at least, it's a trade off between those and the continued impact of anxiety. One needs to make up one's own mind on this. 10mg for me at the moment.",PJM

My lexapro (generic) was increased to 15mg two weeks ago and I actually feel like it has made my depression slightly worse with minimal improvement on the anxiety. My doctor just prescribed rexulti as an add on to the lexapro as it can help with resistant depression. I am also going to ask if I can go back down to the 10mg lexapro as I feel that helped a little more than the 15mg. Since starting the 15mg I’ve noticed more intrusive thoughts and a feeling that I quite can’t shake. Now with all this being said, this is just my experience.

Prescribed 10mg lexapro for social anxiety and a fear of panicking in social situations. My anxiety became all consuming - I'd tried CBT, have been in psychotherapy for a long time, meditation etc. Medication was my last resort and I was really hesitant to start this as I didn't know if my anxiety was 'that bad' or if I could handle my own internalised stigma about being 'someone on meds'. Well, that's me now, and as soon as I started it I haven't looked back. SO glad I tried them, it took about 8 weeks for me to feel anything different, but once I did it just helped me to feel myself, balanced, not stressing about small things. I have my social life back. I had no side effects (apart from it taking slightly longer to orgasm) but even this has pretty much gone.

Lexapro didn’t do anything for me. It made me feel like a zombie and I couldn’t cry when I wanted to or feel normal emotion.

I had constant obsessional and morbid thoughts, and was waking up feeling terrible dread every morning. I had taken escitalopram previously a number of years ago for depression and remembered it had been a positive experience.I have been taking 5mg daily for around 3 months now and feel huge benefits. I would say however that my sleep is shallower and I dream more but I have stopped waking up feeling panic, sadness or a sense of dread. I now feel far calmer and obsessional, anxious thoughts melt away if they do arise. Side effects have not been significant for me fortunately. Having tried a number of other medications I would say escitalopram has been one of the most benign.

I experienced both anxiety & panic attacks at a greater frequency compared to prior to starting. Despite this, I have continued to take the medication with the hope that this side effect would lessen, despite most of my thoughts begging me to stop this medication. After about 12 days, I felt my body adjusting to the dosage. The last two days I have felt really great, no anxiety or racing heart rate (another initial side effect), no panic attacks and improved mood and enjoyment in things. I wanted to share just in case others are experiencing initial worsening anxiety and are unsure if this improves over time. Although my one experience is anecdotal, I am glad I stuck with it. I experienced headaches, nausea, jitteriness and trouble sleeping the first week as well, those too have gone away. My appetite has improved, and have had no complication with sexual dysfunction.

We agreed to start progressively, first 2.5 mg, then 5 mg etc. In the first 2 weeks I felt slightly weird, but nothing spectacular. Also, I started feeling from the first days a small resistance against developing a panic attack in typical situations. Today, I can say that the past 3 months with this medicine have been the most impressive improvement that I ever felt in my battle against anxiety. I feel almost like a 'normal person'!

Well, that all hit the fan after quarantining, having a tough breakup, and just feeling hopeless. I finally began experiencing physical pain from my anxiety and depression along with a racing heart and thoughts at night. I went to a few doctors and they all told me it was likely caused by anxiety and one of them prescribed me 10mg if lexapro daily. I looked at the bottle for weeks before deciding to take it. I felt like a failure for taking antidepressants, but within a few weeks, I couldn't believe, I was my natural happy self again. It didn't make me euphoric at all, only my true optimistic, laughing self again...the best part of me. I'm now in week 6ish or 7 I believe and I feel amazing.

I found out that the right dosage for me is 20mg (I’m a 23 year old and fit woman). Throughout the years, thanks to therapy, I learnt how to cope with anxiety and panic attacks, anyways one symptom that would never leave me and I could never learn how to cope with was air hunger/ breathlessness/ hyperventilation/ whatever. I had this symptom from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed: I was okay only when I was sleeping, and I thought I was going crazy and was insane. Started lexapro again after this symptom worsened, and as I said I started it for the third time in 5 years, and I can happily say that after 37 days (yes, I kept a journal) I am finally feeling like myself again.

For the first time in ages I have felt my shoulders drop, my brain fog start to clear and have enjoyed a couple of social interactions. I only wish I had started this medication sooner. For anyone living with anxiety and starting on this medication, I wish you the same results or better that I have experienced. Thank you to everyone for sharing their experiences, it gave me hope and hope is a medicine in itself.",New to medication

I did research and people were saying that it usually takes a month or so to start working. And it can make symptoms worse in the meantime. This really scared me. But after talking with some other people that use it I decided to give it another go. But this time I started on half a tablet (5mg). I could sleep thankfully. It did give me strange feelings for the first week. Not that my condition got worse, but I just felt a little off.

I dropped 3 of my 4 classes, stopped going to the gym, and even stopped working for a couple weeks. I was having panic attacks daily. I decided I needed to take a step in the right direction. So, I started taking this medication. The first week for me was awful, side effects were rough and even increased anxiety. Week 2 was better and week 3 feels decent.

I could hardly sleep, struggled to eat & lost almost a stone. I was very close to a complete nervous breakdown. My GP initially tried Sertraline. This helped about 50%, but I still wasn’t okay, even at 200mg. I then  switched to Escitalopram. I had a hard time during the switch (increased anxiety, low mood, suicidal thoughts) but within a couple of weeks it was definitely working. I started on 10mg, increased to 15mg (similar increase in anxiety etc initially) now up to 20mg. I feel 95% myself again, consistently. Even though I was having therapy & support from friends & family, I don’t feel I could have recovered without this medication.

I’m one of those people who didn’t want to take medication and tried everything else homeopathic, but in the end, I needed more. It does take patience because it does take weeks to kick in.

239,Escitalopram,Anxiety,9.0,,"December 8, 2020",18,"When I was prescribed this medication escitalopram (for panic attacks, agoraphobia and mild depression) I was sceptical, partly because of all the negative and sometimes scary reviews on here. Eventually, I was desperate so I tried it, expecting to suffer the first couple of weeks and have to take time off work and study. Not at all! First 2 weeks (5mg) were fantastic, I did lose my appetite a bit and sometimes feel light-headed but benefits were obvious from the first morning. I finally had energy and smiling didn't feel like a chore. My fatigue and nausea were greatly reduced.Now that I've been on escitalopram for a while (10mg), I have fatigue again however reduced mood swings, anxiety and I can concentrate a little better. Yet to be exposed triggers to test if it will stop panic attacks.If you are prescribed this medication don't be scared.

I then started taking 5mg, and all those good feelings have now diminished. I’m feeling dizzy, nauseous, anxious, heart race, loss of appetite, tired. To be honest, I feel a little depressed.

Xanax was the only magic pill that calmed my anxious stomach mind connection but its not ideal long term so I tried Escitalopram. The beginning is not pleasant and the drug caused more stomach upset initially. 4 months later on 20mg I feel a lot better. My anxiety has reduced a lot and my stomach is better. It is giving me space to heal that troublesome mind gut connection. Also side note anxiety usually causes you to produce less stomach acid and not more stomach acid. The symptoms are the same but the treatment is different. Doctor readily hand out acid suppressing drugs but usually what you need is more stomach acid. HCI supplements really helped me along with digestive enzymes supplements and fermented foods. Also cutting out alcohol, chocolate, coffee and other irritants.",mrIsaac

I was better with handling situations at work and at home. Unfortunately the downside for me was I ended up gaining 15lbs within 5 months. It definitely slowed down my metabolism. It was easy to gain and no matter how much healthier I tried to eat I could not lose the weight. I have been slender my whole life so this was making me feel so depressed about the way I looked.

Had a chest x-ray, spirometry and bloods done to make sure there was nothing sinister and then put on Zoloft 50 mg, which I think may have been too much too quick, and this caused me to go into a near manic, panicked and upset state for about two weeks until I went back to the doctor and said that zoloft had taken a breathing anxiety condition to a crying, manic and nearly considering admitting myself state.

I had been suffering with anxiety for nearly a year but managed to get by and it was bearable. All of a sudden I wasn’t sleeping a wink at night, having panic attacks 24/7 and thought I was going crazy! The lack of sleep made me depressed. Was put on Escitalopram and clonazipam to cover the initial side effects for two weeks. The first few weeks were real tough, started on 5mg and after a week up to 10mg. I had increased anxiety, extreme tiredness, could sleep all day, nausea and diarrhoea, terrible night sweats and headaches. Took 4 weeks to start working for me. And 3 weeks for the side effects to subside. Stick with it! All the side effects go away after time. No longer anxious, sleeping better and feeling myself again. It’s amazing!",Lupie

It took about 2 weeks for me to feel a difference, and I was blown away by how different my life was. I was going to concerts, traveling, doing things I never thought I would be able to do with my level of anxiety. I switched off Lexapro to try a new drug recently to see if it would work better, but it made my anxiety worse than ever. Thankfully I started Lexapro again last week and I already feel so much better. This drug honestly saved my life and even though everyone is different, I would completely recommend trying it if you have GAD. The side effects (for me) were mild, only some insomnia and a little dizziness, so I would say if your starting it to wait a week or so, and you’ll feel a difference. I hope my review helps!",Sb144

It won't ""fix"" you, but it'll make it so you can actually breathe again. I used to cry constantly, isolate myself, have panic attacks so frequently I couldn't even sleep, and have horrible intrusive violent thoughts. 1. be proactive when it comes to the nausea side effect. Eat BEFORE you take the pill, and don't let yourself get hungry during the first 3-4 hours after you take the pill. Because once you get nausea it becomes harder to eat, which only makes you more nauseous. It's a vicious cycle that can be prevented.2. ignore the negative reviews that are like ""I took this pill for 1 day and it caused *terrifying side effects*."" They only cause more anxiety and they're highly unlikely. 3. From my personal experience, the first things to get better were the physical symptoms of anxiety. Less panic attacks, more hungry, less crying, etc. Keeping a journal is helpful to see the progression.",snazzycat

I honestly felt more calm the first night I took it. The next day I just felt kinda foggy and tired. I am on day 4. It makes me nauseous, a little dizzy sometimes if I get up to fast, and it has given me gas, as well as feeling a little more anxious during the day at time. I take it at night around 9.

Before this medication, my OCD/BDD rituals and thoughts were consuming anywhere from 3-10 hours of my day. Since week 2 of this medication, the thoughts and rituals have been less and less. I'm on week 5, and I feel like it's helping more and more each day with anxious, obsessive thoughts and the down moods. I pray this medication continues to work for me, because I finally feel like I can be something and accomplish what I've always wanted for myself. I'm so grateful for this medication, and the very few side effects I experienced starting this drug (mild headaches, slight dizziness, and dry mouth).

When I talked to my doctor about my mental health before he prescribed this I was a lot more anxious than depressed. As I started taking it, it helped a lot. Not only I noticed a difference, but everyone around me also did, saying how much more outgoing I was, and I was. It helped with my anxiety and my depression wasn’t a big issue, but as I continued to take it, my depression slowly got worse and worse. I eventually stopped going to school and missed like 3 months worth of classes, being in college this was terrible, considering most classes only allow 3-5 absences for an entire semester. Needless to say, my grades went downhill causing me to fall deeper into my depression and never leave my house. Eventually I stopped taking it and while I’m still depressed and anxious, it’s not as bad as the Lexapro made it. So I’d say for anxiety, it was a great medication, but depression wise it was absolutely terrible.",km

I took a nap and the weakness kept coming and going in waves. It was really bad to the point that at times I was thinking if I would faint and have to be taken to the ER. The last time I felt the weakness was this morning around 12 and have been better since (probably cause it's leaving my system). I read about people having side effects but nothing like the one I was having. I'm supposed to start my period in a couple of days and so was wondering if that contributed to the weakness as well. Might give it another try in a couple weeks, but for now I'm not taking it for sure.",Ai

I couldn’t believe this was happening to me, I had no idea what was happening to me! I was put on lexapro 10mg and it is currently my 8th week on it. I feel a lot better; I feel like myself again. The first few weeks were a little brutal, and the next few weeks after I had my handful of bad days/moments, but it DOES get better.

First and foremost EVERYONE is different, so everyone will react to it differently. I was prescribed it by my primary Doctor due to my severe anxiety and mild depression. Before this medication I was prescribed Celexa, but hated it. My anxiety and depression got so much worse I decided to do something about it. It came to the point where my anxiety and depression affected everyone around me and I just wasn't happy anymore.  At first taking this medication gave me some side affects. My side effects were really dry mouth, some intense dreams, and some loss of appetite. The only thing that has stuck for these few months have been the dreams. They seems SO REAL! But I can say I rather have some dreams than those scary anxiety attacks I use to get, and those depressed bed sobs. Lexapro has changed my life! Before this medication my life was hitting rock bottom. My Anxiety was so severe it took over my life. I obsessed over everything, overthought everything, felt like at any moment I was going to die. I was on edge every second. My blood pressure was always high and I'm only 24! I had this obsession of dying in a car accident, it came to a point I couldnt ride in a car with anyone else unless I was driving. If I did I would get panic attacks.

Was never going to be happy in a relationship, or in my job, or even be able to hug my own mother again.

The first week you will feel tired, dizzy, and mildly nauseated. Those effects disappear very quickly.  Do start at 5mg and slowly increase to 10 or 20mg. Ask you doctor to supplement with Buspar XL which counteracts most Lexapro side effects and further helps control anxiety and panic attacks. I don't recommend using Lexapro without Buspar.

I am very thankful for Lexapro.  I am so glad that I made it trough the first few weeks with the side effects.  This drug changed my life.",Anonymous

It took about three months for me to feel like my old self again. I have no side effects, and I haven't had a panic attack in three years since I began taking it. Life is great thanks to Lexapro.",Anonymous

1411,Escitalopram,Anxiety,7.0,,"April 4, 2008",47,"Lexapro (escitalopram):My son is 8yrs old and has asperger's with an emphasis in anxiety. When the doc prescribed Lexapro at 10mg he had a manic episode, but when decreased to 5mg MY SON SMILED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 2YRS! For a mom there is no greater feeling. We have to occationally use an additional anxiety medicine durning periods of intense stress but for maintenance therapy it's great. I only gave it a rating of 7 due to the severe WEIGHT GAIN he has experienced. Good luck to all who suffer",claire bear

I have been on every anti-depressent and anti-anxiety med known along with mood stabilizers. All of these at the same time and always tweaking doses. I had no life I just wanted to be alone from my wife and kids and people in general. This hurt that I was not able to be the dad and husband I used to be. I have been on Lexapro for 4 weeks now and for the first time I have no anxiety or depression. It works for me",THX

Now,after being severely & permanently injured at work,having spinal surgery 2 years ago, he has severe anxiety,with good reason! & his doctors have put him on Valium, then Ativan, & then Klonapin.  But recently, a new doctor asked him to try Lexapro. Boy what a wonder drug so far!! Very few side-effects,and it really gets him focused and happier!! If it continues,it will be a miracle for our family!!!!!!",KRONIC

Mild nausea for the first couple days of treatment, fine after that. No other notable effects until going from 30 to 40, now noticed a somewhat decreased sex drive and some difficulty orgasming. Still deciding whether that's worth it.Otherwise, Lexapro is decent. No fabulous turnaround for me, but definitely helping me get on with life :-)",lockelove
