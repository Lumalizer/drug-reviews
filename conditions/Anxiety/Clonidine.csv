0,Clonidine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2022",1,"I have food sensitivities (MSG, Paprika, Peppers, Potatoes, Yellow and Red food colorings) that trigger anxiety, racing brain, difficulties sleeping, and high blood pressure. My son has taken clonidine for 10+ years for his ADHD, helps him sleep after taking high doses Adderall during the daytime. So I asked my doctor to let me try it. I took it yesterday evening and had the most amazing nights sleep with vivid dreams and just felt well rested when I woke up. I have felt very calm and at peace today. This is just my first day on it, but wanted to share that it was a positive experience with absolutely no negative side effects. I'm 6'4 and 250lbs and started with .1mg and will increase as needed.",James H.

3,Clonidine,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 7, 2021",2,"I take it and it has a mild effect on my anxiety. I still have to take antidepressants but I think my major reason for my anxiety is ADHD. Btw, I have tachycardia as well so I have to take a beta-blocker but I do believe it is related to my racing thoughts from ADHD. It is a shame my doctor took me off Adderall when it worked wonders. He figured alternative non-addictive meds are better but they are not. I bet many people here who suffer from severe anxiety with racing thoughts could have ADHD and should talk to their doctors about it.",john316
4,Clonidine,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 19, 2021",1,"Just started this stuff recently and love it.  Sleep like a baby.  Hits way different than benzos or propranolol for me personally.  I absolutely love benzos but thats not a long term route I want to go.  Didn't like  propranolol.  A full pill at night will tranquilize you for twelve hours (feels similar to strong Benadryl at that dose).  A 1/2-1/4 a pill during the day has been a very effective anxiety aid.  I drink coffee with it.  Little upper, little downer.  Great for ADD and anxiety.  Depression being treated with other stuff. 9/10.  10/10 would be xanax/kpin but this is way safer.",randoguy
5,Clonidine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 14, 2021",2,I was taking it for almost 4 years. I stopped cuz I was tired of depending on the drug. I was without it for 3 months I was driving and smoking weed like crazy until I had an episode of breaking things with a bat.  I was put on it again and I am slowly going back to normal thanks to that drug . I went 3 weeks with no sleep until a few days ago. Reading all of this testimonials I don't feel alone,Anonymous

8,Clonidine,Anxiety,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2021",3,"I was prescribed Chlonidine (.01 mg) daily for anxiety, ADD, facial tics and OCD. It works fairly fast, however it makes me extremely tired, and the dry mouth is very bothersome. It definitely lowers your heart rate which, in my case, makes me sleepy.

I’ve taken it twice a day for two days, and now I feel hollow and weak. I feel like I’m not fully conscious, and my anxiety levels are much higher than before taking this medication.  I’m at a point in the detox process where anxiety should be going away, so this pill is a very unpleasant surprise.  It was effective at lowering blood pressure until the anxiety took over.",...
10,Clonidine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 18, 2021",10,"I've never reviewed a med but I have to say right from the first dose, this helped my anxiety immense. It felt almost like a longer lasting, clearer version of a benzo. It definitely made me sleepy, but it also kept me feeling calm and present. The best way I can describe it is like all the hyperstimulation I experience settled down, and I had a feeling similar to how you'd feel after getting an awesome massage, just completely relaxed and blissful.

I am in recovery from drugs & alcohol and cannot take any mood altering substances. I took meds like buspar & visraril previously for anxiety & they did nothing. I also have bipolar II disorder (rapid cycling) & I've noticed that when I'm in my depressive episodes, clonidine helps my mood too. I don't know how that works but it does. I was sensitive to clonidine when I first began taking it and I would go to sleep. I only take it 3-7 days (1x/day) per month but my body is used to it now and I do not get drowsy. I am also pregnant but I'm ok to take it.",J
14,Clonidine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 5, 2021",37,"I have Hypertension, ADD, and anxiety, the majority of the things that Clonidine is used for.  I was so happy when I was finally put on it.  I take .1 mg 3x a day and soon they are going to raise my dosage.  It is a miracle drug, it does great for my BP and my anxiety I will say though it does not help my ADD so I am still on Adderrall for that.I do want to address something with those that are on it strictly for anxiety and who are having issues, this medication will lower your BP so if you anxiety is getting worse or you are extremely tired and possibly feeling faint, you are taking too much and your BP is more that likely to low.  Try taking a smaller dosage, taking more would make it worse.  For those that are saying it works but wears off and are taking the .1 mg talk to your Dr. because that is the smallest dosage and it can be raised.",Butterfly0fJune
15,Clonidine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 4, 2021",26,Worst medicine ever! I’m so mad that this was even prescribed to me for anxiety because it’s only made my anxiety 100 percent worse. I had no idea this medication was used to treat ADHD as my doctor told me it was used to treat high blood pressure which I have never had. She misled me and increased my dosage to .3 mg a day before I figured out what was making me crazy.,JJ
16,Clonidine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 24, 2020",13,"Years ago, I had a mini-stroke, also known as a TIA. After I had tried countless different medications, I agreed to try Clonidine. In addition to my chronic hypertension, I also have PTSD. This medication GREATLY helped with panic attacks; I would be calm in 10 minutes. It's sad that a hypertensive emergency can so easily happen if you abruptly adjust the dose or quit it cold turkey, because otherwise I'd still be on it. It works as good as Ativan or Xanax, and is far faster... but the risk if you forgot to take it, personally for me, outweighs the benefits.",Katluv
17,Clonidine,Anxiety,10.0,,"December 10, 2020",41,"My doctor prescribed 0.1 mg (smallest dose) for anxiety, irritability and anger. It was just what I needed, although I had to cut in half as the full dose was a bit too sedating. It really mellowed me out and helped me relax. Way better than the benzo I have been resorting to. I wish I had discovered this medication sooner as I have been suffering for a long time. I recommend starting with 1/2 and even a 1/4 to see how you feel. You'll need a pill cutter. Best of luck!",Anne
18,Clonidine,Anxiety,10.0,,"November 25, 2020",14,"I am going through withdrawals to get off Methadone for back pain, and I was experiencing severe anxiety and panic attacks.  I had to get off it because it caused severe constipation like I’ve never experienced in my life and was very painful.  I sent my doctor a text on Saturday after 3 days of mental disorders from the withdrawals and asked him for a prescription of Clonidine, which he called in to CVS immediately.  I’ve never experienced anxiety and panic attacks like that before, and I have been through several withdrawals while detoxing off opiates in the past, which I started taking after two invasive back surgeries in January 1998 and October 2000.  Today is Day #4 on Clonidine, and I have not had the anxiety or panic attacks.  I’m not going to take it tomorrow because I don’t want to become addicted to another drug with additive qualities.  If the anxiety returns tomorrow, I’ll take half the 0.01 dose that was prescribed that’s suggested in these comments.",Mike
19,Clonidine,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 22, 2020",111,"A word of advice: do not take the full 0.1 mg clonidine pill. Most of the people here complaining about the medication making them drowsy and fatigued are likely sensitive to clonidine and are taking a much higher dose than they should. Chances are, your doctor will prescribe 0.1 mg since there is no lower dose for this med. If after taking the full 0.1 mg pill makes you tired, cut it in half, if it still makes you tired, cut it into a quarter, and if still, cut it into an eighth. I recommend buying a pill cutter.When I first took it, I felt terrible at the full dose, but I then cut it like I just instructed and at an eighth of a 0.1 mg pill I felt waaaay better. Anxiety almost completely gone and it has worked even better than benzos. Plus, this med, unlike benzos, is not associated with any kind of brain damage and/or addiction.",Zack

21,Clonidine,Anxiety,10.0,,"August 9, 2020",71,"I was on clonidine from the age of 8-14 I didn’t want to take pills for the rest of my life so I stopped taking all my meds, half of which I didn’t even know what I was taking them for. About a month ago I started having really bad anxiety attacks. I felt like I was living completely out of my body, I felt awful and wanted to die if I’m being completely honest. After dealing with having them 1-2 times a week I called and got into counselling and requested to be put on medication. The psychiatrist called me a week after and recommend I take clonidine again and I recommend anybody with anxiety to try this medicine I was on it for 6 years and it really made a difference even the first day I started taking it again",Chiccamae

28,Clonidine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 28, 2020",66,"This drug clonidine was a game changer for my anxiety. I love this drug- it helps me sleep, it calms me down from full blown panic attacks (it takes about 20-30 minutes to do this). It helps with my ADHD because it calms down my body and lets me focus. I can't take benzos, so it has been really helpful. It takes a while before it stops making you drowsy. I only take half a tab if I'm super anxious during the day. I only take full tabs if I'm having a panic attack or going to bedWARNING: DO NOT STOP TAKING THIS DRUG COLD TURKEY. I had horrendous withdrawals. I stopped cold after 3 years and was shaking and tremoring, did not sleep for a week, and had severe panic attacks all day every day.",Meg

About a month ago I went into Manic Panic Depression and anxiety was off charts for the last month. I'm scared of Benzos and refuse to take them because of how good they are and addicting. Was prescribed Paxil 20 mg . They gave me Hydroxyzine 50mg until Paxil Kicks in. Paxil has not worked and went back to see about something stronger than Hydroxyzine. They gave me clonidine and it worked within an hour at .10 mg clonedine I was eating and even smiled after 3 weeks of nightmarish living. I think this will be the one!,Red

In the last 9 months my anxiety has been so severe that I’m anxious every second of the day and panic when I have to leave the house. It’s made it hard to function and hold down a job. I recently got a new job and I was having extreme anxiety to the point of feeling suicidal because I felt like I could not continue living with the severity of my anxiety. I was on 6 different medications and not getting any relief. Finally my doctor prescribed be clonidine 0.1 three weeks times a day. For the first time in 9 months I finally felt better. My doctor upped. My dose to 4 times a day and now I’m feeling better than ever! I’m able to function and work again. This is a miracle drug to me. I’m finally living my life again.

I rarely take it but when I do, it drastically reduces my anxiety and it’s not a benzo so it’s much easier to get a prescription for. I’d highly recommend it for anxiety. It does make me sleepy but I like that. When I’m feeling anxious I need that sedated feeling. It doesn’t make me feel zombie level sedated but I feel it enough to be able to get some sleep. Also, if you already have low blood pressure I would not recommend because it’s a blood pressure medication and could put you into a dangerously low blood pressure if you’re not careful.",J

46,Clonidine,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 13, 2018",46,"I have insane panic attacks in the morning. My 1mg of Klonopin hardly helps and of course I don't want to go up on them. I have detoxed from Klonopin once and obviously don't want to up the dose. Usually waking up in the morning my anxiety is 5/10... not quite to a panic attack. Riding a stationary bike for 30 minutes helps but even with that the Klonopin didn't do much. I've only taken clonidine for 2 days and take it when I don't have to go to work (numbs me out, which I consider a good thing. to some people this may not be) - but when I woke up in the morning my anxiety was still there but considerably lower. Maybe a 2.5/10 --- however, I gave it a few less stars because having too much, ironically, causes me to have a panic attack as I freak out when I feel like I've lost control of my body.",Banana Nut Muffins

I think it makes me feel way more relaxed than the benzos everyone wants and I've had high doses of Xanax and Klonopin prescribed to me and it's hard to get that stuff prescribed. The clonidine is very quick acting I've never had any kind of withdrawals and it mellows me out and unlike a benzo  it doesn't make me sound like I'm out of it. I've had other people take very small doses and and knocks them out but I tend to be on edge all the time and benzos don't really relax me but they do help if I'm having anxiety issues related to PTSD that makes me panic and freeze up,CidB
48,Clonidine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 9, 2018",46,"Clonidine can totally change your life. It can also make you a zombie during the first 2 to 4 weeks, but eventually you will normalize and become used to it. Only take the minimum needed to reduce your anxiety. Any more makes you a kind of altered consciousness (not in a good way) that leaves you empty of thought and too heavy, weak, tired and slow to live an ordinary life. For me, the dry eyes, and dry mouth is pretty bad if I take more than the usual dose. It also seems to alter the way some foods taste. It turns chocolate into a waxy, greasy mess (not in reality, just for you.) and most high fat processed foods taste really bad. Fresh foods and even natural fatty meat still tastes normal. I love and eat a lot of chocolate so this is a serious side effect!",KrustyArt

51,Clonidine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 26, 2017",70,Clonidine has been outstanding in lowering BP and in reducing anxiety.  I have lingering PTSD from a murder many years ago and from a stroke one year ago caused by high BP.  Other BP meds have worked marginally but the Clonidine patch was highly effective at .1 mg but a bit too much a .2 mg lowering BP to 96/60.  The only problem is the patch gives me a bright red itching rash on my arm and so I am going on the pills only and see if that works well. I'm hoping 0.1 mg twice a day should work since Clonidine has a 12 hour half life but we shall see.  I highly recommend this drug for BP and anxiety but monitor BP with it to not go too low.,Richard0460

I.e. the kind of anxiety that keeps me from sitting in one place. I take clonidine before any engagement where I must sit for a while, e.g., waiting rooms, court rooms and so on. Places where some patience is in order. Clonidine is the best for this. The only side effect is a very slight dry mouth, and that only happens sometimes.",Delegate Fishmon

55,Clonidine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 24, 2016",83,"Clonidine is excellent for performance and social anxiety. But I think its crucial to get the dosage just right for your body weight & metabolism, so that one doesn't get unnecessarily sedated or have dry mouth. I only use clonidine every now & a blue moon  (i.e., rarely), often before a situation or event where I'll need extraordinary patience. I take just 0.1 mg. for this purpose. It prevents nervous tremors of the hand, restlessness and sweating.",Johnny Doe

63,Clonidine,Anxiety,9.0,,"July 6, 2016",100,"Started taking clonodine BID for severe anxiety (GAD, PTSD, PD), in conjunction with my benzos (PRN).  I have tried almost everything else on the market and this was the first time I was really impressed with the effects.  The first week and a half I appreciated the intense drowsiness but I powered through because I physically felt relief from my racing heart.

67,Clonidine,Anxiety,6.0,,"December 3, 2015",63,"I was prescribed this when I went to a 5 day inpatient detox. They gave me this for anxiety as I could not use any benzos, due to my addiction. So when I left detox I remained on clonidine for about 5 months. It did significantly relax me, however, it lowered my blood pressure so bad that I would get  a head rush and faint almost everytime I stood up. Keep in mind my size definitely was a factor as I am only 5'1 and 98 lbs. At the time.",Kookla3193

69,Clonidine,Anxiety,8.0,,"October 26, 2015",61,"Clonidine is a drug that produces many obvious physical and psychological effects, the most obvious being marked drowsiness. It supposedly works to fight anxiety by interfering with the chemicals responsible for those horrible, anxious feeling, pounding heartbeat and fear reactions. To that end, it works very well. It's hard to say whether or not it has a large effect on experiencing anxiety overall, however.",MattyC2

Too much can be dangerous with it leading to low blood pressure. There have been times I exercised or took stimulant because I was worried blood pressure was to low but if you can ride the tide it is an amazing medicine for it not being in the Xanax class.",ElgatoJohn
