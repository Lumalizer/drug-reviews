0,Propranolol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 28, 2022",0,Been taking this for a day now I am currently on 10 MG I take it twice a day in the morning and the evening because I have had another relapse in my anxiety symptoms. It helps keep my heart rate steady and puts me at greater ease knowing I don't feel like I'm going to die with the thought of my anxiety. Currently I am on a dosage of 10 MG twice a day (20 MG total).  It is good at easing anxiety symptoms since I have the corona virus now my anxiety has gotten worse. I just had another relapse since being infected with testing positive for covid this morning. Overall it is good at making me feel calm however I have noticed that I get bad night mares and sleepy during the day it does what it says. Good drug for anxiety,Princess Rose
1,Propranolol,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 26, 2022",1,"I was prescribed propranolol for my anxiety and panic attacks. I have stages in my life where I have them daily and sometimes don't want to leave the house in fear of having an attack. My dr prescribed propranolol and told me to take it before social events to prevent the attack. One day me and my boyfriend planned to go to a market, so I took the pill. Thankfully we didn't leave the house for 30mins because I had the worst panic attack of my entire life. I felt like I was in the truman show! Nothing felt real, I was lightheaded and could not stop crying for hours. I had the impending doom feeling and thought I would end up in rehab. Worst experience of my life and has now affected the way I feel about taking any medication. Even paracetamol!",Mol
2,Propranolol,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 26, 2022",0,Honestly I’m someone who’s dealt with anxiety for my entire life and never quite felt like a functioning human being this has been a miracle pill and I wish I started years ago would of helped me in so many situations I never thought I’d be able to see the day where I wasn’t afraid of doing normal things without the feelings of sweaty palms and racing heart rate. My energy has improved my mood is at an all time high. I’m only 10 days in but things are looking good I should note this only helps with the physical symptoms of anxiety not so much with the psychological side. Hope you find your pill but I do recommend this one! No side effects at all !,Corbs
3,Propranolol,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 21, 2022",0,"I smoked Cannabis for 6 years straight everyday right up until two months ago when I noticed having spliffs was bringing on palpations and I felt generally weird.  I worked everyday but never high even though these feelings of anxiety would carry over till the morning. So I stopped smoking it this brought on a whole load of stress and more anxiety to the point I now have Generalised Anxiety Disorder, the only catch is I'm a high functioning Anxiety so I can still socialise, go to work, do tasks like everyone else but inside I have racing thoughts I feel as if I'm dying or living with an illness. I can go dizzy or feel like I'm falling. Yes when the doctor put me on Propanol you do feel back on planet earth but you can build a tolerance fast so just monitor yourself. Well it's not like you ain't anyway. After taking my two 10mg dose of Propanolol I'm currently having flutters (It Sucks). My anxiety causes me to feel like I'm falling, heart races, my vision has trials and hot flushes etc",Paul
4,Propranolol,Anxiety,,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 16, 2022",0,"I had taken this drug for over 40 years and found it to be by very effective indeed at 80  MG slow-release. Recently the drugs seem to lose its effectiveness and my heart rate soared during lockdown. It was increased to 160 mg and that proved to be just as ineffective unfortunately. I was changed to bisoprolol but I didn't realise that my body had got so used to taking propranolol that I went into a full-blown cold turkey shaking dithering mess! I rang my doctor and got put through to a pharmacist to said it must be the bisoprolol, we will stop that and put you on another one of the new beta blockers. This didn't work and I continued to feel full cold turkey experience which was absolutely like a nightmare. Eventually I tracked down one of my overworked GPS and she was wonderful and said that after 40 years my body and become so used to propranolol that I had gone into full cold turkey and must go back on it it don't ever stop taking this medicine unless you have to and if you do SLOWLY!!",Si99

I can tell I am calmer within 30 minutes of taking each dose & my thoughts slowed to a more normal pace. I have been on it two years now and have not had any bad side effects. I live a more confident life now & don't feel so stressed all the time & have more confidence in myself.,Abie
6,Propranolol,Anxiety,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2022",1,"Just left the doctors, after waiting almost 3 months to get in, my panic attacks got absolutely horrible, after being diagnosed with severe arthritis in my hips, I had to leave my job as I couldn’t stay on my feet very long, depression and high anxiety kicked in, I just took a 10 mg about an hour ago, I really don’t feel much better, maybe a little, I’ve read reviews on here so I’m hoping it just needs to get in my system. I was taking Klonopin ( years ago), but he didn’t want to write me that, so fingers crossed. I’m sorry for everyone that suffers from anxiety, truly, glad this medication has helped so many.",Janel
7,Propranolol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2022",2,"My husband died under traumatic conditions leaving me with anxiety, and PTSD. Despite counselling and taking a mild dose of Diazepam for over 18 months, I was wracked with anxiety on waking every morning. I would have heart palpitations, churning stomach, jelly like legs. Sometimes these awful symptoms dissipated as the day wore on, sometimes they didn’t and would increase in certain social situations. My GP decided to prescribe Propranolol 10mg, taken as soon as I wake.  I still take 3 mg of Diazepam a day, which I’ll be weaned off. After taking the first propranolol my anxiety abated after 30min. I have been taking them for a week now, my anxiety on waking has gone, I’m calmer and feel, since my husband’s death in 2020, that I have started to move forward as the awful physical symptoms are now under control. The side effect of tiredness, will I hope abate as time goes on.",Cotswold woman
8,Propranolol,Anxiety,9.0,,"February 22, 2022",3,"I used to feel somewhat anxious and pretty uncomfortable when minor events like where are  my car keys  or a moderately stressful event, say at work, took place. It’s hard to relax when you feel your heart hammering away.  Propranolol changed that for me. I feel less on edge, and I don’t get those super uncomfortable adrenaline surges over minor issues anymore. I am very pleased with the results, and there are no negatives for me.",Cindy
9,Propranolol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 17, 2022",1,"First let me just say wow! I am a great public speaker, but I once had an experience where I choked in front of 300 people. It was humiliating beyond words. Ever since I’ve had this fear that it would happen again. My brain turns on me, and goes into flight or fight. Adrenaline rushes to my heart, and if I don’t bring it under control in the first 30 sec it’s game over. This little  pill has completely changed my life. Fear of fear has been removed completely from speaking in public, job interviews etc. I landed a great job because I felt relaxed. It simply prohibits your brain from flooding your heart with adrenaline. 40 mg an hour before the thing and you just don’t hyperventilate. I think it also trains your brain to not go into flight or fight so easily, because I have on occasion forgotten to take it without a problem. Like my brain is Rewired now.",New Man

It definitely helps lower your HR. I did not notice any help with the anxiety. After being on it for a few weeks I got a lot of side effects, where I'd feel ""high""-fuzzy, confused, full body tingling, I got extreme vertigo and headache, and my pulse went down from 101 - 80, but then after a few weeks I'd get random pulse drops and go down to as low as 55 for like 3 mins at a time.

13,Propranolol,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 7, 2022",2,"I experienced a really bad panic attack which I believed I was dying and after this I kept experiencing the same sort of panic attacks. My doctor prescribed me 40mg of propranolol to help deal with the awful side effects that came from this- shaking, high heart rate and sweating. At first it helped greatly with reducing my heart rate and I was so thankful, about two weeks later I was the worst I had ever been. This medication will lower your blood pressure, this I was never told. I have had a normal LOW blood pressure my entire life. I started experiencing an abnormal heart rate which made my anxiety worse, my breathing felt altered and found it so hard to sleep. I also have the worst diarrhoea ever. I am afraid of this tablet, I have to now get weaned off it because they started me at 40mg and if I stop suddenly it might mess my heart up even more. I dread bedtime now and the side effect of these tablets, it had made me more anxious than ever.",marie

I'm talking about general and social anxiety, it helps a lot with this. In the mind you are still anxious but it feels like it doesn't matter because your body is so relaxed. For first time since my anxiety started I'm relaxed in every situation that before I would not have been able to tolerate . I'm taking 20 mg in the morning and 20 mg in the afternoon, like 9 hours later.  I don't have side effects. It really is good.",Dmm

I suffer with anxiety but it's more mental than physical so it just doesn't target that side of anxiety. 0 side effect, 0 benefits and a pain to take multiple times a day for nothing.

There is more difference from 10mg to 40mg than there is from 40mg compared to 80mg, but still, if you have huge anxiety symptoms like me: I feel as if I am put in a closed room 4 by 4 with a hungry lion, but instead I am just writing a message to some random girl, so 80mg helps me a lot more!",qwerty8888

20,Propranolol,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 3, 2021",6,Worst anxiety drug I have ever taken. If you have asthma do not let the doctor ever give this to you. Took 5 MG to try it and was prescribed a 20 MG dose twice per day which would have be so dangerous to me. Within 4 hours my body went into respiratory shock - horrible wheezing and coughing. Had to go to the ER to be put on a nebulizer and three days later my breathing is still messed up. Stay away from this may help some but not if you have asthma it should not be taken - stay away. The doctor is getting sued make sure they know what they are giving you they just hand anything out these days to avoid benzos for anxiety and panic attacks screw this medical system addicts ruined it for everyone else. Doctors would rather prescribe you a death pill than a calm down pill.,Nick
21,Propranolol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 17, 2021",3,"Well what a game changer.  Have anxiety that I found out today has been caused by an overactive thyroid. Been in fight or flight for three months at least 50% of the day, I took one 10mg tablet two hours ago, after half an hour I couldn’t feel my heart pounding anymore, after an hour I felt a sense of calm come over me. Now two hours in and feel totally relaxed, no nausea, no fast heart rate, no hot/cold body temp changes. No side effects like sickness, feeling worse etc. Just feel like I can relax properly for the first time in a couple of months. Can we also keep in mind I have a huge fear of taking new meds, not one panic with this. If your sitting on the fence, don't. Don’t think, just do it. You could very well be pleasantly surprised like I have. I of course thought the worst, but it’s the total opposite. And the fact you can take more if needed is a huge bonus. Finally something to help until my thyroid is under control",Sar1987
22,Propranolol,Anxiety,2.0,,"November 17, 2021",0,"Had really severe panic attacks 5 times a day, doctor prescribed me propranalol and I was desperate to try anything. It definitely stopped my panic attacks physically, but I still had anxious thoughts and had horrible side effects. I was extremely lightheaded, dizzy, felt weird pins and needles in certain places, just didn’t agree with my body and made me feel like a zombie. This ended up increasing my anxiety. Might be good to take as needed but definitely bad for long term use in my opinion. I was also on such a low dose of 10 mg 2x daily so I was surprised it reacted w me this way. I stopped this medication 3 days ago and am still feeling effects but it’s definitely better, just wanna feel normal again.",Caroline
23,Propranolol,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 3, 2021",3,"Always hated the spotlight but unfortunately I have to be in it sometimes. Each time would get the usual symptoms of racing heart, shaky voice / hands, stomach churning.I was  prescribed propranolol and was very doubtful it would do anything as it’s not a benzo etc. Initially it was 2X10mg but realised they don’t work for me until about 40 or 50mg. So went with 40-50mg (with the doctors knowledge). It made a huge difference. You still get mental anxiety and you prepare for all the physical symptoms to hit…then, SUDDENLY….nothing happens, no fast heart, shakes etc. A couple of min later you realise the physical symptoms aren't coming and you can calm down mentally and just get on with it.Lasts 3-4 hours. Discussed the dosage with the doctor (effect not lasting long/having take take to many 10mg tabs) and was changed to 80mg Prolonged release and they work great.

The prompt was reading about a person that made a quick exit from their work place because of an anxiety attack, they thought they were going to get diabetes because they ate a chocolate bar - lol excuse me but I was there too. Propranolol puts me in the moment not in the past or the future... I don't feel detached just in the moment and I am able to collect my thoughts.

Before seeing her, I would get nervous in large crowds, but nothing big. I never had a history of blood pressure or heart issues. She prescribed this, telling me to take it in situations where I would be around a lot of people, though the bottle said every 8 hours. I took one that day, and I didn't feel any different. I figured it was just something to get used to, so I took one daily for the next 4 days. Didn't feel anything. On the 6th day, my husband and I went to a hockey game. 5 mins in, I had a full blown panic attack, including nausea, racing thoughts, racing heartbeat. This was the first panic attack I've ever had.

The worry that our granddaughter who is CEV will catch Covid-19 plays on my mind from the time I wake until I go to sleep.

The worry is still there making it hard to breath but it's much better than it was a week ago. It will cause depression so to equal it out you need to walk a hour a day plus do medication for 30mins.  My doctor said try headspace. Not try it yet but I do the hour walking.

I thought I was going to die, and I am used to taking Valium but propranolol was the only thing he offered so I though I would give it a try , horrible. My doctor sounds like he hasn’t even finished school , sounds uneducated, doctors will give out the worst tablets (with worst side effects ) like sweets , but the real stuff that does the job and has very minimal side effects they do not want to give out too easily, propranolol had over 20 serious side effects and I had over half of them , it made my anxiety worse .

My friend took me to hospital and a mental health team has arranged for me to see a psychiatrist how ever while waiting the shaking has been so bad that most days I've stayed in bed and just slept.

I couldn't believe how fast it worked my shaking had gone within 15 to 20 minutes I wish antidepressants worked as fast. I think this drug is amazing for anxiety. My doctor said stay on short term but I'm thinking I would rather keep taking then I read that it can cause depression and weight gain.

Changing positions/elevation when I lay down and stand up seemed to worsen/start up my symptoms, as well as mornings when I leaned up or sat up the pounding would set in, another symptom was standing or walking for to long I would get an intense pressure in chest and would have to lay down immediately. The anxiety developed from dealing with all of this was present very frequent, so... My doctor prescribed 10mg as needed daily of propranolol. I take 10mg in the morning, 10mg in the afternoon, and 10mg at night if needed. Making it 3x a day of 10mg if needed.

48,Propranolol,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 3, 2021",202,When initially sought help for panic attacks I was prescribed a benzo (either Ativan or Klonopin) which worked at first but tolerance built up I ended up on high doses of Xanax at one point taking 10 mgs a day. I had to go to a detox unit to get off of them and the rebound anxiety from that was the most mentally and physically excruciating thing I've ever had to endure in my life. Highly advise against benzos. Over the years my anxiety has lessened dramatically. I've come to know Jesus Christ as my Savior and attribute most if not all of that to Him and our relationship. I do struggle with fairly bad anxiety occasionally. I read about propranolol but was skeptical that it would work for me BUT IT DOES! I take 40mg as needed. Getting relief from the physical symptoms of anxiety ends up relieving the mental.  It's been a few years now since originally prescribed propranolol and it still works great.

It helped with the attacks but I was so exhausted off them I couldn't function properly, felt spacey and dizzy was in a right mess but it kept the attacks at bay so was worth it.

I take 40mg 3 times a day it helps my anxiety no end before I wasn't on this medication I would get severe anxiety attacks to the point where I was experiencing physical symptoms such as heart palpitations and chest pain and a racing heart rate which was scary due to anxiety.  Ever ever since I have taken this medication I feel more calmer and spaced out I do get 1 side effect though and that is tiredness but that is normal I can live with that side effect I am so pleased with this medication would highly recommend if you have anxiety.

I was very hesitant at first to take this as I was nervous for the side effects (darn you anxiety!) but I did not get any side effects! I have found that it’s better to take this before you know you’re going into a situation that will make you nervous. However, if you take it in the morning it will help all day.

He told me that this is a medication I can take when necessary. I normally take it when symptoms of anxiety arise, and I find it helps to reduce them. It works best as a preventative measure, however. For example, if I am going into a situation that I know causes anxiety (like going to see a doctor), I take one an hour before and don't face my regular symptoms. I find this medication helpful, but I don't think it's a complete answer to my problems.

Plus it protects heart from a heart attack which is very likely due to strong family history at the young age. + treats migraine. 3 birds shot with one tablet and feels like I won the lottery :)",Anonymous

It started messing with my heart's electrical system and caused an irregular heart beat occasionally. Basically, at night my heart rate would slow way down and actually skip a beat making me wake up in a gasp. I would also feel this when I worked out. I was told this isn't dangerous by my Dr. but that is tough to believe when it feels like your heart stops for a second. So, occasionally, I think this drug is great. Just be careful taking it daily.

However you don't get the shakiness anymore, no more redness, and you talk with confidence.
