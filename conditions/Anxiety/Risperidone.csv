0,Risperidone,Anxiety,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 1, 2022",2,"It didn’t really seem to do anything? I’m still an anxious, slightly unstable and easily-paranoid person just now I swallow half a pill at night. At least I don’t seem to have any side effects either. Ahh although it’s harder to orgasm? Might be situational. I think I’m on like 0.5mg. My head feels a little empty but I think that’s more a result of what I went through. Just realized thinking doesn’t do me any good for the inevitable.",Name

After 3 days I had a racing heart, akathisia and attempted suicide, by taking all the remaining Risperidone. Someone called 911. I ate charcoal and spent a day in the hospital. This drug made me feel terrible, in so many ways. It is indescribable.I was doing the shuffle walk as I paced around in anxiety. The way you see people walking in movies during mental hospital scenes. It was a nightmare.",Deadly

3,Risperidone,Anxiety,4.0,,"September 26, 2021",1,"I've been on risperidone for 5 years now. I took it at the beginning for psychosis and it worked fairly well. Two years ago, I was on 2mg I started to get really bad anxiety and panic. I lowered it to 1mg and I wanted to come right off of it but the doctor wouldn't let me. I've recently been put on another medication that raises the levels of risperidone and I've had a return of this anxiety/panic/low mood. It's a good drug that can have amazing effects on people, but if you start experiencing really bad negative emotions, don't rule out risperidone for being the culprit.",Juan Sanchez

5,Risperidone,Anxiety,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 5, 2021",2,"0.5mg of Risperidone and 5mg of lexapro have been neutral so far: within the past week I have felt a good bit of brain fog along with very slow thinking patterns. I sometimes forget to eat or drink liquids because my brain feels so relaxed sometimes, which is concerning. No weight gain noticed so far, has stayed pretty much the same, my sugar binging has stopped which is a benefit. Only thing that concerns me is the massive brain fog I have and sudden memory loss or ""blackouts"" where I forget where I am or what's going on, I'm not even in my 20s yet so that's not normal for me even when I'm not on medication. Pros: Sudden memory recollections and remembering random things, calm and outgoing now, can talk to people, no weight gain so farCons: Heavy memory fog and brain fog interferes with my job and life, slow thinking at work and at home, short term memory loss, lack of appetite, too relaxed, possible serotonin syndrome, mild diarrhea",K

12,Risperidone,Anxiety,9.0,,"October 15, 2020",7,"I have been in an out of medication for managing anxiety disorder for the past 5 years. I'd say risperdal was the best. I took .5mg for the first month, then increased that dosage to 1mg within the second month. I took risperdal for 3 months in combination with 37.5mg effexor, which I had been taking previously for 5 months before starting risperdal.The Cons:I gained 20lbs within the 3 months of taking risperdal. This is the reason I stopped. With stopping the pill, regular exercise and diet, I lost it. The Pros: I regained my ability to function normally. The adjustment period was good, I think I only experienced headaches and light sensitivity. The withdrawal period was also good, no symptoms. I found that I could focus on tasks and schoolwork again, my mood significantly improved, and I had regained confidence. Regular panic attacks and self harm completely subsided. Honestly, it was a life changer.",nickname

17,Risperidone,Anxiety,10.0,,"September 14, 2020",19,I feel bad reading the reviews on this risperidone drug that made people feel worse. Risperidone has done wonders for me and I’ve only been on it for three months. I suffer from disassociative identity disorder and severe irritability due to autism. My irritability has only been lowered a little bit but I am no longer having disassociative spells where I’m staring at the wall for 4+ hours at a time without realizing it. I also have bipolar disorder and take a different medication for that but this in conjunction with my other medication has worked out really well. I take a very low-dose only .25 mg once a day. I didn’t think that such a small dose would do anything for me but I have absolutely noticed a difference in my behavior and actions. Like I said I feel terrible for the people who have given it bad reviews that it didn’t work for them because it is truly changed my life,Xoxgoldenfoxx

My anxiety turned into full-on paranoia and I could hardly think or speak clearly. Then suddenly I woke up and felt calm and collected. No more racing thoughts, no more battles inside my own head. I'm so grateful for this medication. My only regret is that I took so long thinking I could cure myself with exercise, faddy diets and supplements. I should have gone on this a long time ago.

I became dependant on it and it made me delusional, fatigued, my ability to do anything became poor and my behaviour became strange and eccentric. I gained weight and I felt as if I had something wrong with me. It calmed my nerves but that was the dangerous part about taking this medication - I became mentally addicted to it and that’s why I never fought to come off it until I realised just how much it was ruining my life.Overall I have no words to describe the amount of damage this medication has done to me. I am no longer on this medication and I am so grateful that after almost a year I’m starting to feel better.

I quit after only 3 weeks because I had read that Risperdal can cause seizures and already being at risk for them and having a lowered threshold towards them I just could not get that out of my head and relax with this medicine. If it had not been for that I would be on it still.",monicaileana
60,Risperidone,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 17, 2013",124,Started initially at low 0.5 mg nightly dose and it helped a little.  Then went to 1.0 mg and within days felt an amazing sense of calm and peace.  They say it is serotonergic at low doses.  No side effects. It's a keeper.,WonderBoy

63,Risperidone,Anxiety,9.0,,"January 11, 2013",160,"Really helped me with severe anxieties and mood swings. Calms me down, makes me less irritated and obsessive, helps me fall asleep. Better to take it before going to sleep. I tried taking it in the morning and couldn't get through the day (feeling too sleepy and out of it). It works wonders for those with extreme emotions.",Lena7779
