1,Oxazepam,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 4, 2021",0,"Oxazepam (Serax) is the only benzodiazepine that manages my anxiety and does not turn me into a walking zombie.  I have taken Ativan, Xanax, Valium, and Klonopin.  These last four make me feel woozy, and it's difficult for me to function in an effective way.I like oxazepam because it begins working for me in 30 minutes, and definitely helps my anxiety (which can be so physically uncomfortable.) The only downside is that it sometimes makes me overwhelmingly sleepy.  I combat this with drinking coffee.  If it's nighttime, it also helps me fall asleep, without a morning hangover.",gazelle416

3,Oxazepam,Anxiety,10.0,,"January 19, 2021",6,"Diagnosed with a rare chronic disease, which simply worsened my anxiety symptoms as the thought that I can die at any moment (though statistics say otherwise) has taken over my mind and I cannot function at times during the day. I was prescribed sertraline and oxazepam for as long as it took for the main drug  to kick-in. Been on this combo for just over a month. Supposedly the sertraline would work for the anxiety, so far I have not seen any meaningful improvement from it, so I still rely to the oxazepam, usually 10mg in the morning, adding another 10mg in the afternoon, if needed. Takes 30-45 mins to kick in and gives you an average of 6-7hrs of clear mind, ability to concentrate and a normal attitude (i.e. anxiety not detectable). Fully aware of the fact that I have to get off it at some point but the sertraline has done nothing for me in the last 5 weeks, so far oxazepam is the only thing keeping me standing with some dignity. No side-effects really.",Teliosame
4,Oxazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 16, 2020",7,"Hi, I use Oxazepam only to help me falling asleep and it does work for me. I tend to take half of a 10mg tablet ( I only took few times in my life the whole 10mg tablet as it has too strong effects on me) in the night or early morning after I wake up. So I try to train myself to fall asleep on my own initially in the evening without the drug. But I have big problems to fall asleep again (Meaning if I wake up between 2-6am). When I take it after waking up, just 5mg, I tend to fall asleep within an hour again. I used to take it only twice a week or so, but am doing and experiment in taking it daily (during the night) for about a week now. I feel good, as waking up rested, though a bit drowsy. I think that any drug works for me in small quantities. Even the 10mg would be too much. And I can't believe that there can be even stronger dosages than 10mg. I would be so drowsy if I took that.  I need to catch up on sleep before I want to withdraw from taking it.",Teri
5,Oxazepam,Anxiety,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 4, 2020",25,"Was prescribed Oxazepam for mild anxiety which became worse the more I took the drug, but I  was totally unaware it was the drug actually making the problems worse, I have just started to try and slowly come off the drug after 6 months and the withdrawals are horrendous!

Before Istarted on this drug, I was having at least one panic attack every day, and I would get them every day before work.  They also help with my racing thoughts too, which is incredible.

Oxazapam just works for me, it has a slow onset which allows you to relax.  This medication also does wonders for me when I'm at work and feeling stressed!

8,Oxazepam,Anxiety,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 6, 2019",20,"I have been taking this medication oxazepam for the last month and a half. My dosage is a half of a 15mg tablet 3 times a day. I find it has had some unwanted side effects, like muscle twitching, confusion, dizziness (feeling like I'm on a boat even when I'm sitting or lying down) jumbled speech, memory loss, and I seem to wake up and can't get back to sleep!. My honest advice would be to use this medication cautiously!!.",Chris.
9,Oxazepam,Anxiety,10.0,,"August 31, 2019",36,"Due to suffering fairly crippling anxiety about 12 months ago, I was prescribed oxazepam by an excellent doctor which has definitely assisted me  returning to normal life.Initially the dosage of oxazepam was 30mg to take as needed on the basis of not to take more than 3 times a week, then reduced to 15mg and now finally I can manage to have my anxiety dissipate on 1/4 tablet ie 4mg and would only take 1-2 times a week.  For me it's been a life saver knowing that I can take this as needed to function when I am about to face a stressful situation. It also has been  helpful to keep the medication within reach during the day and then see if I can manage without to help manage the anxiety over the long term as well as using other relaxation techniques as recommended by my psychologist. No side effects noticed, no drowsiness on the lower dosages, it actually gives me clarity of thought as I'm relaxed.",Sarah
10,Oxazepam,Anxiety,9.0,,"June 16, 2019",41,"I was in several inpatient mental health wards over the past 8 years, both public and private,  initially they diagnosed me with schizophrenia and depression (then later anxiety). I think there aren't many benzodiazepines I have not tried. During inpatient treatment I was given highish doses of Lorazepam which was somewhat difficult to cease, Lorazepam more so than Xanax! Following this I was prescribed Diazepam  for years as an outpatient, I abused it, but with little consequence! stopped taking it abruptly and no withdrawals. Then my Psychiatrist prescribed me Oxazepam, and well it is difficult/pointless to abuse for me personally, but excellent for managing anxiety symptoms without much sedation or amnesia. I currently take 30mg mane daily and rarely 15mg extra nocte. This magic pill (Alepam/Serapax) has also reduced my desire for other drugs of abuse both medical and illicit, Thank you Lord for oxazepam!",Grasshopper
11,Oxazepam,Anxiety,8.0,,"March 15, 2019",142,"Oxazepam turned me back to myself, without feeling high. However, after 8 hours, I begin to torture myself by thinking negatively about the negative comments in here and I got so scared. My anxiety without this pill is almost constant. I struggle with the notion of being on a drug and feeling better but being addicted and needing more. I am 61 years old. The anxiety has turned me from a powerfully confident guy to the Cowardly Lion. My family sees the suffering and says: just take the pill. They respect my trying to be strong: but: the anxiety really takes over. So, I will try to approach it positively. My doctor says: why would you want to get off it? Just stay on it forever because nothing else has worked and you are suffering miserably. I see her point. Why would any of us take this: with a goal of stopping it?  Just let it do it’s work. Be thankful. Enjoy the freedom from the anxiety. I am talking myself into this. Does anyone see what I mean?",Eddie14

13,Oxazepam,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 2, 2019",31,Absolutely worse when you hit tolerance after 4 years! As with all benzos not worth it. I see all the good reviews and think I feel sorry for these people when they don't address the underlying issues and pop a pill that is ohhh so fantastic until one day bang! It just won't work. I was prescribed these and never abused them. At my worst I was taking a massive dose just for 4 hrs sleep.Please think twice or do research.

15,Oxazepam,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 21, 2018",34,"I am now 65 years old and at the age of 16 I was prescribed valium for anxiety. My doctor continued to increase the dosage and eventually put me on serepax (Oxazepam). I   was addicted to both of these medications and it took me at least 10 years to come off these suffering huge withdrawals. When my daughter died in 2006 in a fire I was offered tranquilises which I refused knowing my addiction to them.  I was later refused any compensation by the Melbourne Medical Board because I refused any medical help in the form of antidepressants, be very careful don't take any of these drugs because they might seem great at the time but you will pay for it in the long run.",Judy
16,Oxazepam,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 9, 2018",18,"I was put on this medication a couple of weeks ago. I take medicine for my OCD and I also take Remeron to sleep. Lately I haven't been able to control my anxiety/intrusive thoughts and was put on Oxazapem 15 mg one hour before bedtime. It is great - it makes me really sleepy and gives me the munchies - I literally eat everything I can think of 5 minutes before collapsing in my bed. I can see why people would want to abuse this drug. My only problem is that my concentration levels have gotten really bad after taking Oxazapem. I am working daily and not many people know what I am struggling with (OCD and intrusive thoughts), so it is hard to maintain the ""normal looking me"" at work. Hopefully people will just think I am a bit tired or stressed out and it will pass soon.",OCD-patient
17,Oxazepam,Anxiety,7.0,,"January 25, 2018",27,"I was given this to replace xanax for panic attacks because xanax is so addictive, apparently. Unfortunately for me, who only takes it on an as-needed basis, oxazepam does not have the same ability to quell panic attacks instantly once they have started. Instead, I have to take this in anticipation of an event happening, which I don't really like to do, because I'm never sure. In general, though, it does calm me down if I plan ahead before certain panic-inducing events (like plane trips), but doesn't help for unexpected panic attacks.",Cather
18,Oxazepam,Anxiety,5.0,,"January 18, 2018",25,"It's a strange one for me. I am prescribed them for acute anxiety, whenever the bouts come. The thing is, they work. The relief is beautiful and it's nice to regain what feels like a normal perspective of things, to bring an end to the myriad of worried thoughts. But once it starts to wear off, the anxiety slowly returns, but more so, gets worse. On top of that, I can feel so hopeless for days after taking just one pill, which can turn into depression if I'm not careful. It's a pill that gives relief, but the adverse symptoms are not worth it. I maybe take them a couple of times a year at points where I'm otherwise unable to function at all (I don't like medication )",Asdf12321

Having been through a rehab system 10 years ago I am EXTREMELY cautions about taking these. What's not clear is how quickly physical dependence forms, and how brutally hard the detox can be. Along with alcohol, these or any other benzos are one of the only detoxes you can die from, and the detox is brutal for lack of a better word.Having said that, for irregular use so long as control is present without denial, these work terrific to quell an  anxiety attack thats building.
