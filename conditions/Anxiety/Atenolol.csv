0,Atenolol,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2022",1,Healthy 21 y/o male with GAD & PTSD from the UK. This medication actually really works for anxiety and should be prescribed more often! SSRIs can help with the mental side of anxiety but this works for the physical side of anxiety as good as benzos with less problems. If your anxiety is triggered you may feel the electric zap sensation running down your spine but after that NOTHING! It stops the cycle of anxiety in its tracks because your body stays chill so then your mind does too and you can move on. Can be unpleasant the first time you take it with dizziness and a slow heartbeat (and that was only with 1/2 a pill - 12.5mg). Unfortunately I had to stop this medication because it made me VERY breathless which is only a side effect in asthmatics so I am going to see my doctor about this because it shouldn’t happen in healthy people taking atenolol ( I also can’t breathe as well with benzos). Would still recommend regardless (for non-asthmatics). Good luck everyone!,Anonymous
1,Atenolol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 25, 2022",1,"I started taking this due to racing heart and panic attacks that develop when I am in a crowded place and wearing a mask for coronavirus protection. It works very well and makes my heart rate fall to about 55, and lowers blood pressure about 10 points. I also had high blood pressure and this is a double benefit. I tried diuretics and ARB for blood pressure but both had rather severe side effects for me. The only negative side effect I have with Atenolol is very weird and vivid dreams if I take it at night so I only take it in the morning or afternoon. Also, I weigh lift and jog and this drug does not interfere at all, whereas diuretics and ARB made me feel light headed and dizzy to the extent I worried I might injure myself while exercising. I am very satisfied.",Ron in Tokyo
2,Atenolol,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 13, 2022",0,"I have been taking 12.5mg since 2007 after I suffered health anxiety after recording high blood pressure. I actually fear having my BP taken and my heart rate increases even when I take it myself (but it is never as bad as at the doctors!). In 2019 I had a palpitation attack and same in 2021. I was fully checked and no issues but the doctor said to continue taking as it would help with stress / palpitations in any case. My blood pressure without it has always been less than 140/90 and with it less than 130/80. I generally take it in the morning and the only side effect I do not like is that even at the low dose my HR can sit at 50 bpm or so and I sometimes get a tiny bit light headed if standing up quickly. If I do not take it for a bit my HR is generally late 50s - 60 BPM. I am not super-fit but I do walk a lot. I'd rather not take it, but I worry that stopping would cause other issues, so I tolerate it.",AMV
3,Atenolol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 20, 2021",3,"I've been on atenolol for 12 years, first 100mg a day, and the last 4 years 50mg a day.. It fixed me up real good. Ever see the movie Limitless?Well, that's what atenolol been for me. All symptoms gone from day one. As far as long term negative effect, I haven had any. This is an amazing pill.",AEO LA
4,Atenolol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 17, 2021",10,This has definitely removed that heavy chest feeling that leads to all day anxiety and turning to panic attacks. I feel fine and if I do happen to get an adrenaline rush from somethinglike a scare  it lasts a second and goes away not leading up to an anxiety or panic attack. Keeps me very chill. Heart rate was usually 75 to 80. Now it’s 62 to 65 resting. I was prescribed 25mg but took 12.5mg for a week To get acclimated with the medication and that did the trick for me. I had high blood pressure  because of my anxiety that usually ran about 140/90 and now it 110/65. This medication has been a game changer for me as I am a firefighter. It keeps me level and I don’t get overly excited and in situation it helps me stay focused on what I need to be focused on. If you have a hard time with anxiety meds like Zoloft and others I highly suggest you try this.,TPG
5,Atenolol,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 11, 2021",35,"I needed to share my experience with this drug. If I could go back in time, I WOULD HAVE NEVER TAKEN THIS! It worked well for my anxiety but the side effects I experienced a month later of taking this at a 12.5-25 mg dosage was awful. I had extreme shortness of breath, chest pains, tingling in my arms (especially my left arm) and feeling lethargic. I stopped taking this medication right when these side effects started as I thought I was having a heart attack and it has been the worst medication to come off of. I stopped taking this a WEEK AGO and I have had unbearable anxiety, heart palpitations all day and night, lethargy, insomnia etc.  I see my doctor this week to get an EKG and do other testing after taking this drug. I know everyone's experience is different but this drug for me was a true nightmare. Side effects on any medication can start at anytime not just right away. What I had to go through this last week withdrawing from the drug, I wouldn't wish on anyone",Anonymous

7,Atenolol,Anxiety,10.0,,"March 1, 2021",63,"I've had severe anxiety since I was a child, I've always worried about something usually health related. In my late teens I began to have panic attacks, seen the doctors and they all gave stuff like prozac, zoloft, and hydroxyzine. But last year I was having bad anxiety that lasted for weeks at a time and it was all panic attacks. I was getting heart rates in the 150s at a minimum and 180 at the max in the ER bed, they tried the hydroxyzine and Benadryl to calm me down and knock me out, it didn't really work. Then I got a different ER dr who gave me Atenolol 25MG, and let me tell you, this is the ONLY thing that worked. It stops panic attacks right in its tracks after 30 mins or so. No shakiness, no high heart rate, no sweating. Even in stressful situations which you would normally panic you stay calm, it doesn't act up. I take half a pill as needed, and when I need it, it always worked and has kept me out of the ER for anxiety. If your dr gives you this I highly recommend you try it.",NA
8,Atenolol,Anxiety,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2021",13,"Took atenolol for only a couple weeks for anxiety, maybe 2 or 3 times a week. It definitely calmed me down but after a couple weeks I noticed I was really depressed, especially when I took the atenolol. To the point where suicidal thoughts were swimming around in my head and I felt hopeless 24/7. Turns out beta blockers like atenolol actually affect your brain too, and this can lead to depression.  If you decide you want to take this drug for anxiety, it should only be used in emergency situations, this is a serious drug.",Joe
9,Atenolol,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 21, 2020",26,"Don't normally respond to these reviews, but feel need to share my experience from using atenolol. Not sure how it makes me feel, but my exercise life is the greatest. For years I was unable to run or jog for long distance for short of breath. Maybe a 1/2 to 1 mile max, and I'm totally exhausted. Now I jog/run 2 3/4 miles (bout 11 laps), 4 times a week with energy to spare. Also, I suffered with anxiety going for doctors visits, pulse and heart rate was off the roof, especially when I was up for my yearly DOT certification physical. So again, not quite sure how this med works but it is truly God sent.",Anonymous
10,Atenolol,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 30, 2020",31,"Atenolol worked fantastic for my performance anxiety. I had a big fear of public speaking, and whenever I needed to do a work presentation, my heart would beat so fast that I would get short of breath and wouldn't be able to speak properly, with shaky voice etc. My GP prescribed me 50mg atenolol to take 1 hour before, and it works great, by removing the rapid heart beat. Propranolol appears to be the most common prescribed medication for this issue, however I found Atenolol does the job perfectly.",Meyd
11,Atenolol,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 13, 2020",44,"It’s only been two days but my BP is lower than it’s been all year. I have rebound insomnia From Klonopin withdrawal- not my choice. Pharmacy refused to refill it after 23 years. I went through a nightmare withdrawal. Haven’t slept more than two hours a night in six months.  Then all the things I was taking it for came right back. Anxiety, spasms, constant twitching etc. I have fibromyalgia, arthritis, severe spinal stenosis. Sleep was always poor - woke constantly in a panic. The last two nights I’ve slept almost six hours without waking. So far no side effects. This med is a God send. Plus it was only $3.24 for a 90 day supply.",Katka
12,Atenolol,Anxiety,9.0,,"August 27, 2020",26,"For those of you taking benzos and still have social anxiety I highly recommend that you try out this drug atenolol it's a wonder drug,  yes benzos are effective but they kinda numbs your ability to feel, so I did my homework and went for the atenolol, feeling superb.",Drogba
13,Atenolol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 23, 2020",73,"I don’t normally have high BP or anxiety. I was prescribed atenolol 25 mg daily years ago in the midst of a divorce, by a concerned obgyn who was worried about my very high BP and stress/anxiety. I’m so glad he recommended this over anti-anxiety meds! It really helped me sleep and got me through that tough time. I appreciate its subtle calming affect that does not alter my mood. I began taking it again 6 weeks ago due to stress, and again I’m so impressed with how subtle it is and how normal I feel. I’m now cutting the dose down to 12.5 mg because it was making me a little too drowsy. I hope that’s a good sign that my anxiety is coming back down. Atenolol is a great option to try before heading to the heavier anti-anxiety arsenal, I think.",Gavilan
14,Atenolol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 18, 2019",49,"Atenolol has a great calming effect overall on my anxiety.  Could also exercise more.  No more anxiety, rapid heart rate, nervousness.  Better sleep/rest quality.",Nzy
15,Atenolol,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 9, 2019",31,"So this has worked pretty well for me! I started on 25 mg once a day for high blood pressure, high heart rate and anxiety. So far it’s been doing it’s job, my heart doesn’t feel like it’s going to burst out of my chest and I am not 24/7 anxious anymore. While I’m taking it I don’t really realize the difference, I just feel a little calmer though when I forget a dose that’s when I freak out a little bit and realize it. I’ve only really had dizziness as a side effect, sometimes I’ll also be more tired then usual though it’s nothing dramatic. Just be cautious if you have low blood sugar, my doc said I’d be fine as long as I keep an eye on myself though it really sneaks up on you while you’re taking atenolol. I don’t realize that my blood sugar is getting too low sometimes cause I don’t get as shaky or anxious since I’m on this so that’s something to watch out for. Other then that it’s been good to me though!! It’s really affordable as well!!",Sam
16,Atenolol,Anxiety,10.0,,"June 18, 2019",84,I've suffered situational anxiety for 4 years. Every time I had to speak in a group I'd have a panic attack. My heart would pound in my chest like a jackhammer and my voice would shake. It was so embarrassing and I feared it would hurt my career. I tried behavioral therapy and benzos to manage my anxiety. Nothing really worked until I tried Atenolol. It is an absolute Godsend. It steadied my heart rate and enabled me to not only speak in groups but also deliver presentations in front of a bunch of people. I highly recommend Atenolol for people suffering situational anxiety. I had one bad experience in public speaking my brain had learned to flood my body with adrenal any time I had to speak in public. The fight-or-flight response in my body created a vicious cycle where I would fear being afraid.I recommend behavioral therapy in conjunction with taking Atenolol. Therapy can help you understand the root mental/emotional cause of your anxiety.,Sergeant Tubbs

I wanted to go on something that was not addictive and I didn’t want anything that made me feel like a zombie. I wish more doctors would use medications like this as a first line treatment as it doesn’t take 4-6 weeks to get to a therapeutic level like antidepressants and there is not a risk of dependence like there is with benzodiazepines.,Momma dog18

I got on atenolol for my anxiety, I take it sometimes twice daily. I find that it lowers my heart rate which calms me down since I am not worrying what I could possibly have. I like it a lot. It is a nice small pill that I take and I have had a heart rate in the 50s from it... But it usually is more subtle and does not move the number of beats per minute that much.

23,Atenolol,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 17, 2017",35,"Let me start off by saying that I've done my research on Atenolol--it doesn't have the greatest track record, and there's a lot of evidence coming out saying that it doesn't actually protect your heart or arteries from damage.But Atenolol is the only thing that has worked to control my heart. I used to have high BP (160/100) and tachycardia at times, but as soon as I started taking Atenolol, it was like I was normal again. And I can definitely tell a difference when I stop taking it.I get a little shortness of breath very infrequently and my pulse is sometimes under 60bpm, but it's the one drug that has worked for years.

I haven't noticed that my anxiety is down so I still take my .25 xanax when I need it. I also haven't noticed any side effects other than a little dizziness and a little chest tightness.
