0,Kava,Anxiety,9,,"October 26, 2021",2,"If you're feeling euphoria you are taking too much. Take the lowest dose and take it once a day at bed time. I took the lowest dose during the day and it made my head spinny but definitely was effective against anxiety and panic it also took care of all the symptoms of premenopause. I took it at bed time which was the most effective time of day for me. I would come off it for several days once a month during which time my symptoms came back. I stopped taking it when they took it off the market. Then I took probiotics and magnesium, vitamin D3. I have read in  the years since that taking the form that is processed with nail polish remover (acetone?) is the kind that can interfere with liver enzymes raising them. I suggest you find a supplier who process is as the indigenous do in the Pacific, the Philipines, Indonesia, Malaysia",Anon

5,Kava,Anxiety,10,,"July 25, 2016",46,"Kava is as close to the effects of Valium as one can get from a legal substance. It definitely is a direct muscle relaxant and definitely does it through the GABA receptors. However, there's no lassitude - no real euphoria or feeling of elation either - but to me that's the actual beauty of kava. It's GABAergic effect is most noticeable when taken during a time of discomfort.Kava has quickly reversed full-blown panic attacks and also markedly reduced pain, probably because of it's direct muscle relaxation. I also sleep like a baby after taking it. But if one is looking for an upfront euphoria (i.e., a recreational drug) then that person is likely to think that kava does nothing.",C100T340
6,Kava,Anxiety,10,,"May 30, 2016",39,"I have had serious issues with a-fib together with a heart rate of 150-170 for over 3 weeks. I have had a heart ablation surgery, and am now on 3 different blood pressure/heart regulation pills.  Lately, as soon as I lay down at night, my heart has begun to pound in my chest, so badly that I can't go to sleep.  If I finally do go to sleep, it is still doing the same dance when I wake up.  My chest burns & I am exhausted for the rest of the day.  BUT, at the suggestion of an old fashioned Mexican lady who is a dear friend of mine, I began steeping two tea bags of Kava in boiling water for 5 minutes and drinking that before bed time.  My blood pressure (which is usually around 135/85  immediately goes down to NORMAL (115/75).  I can sleep!",Sickofsick2
