0,Cymbalta,Anxiety,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 23, 2022",1,"I was prescribed Cymbalta for my anxiety. I suffer from migraines and paroxysmal hypertension which have been debilitating. I really wanted Cymbalta to work however it made my hypertension episodes much worse and I could not take it after the fifth dose. I also suffered from new onset night sweats, nausea and decreased appetite, dizziness, constipation and increased anxiety and agitation.  I’m sure that it has helped many people however the side effects for me were too severe to continue. It’s possible I could’ve continued if I did not have to work, but I have a full-time job. I will be trying another anxiety medication perhaps an SSRI. I just think that my body cannot handle the SSNRI. Everyone is different. My mom take Cymbalta and she had no side effects whatsoever and it works wonderfully for her. My mom suffers from migraines and fibromyalgia. I hope this helps somebody",Hope
1,Cymbalta,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 14, 2022",2,"I was on this drug for 5 years, it helped with my depression tremendously. I came off it last year because things were going okay for me. I was diagnosed with GAD/Panic disorder when I was a teenager, the anxiety came back and I talked to my doctor about this, so I figured going back on Cymbalta was the right thing to do, but I was wrong. I do not struggle with depression anymore, just anxiety and panic attacks - going back on Cymbalta made my anxiety so much more worse, I think it had something to do with the Noradrenaline. The withdrawals sucked and I needed diazepam to help with it, I'm feeling so much better off of Cymbalta that the anxiety is so much smaller now, I'm going to be on an SSRI this time (Zoloft) This drug isn't for everyone, but I would not recommend it for people who struggle primarily with anxiety and Panic Disorder.",Not for Anxiety

3,Cymbalta,Anxiety,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 31, 2022",1,"I went on cymbalta for depression, anxiety, and nerve pain that I’ve been having for two months. It caused a light burning sensation when I took it that I also had with Lexapro, but I kept trying. I read a lot of great reviews on the effects of cymbalta. But it wasn’t for me. My doctor thinks I may have serotonin syndrome from it, and it made my anxiety worse than it was. It may be helping my depression but it is not worth it to make my anxiety even worse than it is. Some people love it. I wish it was for me.",Mdog101
4,Cymbalta,Anxiety,9.0,,"January 31, 2022",0,By far the best medication for anxiety and panic disorder. Went off of it for a few months and had paralyzing anxiety and obsessive thoughts. Would snap at my family for the slightest thing. Back on cymbalta at 30 mgs and my anxiety is 80% better and I barely have panic attacks. Unfortunately for me it causes body twitches which is why I knocked off a point. I was on it for years with no side effects but now have body twitches for the last year 1.5 years. Still way better than living with constant anxiety and panic attacks! This medication gave me my life back!,Eleni
5,Cymbalta,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 25, 2022",2,"Pray you never have to wean off this drug!!!If it works for you great, but I promise you that discontinuing is a complete nightmare that last for weeks or months.The Good: Helped with chronic knee pain and anxiety.The Bad: None of the good is worth the bad! Helped anxiety but felt like doing nothing but stare at a wall on lowest dose. Insomnia, constant headache, decreased libido, unable to focus, out of body feeling. These did not improve with time. After 3 months I decided it wasn’t worth it and started to wean off. Without a doubt the worst experience of my life, and it is still going on. 24/7 headaches, nightmares that are so real, I wake up believing they happened, unable to focus, severe vision changes, a feeling that I am not me. The doctor said these effects can last a week or many months. Obviously, I’m going to be on the wrong end of this. For those it helps, I’m very happy for you, but coming off (pray you don't) will be a nightmare that seems to never end.",Dave
6,Cymbalta,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 10, 2022",2,"I have depression, GAD and PD as well as degeneration of the disks in my spine. My DO and Psych decided to give me this instead of Lexapro to also help with nerve pain. It changed me into someone I wasn’t, made me do things I wouldn’t usually do, I had a breakdown and then a disassociave episode where I don’t remember hardly anything about an entire summer. I thought it was making me better until after I stopped it. All the mental anguish and pain came back and I also saw what it had done to me as mentioned above. It’s a horrible drug that almost ruined my life. I cried every day even while on it. It took awhile to get myself right again after stopping. 3 years later and I’m free from this terrible drug experience. Looking back it was like I was on some hard street drug or something.",Horrible drug
7,Cymbalta,Anxiety,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 7, 2022",2,"I feel compelled to write a review on my experience because my doctors were baffled by my side effects, but I've read other reviews similar to mine on this site so clearly this information needs to get out there. I was on Cymbalta 20mg a day for around 2 weeks for a few reasons; I have severe anxiety and depression, and I also have a connective tissue disease that causes some nerve pain. One night I randomly started getting a burning sensation in my chest, armpits, arms, ears and forehead that felt like hot flushing, but imagine a normal flushing sensation amplified x100. I immediately started getting severe anxiety because I've never had this sensation before. I've had panic where you feel burning in your forehead, but I've never had this deep chest burning that would radiate into the armpits and sort of move across my upper body in waves. The strange sensations continued for hours and hours into the night, and I had multiple panic attacks into the next day. My doc stopped the drug.",Amanda

My anxiety was worse than it had ever been. I stop taking it after 4 weeks of horribleness. I went back on Clonazepam 1 mg. 3 times a day.

14,Cymbalta,Anxiety,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 23, 2021",3,I had taken Cymbalta years ago and went off of it. I had been taking Baclofen 20mg for osteoporosis in my body and back spasms but taking it with Paxil and my other mental meds put me into manic episodes. I’m Bipolar and have PTSD. I’ve been on tons of mental meds that wasn’t helping me. I’ve been hospitalized 4 times for manic episodes. I had to quit taking Baclofen which is a muscle relaxer it was reacting badly with my other meds. My Dr in the psych ward put me on Cymbalta 30 mg a day. I seemed to be doing good on it but now I’m home and I’ve been on it for a month now and I feel really tired and lethargic. The last mental ward I was in added another 30mg to take at night of Cymbalta it has been helping with nerve pain and muscle spasms. I just wish I had my happy personality back and some energy back too.,Heather

I went from waking up with that feel of dread in the pit of my stomach to being completely calm in less than a month. This medication has saved my life.During the first week I experienced terrible nausea, insomnia, and headaches. These all went away by the end of week 2. Now the only side effect I experience are occasional headaches and trouble climaxing. I can work around the sexual dysfunction by timing when I have intercourse. I've found that if you have sex around 20-24 hours after taking your last dose it is much easier to achieve orgasm.",LongRod

For the first time in such a long time, I can feel life returning to normal now. I can get out of bed in the mornings now and actually look forward to going to work. I'm two weeks in now and on a 30mg dose and I am so glad that I took this leap of faith. I understand that this won't work for everyone but you must push past the initial 4 or 5 days to be able to make a solid decision. Life is good now.",Ciaran

I have dry mouth and a little insomnia so far but I'll take it if it gives me back my life.  I've had anxiety longer than I even realize, depression as well.  As of late, I've had so many negative thoughts that felt like were playing on repeat in my head no matter how hard I tried to let them go.  Almost instantly I feel like I'm back in control.

20,Cymbalta,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 3, 2021",4,I take Cymbalta for severe anxiety and chronic pain.  It lowers my anxiety level so I can cope with pain .  My anxiety made me suicidal.  I catastrophized everything and I mean everything.  What a waste of energy. Now I go with the flow. I take things in my stride. I don’t feel desperate to control every outcome.  I find it makes my hands and feet swell a bit. I guess that’s the price I will pay for a calmer life. I hope I don’t put on too much weight though.

I was having panic attacks every day at work, I would get panic attacks in my house for no reason, I’ve always had anxiety. There was just a constant wave of anxiety over me at all times. I would also get very depressed. Very down for a long time.My dr mentions cymbalta and I decided to give it a try. The first 4 days or so I felt like I had the flu I would say. I was just very tired, sleeping non stop, feeing dizzy, wasn’t hungry, felt nauseous. But after those days I felt so much better. A switch flipped. My anxiety is still there but no where near as bad. I haven’t had a panic attack for over a month I feel the start of one but I don’t get one!I haven’t had a bad depressive episode either!

I cannot believe what it has done for me. It has helped my panic attacks and my anxiety at least 50% so far it has also helped my neuropathy at least 75% it also has helped my arthritis pain from RA at least 50% in my hands. I am just amazed I do take mine in the morning and I do tend to get tired. It is now August and my doctor has upped me to 30 mg I will start tomorrow. I even have more energy and even went on a diet and I’m very proud of myself. Don’t be scared because if you have any side effects you can always stop.

After 1 year, my anxiety attacks started to return. It got so bad that my periods skipped or stopped all together due to stress. I was crying off and on all day and was paranoid from sun up to sun down. Cymbalta has already started making minor changes in my life for the better. The first few nights I suffered horrendous panic attacks, excessive sweating, and ice-in-my-veins sensations. (That also happened when I started Lexapro years ago) I can say that most side effects have subsided, with the exception of low appetite. I am focusing at work, I feel lighter and happier, and have not experienced an anxiety attack since starting the medication.

I had taken it for three days before and it constantly made me feel nauseated and sleepy.  If you lose weight on this medication, that's how. It's because you constantly feel like you're going to throw up.  I didn't take it for a while but then my anxiety started getting really bad lately, so I decided to try it again.  I took one pill last night and could not go to sleep. Then when I finally did go to sleep I woke up at 2 am feeling like I was going to puke, heart racing, scared out of my mind that I was going to die and sweating.  This might work for some people, but it didn't work well at all for me.  I will never take it again, it only made me feel worse.",Chacha

Could not get appt with PCP, who never followed up; on my own eased off the cymbalta and back to citalopram, with lorazapam for breakthrough panic attacks. Have taken this combination for years, to good effect, but doctors have become stingy with lorazapam. (This, of course, increases my anxiety.)

After the first dose, I was mostly fine. I felt nauseous, restless, and didn't sleep much that night. But I figured it was just my body adjusting to the medication. After the second dose the next morning, I was driving to work when I got a sudden very intense urge to sleep, my eyes suddenly became very sensitive to daylight, and I felt very dizzy. I ended up making it to work, but had trouble walking. My vision was very blurry, felt like my eyes were rolling uncontrollably, and I had auditory/visual distortions. I sat at my desk for almost 4 hours basically paralyzed. My heart pounded, and I had shortness of breath; I couldn't see well enough to read; I couldn't write. I had muscle spasms in my face and felt like I might choke on my tongue. After 3-4 hours, these symptoms started to go away, but lingered at a less intense level through the day. Never.

Not only did it do absolutely nothing for me (and I stuck with it for about a month and a half, patiently waiting for it to work), it led me to have tremors, extreme dizzyness and extreme dissociation. It made me feel so empty and depressed, which was concerning because I didn't feel that way before I was placed on it. The medicine also made me very irritable and gave me very violent thoughts which absolutely scared the poop out of me. My face swelled up terribly  as well which was the final straw that led me to stop taking it ASAP. When I finally was able to see a psychiatrist and I told her my experience with the medicine, she told me that Cymbalta is a very tricky med and most people don't react well with it.

I was a bit more anxious those first couple of days but it got a little better and I feel SO much better. I’ve tired Zoloft which made my anxiety worse, then Citalipram which didn’t really do much of anything except make me restless and jittery but Cymbalta is finally the right one. I feel like a normal person for the first time in a long time. My piece of advice, I see a lot of people on here saying that they’ve felt miserable for 3-4 weeks, even a month +.

I am sharing this not because I want to discourage anyone with similar disorders like GAD or depression not to try it, but to emphasize a possibility of unbearable side effects for some people. This medication might work amazingly for some people, but please bear in mind that some SSRI/SNRI might fit our genetics and some don't. If one doesn't work for you, you could discuss it with your doctor and try another one until you find the most suitable one for you. This is science.

I was happy to double the dose to 60mg because it was supposed to help with my chronic pain. It did not. If anything it made the pain worse. Worse than the pain was the diarrhea- up to 50 times a day often with no control. I was told it was not a side effect and would go away. I was so sick that I didn't question it and just tried to get through it. Weeks later, totally exhausted and unable to sleep well, a friend checked it out and saw that diarrhea could be a side effect. I halved the dose and the diarrhea immediately improved.

I recently started having panic attacks and couldn’t seem to focus at all. I talked to my dr about switching meds, they decided that moving to 60mg would help my anxiety more. I took 60 mg for about a week and was having so many more muscle spasms. I also had headaches everyday. I felt all over the place. So I went to my dr again saying  I thought I need  something else. I will start taking Wellbutrin. I really hope this is going to be the medicine for me. My anxiety is out of control right now coming off cymbalta. I also am having a ton of dizziness.",Kelsey

Never had this hot sensation in my chest before. Second week felt a little better for two days then boom hot flushes again throwing me into another panic attack. This one milder than previous week.

Starting on 30mg I moved up to 60mg after a week and stayed on that for a year or so. It completely cured my anxiety and helped me sleep.  Side effects were -difficult to hold on to pee, constipation and tiredness. Also bad night sweats.  This dose was great for my anxiety but it didn’t keep the migraines at bay so I was still getting flare ups about 3 times a week so was upped to 90mg but within 3 months I was back to 2/3 migraines a week. So up again to 120mg. On this dose I had no emotion; I couldn’t cry or feel sadness or happiness. I just felt numb and weary.  But no migraines! The side effects are too much so I’m back down to 90mg. Migraine is just under the surface and breaks through 1/2 times weekly. The plan is to reduce Duloxetine so my anxiety is under control and then add in another med to deal with the migraine. I would recommend this drug for anxiety but not quite so good for migraine so it was a compromise.",Jaciakky

Nothing before this touched my anxiety and I was housebound for 10 years. The positives are my anxiety has gone from a 10 down to at least a 6/5depression from a 10 down to a 7/6.I can orgasm - on other meds can cause issuesThe negatives - The withdrawal is REAL (try not to miss a dose), constipation,my body metabolizes this medication fast. I have to take an extra 20 mg dose in the morning. When I was just on the 60 in the evening I'd get bad brain zaps/dizziness.The biggest downside to this med is getting off of it. If you need to come off it taper as slow as you can and ask to go on Prozac which can really help with withdrawal. I recommend giving this med a try for anxiety. It's the only thing to help me. If you have depression alone I'd try something else first like Prozac or Wellbutrin as they are really easy to come off if they don't work for you.",SJ

Had to reduce my citalopram before going on to duloxetine/cymbalta 30mg.  The Citalopram withdrawal was 20mg a day for 2 weeks then 20mg every second day then 2 days of nothing then start taking 30mg duloxetine every night. I have been on it now for 2 weeks and have noticed a little difference because it can take a few weeks for full effect to kick in. Withdrawal symptoms from citalopram were not nice at all. Maybe the reduction was too quick. I ended up in hospital for few days which did me good. I have been out of hospital for week but been on duloxetine 30mg for about 2 weeks so I know I have to wait a bit longer for full effect to take place. I still get a bit anxious etc but things are slightly improving. I hope in another couple weeks I will notice even more of a difference.

Dr gave me .25mg xanax 3x a day & 30mg Duloxetine 1x a day. Dr said I could start with 60 but I felt that was to high to start. I've only taken 1 dose of the xanax Friday.

I had a slight dry mouth & some slight dizziness by 8:30 PM. But I actually feel pretty good. At tolerable anxiety level. Is it possible that 1 dose of Cymbalta actually made my anxiety start to dissipate already? Or maybe my body just eventually kicks out the anxiety like it has in the past & I don't need meds.

Though Latuda is more for Bi-Polar, it has helped many people with PTSD, like myself. I have no weight gain and I have plenty of stamina to do my running. I'm so grateful to God and my doctor for finding the best program for me. If you're an athlete, help is out there.",SoCalPhilly

I do suffer from anxiety and in addition to that I have herniated discs and problems in my neck. This medicine has been the greatest thing I have ever taken. Finally I can go to grocery stores alone and not have panic attacks in the middle of walmart. So my anxiety has greatly improved. The tingling and dizziness I would get in my head and arms is gone. My neck pain has improved but it could get even better if I could increase my dose to 60 mg. But my blood pressure is at times is too high. Once this is under control they will increase cymbalta. I have had no side affects at all on this medication and feel like I can live again. Mood has improved and I feel like myself again.,Shuna

I'm not sure if I can go up from here but even if I don't, the way I feel now is better than anything else I have tried including prozac, lexapro, welbutrin and several others. I do have some dry mouth and sweating but it is tolerable.",Anonymous
283,Cymbalta,Anxiety,8.0,,"June 20, 2008",111,I was on Cymbalta for two years.  I had no side effects and it worked really well for my anxiety.  I had no sexual side effects which was great.  I decided to go off of it thinking that I didn't need it anymore.  I thought that I tapered it by taking 20mg for a month.  Once I started taking 20mg every other day it was like experiencing the withdrawal symptoms over again each time.  I finally just stopped taking it and had awful withdrawal symptoms.- more monitoring would have helped.,Anonymous

285,Cymbalta,Anxiety,10.0,,"February 27, 2008",191,"I have been on this medication for 1.5yrs & it has been GREAT! Was on Paxil for 3 yrs prior to switching to Cymbalta. It worked in about 3 days and i havent had any abnormal feelings of anxiety since I started this med. I haven't had any side effects from taking it. I had experienced some weight gain from Paxil, but none on Cymbalta. The only thing is that if you miss a dose, your terrible headache will remind u that u forgot to take it! Other than that, it's been great.",Anonymous

I have not felt this good in years. the first 2 weeks I did have a lot of side effects swetting, dizziness, insomnea, upset stomach, but after that I started feeling better. I have lost 20 lbs because I no longer feel hunger all the time. I feel like I did 20 years ago so much happier. I can't rave enough about it.",Kath E
287,Cymbalta,Anxiety,,,"November 18, 2007",129,"I'm 29 & been on Cymbalta 1 week, prior to taking, couldnt sleep (4 hrs on average), panic attacks, acne break outs, hair falling out, highly stressed, now a little disoriented at times, loss of appetite (not a bad thing), great sleep(much needed) and Im much calmer. The doctor wants to add Wellbutrin in 30 days but I am not going that route. I am very pleased with the direction we are going in now it is just taking some time to adjust to the side effects and new routine of actually resting!!",xxoolostooxx
