0,Buspar,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 1, 2022",1,"This medication has changed my life. I had crippling anxiety, and kept having antidepressants prescribed to me which I refused to take. After a couple weeks on Buspar, my life got exponentially better. I’m so grateful to have found this medication.",HighlyReccomend
1,Buspar,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 1, 2022",0,"After cycling through (in order) Prozac, Prozac + Celexa, Prozac + Xanax, Prozac + Abilify, Lexapro, Lexapro + Xanax, Lexapro + Klonopin, Effexor + Klonopin, Wellbutrin + Klonopin to treat an anxiety disorder and panic attacks, I found Buspar. I don't know how it works, but it does. It makes me calm, able to think clearly, and feel like myself. It isn't sedating and doesn't cause sleepiness; it's just calming. I still have anxious energy, but it slows my thoughts and allows me to be more present. I'm not sure of its precise mechanism of action, but it worked right away for me.",V_Redmond
2,Buspar,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2022",0,"After years of being treated with an array of new breakthrough drugs for Bipolar 2, which all were miserable with the side-effects. Anti-depressants we’re not working because it leads to more manic-depressive cycles for Bipolar patients. For years, programmed into a Big Pharma drone on Adderall and Xanax to treat my swings in mood/energy, but never feeling any sense of internal happiness or mental growth. Buspar and Carbamazepine were the two drugs that pulled me out of this dark hole. Lithium too had led to physical degeneration and my mood was still not getting better after a year (dry mouth, lazy). I was on Carbamazepine for 3 months and feeling better however I realized I was often still on edge. With Carbamazepine alone I was no longer angry about small things, but I still felt off. Buspar completely provided me the peace of mind I needed to move forward in life and allowed small things to roll off of my back. I felt positive changes on Day 1.",Mr. BPD2
3,Buspar,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2022",0,Went from heart palpitations and rocking in a chair to normal in two doses. I know benzos seem alluring for their fast acting relief but they aren’t worth the much much much worse side effects. I can’t believe it took this long for me to be prescribed this drug. I hope it continues to get better. Time to sleep more than 6 hours again for the first time in months. Saved my life. Sometimes it takes longer. I had some strange thoughts after the first dose you might too but fight through them and it will be worth it. I’m excited for life again. People with CHS should try this when getting off cannabis.,Fast for me
4,Buspar,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 6, 2022",1,"Buspirone saved my life! Several times in the past years. It's a life saver and life changer. I was terrified to start taking it at first due to the horrible reviews I would read, but everyone's different. And I really needed help with my severe anxiety/panic attacks so I started taking it and hoped for the best. It was the best decision I've made. I started taking 7.5mg twice a day and felt the difference the next day,  taking 15mg twice a day when needed to. I had mild side effects for the first week, headaches, tiredness, vivid dreams, but all tolerable. The first 3 days being the worst but went away. Within the first week I felt so much better, and just got better after that. Felt more calm, less anxiety, no overthinking, no more intrusive thoughts, better sleep and its not habit forming which is a plus for me. It really works, I recommend it if you really want to help yourself. Don't be scared of the side affects or reviews and push thru it. It really works. I'm so thankful for it.",Jackie.M
5,Buspar,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2022",2,"I started taking this medication after taking Mirtazapine (increased weight gain but worked well for sleep), Wellbutrin (increased my anxiety immensely), and Xanax. I don’t think anything works quite as well as Xanax for panic attacks (and I still have to take it when I feel them coming on) but Buspar really helped control my GAD. I went from having intrusive thoughts looping inside my head, increased heart rate, changes in body temperature, and feeling constantly on the edge to being able to get through the day without the sense of impending doom. I still have anxiety, but it doesn’t feel like the end of the world anymore and I have been able to get my life back. Some side effects- dizziness after first taking it and brain zaps for the first few weeks, but very little compared to others. I started with 5mg and now take 15mg broken apart through the day. With meditation, exercise, talk therapy, healthier foods and this medication, I finally have my life back.",GAD and Panic
6,Buspar,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2022",2,Horrible! I was stated on 14 mg a day. At first it was okay. I’m like I can work through the side effects. Then bam!!!! I felt weird one night. Like dizzy and like I couldn’t sit up straight. I just wanted to lay in bed but I was at work with a 20 min car ride home!!! So I drank lots of water and I was able to function. On the drive home it was rainy and every puddle I hit I thought it was going to spin off the road. I got home then started worrying about rent so much. I almost cried. It was horrible!!! I have never had such a bad panic attack. It’s the day after and I still feel like I am having it but not as bad. I had to take a hydroxyzine to help bring me down from it.My advice? Don’t get too comfortable with it.,Teetzy81
7,Buspar,Anxiety,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 22, 2022",2,"I could never take more than 10 mg at once without dizziness and nausea that would surprisingly last approx. 30 minutes to an hour. Even 5 mg would sometimes cause dizziness. I was supposed to take 15mg (?) mg twice a day but I would take less than my prescription because of the dizziness. It was really frustrating and I'm not sure if buspar helped my anxiety. Being off of it, I still don't have as many panic attacks and as much anxiety as I used to. I thought that the decrease in panic attacks and anxiety was due to taking the buspar, but now I'm not sure. I was very unhappy with this medicine because the dizziness after taking it always happened even though I was on it and taking it consistently for quite a long time.",jjj
8,Buspar,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 18, 2022",0,"overthinking/paranoia is one of Borderline Personality Disorder (bpd)  is core criteria’s. I had terrible dissociative episodes of pure paranoia leading onto aggressive rage for years. I’ve tried SSRI’s since I was 14 and none had worked, and now that I’ve tried buspirone things have changed for me. I handle life and my issues so much better than I used to. It’s easier for me to rationalize and I feel more on the peaceful side for once. Not a miracle worker obviously, but definitely a big help for me",sabey
9,Buspar,Anxiety,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 17, 2022",4,"I tried this med at dosages ranging from 10mg to 45 mg a day for about six months. I did not notice any real change in my anxiety levels and the side effects were disturbing. I got brain zaps, plus it aggravated my restless leg syndrome and seemed to prevent me from ever falling asleep all the way. My psych spoke highly of this med so I know it works for a lot of people. Just not for me. I ended up switching to Xanax and gabapentin, which is better.",Rella
10,Buspar,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 15, 2022",4,"I started this drug at 10 mg TID after being on Wellbutrin for 2 years for anxiety and losing effectiveness. I felt fine the first two days but on day three I felt very nauseous, dizzy, loss of appetite, and just overall ""off"". On the fourth day I had the worst panic attack I've ever had and I haven't had a panic attack in over 5 years. I had full body tremors, palpitations, confusion/difficulty concentration, unable to focus, photophobia for over 3 hours following the attack and it happened again the next morning after I hadn't taken the drug in over 12 hours.

12,Buspar,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 9, 2022",6,"Unfortunately, nothing works for my anxiety except benzodiazepines but those are controlled and have a bad rep for being abused and sold on the streets. So now I’m on Vraylar, Pristiq, Wellbutrin, Trileptal, buspar and gabapentin instead of just benzos. I’m on expensive maintenance drugs which have caused me to gain weight, get acne, develop tremors, brain zaps, headaches and nausea. Thanks doc for drugging me up really good.",Rob
13,Buspar,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2022",44,"Buspar (Buspirone) has been pretty good for me. I've been on pretty much everything and even abused various street drugs before. Of the prescription drugs I've read a lot of seemingly potential addicts give Buspar 1s in reviewing it because it's not Xanax. You're right, it's not, but that doesn't discount it for some of us it works for. I've been on Xanax, and it is stronger, but also has way more side effects including brain fog, sometimes drowsy, and definitely has that pull towards it in an addicting way (I've been addicted to many things). Buspar is okay at treating anxiety and sometimes okay is good and, if I miss a dose of Buspar, I honestly don't think ""OMG, I need my dose!"" It's seemingly no big deal if you do and your body and mind don't seem to crave it as much. Sure, it feels good to feel good as drugs can do for you but sometimes you just want to live and not be a slave to medicine. Because some reviewers were tweaking for Xanax doesn't merit giving Buspar a 1, it works.",Chuck
14,Buspar,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 22, 2021",2,"I get things done on this med and don’t need Ritalin. It’s amazing how many side projects were getting completed! I also was more social. I stopped Buspar due to it making my sleep problems even worse, and I could not afford that. I picked it up 1 1/2 years later and it made me really angry and down and sleep problems picked up again. I’m going through menopause so I suspect that has something to do with the negative moods, so I’ve decided to set it aside again and hope I can find something else to get me through. I did like my productivity on this med though!",Carolyn
15,Buspar,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 23, 2021",11,"Takes 4-6 weeks to work and about 2-3 months to get the full effect, but it works and I highly recommend. I started off 5mg 2x a day and increased it to 30mg (15x2). However, the 15mg dose makes me dizzy at times so changed to 15mg at night (before bed) and 10mg a few hours after lunch.  I find the dizziness increases when you take it with food, especially sugary foods (I take it on an empty stomach).  Bottom line: this stuff works really well for GAD. I no longer worry or fear.  It turns off your fear response and lets you live.  If it did not give me the dizziness (which lasts about 1 hour sometimes) it would be 10/10. Not a substitute for Xanax (I still take .5mg at night), but I have been able to lower Xanax use and control anxiety very well.  Buspar is a MUST for those with GAD.  Just start off low (5mg x2) and work your way up. Do not be afraid it! I would think most people with GAD will respond well with 20 to 30 mg a day. Also, for those with tinnitus, it does not affect it.",Rob
16,Buspar,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 15, 2021",6,"I had a prior negative experience with Buspar because it interacted with Zoloft. After getting off Zoloft I decided to give Buspar another try and I’m so glad I did. I’m only taking 7.5 mg daily and its made an incredible difference in only a week. I’m less aggressive less agitated and annoyed by minor things. I have more patience, feel calmer and at ease. I’m enjoying reading books again and have a much more positive outlook. I have a very sensitive system so my tiny dose that works for me might not work for another. It’s important to get the correct dose for YOU.",Jacob
17,Buspar,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2021",7,"For a few weeks, I’ve been dealing with really bothersome anxiety attacks that happen in all sorts of situations. Everything in my life sort of just stacked up and overwhelmed me. I have all sorts of tools I’ve learned from psychotherapy, but I was still getting overwhelmed. This is topped off with sleep problems and related worrying.After a single pill, the difference is significant. It feels like someone turned the volume down on my physical symptoms. The racing, unhelpful thoughts are still there, but I’m much more easily able to redirect them or use meditation to pull myself back to the present moment. Hopefully, this anxiety subsides once I sort things out and I can eventually wean off. For now, Buspar seems like it’s going to be really helpful.",Grateful
18,Buspar,Anxiety,1.0,,"October 7, 2021",6,"First and second low dose of Buspar have resulted in tingling inside my hands and face, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations.

21,Buspar,Anxiety,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 23, 2021",2,Recently got back on meds for anxiety attacks. I hadn't had anxiety attacks for a few years now they are back for some reason. Anyway Buspar is okay its nowhere near as helpful as xanax. It does calm me but makes me lightheaded and sleepy as anything . The doc started me on 10mg. Side effects are pretty strong for me which sucks because I  have to be able to drive a lot and talk to customers all day.,slamfire

23,Buspar,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 20, 2021",8,"This medication  was a total nightmare for me. I went from having generalized anxiety, to after taking it for about a week, to having MAJOR panic and anxiety 24/7, sleeplessness, moodiness - it was terrible. I had to stop taking after 2 weeks.

I genuinely wish there was a non narcotic that would just cure anxiety but I'm not sure there is right now. I'm going to ask my doctor to try something new with the Xanax but I've tried most everything. Might try some therapy and meditation.,Dustin
27,Buspar,Anxiety,9.0,,"August 9, 2021",22,"I suffer from moderate social anxiety and severe GAD. I have struggled for YEARS & have tried just about any SSRI and SNRI that is on the market and none of them worked for me. My doctor finally decided to try this. I work in a pharmacy & see very few patients that take this drug so I never really thought much of it. She started me at 15mg 2X a day. I’ve been on it for a few months now and I’ve increased my dose to 30mg 2X daily and the WORLD of difference that this drug has made is life changing. I used to get so upset, angry, & overwhelmed over the smallest things so suddenly & have panic attacks, I could never shut off my brain, this had changed my life. Just like any other drug it may work for me & not for others.

31,Buspar,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 1, 2021",10,"I was afraid to try something new. So afraid I had this RX for a month before trying it. I felt it instantly, starting at 5mg a day for 1.5 weeks. I got headaches the first week and mild dizziness within and ending the 1st 30 minutes. I felt irritated and like it wasn’t working. My psychiatrist moved me to 2-5 mg and the 3-5 mg a day. By week 2 I felt better about driving again and went into a store for the first time in a while. I just hit week 3 and will move to 10 mg in the am, 5 mg at lunch and 5 mg around 3 or I have trouble going to sleep. It has been working well and hopefully will continue to work.

33,Buspar,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 21, 2021",235,"After reading some of these reviews I was terrified to start taking buspirone. I've had pretty severe anxiety for the last year and I've previously tried Zoloft (terrible) and clonazepam (works but puts me straight to sleep, so doesn't work for most daytime/work situations).I started on 5mg and took it at night. I woke up the next morning after some pretty crazy dreams and my brain fog was completely gone. I felt calm. It's been 7 days so far and I finally feel like my old self again. There have been some side effects - mostly nausea, lightheadedness/dizziness but super mild and honestly compared to those same side effects that I have from anxiety they are bearable. I would definitely recommend this medication! It's changed my life. I was starting to think I would never feel normal again. Most important is to remember that not every medication works with every body. If this doesn't work there are other options out there! Don't despair.",Thankful
34,Buspar,Anxiety,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 18, 2021",127,"This drug takes weeks to reach an effect. It sounds like from reading the posts most are not giving it  enough time to work. Buspar also has almost no side effects  for me compared to other drugs. Remember these drugs rewire the way the chemicals in your brain work, it definitely going to make you feel weird but at least give it the time needed to reach the therapeutic effect, 4-6 weeks. If you can handle anxiety for over 5-10-15 years you can hold up for another 3-6 weeks. I’m pulling into the end of week 2 and don’t see a huge difference yet but I know that if it don’t work after the allotted time I can then change it.",Stevo

I can get nervous about new meds; I have had some bad experiences. My doc said I could take it daily, or as needed. The first night I took it, I felt like it helped me sleep. After that, for five to seven days, I felt as though I was taking nothing. Then WHAM!!!! Suddenly I was losing hours and days at a time. Disassociating. Hallucinating.  My employer voiced concern for my mental health and asked me to take time off. I was completely off buspar for over a week before I felt even remotely like myself again. What I experienced while taking this medication and for a week after getting off of it, completely was a nightmare!!

But I take it as needed mostly. It works! For the past few days I have truly suffered with terrible anxiety attack related to over thinking mostly about traveling.

So if you are someone who keeps freezing and can't get anything done not matter how much you want to, this is a great choice.I like Buspar since it is different than other anti-anxiety meds, most anti-anxiety meds are SSRIs like Prozac (caused 35lb weight gain and destroyed libido during the time I took it) or benzodiazepines (which are highly addictive with terrible withdrawal and should only be taken at most 4 consecutive months or on an as needed basis).Eventually I stopped taking Buspar because of extreme daytime drowsiness.

I also started to get jaw stiffness and ear popping but I’ve read that side effects would eventually subside, so I decided to stick with it. It started working at 3 weeks and my anxiety had been noticeably decreased. By the 4th week though, my sleep started to get worse and I couldn’t sleep through the night. While my anxiety was low, my mind also felt very foggy and slow and that was ratcheting my anxiety even more.Stopped taking it almost 3 weeks ago and there were definitely withdrawal symptoms despite what my PCP said.

Everything has been fine since. I can even have margaritas etc again. (But I can't stress enough how scary and extreme that sickness was in the beginning, so drinkers BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL.)My family says they have never seen me so happy in all my 46 yrs. I am sure that I've never had such an easy going attitude. Things I used to take personally have no effect on me now. I take two 5mg tabs at night before bed.

It was prescribed several years ago for anxiety to cope with an upcoming surgery- and health risks associated with it. Prior to Buspar, I had never taken any depression medicine nor struggled with extreme anxiety. And I exercised often and was not taking medicine for any other health issue. Buspar sent me into a horrible, deep pit of despair, unlike I had ever known, or could even imagine anyone having. The doctor kept telling me it would take awhile to work, but after two weeks, Buspar never did. I got off of it and, while still anxious about surgery, had no more extreme depression. The despair, caused by Buspar was far worse than the surgery. If I had to choose, I would gladly have that surgery again rather than take another round of Buspar.

I started taking Buspar about 3.5 years ago and the first thing I noticed was sleepiness. But other than that, no side effects. It took a while to start working, but when it did, I was finally able to feel relaxed in public. The biggest thing is that it sedates the body. It makes me less reactive and slows down my mind.

Dr. put me on Buspar 10mg twice a day.  I was also on Prozac 20 mg once a day and Clonopin 0.5mg once at night for years and felt just fine.  The Buspar made me spacey and did not help the anxiety.  They reduced it to 5mg twice a day.  Still a little spacey and did not help anxiety.  Upped my Clonopin to an extra 0.5mg in morning and 0.25mg in afternoon.  Buspar is not helping.  Going to ask my doctor to change to something else.  Been on it almost a couple of months.  Any help anyone can give me?  Thanks so much.

Also caused extreme dizziness that I had a hard time functioning with.

I took this pill everyday for about 4 days and felt fine but then one day after I took it, I was so dizzy, I could barely stand up and then I felt nauseous all day long. It was not fun.

I decided to try the Buspar to help with the anxiety using 2 X 10mg per day and it works wonders.  At first the side effects made me cry for nothing but after 1 week everything got resolved and I see the benefits.  No real side effects for me since I use Seroquel which is much stronger on the side effects.  What I see is that I can have dreams again which didn't happen for for the last 20 years and a lot less anxiety.  Less closing of the hands reflects, calm, no social phobia, or performance anxiety.  It is working very well for me and now I need to do more with my life since I have the capacity.  Thanks",Anonymous

In fact the only thing I feel is that I am thinking positively, rather than looking for a boogey-man in everything. Just a natural feeling of health. Recently the doctor tried something else because of poor sleep and gave me lorazepam, which made my arms and legs feel heavy and I slept for 12 hours, and then diazepam which did nothing much but dampened my feelings and sleep was worse.
