0,Prochlorperazine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 6, 2022",0,"Compazine (prochlorperazine):Be very cautious of this medicine. I went to the ER for a bad migraine and they gave me this in a ""migraine cocktail"". Words cannot describe how bad it made me feel. I had an extreme feeling of restlessness, I absolutely could not sit still nor get comfortable. I had an intense feeling of ""I have to get out of here"", and it filled me with absolute rage. I ended up doing things like rocking back and forth, constantly tensing every muscle in my body because I felt so restless, and even ended up hitting myself in the head pretty hard multiple times out of anger. This was completely out of character for meI thought I was just crazy and had a bad reaction that was really uncommon. The stories here are no exaggeration, this ""medicine"" really is that horrible. It should absolutely be banned",Zuriel
1,Prochlorperazine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 7, 2022",1,Compazine (prochlorperazine):I have been to the ER twice for severe nausea and vomiting due to anxiety and the first time they administered compazine with Ativan and it worked wonders. The second time they had just administered compazine and I noticed it really does help with nausea along with anxiety induced nausea but without the side effects of benzos. After that my I asked my PCP if I can have a prescription of the 10 mg tablets and now I take it either if I’m very nauseous and Zofran doesn’t work (I don’t want to build a tolerance to comp.) or if I’m feeling down with anxiety due to MDD because it helps lifts my mood and makes my heart feel at ease especially for the next day. I don’t recommend taking compazine if you have never took an antidepressant or if you don’t have anxiety/depression due to the nasty mental effects an antipsychotic can do.,Alex

3,Prochlorperazine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 31, 2021",0,"Compazine (prochlorperazine):About a year ago or so, I went to the hospital for a migraine. I've gone fairly often for migraines. Normally its benadryl, and some fluids (from dehydration) and then I'm good to go. This time they gave me benadryl and compazine. Almost immediately  I started panicking. My heart was racing, jt was hard to breathe, and I literally thought I was dying. I was in the process of trying to text my loved ones telling them I loved them. Thanks to covid, my husband wasn't allowed in, however my attack had gotten so bad I begged and pleaded for them to let him in with me. The nurse who administered the medicine didn't care that I was freaking out, in fact all she had said was ""well, your headache is gone now right? Now you have a new problem"". If I could sue the hospital for this and win, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I thought I was dying and the nurse just shrugged and said ""oh well now you have a new problem"". A year later and I'm still not normal. Panic attacks are worse and often:/",123littlered

5,Prochlorperazine,Anxiety,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 27, 2021",0,"Compazine (prochlorperazine):Got it for the first time ever, went in for a headache that was persistent. Have had panic and anxiety attacks before so I knew what was happening. 15 minutes in I was going crazy. Akathisia was what took the longest to go away. I read compazine takes 2-4 days to get out of the body if taken through IV. So don’t worry y’all you will get better but give it the minimum days. Benadryl does help as it’s a counter for it. Mother is allergic to it as well and reglan. They say it’s not hereditary but I believe it is. Careful with these headaches drugs! Even though the headache did go away! 24 hours have passed since taking it and in slowly coming off the side effects",Anonymous
6,Prochlorperazine,Anxiety,1.0,,"September 13, 2021",1,"Compazine (prochlorperazine):I went into the emergency center for a migraine. I have anxiety disorder and bipolar disorder. I was given this in an i.v. and they turned off the light once they left. Within five minutes, I had this horrible rush of anxiety. I immediately sat up, ran to mirror and started to breathe. For some reason when I watch myself doing the breathing exercises for anxiety it helps me believe that it's a phase and it will pass. After 10 reps I took the i.v.off of the stand and ran into the bathroom. Then I ran down the hallway and told someone to get this i.v. out of my arm right now. The nurse asked me to go to my room. I started to rip our the i.v.and she immediately stopped me and came to remove it herself. I had to go outside for 20 minutes to remove my mask so that I wouldn't hyperventilate. I was curious about this experience and I wound up here. Needless to say, I'm not alone. I would never ever get this drug again!",Toni
7,Prochlorperazine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 2, 2021",0,"I had three days of severe dizziness for three days and had to phone 000 for an ambulance. The Doctor diagnosed vertigo and I was given an injection of prochlorperazine. Straight away I had sweats, panic, tremors and just couldn't wait to get home. I was given a prescription for nine days tablets of the same which I took as it was getting rid of the vertigo. My G.P. then gave me a month more. It is only now on reflection that I realize I had none of these awful effects before the vertigo . I have been left with internal tremors which my Doctors have prescribed a low dose of a blood pressure tablet which would you believe has a side effect of dizziness!!! I won't be taking those! One tip...I have found that a drink of wine stops the fluttering and makes me calm....not to excess but I'll rely on that and hope it will subside over time. I'll be careful never to be given prochlorperazine ever again. Reading these reviews has reassured me that it was that terrible drug.",Julia
8,Prochlorperazine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 26, 2021",1,Compazine (prochlorperazine):This by far the worst drug ever! I was given this drug in the ER for a headache I had for over a week due to high blood pressure. It’s been over 36 hours since they gave me compazine & Benadryl and I’m still not 100% normal. I’m just ready to get back to my normal routine with my family. This drug sucks,Itsme
9,Prochlorperazine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 17, 2021",2,Compazine (prochlorperazine):DO NOT TAKE!!!!  I was actually given this for chest pain. I could have clawed my own skin off and was so annoyed by  everyone. Complete psychosis. It took 48 hours to wear off and about ten doses of benadryl.  Absolute worst experience ever. Dr acted like it was no big deal and the nurse said most everyone has a bad reaction to it. I ask why they would anyone give this drug. Certainly didn’t help my chest pain. Dumb dumb dumb,Jacob
10,Prochlorperazine,Anxiety,1.0,,"August 6, 2021",1,"Compazine (prochlorperazine):I went to ER yesterday for a migraine. Was given compazine. It gave me the worst panic attack of my life. I couldn’t stop moving.  I felt like I needed to tear the skin off my body. I was screaming. I wanted to rip out my IV & blood pressure cuff. Struggling to maintain control of my body/thoughts, I lied and told them the headache was gone and to discharge me immediately or I would leave on my own. Told nurse I wasn’t ok. She said the compazine does that sometimes, but it will pass. It didn’t pass. It hasn’t passed. I have never felt so uncomfortable. Today, I feel like my skin is crawling. I can’t sit still, can’t sleep, lay down. I can’t focus, and every part of my body just feels off. I’ve been desperately calling any medical professional I can think of to get help/relief. I refuse to go back to the ER. I would take a severe migraine any day over how I’m feeling right now. I already suffer from depression and anxiety, and this has thrown me into a tailspin.",Anonymous

12,Prochlorperazine,Anxiety,2.0,,"July 13, 2021",0,"Compazine (prochlorperazine):Went to ER for a headache that wouldn’t go away after a little over a week. Have never had migraines but apparently that’s what the ER doctors thought I had because they gave me a migraine cocktail consisting of compazine, diphenhydramine, and methylprednisolone. After getting the compazine through an IV push I genuinely thought I was having an allergic reaction. My throat felt tight and my skin felt hot and panic set in. But after the benadryl kicked in I fell asleep. I woke up with anxiety and realized the allergic reaction I had was actually a panic attack. I went for a CT scan after and it was a scary experience being in that tight space with all the residual anxiety I had. The next day I had insomnia and experienced depersonalization for the first time in years. Very scary, lots of blurred vision and generalized anxiety. 48 hours later and along with the anxiety, a weird side effect of excessive drooling and saliva. Great I know. Along with a blank stare.",Anonymous

I went to have surgery and was given this medicine which I had a bad reaction to and let me to stop breathing and stopped my heart. I was pronounced dead for 3 minutes.  Luckily they were able to bring me back and all the doctors or nurses had a big scare that day. I am lucky to still be here along with my two children who are now 25 and 28.,PatiW

She put Compazine in my IV and I immediately sat up and screamed ""What did you give me??"" I was literally crawling out of my skin and started with this full body restless leg thing and could not stop moving.  Which was horrible because I had JUST come out of surgery and had multiple abdominal incisions.  It went on for hours, sleep was out of the question and they didn't bother to speak with the Pharmacy to see if there was something that could reverse it or alleviate the symptoms.  The resident was like ""Gee- Not sure what that's all about"".  I later told my PCP and she immediately listed it as an allergy in my chart. Never. Ever. Again.",AmyNicki

I went to ER for dizziness and chest pains. The Dr. said she was going to give me something for anxiety. The nurse came in and gave me Compazine through IV she forced really fast so she could send me X-ray on my chest. She left out within a matter of seconds I felt a wave of heat in body. I started taking the IV out and blood pressure cuff off.  I ran to the restroom looking for a window to jump out of a window. I started yelling calling the nurse and ask what did you do to me.

I’m angry that anxiety is documented in my charts and they didn’t warn me of side effects. I have severe medical trauma already.

I was on all fours on the ER bed, rocking, crying, hitting the call light like my life depended on it. For what felt like hours, I waited. And my poor boyfriend watched in horror. I sobbed, I begged him to get me out of there. I remember what last shred of sanity I felt as I looked at my IV and began to mentally disassemble it, thinking how I'd get it out of me. I wanted to run. I wanted to die on the floor. Finally, the nurse came. All I gasped was 'I'm falling apart, I can't breathe. Please help!'. I was given IV Ativan.

26,Prochlorperazine,Anxiety,1.0,,"September 4, 2020",25,"Compazine (prochlorperazine):I went to the ER 4 days ago with what was assumed to be a horrible migraine. I’ve had them since I was 12 but had never had anything like this. When I got there the dr was very cold and dismissive when I was terrified. Long story short, she said she was going to order me to get toradol, Benadryl, and Compazine (the migraine concoction). I have had toradol before and everyone has had Benadryl so I wasn’t concerned. It took forever for me to get it and within less than I minute I felt like I was having a heart attack. I do have panic disorder but this was different, I started sweating profusely, I was nauseous, my heart rate and my blood pressure skyrocketed, I felt that I was trying to come out of my own skin and there was zero way to make it stop.

I had experience this before with other drugs so I knew it was going to wear off but those first 10 hours were the worst I have ever felt.

Please ask what you will be given and ask for the side effects. You can even look them up yourself before they administer it to you. Stay away from antipsychotics when you don’t need them!",Ashley

I took off my blood pressure cuff. My heart monitor & I would have ripped that IV out too. I attributed it to my panic attacks I get occasionally. My husband kept saying I bet it’s the medications. Well. The new nurse comes in and knew what was wrong with me. Saying it can cause uneasiness in people. I am now suffering PTSD. Severe panic of ending up in the hospital for what’s wrong with me. I have been up and down all day even though my body is exhausted. I can not believe this many people have had the same experiences.,Luna

He said, oh I’ve seen people run out of here on this stuff. Then why would you give it to anyone??? He gave me a big dose of Benadryl and it did help but I had to walk for hours. Strangely Raglan does the same thing to me. I’ve taken Phenergan for years and had no problem until 2 months ago and now it does the same thing. Anyone experience this with these drugs? For someone with chronic migraines with nausea this is a problem. So far zofran seems to be ok but this is one of the scariest feelings. You literally want to die and can’t stop moving.

Had to ask cars to reverse to let me out.  It's like sheer doom would hit you from out of nowhere.

Delayed allergic reaction that had to be reversed with benadryl via IV.  I swear, I hope to NEVER come across another medication with side effects like compazine.

I will try and best explain how it made me feel: I have never been so afraid in all my life. I felt like I was going to die and my mom had to keep telling me I was ok. My heart rate shot way up and I felt like I was coming out of my skin and being buried alive all while not being able to move .I felt like I couldn’t breathe like something was suffocating me.  I kept asking my mom to pray for me right then and there because I didn’t want to die but was certain I was going to. I didn’t want them to give me anything else because I was so fearful for my life.
