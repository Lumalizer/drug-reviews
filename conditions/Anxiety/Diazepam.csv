Belief led to tolerance or perhaps ineffectiveness caused by outside factors.After switching from Diazepam (TEVA) (7/10 score) to Clonazepam 2mg (TEVA) with the same and zero effectiveness I gave the one benzo I never enjoyed a try again Lorazepam (something Sun pharm.) same experience - mild to no effect / sugar type taste with a need or want to take more - which don't do anything.)I switched to 1mg Alprazolam - after taking 2 mg and nothing / something became clear / all of these have lost effectiveness - the medication has changed / and I'm not the only one finding blog after reviews.Decrease effectiveness, withdrawal symptoms, no active effects known.

This drug is a life saver for me. Have taken 5mg when needed (not every day) for over 20 years. Helps my insomnia. I’m lucky, my GP prescribes it to me. Makes me so angry that it gets such a bad press and many GP’s won’t prescribe it.

I take 10 mg tablet 3x a day and it controls my anxiety very well. It's not perfect, but really, what is? I've been on Klonopin, Xanax and Ativan in the past and Valium is by far the most subtle, yet relaxing benzodiazepine I've ever had. Truly helps me with overwhelming social and generalized anxiety. Not overly strong; works in the background. Allows me to hold a job without feeling overburdened. Allows me to be in public places without feeling overwhelmed. Very pleased with Diazepam. Has no side effects, even from the onset of starting it. Definitely recommend if your doctor will prescribe.",HereditaryBane

10,Diazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 5, 2021",0,I started to suffer with acute anxiety about six months ago it was so bad I had never experienced anything like it the fear and terror I felt constantly was unbearable I couldn’t sleep or hardly eat every time I swallowed food I felt sick.My doctor prescribed sertraline and also gave me twenty 5 mg diazepam The sertraline just made my anxiety worse which they did explain it would do for the first couple of weeks however I stuck on it for three months I had constant diarrhoea for the whole time and eventually they sent me for a colonoscopy luckily came back all clear apart from they had to remove a couple of polyps. I came off the sertraline and the diarrhoea stopped within a week. I asked my doctor if they could prescribe 5 mg diazepam because they were the only thing that took the anxiety away made me feel calm. They refused to give me any more diazepam and said I would become addicted to them.,Mr D

Took 2mg and the attack got worse. At 8am I finally calmed a little, but was so drowsy and foggy headed I couldn’t do anything but lay in bed.

12,Diazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 20, 2021",2,"I was prescribed this 3 years ago after struggling my whole life with debilitating anxiety, depression, insomnia and intrusive thoughts. I'd regularly have to go to hospital for IBS type symptoms due to the anxiety manifesting itself as a physical illness. I was unable to meet friends or socialise without feeling terrified. I was unable to hold down a job.Finally a doctor prescribed me this. Within a month of taking up to 15mg a day spread over 3 doses my life improved drastically. I did not take it every day and rarely took the full 15mg. Usually just taking 5mg before work. I was finally able to function and received praise from employers who offered me work contracts and higher pay. In 3 years I never abused the drug or developed a tolerance. I was also able to have a functioning social life for the first time ever.2 months ago I had to change GP. They have now ruined my life by suddenly taking me off my medication. Nobody will listen.

13,Diazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 16, 2021",4,"Valium (diazepam):For my panic disorder I used to take short-acting benzos i.e, Ativan which, of course, works; however, dependence and subsequent painful withdrawal followed hours after discontinuation. I am able to take Valium which is a long-acting benzo that seems (for me) a slower onset of action and a much longer duration of action. I notice that I'm able to start/stop the medication without experiencing withdrawal symptoms like I had with Ativan. Sometimes, can go weeks even months without a need to take. I use 2 MG, works great, have never needed more, in fact, sometimes I break the pill in half and only take 1 MG. The drug certainly can be abused, but I do feel it gets a bad rap. As always, this medication isn't for everyone and shouldn't be used by everyone.",Robimat1
14,Diazepam,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 11, 2021",2,If you are someone with anxiety and have a certain amount of self control that allows you to keep doses low and avoid abuse then this is the drug for you. I have a set amount for the month and choose my moments wisely to take it. I leave days between doses to keep tolerance levels good . My anxiety will last my remaining days. This drug gives me much needed relief. It’s not a cure though and I shall not take it every day. If you are prone to erratic behaviour then keep away from this drug. It will come and bite you back.,Silkco
15,Diazepam,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 8, 2021",5,"I have spent too long on benzodiazepines in general. 6 Years on 3 or 4 mg of Clonazepam.I began a taper and switched to Diazepam at 60mg a day instead of the 3mg of Clonazepam. TID.I notice I am no longer depressed. I believe the Clonazepam made me depressed. I no longer feel a strange deep sadness.The major effects from Diazepam don't last as long. 4 hours for me instead of Clonazepam 6 hours for me. But overall I am sleeping better. I have no problem waiting for or forgetting my next dose.Where as Clonazepam I needed to keep a timer, and take it exactly every 8 hours or else I would start to go into minor withdrawals. The Clonazepam would rapidly drop off. With Diazepam the effects come faster, last longer in a less pronounced and more wavering down. So I can wait until I need my next dose. And not struggle with minor withdrawals for 2 or 3 hours because I forgot my meds.I take a high dose because of tolerance. Treats my PTSD symptoms better than Clonazepam.",Transition

It calmed my anxiety down, yeah, but I started feeling insanely sleepy, detached from reality, angry, and not like myself. This was my very first time taking it, won’t take it ever again. Ativan is the BEST benzodiazepine out there, hands down never disappoints me. I was acting all weird, paranoid, saying weird things, and MORE anxious.

I don't smoke, because tobacco is also a stimulant, that would further make my sleep disorder worse.

To cut it short, I go to Dr's and tell them I'm in recovery and I've been on Valium for YEARS! I realize, if I stop I will go through nightmares,  so I am not stopping., I hope they don't take it off the market, as they do with other drugs. When I smoked cigarettes, I was up to 60 mg to sleep!

20,Diazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 17, 2021",1,"Valium (diazepam):I originally had this prescribed as I was coming off antidepressants. I only took it on days my mood swings were severely debilitating. I kept having it prescribed for moments I felt I was suffering with irritability or anxiety. It was helpful, and certainly beneficial for major events where I woke up with panic attacks after 3 hours broken sleep. It has been a saviour but gradually became a substance I easily turned to when things got hectic to the point I was using my inner resources and ability to sit with pain less efficiently.I eventually developed a tolerance and binged periodically. I changed my perspective and labelled the situation for what it was and decided to go sober. I'm managing fine and had no physical withdrawals, but the psychological addiction of valium is real. And doctors aren't going to monitor properly, I just hope others who have less experience with addiction can see whats going on if they experience this and trust their own judgement.",Grm

I love it, it’s changed my life (I’m 73) and made my extremely high blood pressure (in addition with blood pressure pills) go down to normal. I feel calm and would like to stay on it. I never feel like I need more.  I also take Omeprazole acid reflux medication. 4 1/2 months I started having bad hunger pains, would eat a big meal but the pain stayed. Each spring and fall I’ve always had an acid reflux flare up for a few weeks then it goes back to normal. It’s now fall and here we go again, but this time it seems worse. I’ve read that taking Omeprazole and Diazepam can be a moderate problem with breathing problems (which I don’t have) and it says nothing about affecting Gerd.

I don't like to take any medications and really thought about this, trying to just overcome the need and praying for help. Well, sometimes you need some help, so why resist feeling so bad when this is out there to help you feel better. I suggest to speak to your doctor and go from there.

29,Diazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 9, 2021",2,I was on 2 mg Xanax three times a day then switched Klonopin 2 mg three times a day. And also on Valium 10 mg four times a day at one point I've tried all three and Valium is by far the best. If you're looking to get high maybe Xanax bars but if you just start taking it for anxiety and other issues such as neck spasms muscle spasms along with anxiety issues I find it to work the best. Klonopin is just messed up can't remember what day of the week it is on Klonopin. Xanax is too short acting and too addictive. So I like Valium it's longer acting than all of them and it works really good and I'm taking 5 mg four times a day now. I've been taking the medicine since 1997 between Xanax Klonopin and Valium I rotated throughout the years so I know what I'm talking about at least for me Valium is the best,Buster
30,Diazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 3, 2021",0,So I suffer from anxiety and have taken a small few valiums over the last 2 years. Recently I've received my pfizer covid vaccines and my anxiety shot up to an extremely high level. Ended up taking 2 valiums of 5mg over the first 4 days of 1st dose and took 4 valium of 5 mg again over the space of a week after  2nd dose. This drug is brilliant and helped massively in keeping me calm while going through a few days of side effects from vaccine. I probably won't have to touch the tablets again for another few months until anxiety peaks again but would have been lost without them.

I never required more than 5 mg (half a pill) because it already has a strong effect on me. It instantly relaxes me and takes away the anxiety.

The taste is bitter-sweet, but entirely edible, very tolerable because it's so tiny. It certainly has addictive potential precisely because it is so useful. It sends me straight to sleep as well, meaning that even if I'm not that tired, it will make me very sleepy, and if I am tired it will knock me out completely, letting me sleep deeply for at least 7 hours before waking up.

Recently been found to be closest to body's natural neurotransmitters compared to other benzos. You can get addicted to any drug. I've tried many antidepressants. Bad side effects.  Terrible side effects.  Look at risperdal. If I have a headache I take some tylenol or motrin and 9 time out of 10 my headache goes away. I can take an drug that they tell me might take 2 weeks or longer to start working. Maybe. If I'm having a panic attack I can't wait 2 weeks. I need something that works quickly. And if I have a seizure I don't wanna wait weeks for that either. I consider this drug like my insulin. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder among other  things and I have taken seizures before. Valium works best for me. 5mg in the morning and I am productive and fine for 8 to 10 hours.  This medication has been a lifesaver for me for a long time. I do not believe it deserves the bad reputation it has for being SO addictive.,Sklawz

You will need to slow taper off of it if you have been taking this long-term, and this can take months or years. Check out Benzo Buddies for the horror stories.

I had said it was depression. I never really felt anxious but took it thinking he must know what he’s doing. Well that was the beginning of the worse experience I’ve ever had. I took it as directed & within a week I started having horrible anxiety! Never did I ever have this feeling before. It was sheer panic & extreme agitation. It was especially bad between doses but even when taken it did little to stop it. I literally was in hell. How could Valium cause me severe  anxiety?? Well I learned it was a paradoxical reaction. My Dr brushed it off & I ended up in patient at a hospital for 2 weeks! They gave me muscle relaxers & neurontin  to try to calm me down. Then they gave me seroquel which made me a virtual zombie. These meds starting with the careless actions of a  so called Dr  destroyed my life for months & put me & my husband through hell.,Diane

After arguing back and forth, I agreed to take it on a limited basis. Now I use 2 mg, 4 times a day as needed, but only before lying down and never when I will be driving or need to otherwise be alert.
