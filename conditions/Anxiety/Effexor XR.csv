0,Effexor XR,Anxiety,9.0,,"February 23, 2022",3,The first couple days I felt weird. The very first dose made my hands and feet sweat for less than 10 mins. I was a little worried because how I felt in the beginning. I've tried various anxiety and depression meds in the past. My doctor said this is stronger. I have always been a little anxious and have suffered a few panic attacks in my lifetime. (I'm 41 yrs) I'm now on my 4th week and feel amazing. I'm more active and enjoy things again. I used to dread leaving my house even just to run an errand. Now I am out and about. I didn't realize how much I really needed this medication. I take it in the morning with breakfast 150 mg. I even sleep better at night. I used to constantly wake up in the middle of the night.,Marie
1,Effexor XR,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 15, 2022",0,"My Doctor out me on Cipralex and for anxiety, depression and panic attacks and for  months it did nothing but kept hearing it take 6 to 8 weeks. Well those weeks passed and nothing changed until my doctor told me to try Effexor within a week I noticed myself feeling better. Now the only problem I had is in the 1percentile super lucky me, my periods stopped. We are trying to have a baby and if we were done that stage in our lives I'd say I'm all for not having a period but we aren't. So after months of feeling better I slowly weened myself off of it. I was on a low dose so it wasn't that hard but 2 weeks later I got my period back.",Anonymous
2,Effexor XR,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 5, 2022",2,After reading so many mixed reviews I want to share my experience because if I would have listened to the reviews on here I would’ve stopped taking the medication. I was put on this medication for anxiety and panic attacks and mild depression the side effects I had were awful. I felt anxious my panic attacks were completely heightened and didn’t start getting used to the medication for the full six weeks. They say that it takes about 4 to 6 weeks for your body to get used to the medication because if you think about it it’s basically reprogramming your brain. I experienced feelings of almost being on speed like my body couldn’t calm down my skin felt weird. I was lucky enough to have an aunt that also took it and she experienced the same things but said that all the side effects are worth it and one day you just wake up and feel normal which is exactly what happened to me .,Cindythompson1
3,Effexor XR,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2021",2,"I guess I'm one of the unlucky ones and had what I would consider a pretty bad reaction to this medication. I only took two doses, but I didn't want to know how much worse it would get. First day was okay, no nausea but I felt moments of depersonalization. The second day I felt more of the depersonalization and at night I woke up with racing thoughts and hot flashes - my entire body felt like it was tingly and hot and my heart was racing and I was sweating profusely. This episode lasted for a good 10-15 minutes. Once I calmed down I got chills and tried going back to sleep. I was woken up 2 more times with the same feeling..I decided to discontinue this med because if it's going to make my anxiety worse, even just for the first few weeks it isn't worth it to me.",Cinthe6ix
4,Effexor XR,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 24, 2021",1,"i have now been on effexor XR since the beginning of summer. At first  2 months it seemed to calm my anxiety and I didn't panic as much but that quickly subsided as quick as it started, so I went up a dose (from 37.5-75 to 112.5mg) and it had not changed anything. About 5 or months in I started noticing spikes in my panic attacks, anxiety, and depression, the depression being the worst. I also got prescribed adderall which I take ""as needed' also helps with everything. The effexor now I can't tell if it does anythin, as my anxiety and depression came back full force.  Like it didn't do anything to begin with now or at least barely. Also I do see many things about withdraws. Yeah its said you get them but at least for me it is super bearable like not smoking for a day. That being said it to me seems as useless sugar. I'm really hoping to soon find something that actually does something, these kind of drugs are sugar pills to me or increases depression and anxiety and irrational thoughts.",anon
5,Effexor XR,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 11, 2021",3,"This medicine is the only one that I can sleep on and don't have sexual side effects on.  I've tried numerous medications but this one has really helped my aniexty/mood.  I'm on 75 mgs for about 3 months and already can tell a difference.  No panic attacks, can concentrate on daily tasks without worry.  I know some people had side effects but the only side effect I had was some tiredness.  I love this medicine and would recommend it to anyone with anxiety/worry.",Shawnee
6,Effexor XR,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 9, 2021",1,"I've been on Klonopin for 27 years and I tried all sorts of antidepressants along with it. About two years ago I started Adderall and soon discovered that it worked like any other antidepressant for me. It totally wiped away my social anxieties; however, in May my doctor also thought it was a good idea to get off of Klonopin which wasn't great news for me. The Adderall alone wasn't enough and he put me on BuSpar but ended up in the hospital. The staff refused to listen to me because they don't believe in benzos and controlled substances. I was put on Effexor and realized it wasn't for me, but the doctors kept pumping me full of beta-blockers to reduce my anxiety and had me on Klonopin for several days then released me without a script for Klonopin. Now I'm struggling to find myself in midst of all the chaos. I was stuck with Effexor and beta-blockers and told to follow up with my psychiatrist. I wish everyone here doesn't go through the same ordeal as me. Benzos are not worth it.",john333
7,Effexor XR,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 2, 2021",3,"Honestly I was prescribed this after being prescribed sertraline (it made my anxiety so much worse) and it has helped quite a bit.

After 4 years I did ask my doctor to increase my dosage to 300mg due to some extremely stressful  situations I was going thru and sure enough, it gave me the relief I needed.  I have had no side affects from this medication.  My only advise it to not miss a dose as  withdraw starts immediately and it is not pleasant.

10,Effexor XR,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 3, 2021",4,"Took effexor XR for anxiety and depression. This was not the drug for me even though trying for months. My anxiety and depression worsened and bought in suicidal thoughts. I couldn’t eat or sleep without taking something to help, I would get brain zaps. It 100% made me so much worst and turned me into a different person.If going on this, make sure you keep a diary of how you feel each day, use family for support to help if you can. If it doesn’t feel right speak to your doctor. I would hate for anyone to suffer as much as I did because the doctor kept saying it’s meant to get worst before it gets better. Seek second opinions if it doesn’t feel right. I will never touch that again.",Sydney

12,Effexor XR,Anxiety,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 12, 2021",2,"Okay so I was only on the lowest dose of 37.5 but it worked for my anxiety and OCD. Did it completely change my life? No, but that was probably just due to the dose and I could’ve gone higher but didn’t want to mess with my mind. What got me to finally STOP taking this was the side effects when you miss a dose. Good god I don’t want to go through that ever again. I’m a nanny, so often I would get home and fall asleep and forget to take my med. Usually I’d just take it in the a.m., but if I had a particularly rushed morning and forgot, by noon I would be suffering the consequences. Migraines, dizziness, nausea, that hazy feeling when you’re extra sensitive to the light and you feel like there’s a fog around you. All of that until I was able to get home and take another pill. It shouldn’t be like that. Do I need to maybe be better about taking it on time? Yes absolutely. But I shouldn’t feel like a zombie 12 hours after missing it. Anyway I ran out of them and decided it was time to stop.",I don't even know

14,Effexor XR,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 28, 2021",3,"I could not get past the first dose of 37.5 mg. It made me extremely nauseous, loss of appetite, tired but could not sleep, very irritable, weak, diarrhea and made my anxiety worse. It was the extended release and could literally feel when it was releasing into my body. This went on for two days. I could not get out of bed. Once the nightmare was over, I was so weak like I’d had the flu and needed to rebuild my strength. I’ve taken Lexapro in the past and while that just made me feel blah, it was 100x better than this. I know every drug effects people differently but believe you can tell fairly quickly if a drug is right for you or not. I’ve now been prescribed Paroxetine. I’m so nervous to try it as I’m afraid it will make me feel awful too but will give it a whirl once I feel I’ve fully recovered from Effexor.",Kimmer

16,Effexor XR,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 13, 2021",8,This medication was working at first. But then it stopped working made my anxiety worse had weird episodes where I would dissociate and depersonalize. I decided to do something really stupid and quickly weaned myself off. I've been on so many antidepressants before. DO NOT DO WHAT I DID without letting your psychologist know. The withdrawals were so bad. My mood would crash I felt like I was falling and I was the most anxious and depressed I would be in my entire life. My panic attacks were so bad kolonopin did nothing for them. I weaned off of 112.5 mg. I didn't like this drug... to say the least,Luna

I tried to start taking it again yesterday morning, felt fine all day until about 5pm. I started feeling super dizzy and spaced out. Almost like I had been drugged. Felt out of reality somehow and detached. I will never take this medication again. The way I felt yesterday was so horrible it's not worth it for me to take.",Missanxiety

19,Effexor XR,Anxiety,9.0,,"March 22, 2021",95,"Since my middle east deployment I've dealt with panic attacks. It got to the point I was severely agoraphobia, not even able to leave my home to drive to the gas station a mile away. VA SSRIs never worked. After being drug to the local ER due to severe brain fogginess, ER physician suggested norepinephrine might be the issue, not the serotonin. Dr also took it and said to give Effexor XR a go. 3 weeks later I believe he may be right. I no longer am focusing on every little beat my heart makes. I can drive again. I can go places. I'm not perfect yet but major improvements have happened. Fogginess is still there a tad bit but not nearly as horrible as it was 3 weeks ago. It's not even fully in my system yet. If you have taken all the SSRIs there are with no results, try this. It works. I've heard withdrawals are real bad but I'm not worried about that right now. It just feels good to feel a bit more normal again. Praise God.P.S. I'm still able to ""perform"" with the wife. Another huge relief.",Panic guy
20,Effexor XR,Anxiety,9.0,,"March 2, 2021",110,"I’ve had depression anxiety my whole life and I’m diagnosed major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I tried all the other antidepressants didn’t really know if they worked or not, new Dr. slowly tapered me up on Effexor. That was about a year ago... The side effects weren’t terrible some nausea and insomnia for like a week and then after that the side effects were gone. I feel so much better honestly and I’m not just saying that because the Lexapro and Cymbalta I never knew if they were working or not. This helps with my anxiety a lot and rumination and also this is the first winter I’ve enjoyed in at least a decade. Also I have an eight-year-old four-year-old and three-month-old all girls and virtual schooling is still on, so it definitely helps me be more patient And takes the edge off so I don’t yell and scream in a fit of exasperation. I was also afraid of getting postpartum but I honestly haven’t felt any of that thank the Lord.",Cleveland
21,Effexor XR,Anxiety,3.0,,"March 1, 2021",5,"I had some severe anxiety after everything that went on with the COVID and my partner being in constant suicidal depression. My GP offered the medicine as a way to get through the tough time, and it kinda did, but not without some major downsides. It did lessen the anxiety, but it also got rid of any kind of drive I ever had (sex, motivation, creativity), so my depression got much worse in the meanwhile. It felt like nothing mattered anymore. I didn't care. I gained 8-10 lbs in the 2 months I was on it (I was losing slowly beforehand) and I got NOTHING done aside from the bare minimum while I was on it. My sleep was also heavily disrupted/unrestful, moreso than usual.I was on the lowest dose for such a short amount of time, yet the withdrawals were pretty bad (zaps, dizziness, nausea) and lasted several days.

25,Effexor XR,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 29, 2021",8,"I am a college student with severe GAD and MDD, as well as have derealization disorder. Before switching to Effexor, I was on 75 mg of Zoloft for almost 5 years and it had done WONDERS for my anxiety. Eventually, I hit a plateau point and Zoloft no longer worked. I started taking Effexor soon after and had no problems in transitioning. I missed a dose about a month in and had horrible withdrawal symptoms, but still nothing comparable to the level of anxiety I’m used to. I felt super dizzy and just wanted to sleep. Missing one dose did set me back—it’s about two months later and I’m getting back to the place I was before I missed. But other than that, I’d say that it has certainly helped me learn how to better cope with my anxiety.",pinm

I had so much anxiety after work that I would like to have an alcoholic drink and sometimes a cigarette to calm my nerves. The problem with this is because alcohol makes anxiety worse if you drink more than two drinks. So it was an endless cycle. I was also getting to the point where I couldn’t get off the couch and had no motivation to do anything, Taking a shower was hard for me. I was sleeping a lot!!!  Start out on theEffexor XR 37.5mg dose for about a week or two before moving up to 75 mg. At first it made me feel really weird, my mind would race and I was having a hard time sleeping. I stuck it out! I am now taking 75 mg and I’m so much better! I get up at 6:00 am when I used to sleep until 9:00. I go to the gym 3 days a week, I get dressed up and now I have a part time job.

I have noticed some emotional bluntness but its welcome over how I felt before.

Insomia, night sweats, horrific dreams and visions. I couldn't think or concentrate, I couldn't work or drive, my head was spinning, I couldn't talk properly. The headache was so bad it landed me in hospital. I was so tired and couldn't stop yawning. I actually thought I was going insane on this drug. Loss of appetite followed by drastic weight loss, diarrhoea. I persisted another week than thats when the electric shocks started through my body. They were horrendous and left me thinking there was something wrong with me neurologically. Against doctors advice, I went cold turkey off of this drug. The withdrawal was horrific but I was determined to get this stuff out of my body. Even 7 months off the drug, I still get some of the shocks and feel this drug has permanently damaged me.

The best advice I can offer is go into with a mindset that this is going to help you. In the scariest time of my life when I had panic disorder, was having trouble eating and sleeping Effexor saved me. I took Lexapro terrified to take it and had horrible reactions. This drug makes me feel like myself minus   panicking. I didn't feel like it kicked in until about 3 months. The only thing is it does make you feel a like more ""flat"" but I was a little over emotional so it helped with this. I've been on this for almost a year and would recommend trying it.",ks

It depends on what form of anxiety u have. Prozac helped with not panicking in stressful situations but did not help with my fear thoughts. With norepinephrine things drastically changed.

I had tried a couple of ADs for anxiety and depression with poor results. 150 mg Effexor and 300 mg Seroquel Prolong finally did the trick for me.

If I didn’t take it exactly at the same time every day I would get dizziness and headaches and often had headaches even if I properly took it. I had constipation so I had to take meds for that.

So after 8 years I felt it wasn’t working as well as before for the anxiety and I was fed up of the side effects so I decided to change meds.

I know it takes longer to see the real effects of the drug, but I’m already less anxious and the weight is just falling off. No bad side effects except a little constipation and a slight head ache the first week.",Rose

She was put on Lexapro after my great hesitation as she was so young. It helped a little. When 7th grade hit her body was 2 seconds from fight or flight. Frequent panic attacks were long and exhausting. Long story short she had genetic testing done and Effexor was on her list of Med's that should work.

Zoloft would be my second choice, except I needed to nap everyday and I was always hungry. Cymbalta was very difficult to get off of and I was also very tired. Negative effects of effexor include  insomnia - i have urges where i HAVE to get up- but usually melatonin and reading, and NO electronics before bed help that (or xanax as needed.) I also sweat a lot more on it. But having more energy and more libido make it worth it. I have to take a beta blocker because I speak infront of people.",Social phobia

Week three, the insomnia kicked in and strange urges to HAVE to get up and move around.  Week four,  Serious shortness of breath on exertion, ringing ears, lip numbness and malaise.  Turns out I was allergic to it!  Doc tool me off it, immediately, then the withdraw began.  OH my G*#.  The worst experience of my life.
