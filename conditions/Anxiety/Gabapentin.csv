2,Gabapentin,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2022",2,"This medicine is a miracle drug for my anxiety. The best part of this drug is that it works *just right*. Not too much that you get hooked and not too little that it's a dud. For me, I take citalopram (Celexa) for my anxiety but when I have a panic attack or super bad anxiety gabapentin calms me down in about 30 minutes. No adverse side effects. I used to take an Ativan or Zanax for an anxiety attack and those work *too well* where I would have cravings for the euphoric state. Thank you, gabapentin.",anxiouspug003

4,Gabapentin,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 9, 2022",1,"My experience with gabepentin has been pretty good, I am a drug addict that has been clean for  4 years now, and honestly it has given me my life back. My anxiety since I got off IV meth was so bad I couldn't even leave my house, it was horrible and it made me feel worthless. My MHMR Dr decided to try me on it and it has helped me tremendously. I will say this tho, if I run out before I can see my Dr to get a refill, it's horrible! My anxiety is through the roof. I try not to run out, but it's also really hard bc I am an addict and I have a tendency to overtake everything, even over the counter pm pills but I am working on that.  I know this drug isn't for everyone, but for me it's been great..",Xoxo
5,Gabapentin,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 24, 2021",1,Trash. Might work for a month or so then does nothing even with increased dose. It makes anxiety worse and gives you a woozy effect OR literally does nothing. Never know which option it will be but their both trash options lol. This shouldn't even be an option to be prescribed to people tbh,Hayiles

They diagnosed me with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder). I have known forever that I had suffered from anxiety but never took any medication until 2019. The doctor prescribed me Gabapentin, but I was reluctant to take it because of my fear of getting addicted to this medication, and brain damage after taking it for a long time, but after reading so many of the comments in this section, I've decided it to give it a try once more time. I took 300 mg today and felt the relief right away, so I'm glad that this medication exists and that I'm able to take it.",Hanna

My first dose 100 mg was so - so, with a bit of anxiety but I was able to fight though it. My second dose (100mg) brought a bit more anxiety but I thought it’s not from the drug. It must be me. My third dose (100mg) brought on so much anxiety that I  could not shaking violently. It’s almost like I’m about to have a seizure! I had to call 9-1-1, and took a Clonazapam while waiting for the medics to arrive. I’m happy for those who found comfort in this drug, but it’s not for me.

10,Gabapentin,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 22, 2021",4,"I've been on Paxil and Wellbutrin for anxiety/depression for 21 years.  In general I've responded well to these SSRIs but once in a while when my emotional workload reaches a high level they are not enough.  Strictly as an infrequent intervention Xanax manages to slow things down and restore my functionality,  but it also makes me sleepy and close colleagues have told me they can tell I'm on a benzo.  This year I tried gabapentin instead and found it to be an effective stabilizer without any perceptible side effects.  I've been on gabapentin now for 4 months and it has allowed me to taper the paxil to 10mg daily.  This reduction has restored a degree of sexual functioning.  So far it's all good hear although it is still early in my experience.",Nickel56

17,Gabapentin,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 25, 2021",8,"I was prescribed gabapentin about fifteen years ago for restless leg syndrome.  I took 300 mg every night before relaxing for the night, and the restless leg syndrome became a non-issue.  It worked great.  For my ongoing mild depression and anxiety, I had tried a number of things (mostly SNRI), none of which worked for me. Then this past year, I started experiencing some pretty severe anxiety and panic, on a daily basis, and noticed that interestingly, it would resolve each night about an hour after my usual dose of gabapentin.  I would feel relaxed and my mind at relative ease.  I told my doctor this, and learned that yes, it can help with anxiety.  She increased my dose to ""as needed"" up to three times a day.  Currently I am managing my symptoms at 300 mg twice a day, and it has been like ""thank God!"".",grannygoose
18,Gabapentin,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 25, 2021",8,"I experienced a tragedy three years ago when my husband committed suicide in our home. This caused depression, fear, anxiety, and panic attacks. It is more severe now that the two estates are closing and there is not the administrative duties to keep me busy after work. It has been three years of stress and stress induced health issues. I have taken Xanax on occasion when I feel severe anxiety or have a panic attack. My doctor prescribed Gabapentin for my sciatica pain. Right away I noticed a reduction in my anxiety and depression. At first it did make me fuzzy-thinking and slightly dizzy, but that stopped within a week or two. I take 300 mg twice per day - morning and night about 12 hours apart. It helps me to feel more positive and be more productive. I was getting to the point recently where I cried easily and felt self-pity.

Benzos, barbiturates, Buspar, SSRI’s…for 10 years of my life I took benzos daily, switching between benzos every couple of weeks. I finally got off of them and shortly thereafter I was put on Gabapentin. I’m on 600mg 4x a day, and my anxiety is sooo well managed that’s it’s an insane relief. I have tried Gabapentin multiple times in the past with no luck but it works incredibly now. It helps keep me calm, happy, and also helps with my alcohol cravings. I am on other medications but I truly feel like Gabapentin has played a vital roll in my mental health. I’ve tried to lower the dosage and it just ends up with me having more anxiety! The combination I’m on right now works miracles, I’m so thankful.",birdy

23,Gabapentin,Anxiety,10.0,,"June 15, 2021",13,"This is a miracle drug for me. It is not a cure, because the symptoms come back if I don't take it. I experience a 100% reduction in GAD at my current dose taken 3 times a day. Side effects non-existant.At > 1200mg single dose, there is a borderline hypomania experience that told us  that was too high for me. This effect is reproducible as well. Big Pharma is probably scared of this generic drug. My suspicion is it will work better on people with neurological comorbidities, because these people are more likely to have the neurological dysfunction it helps to manage. I will go even further and hypothesize this is related to damaged nerves interfering with processes through calcium gated channels, and its activity related to GABA probably supports this. I have done some research on CGC and neurogenesis that I think is related to thisThis desperately needs clinical research and basic research.",VA Jp

Last year it became too much to bare since I had started a new career and was in grad school, moved to a new city and also trying to survive a pandemic.  My doc put my on lexapro which seemed pretty awful to some degree but it wasn’t quite right.  I went to a psychiatrist to see if there might be something more appropriate and she added gabapentin to my lexapro and it was almost instantly so much better.

27,Gabapentin,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 17, 2021",10,"I first began gabapentin 800 mg three times a day when I was 16 years old. I had horrible anxiety that was constant and caused me to have many issues in school. I would leave school due to panic attacks, and I began to feel suicidal because of how severe my anxiety was. When I began gabapentin my anxiety was completely gone immediately. As a teenager this was god sent and I quickly raised the dose to see if I could feel even more amazing. It not only got rid of my anxiety but also made me feel kinda floaty and buzzing, like a mild high. Anyways, I took this medicine until I was 26 years old. It took me almost 2 years of weaning off it with horrible anxiety and some psychotic tendencies emerging as I cut down. Here I am at the age of 29, and I can say I am still recovering and have very little memory of ten years of my life. Today I struggle with my cognition and short term memory.

28,Gabapentin,Anxiety,10.0,,"April 11, 2021",18,"About 5 months ago I had a major panic attack.  Over the last 5 months I realized I have GAD and depression pretty bad.  I have always had this but it took therapy for me to realize what it was.  I had abused alcohol in the past as a means to cope (6 years sober now).  I tried several medications (Zoloft, Buspirone, Hydroxyzine, Trazodone, and Ativan).  Ativan was a very bad experience.  I had to wean myself off it over a very long period of time and while doing so it gave me panic attacks.  Finally, my psychiatrist asked me to try Gabapentin.  It was almost immediate that it worked for me.  It's a calming effect similar to marijuana but much milder.  It's a very safe drug and not habit forming (physiological at least, I can see it being psychologically addictive).  I've been on it 1 month and this month has been amazing.  Almost seems too good to be true so I'm still a bit skeptical about longer term usage, so we'll see.",Ricky

I thought it might be helpful to readers to see how the medicine continues to work for me.  Week 2 : 5 days ago I increased to 300mg 2x day.  At first I felt really anxious after taking it.  I also had a foggy, drunk feeling & blurred vision.  After a couple days most side effects went away.  I still will get very anxious after taking it, sometimes.  This drug is weird.  I feel like there is no consistency, or perhaps my dose is wrong?  For the first time in my life I feel DRUGGED.  There are moments I feel better but don't feel myself?  One night I split my night dose into two 150mg doses.  That was my best night.  I think I will try that again tonight. Good luck to all of you who have Anxiety and Depression.

I am assuming she is going to increase the dosage.   I was optimistic when it worked immediately, but now a little disappointed I have to increase it already.

55,Gabapentin,Anxiety,8.0,,"December 13, 2019",179,"I've struggled with moderate to severe generalized anxiety for all of my life - mostly related to social and performance situations. I've tried many different drugs and have never been sure that they worked. Then I was prescribed Neurontin, and I can 100% feel the difference. My anxiety has decreased significantly on this drug. It sedates me nicely to the point that I'm still completely alert and myself, but I'm so much more easygoing and relaxed. My physical symptoms related to anxiety are still there but I feel less anxious about them, if that makes sense. It just makes the world much more bearable.There are some negative side effects - such as low sex drive, dizziness (which went away after taking for a few weeks), and sometimes I get extra teary. But it's not much of a price to pay if it helps with the main demon of anxiety!  Drugs affect everyone differently, but if you think your life is negatively affected by anxiety, it's definitely worth trying.",kris

98,Gabapentin,Anxiety,9.0,,"December 12, 2018",73,"My doctor suggested I get off Klonopin and he put me on Gabapentin. It has helped tremendously with anxiety before bedtime. The best way I can describe it is I suddenly feel calm and dreamy and like I can turn my mind off and finally stop over thinking. Much in the way a benzodiazepine would make me feel, but without feeling too dizzy or like I'm losing my memory. Another thing it has helped with is to slow down my drinking. I use to drink before bedtime to help me fall asleep (which has its side effects, but I felt it was better than tossing and turning all night)... The Gabapentin actually turns off that craving somehow and I don't desire any sort of drink before bed. I also somehow quit smoking. The one thing I can tell you Gabapentin does NOT work with are things like panic attacks. Taking a Gabapentin during a panic attack will probably do nothing, in comparison to a benzodiazepine. It will reduce anxiety in a more general sense though.",Mitch

SSRI's had little effect. I finished my degree and actually got a job.  For anxiety you need a higher dose , I started with 100mg x 3 and worked up to 1800mg a day, the sweet spot. Few things I will warn others , the withdraw is pretty bad . I ran out 3 days before refill and begged the pharamacist to refill it 2 days early. As well , sometimes its difficult to get a good erection. My  psychiatrist gave me wellbrutin to counter that effect. Genertic brand warning - auro gabapentin is a terrible , low effectiveness.

100,Gabapentin,Anxiety,7.0,,"November 16, 2018",29,"I have taken many SSRIs, tricyclics, etc. that didn’t help depression or anxiety.  Cognitive behavioral helped and  klonopin worked moderately, and that’s all that worked.  I started Gabapentin at 100 mg 3 x a day.  I immediately noticed improvement and it also helped me feel more like not staying up late like I always do.  Klonopin is very helpful if you can’t find relief in SSRIs & you don’t have addictions, but for the first time I’m hopeful that this Gabapentin might work. If it works even better at a higher dose I’ll give it 10 stars. The only other thing that helped me a lot was l-methyl-folate.  I have the MTHFR gene mutation and the l-metal folate worked, but I had a side affect every time I took it.  I found a doctor that might be able to get rid of the side effect.  So after 40 years I now have 2 drugs other than klonopin that give me some hope.   SSRIs give me bad side effects but no positive results.",revems

Gabapentin relieves the pain for me and helps me to stay in the present. The only side effect for me is extreme paranoia if I take more than 100mgs a day. I'm tiny and very sensitive to medication so low doses are more effective. I also take Lamictal daily which helps to counter any paranoia.

I would have given it 10 stars if it didn't have such a quick tolerance factor. After about 3 consecutive days of taking it, it begins. The symptoms of Anxiety began returning slowly each day until you increase dosage. And that increase is way to frequent. The best way to deal with this down side isn't by increasing dosage every time, as that would take no time to reach unsafe dosages, but to not use it daily. If your going to use it for Anxiety purposes only, then only take it on the days your really struggling. Done this way, then it's a miracle drug for controlling Anxiety.

I usually worry, have circular negative thought patterns, and feel awkward and lost in my head most of the day.

I'm sure my anti depression meds and my birth control are definitely helping but I know that without Gabapentin my anxiety would be a wreck still. Super glad my psychiatrist placed me on it!,Summmmssss
211,Gabapentin,Anxiety,10.0,,"March 31, 2017",184,"Gabapentin has really helped me with anxiety. I used to always be thinking of what I had to do while I was busy with something else.  For example, I would worry about what I had to do after work while I was at work.  I would play future scenarios over and over before they even occurred. I would play past experiences over and over.  Some call this rumination.  Much of this has either dropped down to a manageable level or just disappeared with gabapentin. I have never been one much into pharmaceuticals but this one works for me.  I can see that some people love how it works for them, some people despise of it, and others say it doesn't do a thing for them. We are all different and what works for one doesn't work for another, just like diet.I'm much happier going out and doing ordinary things like shopping, going to the bank, and other ordinary routine tasks.  I easily get bored with ordinary tasks and just want to get them done.  I just wanted to get things over with so that I could take on the next task. Now, I can be more with what I am doing without having to rush through it to get to the next goal. I take my time and stop to talk with people.  It's ok if I'm late for the next task so long as it's not an appointment where others are involved.  The main thing for me is to enjoy people when I go out to a store, or the bank, or wherever!  The gabapentin helps a part of my brain slow down so that I can ""see"" the people in my day.  It really feels good to go to the gym and not feel tied to a specific exercise routine anymore. I like going in with a goal in mind, but allow for what the body is telling me.  Instead of just checking in at the desk, I'm more likely to spend time saying hello and having patience. So what if it means that I will get home 5 minutes later and eat dinner 5 minutes later, and then get 5 minutes less sleep. Big deal!  I see from writing this that gabapentin helps me to be less obsessiveWith gabapentin, it is much easier for me to accept doing a job I am tired of. I've been at the same job for a long job and was getting antsy to move on. There isn't anything bad about the job, but doing anything ""forever"" gets kind of old. Now, I know that soon I will be making a change, but can be""more"" patient until the change happens. If I were completely patient, then the change would never happen. There is still fire to make the change happen. I feel less anxiety about change and welcome it more now. There are times in life when change is good.  I don't feel as dead in my tracks with fearing change. It's  o.k. if I don't figure out ""everything"" today because there is always tomorrow! Yes, I am very satisfied with how gabapentin works.  I give it a 10 out of 10.",Matthew6969

My whole body aches, and I feel sick and have no appetite. I took my last dose a week ago and the withdrawals are still very noticeable.
