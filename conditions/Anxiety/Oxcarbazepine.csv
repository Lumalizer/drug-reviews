0,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 9, 2022",2,"So I was prescribed this medication for my anxiety flare ups and my horrible mood swings. For reference I am only on 150mg which is the lowest mg you can get and I have to split the tablet in half which makes that 75 mg. I have only been on it roughly a week and the side affects outweigh the positive affects. I’m so exhausted, I have diarrhea after everything I eat, I feel sick to my stomach, and I feel SO disconnected from reality. Like my body feels here but my mind is somewhere else. And it’s so overwhelming that it’s an uncomfortable feelings. I also kinda feel like a zombie as well, like I'm just here. I don’t really do anything or wanna do anything and I just feel numb. This medication is either a hit or miss and for me, it’s a complete miss.",Kai
1,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 25, 2021",0,"I have anxiety with depression and panic attacks. I got first Zoloft 50 mg, and Olenzapine 5 mg. Didn't worked. 3 Weeks ago, my doctor prescribed me 100 mg Zoloft and Oxcarbazepine 300 mg , 3x1. Worked as I woke up from long dream. Also doesn't interfered with other medications (0.5 mg Klonazepam, Olenzapine 5, medical marijuana). Need about 2-3 days to work properly in daily dose of 900 mg. Do not take alcohol with it.",Sarajevsky
2,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 19, 2021",1,"I've only been using it for a week but my anxiety is already noticably better. I started on 150mg and now I'm up to 300, and will increase it to 450 in aday or so. Even after the first time I took it, my anxiety was much more manageable. I usually tend to overthink and be paranoid about every little thing around me but this has helped so much with that. I've been able to talk to friends on the phone and I'm usually too afraid to do that. It feels like a huge weight was taken off of my shoulders. One issue that might be a problem for some people is it can be hard to concentrate on one thing unless you really want to. It's easy to just go into autopilot and let your mind roam free.",gary5367
3,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 18, 2021",1,"It was horrible, increased my anxiety, and gave me night sweats as well as paranoia.",Ricola
4,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 3, 2021",2,"I’ve been on this medication for probably 5-6 years now. I can’t remember the initial side effects but they obviously weren’t too terrible. It certainly isn’t the best thing I’ve taken for anxiety (Cymbalta) but definitely not the worst (too many to name). It’s best used, in my case, paired with something like an SSRI or SNRI. It’s a nice backdrop that helps with mood balance. I don’t have bipolar but my anxiety can be off the charts. I also take Clonopin, between 1 to 2mg a day, usually at night. At one point I thought maybe it’s efficacy had waned and started to lower my dose. That’s when I realized how much it had helped with things like insomnia or social anxieties. Watch your salt levels as I was low on salt and my psych relayed that Oxcar can be a factor. Best of luck. If it doesn’t work, please don’t give up!! It took me a while to find a great trio of medications but I have and it has changed my life. Xo",EmmaLeigh80
5,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 17, 2021",13,"Oxcarbazepine made my anxiety go away. I was a mess of rumination, severe worrying, couldn’t sleep, worrying about the future, and had thoughts of suicide daily because I was so depressed. My doctor prescribed this but I was skeptical. Now I take 300 mg once daily at night. It has changed my life. I will never stop taking it if I don’t have to. I’ve been on it for 2 years, and all those symptoms are gone! It never made me feel sick, just sleepy, so I take it at night. I wish I had gotten help sooner. I didn’t do myself any favors as I went on YouTube watching people get sick from taking it, so I was scared to try it. None of that happened to me. Within about a week I was feeling better. Note, I also take 10 mg of Lexapro daily. I split it in half and take 5 mg in morning, and the other 5 in the evening. I started taking Lexapro first, but nothing really happened to help. Once I started the Oxcarbazepine, that’s when things changed for the better.",Sarah
6,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 5, 2021",2,"I've had a lot of meds in my time to treat anxiety, but this one is by far the least effective medicine so far. No noticeable side effects for me, but my anxiety actually worsened while on it. This med may work fine for other things, but it doesn't when it comes to anxiety.",Z
7,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,5.0,,"June 17, 2021",5,It worked well for me for 6 months and out of no where I started have melt downs again and I have now been switched medications.

9,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 26, 2021",38,"I used Trileptal for anxiety and had to stop it because I got to where I couldn’t remember ANYTHING, not even the next word I was trying to say to form a sentence. My whole thought process had become nonexistent! My boyfriend said that he noticed a change in me about 8-9 months ago and saw me go from being anxious to someone that was just a slug that couldn’t form a sentence or hold a conversation that made sense. I had asked my psychiatrist about it, but she didn’t say or do anything. She just recently passed away from a recurring illness and the psychiatrist that filled her spot took me off of it and it’s been a day and a half and I feel like I woke up and I’m alive and can just hear and see better, like I was living in a huge brain fog it seems. I feel like a normal person again and am working on regaining my thoughts!",Suzy

I was better maybe 1-2.5 weeks and then suddenly I got worse. My therapist upped my dose and I have continually gotten worse. I’ve only now realized that it is because of this medication. I have tremors, sleep problems, agitation, obsessive thoughts, my mind races, mood swings, the list goes on and on. I’m hoping to get taken off of this and that it is a smooth transition.",G

12,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,6.0,,"November 7, 2019",65,"I have been on oxycarbazine for about a year now, I have to say it worked GREAT for my anxiety for the first 3 months.  It stabilized my mood, as in I didn't flip out on stupid, or small things. I didn't have anxiety at all, I got excited that I could go food shopping!! I know that sounds stupid but I've been battling severe depression and anxiety for over 4 years now. I had an accident almost 5 years ago and it left me crippled. Since then I have slowly gotten worse. I never had anxiety before in my life, never even understood",Bebegurl
13,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,3.0,,"October 27, 2019",33,"I have RRMS. In April I had another brain MRI. The results indicated a new brain lesion on my brain.  2 EEGs were also administered. My neurologist stated I was not experiencing vertigo, but possibly having seizures, convulsions or fainting spells.  I was placed on Oxcarbazepine, 300x 2 a day. I am now experiencing extreme anxiety. My neurologist first thought the anxiety stemmed from the steroids and it would go away. It hasn't and it has only gotten worst.  He now states it is my MS. I am using cannabis for the anxiety. Sometimes it helps and other times it does not. The neurologist prescribed low dosage (2mgs) of valium. I've taken it, on and off, yet sometimes it is not effective. I am concerned about addiction to Valium. I am forgetting things. I have tingling, numbness and feeling hot inside of my body. I went from being a very independent active person to doing very little. Is anyone else experiencing extreme anxiety due to Oxcarbazepine?",Palante54
14,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 18, 2019",9,"I’ve been on this medicine oxcarbazepine for about a month. Along with Busbar and Zoloft. I have noticed I haven’t been as depressed since starting this medicine but I still have my days. Honestly I don’t think it’s the right medicine for me though. I’ve had increased anxiety, restlessness at night, dizziness, anger, headaches, and somewhat feeling out of my mind. I was prescribed this for bipolar disorder which I still haven’t been fully diagnosed with.",Maddie
15,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,5.0,,"August 21, 2019",8,"I am also taking an SSRI, phenobarbital, Dilantin, and gabapentin.  A well-controlled epileptic who also has a history of depression and GAD. The polytherapy increases the odds of side effects from Trileptal, which may play into my case.Trileptal was started ~ 2 years ago and slowly titrated upwards up to 1,800 mg/day. The drug lessened my anxiety levels and symptoms, but I have experienced many of the side effects.  Hyponatremia, lethargy, slowing of my thought processes-particularly recall of facts, ataxia, and numbness of the fingers. I also experienced intermittent nystagmus.Currently at 1,200 mg/day, treating the low Na conservatively, and am considering lowering the dose further, but I also want to keep the anxiety in-check. It’s a difficult challenge.In summary, I am rating this medication as a five. It has worked or me, but I am not sure the side effects are worth it.  I do have a good psychiatrist and he has been aware and supportive of all of the adjustments.",John Doe

I actually am starting to feel emotions, other than depression and anxiety. So far, for me, this is a wonder drug. Am on 150 mg nightly, will be increasing to 300 mg tomorrow. I am 50 y.o. , and have multiple allergies, so my psychiatrist is being careful.",Sparhawk
17,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 17, 2018",47,"Amazing effects on my borderline paranoid rage. Ask for a low dose if you're trying it! Doctors prescribe this at 600-1200 mg regularly, from what I understand, but my out-of-control rage is well-controlled on 300-450 mg daily and I don't get any of the crazy side effects people complain of. I don't understand why doctors are so eager to dump unnecessary amounts into people. What could be helpful becomes too difficult to deal with because of side effects.I've been on this medicine before and it works amazingly. I never should have gone off it, but I mistakenly thought I had better control now. This medicine changed my life.",Friendly puppy

21,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 30, 2017",27,"18 year old Female- I have been taking oxcarbazepine (trileptal) for almost 3 years now ( for my PTSD), and while it does help manage my PTSD I experience some unsettling side effects daily such as nausea, fatigue , and recently I was diagnosed with chronic hyponatremia which my doctor has link to my oxcarbazepine because it lowers your serum sodium levels in your blood. Within the last 4 months  I have started having acute migraines if I take my trileptal even so little as ten minutes late. In my opinion the long term effects are not worth the decent level off PTSD management. My doctor is thinking of changing my mediation due to the negative effects on my health.",Vivica
22,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,1.0,,"May 12, 2017",16,"I told my doctor I have been allergic 2 like every single med I have ever been prescribed except benzos meds some sleeping meds. Lack of sleep can really imbalance the brain. Doctors have just thrown random diagnoses at me forever and I have almost died in the past from lots of them. My new doctor has tried me now on 2 antiseizure meds she says to fix anxiety - I had severe reactions to both. The first one, Lorazapam, I felt I was going to die of diarrhea  (it's a bipolar med) and I swear I felt bipolar for the first time in my life from it. This new one Oxcarbazepine made me feel just NUTS immediately. I was doing great with the benzos and sleeping meds then popped an Oxcarbazepine and feel disoriented super depressed like my mind is scramble restless",Casslove
23,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 19, 2017",49,My son's in his late teens and has anxiety and A.D.D.  He had also gone through episodes of depression.  Other prescription drugs left him zombie like.  Oxcarbazepine has been a miracle drug for him.  It took about 2 months to get to the right dosage.  Please keep in mind everyone is different.  He was only allowed to move dosage up once a week then every 3 days after a few weeks.  Yes he felt tired for 1-2 months but after a few months he says it's life changing and we haven't seen him this happy in years.  He's been taking it for  almost a year now with no problems. He takes 200mg caffeine for his ADD and it calms him down so he's doing great in college.,happyme
24,Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 4, 2017",62,"My main issue was facing depression for years and took several antidepressants in the past. I don't have bipolar, but my psychiatrist decided to try a mood stabilizer for the first time since antidepressants weren't working and since I tried to commit suicide for the 2nd time a few months back. Trileptal has completely took away my depression. Even when I hit a bump in the road, I'm not even close to the person I was a few months ago. I'm able to work 6 days a week, have more energy, and my thoughts of suicide are no longer present. Having a BA in psychology I want to add that meds are not a ""cure"", but sometimes it is better than wanting to take your life and at least be an aid to help you get back on track.",Psych Undergrad

I have been dealing with acute alcohol withdrawal disorder and have had anxiety and depression for many years. The drs have tried to label me as bi polar, but  I don't think it's an accurate dx. Since taking this pill I have had vivid nightmares upon the first night taking it. I felt some relief initially and felt good for a week or so. I had my ups and downs. I took the pill without reading side affects, so that it would not affect my treatment. I have had a constant sore throat, crusty sores on my nose that won't go away. I feel drunk when I take them.

I have tried antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and other anticonvulsants. None of them did the job. I tried this, expecting very little. I am amazed at how wonderfully this treats my issues. When I take it, it does take a while for it to take effect, but once it does, my restlessness and agitation completely vanishes. I love it because it doesn't make me feel any differently, I just suddenly notice that I'm sitting still and my mind is going a hundred miles an hour. Medications affect everyone differently, but this one works wonders for me!!",jayndoe7

There were some medicines over the years that helped, but for one reason or another, I had to stop taking them.

Very disturbing, and my sleep was never restful from that day forward. Four different polysomnograms verified I was getting less than a third of normal REM sleep.  Six months ago I discovered Ambien and was quite pleased, but I was recently to see a pain management doctor who understands the value of good sleep in dealing with chronic pain; his preference is Trileptal so I went on it.
