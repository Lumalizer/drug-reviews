1,Clonazepam,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 26, 2022",0,"I recently started taking Clonazepam for my anxiety attacks. It works well, except for the drowsiness I feel throughout the day. At least it is helping me sleep and is working well for my anxiety. However, from past few days I'm experiencing nightmares. It had stopped but it's back again. I still don't understand if it's the med or what.",Hinata
2,Clonazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 7, 2022",11,"I have suffered from anxiety on and off throughout my life depending on circumstances going on around me.  With the last 2+ years , lockdowns, isolation, starting a new job I found a slow buildup coming for a while and it finally hit me about a month ago.  I take Zoloft but when I get really bad Klonopin is an absolute life saver, LITERALLY.  I just try to limit when and how I take it.  I read my body and if it is evening time and I feel my panic and stress level rising and know I won't sleep I take a .5mg and it helps very quickly.  The physical toll anxiety has on your body to me is far worse than needing a helpful medication.  I do not know where I would be without it and I am 52 years old now.  I still do positive things like meditation, exercise, eat well, and no alcohol, as well as a stress counselor.   I feel this medication is the best solution for anxiety.   I hope this post helps someone.",Guitpack
3,Clonazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 5, 2022",1,"I was first prescribed clonazepam in 1991 for anxiety/PTSD after unpleasant experience with Xanax (too euphoric, wild dreams), and have taken it on an ad hoc basis since. There have been years when I have not needed to take it at all, and when I have felt I have needed it then I have dosed 0.25 mg or even less, followed by another 0.25mg if more needed. I've never taken a full 1mg tablet and doctor's have told me I can be less cautious, but the small doses work for me. It has always made the difference, and very often it's been enough just to have it to hand and knowing that I can take it if needed.",fava

6,Clonazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 25, 2022",0,"There is a drug metabolizing / genetic test for people to take, to make sure any potential medication can be correctly metabolized without an issue. I feel this is important to know before you introduce anything into your system. I suspect this might have to do with certain people not being able to correctly get rid of the drug, so it hangs around too long which can cause withdrawal or addiction issues. Personally, I have no complaints with this medication and my experience using it has truly allowed me to live my life. I have been on and off of it for many years, taking it as needed. I used to use it daily when I was in the military and had no issues coming off after continuous use for 2 years. As of today it's only as I need it. I understand people have / had issues with this medication but please get a drug metabolizing test to see which medications will work correctly for you. This will be the missing link for many. Be well....",SeaShell
7,Clonazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 24, 2022",1,"After an accident I suffered multiple spinal fractures then two spinal fusion surgeries, I became very withdrawn depressed and anxious after the injury changed my life. I was unable to work as a nurse and the pain was unbearable, I became a recluse after being a very active, fit, healthy and fun person. I began having panic attacks my anxiety was unbearable. I was given 0.5 clonazapam  to take as needed. 0.25 - 0.5. I had tried beta blockers but they didn’t really help. Clonazapam literally saved my life.it takes about 15 mins to work, I can still function. it has just given me enough of a break from the relentless anxiety to be able to function again. I feel calm and so much better. No side effects at all apart from if I stop taking it for around 6 days then I can feel withdrawal symptoms which are not pleasant.

8,Clonazepam,Anxiety,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 22, 2022",1,"I know everyone’s experience is different. So I know for a lot of people this has helped. I want to preface this by saying I already have terrible anxiety and depression before I started this. The first time I took it, it was amazing I felt so calm an at ease. I took it twice in November, twice in December. Once or twice in January and I have taken it once per week the last 3 weeks. I am unsure if my condition is worsening or if the meds are worsening my depression. But the days after taking them lately I’ve been in extreme turmoil. It’s been excruciating depression and cognitive impairment. To be on the safe side I’m gonna try to stay off for good and try something that works more long term",johnathanellison88

One day I had the worst panic attack believing I was dying I knew it was it! I couldn't breathe, numb, I was stopped in my tracks. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder. My fight or flight kicked in and never kicked out. I was prescribed clonazapam .5 twice a day. I take .5 a day and it helps me so much. Forget about what they say about addiction.

It took my anxiety and whisked it away like a hawk hovering overhead and about to devour its prey. Normalcy was a spell cast by a potion made up of medicine, contentment and confidence. The truth with this drug is we learn to like things that changes is for the better. If you stop taking it it would bring on bad symptoms made up of fear and uncertainty. Why risk that?

I still had lingering anxiety and worst of all depression.They reduced anxiety by a lot and helped with PTSD symptoms. But I have found other benzodiazepines to have better anxiolytic effects for me. I am tolerant to sedation.I have changed to Diazepam and the difference for me is noticeable. With the same tolerance I am finding PTSD symptoms I experience to be much less intense. I am no longer depressed and I have no underlying anxiety. I wish I was taking Diazepam from the start. But everyone is different.",Years of XP
17,Clonazepam,Anxiety,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 4, 2021",0,"I was prescribed 1 mg Clonazepam for one year. I took it occasionally, in order to stray from addiction. Although it did relieve some anxiety, I still found myself constantly worrying. It was helpful in highly stressful situations and created a calming effect that lasted well over a day. However, it did not tackle my anxiety entirely. Also, after a single dose, a week later, I would experience horrible rebound effects such as rapid heartbeat, a racing mind, and amplified anxiety. I took this medication once or twice every other week and sometimes, once or twice a month. I found this medication wasn’t for me. I did not enjoy feeling like I was withdrawing after a single dosage. I had a similar experience with Ativan but the onset of rebound anxiety after a single dosage with that happened a day or two later. I asked my doctor to switch me back to Alprazolam XR which works fairly similar to Clonazepam without the rebound effects. I also feel it tackles my anxiety completely and subtly.",Patient
18,Clonazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 1, 2021",3,"It's really a shame how Klonopin is so hard to get for the people that need it most.  The internet is plastered with scare tactics and for profit drug rehabs to get off the benzos.  People that need to take it for a range of medical and physiological reasons are also put in a bad light.And on the same token, I don't think it is a wonder drug either.  But it has gotten me through some very dark times where anxiety is through the roof.  I take as little as I need, which is usually 1mg a day but I'm prescribed up to 3mg if needed; and sometimes it's needed.It's just easier for doctors to cycle people through different SSRI's/antidepressants and hope one sticks or the patient is ""cured"" through placebo effect of taking a pill.  I got no relief at all from trying so many of them:  Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Busphirone, the list goes on and on.  Side effect after side effect.

20,Clonazepam,Anxiety,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 19, 2021",0,"In response to some of the experiences below where people have hailed clonazepam as a miracle drug then have been taken off the medication only to find they are unable to sleep and/or control anxiety without the medication. Significant changes to GABA neurotransmission can occur with prolonged use of benzodiazepines like Clonazepam. The medical concerns with prolonged use are dependence, cognitive problems, and sleep problems. When under the influence of benzodiazepines, patient's perceive that they sleep better but the reality is that they do not get into deep, restorative stages of sleep (stages 3 and 4). Benzodiazepines have amnestic properties as well as anxiolytic properties meaning patients often forget that their sleep was disturbed or restless when in reality their sleep was restless and disturbed. From a psychiatric standpoint, using benzodiazepines as a coping mechanism for anxiety can reinforce incorrect beliefs and feelings that lead to inordinate amounts of anxiety.",psych provider

But here I am, today, 3 weeks sober, without any withdrawal symptoms at all! Let me share my story in brief, hoping it can help someone leave this poison.Timeline: May-Aug (4months)Week one and two: 1.5mg (cut off 0.5mg)Week three and four: 1mgWeek five and six: 0.5mgWeek seven and eight: 0.25mgAfter this, I started dividing 0.25mg into so many parts and started taking one of them daily so that the body knows it’s being feeded with clonazepam.After two weeks, I started tasting it, just a bit. And then taste it again after 3 days. Then 4 days. Gradually took it to a week. And then it stopped. Not feeling anything since 3 weeks now. Mind you this slow tapering reduces withdrawal symptoms to a minimum hence there were slight heart palpitations sometime, or pain in jaws or anxiety, but not much.Best wishes!",Sana Khan
24,Clonazepam,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 23, 2021",1,Originally prescribed lorazepam as a when required dose of 1-3 mg a day for panic disorder and PTSD 3 years ago I developed not only a dependency but a tolerance. My GP didn't seem to get and it's effects became so short acting I was on a rollercoaster. Ended up at a drug clinic where I was carefully moved to a dose of clonazepam 1mg day/night. The withdrawal from lorazepam was the worst experience. Never take that stuff.... the clonazepam is working great. Almost feel normal. I can do so much more with reduced anxiety levels and now looking at reducing dose gradually to drop benzos altogether although I'm advised that could take up to a year and I could end up on an ssri. Happy in the clorazepam space right now. Guess time will tell. I'm 60 and have suffered from panic disorder and PTSD since my 30s.,Robert

Withdrawal was horrible.  Ended up in a Psych emergency room. They gave me Ativan, 11 of them. Would give me no more. I had to quit ( Cold Turkey) I suffered for months. High blood pressure.  Social anxiety,  tinnitus,  and now I'm left with tinnitus,  low blood pressure,  and general weakness. I never feel good anymore.  I'm 75, was and I think,  still am relatively healthy. But every little pain or bump is heart disease or cancer. I really can't go on like this so I'm seriously thinking of going back on the klonapin.  I'm 75, let's be realistic.  What do I have left? 5...10 years if I'm lucky. I never took high doses, max maybe 1mg. A few days a week, but I never felt better. My gut problems, including an anal fistula were tolerable.

27,Clonazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 15, 2021",1,"I have social anxiety and developed a coping mechanism of OCD type of cleaning to calm the anxiety. This precursor worked for some time until I went to college and discovered alcohol. Now I had my OCD cleaning and alcohol. Not until after having my kids at the age of 40 did I finally face myself and realized I had a serious problem. I felt completely overwhelmed, and my husband and I were going at this alone. He worked full time so it was really me going at it alone. I was an out of control alcoholic, that used alcohol to deal with my anxiety of having OCD. I checked myself into rehab. MAPP test to find the right dose of meds to work (clnzpm & prozac). 10 years later the conjunction of these two drugs treated my OCD and anxiety. The dosage is 0.5 mg 2x a day for the clnzpm & has not changed. Clnzpm worked a miracle for me. I did not feel high, I just felt balanced. The stigma regarding this drug is unfair.

My baby brother died in 2020 and if it wasn't for klonopin, I would have had a nervous breakdown. Then I needed a pacemaker. Thank goodness for this medicine. Then my mom was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer in both breast. If it wasn't for this medication, I know that aneurysm would have ruptured by now from the stress and critical blood pressure.

I am presently 70 years old and I still take it.  2mg a day.  That is not generally acceptable because of early dementia.  I am perfectly cognitive and I have no fear of some remote possibility.

There's better drugs for a bona fide anxiety disorder but I'm seeing where they're an anticonvulsant.  Benzos have been demonized because of the meth epidemic and opiate overdoses plaguing the country and doctors are hip to pill shopping.  All states now have the prescription drug registry which has been catching people since its implementation.

44,Clonazepam,Anxiety,9.0,,"July 20, 2021",9,"Hello. I am 19 years old and have been diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, C-PTSD, and severe anxiety results from both. Benzodiazepines are extremely hard to get. I had to list the 20+ medications that I have been on plus a referral from my therapist to be able to take Clonazepam. As I suffer severe side effects from SSRI's and other medications used to treat anxiety, it was not treated for over 6+ years. Clonazepam is a wonderful benzodiazepine. Yes, benzos can be dangerous, but from someone who has severe anxiety, this medication has been a lifesaver. I can take 0.5MG a day total. This medication works within an hour, and the effects linger for up to 12-15 hours, providing all day coverage. I keep tolerance low by only taking it as needed or every 3-4 days. My blood pressure and heart rate sit lower, I can breathe, and it has helped tremendously with physical pain. If you want a long-acting benzodiazepine, I would choose Klonopin.",Matt

48,Clonazepam,Anxiety,9.0,,"June 23, 2021",6,"Been taking 0.25 as and when needed for anxiety provoking situations at work. Was a little apprehensive at first due to addiction, but as far, not felt the need for a daily dosage.What I have found is that it allows me to think straight and has a calming effect from both a mental and physical point of view. No blushing, shakey voice, intense heart pounding and completely removes the feeling of needing to 'get out'.Little has been said about consuming alcohol whilst on this medication, and although this is obviously a big no no per doctor instructions, I have found a  drink with a meal has little to no impact, at least for me anyway. If anything, it has completely slowed down alcohol consumption which I would have previously turned to to deal with anxiety inducing social situations.Taking .25 first thing in the morning I am finding relaxation and sleep much easier to come by even after 12 hours of taking.",Leighton_Grey

This medication is the best thing I have ever used for my anxiety. I have never had any success with antidepressants, (I've tried all classes) they all made me sick and more anxious and some even caused serotonin syndrome (which clonazepam saved me from too) This medication helps me to learn how to grow from my anxiety, to help me sleep better, and most of all works amazing.

Don't rush to one every time you feel a little anxious.  But don't be afraid of something that can help you tremendously!Xanax worked the best for me and helped with anxious depression too.

Xanax is too much for me and Ativan was perfect). Now I’ve moved to 20mg diazepam po (2x daily)(≈2mg clonazepam 2x daily). Hoping the diazepam works out as nothing worked better than the Ativan but it was the one I stayed on the shortest.

Cons: It impairs my memory a little bit and makes me a bit sleepy.  Also, if I take it too many days in a row or at higher dosages, I experience depressive symptoms, namely a lack of motivation and trouble feeling pleasure. All in all, if you have really intense anxiety that hinders your ability to function in daily life, I'd recommend this medication.

It didn't relax me or anything but compared to many other medicine it took a couple points from my chronic pain in the right side of the face. Not a miracle drug for me but not immediate side-effects compared to others so I kept using it. For ODT specifically I would develop small clear bumps (mouth ulcers) under my tongue and on the insides of the cheeks. They would go away after few days but one stayed there for over a year. I had to do punch biopsy on it. When I tried to lookup if anyone else have such symptoms I couldn't find anything. So I'm posting it here. If you try to switch the location of where the ODT dissolves a couple days later a new clear bump will be there. The drug blocks minor salivary glands which we have a few hundreds all over the mouth.

Let me start off by saying I only gave it 8 stars because, yes, your body does become addicted to it. I ran out. Once. Tried this mindfulness junk for a week before it hit me like a truck. Next thing I know I go from ok to in the ER getting injections of Ativan for my BP being 180/140 and Heart rate off the charts. After the Ativan I was perfect in 10 minutes with a BP of 117/80 and 80 pulse.THAT being said, there’s no denying the drug works. And it works pretty darn good. I had a heart attack at 30 years old. After that experience I developed GAD and it just gotten worse over time. Unfortunately, Klonopin is the only drug that keeps this under control. The fact my BP and heart rate are directly affected by my anxiety condition makes it a double edged sword. I’ve been on it 2 years now at .5mg twice daily.  Yeah, you’ll feel a little woozy until your body adjusts, but it will go away.",StrayCat59
98,Clonazepam,Anxiety,8.0,,"January 13, 2020",25,"This is my second review for Clonazepam. As I stated before, I’ve only used it (for the past 8 years) on an as needed basis with favorable results. I do, however believe that this medication is not for everyone! My mother was prescribed this after my dad passed away suddenly and she had a not so favorable experience-brain fog, auditory hallucinations which obviously increased her anxiety. She had similar experiences when she tried Xanax.   It’s a shame that Clonozepam has caused some individuals nightmarish results!! Clearly people react differently with this either taking it and/or weaning off of it. As others reviewers have stated, some have little or no problems with weaning and others are thrown into a tail spin that put them in the hospital. You really don’t know how your body will respond to it. My heart goes out to the people who are still struggling with the aftermath of this medication!",Marie
99,Clonazepam,Anxiety,9.0,,"January 4, 2020",48,"This has been a life saver for me. I went down a spiral of depression and self destructive behaviour and was very resistant to see a doctor which made things worse. Also, I was scared of the ""fame"" that follows this substance. Once I decided to see a doctor and started the recommended dose - 0.5mg three times a day - life changed in a very acute way: intrusive thoughts were diminished, concentration went up and productivity went back to what it was before depression set in. It's been 4 years on it at the same dosage. This and the anti-depressant saved my life, once I was on the verge of suicide. Nowadays I allow myself to skip dosages on a few days without any signs of malaise. I can't say my experience is a textbook example of what it does, but in my personal experience I may say it was fundamental to avoid something worse. In my country the recommended treatment limit is about 12 weeks; I'm well past that and, as I mentioned, I'm able to take drug holidays without negative effects.",JConrad

I take gabapentin 600 mgs daily (two doses at 300 mgs each, am one and pm one).  It calms me and has made this much easier.

It's kept me from killing myself because I thought I'd never be able to escape the anxiety. I'd only recommend it if you've tried SSRIs and they haven't helped, and your anxiety is unbearably severe.",Nicki

It's a quick and easy relief during an anxiety/panic attack. Or just general anxiety. But there are severe consequences if taken for a longer period of time and or on a regular basis.BE CAUTIOUS with this medication. It shouldn't be taken regularly and longer than a couple months at MOST. I strongly hold the belief it should only be taken alongside therapeutic treatment.I've been on Clonazepam for 2 years. I'm down to .75 now. But the withdrawals are absolutely the worst thing I could describe a human being could experience. The last 2 years have been a weird personality blur, which I haven't been aware of until recently.Overall for mental health conditions, I'd say seek therapy; not a pill to make you forget about your worries.

She prescribed clonazepam for anxiety which I’ve taken in the past with no problems at all. (Also meds for bipolar and PTSD) The anxiety from the lightning strike has altered my life completely. I’m obsessed with monitoring the weather and will not leave the house if I know a storm is coming. I’m constantly reliving the strike and I live in an area where it storms regularly.

It works very well for chronic anxiety disorder and  sudden onsets of severe panic attacks. Knowing what I know now, I wish with all my being it had never ever been prescribed to me, and without the absurd nonchalance dozens of practitioners have portrayed. I'm 32 and have been prescribed clonazopam for 14 years. Ive been in situations where my health insurance is in transition and I must go off the medication abruptly-- this is when I realized how deep I was. Weeks upon weeks of non stop physical, emotional, and psychological withdrawal effects that are like hell. Words cannot accurately describe just how awful it is. This, again, has been my experience during withdrawal as a long term clonazopam patient. All skin, especially the face, becomes numb. Vision gets fuzzy and difficult to see clearly. Panic attacks become extremely exasperated, frequent and debilitating. Severe irritability. Worst of all: a terrifying disconnection between your mind and body; as if you're an onlooker watching and feeling this horrible thing happen to you, but not actually feeling connected to any of it-- that one is tough to explain. All of this... It can lasts months, maybe more. That's right. Not just some one week hump to overcome. After finding how awful the withdrawal is I've been attempting to ween very very slowly down from 3 2mg doses per day to eventually zero, hopefully. After six months of gradually decreases in dose I'm now at 2- 1mg doses per day and I'm not sure how or if I can go much less than that. No doctors I've had have been of any help. The ween down was my idea and the rate of it was also my idea based on experience. It sure would be nice to meet a doctor that truly had knowledge of this withdrawal syndrome and took it a bit more seriously. I am confident that the medication is no longer treating my anxiety disorder, but simply preventing withdrawal from the meds themselves. And there don't seem to be any good alternatives. It's a long road ahead, please think it over and over with someone knowledgeable before being so quick to embrace this miracle drug. The truth is that most of us actually need very real psychotherapy, not chemicals that run our lives. Once again, all my point of view from my personal experience.

I have had some lapses in taking the prescribed amount for a couple days of which I paid for with loss of sleep but with any negatives I've found for this drug the positives have outweighed the negatives significantly.

There is literally no way to be anxious on a high enough dose, and benzos will be your saving grace if you are suffering from several panic attacks a day or even if you're catatonic. It's also got a pretty good record for being safe, far as I know.Here's the bad part. Any drug that works too well, that allows you to feel too good on it, runs a high risk of dependency. Not only that, withdrawal from this drug is miserable and painful if not done currently and under supervision.
