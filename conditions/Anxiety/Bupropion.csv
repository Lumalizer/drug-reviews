0,Bupropion,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 1, 2022",0,"Absolute God Send!!! I have tried so many antidepressants with no luck. I’ve tried Lexapro , Celexa, Cymbalta, Zoloft + Gabapentin , Prozac, and a few others with Xanax. Nothing has worked for my social anxiety except this ! I’m taking 300mg of Wellbutrin XR and never felt better. It’s almost as if my anxiety just vanished like I don’t understand it. I no longer fear phone calls, ordering food, or  jogging outside. I literally just go about my day, that’s it. No anxiety and it just returned orgasms. TG!",Anxious toast
1,Bupropion,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2022",0,"Words cannot express how morbidly zombie-like I feel while on Buproprion. I've stuck it out as long as I can with this medication and I just can't do it anymore without serious fear for my wellbeing. Today is Day 1 of not taking it (brought on by last night's horrible sleep episode, which I'll talk about in the second paragraph) and I'm hoping with all of my heart that it doesn't take long to get back to feeling normal again. Severe insomnia, waking up frantically from dreams, no help for the anxiety which it was initially prescribed for, increased appetite, etc. I can't do it anymore. I could write a really, really long story about how bad this medication has been for me since I began taking it.If it works for you, kudos, but it has been a nightmare for me.",Mrs. Negan
2,Bupropion,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 24, 2022",0,"I had been taking this medication to treat anxiety (not depression) for symptoms like overthinking rapid heart rate trouble sleeping stress etc… This medication made everything much worse for obvious reasons. Gave me migraines, achy muscles, extremely rapid heart rate, sleepiness, foggy brain, irritability, mood swings, extreme anxiety and sadness. I think if you are depressed and always tired and unmotivated this could be amazing for you. However, do not take it to treat anxiety!! It was horrible!! It’s not meant for anxiety so don’t try it.",Bupropion SR
3,Bupropion,Anxiety,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 25, 2022",0,"This did not work for me. In fact, it actually made me depressed. This is because I was not depressed when I was taking it; it was prescribed to help with anxiety. Which it did not help with that. I find when you take a medication for a condition that you do not have, it ends up making you HAVE that condition. For example: adderall counteracts hyperness in people who need it. When people use it who don’t need it, it makes them hyper. Odd, eh? Either way, I’m sure wellbutrin could be great for people who could truly benefit from it",Anonfemale
4,Bupropion,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 17, 2022",0,"Too early to tell but I had worse experiences on other antidepressants for anxiety. Sexual dysfunction which can lead to permanent erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, or something I have experienced as well as others, numbness of the penis (lack of sensation). So be careful with SSRI meds especially long-term use. Now let me continue. I spoke to a new psychiatrist and she did an evaluation and suggested I may have ADD (overfocused, anxious type). There are 7 types of ADD. For some unknown reason, my mind is calmer and focused when on meds (dopaminergic type) like stimulants as well. Wellbutrin can have many adverse effects like insomnia as well as anxiety. It is the epinephrine in the med that raises anxiety levels but should subside with time as your body adjusts to it. I am also on a low dose of Focalin XR also. I don't blame my insomnia on this med but on the withdrawal from Klonopin. I will post another review in 6 weeks.",IamBarry
5,Bupropion,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 21, 2021",1,"I was on and off Lexapro for around 2 years until I decided to switch medications. My new psychiatrist recommended this for my anxiety disorder (even though theres very limited evidence of it being effective for it) and at first I felt pretty good when I was weaning off Lexapro and taking Wellbutrin. After I stopped Lexapro the anxiety came back. Wellbutrin makes sleeping harder and I have noticed a lot of anxiety traits like paranoia, clammy hands and getting those nervous stomach turns coming back. I was surprised to find out that a medication that is related to amphetamines is described for anxiety. As someone, with an anxiety disorder, who has tried Ritalin (recreationally), I know that stimulating drugs are the worst for people with anxiety. Wellbutrin doesn’t seem to work for anxiety, could work for depression though.",n_jjj
6,Bupropion,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 15, 2021",0,"I was prescribed bupropion 100mg SR and I felt it work almost immediately that day. I absolutely loved being on this medication: I lost weight, didn’t have anxiety or panic attacks anymore, had some pretty awesome dreams, had an increased sex drive and felt more focused at work. It really helped some of my low key ADHD symptoms as well.  Until day 15…On day 15, my first hive appeared on my wrist. Three days later and I’m covered in hives head to two and all of my joints are swollen. Apparently there’s a rare side effect for hives and swelling that occurs 15-28 days into the medication regimen. I’m so sad I have to stop using bupropion. It was like a miracle drug for my mind and body.",MoGo22
7,Bupropion,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 15, 2021",2,"Well the first two weeks I had bad panic attacks then they stopped. Before I started taking it everyday I felt like I couldn’t breath and my heart would race. I suffered like that for 5 years in and out of the emergency room thinking I’m dying because I’m afraid of medicine. I only trust ativan but that’s not safe to take every day so I would suffer. Now I haven’t had a panic attack in a month but during my period I did start getting them so I had to take some ativan I’m a little spacey sometimes but it’s better than racing thoughts I feel more happy and calm didn’t gain weight or lose weight.  Any other kind of pill for this makes you gain weight that’s also why I suffered, I do not want to. So my advice is try it if you can get through the first two weeks it’s smooth sailing",Rebecca
8,Bupropion,Anxiety,6.0,,"December 14, 2021",0,"I quit very quickly Paxil because the negative sexual effects. I entered in a withdrawal of that. Then I started to take bupropion because the lack of sexual side effects. Either Paxil, lexapro, escitalopran, Bupropion, etc, none of any antidepressants have a huge impact on anxiety. Unfortunately the only thing that take away anxiety symtoms are benzodiazapines or sedative supplements. There is no one pill that produces relaxation and good mood at the same time, you'll need two. You can have all the serotonine and dopamine in the world but if you suffer from anxiety you will be a happy anxious person. Forget the idea of relax with an anti depressant...",MatiasC

That edge you constantly have with anxiety, poof… gone. I’m more energetic and upbeat, I have laughed more this month than I have in years. My spirits are lifted and everything is just better, I am functioning much much better with it. I have lost a little bit of weight without trying, one of the side effects. I read about was getting acne with this medicine but mine is actually clearing up!! Another thing I was so hopeful this med would help with is my libido and ohhh my goodness, it has! My dr started me off with 150mg and said we’d go to 300mg if I felt I would benefit from it and I do think I would because unfortunately it hadn’t done a thing for my ADHD like I hoped.. thats the only downfall though. Over all, love this stuff and my life is changing. So glad I finally asked my dr for help!",Ahhmazing
10,Bupropion,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 3, 2021",0,"My doctor switched me to this pill because the first depression pill was not working for me. I am now on bupropion and I feel so sad. Have suicidal thoughts which I never had. I feel so depressed even more than I ever did. I feel unworthy of life, I feel like a horrible parent...I feel useless and my doctor just wants me to stay on this pill. I need a new doctor. Please, listen to yourself and what you are feeling if you are taking this pill.",I am so sad
11,Bupropion,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 26, 2021",1,"My experience with bupropion has been a mixed bag. I have GAD with severe panic attacks, as well as major depressive episodes. I’ve tried a TON of different medications for depression and they all made my anxiety and depression worse. Bupropion is the only med that has made a difference. I wanted to share that I don’t think this is a good medication for anxiety generally- causes me to be on edge, more irritable, jittery. I could not be on it if I wasn’t on several other medications for anxiety that help. I take half of a 75mg pill because I feel way too anxious at a normal dose. I got testing done and learned I metabolize drugs very slowly, which is why I take such a small dose. I’d recommend genetic testing and trying out a small dose initially if you have anxiety. Bupropion has helped my apathy and inability to get out of bed quite a lot.",Bupropion revie
12,Bupropion,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 18, 2021",6,"I could cry happy tears. I have anxiety and ocd.  I guess I didn’t realize how my life truly made me feel until I started taking bupropion. I had previously been on Effexor, which I never liked btw, and never went off because I figured that was just how my life was supposed to be. I thought all meds did the same thing, so what was the point in stopping and dealing with the side effects? One day I ran out and decided to just quit. (Don’t do this. Always talk to your doc first.) After dealing with the withdrawal for a week, I started bupropion. Another week of letting it kick in and I’ve never been happier. My mood is great and I finally feel like the person I’ve always strived to be. I always thought I was a happy person, but now I know I was always being held back by my past med. My will to do the things I want to do is back and it feels amazing to finally live my life. This med is my life saver.",Just happy
13,Bupropion,Anxiety,1.0,,"September 6, 2021",5,"I am a 40 year old man. I started using Wellbutrin XL at 150mg 6 days ago for anxiety and depression.  Unfortunately, I suffered side effects almost immediately, mild at first (a little shaky with some rapid heart beats) which progressed to extreme levels of anxiety today along with blood pressure of 140/90.  I also feel dazed, forgetful, dizzy and confused and have an intense feeling of dread.  I also couldn't get to sleep until 4am last night which is unusual for me. I have decided to stop taking this medication as its quite terrifying. I am hoping that this feeling is gone by tomorrow.  Does anyone know how long it takes to start feeling normal after stopping bupropion?",anonomous
14,Bupropion,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 25, 2021",5,"This is in response to Nancy a few post below because yes, everyone does indeed react differently. She says that she has been taking it for under a month and has been having nightmares, etc. Here is my story: I started taking Wellbutrin in a psychiatric hospital which I was admitted into for depression. I have bad anxiety. The first week of this medication was awful. I had extreme mood swings, increased heart rate, increased anxiety, vivid nightmares, etc. after that first week though, things started to slowly improve. By the third week most of the unwanted side effects had worn off and I started to feel better and better. I am now exactly 3 months into taking Wellbutrin 300mg and I could not be happier. It has truly changed my life for the better. I’m more motivated, I can concentrate better, I’m happier, more confident, all the negative thoughts are gone, I can still cry but I won’t spend an entire day being upset about something, the list goes on…I feel GOOD and STABLE!",Hazel
15,Bupropion,Anxiety,1.0,,"August 15, 2021",4,"This is the worst medication I’ve ever used in my life. I have GAD, OCD, Panic Disorder. Went on it for my ADHD and went off my citalopram. Never again. I was on it for 2.5 months and kept telling myself the side effects will go away They didn’t, it got worse and worse and I ended up afraid of everything, paranoid, delusional, mania, emotional. It felt like I wanted to cry all the time so I went back on my citalopram",Kiwii
16,Bupropion,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 2, 2021",0,"My doc suggested Wellbutrin after I had a bad experience with Zoloft. I’m a smoker and have pretty bad anxiety so she said Wellbutrin should be a good fit. The first 4 days I took it in the AM and was an emotional wreck. I literally cried all day and felt such a deep sadness. I started taking it at night and was surprised I didn’t have trouble sleeping. I was fine for two days, then I had a very frightening episode where my head tilted to the side in its own, and when I brought my head back up right, I had probably one of the worst anxiety/panic attacks of my life. I was a mess the rest of the day, so I contacted my doctor and she told me to stop taking it immediately and from what I told her, she thinks I might’ve had a seizure, and wants me to get an EEG done. It’s been a week since I stopped taking it and the last couple of days I have felt off, but today I had the worst anxiety ever. This med is awful. I’m so jealous of those who took this and it benefit them.",Kass
17,Bupropion,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 30, 2021",0,"This medicine has been a real game-changer for me. I spent several years on a few different SSRIs in order to combat my underlying, near constant anxiety and it's accompanying depression. Increased dosages and emergency/breakthrough med changes never truly seemed to help long term. I had almost forgotten what it felt like to feel ""normal"" and it is incredible. I have to be cautious about drinking too much caffeine now but that's a worthwhile trade to fell so much better.",FeelingBetter
18,Bupropion,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 30, 2021",0,"About 5 years ago, I was experiencing being snippy/ angry, also could not shut my mind off at night. I started on Citalopram 20mg every morning. It seemed to help at the beginning, but after a few months, he upped it to 40mg daily. The anxiety and irritability decreased and I was doing well. However, the sexual side effects were very troublesome for me. So over the 5 years I tried weening off of Citalopram 2x but ended up back on it as the anxiety and irritability kicked backed in. Finally in June 2021, I weened off the second time because I had no energy/motivation, etc., I asked the Dr if there was something else to try to help me in the areas I was having problems with. He wrote a Rx for Bupropion SR 150mg 2x daily. I have noticed more energy and focus so far on my 4th day of taking the drug. A little insomnia/restlessness while trying to sleep and just a weird body sensation. I have read many comments that say be patient and let your body adjust and the side effects will improve.",Beamer
19,Bupropion,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 27, 2021",0,This has been the most traumatic experience I have ever been through. I have had the absolute worst headaches to the point I feel like I am having aneurysm I feel like I am going crazy. I cannot sleep and my anxiety has increased tremendously. My right side of my temple hurts really bad and I believe I may be experiencing brain zaps. I started off with 150mg and then it was upped to 300 mg. I feel discombobulated and like I am literally going insane. I suffer from panic attacks and not depression and this has made it 400 times worst. I am so debilitated I have thought about going on short term disability. Not to mention everyone else keeps saying they are experiencing decreased in appetite and energy and I have not had the luxury of that. I yawn all day and get extremely tired around 3. I’m not saying stay away but please know the side effects can be really strong and GOOD LUCK,Yessica

21,Bupropion,Anxiety,2.0,,"May 10, 2021",7,"Been dealing with anxiety for 25 long years.  Been on citalopram makes me so tired and blahhh. Then on escitalopram I was bit tired but I gained about 30lbs, that pill caused me to be a carb craver. I went on Wellbutrin which has been 4 weeks now, the 1st week on wellbutrin at a dose o f150 was ok and the next week the dose went to 300mg.  Wow thats when the side effects hit and I started going down that dark rabbit hole.  Anxiety went through the roof, new meds are like already having a full sponge of anxiety and the meds squeezing it, the darkness that came about day 4 at 300mg was bad  lucky I read about all the side effect symptoms and kept my mind on the symptoms rather than the mind going off the rails about life sucks. The side side effects cleared up but it really hasn't done much for GAD.  I am alert yes, but the general anxiety is a slow constant, I have no more panic attacks. I have added prozac on and lowered the wellbutrin to 150mg and thus far over 5 weeks, I don't think the wellbutrin is doing much. So now I am waiting for the Prozac to kick in so good luck everyone.  Hang in there.",sj
22,Bupropion,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 24, 2021",4,"On week 5-6 of Bupropion XL. I’ve tried numerous SSRI’s for depression/anxiety but could never get through the side effects. I reached a very dark point to which my dr. prescribed the Wellbutrin to avoid the zombie feeling. Bupropion XL has pulled me completely out of that dark place and I’ve found that I don’t have any of the cravings for sweets that I used to when I would stress eat. I did experience the dry mouth but it has ceased. Only downfall is that my anxiety has seemed to increase, I’ve experienced a lot of paranoia and speaking issues/nervousness. I’ve also become extremely impatient and have little anger fits out of nowhere. It feels difficult to relax and snap out of that alert feeling. I’m staying open minded since it’s helped the depression and energy levels. If it doesn’t level out in the next month or so, I may ask my doctor if I can add a small dosage of an SSRI so that I can relax. I would avoid caffeine if your anxiety is sensitive to it.",Ashley
23,Bupropion,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 31, 2021",9,"It is amazing how varied the reviews are and it appears as though all depends on the individual. I had been on Cymbalta for my anxiety, but after a long time out of work, I became sooooo depressed that my doc added 150 mg of Wellbutrin. That saved my life (along with an excellent therapist and support of fam and friends). I am now in a great place and in the midst of reducing my Cymbalta (going from 60mg to 30 mg) and will report back any neg impact of Wellbutrin. Nothing so far. I am hoping to eliminate Cymbalta completely and eventually reduce Wellbutrin.

As a person with panic disorder and not depression, I am very unhappy with it.    My anxiety is worse, definitely not better!  This medication is going to lead me to be depressed with all of these dang panic attacks.  I also have had a really weird side effect that I can't find anything about - post-nasal drip. Constantly clearing my throat.  It is the most annoying thing ever, and just appeared when I began this medication.  My advice if you're suffering from anxiety - try something else.

26,Bupropion,Anxiety,2.0,,"March 12, 2021",1,"I’d never struggled with depression or anxiety.  The issue came about after I had debilitating panic attacks for a week straight.  I was prescribed 150mg of Bupropion XL.  I started it right away and loved the energy it gave me, but the anxiety was awful and got so much worse before it got better.  It took around 3 weeks to level off and I was able to wean off of Xanax.  For the next year I’d have 1-2 weeks of panic attacks, never for any reason.  I just figured it was normal.  A little over a year in I started to have GI issues and abdominal pain as well as an issue with my vision.  I was unable to focus.  Traffic seemed to move around me, driving was a nightmare and I was unable to control my own thoughts.  I was on  Xanax 2-3 times a day just to function.  It took 3 months and a positive ANA test to discover that Bupropion can cause a Lupus type reaction in your body.  I quit it cold turkey and my anxiety and vision issues left with.

27,Bupropion,Anxiety,1.0,,"March 7, 2021",77,"Bupropion is not intended for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Unlike sertraline or fluoxetine, bupropion acts on dopamine. Dopamine is not indicated in anxiety disorder. My doctor prescribed this medication off label for anxiety and my experience was very negative. Not only did bupropion not relieve symptoms of anxiety, it also caused severe nervousness and paranoia, high blood pressure, fast beating heart, constipation, difficulty concentrating, increased anxiety, not feeling alert, having trouble speaking, tremors, shaking, headaches, among other unpleasant side effects. Even though there are claims on the internet that bupropion is effective treatment for anxiety, it should never be given to individuals with anxiety. Bupropion is an antidepressant medication that blocks the reuptake of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is not implicated in anxiety disorder such as panic disorder. Bupropion is intended for the treatment of depression, not anxiety.",Angela

I suffer from anxiety and phobias and this is not a calming medication.  It is like an antidepressant on steroids.

I couldn’t sit or stand for more than 15 minutes due to the dizziness and spent half the day lying in bed. I quit taking it that day.

103,Bupropion,Anxiety,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 3, 2016",17,"Kinda late getting in the loop here, but I started on wellbutrin sr 150mg for major depression then was increased to 300mg after finding the 150 was minimally helping. Was having some generalized anxiety but evidently wasn't bad enough during the assessment period while in outpatient treatment to warrant a diagnosis for it. After OP treatment the 300mg was helping some for the depression, but not as much as would like so I was increased to 450mg. Up until that point the anxiety bit was pretty manageable, but after about a week or so on 450mg my anxiety started to skyrocket. I didn't feel much more help on the depression side at 450mg though. However, with the heightened anxiety I went back to 300mg. Talked to my primary doc who seemed to think that the Wellbutrin shouldnt have much effect on anxiety  (despite conflicting evidence to the contrary I've read online on multiple sites) so he put me on celexa 10mg as well recently for the anxiety and notified my therapist as well. Not been on the celexa long enough yet to see how much it helps, but it has made me somewhat queezy as was communicated as a side effect of celexa. So the short of it is my anxiety didn't get real bad until going from 300mg to 450mg of wellbutrin and the depression has only had limited help going from 150mg to 300mg to even 450mg.

I've learned to cope with it as I got older but it seemed to always be one step ahead of me. I talked to my doctor and she put me on Welbutrin XL 150.  As the years went on my anxiety increased due to stress at work, university and life in general. This caused me to develop depression to the point where I cannot watch a commercial without crying because the father said I love you to his daughter.

The boost did not last and I started to get very anxious and somewhat depressed after the first week. I eventually had to start back on the Lexapro. I don't think Bupropion is a very effective anxiety medication and it is not generally prescribed for that purpose.
