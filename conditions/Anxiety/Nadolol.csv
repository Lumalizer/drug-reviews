0,Nadolol,Anxiety,8,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 28, 2014",9,"Prescribed this medicine to prevent migraines, but have anxiety.  I'm answering the other posted question regarding dizziness when getting up and sweating. Yes and yes.   I often feel hot or excessively sweaty and the dizziness comes and goes. Did not know this would help anxiety.",pepitaJones
1,Nadolol,Anxiety,6,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 1, 2013",30,"I was prescribed nadolol for anxiety and thought it wasn't going to work as I have been on Xanax and Klonopin to treat anxiety attacks in the past. I started on 20mg 2x a day and was moved up to 40mg 2x a day. It has helped to an extent, I still have anxiety but they are a lot less frequent then they used to be. I do however have some side effects from this medication that the Dr. dont seem to be too concerned about and I was wondering if anyone else who is taking this medication for anxiety have had them. I get very lightheaded or dizzy if I get up from a lying position and have to wait a few minuets before I get up and sweats. Anyone else have these side effects?",Momof2inAZ
