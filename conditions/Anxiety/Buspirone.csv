1,Buspirone,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 1, 2022",1,"BuSpar (buspirone):This medication has changed my life. I had crippling anxiety, and kept having antidepressants prescribed to me which I refused to take. After a couple weeks on Buspar, my life got exponentially better.

2,Buspirone,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 1, 2022",0,"BuSpar (buspirone):After cycling through (in order) Prozac, Prozac + Celexa, Prozac + Xanax, Prozac + Abilify, Lexapro, Lexapro + Xanax, Lexapro + Klonopin, Effexor + Klonopin, Wellbutrin + Klonopin to treat an anxiety disorder and panic attacks, I found Buspar. I don't know how it works, but it does. It makes me calm, able to think clearly, and feel like myself. It isn't sedating and doesn't cause sleepiness; it's just calming. I still have anxious energy, but it slows my thoughts and allows me to be more present. I'm not sure of its precise mechanism of action, but it worked right away for me.",V_Redmond
3,Buspirone,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2022",0,"BuSpar (buspirone):After years of being treated with an array of new breakthrough drugs for Bipolar 2, which all were miserable with the side-effects. Anti-depressants we’re not working because it leads to more manic-depressive cycles for Bipolar patients. For years, programmed into a Big Pharma drone on Adderall and Xanax to treat my swings in mood/energy, but never feeling any sense of internal happiness or mental growth. Buspar and Carbamazepine were the two drugs that pulled me out of this dark hole. Lithium too had led to physical degeneration and my mood was still not getting better after a year (dry mouth, lazy). I was on Carbamazepine for 3 months and feeling better however I realized I was often still on edge. With Carbamazepine alone I was no longer angry about small things, but I still felt off. Buspar completely provided me the peace of mind I needed to move forward in life and allowed small things to roll off of my back. I felt positive changes on Day 1.",Mr. BPD2

5,Buspirone,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2022",0,BuSpar (buspirone):Went from heart palpitations and rocking in a chair to normal in two doses. I know benzos seem alluring for their fast acting relief but they aren’t worth the much much much worse side effects. I can’t believe it took this long for me to be prescribed this drug. I hope it continues to get better. Time to sleep more than 6 hours again for the first time in months. Saved my life. Sometimes it takes longer. I had some strange thoughts after the first dose you might too but fight through them and it will be worth it. I’m excited for life again. People with CHS should try this when getting off cannabis.,Fast for me
6,Buspirone,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 14, 2022",0,I was diagnosed with agoraphobia. My doctor prescribed me 20 mg of buspirone. It made me sleepy so I took the full dose at night and it held me through the whole next day. I used it for about 5 months. It helped me be able to go out and live a normal life. It works well. 15 years later I still have low level anxiety. I am going to ask my doctor to prescribe some for me but a lower dose.,Kelly
7,Buspirone,Anxiety,1.0,,"March 9, 2022",1,"I've been on this for a month, and let me tell you, its the scariest thing I've ever experience on meds. I feel so out of it like dissociating, hearing things, feeling paranoid, shaky, and I can not concentrate for the life of me. I took some xanax that was prescribed to me and woke up still feeling the same just less panicky. I'm happy it works for others but it did not for me and I hope I can feel normal again. I thought I was going insane and had to go to the ER.",rena
8,Buspirone,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 6, 2022",1,"BuSpar (buspirone):Buspirone saved my life! Several times in the past years. It's a life saver and life changer. I was terrified to start taking it at first due to the horrible reviews I would read, but everyone's different. And I really needed help with my severe anxiety/panic attacks so I started taking it and hoped for the best. It was the best decision I've made. I started taking 7.5mg twice a day and felt the difference the next day,  taking 15mg twice a day when needed to. I had mild side effects for the first week, headaches, tiredness, vivid dreams, but all tolerable. The first 3 days being the worst but went away. Within the first week I felt so much better, and just got better after that. Felt more calm, less anxiety, no overthinking, no more intrusive thoughts, better sleep and its not habit forming which is a plus for me. It really works, I recommend it if you really want to help yourself. Don't be scared of the side affects or reviews and push thru it. It really works. I'm so thankful for it.",Jackie.M
9,Buspirone,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2022",2,"BuSpar (buspirone):I started taking this medication after taking Mirtazapine (increased weight gain but worked well for sleep), Wellbutrin (increased my anxiety immensely), and Xanax. I don’t think anything works quite as well as Xanax for panic attacks (and I still have to take it when I feel them coming on) but Buspar really helped control my GAD. I went from having intrusive thoughts looping inside my head, increased heart rate, changes in body temperature, and feeling constantly on the edge to being able to get through the day without the sense of impending doom. I still have anxiety, but it doesn’t feel like the end of the world anymore and I have been able to get my life back. Some side effects- dizziness after first taking it and brain zaps for the first few weeks, but very little compared to others. I started with 5mg and now take 15mg broken apart through the day. With meditation, exercise, talk therapy, healthier foods and this medication, I finally have my life back.",GAD and Panic
10,Buspirone,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2022",2,BuSpar (buspirone):Horrible! I was stated on 14 mg a day. At first it was okay. I’m like I can work through the side effects. Then bam!!!! I felt weird one night. Like dizzy and like I couldn’t sit up straight. I just wanted to lay in bed but I was at work with a 20 min car ride home!!! So I drank lots of water and I was able to function. On the drive home it was rainy and every puddle I hit I thought it was going to spin off the road. I got home then started worrying about rent so much. I almost cried. It was horrible!!! I have never had such a bad panic attack. It’s the day after and I still feel like I am having it but not as bad. I had to take a hydroxyzine to help bring me down from it.My advice? Don’t get too comfortable with it.,Teetzy81

12,Buspirone,Anxiety,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 22, 2022",2,"BuSpar (buspirone):I could never take more than 10 mg at once without dizziness and nausea that would surprisingly last approx. 30 minutes to an hour. Even 5 mg would sometimes cause dizziness. I was supposed to take 15mg (?) mg twice a day but I would take less than my prescription because of the dizziness. It was really frustrating and I'm not sure if buspar helped my anxiety. Being off of it, I still don't have as many panic attacks and as much anxiety as I used to. I thought that the decrease in panic attacks and anxiety was due to taking the buspar, but now I'm not sure. I was very unhappy with this medicine because the dizziness after taking it always happened even though I was on it and taking it consistently for quite a long time.",jjj

I had terrible dissociative episodes of pure paranoia leading onto aggressive rage for years. I’ve tried SSRI’s since I was 14 and none had worked, and now that I’ve tried buspirone things have changed for me. I handle life and my issues so much better than I used to.

I did not notice any real change in my anxiety levels and the side effects were disturbing. I got brain zaps, plus it aggravated my restless leg syndrome and seemed to prevent me from ever falling asleep all the way. My psych spoke highly of this med so I know it works for a lot of people.

17,Buspirone,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 15, 2022",3,"I know some meds are not for everyone but this medication made me feel INSANE in a way no others have before. It made me feel completely on edge at all times along with restlessness, anxiety, hopelessness, crying spells, fear of outside, light and being alone, disassociation and constant fear. I can't believe a medication can make you feel this way. I just wanted to post my review in case others are going through what I went through that you need to get off the meds and give it time, unfortunately. I truly felt like I was going insane and went to the ER, my PCP and psychiatrist and all of them were surprised that buspirone could cause this but it WAS buspirone. So if you are going through getting off this med just know that you will be OK and that you will not feel this way forever and it just needs to work it's way out of your system.

I get migraines a few times a year but on Buspirone I was getting migraines every single day. My psychiatrist said migraines weren't a side effect and it should actually help with migraines -- it was definitely giving me serious migraines every day.

I am also sensitive to medication and have a drug history my late teens. So the chemicals in my brain are unbalanced and my tolerance for meds aren’t high.

I was put on 60mg when I started having severe panic that would not go away and it lasted for weeks before I decided to start weaning myself off of it and I am still working to get off.

Unfortunately buspirone was just as bad with side effects for me. I took half of the lowest dose for 4 days and I simply couldn't handle the side effects anymore. I even tried going down to 1/4 of a dose, but it was still too intense. I felt completely unhinged, like I was constantly standing on the ledge of a tall building, pure adrenaline, like I had 10 cups of coffee, shaky, super emotional, afraid! It works for some people and that is great! But not for me. Maybe if I could have stuck it out, it would have worked in the long run, but the side effects were simply too much for me.

I've been on pretty much everything and even abused various street drugs before. Of the prescription drugs I've read a lot of seemingly potential addicts give Buspar 1s in reviewing it because it's not Xanax. You're right, it's not, but that doesn't discount it for some of us it works for. I've been on Xanax, and it is stronger, but also has way more side effects including brain fog, sometimes drowsy, and definitely has that pull towards it in an addicting way (I've been addicted to many things). Buspar is okay at treating anxiety and sometimes okay is good and, if I miss a dose of Buspar, I honestly don't think ""OMG, I need my dose!"" It's seemingly no big deal if you do and your body and mind don't seem to crave it as much. Sure, it feels good to feel good as drugs can do for you but sometimes you just want to live and not be a slave to medicine. Because some reviewers were tweaking for Xanax doesn't merit giving Buspar a 1, it works.",Chuck

37,Buspirone,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 2, 2021",1,Yesterday and today I started Buspirone for the first time for anxiety (5mg twice a day). I'm a female and last night and today I was feeling VERY uncharacteristically  aroused. I couldn’t understand why this came on so suddenly. After googling I realized this seems to be common. I know this typically takes a couple weeks to work for anxiety but I definitely think it did the other thing… Only other side effect was a mellowish feeling about 45min after taking the first two doses. The first two I took without food. My 3rd dose I took with food. I can’t say I'm complaining  but as a single girl with impulse control issues I can see this being an issue later on.,MyFirstDose

I started off 5mg 2x a day and increased it to 30mg (15x2). However, the 15mg dose makes me dizzy at times so changed to 15mg at night (before bed) and 10mg a few hours after lunch.  I find the dizziness increases when you take it with food, especially sugary foods (I take it on an empty stomach).  Bottom line: this stuff works really well for GAD. I no longer worry or fear.  It turns off your fear response and lets you live.  If it did not give me the dizziness (which lasts about 1 hour sometimes) it would be 10/10. Not a substitute for Xanax (I still take .5mg at night), but I have been able to lower Xanax use and control anxiety very well.  Buspar is a MUST for those with GAD.  Just start off low (5mg x2) and work your way up. Do not be afraid it! I would think most people with GAD will respond well with 20 to 30 mg a day. Also, for those with tinnitus, it does not affect it.",Rob
39,Buspirone,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 18, 2021",9,"I have mild (sometimes severe) anxiety. I’m a college student and I work in the medical field, so I wanted something that could cure my anxiety but not change me as a person and make me become someone I wasn’t (drowsy, lethargic, inattentive) like I've heard many anxiety medications can make people. I needed something to keep me calm but clear minded. I’m taking 10mg, I am a relatively small female so I was a bit worried it might make me dizzy or tired, instead it truly saved me. My anxiety and worry and over thinking was really taking over my every day life. Now I feel clear minded and calm without feeling like I'm drugged up. It feels genuine. This is the help I needed. Anyone who has rated this drug poorly, it’s because they wanted something harder like alprazolam(xanax), lorazepam, diazepam etc… which sometimes is needed for people going through more traumatic experiences like PTSD. but if you have pretty general anxiety… this will 100% help you.",bella

The racing, unhelpful thoughts are still there, but I’m much more easily able to redirect them or use meditation to pull myself back to the present moment.

So I finally decided I was going to take one! Within 30 to 45 minutes it was like the faucet turned off! It makes me sleepy so I prefer to take as needed but it work!,Thank god!

One day, I was in the guidance counselor's office by third period just sobbing and hyperventilating, and I completely missed fourth period because of it.

For the past couple months I have been dealing with horrible stomach problems and nasty anxiety attacks. When I went to the doctor they suggested I take Zoloft for the anxiety. Zoloft was the first SSRI I tried and the first night I tried it I felt extremely sick. I went to the doctor again and they put me on prozac. I took that the first day and felt okay. The second day I took it I couldn’t even get out of bed. I was super nervous to try anything else (especially SSRI’s). So my doctor prescribed me BusPar. It is not an SSRI and doesn’t have as bad side affects. I’m taking this pill 2x’s a day and I started taking last night and am now on the third dose. I haven’t felt sick at all and I hope it stays that way!! But so far so good!,Theanxietyfreak

I've been on several of the benzodiazepine group before for anxiety (Valium, Xanax, Ativan) and the only advantage to those is that you can take as needed for anxiety and they work quickly. They are also highly addictive. Buspar is not addictive but must be taken regularly--not just for an anxiety attack. It doesn't ""work"" for an immediate attack. But if you take it regularly three times a day you won't have anxiety and you won't need the benzos. I think it is wonderful!",kkheflin3

Luckily I found a doctor who agreed. Unfortunately, he prescribed me buspirone.

While it helped, I was still having days. We bumped it to 20 mg, and it has made a world of difference.

He agreed it was safe to take with my other medications (quite a few that I take for chronic pain and anxiety) but this medication, that is the ONLY FDA approved medication for anxiety that is NOT addictive, or so he says, actually has made me smile and made my general social and overall anxiety go away.

I do have to take it right before bed, I get extremely lightheaded and can feel my pulse throughout my body. Other than that, it does work well. I still use Klonopin when I need to, but it's not often. I'm taking 30mg before bed.",Anonymous
