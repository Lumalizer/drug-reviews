0,Desvenlafaxine,Anxiety,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 17, 2022",0,"I just want to get some hope. I have been dizzy for more than a year. All tests done, no apparent cause. Anxiety, depression, stress is the aiming explanation. Was prescribed this, I am afraid by the negative reviews, I do not want to start this, get hooked and still have this fatigue, dizziness and certain lack of motivation. On top of this sickness my girlfriend kicked me to the curb. I am really hopeless, I think I am physically sick without any way out. I think I am good guy, smart, etc... and I have this thought this drug may change the good I am. I quit fluoxetine 8 months ago. It helped but it made me irritable or at least I was irritable too often while on it. Please, some light to make the decision.",Rick
1,Desvenlafaxine,Anxiety,9.0,,"March 7, 2022",1,I was pretty hesitant to try this medicine because the reviews. But I’ve tried many other antidepressants/anxiety brands before. This one by far is the best one. I take 25mg daily.  My anxiety is little to none on a daily base. No racing thoughts. I can enjoy daily activities where before I was so irritable over everything all the time. I never wake up tired anymore and I can really tell a difference in my energy levels. I will say it made me lose 20 pounds I’m never hungry so that’s the only down fall to this medicine for me.,Anonymous

4,Desvenlafaxine,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 31, 2021",2,I have been taking Pristiq for 1 year now and it is highly effective for my anxiety. First month I had insane insomnia (would sleep for maybe 2 hours a night) and also had zero appetite. Things went back to normal once my body adjusted. Only downside I feel now after a year is that I do not feel major emotion at all. The highs aren’t high and the lows aren’t low - I always feel neutral. Also have a hard time feeling emotion towards other people which can be problematic. It is also very expensive.,SF27

7,Desvenlafaxine,Anxiety,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 20, 2021",0,"Pristiq was prescribed and I gladly took it…only because I was unable to function any longer at that point. I had been on another antidepressant for years with no problems and stupidly thought that ridding myself of chemicals was the way to go. I stopped that antidepressant. But eventually anxiety issues manifested themselves …..so I thought Pristiq, recommended by my GP, would be a slam dunk solution. Right from the first pill I experienced a bitter taste and thought this will go away as my body adjusted. Fast forward to 6 months of living with a constant bitter taste all this time. As far as my anxiety issue the drug was mildly effective. I still was unable to sleep, had tingling sensations to left leg area , hot flashes etc. I was out of the country at this point and miles away from my GP. Everything tasted like I had eaten a bag full of kale. On my return home… my first job was get this drug out of me. After a month of stopping PRISTIQ the bitter taste is worse……",Anxious Lady
8,Desvenlafaxine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 13, 2021",3,"It's an amazing drug indeed. I was suffering from heavy anxiety in the early days of quarantine in 2020 and my doctor told me to start taking desvenlafaxine 50mg with 20mg of Frisium. After 2 months I began taking only 100mg of desvenlafaxine and my life has been much better. Overall, my anxiety is non existent and I don't crazily worry about small things like before. The only negative point which I don't even care is that I sometimes feel a little slow in my thoughts. Not dumb but I take thoughts calmly.This weekend I forgot to buy my meds and I did not take it for 2 days. My life was a nightmare. Headache, dizziness, confused and vivid dreams, stress and anxiety. So, never forget to buy extra quantities whenever you can",Dio

But with deaths of parents and sister in 10 years, I have been hit hard,  10 years ago. People need to understand,  no matter how strong a person you are, this nasty anxiety has no bias! I felt I was letting everyone down I loved, this alone causes you depression, hard to explain. I have an outgoing personality as I work with the public daily, in truth..that is what saved me to make it through another day. Most times I didn't want to go home after work. The house, mess...no one respecting my little requests,  eg. picking up shoes, putting their own back packs out of the hallway, I'd leave notes to - it just made me feel sad and alone.

All I had was bad days! It made me dissociate so bad with myself. I felt like I was watching my life just fly by all I felt was constant worry or sadness. I ended up seeing a psychiatrist and I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I was taken the wrong medication so if you have bipolar disorder I would NOT recommend this medication at all.,Maddi

The first three days I was zonked and did not feel emotions, prior to this I was experiencing nightmares and anxiety attacks from childhood trauma along with vivid memories which would make me feel like I was reliving the event, so starting off zonked was not bad for me. For the past two mornings, no where near as dopey but I have woken and almost instantly have ""anxiety belly"" I can feel the stressful thoughts trying to seep through but they're not as loud as usual.

So my primary dr got me on this medication because I was losing it I felt it. Three weeks now I feel amazing.

15,Desvenlafaxine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 29, 2020",10,Started this drug desvenlafaxine 5 days ago when I had my 2nd ever panic attack and I haven’t been able to sleep since.  At first I thought it was my anxiety keeping me up but it was the side effects of this drug that has only made my anxiety worse . I warn those this seems to be a strong drug and don’t be tempted to get on it after your first anxiety attacks. I plan to get off of it but I am terrified that my body will react to the removal of this drug from my system. I'd rather have an anxiety attack than to feel like a zombie at 4am struggling to sleep. My doctor said I can wean off of it after a year but I have yet to read about someone successfully do so.,Amob23

I'm more confident, and just feel so much better in general.Social anxiety is still there, but I can deal with that in other ways.My libido has dropped, but I just need to make a bit more of an effort to keep things going. My BF totally understands.The downside is if I forget a single dose, I get brain zaps. Very uncomfortable and annoying. Overall I'm very happy with it.",Lily

18,Desvenlafaxine,Anxiety,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 2, 2020",34,"After being on Venlor for a year and a half, the medication suddenly stopped working during my final year of high school, ensuing in a damn difficult year emotionally and mentally. This year May, I decided to try Exsira (generic of Pristiq - cannot get the generic in my country). The first 4 weeks were difficult with difficulty sleeping in the first week, heightened anxiety, and waking up so fatigued and drained throughout the day. Most of the side effects subsided except the fatigue which truly became debilitating - especially during quarantine. So I'm officially stopping this medication soon and trialling another. Reminder - Just because this medication didn't work out for me, does not mean it won't for you. I had such hope that it would work because Venlor did, but everyone is different.

22,Desvenlafaxine,Anxiety,10.0,,"February 18, 2020",45,"This drug has been amazing for me. I have always been a little anxious but no issues. Then I had appendicitis that hospital failed to diagnose despite repeated visits for 8 days. This progressed to peritonitis and sepsis and I was in hospital for 5 weeks, after nearly dying.I went back to work ASAP and then realised I was on the brink of a breakdown. Constant crying and hospital flashbacks and unable to sleep. I went to a new GP desperate for help and he recommended Pristiq.I had the first four days of side effects - bad headache, feeling out of sorts, constipation - but after two weeks I felt better. The anxiety? Turned off like a tap. No more constant running of negative thoughts or traumatic flashbacks. It has been amazing.Only issue I have with it now is some days I feel utterly exhausted but it’s not every day, and the freedom from the anxiety is the best - I am a better partner and better colleague.

I slept for 3 days straight. My doctor put me on lexapro which made me feel annoyed. I went back and asked him for some Valium.  For 2 years I took Valium every couple of days but wanted to get off it as it's not good long term but I couldn't stay awake without it, and my anxiety was really peaking when I didn't have it. I was scared to try anti depressants again but my doctor said pristiq should work so I tried it and fell in love with it. I've been on it for 3 years and it has done wonders for me. I only take a  50mg dose which has really calmed my anxiety down and dulled my flight reflex. My doctor wanted me to start coming off it but I have no interest in doing so until my kids are big.

It suppresses those feelings you have no control over regardless of how hard you try. Some side effects included initial constipation, jittery jaw, feeling a bit dizzy, but all subsided after a few weeks. Dry mouth still persists and if I forget to take it for a day I get the dizzy type feeling, but this goes when I get back on track with it. Side effects are well worth the positives. I have now halved the does to 25 mg (I cut a 50 mg myself as thats the lowest dose) and feel it still helps me. I am slowly working towards reducing the dose, I will see how I go through winter on 25 mg, but I will have no concerns to go back up to 50, and/or even stay on it forever if needed!

I ended up getting out of bed and paced back and forth inside my room, where my mind felt like it was racing at 1000x a second. My body began to shake, my vision decreased slightly, I lost my coordination, felt it very hard to concentrate, and at one point it felt like my legs wanted to give out from underneath me. Most importantly, I had the biggest panic attack I've ever experienced, and was very heavily breathing. I may have been experiencing something known as Serotonin Syndrome, which can induce seizure. Thankfully I had some Clonazepam on hand and took a small dose to calm myself down which helped significantly. I will be indefinitely discontinuing the use of all SSRI and SNRI's in the future, courtesy of the side effects of desvenlafaxine.",Bob

Since it was not in generic form at the time, I opted for choice #2, generic Paxil, for insurance/money reasons. That has worked very well for my anxiety for 3 years, but the one side-effect that has driven me nuts was always feeling sooo tired in the morning. Since the generic for Pristiq has come out, I decided to switch, and I already feel more awake and energetic in the morning. I have tried a plethora of anti-anxiety meds over the years, always with side effects or they just quit working. Knowing that everybody has a different body chemistry and reactions to medication vary greatly, I HIGHLY recommend doing the DNA test if you can. It has been a real life changer for me and the change from generic Paxil to Pristiq has been seamless.",Cekropian

I would break down in doctors offices regularly, and started having panic attacks in the middle of the night and then finally during the day.
