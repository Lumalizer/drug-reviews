0,Trazodone,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 8, 2022",1,"I've been taking trazodone since 2014 50-100mg, and honestly would go as far as to say they saved my life.Started taking for major depressive episode/bipolar 2/anxiety. When I started taking trazodone my anxiety and agitation were unbearable. This medication calmed me down, helped with my mood and sleep.I've had no side effects. I realise everyone is different but I've been on several anti depressants /mood stabiliser etc and would say this medication has helped me the most to be able function and live a decent life.",Poppy
1,Trazodone,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 18, 2022",3,"I have been taking low dose (35-40mg) of Trazodone for over 2 years. It has been a life changer for me. My anxiety levels and concentration issues had not allowed be to function normally. I had serious sleeping issues, too. After a couple of weeks Trazodone solved almost all problems. I still have attention/concentration problems, but I cannot compare them to the ones I faced. My physical symptoms are gone, too. I had OCD and generalized anxiety. Today, with Trazodone, I would say, I function 90%. It is important that whatever you take, you not only address the symptoms, but do meditation or any other form of regular practice (which becomes a habit) to heal. I am curious what happens when - at a point - I wean off... Be well!",Themistokles

So I had to stop til the figure out what to do.   I was using trazodone for anxiety and to sleep.  It says in the side effects increased mucus could happen.  Anyone else experience this?   Thank you!,Country girl
3,Trazodone,Anxiety,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 6, 2021",0,"Unfortunately I had to experience trazodone in my life due to stress and anxiety. Can't fault or praise it.From my 3 months experience, taking 1 dose of 50mg at bedtime,  I can concur the following:A) Helped me sleep 8 hrs straight, without waking up but I also sleep the same after stopping it. It seems it created a sleep pattern for me, which I need it badly. B) It increased my health anxiety due to often palpitations and irregular breathing. C) Started getting dizzy and being restless towards the end of my 3rd month taking it.Decided to stop taking it after completing 3 months.I've lowered the dose to 25mg for 1 week and stopped completely after.Overall experience.....never again on pills for anxiety. Rather dealing with it on my own.",Maya
4,Trazodone,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 19, 2021",1,"Trazadone is horrific. It is not effective at all towards depression and anxiety and in my experience was even questionable in its help towards sleep/insomnia. If anything, it made my depression and low moods a lot worse and my anxiety tripled tenfold, and got out of control. For the three long weeks I was on it I constantly felt spaced out, like I was never really present and was living on a different planet. That in itself is a really horrible side effect. It was no use to me, I've been switched to mirtazapine and the 6 days I've been out it have been far more positive than the weeks I tried to stick out trazadone. for me  it didn't work as an antidepressant and the side effects are too long and unmanageable. You might find it better but my advice would be to steer clear.",Rubbish

I have brain fog, feel awful and my quality of life is near zero. Had numerous  blood tests to rule out any other illness. All came back negative. The sooner I get off this awful drug the better.

Big mistake for 7 months I suffered greatly, nothing helped, my anxiety was a shocker ,so decided to withdraw once again slowly. When I was down to a quarter of a tablet I was rushed into hospital with arterial fibrillation of my heart they suspect it was the trazadone as it can cause tachicardia in some.  I a, happy to say I’m free of it and now on mirtazapine, what a difference.  It is  an amazing tablet I’m very sensitive to all meds but no side effects from this.

If I start worrying now, & get those body feelings, they completely go away once I refocus. I am so grateful that I got prescribed. The appetite suppression was ROUGH. For the first month, or if you take your meds too late before bed, you will have a hard time waking up, headaches, and grogginess after waking. But this will all be worth it! The thought of food was nauseating & I had to live off protein shakes just to go on. But seriously, it helped me lose weight & stop my anxiety, I’m so so so beyond happy with it.",Caitlynn

It doesn’t put me to sleep right away like some people say, but it does prevent me from waking up within the night. Once I’m asleep, I stay asleep which is great. My anxiety has definitely been a lot more manageable, my appetite has improved, and my mood has improved.

14,Trazodone,Anxiety,2.0,,"February 21, 2021",7,"I started Trazodone at the suggestion of my doctor who said it was non addictive and it may help to wean me off of Ativan, which I started taking for depression following mom's death.    I ended up taking two Trazodone (100 mg) nightly.   In four months approximately I detoxed off the Ativan.  I waited a month and started weaning off the Trazodone by dropping a quarter pill, to 1.75 pills per night.  This was tough but I persisted and in a couple of more weeks I dropped down to 1.5 pills per night.  At this point I had extreme reaction where it felt like my head was in a vice and I was in panic mode.  So I went back to 1.75 pills for another month and my head came out of the vice, then I dropped back to 1.5 pills.  My head was in a vice again but I persisted and in a week I started feeling better.  I am currently taking 0.75 Trazodone one night and 0.5 the next.  I will move all the way to zero pills this way.  Way too long of a detox for me.   Never again....I hope.",Mac

17,Trazodone,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 18, 2021",12,"At the beginning I was scared to use this drug as many people with anxiety are when they start new medications. I started with trazodone 12 mg with lorazepam and then 25 mg with lorazepam, then finally 50 mg without lorazepam. The 50 mg really helped with my sleep! I can finally fall asleep and stay asleep. You really need to give this medication time to work. It took about 1-2 weeks for it to work for me. At 50 mg it doesn’t help much with my anxiety but for sleep and appetite it’s been amazing.

21,Trazodone,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 22, 2020",31,"I have mixed feeling about trazadone.  It helped me a lot, and at that time it was a life saver for me. My insomnia, anxiety, depression just disappeared completely. Before that I had suicidal thoughts, I couldn't get out of the bed, I had social anxiety, panic attacks, but after trazadone I was already a functioning, happy human being. I started to go out with my friends again, I had motivation etc. So far so good BUT it had too many side effects... I needed to sleep like 10-11 hours, I was numb for hours after awakeing, I felt constant dizziness, my sex drive disappeared. And the withdrawal was tough... I had to reduce the amount very slowly. So basically nothing seriously bad, and it is still a decent antidepressant, but there are better SSRIs out there. It will sure help your depression/anxiety, but you will have to pay the price for that (that is true for every medicine btw)",Greg

34,Trazodone,Anxiety,10.0,,"October 7, 2019",81,"13 years ago, I was prescribed 100 mg at bedtime for insomnia and anxiety. Upon Awakening, I couldn't think straight. It was awful. So I discontinued it. A couple of weeks ago, I decided to request that my doctor prescribed trazodone again a 25 mg per night. I am a long time user of benzodiazepines. Doctors are reluctant to prescribe benzos. Quite frankly, I'm tired of the battle to get them. Not only that. My favorite is Xanax. Xanax is a brain cell Destroyer. I would like to keep what's left of my mind. The trazodone 25 mg at bedtime allows me to sleep through the night without anxiety and flashbacks . No lying awake tossing and turning reliving undesirable events in my history. My insomnia has been a lifelong condition. I have mostly self-medicated through the years.

49,Trazodone,Anxiety,8.0,,"May 13, 2018",45,"I started taking 50 mg at night for sleep. I was told that for anxiety/ depression, the therapeutic dose is much higher. I disagree- I have noticed a difference, not just in my sleep, but in the way I think about things- more logically. Last night, I started to have extreme anxiety/ paranoia. I decided to take my dose early so I would  be knocked out, ending the thoughts. It didn't knock me out- maybe it was too early to take it, or maybe I was too anxious. But it did help me calm down, think rationally, and I was able to focus more. I think it's great, If I'm tired and can't sleep, it knocks me out. If I don't need sleep and I'm getting anxiety, it calms me down and helps me think clearly- not like I'm high from from a benzo. I think this is a good med to try in different situations and see what / how/ when it works. Only bad thing: I skipped it one night, thinking because I had to be up earlier, I would be tired the next day. I had like a rebound effect- I was up  ALL night..",Krissy

I have PTSD, trouble falling/staying asleep, and anxiety/panic during the day. I take between 12.5mg and 25mg of trazodone at night. It’s like a miracle drug for me. The side effects I’ve had are feeling a little zoned out (this has worn off over the past 3 weeks), less nervous eating, and occasional increased REM sleep.

The other anti-depressants only caused my mania to explode and make me stop taking them.  Trust me, I've been on a lot of meds. I used to not sleep (maybe 3 hours a night if that) and now I'm sleeping 6-8 on 50 mg of trazodone.  I'm not as mad anymore, I can focus, life is just so much better! I would have rated it a 10, but it gives me heartburn and it is a little more sedating in the morning when I'm trying to wake up (can't have caffeine). This medicine is truly a God send! But, for anyone that has bi-polar this is definitely an add on to your normal meds.  Taking Klonopin, Depakote, and now Trazodone.  Life is great!",lilly13

This medicine helps me a lot for anxiety and insomnia but not too much for the mild depression. I think thanks to trazodone I got girlfriend because I felt relaxed more confident of myself and ideas come easily. I don’t have important side effect just mild ones like getting some nights hard painful erections that makes me worry to get a priamism but finally it doesn’t happen. Sometimes I feel a little sleepy and I experienced a little down in my libido but I am not sure this last one is caused by trazodone, anyway the benefits are over these mild side effects.",Anonymous

I take 50mg at night and finally my constant ""on the go"" mind is quieted so I can relax and sleep. Have had no serious or disturbing side effects and I've take it for two months. I also take Ativan 1mg (for four years) 4 x's a day as needed. Since my second month started on Trazodone I don't have as much anxiety and can actually take an Ativan "" as needed"" when as before I was popping them like tic-tacs to get through my anxiety filled days and nights. But, as we all know, we are all different. Sidenote: I can't take SSRIs, they make feel worse. Don't know why.",Anonymous
113,Trazodone,Anxiety,8.0,,"October 17, 2011",86,"My doctor prescribed Trazodone for insomnia recently and it has helped better than any of the previous medicines prescribed. Elavil was 1st, but I still woke up throughout the night and in the morning had that groggy feeling in my head that was hard to shake. The Trazodone is working best if I take half before bed and when I wake in the middle of the night, I take the other half of a 50 mg tablet. I was taking Ambien and it made me sleepy enough to doze off, but I would wake up every 2 hours and had trouble falling back to sleep. So far, Trazodone is the best for me for insomnia. I still wake up after a few hours, but can go back to sleep after taking the other half. Hope this helps someone! I know how bad insomnia is!",Sleepless in the South

119,Trazodone,Anxiety,9.0,,"February 15, 2011",74,"Trazodone works great for me. I was put on a Prozac for anxiety/depression issues, and Trazodone also for my anxiety related sleep issues. I've been using it for about 8 months now. I take 50mg every night, and I sleep great through the night and feel great the next day. Sometimes if I've had too much caffeine during the day or have something really important happening the next day I'll take a whole pill (100mg.) The 100mg does make me a little drowsy but it usually wears off by mid morning. When I first started taking it I did get dry mouth and had some stomach problems (which could have been caused by the Prozac) but those went away after the first month. It has really helped my anxiety levels and ensures I get a good nights sleep.",mjchexum

I knew they weren't real, but the memory in the dream had been real so I was entirely overwhelmed every night with anxiety about going to sleep. I would take 50mg of trazodone every night and within 20 minutes no anxiety and within another 10 min I was dozing off. The only thing was I did have harder time waking in the morning mild hangover, but nothing a spot of coffee and shower did not remedy.

It definitely helps with the irritability I was experiencing.  I sleep well if I take half of a 50mg pill.  Unfortunately, when I take a whole pill, I have trouble sleeping.  Despite not sleeping well, I usually have more energy and I am more productive the next day when I take a higher dose.  I also noticed that when I'm taking this medication I sometimes have a hard time speaking, words come out jumbled!  Overall, this medicine has the least amount of side effects of all the medications I've taken for anxiety (no appetite gain, no sexual side effects, no headaches or mood swings).",Anonymous
