0,5-HTP,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 3, 2022",0,"After the loss of some family members, a sudden realization of past trauma and a prolonged period of stress at work I started having panic attacks and rising anxiety which I couldn’t explain being a really logical person. With the onset of the pandemic and the surrounding stress and negativity it resulted in more frequent spells of anxiety and worry.5HTP really helps me lift myself off the bottom step of extremely low periods and moments of rising panic & anxiety and helps me get more restorative sleep to enable recovery.I take 100mg at night and 50mg in the morning for a week after a troubling episode and reduce down to 50 / 50 and then 50 etc and reuse if needed.It’s an absolute savior - no side effects and no embarrassment of continuous calls to the Dr who takes days to get back in touch and only offers SSRI’s.",Anxious Muddle

2,5-HTP,Anxiety,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 11, 2022",3,"BE CAREFUL! I took 5-htp without any advice from the doctor and it kick started my panic attacks journey. Of course I had some trauma deeply rooted in my subconscious, that was the primary reason of my panic attacks, but 5-htp unleashed all of it! I ended up having to go to a psychiatrist and went on SSRIs to fix myself. The doctor told me the dosage advised on the 5-htp box (100-200mg/day) was way to high for me and that messed up my brain. Just don’t take this without a doctor’s advice, please, it might do more harm!",regina
3,5-HTP,Anxiety,1.0,,"January 31, 2022",3,"This stuff is seriously dangerous!! I do a lot of research before I try new things as my body is very sensitive to all supplements, drugs, vitamins etc. I bought the Jamieson brand which indicates the daily dose is 300mg a day, I started with 25mg a day and was only on it for a week until I had to stop taking it. My whole body is now in severe pain (muscles, joints), I get winded just from walking and can’t catch my breath. This is serious, it does cause Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome (EMS) and I’m 99% positive that I now have that. Be careful with this!! And people with an autoimmune disorder or asthma should definitely stay away from it.",Don't take this

BAD MOVE.  Took it before I went to bed on full stomach … felt like I was hungover the next day and my limbs became numb and tingly.  I am 36 hours past taking one pill of slow release 200 mg and I’m still feeling the effects.  DON’T take it.  Not worth it.Just gonna eat well, sleep well, and put into practice better my therapy.

I started a supplement with 5Htp in it. Took it for 2 days and had a massive dizzy spell so I stopped taking it thinking it was the supplement. Started a week later and it’s been four days and I honestly feel my symptoms are much worse than before.

7,5-HTP,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 4, 2021",4,"When you first take 5htp you should start out slow, 50 mg a day a few hours before sleep. Make sure you use a reputable brand and make sure it is enteric coated and have with vitamin b6 and C so it can convert to serotonin. The enteric coating will help prevent the 5htp from converting to serotonin in the stomach, which can cause stomach upset. Up the dosage slowly until you start noticing a benefit. (Effective dosages are between 50 to 300 mgs a day.) As with any supplement or medication give it time. Give the product at least 6 - 8 weeks to notice a benefit.  Always talk to a medical professional before taking any new supplement or medication. And never take the product with and MAOI or SSRI. You could develop serotonin syndrome. Read the article below to educate yourself on 5htp and the current research.",John
8,5-HTP,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 16, 2021",71,"Be very mindful it's all about the dosage & type.. Always Always start with lowest dosage this is a very strong drug not to be messed about with.. 25-50mg is all that is needed to start with & use slow release to avoid bad side effects.I started this for PTSD, ADHD, depression, insomnia mood swings. I use 50mg slow release as soon as I open my eyes & if need be during stressful times another 50mg after lunch.. At 1st I did take the recommended dosages which in my experience are dangerous!!!. Horrendous side effects. Trial, error & masses of research was the key in the end. I have now been taking 5-HPT for 13yrs on & off due to PTSD & Undiagnosed ADHD Which was causing me all sorts of issues from Depression..Anxiety..Insomnia..Terrible Mood Swings..Migraines the list goes on..

I can tell you this works better than any other SSRI or SNRI that I have tried. The only side effect that I get is sometimes weird dreams. But the next morning after I take my dose I feel so good and I don't have much anxiety through out the day and I'm a lot happier as if the black cloud has been lifted. I struggle with anxiety and PTSD. For me this herb works better than prescription drugs and I'm thankful that Ive tried it!,Shan
13,5-HTP,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 13, 2020",17,I have been taking 100mg 5-htp at night and it works really well for me (I have PTSD/anxiety). I've tried prescription SSRI like Prozac and that didn't work. This herb works for me way better. I'm calming through out the day and I feel way less nervous and I no longer have a dark cloud over me. I'm so happy I decided to give this a try. Some side effects I do get especially in the beginning is kind of weird dreams and sometimes seems to raise my anxiety by the 3rd hour but then goes away. I have barely any anxiety the morning I wake up and lasting all day till night time I take my medication. This seems to be a life saver for me. I will continue to use it and see how I do!,Sandraward

With menopause just around the corner there are days my anxiety is off the charts. About 6 months ago I started taking 100mg daily. I was also having moderate to severe panic, heart palpitations, sweating, and severe vomiting. I didn’t make the connection to 5HTP until I recently started taking it again. This time only 25mg. Same symptoms but milder. I cannot be 100% sure but I’m making the connection to this supplement. If you’re thinking of taking thus supplement I highly recommend talking to a holistic health practitioner first. Not to be dramatic but my episodes landed me in the ED three times last year.

I felt the physical symptoms I was anxious but I didn't fear the sensation. I that even makes sense. I was in tears because I haven't felt not not being scared in 3 years. My 2nd day was horrible... terrible anxiety symptoms, constant palpitations, panic attack and a meltdown. Today is my 3rd day I felt so off today...anxious, irritable, like nothing satisfied me (I'm usually a happy, upbeat person despite the anxiety) I was thinking about not taking it anymore because it feels like I'm getting more negatives than positives but I read a few comments about taking a lower dose.

Although I do still have anxiety in public places I have always had this and it isn't as bad. I feel like everyone has anxiety in public, it's encoded in our DNA as a safety mechanism. I will say though that after going off 5htp because I ran out for about a week my mood swings and depression came back quickly and seemed worse then they were before. The change felt drastic and that kind of scared me a bit. Otherwise Id give it a 10.",Lulu

I have a couple different blends with the 5HTP, B6, L Theanine and one for night with melatonin they are both 50 mg and I usually only take 1/2. It tends to make me calm and tired so I prefer night dose but that night dose seems to keep me calm and in a much better mood all of the next day. I have had no side effects other than needing a nap after taking 100mg. It starts working quickly like 1/2 hour. I do find that after 2-3 weeks it tends to quit working so I take a week off then start again.   I definitely recommend trying it.

I tried everything possible, like EMDR, CBT, antidepressants (quite a few with no success as the anxiety was worse on medication than off).I came across this supplement  5-HTP a few days ago and it has changed my life radically! My anxiety was gone the same day I started taking it. Such a huge difference in outlook and interacting with people! I used to have SAD/GAD. Since I have been on this, nothing matters anymore. I do not think about the things I used to think about (e.g. getting anxiety for no reason, or being worried about how others perceive my accent). I do not care.

33,5-HTP,Anxiety,7.0,,"November 15, 2019",73,"Wanted to share my experience with 5-HTP in case it helped anyone. I've used 50mg once daily for the past few years to help with depression/anxiety/sleep issues and it did help for a while, especially with sleeping better. Unfortunately, I now have to stop after realizing it has been making symptoms worse after taking it probably too long. Too much serotonin in your system will cause worse anxiety, so just know that just because this product is sold in the health food section - I would definitely consider it a natural drug you should do your research on. If the dose is too high it will cause worse anxiety issues. This drug can also interact with other medications and alcohol, so just be aware. Buy a brand with good reviews and figure out what time of day taking it works best for you. It made me a bit too relaxed to take it in the morning, but taking it right before bed caused crazy dreams  - so taking it with dinner at least a few hours before bed worked best for me personally.",A

Doctor then suggested 5 HTP a week later. No more attacks (other than the one night I forgot to take the pill) after I started taking 100mg before bed.

I was skeptical but decided that it was worth the 20 bucks to see if it would help alleviate my anxiety issues. I was teaching a class that night and took one of the 5 HTP pills (50 mg) and kind of forgot about it. Several hours had passed and I was on my way home from said class and realized I felt pretty good and relaxed and then remembered the pill I had taken. I was still skeptical however and decided to try another one the next day and I got the same feeling. It's not a tired or groggy feeling, it's actual relief from anxiety and it really works. The only drawback is it can cause your stomach to churn a bit when you first start taking them so make sure you take them with food.",TKahler

I was post concussion and being treated for autoimmune disease. At around 6 months I increasingly noticed I was waking at night, I started getting more anxious, suicidal thoughts . During this time I also did a small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) treatment  of antibiotics which probably helped my gut work better and then started low dose naltrexone for my autoimmune disease. I started to have heart palpitations, sweating at night,  depressed thoughts, panic attacks which I never had before, where you get arrhythmia, continuous bad thoughts, tingling in your fingers and feel dizzy.  When withdrawing from 5 HTP I had horrible time. I had to withdraw slowly as I had a lot of the symptoms of SSRI withdrawal. My brain, and thoughts were so disturbing. I would be very cautious using this drug long term, and continuously. Study needs to be done on low dose naltrexone and 5  HTP. Or post-concussion and 5HTP.",Sad
47,5-HTP,Anxiety,10.0,,"March 13, 2019",91,I have been suffering with anxiety & depression for 16 years. 10 years ago I took Zoloft &  had therapy for a few years but have been on my own with it for 6 years.Recently it was getting hard to deal with again. I tried some herbal routes and St. John’s wort & ashwagandha make me manic.  A few months ago  someone suggested  5-htp which  I  eventually went out & got some.  Game changer. I’m small (4’10 95lbs) so I take 50mg every other day- or every three days. If I’m still experiencing a mildly uplifting mood or lack of intrusive thoughts I just keep going without taking another pill. It’s been super helpful & I never thought I’d be able to live like this.

With SSRI you felt like I was just going with the motions like being on auto pilot with no real get up and go. I switched to 5HTP at 50mg for a few weeks and noticed a difference, no side effects, eating healthy, getting up early, getting out and about and just feeling better about myself, mistakes that I used to think about are now in the past. Only negative I noticed was that the effects seem to differ from different brands of 5HTP.

Just today I bought a new bottle. I'm pretty sure it'll help me again. I can't compare to big pharma meds because I never took them. I take this combined with Omega-3.

And I said once again: DONT MIX THIS WITH BENZOS and be careful if your nervous system is sensitive, you are sensitive to supplements or you suffer from bad insomnia cause it can cause paradoxical reaction. Start with tiny doses to find out, whether this is the right supplement to you. For me it definately is NOT.This supplement also has many side effects",Dizzie-
95,5-HTP,Anxiety,10.0,,"January 18, 2016",203,"I am taking 5-htp (100MG) combined with a complex  B vitamin (100MG) and Sam-e 200MG everyday.. IT WORKS..I am taking these three to treat depression and anxiety. I did not want to be on an anti depressant. My mood is lighter, I feel happier and I feel OKAY. I feel into a deep depression and felt very hopeless and these, along with counselling, are helping me through it. I am blown away by the effectiveness of these three supplements together. I highly recommend them.  I can sleep just fine and I don't feel like there is a rain cloud over my head anymore. I've been waiting to see the sun shine through my heart (sounds cheese lol) but it's true! AND I FEEL IT! I hope you can too.",autiem001
96,5-HTP,Anxiety,8.0,,"January 5, 2016",53,Been using timed release 200mgs for last month and used to 400mgs daily. Slight stomach and headache issues but gone after first week. Works very well but need to buy a quality product. I paired this with Niacinamide 1500-2000mgs this is all medicinal level and it's working nicely with slight mood swings. My sleep is better with higher dose and I'm not suffering major panic attacks. I'm off Seroquel for now and this is working for my seasonal depression and I am bipolar 1. I would recommend a neuropath when using this but I'm very well trained and aware of my body,Onehotbike
97,5-HTP,Anxiety,10.0,,"December 3, 2015",115,Almost immediately effective. Clarity and calmness of mind restored and feeling 100% better. I can not believe it has worked so well.,Kellos
98,5-HTP,Anxiety,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 18, 2015",74,"Don't start off with to high dosage , it affected my sleep . Went from 150mg back to 20mg and slowly increased . Two weeks of stomach upset but it went away . I have noticed I am calmer however my body seems to get use to the dosage quickly and I need to increase it . I am up to 180 mg now and again need to up the dosage . It's really worth giving this product a try before you turn to pharmaceutical medication .",Gezabell
99,5-HTP,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 28, 2015",88,"Just want to add this has been great. I was on citalopram but became too much of a problem for me having to go to the doctors every month and having work. Getting this delivered to my door was so much easier. Been taking 100mg every night before bed, its reduced my anxiety quite a bit. I'm still on a benzo for the time being but what people here have to understand this drug works with chemicals in you brain. This is the reason you get increased anxiety. When I started citalopram my anxiety went through the roof before improving my condition after about 8 weeks. Let it ride through and take it at night at first, it will increase your anxiety  at first and may increase your depression in some people at first but afterwards it works wonders.",zeden
100,5-HTP,Anxiety,10.0,,"August 1, 2015",104,5- HTP has really  helped  me after being unable to tolerate side effects from Zoloft. I tapered off Zoloft and once I stopped I switched directly to 50 mg of 5-HTP in morning and 50 at night. I have had little to no side effects switching to the supplement. Very thankful to find 5 htp,Hillccs
101,5-HTP,Anxiety,8.0,,"June 21, 2015",102,Supplements vary wildly in potency and quality from brand to brand. The way this stuff works for me is to put 50 mg of powder into a quart of water and drink it throughout the day. You do not want to get a huge spike of this stuff into your blood stream that later shoots down. I have great results for several months this way.,Hugh Johnson
102,5-HTP,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 2, 2015",52,"I tried 5HTP to alleviate low mood.It gave me the most horrendous headache from day one.I cannot continue it due to this severe side effect.",New baby
103,5-HTP,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 1, 2015",82,I'm taking 5-HTP with quite a few other supplements (all prescribed by a naturopathic doctor) so it's hard to say what is doing what but I added the 5-HTP after a week on the other supplements and it seemed to make a noticeable difference in my feeling of calm.  I have been on every pharmaceutical AD out there plus benzodiazepines and I will tell you 5-HTP is different in a good way.  If you have reached the end of the line with pharmaceuticals like I did it's worth giving supplements a try but I would recommend approaching it with a naturopathic doctor.,Snoopy2010
104,5-HTP,Anxiety,8.0,,"May 14, 2015",82,"This supplement has really worked for me! The only problem is after about a month of taking it I have started experiencing ringing in my ears and pressure headaches. But, it does boost my mood and I haven't mood swings or anxiety like before I started taking this. Also, I find I haven't been as hungry and eating as much. This supplement would be perfect if I hadn't started having the problems with my ears and the headaches.",anonymous123456780655435435765

After the first dose I slept well and felt really good the next morning; I thought that, at long last, I had found an answer to my prayers.After the second dose my symptoms came back and were magnified many times.

I took another one the next morning and I felt really weird and worsened my symptoms. I took another one the same night and ended up with serotonin syndrome.  Be careful whilst taking this. Make sure you space out your intake as it's terrifying if it goes wrong. I didn't have to go to a hospital, however I had mood changes every 5 mins, heavy brain fog, heavy depression and suicidal thoughts. Took me around a week to clear up again. I'm scared to take another one fearing the outcome.",David.Barr

111,5-HTP,Anxiety,9.0,,"November 29, 2013",208,"I have always suffered from mild mood disorder, general anxiety, stress-induced panic attacks, mixed with ups and downs.  My chiropractor mentioned L-5-HTP, so I gave it a try.  Within 48 hours, I was feeling a night & day difference.  Since I discovered this supplement, I take it in a cycle of a few months on and then a month off.  I find that my body builds a tolerance after awhile, and I will stop and restart again with no side effects in the meantime.  After taking L-5-HTP, I feel happy, calm, and my life is in perspective.  Make sure you purchase the L-5-HTP, not just cheap HTP.  The L-tryptophan is the active ingredient on a molecular level, with vitamin C to help your body absorb the supplement.",Kate M.

But, on a whim, I gave 5-HTP a shot.  And... just wow. WOW.No placebo, no question, no nonsense. 5-HTP has a very strong, STRONG positive effect on me.My mind feels cushioned and clear, my anxieties fade away, and I feel just... collected, calm, comfortable, positive, eager to laugh.  It's like night and day off and on. And again, 5-HTP hits hard and immediately, but with no side effects aside from mild gastrointestinal distress.",Revelation in a bottle.
