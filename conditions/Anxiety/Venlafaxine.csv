0,Venlafaxine,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 30, 2022",0,"I’m 32 yr old male & been taking Effexor with Abilify roughly 3.5 years.  They changed my life, God sends!  I take both is because they compliment each other well for anxiety/depression.  The dose I take is 300 mg Effoxor & 5 mg Abilify.  No side effects for either accept for ONE!  AND it’s the weirdest thing!  It doesn’t happen all the time, I’d say about once a month/maybe twice every 4-6 weeks.  What happens is I get like these visual trips so to speak.  It’s really hard to explain but it’s almost like heightened super vision where I can see every crack, crevice & dirt spot on the walls & ground.  It’s almost like you see too good that you can’t focus on anything going on.  Like you’re so focused on the details of everything.  I know one of the side effects is blurred but this is not so much that as it’s more of a trip of some kind.  Last a few hours usually at night.  Please tell me someone else has experienced this?  My doc has no answers!  Help!",Anonymous
1,Venlafaxine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 21, 2022",0,"Terrible medication. I hear that it is supposed to take a few weeks for the drug just settle in and take full affect, but it is not worth it for me. Within a few days I was unable to get myself to urinate. I ended up in the emergency room because I had felt anxiety unlike anything I had previously felt in my life. This drug made me feel dissociated and vapid. The scariest side effect by far was the mental blockage it creates for urination. Imagine shy bladder syndrome you experience at a public urinal except you feel that every single toilet, even your own at home when you are alone. I am very angry and disappointed.",Artie
2,Venlafaxine,Anxiety,9.0,,"February 23, 2022",3,Effexor XR (venlafaxine):The first couple days I felt weird. The very first dose made my hands and feet sweat for less than 10 mins. I was a little worried because how I felt in the beginning. I've tried various anxiety and depression meds in the past. My doctor said this is stronger. I have always been a little anxious and have suffered a few panic attacks in my lifetime. (I'm 41 yrs) I'm now on my 4th week and feel amazing. I'm more active and enjoy things again. I used to dread leaving my house even just to run an errand. Now I am out and about. I didn't realize how much I really needed this medication. I take it in the morning with breakfast 150 mg. I even sleep better at night. I used to constantly wake up in the middle of the night.,Marie
3,Venlafaxine,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 15, 2022",0,"Effexor XR (venlafaxine):My Doctor out me on Cipralex and for anxiety, depression and panic attacks and for  months it did nothing but kept hearing it take 6 to 8 weeks. Well those weeks passed and nothing changed until my doctor told me to try Effexor within a week I noticed myself feeling better. Now the only problem I had is in the 1percentile super lucky me, my periods stopped. We are trying to have a baby and if we were done that stage in our lives I'd say I'm all for not having a period but we aren't. So after months of feeling better I slowly weened myself off of it. I was on a low dose so it wasn't that hard but 2 weeks later I got my period back.",Anonymous
4,Venlafaxine,Anxiety,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 7, 2022",0,"As with the various other anti-Depressive’s I have tried, venlafaxine worked great for a few months (37.5mg)….gradually, I began to feel anxiety return, disconnected, depression deepened to the point that I could hardly function. I weaned myself off over a week, now 5 days in to being off and feeling mild to moderate typical withdrawal symptoms. No brain zaps but dizziness, spacey, and very weird dreams. I was hesitant to try anti-D’s again. Gave it a last shot…. I’m done. Never again. Thankful that I was on low dose and am not going thru the level of nightmares others are experiencing in their withdrawals. I will work hard to find positive healthy ways to manage my depression/anx as best as I can.",Kcy
5,Venlafaxine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 5, 2022",2,Effexor XR (venlafaxine):After reading so many mixed reviews I want to share my experience because if I would have listened to the reviews on here I would’ve stopped taking the medication. I was put on this medication for anxiety and panic attacks and mild depression the side effects I had were awful. I felt anxious my panic attacks were completely heightened and didn’t start getting used to the medication for the full six weeks. They say that it takes about 4 to 6 weeks for your body to get used to the medication because if you think about it it’s basically reprogramming your brain. I experienced feelings of almost being on speed like my body couldn’t calm down my skin felt weird. I was lucky enough to have an aunt that also took it and she experienced the same things but said that all the side effects are worth it and one day you just wake up and feel normal which is exactly what happened to me .,Cindythompson1
6,Venlafaxine,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 2, 2022",2,"Have had anxiety since a kid. 40 years later decided to try medication as my job was becoming impossible due to my anxiety. (75mg)1st week felt bloated and a bit nauseous. By week 2 I could notice changes in my mood, my body reaction to what would be a trigger for my anxiety. I still experience stress, but it’s a fleeting acknowledgement, and I no longer experience the sweats, nausea, headaches and feeling dizzy. I can think more clearly, make more logical decisions and I am not snappy at people as my overall mood is better. I’ve weighed myself everyday and no weight changes. I’m female and my sex drive has decreased somewhat and I get weird dreams/nightmares which are known side effects. When I wake in the morning I can feel anxious as the medication has worn off, so I do feel the medication is helping fast once taken. For myself the pro’s outweigh the con’s for now and I’ll continue with the medication if my doctor is happy with my progress next week.",Daisy
7,Venlafaxine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 30, 2021",1,"This medication has ruined my life. It has caused numbness and tingling in my feet and hands, so bad it wakes me in the night. I suspect my whole body has some numbness as a result.",Daisy
8,Venlafaxine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2021",2,"Effexor XR (venlafaxine):I guess I'm one of the unlucky ones and had what I would consider a pretty bad reaction to this medication. I only took two doses, but I didn't want to know how much worse it would get. First day was okay, no nausea but I felt moments of depersonalization. The second day I felt more of the depersonalization and at night I woke up with racing thoughts and hot flashes - my entire body felt like it was tingly and hot and my heart was racing and I was sweating profusely. This episode lasted for a good 10-15 minutes. Once I calmed down I got chills and tried going back to sleep. I was woken up 2 more times with the same feeling..I decided to discontinue this med because if it's going to make my anxiety worse, even just for the first few weeks it isn't worth it to me.",Cinthe6ix
9,Venlafaxine,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 26, 2021",0,"This medication does what if says on the tin - it toned down my anxiety I would advise anyone trying this to start on a low dose and see how you feel. After I had my first 37.5mg dose I nearly took off like a rocket (I'm not sure this is supposed so happen but it did with me). I instantly vomited after the first hour. I thought 'wow this must be a very powerful medication' - and it is!. So be careful and consider that you don't know how you will react to it. Ultimately I stuck with it and although it increased my anxiety in the first month eventually it started to get to work. I was able to get on with my job and deal with what was in front of me rather than worrying about 'what if'. I'm tapering off it after 6 months, since it interfered too much with my sleep and never properly felt like 'myself', but its nice to know there is a medication that really works for my anxiety if I ever need it again. If I've got any advice - stick with it!",ben89
10,Venlafaxine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 24, 2021",1,"Effexor XR (venlafaxine):i have now been on effexor XR since the beginning of summer. At first  2 months it seemed to calm my anxiety and I didn't panic as much but that quickly subsided as quick as it started, so I went up a dose (from 37.5-75 to 112.5mg) and it had not changed anything. About 5 or months in I started noticing spikes in my panic attacks, anxiety, and depression, the depression being the worst. I also got prescribed adderall which I take ""as needed' also helps with everything. The effexor now I can't tell if it does anythin, as my anxiety and depression came back full force.  Like it didn't do anything to begin with now or at least barely. Also I do see many things about withdraws. Yeah its said you get them but at least for me it is super bearable like not smoking for a day. That being said it to me seems as useless sugar. I'm really hoping to soon find something that actually does something, these kind of drugs are sugar pills to me or increases depression and anxiety and irrational thoughts.",anon

12,Venlafaxine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 9, 2021",1,"Effexor XR (venlafaxine):I've been on Klonopin for 27 years and I tried all sorts of antidepressants along with it. About two years ago I started Adderall and soon discovered that it worked like any other antidepressant for me. It totally wiped away my social anxieties; however, in May my doctor also thought it was a good idea to get off of Klonopin which wasn't great news for me. The Adderall alone wasn't enough and he put me on BuSpar but ended up in the hospital. The staff refused to listen to me because they don't believe in benzos and controlled substances. I was put on Effexor and realized it wasn't for me, but the doctors kept pumping me full of beta-blockers to reduce my anxiety and had me on Klonopin for several days then released me without a script for Klonopin. Now I'm struggling to find myself in midst of all the chaos. I was stuck with Effexor and beta-blockers and told to follow up with my psychiatrist. I wish everyone here doesn't go through the same ordeal as me. Benzos are not worth it.",john333

I started having panic attacks summer of 2020 and was diagnosed with anxiety depression instead of severe recurrent depression. I tried several more medications and none helped with anxiety. I have been on Effexor 37.5 for a little over 3 months. My side effects are weight gain (about 10-15 lbs, flat mood, sexual dysfunction, and I still have anxiety daily. My doctor recommended coming off by taking one every other day for two weeks, then stopping. There are a lot of positive reviews, but this doesn't work for everyone. Definitely try it for several months before giving up. For me, I just don't feel that it works for my anxiety. I also have premenopausal symptoms, so it's probably a combination of issues at work. I would also recommend working with a psychiatrist instead of family doctor because severe anxiety and depression calls for an expert. It is definitely the hardest antidepressant I've found to come off of.",ACB

If it doesn’t feel right speak to your doctor. I would hate for anyone to suffer as much as I did because the doctor kept saying it’s meant to get worst before it gets better.

The only side effect that bothered me was the brain zaps that occurred if I didn’t take the med at the same time each day.

I didn’t know this was related to the drug so I continued to take it for another year and it got worse.

The stress response also subsides much quicker. I feel like I can function now. I’ve been on this for 4 months and my life has only continued to improve. Only side effect however, is that alcohol impacts me a lot more… I black out pretty easily and need to be so careful now. If I drink too much I act really out of character too, and can be a lot to handle. It’s worth it though, just need to learn better drinking habits and be very mindful.",Jjjjmine

Dr also took it and said to give Effexor XR a go. 3 weeks later I believe he may be right. I no longer am focusing on every little beat my heart makes. I can drive again. I can go places. I'm not perfect yet but major improvements have happened. Fogginess is still there a tad bit but not nearly as horrible as it was 3 weeks ago. It's not even fully in my system yet. If you have taken all the SSRIs there are with no results, try this. It works. I've heard withdrawals are real bad but I'm not worried about that right now. It just feels good to feel a bit more normal again. Praise God.P.S. I'm still able to ""perform"" with the wife. Another huge relief.",Panic guy
45,Venlafaxine,Anxiety,10.0,,"March 18, 2021",3,"I was hesitant to start Venlaxafine which was prescribed by my GP. I googled all the reviews and side effect symptoms and of course, only the negative reviews stuck with me. One day, I just told myself No more searching the internet for reasons to not take this medication. No more trips to the ER just to get affirmation that I’m not dying. No more being scared and worried about things that haven’t happened yet. The first few days I had insomnia and I sweat a lot while sitting on the couch lol. I had moderate loss of appetite and lightheadedness. After the first week, I started to feel better. I feel much more calm and my overall mood uplifted. The only con for me is my inability to follow more than one conversation. The medication doesn’t allow my mind to race, so if I’m having a convo with someone and other people are talking loudly next to us, I have to hone in on the person I’m talking to. I’m invested in my conversations instead of nodding and glazing over.",Crich87

I have been on quite a few antidepressants previously, and my last antidepressant (Lexapro) sadly stopped working after a few years. After being admitted to the psych ward the doctors decided to put me on venlafaxine. It has been horrible. Panic attacks, uncontrollable shaking, nausea, vomiting, migraines and increased anxiety are some of the side effects I’ve experienced. Due to the severity of them I was put on benzodiazepines and sleeping meds for the first time in my life. After having been on it for 2 months with the side effects not going away I am now lowering the dose and will eventually stop the medication completely. The withdrawal isn’t fun, but it’s about the same as being on the meds. For some people venlafaxine is amazing and very effective, but it generally is less tolerated than other antidepressants such as Lexapro and Zoloft so keep that in mind.",Anya

I felt a bit sick in the stomach for a day, but that was it.Just allow yourself a day or two free days, just to be on the safe side.I've also done the same for 150mg Effexor to 100mg Pristiq.I've always tolerated Pristiq quite well.That's also how my doctor advised me to transition from Pristiq to Effexor as well. Just straight swap next day, also worked fine.Hope this helps.",Billy

I started on the 35mg dose and built up to the 75mg which I’ve now been on for a week. Before Venlafaxine I was anxious with negative thoughts escalating, making doing anything above the everyday a challenge. I had sore muscles from being tense. I would wake up in a panic and had diarrhoea. Now I’m a lot more relaxed. I still have the thoughts but they’re manageable. Starting was a bit nerve wracking and I found I didn’t sleep well the first 2 nights. I had a panic attack in the PM day 3. I checked in with my doctor who encouraged me to persevere and give it 2 weeks. After that I found it okay and upped dose.I found initially that I was sleepy (I take it AM) and I was clenching my jaw. The sleepiness has now eased, & I’m clenching less. I think the quality of my sleep has improved and I’m more optimistic. The only lasting side effect I’ve noticed is constipation, but it’s manageable.",Kiwi

If I didn’t take it exactly at the same time every day I would get dizziness and headaches and often had headaches even if I properly took it. I had constipation so I had to take meds for that. Then after a while the stomach pains started and only got worst until I had to start taking meds for that too. So after 8 years I felt it wasn’t working as well as before for the anxiety and I was fed up of the side effects so I decided to change meds.

And mentally I felt bogged down. I did too with 150mgs but not as much. I didn't notice much in side effects when I started taking it.

The company no longer offers free samples to my doctor so if and when I might need it due to a lack of funds, I can't get it from them.I'm trying to come off it and have buzzing zaps dominating my head.
