0,Vistaril,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 11, 2022",1,"I was given Vistaril for anxiety and sleep. It made my anxiety worse. When I took it for sleep it caused extreme restlessness of the arms and legs. I couldn't lay in the same position for more than a minute or two. Benadryl causes the same side effects and I told my doctor that, he said Vistaril was different. I could not sleep because my anxiety and restlessness were out of control.",xfreespirit79x
1,Vistaril,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 20, 2022",2,Reading these reviews made my anxiety worse about taking this drug. But let me tell you it helps. I’m on 50mg and I only take it as needed so if I’m feeling anxious I take and start to feel better within 15-20min. Definitely makes you a little sleepy but not to the point where you can’t do anything. And a bit of a dry mouth but other than that it works great.,Cmon
2,Vistaril,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 3, 2021",5,"I was on 3 mg Xanax for 8 years and weaned off. My anxiety returned and it was a horror show. I trembled all night long, I vomited twice from anxiety, my mind started thinking suicidal thoughts, as if my mind was searching for relief. Words cannot describe how horrible it was. I was absolutely determined to get back on Xanax because what I was experiencing was simply intolerable. My doctor prescribed this and I was certain it wouldn’t work. The first day I felt jittery and cold. The second day I woke up and didn’t want to vomit. I thought it was too good to be true. There is no way an antihistamine could help my anxiety. However it is working. I feel great, I’m focused, confident, calm, alert, sleep well. It’s so weird, zero anxiety and clear as a bell. Thank God for this.",Relief
3,Vistaril,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 26, 2021",2,I was prescribed vistaril when I was in the ER for a panic attack at work. Took the medication once a day when needed. Did not feel anything or any better. 5 days later I got hot and panicky and almost fell out at work. Back to the ER and was prescribed 50mg of vistaril (took the 50mg as prescribed for 2 weeks) and I was completely out of my mind and experiencing multiple panic attacks a day and was in tears consistently. Vistaril put me in a really dark place. My eyelids began to swell and I started breaking out in a rash. I went to the ER again and they told me I wasn’t having an allergic reaction to the medication and that I should not discontinue the medication until seen by PCP. Ha! I immediately stopped taking it and have been of fit for 2 days and I feel as I’m withdrawing. So a total of 3 weeks I was severely depressed and it put me in a dark place. Everybody’s experience was different but mine was a complete nightmare!! Ready to feel normal again.,Kylie
4,Vistaril,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 24, 2021",1,"If I could give this drug a 0 I would, Vistaril doesn’t work at all, for me at least. I laid in bed for so many hours just waiting to fall asleep and couldn’t. There are so many better anxiety and sleeping pills. I was just prescribed 30 mg Ristoril and I love it. I would say it saved my life as a life with insomnia is no life at all.",aydiosdeveras

6,Vistaril,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 29, 2021",0,"Ive been taking Vistaril for about 2 months now. I take a 25mg at night for sleeping, and a 50mg during the day if needed. It helps a LOT in the moment of a panic attack or just high anxiety. It usually takes about 25 minutes to kick in. The only issues I've found is that on occasion some side effects like blurry vision and diarrhea get in the way. The biggest issue I've found with it Vistaril is that it usually makes me depressed and irritable later in the day or even the next day. I'd strongly suggest notifying loved ones that you've taken one, and need some space. Over all it's nice for in-the-moment relief, but has some nasty side effects.",Samuel

8,Vistaril,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 5, 2021",2,Not your typical anxiolytics like Klonopin but it is alright. I was in psych. hospital and all they gave out was this stuff. It wasn't Klonopin but it did suffice my needs while in the hospital. I decided to take this over Buspar. I tried Buspar twice in the past and both times it was a miss and not a hit. I have other symptoms and that's why I'm taking Lexapro as well. The two combinations work fine for me.,Psych4

10,Vistaril,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 14, 2021",10,I have been on it for a year now. I have Bipolar 2 and came off all meds about three years ago. I have treatment resistant depression. I identified negative thoughts as a big trigger for bringing me down (I get suicide ideation). I wanted something to use when my other techniques to stop the thoughts did not work. This drug works for me. It helps quiet my mind so I can sleep and I sometimes use it in the day if I'm having a really hard time. Then I take an Adderall as well to help with the sleepy problem. I only use it as and when I need it which is perfect for what I was looking for.,MVS
11,Vistaril,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 11, 2021",133,I've been prescribed this three times for anxiety and PTSD and sleep. It works for none of these things and I really don't like it. I know they use it to avoid benzos but I would rather have actual relief. I have no addictive tendencies and I’m exhausted of panic and anxiety. I’m prescribed this but rarely take it. Also the more you take it the less it works.,True

More consistently for the past two years, it truly does help with anxiety, and is far safer than Benzo’s. I got hooked on benzos and had to withdrawal over a year- that was fun (insert sarcasm). The only negative I can list for Vistaril, is that the day after I take a Vistaril (I only take PRN) I’m in the worst mood. I even tell my husband, I had a vistaril yesterday, so leave me be.

15,Vistaril,Anxiety,1.0,,"February 28, 2020",79,my dr prescribed me this  Vistaril and I hate it. Does absolutely nothing for panic attacks. It didn’t even make me drowsy like Benadryl does. I upped the dose and nothing happened. Pretty pointless medication,anxious annie
16,Vistaril,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 21, 2020",241,"I have suffered extreme anxiety, panic disorder, and PTSD.I've been using this for over a week now (Prescribed at up to 100mg a day as needed but the highest dose I've taken has been 75mg). Just messing around with dosage to figure it out. This has been my saving grace for the time I've been in it. I'm glad it's not a benzo as I had a hard time coming off of it. With Vistril my panic attacks are fewer now in the week that I've been taking it. I do recommend this medication because I believe it fully works for anxiety. At least for mine :-)",Tranquilthought

18,Vistaril,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 29, 2020",300,"This does little if nothing for me.  Causes severe dry mouth which can lead to tooth decay. I have never in my sixty years on earth bought a drug from the streets.  However. The low dose prescription klonopin I took for many years with no issues.  The government has made it a hassle for doctors to prescribe benzos. They  will throw everything else at you despite side effects and lack of it actually working.  For persons with serious anxiety, buspar, visteral, lexapro do not work. I have tried them all. Benzos are a drug used in the treatment of anxiety for a decade and for most used safely.  It is  not the drug that is the problem they are safe and effective if used properly. As long as there are people wanting to abuse drugs there will be addiction problems. Great if visteral worked but it does not for me.",Manny

It used to help a lot when I was on other anxiety meds, and when I needed an extra boost. I stopped taking it for a good few months, but the last few times I've taken it have been awful.

20,Vistaril,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 26, 2019",37,"The WORST experience of my life! Took one 25mg Vistaril and had the worst panic attack of my life and had harmful thoughts! Never would recommend this drug to anyone. I couldn't breathe, stop crying, and kept having suicidal thoughts like thoroughly hated myself and wanted to slit my throat. It's the day after I took it and I feel very depressed, I have a horrible headache, and it's hard for me to breathe. I have never cried so hard in my life and I'm hyperventilating that horribly until I took that stupid medication. On top of it, it didn't even work for allergies or sedation like it's supposed to. I would have voted it 0 out of 10 but the lowest it goes is 1 and a hyperventilating that horribly , until I took that stupid medication. It didn't even work for allergies or sedation like it's supposed to. You're better off just taking Benadryl an antihistamine.",Anxiety Sufferer
21,Vistaril,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 15, 2019",196,"Listen Vitaril pretty decent for anxiety! I was on this 25mg 3x daily and it has helped take off the edge, it doesn't stop it 100% but with other medication and proper anxiety relief techniques, this will help you immensely with anxiety. However since I'm a teen drop out (due to anxiety) I can sleep 9 hours and then sleep another 9 hours W/O feeling tired at all (great side affect- I like). I highly recommend this for people with panic attacks! Don't listen to the scary reviews if you truely have tried everything except meds TRY THIS and don't be scared...",Spitty
22,Vistaril,Anxiety,1.0,,"November 23, 2019",37,"My doctor prescribed this medication as needed for anxiety a few days ago. She told me to take 25 to 50 mg a day, as needed. I took 25 mg and it was horrible. I had chest tightness, felt like I couldn't breathe. Chest pain, the pain was shooting through to my back. I thought about going to the ER. I still had anxiety yesterday, took the vistaril the day before. Still dealing with anxiety today. I don't think I'll ever take it again. The anxiety I had before wasn't this bad. Just to let everyone know, I don't take benzos for anxiety. One of the reviews for this medication made a comment about people taking benzos, it said that's why people don't like Vistaril because they would rather have benzos, that is not the case. This medication doesn't work well for some people. I have better results using my DARE app, and meditation.",CM
23,Vistaril,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 21, 2019",20,I was prescribed this medication for insomnia and anxiety. Prescription said take 2 pills 25 mg twice daily as needed. I took one pill before sleep and it did not help at all for a couple days. Then I tried 2 pills. Walked to my bedroom and passed out en route. I was knocked unconscious. Woke up with severely broken ankle and drenched in sweat on bedroom floor. Very terrifying  experience I regret taking these pills. No warning of this effect was mentioned to me. I blacked out from them. I was also taking Trintillex for about 2 weeks for depression. Don't know if this contributed to the blackout. I was told they were mild like benadryl but calming. Not the case for me. Too late now have 2 more weeks of broken ankle non weight bearing and I am very angry I was prescribed this drug.,Dee

Very soon after taking the first one my anxiety tripled and I began having back to back panic attacks.  After a call to the doctor I was told to take a higher dose. Long story short, for whatever reason, I can not take this medication.  It has the complete opposite effect on me as it should.",Mbminga
25,Vistaril,Anxiety,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 9, 2019",40,"My psychiatrist prescribed me Vistaril for anxiety after trying plenty of other drugs. (Celexa, Lexapro and Klonopin I was also trying other drugs like Prozac, Ritalin and intuniv). The first couple days it had made me tired but a like with all antihistamines I've ever taken, it wears off incredibly quickly and I build a tolerance quite quickly. I was specifically prescribed it for anxiety but as far as that goes, I haven't noticed a difference whatsoever. My anxiety is pretty severe and I've had it since I was really young. Although, everyone is different and this will work differently for everyone. I have been taking it for about three and a half weeks and the only reason I still take it is because I get nausea and allergies. But I haven't noticed a dent in my anxiety with it. I've always needed something relatively strong for my anxiety.",Lea
26,Vistaril,Anxiety,4.0,,"July 11, 2019",45,"This is really not a drug for people with serious, long-term issues with anxiety. But it's also the lowest-risk prescription a Doctor can write, so expect to get this as a first line treatment in lieu of any personalized care. I have taken Vistaril on-and-off for nearly 10 years and while it does help in some specific circumstances, it's just not a particularly effective drug. It basically produces a mild sedative effect that can take some of the edge off of background anxiety.  If you take it on a daily basis, expect the benefits to fade somewhat. Increasing the dosage just makes you more drowsy and the side effects worse.  If you can identify in advance circumstances that make your anxiety worse, taking a Vistaril before that can help alleviate things a bit. This drug will not stop or even really affect an imminent anxiety or panic attack, and even at it's most effective it won't help with many of the side effects of anxiety (rapid heart beat, trembling, numbness etc)",Anonymous

It has worked well and allowed me to function without panic attacks and calms me and keeps me out of fight or flight mode. Life has just been easier entirely. I have had some mild to moderate side effects specifically, a few headaches, impaired coordination and occasional dizziness. I personally would take that over the mind crushing anxiety.

30,Vistaril,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 6, 2019",40,This drug is amazingly sedating. After reading the reviews I was reluctant to take it thinking it would not work. Boy was I wrong. Sadly I am starting antidepressant therapy and my anxiety is through the roof. I was given Ativan but am reluctant to take it often for fear of tolerance and addition. The Vistaril has really worked at calming me down after increased anxiety especially when worrying when trying to fall off to sleep. It shut down the worry and made me slow down which in my case is what I needed. I only took 10mg and caution against driving or other activities until you know how it will affect you.,Nikkiblue42
31,Vistaril,Anxiety,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 16, 2019",25,"I have been taking Vistaril for about 5 days as a replacement for Klonepin.  I loved the low dose Klonepin but after several years it now has affected my short term memory.  The Vistaril, since it is like an antihistamine, has such drying effects on me that I am always hoarse and have migraines due to dehydration. My anxiety is not severe but it does alter my personality when it's bad. I don't find that this rx helps me at all. I still have my anxiety ticks, chest pain and Shortnes Of Breath (SOB).

When my doctor retires or I lose health insurance coverage I have been prescribed vistaril by family practice doctors that don't like prescribing benzodiazepines. For me it does stop panic attacks and calms me. Also helps with sleeping. The only downside is it is less effective over time unlike klonopin or ativan which never loses its efficacy.

Although Vistaril is gentle & easy going for the first hour or so, a strong drowsiness will come on by Hour #2.

I have switched doctors and am currently on 0.5mg of Xanax 2 x day and it takes care of all my symptoms. ,blottobox
183,Vistaril,Anxiety,1.0,,"December 31, 2009",79,"I get really bad panic attacks and suffer from panic disorder with agoraphobia.  My doctor tries to steer away from benzos because of the addiction factor, which is understandable.  However, Vistaril has done nothing for me.  It's as if I'm taking sugar pills.  If I'm suffering from an exceptionally bad panic attack, I still have to be taken to the E.R. where they give me benzos anyway.",Anonymous
184,Vistaril,Anxiety,3.0,,"May 19, 2009",17,I've been taking Vistaril 25 mg for 3 weeks and it has not helped me what so ever. At first I felt a little less nervous but when I had to go to an assembly it kicked right back up! Now I'm getting ready to get on Lexapro. Hopefully this drug works for me.,Anonymous

188,Vistaril,Anxiety,8.0,,"June 3, 2008",180,"I have extreme anxiety attacks that make it hard for me to breathe, which makes the oxygen levels in my brain go down. I have found that it helps me calm down to the point where I can rationalize the stress and anxiety that is causing the attack. I also find that when I am nauseous it helps me not vomit.",MuhLee08
