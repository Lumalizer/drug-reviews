0,Tramadol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 9, 2022",1,"I've been on several anxiety and depression and panic attacks meds for as long as I can remember. After having covid the panic attacks got so severe that I had them daily. (I'm a smoker so that doesn't help any ).I was even getting only 3 to 4 hours sleep at night. After talking to my doctor about this she put me on a low dose of 25mg of tramadol. I have been taken it for 2 weeks now and my mood, anxiety, depression and even sleeping has improved some. I would seriously recommend it. I do have the side effect of some dizziness at times though.",Pennyles
1,Tramadol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 30, 2022",0,Tramadol 50 mg once a day or sometimes I split an extra one and take 25 mg making a total of 75 mg helps me tremendously with both pain and anxiety.  It doesn't make me tired I can do whatever I normally do. To me it is a solution to what I needed.. it may not work for everyone the same because I've tried different things everybody is different but I would recommend trying it to anyone who suffers from pain or anxiety,Karen

3,Tramadol,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 21, 2021",2,"Got given tramadol for gallbladder pain I was having. I've suffered with anxiety/ depression most of my life and been on all sorts of medications.  I didn't feel any benefit from any of them but didn't want to just stop them. The tramadol, I found wasn't great for pain but I started to  realise that when I did take them my anxiety was a lot less. I take 50mg in the morning and another in evening. This medicine has turned me from being an absolute emotional wreck who was constantly having thoughts of impending doom and struggling to leave the house, into a person who now feels alive again. Have stopped all other antidepressants.  Hopefully my GP will continue to prescribe it me.",Skitty
4,Tramadol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 6, 2021",5,"Wish it wasn't so vilified. Feel guilty for using it sometimes. Tried anti-dep- doesn't work. Need something to work very quickly for my PTSD when flashbacks starts. 20-30 min before effect; Tramadol is really great, gives back a feeling of being in control over the cascade of memories rushing in, and the rip-current of panic & what feels like constant life & death battles. ""Just survive the next 20 min"" is my island. Knowing it won't feel AS bad in a short while, is so indescribable an effect. It makes it easier to not jump into something acutely rushed bad solutions. It's easier trying to focus on building a more longterm life, when I know I have a crisis option that works. Also easier to do therapy. If we feel/know the subjects might be a bit potent we can prepare ourselves before the session has ended, knowing the bad memories won't have as much hijacking power over us, makes me calmer. I don't view it as a solution for life. Working on/hoping not needing it the long run. But empowering for now.",Vivo

6,Tramadol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 25, 2021",4,"I really hope that someday soon Tramadol will be able to be prescribed for the treatment of anxiety and depression, as I find it to be perfect. I only take one a day for three days for really bad depressive episodes that I don't have the strength to get through medication-free. It always ALWAYS helps: it gives me the ability to think rationally and break away from my episodes, and I understand and respect that it is the opiate content that makes me feel happier and can also be dangerous if taken abusively. Side effects for me include euphoria, increased sociability, dry mouth and loss of appetite (which I quite like as it results in increased hydration (good for the skin) and weight loss, respectively). It frustrates me to hear when people get Tramadol over-prescribed to them for physical pain yet I can't even get it for mental pain.",Bird
7,Tramadol,Anxiety,10.0,,"May 20, 2021",12,Tramadol.25mg per night (half 50mg)Is the only relief from anxiety after 40 years of trying so many pills.Started after knee replacement.18 months.No side effects.No desire to increaseAlthough 50mg is better .Now concerned cannot prescribe for anxiety.So may have to return to daily misery.Or legal occasional 50ml doses of vodka!!,StickyGreen
8,Tramadol,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 13, 2021",49,"Been on tramadol many years, The VA  passed them out like candy, they put me on it for back pain, I noticed right away it gave me energy and keep me alert - it has never done anything for my pain. I still take it 15 years later every day, I still take it for energy and a little more go. I’ve spoken with many people that use it daily for the same reasons I do.

9,Tramadol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 27, 2021",102,"For years I've been told I’m depressed & anxious but it’s more than that.  As a child I suffered extreme emotional abuse but have never received any help apart from a brief period of an anti-psychotic.  For at least 5 years I’ve been trying to get heard/listened to/help but nothing.  I want to commit suicide every day but can’t as I have children & won't leave them with that legacy.  I’m completely shut down & withdrawn & if I knew where to get hold of it would have taken heroin to just disappear for a while.  It then occurred to me that tramadol is an opiate that I’ve got for back injury & 4 days ago decided to try it for my head.  I can’t explain the difference I’m able to achieve things not big things but things not possible before, I’m able to watch a film & all I can think is that this is how most people feel.  It’s a glorious feeling of freedom.",Julz
10,Tramadol,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 20, 2021",6,"I didn’t realize how bad my anxiety was until I took this drug. I used to use kratom but it started making me feel badly, I think because of its stimulating nature. Luckily, in the country I am living now, I can purchase tramadol over the counter for very cheap. I have only been taking 25mg every other day, as I do not want to become dependent on it. 25mg (half a capsule) makes me feel calm, fearless and peaceful. I rate 9 because I am unsure of long term effects and generally I do not trust pharmaceuticals. But overall, it is working great so far.",Cccc
11,Tramadol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 26, 2020",14,I have suffered from anxiety nearly all my life and have been on medication after medication with only fair results. My husband has a severe leg and back injury and uses Tramadol. On a holiday I hurt my back and took his 100mg SR tramadol daily for over a week and the transformation in my mood and anxiety was life changing. My GP told me that it is well know as a treatment for anxiety but Australian medical professionals shy away from prescribing the drug for this purpose. Why?? I thank Tramadol every day for lifting the anxiety fog I was constantly living in!,LinLu
12,Tramadol,Anxiety,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 11, 2020",19,I have struggled with chronic anxiety and depression all my life and took Benzodiazepines for 13 years. I thought they were the worst to withdrawal from then I tried to withdraw from tramadol. I was taking 50 to 150mg a day for sciatica but realised they helped my anxiety or thought they did. When you stop Tramadol the anxiety comes back 10 times worse. I couldn't move my body for days one time because of the pain I was experiencing. EVERYTHING comes back worse. I will however take one 50mg if I am having a panic attack as I get addicted to Benzos and cannot take them again. Please be very careful especially if you have an addictive personality!,Anais Anais
13,Tramadol,Anxiety,10.0,,"September 26, 2020",87,"Like so many others, I discovered the anti-anxiety and anti-OCD effects of Tramadol. Tramadol was originally prescribed after I moved from opium derived drugs to Tramadol, I noticed a much calmer sense of myself and attitude. I have suffered from anxiety and obsessive-compulsive behaviors for three decades. I take 50 mg in the morning. I have been doing this now for 21 months and my level of agitation is significantly diminished. I don't drink now nor engage in other self-destructive and obsessive behaviors. On occasion, I will take a second 50 mg late afternoon if I have a stressful or intense meeting or work engagement upcoming. I long ago stopped getting any pain relief from this drug. I have to argue with my primary physician for refills. I test the effects by stopping the drug for 1-3 weeks every 5-6 months. Eventually, the anxiety returns and it becomes as real as the past. I have never suffered any withdrawals coming off of 50-100 mg daily dose.",Telemark1

16,Tramadol,Anxiety,8.0,,"July 29, 2020",35,"I just wanted to some helpful advice. Tramadol is great for anxiety. The advice I want to give is for anyone that runs out before your refill date. You will have withdrawals during this time period and they suck! No sugar coating...they suck! I came across a forum about a year ago about Kratom as a helpful tool for withdrawals. I was desperate so I tried it. OMG! It is literally a miracle when dealing withdrawal symptoms from tramadol! I can't say this enough! I understand how some people have stopped pain meds all together with it. Its good for pain, anxiety, mood lifting. It attaches to a different opioid receptor, but is enough to keep you from having withdrawal symptoms...and MUCH better for you than prescription drugs!",happy

My anxiety has been so high in my recent years and depression hits hard. I was prescribed tramadol 3 times a day and for this past year my anxiety went from a 10 to a 1 or 2.

19,Tramadol,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 23, 2020",16,"great for anxiety/depression as it is an SNRI/opiate in one. You are benefiting from the snri effect on your mood, you're also daily consuming the opiate which WILL cause addiction/dependency. There are SNRI’s  that don't have an opioid but I doubt they are as effective. You may not be getting high off the opiate but part of the boost is due to the opiate. There is no doubt  that its useful for pain or mood and if it helps then so be it, just thought I'd put my two cents out there. Having days of a sense causes severe negative effects. I’d strongly advise tapering if you choose to stop after daily consumption . I don’t understand how people are saying I swear doctors get paid not to give tramadol and instead prescribe other marketed products. answer is no educated doctor would Prescribe a partial opiate to someone for daily use for anxiety/depression it’s just not sensible addiction and dependence is real and scary.",Sam

21,Tramadol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 30, 2020",22,"Tramadol is a life saver. Like most I was prescribed it for pain and when I first took it I noticed I just felt a bit happier. NOTHING like a buzz, just a better mood. Time went on and I realized even taken early in the AM, it would keep me up at night. So I stopped. A couple of years later a friend mentioned he had it and my anxiety had been worsening so I figured I'd try it. Game changer. I take 2-3 (I'm a 190 lb male) and the difference it makes in my mood is incredible. I highly recommend this for people with anxiety and even depression.",Harlan Thrimplestock

I have come off the SSRIs and only use 50mg Tramadol as required, Certainly not every day or even every week. I have no side effects and definitely no dependency.

27,Tramadol,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 1, 2020",93,"Tramadol helped me tremendously to feel more present and thus less anxious. It is a good idea to expose people to tramadol in low to moderate dosage.Psychiatrists are under pressure to exclude it and are backed by ""research"" funded by pharma companies that recommend ""their"" drugs. Where is the money, you ask? Nobody wants to hear about how tramadol helped your depression and or anxiety.Pharma doesn't send  your psychiatrist  to Maui to prescribe tramadol for your depression. It is sad that such a powerful medication, not less habitual or addictive than the other stuff, is labeled as addictive, habit forming and plain dangerous.Those who know tramadol  (up to 100 mg a day, or just 50mg) will attest to its life changing qualities.

33,Tramadol,Anxiety,10.0,,"September 12, 2019",78,I previously rated Tramadol for depression (miracle) and now it time to rave about anxiety relief. I strongly believe psychiatrists are not paid to prescribe tramadol. They will tell you how addictive it is all while prescribing you psych meds with tenfold side effects.I find the mechanism of how Tramadol works fascinating. I see  no reason to shy away from 50mg daily.I find most people here forgetting to state how much they're taking. Tramadol is a game changer. It may not work for some people based on their liver enzymes (connected to ancestry and hereditary). But hey you won't know till late you tried. A miracle medication with low addiction potential if you keep it on low dose  (50mg daily in my case).,Makpaz

44,Tramadol,Anxiety,4.0,,"August 31, 2018",32,"I took this medication for anxiety and depression and it worked miracles. Then I ran out of it and went through awful withdrawals. This drug is a narcotic with very addictive properties meaning it will very often lead to drug-seeking behavior. Heroin takes away depression but that doesn’t make it a good antidepressant because you need something long term that addresses the issue or you will end up worse off. So yes, I took this and it helped my depression and anxiety but I had to always make sure it was available to me. A tolerance will build up fast and this medication has a dose limit to how much you can take a day because it increases the risk of seizures. You may not even take close to the top dose now and may never, but if you read this, haven’t genuinely tried several other legitimate options, and are concerned, ask your doctor why they prescribed this to you and ask if you can take it for anxiety or depression.",Aminal
