0,Paxil,Anxiety,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 4, 2022",0,"I was on Paxil 10mg for a total of five weeks after trying CipraLex and having horrific panic attacks and extreme exhaustion. The exhaustion was not bad with Paxil but I continued to have panic attacks that would wake me up throughout the night and be so bad I would need to take Ativan almost every night. I reduced to 5 mg and it was a bit better but I still had insomnia and anxiety and frequent panic attacks. There are a lot of reviews on here saying you need to wait through some bad times until it gets better, but after five weeks I decided I couldn’t take it anymore and I was advised by my psychiatrist that I was probably not tolerant of SSRIs in general. To be honest detoxing from Paxil after only going on for five weeks was worse than the actual time on the drug itself. I experienced increased panic attacks and overall anxiety, brain zaps, and terrible terrible insomnia. Because my old insomnia and anxiety was why I went on a small dose in the beginning, it was terrifying.",Leia

2,Paxil,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 16, 2022",2,"I had severe anxiety as a child that only got worse until I started paroxetine, I used to have panic attacks multiple times a day and it was affecting my ability to go to school, interact with people, have a job or sleep. I lived in constant fear and couldn't talk to people without overthinking it. Once I started on paroxetine I have a more relaxed attitude, less overthinking and I'm not living in fear. It's like my anxiety was never there. I have a customer service job that I enjoy and don't overthink every interaction.  I don't experience the numbness/lack of emotions others reported, I have a full range of emotion and most of the time I feel content. I did gain a little weight (20lbs) but I'm not sure if that's a result of the medication or because I started taking it when I was 16 and my body is different. I stopped gaining weight at a certain point.The only really hard part about it is that I can't miss a dose or I get withdrawal with severe panic attacks",S.H

That is called PSSD.  Post ssri sexual dysfunction continued after I stop paxil, and I have to this day still PSSD. I have PSSD 12 years after I stopped PAXIL. Its like one part of me is missing.

5,Paxil,Anxiety,,,"November 26, 2021",0,I want to know how hard it is to get back to yourself after Paxil kicks in. I’m on 3 week and some anxiety is going away. I’m believing what most of you are posting that it takes longer for some people for it to start working. I have been on Paxil longer than 6 years with no problems. I had a fearful experience and the the doctor up the paxil to 20. It’s like starting over and I have some of the side effects.,Wands

Ten years ago I suffered for 4 years as doctors couldn’t find the right med. lately I’ve had some sad events and started having extreme anxiety. My doctor increased Paxil to 20mg. I’m suffering all the side effects. Will effects go away in two weeks? My children are coming for the holidays. Does anyone else use anti anxiety medicine along with Paxil? I do and everything was working good until the sad situations happened in my life. Also, right now I start feeling better at night. When will I start feeling better during the day?

7,Paxil,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 6, 2021",3,"Paxil took me out of a really dark place. I started having anxiety when I was 20. It came on suddenly and I felt like I was losing my mind. A doctor started me on Paxil. I took it for several years until another doctor switched me to Lexapro, only because THEY didn't like Paxil. I was on Lexapro for awhile but my anxiety came back pretty suddenly,  along with depression. I was hospitalized and started back on Paxil, since it worked in the past. I soon felt like myself again. I was on it for 10 years until I got pregnant. It's not pregnancy safe apparently, so I was switched back to Lexapro. I sadly had a miscarriage. I stayed on Lexapro for about 9 months, then suddenly my anxiety came back full force. I was switched to Prozac, which I still take only because I'm trying to conceive. I miss Paxil though. I felt it helped me the best. I was able to move on for several years and live a ""normal"" life. I also have OCD and it helped with the intrusive thoughts.",kirstenmd
8,Paxil,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 4, 2021",6,"I struggled with anxiety after High school. I worked in the process industry for 2 years working shift work, and knew I was struggling with Anxiety. I went to the ER multiple times thinking I was sick or having a  heart attack. I joined the Service and served 4 years, and once I finished my service, my Wife said I needed to talk with a Doctor. After 6 years of putting it off, I finally did. The doctor first put me on Buspirone. It was awful I had night sweats, rapid heart beat, restless nights, couldn't sleep, it was brutal. I switched doctors, and my new doctor said I should try Paxil (paroxetine). It has changed my life! I have minimal side effects, (small dizzy spells, and small anxiety spikes) but I am not going to the doctor every three months, I actually enjoy things again, I am more relaxed and not wound so tight. I hope this helps people that struggle with anxiety want to give it a try.",Anxiety sucks

I have been on Effexor, celexa, lexapro, Zoloft, and other medications. Paxil I would say is one of the best medications I've ever been on. It really helps me with anxiety and depression. Other ssris have not been as effective as this one. If you struggle with anxiety or depression I highly recommend trying Paxil. It is very effective for anxiety, and depression also.",john

13,Paxil,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 6, 2021",3,This drug has changed my life. My anxiety has been decreased significantly. It started working within the first week and I’ve been on for about seven weeks now. I used to ruminate frequently and feel dread thinking about the next work day or scary thing I had to do. It’s so much better. I left this comment in hopes that someone with severe anxiety will give this a try. Can’t believe I suffered for so long. I just assumed that antidepressant couldn’t touch my anxiety. Well I stand corrected! My libido is low but who cares… the dread and extreme social anxiety is gone.,Cmccr
14,Paxil,Anxiety,6.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 28, 2021",3,"Paxil is a good drug, but it will become less effective. I was on Paxil for 20 years. Every time I built a tolerance up they pumped up my dose until I was taking 60 mg, which is maxed out. Eventually it happened again, my body adjusted and it wasn't working well. The problem is that getting off of Paxil can be a total nightmare. I tried to taper the way my Dr told me but I'd get so miserable. My anxiety was horrible, I couldn't sleep, I had all sorts of strange tingling, I got horrible brain zaps (definitely the worst part of Paxil withdrawal) Every 6 months or so I'd go down a tiny bit, sometimes cutting slivers off pills with razor blades. In 3 years I went from 60 to 20 mg. I knew this low dose wasn't working, and I needed to switch meds. I went from 20 to 0 in a month with Prozac to help with the withdrawal. I stopped Paxil 4 days ago. I am miserable but hopeful I can finally move past Paxil and find the right new meds. When it works it's great, but stopping can be horrific.",Julie

17,Paxil,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 20, 2021",3,"I started paxil about a year ago. When I first started it, I honestly didn’t know if I was feeling any effects on it. My anxiety that was produced by my BPD was still through the roof, so I stopped taking it after about two months. Fast forward to about 4 months ago, I was dealing with some pretty heavy stuff so I decided to try Paxil again. It truly has been a game changer. I’m less anxious, more clear-headed, and less depressed as well. I’m able to go through difficult situations without completely shutting down. It truly has helped me so much. Only thing I will say is that it does cause vaginal dryness, which really sucks. But my libido really hasn’t been affected all that much, which is great. Paxil has also reduced my appetite a lot which is good for me since I suffer from binge eating. If you are just starting paxil and aren’t seeing any affects; be patient. It’ll come.",BPD

But I got on paxil first 20 mg and I starting feeling  better within a week or two and after a month I felt a lot better and going up 10 more mg I feel great. Probably better than I ever felt. I enjoy life now. No more worrying about things that may or may not happen. I enjoy my husband and my fur babies. I personally have no side effects. I take it first thing in the morning at the same time..I was on paxil in the past after an abusive relation and it helped me get my self esteem back and I let go of the fear and depression.

I started to feel some anxiety symptoms like 6 months ago but I did not get help till things started to get really messy. I had panic attack every hour and felt severe dissociation. I started using 20 mg paxil in the mornings 3 weeks ago. In the middle of my treatment my doctor gave me 1.5 mg risperdal and additional 20 mg prozac. Once the side effects are gone you start to feel better gradually. This morning was my best morning of past 3 weeks. I will continue to take paxil and hope my situation gets better.,Orhund

I was worried to try it, but am so grateful I did. For the first month I would take it at night and would wake up from nausea every night. I suggest taking it during the day! Sometimes I get a little dizzy, especially if I forget to take it, but don't mind that too much. My perfectionism and social anxiety was destroying my work and relationships, and now I am productive, focused, and so stable!! If you are considering, try Paxil out!

25,Paxil,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 17, 2021",21,"I have been taking paxil for 27 years.  It really helped me with depression and anxiety.   However, after menopause I felt I had too much in my system -- i.e. no emotions so I started to wean off very slowly.  5 mg every 3-4 months to avoid withdrawal symptoms.   I successfully got down to 10 mg.  I tried lowering to 5mg but got very bad anxiety.  So I went back up to 10 mg.   This seems to work fine and I will stay on this dosage for now.   I did gain about 50lbs after taking paxil - although part of that was bad eating!  Since then I have lost a good chunk of the weight through healthy eating and exercise.   So overall the drug has worked well for me - but it took over a year to go from 20mg to 10mg very slowly so i didn't have bad withdrawal symptoms.",deedee

27,Paxil,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 7, 2021",6,"Not everybody is going to have the same sensitivity to this drug Paroxetine.  I was timid to start the drug, and started with 10mg.  My Psychiatrist told me to do 20mg otherwise I'd only be messing around with it.  I did the 20mg... nothing.  We put it up to 30mg, then 40mg.  As it's a reuptake inhibitor, you need to have serotonin in your body for this stuff to work with.  So we added Mirtazapine 30mg to the mix.  Still nothing  until a couple of weeks later about week 8, then it started to improve how I talk to and mix with other people.  A few brain zaps are happening now but they are fun and they happen when I would normally have started to melt down in a panic attack.  I'm not sure how long I'll be on this stuff 40mg seems a lot.  It's not as weak as water but it's not much better. :)",GregoryJ
28,Paxil,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 21, 2020",22,"This medication get so many bad reviews but it can be great. Turns out I’m extremely sensitive to SSRIs. I had to start at 2mg Paxil name brand and move up. I’m at a month on 3.5-5mg alternating every day as of now along with TMS treatment. Even just this much has helped. My mood is getting better, I talk more. Less anxiety, my hair pulling has subsided. Stuttering has really decreased which is great. I feel it working and my sleep has been better. I would wake up at 2-3am in a panic about uni and other matters and would stay up all night. Or, never fall asleep and only sleep at around 7am. Now I fall asleep at 11pm-12am and get up 6-7am again. This medicine treats almost everything I have and helps with PTSD. If you try it and you notice it works for you but can’t take the side effects, start low on a liquid suspension. 1-2mg then build. No starting side effects.",Tubby
29,Paxil,Anxiety,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 19, 2020",37,"I was on Paxil for 3-4 years starting at 10 mg a day to I think 50mg a day? My Dr kept upping the dose as my mood wasn’t really lifting, it made me so drowsy, my Dr told me it would go away but it never did. What I initially loved about it was the calmness I had, I could handle social settings with ease! BUT, then came the other side, I was just so spaced out, people at worked noticed me staring into space and would ask if I was ok!! Then one day driving to the store I made a left turn and smashed into another car.  No one was hurt, cops came and as I sat on the curb people asked if I was ok, one guy told me I seemed out of it. I saw the car coming, but my reactions were slow. To this day I believe me being on Paxil contributed to the crash. I stopped cold turkey which was awful! Never ever do that . Paxil warns about driving and operating heavy machinery. It might work amazing for some, every one is different. Happiness to all:)",SunFlower

For what little anxiety I felt I had, it works great. I flew for the first time and felt no anxiety at all, I was like, Wow, this is what it feels like to be normal. However for depression, I still do get sad, although that may just be me (my therapy sessions are rather useless). At first when taking this I was on cloud 9. I was feeling great, and I had no appetite at all so I lost 8 pounds. Once I got used to eating without being hungry, my appetite got back to normal. I also started getting constipated while taking this, so my Dr. prescribed me Miralax. I also have noticed that it seems to have dulled my senses down there, it takes longer to have an orgasm which is frustrating. I have heard about how this is a difficult drug to get off of, which I am nervous about.

I would genuinely not recommend this medication to anyone suffering from depression or any other ailments for that matter; I wouldn’t risk it even if the doctor was sure it was going to work.

I am only on 4 weeks but I am going to switch back to Prozac. I am taking 10mg Paxil and I am constantly tired. I feel out of it. It has helped with anxiety  and heart palpitations but instead of giving me a sense of clarity when I am annoyed or anxious I am overwhelmed with a sense of exhaustion...like a sedative feeling. Not much of an appetite either. Zero sex drive. I hope the Prozac will work again and it’s not that my body chemistry has changed.,Nm

I called the hospice literally 30 seconds after she was pronounced.  I felt little. My sister called me a minute later. She was hysterical and driving to get to the hospice. I just wanted to be with her on the phone to make sure she got there. I am a NYer living in Italy and now, I must wait for her ashes to arrive here. A lengthy process so I cannot consider beginning closure. I am not depressed, though relieved. I am not panicking. I am just feeling pain in my chest, so tight, that I cannot let out what I believe I would be feeling. I feel like a machine.

The only main side effect I've had in transitioning to the higher dosage was severe mania for the first couple of days. It wore off significantly as the days passed. As for the weight gain that ""Paxil causes"", I think it's just that I'm not so anxious to the point of nausea and disgust in food. I love eating and enjoy my food again!

Sometimes I take half a pill or skip days when I feel I need to get more things done, or I want my boyfriend to be happy.

While I was no longer depressed feeling on Zoloft, I realized that was getting stressed out about little things. I have always been ""high strung"" and full of energy.  Since starting Paxil I have calmed down and I am able to relax. I have just started taking Niravam for high stress moments. I have gained weight and I am also tired feeling, but the peace of mind is worth it",Anonymous
