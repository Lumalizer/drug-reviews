0,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 27, 2022",3,I have severe anxiety and panic attacks and had an emergency reaction to SSRIs and I don't want to be on a benzos. Hydroxyzine is the only medication that gives me some relief. I mostly treat my anxiety through therapy but every once in awhile when I am just having a really hard time I take Hydroxyzine. The 10mg dose is so little that I feel like I can still go about my day without much grogginess at all and still have some relief.,Anonymous
1,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 26, 2022",3,"I’m prescribed this medication for generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and borderline personality disorder. While this medication isn’t great for day to day anxiety in my experience, it works really good on an as needed basis. When I take it daily it just… doesn’t do anything. It is an antihistamine after all, so all it does is make you sleepy. I find it also works great on an as needed basis for insomnia, or nights when I have issues sleeping too. I take other medications to manage my mental health conditions, but hydroxzyine works great when my anxiety is high in the moment and in moments where I need something to calm me down. Besides sedation and dry mouth, no other side effects or problems.",Mime

I get severe anxiety at night and often have trouble sleeping but taking 25mg makes me feel completely relaxed within 30 minutes. It calms my mind so much and doesn't knock me out, but makes me a little drowsy and puts me in the right mindset to fall asleep. It helps with an anxious stomach too.

10,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Anxiety,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 23, 2022",1,I have bipolar. This medicine combats anxiety by PUTTING YOU INTO A COMA. I take low doses 10mg as a PRN and it still knocks me out for a good 9+ hours. I also feel kinda depressed the next day after taking it. I avoid taking this unless I really can’t sleep after taking Seroquel. It’s not addictive like benzos but it doesn’t help bipolar-related anxiety.,Concave

I kept saying to Dr about being exhausted all day and he never mentioned this was used as a sedative!  I had even asked about another drug he put me on at the same time doing this, all he said was no (no light bulb went on that it could be this drug?

Words cannot describe how horrible it was. I was absolutely determined to get back on Xanax because what I was experiencing was simply intolerable. My doctor prescribed this and I was certain it wouldn’t work. The first day I felt jittery and cold. The second day I woke up and didn’t want to vomit. I thought it was too good to be true. There is no way an antihistamine could help my anxiety. However it is working. I feel great, I’m focused, confident, calm, alert, sleep well. It’s so weird, zero anxiety and clear as a bell.

Back to the ER and was prescribed 50mg of vistaril (took the 50mg as prescribed for 2 weeks) and I was completely out of my mind and experiencing multiple panic attacks a day and was in tears consistently. Vistaril put me in a really dark place. My eyelids began to swell and I started breaking out in a rash. I went to the ER again and they told me I wasn’t having an allergic reaction to the medication and that I should not discontinue the medication until seen by PCP. Ha! I immediately stopped taking it and have been of fit for 2 days and I feel as I’m withdrawing. So a total of 3 weeks I was severely depressed and it put me in a dark place.

To my surprise, when I woke up the next morning, I didn't have any anxiety or shakes at all! I didn't end up even taking the Zoloft, and I've been on hydroxyzine since then.

The only issues I've found is that on occasion some side effects like blurry vision and diarrhea get in the way. The biggest issue I've found with it Vistaril is that it usually makes me depressed and irritable later in the day or even the next day. I'd strongly suggest notifying loved ones that you've taken one, and need some space. Over all it's nice for in-the-moment relief, but has some nasty side effects.",Samuel

This stuff keeps me going through essentially everything my anxiety disorder throws at me. My heart rate goes through the roof during a panic attack, I get anxious, freak out, and my body spasms.

Once the drug is out of your system the sleepiness wears off, though. I use it for sleep because it helps me knock out when I'm restless in bed.Takes barely 15 minutes to go into effect completely once you've taken it, and it happens gradually.Best medicine I've been prescribed in my life.

49,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Anxiety,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 26, 2021",6,Hydroxizine works wonders for anxiety. It is even sometimes the drug they prescribe for anxiety with withdrawals from heroine and alcohol. I think it is important to know when looking at ratings for anxiety medications some of the bad reviews are people that are medication seeking. So anything other than benzos of course doesn't work for them. They don't want it to work. They want benzos. I know - I used to be one of them! I was taking four 1mg doses of lorazapam a day. Hydroxyzine 50 mg in the morning and 100 at night helped me get down to one 0.5mg lorazapam with a goal of taking  none! What people don't understand is the more you take benzos the more anxiety you have. Best of luck to you all.,leximsluxx

It’s safe in pregnancy and I really have found it to be entirely necessary in helping deal with the anxiety. I was also given buspirone (category B) which takes a while to get in your system. Meanwhile hydroxyzine has been a life saver for me. Very very necessary.,Songbird

I mean it definitely worked for me as far as anxiety goes for the first couple days. I took it and started feeling better about an hour later and my panic symptoms almost totally subsided. The more I took it though the more I started feeling its side effects. I would suffer from depression from time to time in the past, and around the 3 hour mark on this med I felt a wave of depression hit me. Soon after I went into an episode of derealization and felt completely disconnected from myself, completely numb iykyk I(if you know, you know). But like I said as far as anxiety, at least for me on 25mg, it worked really good. If you suffer from depression AND anxiety, and your anxiety and panic is controlling you at the moment, maybe just use this really short term.

The government has made it a hassle for doctors to prescribe benzos. They  will throw everything else at you despite side effects and lack of it actually working.  For persons with serious anxiety, buspar, visteral, lexapro do not work. I have tried them all. Benzos are a drug used in the treatment of anxiety for a decade and for most used safely.  It is  not the drug that is the problem they are safe and effective if used properly. As long as there are people wanting to abuse drugs there will be addiction problems.

What a difference to  my anxiety it doesn't interfere with mental thought process, just blunts the triggers of my anxiety.

213,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Anxiety,10.0,,"October 17, 2019",16,"After initially dismissing this drug a few years ago when I was still drinking heavily, I've now found that Hydroxyzine really does wonders for my intense anxiety and moodiness.  Along with tyrosine, GABA, theanine, and folic acid, it seems to really lift my mood and I feel very happy like the fun hypomania.  If I'm singing to music and talking a lot, I'm in a great mood and that's what this med does.  I'm bipolar 1 and my moodiness gets intense when I'm in a mixed state or bad mania.   I currently take 50 mg x 3 per day and I'm also on Trileptal 600 mg x 2 a day and Lamictal 200 mg per day for bipolar depression.  The Trileptal does great for capping my mania but it doesn't do it for my acute anxiety that leads to the moodiness.  Most people are not on anywhere near the dosage I'm at, like 10 - 25 mg or so.  But I'm 6 ft  240 pounds and I need a lot of every med I take to be effective.  ",Samurai Sam

I also take it with sertraline which is used for my depression. I’ve used it on several occasions both when I knew I would have a panic attack (night driving triggers it) or during a situation when I felt one coming on. When I took it during my panic attack, I honestly feel like it made the experience worse and more frightening. Maybe I need to take more than one at a time during an episode? However I did take one when I was feeling mildly anxious at work and within 20 minutes I was completely calmed down. No more racing thoughts, or fast heart beat.

My anxiety gives me insomnia so this helped with both that and panic attacks. Yes, at first it will knock you out so I recommend taking it before bed for a week or so to get your body used to it. If you're like me and get groggy after taking sleeping medicine the night before, make sure you're leaving yourself enough time in the morning to get ready for work if you have to. Eventually the tiredness feeling won't overpower you. I'm ranking it at 7/10 because since I taking it pretty much daily to help me sleep I've noticed an increase in nightmares. I never usually dream so the fact that 5 out or 7 nights a week are nightmares is strange and I believe it could be partly due to the hydroxyzine.

I've been on it for 3 days after having  it for 2 weeks and fighting  with myself about taking it. Take it. We are all different but it's worth a try.  It  saved my life and let me add when we feel this way we are seeking answers to our anxiety  which causes us to desperately find relief by reading something we wanna hear or whatever it takes. This is the hardest thing I've dealt with in my life but don't give up there is hope with this med and Citalopram and lots of exercise and prayer!!! Another thing guys this is how many reviews out of billions of people so don't lose hope. Best of luck Hugs and prayers!!!,Massagegirl 38

Where Ativan will work very quickly in 20-30 minutes tops and smother and separate you from the sensation of panic in your chest, with hydroxyzine it takes about 45 minutes and the way the anxiety slowly petering-out sort of creeps up on you. You have to be more patient which can be awful when you're panicking but the end result is nearly identical.",heartw0rms
