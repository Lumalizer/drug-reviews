Caused anorgasmia, my libido died, caused horrible sexual dysfunction just like SSRI's do. I became numb and apathetic, every day I was extremely irritable. I'm tapering down 7.5mg every 3 days and it's a horrible experience. Gained weight, anxiety didn't change, depression stayed about the same. I wish I never went on this trash.",Eva
1,Mirtazapine,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 30, 2022",1,"I was prescribed Remeron in May of 2021 & within 10 months I put on 33 pounds! I was having a steady decline in my weight before starting it. However, the medication does REALLY help with sleep. I was out within 30 mins of taking my dose at 9pm. I had no other side effects from what I could tell. It works very well but it isn’t worth the weight gain for me. Getting off of it now slowly & started a new medication that helps with weight loss.

2,Mirtazapine,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 24, 2022",1,"I’ve struggled with anxiety with OCD tendencies and agoraphobia since my early teens. I’ve been on a lot of medications, in Dec 2020 I was under a lot of stress and started taking Prozac which had helped me before. NOPE. One day I developed SEVERE anxiety that was like a panic attack for 2 weeks. I was taken off fluoxetine and put on 15mg mirtazapine. I was SOOO thankful, it knocked me out and by the next day I felt so much better. Unfortunately as months have gone on and stressors affect me, I’m experiencing pretty debilitating anxiety and OCD where I can’t function. I’m hoping upping my dose (I'm on 30mg now) will help, or combining it with another anxiolytic. It did initially increase my appetite and when my anxiety goes away in the evening I do like eating chocolate, but I struggle with low appetite caused by anxiety so this is a good thing for me.",mentholillness
3,Mirtazapine,Anxiety,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 12, 2022",2,"This drug initially saved me. I had fallen into a deep hole of anxiety, panic, depression with insomnia. With only 15 mg I truly felt like myself again. After a year on it I felt great, so I tapered off. Sadly, after 2 weeks off it, I experienced withdrawal/relapse. All the symptoms that made me go on it in the first place came back. But I don’t want to stay on any drug long term so I will power through and continue with CBT and exercise. Bottom line: this drug works. But be prepared to have a difficult time coming off it. So If you don’t want to stay on a drug long term, I wouldn’t recommend.",Memememe

7,Mirtazapine,Anxiety,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 22, 2022",2,"I absolutely want to stress the fact that every drug works differently from one person to another. I went on mirtazepine 15 mg last November for anxiety and depression. During the first week on the drug I felt more depressed but after around 12-15 days I started to feel better: good night sleeps, more appetite, more energy etc. but nothing exceptional, I mean, I was 50% better than before. After 4 months, I start to feel anxious again and I need to take Rivotril to function. Think I need to go to doctor for adjust dosage or changing medication.",Lord_PNK

9,Mirtazapine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 19, 2022",1,"I've been taking mirtazapine for longer than 7 years, so I think it is time for me to reduce from 30mg to 15mg and then a quarter of a tablet and then stop it. I can share my thoughts of it during all this time , obviously could be different for other people.This is a fantastic remedy for anxiety and it really helps, but what I've noticed in top of gaining a bit of weight is that you loose the sense of achievement (in the long term to progress in life, my example job wise) a bit unmotivated. I do believe it works for people who wants to do things on routine basis  and makes you not to be worried for whatever it comes in your way. It does give you lots of confidence but you also have to work out regularly at the gym due to the weight you gained, and to keep your self esteem in shape. Also affects a bit with your personal relationships (not professional) due to the fact not thinking much outta square. So keeping your brain in shape having a decent sleep least 7hrs and keep networking would be an advice .",mikeb
10,Mirtazapine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 19, 2022",12,"Mirtazapine saved my life. I have struggled with severe anxiety and depression for a few years now, and was previously on SSRI's, which seemed to make me a zombie + give me lots of unwanted side effects. I first tried Mirtazapine 15mg 3 years ago, after months of misery and no sleep. The first night I took it, I slept like a baby. The positive effects were almost immediate, and the medication worked wonders for me. It truly was my miracle medication. I woke up way less anxious, and within two weeks I was so relaxed, less depressed and I was getting all the sleep I needed and doing things again. Last month I upped my dose to 30mg as I wasn't getting the full effects of 15mg anymore, and thats helped me become way less groggy in the mornings, as I have way more energy. I find it's less ""sedating"" but more calming than 15mg. I had no side effects going up - I felt great and usually I react badly. This medication felt like my last hope and it changed my life. Please don't give up!!!",Lauren
11,Mirtazapine,Anxiety,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 15, 2022",1,"My GI specialist suggested Mirtazapine to assist with sleep and weight gain. I started at 15mg, slept amazingly (groggy next day); this continued for 10 days (I also had an appetite and gained weight). At day 11, I went back to normal. At day 18, I started feeling jittery, could not sleep, had visual disturbances, bad tremors and felt like lashing out at people; it was scary. I continued for few more days, no improvement so decided to stop. It was Xmas so I could not get med assistance and I decided to taper on my own. I had only been on med for 3.5 weeks so I dropped to 7.5mg for 5 days, then 3.75 for few more. I had horrible withdrawal symptoms: restless, agitated, shaking, no sleep. This lasted for 10 days and then my GP told me to go back on 7.5mg to assist with more weight gain. As soon as I started, I felt better but it gave me panic sleep. I continued for 10 days, then tapered off properly. 1 week after stopping, I have withdrawals, but less intense. If you stop, taper properly!",CathyS

Initially you may feel a little hungover in the morning and not be able to gather your thoughts, but stick with it - this wears off after a week or two. It doesn’t affect my sex drive and I feel my best when I’m on it and I’ve tried most things over the years!

I have tried a few different antidepressants over the years (sertraline, venaflaxine and Citalopram) these just did not agree with me at all, made my panic 100% worse. The doctor then mentioned mirtazapine. Let me tell you something, for the last 7 years of my life I have not been me. I have been extremely depressed, suicidal, could not cope in my own head any more. I would avoid going to places , it broke down my relationships with friends , partners and work. I have now been on mirtazapine 15mg for just over a week. I noticed a huge change from the first dose  I finally felt like myself again. No panic, I feel calm through out the day, boost my mood and I am smiling enjoying life again, something I have not done in 7 years.Please do not let the negative reviews put you off, this saved my life and could save yours too.

14,Mirtazapine,Anxiety,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 17, 2022",2,"So I started taking because I had some pretty serious side effects with other anti depressants, I was hopeful reading the reviews, I’m 1 month into taking 15 mg. First two weeks I had what they called ‘the remeron hang over’ in the mornings until about noon where I wouldn’t feel real and I’d get extremely depressed. I tried to stick it out though because by afternoon I felt fantastic. I still get dry eyes and eye pain pretty regularly which is only mildly annoying. Another thing I’ve noticed is I’ve become highly irritable on this. I have other diagnosises though and it’s been recommended I take other medications in conjunction to this. This has not been very effective for me though. It’s brought my anxiety and panic down from a constant 10 to a 5 so there’s something to be said for that but I still feel it could work better. So I give this medication 3 stars, the limited side effects is why I rate it so highly but it’s not the most effective thing I’ve taken.",Eve

It worked soon as the first dose, its now month 2, sadly theres only 1 side effect getting in the way, ( acne ) can no longer continue the medication, but I'm very prone to it anyway. To whoever is thinking about using the medication I certainly recommend it. Its brilliant! I will now be looking else where for something else that works similar to this but with no acne side effect, but overall this for anxiety especially is awesome, reduced by 80%.

I've got to say it's been hard make, makes me feel drowsy brain zaps and a bit out of it, but helped so much with my depression and mood I now get up look after myself and even able to take my little one to school now.  It has been  a long road but feel it's given me some light. My anxiety is still playing up but  I take diazepam too. I do get pains in my legs and arms every now and then.

But with Remeron, I'm just a little hungrier...which is actually good because I have gastritis. I'm not tired...that wore off after the first week.

21,Mirtazapine,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 23, 2021",9,I was prescribed 15mg of mirtazapine for depression and anxiety as well as insomnia. A lot of people take it one night and quit because it does leave you very tired the next day at first. This goes away after a week or so as your body adjusts to it. I continued taking it for a year and it proved to be quite effective for insomnia. It definitely helped me get through some really tough times last year. Now that I’m in a better place and not having panic attacks every day I have begun tapering by 3.75mg at a time (quarter of a dose) with no unpleasant side effects so far. Overall I’d say it was a very helpful drug but I don’t want to remain on it forever due to the noticeable appetite increase. After being on it a year I still get very hungry during the day even after full meals. If you have insomnia or anxiety or depression I think you should give it a try!,Devonian

25,Mirtazapine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2021",3,"Every body is different as they say,  and my body is racked with panic disorder. I'm not going to say this is a bad drug,  but it has a property that some people should be aware of.  I kind of stumbled into mirtazapine because I read it had mild side effects that includes eating a lot (good)  and sleeping a lot (good), which sounded like a welcome change to me. But I would just say that for those with panic disorder,  I'm fairly convinced now that it's not good to stimulate the nervous system the way mirtazapine does. It's probably great for people with depression though.  Mirtazapine strengthens the sympathetic nervous system,  which is responsible for the fight or flight response. So,  I'm going back to lexapro,  which worked for years.  All the tricyclic antidepressants and snri's stimulate the nervous system a lot,  and after a year of going through a bunch of these, I haven't had a descent nights sleep the whole time. Mirtazapine kept me up at night and I still can't eat much.",Markeric

Yes, it works well as a sleep aid and helped me to gain the vast amount of weight I’d lost, but I’ve felt the lowest I’ve ever felt on this med.

I was prescribed it for sleep and anxiety, hoping aiding the sleep would help the anxiety. 15mg did nothing. 30mg worked wonders for sleep and I stuck on it for around 10 months. Did nothing to reduce anxiety, in fact anxiety increased, not saying mirtazapine caused it though as I wouldn't know.  Then I was put on 45mg, which made me feel unbelievably low, made me realise I definitely do not have depression, it took away my soul within days, 45mg made me feel that way. Back on 30mg but kinda plodding along. Catch 22 now, I don't want to have anxiety and sleepless nights, so I will stick with it for now as it is working for people struggling to get to sleep and stay asleep, no longer waking at 3am and getting up for the day.

Thats where I was started on Mirtazapine. When I first started it, I had such bizarre dreams, but had the best sleep I had had in over a year. Because of the medications sedative affect, it did calm me, and helped me to sleep, which was exactly what I  needed. Once I was able to sleep, it was easier for me to deal with the anxiety attacks - which were not as severe after that.

Some days I have them, but it’s like I can feel them twitching but they can’t raise their ugly head. It’s a wonder medication for me. Helpedme so much. All whilst managing a hectic life and managing my own hectic brain. I cannot recommend it enough. I’ve had no side effects at all. I vivid dream at night now, before I couldn’t even sleep, because I would have panic attacks in bed. I wouldn’t sleep for days at a time. It’s amazing for me.",Dt1807

For me the side effects were strong hunger cravings that turned into pain if I didn’t eat. I gained weight fast, 30kg in 2 years. I came off them 8 weeks ago because I couldn’t see myself being alive in a few years time if I kept gaining weight that fast. That’s with me exercising and burning 600ish calories every day. Since I’ve been off them I’ve had non-stop stomach issues. I’m woken up every morning about 5 hours after going to bed by stomach pains, and can’t get back to sleep due to hunger. Stomach pressure, pains, nausea and vomiting, acid reflux are all problems I have on a daily basis. I had no pre-existing medical conditions before being on Mirtazapine (besides anxiety), now I’m waiting on tests to see what I’ve developed. My advice is to ensure that you know the damage these things might do to you. You might be ok, or you might not.",MrA

I once was someone hastily looking up reviews for mirtazapine because I was stuck in a completely anxious rut and a different drug wasn’t working as fast as I wanted it to (citalopram). My doctor suggested this because 1) honestly was an anxious mess and 2) I had lost a huge amount of weight from anxiety/loss of appetite. I went on this and it really, really helped me. My anxiety is a lot less than it has been and I’m able to work through it better. I've also gotten back to a healthy weight. I've been on mirtazapine for over a year now, and it has worked wonders for me. I decided to write a review because I was once that person frantically scrolling looking at reviews to determine if my meds would really help and the positive comments ease some of my worries.

I have been on it for 7 weeks so far; the first two at 15 mg per day and the last five @ 30 mg. Before that I was on Sertraline and before that, Venlafaxine. Neither worked for the anxiety/depression I was suffering. With mirtazapine,  I saw improvement from day 1: I slept better and the anxiety started to diminish. After three weeks I actually wanted to do the things (such as meet other people socially) that previously I avoided. The downside initially was that I felt very tired/groggy for the first few days although this improved rapidly. My appetite increased significantly and I have gained 10 pounds which I am now trying to address with a stricter control of my diet and more exercise. From reading other reviews, I am a little concerned about the long term: whether this medication will stop working and/or the problems to be faced when trying to get off it.

If I can stay awake at all I am far too groggy to function at anything close to a normal level. Work and everyday events are impossible. Driving is out of the question. Even walking around is a challenge at times. A long-time friend asks if I'm drunk when he sees me ( I suspect he's only 1/2 joking).There is no way I'll be able to continue taking this for much longer with this level of impairment. I can't find a job that allows random 6 hr naps so unless these effects disappear very soon I am no longer going to be employed. Did I mention the munchies?

I still get quite irritable sometimes and use ativan to help me relax occasionally. Overall I think it's a really great drug and has probably helped me more than I can realise.

I'm considering even asking the doctor to increase the dosage to 30 mg next time I see her. Usually I am very sensitive to any brain stimulus from herbal to pharmaceutical. But this medication really helped me a lot in this short period of time. I was scared at 1st to take it considering all the side effects that people talk about but except 1st a couple of days feeling extra drowsy or sleepy I have had no major side effects to make me stop or even consider stopping this medication.

54,Mirtazapine,Anxiety,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 7, 2021",1,"Mirtazapine has been a double edge sword for me. When I first started taking it 18 months ago I experienced its sedating effects and it was great for falling asleep. It also gave me a ravenous appetite and I put on the pounds. What I did not realize is that its activating quality caused panic, anxiety and agitation during the day. It has become a circular nightmare where I look forward to taking it at night to relax. I did not know it was causing day time agitation as I was coming off clonazapam for several months and attributed it the benzo. I feel like I am addicted to the Mirtazapine and fear that if I do not take it I will be unable to fall asleep. I was originally on 30mg but I have managed to cut back to 7.5 mg and it is my goal to get off this horrible medication. It also causes me to have irrational fear…..It is my guess that it is activating the fight or flight centre in the primitive brain.

83,Mirtazapine,Anxiety,2.0,,"March 30, 2021",5,"I would HIGHLY suggest you read through the side effect list that has been compiled under CONTROLLED conditions. That being said, take these reviews with caution. Here is MY experience with the drug. Took 15 mg for severe anxiety and mild depression PROS : Increased appetite, lowered stomach pain, aaaaand that’s it, honestly. CONS : so, so, so tired. Even after 2 months my body never adjusted. Felt winded just being awake. It sucked. Slept 10-12 hours on average and tbh could have slept even more. Also speaking of sleep, the nightmares I got from this were almost traumatizing. They were hyper-real and profoundly disturbing. I’d wake up afraid to go back to bed. Anyway, it just did more damage than good. I still suffer from the nightmares. P.s don’t read too much into these reviews when it comes to weight gain. Again, under carefully monitored and controlled studies the % chance you WON'T gain weight is 86%.

I not getting better day 6 of stay Dr. gave 15 mg of Remeron for sleep and my appetite was back. I woke up in morning 100% better, groggy but no anxiety which was incredible. At home I started reading comments about mirtazapine looked at the necessity of taking a full dose as unnecessary. It has been an up/down few months tried Celexa, Effexor, Lexapro, and with me taking a very minimal amount of mirtazapine at night which does help me sleep wonderfully... but my anxiety is awful.

They gave me mirtazapine and I was wiped out that night. For the first month I really struggled with the side effects and wanted to stop.. 2 years passed and I must say, I can sleep, I am a calmer person who can make wise decisions.

I was sleeping less than 2 hours a night - my anxiety was escalating and my mood was plummeting at an alarming rate. Mirtazapine stopped my breakdown in its tracks! I took 1 x 15mg tablet & slept through the night for the first time in months. I woke up feeling 40% better but I was sedated until midday - this faded over the next few weeks. I had a big appetite for the first  month but that eased off. I started exercising again which was a result of both my boosted mood and energy levels. The sedation still stays with my until 10 or 11am but my quality of life has improved so much!!! I've put on 5lbs but I had lost half a stone. You have to weigh up the pros & cons. I'd rather have more of an appetite than be unable to eat because I'm shaking with unbearable anxiety.

My appetite is a lot better, during these 3 months I have gained around 4kg. I never have bad eating days now so I eat regularly.About my sleeping habits: I've always been a night owl. Nowadays, if I take it around 8 PM, then I am asleep by 11:30. On the weekends I wake up around 8-10 AM on my own. I don't feel tired throughout the day.",Julia

After suffering from anxiety and panic attacks I finally went to doctors and was prescribed antidepressants - I think they were citalopram not sure of name but they made me worse. I was then prescribed mirtazapine they took a good few weeks to kick in. I've been taking 15mg for nearly 2 years now and feel miles better in myself. I am now able to go to the shops on my own, get a bus alone and even got a full time job.  Here comes the down side, I've put a stone and a half on gone from 9 and half to 11.  The actual drug doesn't make you gain weight it's the food you crave.  So I'm determined to try and combat that with a healthier diet.

It was like something took over my body. I could eat a large pizza and a box of cupcakes, almost cry because I didn’t want to eat anymore and knew I was out of control, and then 10 minutes later be in the kitchen tearing through the kids’ cereal and whatever else I could get my hands on.

I did not experience any drowsiness issues anymore. I was able to sleep at any time for 8-10 hours straight, after 6 night shifts in a row, no problem whatsoever resuming the normal day rhythm. Simply amazing. Mirtazapine helped a little with my depression, but it did nothing for my anxiety. I stopped it after 6 months after getting off the shift work and did not experience any problems. I did gain about 8 kg while on mirtazapine, which I lost within 2 months after stopping it. I’m now on sertraline, which did wonders for my anxiety and depression.",Roger

173,Mirtazapine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 9, 2019",12,"I've been taking Mirtazapine for over a year now.  My doctor prescribed it to boost my appetite. I have  Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. I've been underweight almost my whole life.  Always wanted to gain weight, but I get stomachaches if I eat too much.  Just don't enjoy eating the way many people do.  And stress or if I have any reason to be nervous - that makes it even harder to eat.  Anyway, I've found this medicine helps a lot.  I take probably 1-2 mg (tiny pieces of my 15mg pill) once a week.  I have been able to gain weight, and whenever I fall into the rut of not knowing what to eat (for days on end), this boosts my appetite enough to pull me out of that spot.  It also helps with my anxiety.  It does dry my sinuses significantly, but I just run a humidifier in my room at night and that fixes the dry-sinus issue.",Marie

Ok it did help with sleep but the lack of energy was outweighing the benefits. Plus I gained so much weight in such a short time as I was craving food despite only eating in the evening. It was like I had no control so I stopped the medication and within 10 days the fog has lifted and weight is slowly coming off. I'm now on 60mg of cymbalta and await the outcome.

I went from having 5+ panic attacks from severe GAD that landed me in a stabilization unit where I was put on Mirtazapine 7.5mg. The first few days all I wanted to do was sleep. But I noticed increased appetite and elevation of my mood the very first day and no panic attacks. I also have MDD. I am super sensitive to medication so over a month I went up to 15mg. The drowsiness wore off after about 3 weeks. I have had no other side effects. This is the only medication that has worked for me after after trying 8 different ones. SSRIs and SNRIs and Atypicals caused too many side effects for me. So thankful to have this. Stick through the drowsiness. It is worth the brighter days.,AnxietyQueen

But I did my research!My fear was weight gain, it almost stopped me from trying it. However, I came across research regarding how mirtazapine crashes your cortisol (which is why it works so well). Apparently, this is what causes the carb cravings. So, I dropped the carbs. It was a tough 2 weeks, but RESULT! Zero craving and rather than gaining weight, I am loosing. I gained three stones on the Cit, so that's even better news. I thought that I had to choose between being fat and happy or thin and crazy. Instead, my choice is between carbohydrates or protein. It's important to make sure to get good a multivitamin that includes minerals. Also, eat plenty of green leafy veg (after transition). But apart from that, which is NOTHING compared to cravings, weight gain or coming off meds, it's a small price to pay. Do your research, it's a total game changer!",Tweet

After pushing-through those first few days I am glad I kept taking it; my mood has balanced-out and overall I have a much better quality of life. I gained 15kg easily in the first few months of taking this, and it is difficult to keep the weight down. I crave things like donuts and cookies while taking this, it’s weird but it’s true. Unless you are very disciplined, you may have some tummy fat while taking this. After taking this for 2 years now the morning hangover effect has more-or-less gone; it is best to have early nights while on this.

I'm eating half of what I ate while taking it, working out more, and my weight is not budging. I am worried this has slowed down my metabolism long term, because before taking this drug if I got my diet and exercise right the weight would fall off rapidly. Coming off of it I could not sleep much at all, so I turned to melatonin supplements and they worked almost just as well for sleep without negative side effects. I also still get headaches every day since being off of it, something that I didn't have much of a problem with before.

All I can say is I slept really well but continued to feel sluggish and tired during the day. Took 2nd one last night before bed. Woke and had cuppa around 7.30 then slept till 9.30. Got up has cereal and figured I was still sleepy so went back to bed. I didn't wake until 1.30!!! Surely this cannot be normal. Is it? I'm scared to keep going with them if I'm going to end up sleeping the days away. Any advice? Anybody experienced same/similar at very start?",Choccychops
214,Mirtazapine,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 13, 2019",15,I started Remeron at 15mg and 150mg of Zoloft (btw I’m 18). I had major anxiety and panic attack disorder in a result to this I wasn’t eating and lost 35 pounds. I became depressed and I couldn’t sleep. So I gave remeron a shot this helped with eating (I gained all the weight back and more) but this didn’t really help with sleeping because I have major insomnia. If your curious to what it feels like when you take remeron (or if I get nervous to how this would make your feel) it’s like taking  Benadryl. Be aware that after a couple of days you’ll feel tired and most likely sleep in. I hope this helps you! I wish you the best of luck.,Angelina

The only side effects I found was in the first 2 weeks brain zapping and drowsiness/ clumsiness. Interestingly this drug took immediate affect for me after day one in taking it. You could attribute this to a placebo effect, however this significant improvement in reducing my overwhelming anxiety continued throughout me taking it. I was on 15mg and that was enough for me. Also another side effect I had for around the first 1.5 months was increased appetite I could eat and eat and eat and I would still feel like I could continue eating. There wasn’t a point that I knew that I was satiated.  At around 3 months I started to feel like my anxiety levels were normalising I began to feel more like myself and could see through the mist. I had no withdrawal symptoms when I weaned off of them.Anyone suffering from depression complicated by anxiety and sleep issues I would highly recommended based on my experience.",Person 1

I was pleasantly surprised to see the only thing that happened was my anger & anxiety calmed down, sleep was great, and my sex drive is awesome. Hubby is happy too, lol.

You will have weight gain and hunger cravings. As for helping me with anxiety & depression I didn’t see much improvement. It did help with sleep. I came off of it because I felt handcuffed to it. I felt once I took it at night I couldn’t do anything like go get a drink with friends or attend a concert because the sleeping affects are that powerful.,Manny

265,Mirtazapine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 5, 2018",23,I don't know where to start. I suggest you start at the end if you are considering this drug. Do as much research as you can.  17 months into withdrawal and no end in sight. If you take one you may not want to stop because you might just feel amazing. Really really amazing. The end is different. Very different. With the correct nutrition and exercise your body is coded to heal itself.  Withdrawal stories are real. So is the paucity of response to others in withdrawal calling out for anyone who might have made it out the other side. Two people I know didn't. Please be sure before you take this. Sure that you have researched what the end looks like from patients testimonies on withdrawal. The middle might not be so enticing either. But the start. Wow!,J

Feels like I will faint often, body tremors, lethargic, panic attacks... And I have social phobia as well. I have tried a lot of med for the past 20 years. Now I'm taking 1 mg of clonazepam at 10 am and 0.5 mg before bedtime with 30 mg of mirtazapine. Mirtazapine is a very strong drug. I started with 1/4 of the lowest dose and it knocked me out right away. I like it because it helps a lot with my insomnia. Once you pass the side effects it's not too bad. But I wouldn't take it during the day as I find it hard to think after taking a dose. The mornings are rough. Feels like a bad hangover. But so far it's the best combo for me.

I was prescribed this after being unable to tolerate SSRI anti depressants and having a very bad reaction to Lexapro. Mirtazapine has worked well for insomnia and I started noticing improvements in anxiety levels and mood within 3-4 wks of starting.  I initially had a mild increase in appetite but no weight gain, and my appetite is now normal. The drawback to this med is daytime fatigue/groggy sensation that does not lift until late afternoon. I was told this would improve with time, but it has not.

Sleep like a baby, wake up refreshed and energy levels have risen, feel so happy, not feeling high or anything, just seem to feel normal, which I haven't felt in 10 years, only kind of downside is that I can't stop eating! And not sugars and carbs! I eat almost anything that is available to me, if there is only a bag of salad in the fridge I will eat the whole thing! The last time I had an appetite like this I was a very active teenager. I've already gained half a stone in 2 weeks and I was 11 stone to start with.

I could not be happier! The nausea was better the first day after taking it, and within two or three days was totally gone. I finally have my appetite back, too.

Wow, HUGE increase in anxiety and a full on panic attack. No previous psych history before this. Had to stop after 3 doses. Once I settled down tried some mirtazapine at low dose (7.5 mg). Now we're talking! Almost immediate relief of anxiety and no side effects at all!Here's a tip. Mirtazapine can be very sedating in some due to its anti-histamine effect. 1st try 50 mg of Benadryl in the daytime on a day you can afford to crash if needed. If the Benadryl zonks you avoid mirtazapine; if you aren't too sedated it is worth a try.",Anonymous
