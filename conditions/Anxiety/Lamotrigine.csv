0,Lamotrigine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 22, 2022",0,Game changer/Life saver! Thyroid issues mimicking depression/anxiety through my life. Tried various SSRI’s for last 20 years. Finally being diagnosing hyperthyroidism which explained the anxiety and then radioactive Iodine made me Hypothyroid. Taking Synthroid now for life. Thyroid flares/unbalance made anxiety/depression beyond bearable. November 2017- I checked into a psych hospital because I need a comprehensive safe place. No shocker but my THS number( thyroid) was off the charts. . . This is where I was first given Lamictal. The last five years has been my longest episode free period. I use Lamictal along with Cymbalta and Prozac. I highly recommend trying Lamictal for reoccurring crippling anxiety/depression.,Loki 5
1,Lamotrigine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2022",2,"I was on Lexapro for years when I decided to step off. The process was slow and difficult, and I experienced brain zaps and other scary side effects. About a year later I had a severe mental breakdown and ended up in a crisis center. I was completely hopeless. Frightened. And experienced a primal fear. A fear you get when being chased by a wild animal. I saw a psych and she started me on Lamotrigine - and slowly went up over the course of three months to 200 mgs. I am four months into this medication and am so proud to say that I haven’t had a panic attack in a month. Not long ago I had them every single day. I experienced none of the side effects that SSRI’s gave me and I feel like I’m getting control of my life back. I’m so happy I gave medication another try. There is no shame in taking meds. You deserve to feel your best and love this one life we have to the fullest.",Sally
2,Lamotrigine,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 1, 2022",2,"Back in December I was diagnosed with situational anxiety and depression. This was the first time I’ve ever experienced anything like this so I was terrified. I thought I was going crazy, had intrusive thoughts, couldn’t sleep, etc. I was started on generic lexapro 10mg and generic buspar 7.5mg three times a day. After 7 weeks on lexapro and an increase to 15mg,I felt it really wasn’t helping. I decreased to 10mg which helped a little but I still wasn’t feeling much better. I was started five days ago on lamotrigine 25mg for the first two weeks then will increase to 50mg. Now I really don’t want to jinx it, but this has help me so so much. While I don’t feel a 100% back to myself, I feel like I’m on the way there. My anxiety and depression have decreased as have the intrusive thoughts, and I’m starting to feel like myself more and more. I recommend if you can’t seem to find something that works for you",Rmpass

4,Lamotrigine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 2, 2022",2,"I was feeling a bit overwhelmed at work as I had discontinued my antidepressants (with permission of my prescriber) for over 6 months. I really didn't want to go back to the same prescriber so I opted for an app service. They prescribed lamotrigine as a mood stabilizer. The first two days on this medication I felt worst than I had ever felt in my life. Suicidal thoughts just popped out of nowhere. It was really scary. I felt so depressed and in emotional pain and hopeless. I couldn't sleep. If I slept, I had vivid dreams and night sweats. I told the prescriber and they said side effects should wean in 5 days. So, I continued taking lamotrigine for about a month. The suicidal thoughts kinda went away and the impending doom feeling on the pit of my stomach got better. However, I had horrible headaches, vivid dreams every night and insomnia. The anxiety was constant and worse than before I started taking lamotrigine and this was only 25mg a day. I finally stopped taking it altogether.",anxiousmess

I’ve been taking it for 4 years now and it’s amazing how much my mood has stabilized. I’ve never had a side effect and can still feel a range of emotions. Paired with gabapentin, my anxiety is finally manageable (almost to the point of non-existent). I feel like I can live life again and have no idea how I functioned on a daily basis before it.",A.m

I started at 50mg and then increased it to 100mg. So far I feel like the weight off the world has been lifted off my shoulders. I can be excited about life again and do more things with my day.

9,Lamotrigine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 23, 2021",4,"My daughter who suffers from BPD was put on lamotrigine last June which I wasn’t happy about. She’s suffered from self harm in the past but since taking lamotrigine, she’s self-harmed really badly and took two overdoses which she’s never done in her life. I persuaded the psychiatrist to take her off them. In the month of withdrawal from this drug, it’s been terrible and she actually  planned to take her own life last week. She had to go to a recovery house to keep her safe. It states that this drug can cause suicide ideation in the under 25s. It is horrifying and terrifying that this drug can genuinely cause this in some people. For others, it can work well for them. I feel that this medication has very nearly killed my daughter.",Celticgirl

I was on Venlafaxine and Mirtazapine. Lamotrigine was added - I had no hope's of improvement but  from day one I started to improve. It has now been 6 months and I feel fine. I take 25mg twice a day.

12,Lamotrigine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 26, 2021",8,"I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression at 19. I saw a psych who gave me SSRI's and have been on  them most of my life.     Fast forward 45 yearsRecently had a panic attack so severe that I was on the verge of a stroke. I immediately saw a psych who told me I had been misdiagnosed all those years and that in fact I was Bipolar 2. He prescribed Lamictal 25 mg. The first 2 days I felt like I was in a fog and a little bit nauseated. Called my Dr and he recommended taking it at night. What a difference! He slowly weaned me off Celexa and Buspar and slowly increased the Lamictal. I am now stable on 100mg at night. No weight gain, and I'm back in the gym weight training. No more panic attacks. I'm a bit more emotional but I think it's situational as I just lost my dad 4 months ago. I highly recommend it!",Bella
13,Lamotrigine,Anxiety,9.0,,"September 8, 2021",2,"I had tried Zoloft to cope with some really sad things that happens and had a very severe adverse reaction. Before Zoloft I’d never really had anxiety. But Zoloft gave me panic attacks, insomnia (like sleeping 0-2 hours per night for weeks) and suicidal thoughts. I eventually developed sleep anxiety which is awful. I stopped the Zoloft  and did sleep therapy, and regular therapy. I was feeling good but I still had some of that intense anxiety.  I was TERRIFIED to try another drug after my experience with Zoloft but lamotrigine has helped me enormously. I’m only on 7.5 (yes 7.5, not 75mgs) and it’s made a big difference. Going up to 10mgs.  I had almost no side effects. The first 7 days I had a mild sleep disturbance and some very bizarre dreams but that was short lived and very mild. Currently experience no side effects, except occasionally feeling a bit slowed down, which is not a bad thing.",Nelliemell
14,Lamotrigine,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 13, 2021",1,"Been taking this med for depression, anxiety and BPD.  While it is not a miracle drug that will solve the issues completely it will help calm your mind and help with mood swings.  I don't always realize how much it helps until I stop taking it for a few days.   It's at least worth a try if you suffer from similar issues.   It helps keep me stable enough to focus on counseling which is a necessity.  Medication alone will not get me where I want to be in life.",Steve
15,Lamotrigine,Anxiety,9.0,,"August 5, 2021",11,"After a series of bad events ( long haul covid, bad experience with Lexapro, trauma and bad experiences with weed), Lamotrigine l has been my saving grace. I was suffering from panic attacks and mental break-downs. I could not find pleasure in anything or even go to work I was completely non functional. Lexapro just escalated this feeling and made me suicidal, it is a ""fit all"" drug that just made me so much worse. It is now my third week on Lamotrigine and the panic has calmed. I still get anxiety but these thoughts are not all-consuming. Almost no days stuck in bed with dark thoughts. I am able to face daily challenges now without absolutely crumbling.  I am now on 50mg and considering going up only because the improvement has been great. In my opinion this drug is much more effective than SSRI'S, it simply cuts out the extra brain-activity and lets your mind rest enough to start enjoying life again :)) It does get better and give Lamotrigine a try!!",v

Again I worried can SSRI  be restarted? Will I respond again? At times clonazepam helps to relieve anxiety not depression.  Then after going through literature I started lamotrigine 100 mg twice daily. I had intense rash on 3 rd day but mood was fully stabilised. I had vivid dreams too. I was thinking how to get rid of skin rash that covered my abdomen only. I have taken cetrizine after which it subsided. Lamotrigine is a good mood stabiliser and the doctor does not permits me to stop lamotrigine, but skin rash is problem but settled with antihistamines that I  am on.

29,Lamotrigine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 10, 2020",137,"I have taken lamotrigine for years with no side effects. It takes approximately 1.5-2 months for lamotrigine to take full effect. Side effects are typically avoided by starting at very low doses (I started at 25 mg once a day) and slowly increasing the dose over time. Taking higher doses too rapidly or without physician consultation increases risks of side effects, and you shouldn't expect to see full results within a couple days or even a couple weeks. I hope this helps someone feel less anxious about trying out this medication and feel more informed! (I am educated on this topic because I'm an MD student.)",k

I was struggling with anxiety, panic attacks, depression and PMMD. I was facing constant intrusive thoughts about death and sadness.I came home from the doctors after being prescribed and read these reviews and bawled my eyes out. I was so afraid of taking this medication. Yet, I needed something to help ASAP. I have now been taking lamotrigine for 3 months and my anxiety is much lower, my emotions are not out of control before my period and I have more peace of mind. I don’t have any bad side affects. My biggest recommendation is to start with a low dose (50mg) and after two weeks (100mg). I feel like taking more than this ups your chance of having a bad reaction.

Not euphoric, or like a different person, just... Normal! Calm, collected, but still sharp.Lamictal was like a valve that drained my anger out when I was just about full of rage.I personally haven't noticed many side effects, at least none that I don't already have from SSRIs. Loss of coordination is a big one and I only get tremors if I haven't eaten but that might just be low blood sugar.In conclusion, being someone who suffers from chronic general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder, I can definitely see Lamictal being an effective long term medication.

No, they were made much worse by lamotrigine. I thought so though one doctor said not. I have cut down very gradually to 25mgs from 200mg (taken about a year) and the withdrawal has been horrible once at about 50 to 75- exhaustion, anxiety and bad gut aches and obsessive thoughts. Almost as bad as SSRI withdrawal. So I am eventually stopping altogether. I have now tried virtually every mood disorder/anxiety/depression med so will just have to use much more cognitive techniques. I also take inderal and clonazepam (.5 once a day). I know I am addicted to clonazepam but I feel I have little choice given that my anxiety was very severe leading to inability to work at all. I'm sure that lamotrigine helps many people .

Do not listen to outsiders who do not understand how you feel. Medication is a personal option that you should feel no judgment about. If it helps you then that’s all that matters!
