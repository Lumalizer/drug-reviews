0,Valium,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 13, 2022",2,"My anxiety takes the form of aggression & destruction. Valium has been the only medication to level me out & keep me from acting out. I don’t take it every day but without it, I have no doubt I would be in very serious shape. It has been a godsend to me, and after 6 years I’m still on 5 mg. as needed. No dosage increase has been necessary.",Kevin T.

2,Valium,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 17, 2021",7,"I don’t understand why this wonderful drug is now being demonised. This drug and other benzos have helped me no end. These drugs are super important to lots of people especially in these COVID times. If a drug helps me have a better more normal life it should be my right to have this drug as it’s my body, just like if someone wants to lend there body to science or donate that’s fine why should this be no different. Doctors took an oath anxiety is at an all time high due to pandemic I feel it’s needed more than ever. Not just mother’s little helper anymore but fathers, sons and daughters alike.",Boycey
3,Valium,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 16, 2021",4,"For my panic disorder I used to take short-acting benzos i.e, Ativan which, of course, works; however, dependence and subsequent painful withdrawal followed hours after discontinuation. I am able to take Valium which is a long-acting benzo that seems (for me) a slower onset of action and a much longer duration of action. I notice that I'm able to start/stop the medication without experiencing withdrawal symptoms like I had with Ativan. Sometimes, can go weeks even months without a need to take. I use 2 MG, works great, have never needed more, in fact, sometimes I break the pill in half and only take 1 MG. The drug certainly can be abused, but I do feel it gets a bad rap. As always, this medication isn't for everyone and shouldn't be used by everyone.",Robimat1
4,Valium,Anxiety,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2021",1,"This drug was rubbish. They gave me this in the hospital today after telling me they gave me Ativan but gave me this garbage instead. It calmed my anxiety down, yeah, but I started feeling insanely sleepy, detached from reality, angry, and not like myself. This was my very first time taking it, won’t take it ever again. Ativan is the BEST benzodiazepine out there, hands down never disappoints me. I was acting all weird, paranoid, saying weird things, and MORE anxious. I took an Ativan for that several hours later I much prefer that drug over anything else. Never again 2/10.",Cyan
5,Valium,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 17, 2021",1,"I originally had this prescribed as I was coming off antidepressants. I only took it on days my mood swings were severely debilitating. I kept having it prescribed for moments I felt I was suffering with irritability or anxiety. It was helpful, and certainly beneficial for major events where I woke up with panic attacks after 3 hours broken sleep. It has been a saviour but gradually became a substance I easily turned to when things got hectic to the point I was using my inner resources and ability to sit with pain less efficiently.I eventually developed a tolerance and binged periodically. I changed my perspective and labelled the situation for what it was and decided to go sober. I'm managing fine and had no physical withdrawals, but the psychological addiction of valium is real. And doctors aren't going to monitor properly, I just hope others who have less experience with addiction can see whats going on if they experience this and trust their own judgement.",Grm

7,Valium,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 13, 2021",0,"I’ve been on 2.5 mg at bedtime nightly for 9 months. I love it, it’s changed my life (I’m 73) and made my extremely high blood pressure (in addition with blood pressure pills) go down to normal. I feel calm and would like to stay on it. I never feel like I need more.  I also take Omeprazole acid reflux medication. 4 1/2 months I started having bad hunger pains, would eat a big meal but the pain stayed. Each spring and fall I’ve always had an acid reflux flare up for a few weeks then it goes back to normal. It’s now fall and here we go again, but this time it seems worse. I’ve read that taking Omeprazole and Diazepam can be a moderate problem with breathing problems (which I don’t have) and it says nothing about affecting Gerd. But it does say Diazepam can possibly cause nausea and heartburn. Have any of you taking Diazepam experienced Gerd symptoms (bloated stomach, burning stomach up into your esophagus and throat)",JPK
8,Valium,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 31, 2021",1,"I've used this medication in the past, like about 3 years ago or so. I took it for about 7 months and tapered it off successfully. Well, I guess due to the stress of everything catching up, I find the need to appeal to it's benefits again, as I look forward to this need being very short termed. It does work great, it's amazing. I don't like to take any medications and really thought about this, trying to just overcome the need and praying for help. Well, sometimes you need some help, so why resist feeling so bad when this is out there to help you feel better. I suggest to speak to your doctor and go from there. I suggest a very low dose on an as needed basis and monitor how you feel going forward. Well, this is what I have to share and wish everyone the very best.",Anonymous
9,Valium,Anxiety,10.0,,"June 21, 2021",10,"Always had a nervous feeling in my stomach since I was a kid.  It carried on to my teens.  Tried all antidepressants and had horrid side effects. In my 20s and early 30s.   I'm now 40 I suffered a breakdown, wouldn't see friends work etc. Eventually my doc reluctantly put me on one 5mg Valium a day. I'm now working. Have my friends back and go out.  Feel positive. Been taking the docs script along side the blues.  I'm on nearly 100mg a day, it also helps with pain after an accident on my back.  Been on 50mg-100mg sometimes more for 10 years now.  I would not be here if I'd not managed to seek help and get valium.  Either that I'd have taken up drugs instead, weed.

10,Valium,Anxiety,7.0,,"June 7, 2021",6,"My weight is roughly 68 kg and I started with 5mg of this drug. I never required more than 5 mg (half a pill) because it already has a strong effect on me. It instantly relaxes me and takes away the anxiety. As an example, during a panic attack I felt like I was going to die and that nothing would ever be okay again, and just 2 minutes after chewing (not swallowing whole, that would have taken too long, but grinding it with my teeth) I was sitting there smiling like nothing ever happened. The taste is bitter-sweet, but entirely edible, very tolerable because it's so tiny. It certainly has addictive potential precisely because it is so useful. It sends me straight to sleep as well, meaning that even if I'm not that tired, it will make me very sleepy, and if I am tired it will knock me out completely, letting me sleep deeply for at least 7 hours before waking up. The sleep quality is so-so, I feel slightly groggy afterwards, but nothing compared to a real hangover.",DODO98

12,Valium,Anxiety,9.0,,"May 18, 2021",11,"Been on this since the beginning of the pandemic. At first it was two 2mg tablets per day and after a few weeks they took me off it. When I was first on it, it helped so much. I was made redundant and very low cause of of pandemic and this helped me get through lockdown. I think I would have went crazy otherwise! I am also long time sufferer of agoraphobia and valium was the only thing that really got that under control. I was taken off it and I had a relapse of anxiety and put back on gradually , I have been on and off it for a year, I am not addicted as during this time I have been off it sometimes weeks at a time. I still have bad days where I get anxious about covid etc a lot and take one 2mg, my usual dose is half or 1mg every other day and I'm doing ok. I feel like even now I'm on the smallest dose and also when I went through periods of not taking any at all, they seem to have trained my mind how to fight agoraphobia even without them so that has been a huge help in that way!",EMor

But just knowing it is there is enough to make me feel like it's gonna be ok.

Instead of making me relaxed, it made me extremely anxious and upset, to the point where I could not stop crying despite not being worried at all before taking the Valium. They also gave me laughing gas, which did not help. I was awake and able to remember all of the surgery, though I did blank out for a couple of seconds when they gave me Benadryl through an IV after removing the first 3 teeth. After receiving the Benadryl I started to feel calm again. But being able to remember the entire procedure is not a fun memory.",X Anon
18,Valium,Anxiety,10.0,,"December 15, 2020",31,"Due to many life events over 25 years, I live with PTSD & debilitating anxiety at unexpected intervals.Was tried on anti-depressant medication with horrible side-effects & not much of a primary effect. What has proven very effective is a low dose of Valium only when needed along with psychological support, exercise & a healthy diet.Valium turned my life around, is by script only & not taken daily. Even just knowing it is there as needed removes some anxiety without needing to take it. Young, inexperienced Dr's are less likely to prescribe it. Wise & worldly Dr's will monitor the dosage & regularity of scripts as well as making Valium just one part of a holistic treatment in the short term. At times I could not leave my condo yet with a broad & experienced approach to PTSD & severe anxiety my life, sleep, social interaction & personal discipline has normalised for the better. It is a gentle drug, unlike other drugs in its family that are stronger & highly addictive.",Donna

20,Valium,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 3, 2020",159,"Valium is a drug that can be a life saver or destroyer.This drug for me helps me as long as I have it under control. I find myself always having to be wary of my dosage. This allows me to pretty much go about my normal life, allows me to function, think and gives me the motivation and willingness to do the things I need to do. When on these and under control I find a lot of aspects of my life all coming together where as without it I feel helpless.Too much valium daily however leads to depersonalisation and impulsiveness. Before you know it you will be turning into something else, it is only in hindsight that this becomes apparent. As quickly as this can help improve your life it can crumble it.CONTROL YOUR DOSAGE.So if you can control yourself absolutely I would recommend but be wary it is very easy to lead yourself down the path of a benzo addiction, I have done this become clean and reused several times now.",shapel

22,Valium,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 9, 2020",350,"I have been on Valium since 2011 after the sudden passing of my husband. I have always had severe generalized anxiety and was never adequately treated for it, just given seroquel which made me non-functional.  The loss of my husband exacerbated the anxiety condition and I began suffering from insomnia as well. My Dr tried me on a variety of benzodiazepine meds which didn’t last long enough in my system to give me adequate relief. We eventually gave diazepam a try and it worked so well. I started on 20mg a day and over the years I have tapered to a comfortable dose of 10mg daily. It does not make me sleepy or loopy but takes the edge off enough that I can care for my children and function in daily life. Yes there is a bit of a dependence but for me it’s worth it to be somewhat addicted rather than struggle to cope with terrible anxiety symptoms every day. I do recommend Valium as an effective anxiolytic however I would say to be aware of the potential for abuse and dependence.",Quinn

I was under a great Psychiatrist for many years until he retired I then had to move to the country where it was extremely hard to even find a GP but I finally did but have had to go private & he has put me onto a barrage of new Dr's to see in the New Year who are all private as well so I am stressed about paying for all of these at the moment & getting the new GP to give me any Valium is like asking for his kidney but on 2 rare occasions he has given ten 10mg Temazepam's which did help but I had to stretch them out.",Lolly

In early 2017 I started with this new doctor who completely changed my psych regimen after a difficult move and sudden loss of a sister to a drug overdose. He started me on low dose Valium. It did work, but right away problems were showing. Soon enough I was hooked and popping these like life savers. My wife expressed concern about it, and what did the doctor do? He increased the dosage and quantity. Soon I was getting through the day with up to thirty pills. I experienced multi organ failure earlier this summer, and subsequent heart failure. My primary doctor recommended a new psychiatrist, who was shocked at my regimen. He said he wouldn’t see me until I had beaten the addiction. It was tough. He has since switched me to buspirone, although maxed out at 60mg. Valium may work in the short term, but just don’t do it. It’s a destroyer.",DJ

I took it twice, but 10mg  knocked me out, so I’d split the pill and take 5mg. I also have severe anxiety and depression and am prone to panic attacks, but I’d never taken meds for it (never asked). I had a couple panic attacks during recovery, took 5mg Valium, and it was like night and day. In 15 minutes I felt calm, relaxed and normal again. I rarely have panic attacks now, but my anxiety can be severe, so I’ll take a 1/4 pill (2.5mg), and it takes the edge off.

I recommend not using Valium for more than two days in a row, otherwise you will get addicted, and Valium is a nightmare to get off of if you are addicted. You will need to slow taper off of it if you have been taking this long-term, and this can take months or years. Check out Benzo Buddies for the horror stories.

I'm going through some withdrawal like tinnitus and night time sweats but I wake up better and have been feeling happiness. I strongly recommend staying off any benzodiazepine and if you are going to take it, only for bad panic attacks. Never take them daily as they are very addictive and quite difficult to get off of.

I believe my improvements are due to the combination of Valium, regular CBT therapy, and making consistent changes (ie pushing myself socially, improving diet and exercise). Many of us, can become overly reliant on medication, so I feel a holistic approach is needed for real, long term results. However, for moderate to severe anxiety/panic attacks, Valium is INCREDIBLE.

This medication has been a life saver for me and when I had PMDD (when it was just BAD PMS-in the '90's) I have taken Xanax in the past, and the forgetfulness was unbearable/couldn't drive, withdrawal was immediate and awful.  No problem with Valium!  My pain dr & regular dr won't prescribe Valium  to anyone anymore-long half life? Ativan,buspar didn't help at all.",beckisu92

Currently I've been tapering and I'm now down to 0.5mg x2 a day.  I never thought I could wean off that easy but I'm doing just fine.  Nuvigil and Valium have changed my life completely!  I also take 15- Seroquel XR and Mirtazapine to help me sleep at night.  There's nothing like having a good feeling hard working day, then coming home to a hot shower and putting all my stress aside to just relax.  Valium has helped me do this, A LOT better than Ativan did.",YoungDouble

I have not changed the dosage and have had no reason to increase it. Before I started this medicine, I would literally tremble when I would get nervous.  I don't even feel it in any way when I take it, but don't get anxious and am able to make decisions that I can't when I'm so nervous.  This medicine has worked miracles for me and if anyone thinks because it is a controlled substance that it is not a really good medicine for some people then they are wrong.",martha204

Now I use 2 mg, 4 times a day as needed, but only before lying down and never when I will be driving or need to otherwise be alert.
