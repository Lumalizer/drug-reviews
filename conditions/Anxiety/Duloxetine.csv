0,Duloxetine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 30, 2022",0,"Duloxetine was prescribed to me for muscle pains down my side, but ended up helping my anxiety! I didn't even know it was possible to feel so calm. I still have moments of rapid thoughts and obsessing, but the meds have given me the ability to stop spiralling as often, and take a step back from the anxiety. I feel like I can finally think more clearly. And the muscle pains are much better. This medication changed my life for the better. I tried antidepressants when I was younger and they pushed me into mania, so I was hesitant to think medication would work for me. It did, and I am thankful for my doctor who made the right call. The side effects I did have, sexual in nature, subsided after about a month of taking the meds. I make sure to take it at the same time every day to not miss doses, because it really isn't meant to be stopped abruptly. Withdrawal side effects for missing a dose for me have been anxiety and sometimes headaches. They advise to be weened off it if you have to stop.",Lyra
1,Duloxetine,Anxiety,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 23, 2022",1,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):I was prescribed Cymbalta for my anxiety. I suffer from migraines and paroxysmal hypertension which have been debilitating. I really wanted Cymbalta to work however it made my hypertension episodes much worse and I could not take it after the fifth dose. I also suffered from new onset night sweats, nausea and decreased appetite, dizziness, constipation and increased anxiety and agitation.  I’m sure that it has helped many people however the side effects for me were too severe to continue. It’s possible I could’ve continued if I did not have to work, but I have a full-time job. I will be trying another anxiety medication perhaps an SSRI. I just think that my body cannot handle the SSNRI. Everyone is different. My mom take Cymbalta and she had no side effects whatsoever and it works wonderfully for her. My mom suffers from migraines and fibromyalgia. I hope this helps somebody",Hope
2,Duloxetine,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 14, 2022",2,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):I was on this drug for 5 years, it helped with my depression tremendously. I came off it last year because things were going okay for me. I was diagnosed with GAD/Panic disorder when I was a teenager, the anxiety came back and I talked to my doctor about this, so I figured going back on Cymbalta was the right thing to do, but I was wrong. I do not struggle with depression anymore, just anxiety and panic attacks - going back on Cymbalta made my anxiety so much more worse, I think it had something to do with the Noradrenaline. The withdrawals sucked and I needed diazepam to help with it, I'm feeling so much better off of Cymbalta that the anxiety is so much smaller now, I'm going to be on an SSRI this time (Zoloft) This drug isn't for everyone, but I would not recommend it for people who struggle primarily with anxiety and Panic Disorder.",Not for Anxiety

I was running around the room 24/7 with no sleep at all. Had to go to the ER 3 times. It was a complete nightmare. Hadn't slept for 48 hours then the doc gave me a diazepam and I finally slept for 5 hours. Please don't take cymbalta. You're gonna regret it!",Person

7,Duloxetine,Anxiety,9.0,,"January 31, 2022",0,Cymbalta (duloxetine):By far the best medication for anxiety and panic disorder. Went off of it for a few months and had paralyzing anxiety and obsessive thoughts. Would snap at my family for the slightest thing. Back on cymbalta at 30 mgs and my anxiety is 80% better and I barely have panic attacks. Unfortunately for me it causes body twitches which is why I knocked off a point. I was on it for years with no side effects but now have body twitches for the last year 1.5 years. Still way better than living with constant anxiety and panic attacks!

Helped anxiety but felt like doing nothing but stare at a wall on lowest dose. Insomnia, constant headache, decreased libido, unable to focus, out of body feeling. These did not improve with time. After 3 months I decided it wasn’t worth it and started to wean off. Without a doubt the worst experience of my life, and it is still going on. 24/7 headaches, nightmares that are so real, I wake up believing they happened, unable to focus, severe vision changes, a feeling that I am not me. The doctor said these effects can last a week or many months. Obviously, I’m going to be on the wrong end of this. For those it helps, I’m very happy for you, but coming off (pray you don't) will be a nightmare that seems to never end.",Dave

Yes I had side effects loss of appetite, headache, constipation, dry mouth, dizzy spells. But I battled through and it was all worth it honestly. I found it so much better taking it before sleep by the way. It is hard to treat Borderline personality disorder but this medication really takes the edge off my condition. Also not as jumpy, nervous with my P.T.S.D. the nightmares have turned into good dreams thank god! I can smile and laugh again. Think straight. Live again.

My DO and Psych decided to give me this instead of Lexapro to also help with nerve pain. It changed me into someone I wasn’t, made me do things I wouldn’t usually do, I had a breakdown and then a disassociave episode where I don’t remember hardly anything about an entire summer. I thought it was making me better until after I stopped it. All the mental anguish and pain came back and I also saw what it had done to me as mentioned above. It’s a horrible drug that almost ruined my life. I cried every day even while on it.

I was on Cymbalta 20mg a day for around 2 weeks for a few reasons; I have severe anxiety and depression, and I also have a connective tissue disease that causes some nerve pain. One night I randomly started getting a burning sensation in my chest, armpits, arms, ears and forehead that felt like hot flushing, but imagine a normal flushing sensation amplified x100. I immediately started getting severe anxiety because I've never had this sensation before. I've had panic where you feel burning in your forehead, but I've never had this deep chest burning that would radiate into the armpits and sort of move across my upper body in waves. The strange sensations continued for hours and hours into the night, and I had multiple panic attacks into the next day. My doc stopped the drug.",Amanda
13,Duloxetine,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 7, 2022",1,"Duloxetine gave me my life back!I began experiencing debilitating anxiety that turned into depression for about four months before starting this drug. I was having anxiety attacks everyday, bursting into tears at work and home, and my anxiety was significantly interfering with my life. I was hesitant to go on an antidepressant but decided to try Prozac which was AWFUL!I had nausea combined with EXTREME depression and panic disorder on Prozac. I had to take FMLA off work because my anxiety and depression got so severe I couldn’t function. It was the worst experience of my life! The Dr stoped the Prozac after a month and started me on cymbalta. After 1 week, I felt the darkness lifting. Now it’s been 2 months and I am the happiest I have ever been! I have my energy and confidence back and feel like me! Only side effects are sexual and some night sweats but I’ll take that over falling back into the black hole I was in.

15,Duloxetine,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 16, 2021",4,"After reading negative reviews on this drug and previously trying Sertraline (with scary affects), I was terrified to start taking Duloxetine. However, I was also terrified by the affect that anxiety had had on my life for the 6 months previous. I can honestly say that this drug saved my life. It had a transformative affect on me, even after the first week of taking it and things only improved from there. As with all medicines there are some negatives, I am certainly more tired now that I take Duloxetine but the tiredness is extremely manageable, especially when coupled with light exercise and dietary improvements - both also help anxiety too ;).  So I would urge anyone struggling with anxiety who has been recommended/prescribed this drug to please give it a go - it could well transform your life and allow you to live to the full again.

More recently with Covid and my teenage daughter having treatment resistant depression, my nerves got frazzled, I had neck pain and headaches constantly from all the stress.  I started with Effexor (made my blood pressure feel too low) then Pristiq which gave me horrible headaches.  Now on 30 mg of duloxetine and it works so well:  no neck or headaches, nerves feel better, and aside from the first week of dry mouth and tiredness, my only side effect is a bit of tiredness sometimes.

I’ve been on tons of mental meds that wasn’t helping me. I’ve been hospitalized 4 times for manic episodes.

41,Duloxetine,Anxiety,7.0,,"July 15, 2021",2,"I live in the UK & was prescribed this drug by my psychiatrist. I was under the worst anxiety imaginable & at one of the lowest points of my life. He put me on 15mg for a week & said to increase to 30mg & gave me diazepam to settle nerves in the first week. I wanted the drug to get into my system ASAP so took the 30mg. The day was rough! Nausea, brain zap whilst driving (scary) anxiety, dizziness, tiredness. The following days I went to sleep at 6:30pm and struggled to eat anything. After day 4 I could feel myself improving! I stuck with it and my pain went away. I lost around 10lbs in 4 weeks. I like this drug as it fast acting compared to SSRIs which can take up to 6 weeks. The down side for me is my sex drive. I am a woman and struggle to climax which is a problem. If you think life can’t get worse, this drug is worth a try. Don’t go into work for the first few days of taking it as you will feel rough.

It made me feel so empty and depressed, which was concerning because I didn't feel that way before I was placed on it. The medicine also made me very irritable and gave me very violent thoughts which absolutely scared the poop out of me. My face swelled up terribly  as well which was the final straw that led me to stop taking it ASAP.

Aside from depression, I didn’t experience any other side effects except when I forgot to take it.  I tapered off it and experienced nausea, dizziness, mania (euphoria and irritability) when coming off it. It took a while to get out of my system completely. I personally did not find it difficult to come off of, just uncomfortable.I am no longer on cymbalta. My depression is gone but I now have anxiety again, so I can safely say that cymbalta can help with anxiety.

I have not felt this good in years. the first 2 weeks I did have a lot of side effects swetting, dizziness, insomnea, upset stomach, but after that I started feeling better. I have lost 20 lbs because I no longer feel hunger all the time. I feel like I did 20 years ago so much happier. I can't rave enough about it.",Kath E
367,Duloxetine,Anxiety,,,"November 18, 2007",129,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):I'm 29 & been on Cymbalta 1 week, prior to taking, couldnt sleep (4 hrs on average), panic attacks, acne break outs, hair falling out, highly stressed, now a little disoriented at times, loss of appetite (not a bad thing), great sleep(much needed) and Im much calmer. The doctor wants to add Wellbutrin in 30 days but I am not going that route. I am very pleased with the direction we are going in now it is just taking some time to adjust to the side effects and new routine of actually resting!!",xxoolostooxx
