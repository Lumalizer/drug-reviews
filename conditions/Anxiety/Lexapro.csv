I experience anxiety and some depression and was scared to go on meds after lots of therapy. I can say that my 10mg dose has truly changed my life and brought my life back to normal. I have did experience some weight gain however my life over the past 1.5 years being so much better is worth it. Overall, I recommend Lexapro! It gave me my sparkle back and I hope can for you!

3,Lexapro,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 2, 2022",17,"I don’t know who needs to hear this but this drug saved my life. I have suffered with anxiety since childhood but never knew what it was till my twenties. By the time I was 27 I was virtually an agoraphobic that was afraid to go anywhere and had panic attacks atthe grocery store and at my job, it was debilitating. When my ex and I split and I moved into my apartment I was a mess, I could literally not eat or sleep and never left my house. It got so bad that I told my mother I thought I would either commit myself into a hospital or kill myself. She talked me into seeing my doc. He prescribed me 5mg of lexapro and I had my mom stay the night in case I had a bad reaction. Within a week I felt much better and my only side effect was that I was sleepy in the morning. Within the year of this drug I have become a completely different person. I have no anxiety and I don’t worry about anything. I run every morning, I got a new job and a new relationship! I finally feel normal and starting to live life!",Nervous nelly
4,Lexapro,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 1, 2022",9,"For nearly a decade I was terrified to try any kind of psychiatric medication. I was afraid it would change my personality, turn me into a zombie, make me go crazy, you name it. 3 years ago I finally tried Lexapro for my OCD and anxiety and it has changed my life so drastically. I should start by saying I also went to therapy and that helped tremendously, but I went from being someone who was afraid to drink tap water, had terrible agoraphobia, and weekly panic attacks, to being almost entirely anxiety free. The only side effects I've experienced are slight decrease in sex drive and slight flattening if highs and lows in my mood. I slowly went from 2.5 mg to 5 to 7.5 and now I take 10mg daily",Sarah
5,Lexapro,Anxiety,10.0,,"February 25, 2022",3,"For anyone scared to take this medication do it. I was very against taking this medication because of all the bad reviews. I tried all kinds of natural remedies to help with my anxiety and depression and nothing was helping. I felt so hopeless and would cry praying every day to feel better and nothing was cutting it. I went to several different doctors hoping I was wrong and I didn’t need the medication till I spoke to a new doctor who treated me like a friend and not a patient. I was so lost didn’t want to work and when I did go I wanted to leave and not be around anyone. Some days were better then others, when I had that anxious feeling that would not go away and I just felt as if something bad was going to happen. I said I needed to do something about it. I cried and decided to take the lexapro. The first few days were a bit hard I felt jittery nervous but kept on going. About a week into taking the pill I started to notice the difference. I feel myself again❤️",Anonymous
6,Lexapro,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 21, 2022",1,"Previously I had good results with Lexapro & stopped taking it after 10 months. Had a health scare & my anxiety got really bad. Started on 10 & after learning I needed surgery went up to 20. I also take Klonopin. After surgery I went back to 10mg. Last few weeks family drama triggered panic & anxiety. Went back up to 20. I reduced my Klonopin to .25 at night since .5 with 20mg of Lexapro made me tired in the morning. Feeling so much better. Can talk myself out of anxious thoughts, not on the verge of tears anymore, I have energy to do things. I have had crippling anxiety for decades. It’s stolen so much from me. This medication has made a big difference. I know anxiety can make you feel hopeless & helpless but don’t give up!!! It’s so nice to look forward to the start of a new day when the alarm goes off instead of dreading what my mind might put me thru. When 1st starting Lexapro it made my anxiety worse but that passes. I switched to name brand & works better for me.",Dee
7,Lexapro,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 17, 2022",3,"I've been taking lexapro for the past 7 months and it really helps, at first my anxiety and dark moods went worse and the drug took about 8 weeks to work. Now I am able to function and although I can still get frightened, its manageable.  I take 20mg and have no intentions of coming off it. The side effects are less severe than other drugs and I feel relaxed . Good luck and don't give up.",Anonymous
8,Lexapro,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 8, 2022",4,"I was so scared to try any medication for my anxiety, but I am so grateful that I did. I have had bad anxiety since as long as I remember, being 24 in the midst of the pandemic, I decided to take a leap. I took 2.5 then increased to 5, then after a couple months increased to 10 mg and have been taking it for 8 months.  First taking it, my side effects were just tiredness, not any nausea which is what I was afraid of - but more just not ""feeling"" hungry, but I would just remind myself to eat. At first it felt like it made no change because it was gradual, but I realized over the months that I have been in the best mental state I have EVER been in. My panic attacks, diarrhea everyday, constant dissociation, constant shallow breathing, has lessened so much. Less crying and mental breakdowns every other week. It is such a relief. Now, I still have anxiety - it doesn't go away, but it doesnt feel like it has full control over my life.",Anonymous
9,Lexapro,Anxiety,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 6, 2022",1,"Okay so this is my third and final update on lexapro.  After trying it for over two months, it just wasn’t for me. I’ve never been suicidal, but it was causing suicidal ideations, it improved my anxiety, but made my depression so much worse. I just tapered off the lexapro and now giving Zoloft a try. My doc also added lamotrigine for the depression. This is just my experience, so please please don’t let others experience with a medication keep you from taking it. While lexapro didn’t work for me, it might be a miracle for someone else. Everyone’s chemistry and response is different. Please be patient and kind to yourself and give the medication a chance. The good news, if this one doesn’t work for you, there is one out there that will!!!",Anonymous
10,Lexapro,Anxiety,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 2, 2022",2,"Started on Sertraline and moved onto this, too quickly probably, having not given the former a proper chance. Six months in and I feel the benefit and real relief from a lifelong condition. The one piece of advice is to give these meds a chance, results simply don't come overnight. It's only when several weeks, or months, have elapsed do you realise that an improvement has taken place. I would counsel against anything other than small amounts of alcohol, particularly in the first few weeks. It's not particularly down to interactions (it wasn't in my case anyway) it's just that alcohol just wipes out the gains that you get from these medications,In terms of side effects, yes there are some, but they do seem to pass (4-6 weeks) and for me at least, it's a trade off between those and the continued impact of anxiety. One needs to make up one's own mind on this. 10mg for me at the moment.",PJM
11,Lexapro,Anxiety,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 2, 2022",2,"I just started lexapro last night. My doctor wants me to take it with my Prozac for a week until I get my body used to taking the lexapro. Let me just say in just one day this has been the most horrible experience ever. I had sharp stomach pains and really bad nauseous at night. I couldn’t sleep very good even though I was so tired, my heart was racing when I got up, and then when I went to class my anxiousness got worse than it’s ever been and I got a hot flash. I'm gonna not take the meds tonight to see how I feel tomorrow. If I feel better these meds aren’t worth it!",Anonymous
12,Lexapro,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 30, 2022",4,"Y’all, I haven’t had a panic attack in 2 MONTHS. I used to get them every single day sometimes twice a day and it got to a point where I didn’t even wanna live anymore. As soon as I started lexapro I knew I was doing something right because after just two weeks on 5mg I was feeling better and going out of my comfort zone. It’s now been a month and a half on 10mg and I feel so great! I still have anxiety, worries and struggles. But I am able to calm myself down and release it. The first two weeks of it is rough (dizziness, tiredness, increased anxiety) but if you stick it out you won’t be sorry. I really hope this will help someone out there.",Kendra
13,Lexapro,Anxiety,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 26, 2022",2,"So I left a review a couple of weeks ago, around the four week mark and thought I would provide and update now at the 7 week mark. My lexapro (generic) was increased to 15mg two weeks ago and I actually feel like it has made my depression slightly worse with minimal improvement on the anxiety. My doctor just prescribed rexulti as an add on to the lexapro as it can help with resistant depression. I am also going to ask if I can go back down to the 10mg lexapro as I feel that helped a little more than the 15mg. Since starting the 15mg I’ve noticed more intrusive thoughts and a feeling that I quite can’t shake. Now with all this being said, this is just my experience. For some it works wonders, for others not so much. Be patient with yourself because it is all trial and error. And don’t get discouraged.",Rmpass
14,Lexapro,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 26, 2022",27,"On the this for depression and anxiety. I started having suicidal thoughts and so hopelessly sad. I started therapy but didn't notice much difference. I was against taking meds but  eventually I gave up and asked the doc to prescribe ssri's for me and she had me started on 5 mg a day escitalopram generic.The first week I felt good  with some weird dreams and a bit of euphoria and some nausea. Week 2 I started having nightmares that was very vivid and horrible and anxiety got worse. Week 3 was also not fun  but very similar to week 2. I was a bit more sad. Week 4 I started feeling a bit better. Week 5  the doc upped the dose to 10 mg. I felt good for 4 days then my body started adjusting to new dose and it took 2 weeks of lower mood again. Nausea came back first 4 days of 10 mgs  in week 6 I started to feel much better. Now at week 8 no anxiety and no depression - I feel great. I've been exercising, cutting caffeine, eating healthy, no weight gain, no sex problems life is beautiful again. Give it time",Andreas Danielsson

16,Lexapro,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 13, 2022",11,"29 year old female, experiencing post pandemic anxiety. Prescribed 10mg lexapro for social anxiety and a fear of panicking in social situations. My anxiety became all consuming - I'd tried CBT, have been in psychotherapy for a long time, meditation etc. Medication was my last resort and I was really hesitant to start this as I didn't know if my anxiety was 'that bad' or if I could handle my own internalised stigma about being 'someone on meds'. Well, that's me now, and as soon as I started it I haven't looked back. SO glad I tried them, it took about 8 weeks for me to feel anything different, but once I did it just helped me to feel myself, balanced, not stressing about small things. I have my social life back. I had no side effects (apart from it taking slightly longer to orgasm) but even this has pretty much gone. I  feel like it was such a good decision to start lexapro, and I don't fear tapering off when the time is right as it was very easy going on them! Good luck :)",m2021
17,Lexapro,Anxiety,9.0,,"January 8, 2022",3,"Patience is a virtue. I started lexapro 10mg after experiencing severe anxiety and panic attacks with mild depression after a recent move. I’ve never had anxiety, panic attacks, or depression until now. It was so bad, I sought help in a mental health hospital where I was started on lexapro and buspar. I want all to know that it might get worse before it gets better. Week three I had myself convinced it wasn’t working and I needed something else. By week four it was starting to even out. I’m nearing the end of my fourth week and while I’m not 100% back to my usual self, the improvement is obvious. I’m excited to see where this medication takes me in the next few weeks as I know it takes at least 4-6 weeks to really reach its full potential, sometimes even longer. I’ve learned to be patient with myself, be kind to myself, and in conjunction with therapy I think this medication really helps!! My biggest side effect has been loss of appetite which is returning and GI upset.",Anonymous

I finally decided to seek help from my doctor. Lexapro has completely calmed my anxiety during the day time and nightmares. I no longer feeldepressive or suicidal thoughts. The negative side effects I’ve experienced so far are loss of libido. However, after a porn addiction for a decade, the loss of libido isn’t bad.

20,Lexapro,Anxiety,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 11, 2021",1,"I was on Lexapro for three weeks. It did not work well for me. I had been suffering from anxiety and depression. It may have slightly helped my anxiety, but it far worsened my depression. I was having suicidal thoughts constantly that felt uncontrollable. I started at 10 mg and about 5 hours after taking the pill I felt like my body and head were on fire and I was extremely nauseous. This lasted for a few days but I cut the pills in half to 5 mg. Lexapro didn’t do anything for me. It made me feel like a zombie and I couldn’t cry when I wanted to or feel normal emotion. I realized it takes up to a month for full effect, but my doctor told me I should have had some relief by three weeks and I did not. Careful weaning off of it. I have bad headaches and dizziness now. Hopefully they'll go away soon.",M.M
21,Lexapro,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 7, 2021",55,"(Male/24) Initially lexapro made my anxiety worse, quite significantly. I experienced both anxiety & panic attacks at a greater frequency compared to prior to starting. Despite this, I have continued to take the medication with the hope that this side effect would lessen, despite most of my thoughts begging me to stop this medication. After about 12 days, I felt my body adjusting to the dosage. The last two days I have felt really great, no anxiety or racing heart rate (another initial side effect), no panic attacks and improved mood and enjoyment in things. I wanted to share just in case others are experiencing initial worsening anxiety and are unsure if this improves over time. Although my one experience is anecdotal, I am glad I stuck with it. I experienced headaches, nausea, jitteriness and trouble sleeping the first week as well, those too have gone away. My appetite has improved, and have had no complication with sexual dysfunction. I hope this helps",Oran

I wanted to die, I could sleep and felt awful.I woke up every day and go for a run just to get rid of my anxiety. I herniated my discs during severe workouts only to get rid of those horrible anxiety after waking up. My gf left me and I lost my health.I was depressed and anxious before but lexapro after one month destroyed me so much that I am not the same person anymore. Even 3mg did not help during these horrible lexapro times.Stay away from LEXAPRO it can ruin your life and destroy you.I used zoloft and xanax before but without any side effects.

23,Lexapro,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 4, 2021",9,"I was prescribed 10mg for anxiety and depression. the first 2 weeks gave me terrible side effects of nausea, suicidal thoughts, constant anxiety and loss of appetite which made it really difficult to eat anything at all and caused me to lose a bunch of weight. I stayed on it for 4 more weeks and the side effects at this point were only mild but my anxiety and depression stayed the same so at the 6 week mark my gp recommended withdrawing from lexapro and trying a different antidepressant. Even though I wasn’t on the med for very long, the withdrawals are bad with headaches, nausea, disassociation, anxiety and some of the strongest suicidal thoughts i’ve ever experienced. This isn’t to discourage anyone from taking it because I've heard many positive experiences, but be prepared for the side effects and stay safe!",plant

My Dr suggested   lexapro and as terrified as I was about taking it I was desperate.  Fast forward 7 months and wow, I am me again.... I can honestly say it gave me my life back.

The bad side effects made me want to lose hope in them but I kept taking them now I have noticed that I don't get nauseous, I don't get headaches as often as I used to, I don't panic at work (or before) and waking up have been easier.

It has been 1 month now on Lexapro and it has been somewhat of a rollercoaster, but it was worth it. Let me start off by saying LISTEN TO YOUR BODY!

The 2nd week of being on 10mg was awful, my anxiety was intensified and I was having more panic attacks. I saw my doctor and she put me back down to 5mg, and I feel amazing! While everybody reacts to medication differently, the best piece of advice I have is to  be patient and make sure you listen to your body and be in contact with your provider.

30,Lexapro,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 15, 2021",6,"Lexapro gave me back my quality of life. I was a beyond anxious nursing student with social anxiety who felt like I was deteriorating from the inside out. I cried multiple times a week and started isolating myself from friends as I was so fearful of the unknown. I always felt against taking medication but then gave in and can't imagine going back to how my life was before it. I am so much happier, sillier, and calm. I still have spouts of anxiety and obsessing, but I can more easily move past it and keep going, which I could never do before as it would literally consume me. The lexapro took about 10-12 weeks to fully work but I am so happy I waited it out. I also had no side effects except for vivid dreams. If you are thinking about it, do it!

31,Lexapro,Anxiety,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2021",11,"I need to start off by thanking everyone who has taken the time to share their positive reviews of Lexapro on this site. I’m 3 days into my prescription and my mind is racing. Starting August this year I had a health scare followed by a bout of terrible IBS. Triggering the worst anxiety I’ve ever experienced. I’ve lost 10 lbs in about a month. I’m pretty small to begin with! So I ended up in the ER last week. They said while I may have IBS it’s likely caused by uncontrolled anxiety. Referred me to a psychiatrist, a gastroenterologist and my primary care doc. I went to see my pcp this past Monday and she put me on 5mg’s of lexapro for 7 days and 10mg’s after that. So far dry mouth is my worst complaint, also have no appetite like forcing myself to eat and insomnia. Hoping the side effects which currently feel just as bad as the anxiety symptoms level off soon.

It made me go insane to the point I had to ring the GP and cry down the phone that I was going mad because I couldn’t stop full body tremors and panic all day to the point my ribs are now permanently painful. It is an awful drug like the rest of the SSRIs. The only way to fix anxiety is resolve the underlying unless it truly is a serotonin problem.

36,Lexapro,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 28, 2021",6,"About a month ago I experienced my first panic attack while driving and then it was just downhill since then, was getting completely anxious every time I had to drive. I started on 5mg of Lexapro 8 days ago and just increased to 10mg. I have had increased anxiety around more than just driving now which feels like an adrenaline rush, but goes away just as fast. I also have experienced nausea, dry mouth, and feeling dizzy/drowsy. The only symptom that got worse when I increased the dose so far was the dizziness which affects my vision to the point I cannot focus on one point. After reading all these reviews, I am very hopeful and plan to stick it out and can see the light at the end so THANK YOU!

I've taken meds with serotonin in the past and none of them have done this to me.

My therapist prescribed lexapro 5mg and then work up to 10mg. The side effects I experienced at first were nausea, headaches, and absolutely terrible restless insomnia. Then, after increasing my dose a month into taking it, I had an absolutely terrible experience. I had terrible intrusive thoughts that were completely against who I am. I had panic attacks that went on for days. I couldn’t sleep or eat. I was a different person, I felt like I had lost my mind and myself completely. It was the most terrifying experience I’ve ever had. I immediately stopped taking it and then the withdrawal began. The intense brain zapping feeling, the dizziness, the continuing anxiety attacks, the nightmares, the insomnia…. I feel like I was just pumping my body with poison.

Well, that all hit the fan after quarantining, having a tough breakup, and just feeling hopeless. I finally began experiencing physical pain from my anxiety and depression along with a racing heart and thoughts at night. I went to a few doctors and they all told me it was likely caused by anxiety and one of them prescribed me 10mg if lexapro daily. I looked at the bottle for weeks before deciding to take it. I felt like a failure for taking antidepressants, but within a few weeks, I couldn't believe, I was my natural happy self again. It didn't make me euphoric at all, only my true optimistic, laughing self again...the best part of me. I'm now in week 6ish or 7 I believe and I feel amazing.

44,Lexapro,Anxiety,10.0,,"October 20, 2021",14,"Hello everyone I just wanted to share my experience. This is the third time I started lexapro for GAD and panic attacks. I found out that the right dosage for me is 20mg (I’m a 23 year old and fit woman). Throughout the years, thanks to therapy, I learnt how to cope with anxiety and panic attacks, anyways one symptom that would never leave me and I could never learn how to cope with was air hunger/ breathlessness/ hyperventilation/ whatever. I had this symptom from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed: I was okay only when I was sleeping, and I thought I was going crazy and was insane. Started lexapro again after this symptom worsened, and as I said I started it for the third time in 5 years, and I can happily say that after 37 days (yes, I kept a journal) I am finally feeling like myself again.

Now I don’t have an elaborate story that is super compelling. I was just a person who was struggling with intense anxiety and depression for a long period of time. It got to the point that I was pretty much having breakdowns everyday and would just go into my car and cry. After going therapy for a few months I noticed a small change but the feeling I had inside just wouldn’t go away. Eventually I started to think about trying medication. My doctor recommended I try Lexapro. At first I started at 10mg and after a couple weeks it was really helping and I was happy about that. But after about 5 weeks I had a honest conversation with my doctor and told him I feel there is another level I can get to. He said that is completely normal and recommended that I go up to 20mg.

A lot was going on in my life at the time (working and going to grad school, renovating a house by myself, unhealthy relationship) and my brain was on absolute overdrive.  I wasn't sleeping and was having panic attacks everyday multiple times a day.  My mother recommended Lexapro and it changed my life.  My anxiety got worse the first two weeks but after that the symptoms began to taper and I started sleeping better again.  From my experience, I didn't start to feel 100% for about a month or two.  There's something absolutely critical you have to understand about this medicine, it's dulls the symptoms but DOES NOT fully cure them.  For me, working on myself mentally, getting exercise, eating right, and taking back my life in addition to the medicine helped tremendously and my doctor agrees this is the way you should handle this medicine.

My psychiatrist claims that the last batch of generic Lexapro  was probably a bad batch. So he upped my dose to 20mg, of generic Lexapro that made me really sick. Now I am taking 15mg of generic Lexapro and still sick. I am going to try 5mg of generic Lexapro . If that doesn't work I am contemplating taking the expensive brand of Lexapro. I also take 7.5 mg of mirtazapine at.5p.m. Has anyone taken generic Lexapro and switched to the brand Lexapro? Was there any improvement? Any thoughts?",Texman

It’s astounding how different I am now compared to where I was at last year mentally. I used to have horrible crying spells, I would scream uncontrollably, and had terrifying anxiety attacks. Lexapro helped me to become my old self again and helps me to control/better regulate my emotions. I can honestly say that I feel like a brand new person! The first few months I had some side effects- twitching/spasms in my fingers and very vivid/crazy dreams, but these side effects were pretty tolerable and went away eventually.

It was literally ruining my relationship and friendships. I was constantly tired and angry at the world. I had talked to my Dr and we both decided I should give lexapro a try. I was very hesitant at first but I picked up my prescription of 5 mg. The first couple of days were terrible I'm not going to lie to you. I had intense brain fog, brain zaps, I would fall asleep and wake up with intense anxiety. But you know what got me through that? the reviews on THIS site! Telling me it was going to be okay and give it a chance! I told my Dr my symptoms and she prescribed me a small dose of xanax to take before bed.

80,Lexapro,Anxiety,10.0,,"July 5, 2021",172,"I am grateful for those who have posted on this site, as it was so helpful to read your comments.I began taking Lexapro 7 days ago for anxiety.  For years I have had feelings of anxiety, racing pulse, fight or flight feeling,  palpitations, adrenaline with some depression. My dr started me out on 5 mg, and I believe that is the right dose for me.  By day 3, I actually started feeling a bit better.  This does give me some dry mouth, but I have no trouble sleeping.  I feel slightly off or different but does not hamper me in any way.  My evening glass of wine tastes different.  By day 7, today, I dealt with some dating / relationship issues and pandemic dread and instead of it being as debilitating as it could have been in the past, I felt a lot calmer.  I'm feeling SO MUCH BETTER.  Of course we must do the internal work, (therapy, changing past habits that do not serve us) but I truly believe this is a miracle drug.  I wish you all the best in your wellness journey!",Michelle G
81,Lexapro,Anxiety,10.0,,"July 4, 2021",154,"I started taking Lexapro 5 weeks ago and I can't say enough good about it. I was seriously depressed and my anxiety of just going to work, dealing with everyday life, and staying positive was difficult at best. I broke down and went to the doctors, I'm the kinda dude that doesn't go to the doctors unless it's serious! Anyways very few side effects I had a headache for about a week it wasn't bad just kind of annoying. But I felt that this side effect was manageable, after 5 weeks I am seriously affected positively, my life has changed much, no more bad feelings, no more fear, no more panic attack feelings, no more tight chest, I feel more confident with where life is going, and I owe it all to Lexapro and support from my family! Don't give up, I almost did and So glad I didn't, I have way more positive outlook on my life now!",Yoda

I am not going to lie, the first 2-3 weeks are the hardest but I am on week 5 and OMG do I feel great about life and myself!! This drug has given me such an uplift and I can feel my emotions are leveled out!! Things that would stick with me and bring on my anxiety no longer stick with me. I feel the emotion but it subsided and I can move on in my day. I am so so happy to have found this drug! I finally feel like I know what it’s like to live a normal life.

My GP gave me Lexapro. I started on 10mg tab. I got no sleep and felt horrible so I stopped taking it. I did research and people were saying that it usually takes a month or so to start working. And it can make symptoms worse in the meantime. This really scared me. But after talking with some other people that use it I decided to give it another go. But this time I started on half a tablet (5mg). I could sleep thankfully. It did give me strange feelings for the first week. Not that my condition got worse, but I just felt a little off. After a week I started to slowly notice that the depression and anxiety was starting to lift. I upped my dose to 7mg .Within week 3 there was an amazing shift. I feel amazing!

I started to self-medicate with marijuana which honestly worked miracles for me up until recently.  I'm starting to feel that weed is causing me more anxiety. Two weeks ago I blacked out and had two major attacks from excessive smoking. These last few attacks landed me in the ER twice in two days.

I had side effects from Lexapro  including horrible constant nausea, shivers, terrible GERD/gut issues, genital numbness, insomnia, memory problems, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts. The more bizarre ones are sweating a lot, bad body odor, ear ringing, muscle twitches, jittery hands. Mind you: I am a young woman, with no medical condition. And only a couple of mgs of this medication left me with terrific physical problems, and I'm just hoping they will heal with time. I felt a little ease in my anxiety at the beginning, but I'm pretty sure that was just the brain fog numbing my ability to think anxiously (and to think at all). I didn't feel like myself.

If I do, I’m able to think clearly. And I don’t perform compulsions either. I went from a high 20 level of anxiety to about a 1-2.

After an extremely stressful event I eventually 'crashed' & could no longer function. I couldn't eat, had terrible restlessness, I felt like I was detached from everyone & everything, I couldn't focus, I was confused, not sleeping at all most nights & depression hit hard. I had no choice but to begin medication immediately. The initial side effects of Cipralex wore off after about 2 weeks. My appetite returned, I began sleeping again & I felt calm. The side effects were minimal & were a small price to pay for the benefits of the medication. I was on 10mg for 14 months & tapered off gradually over 4 months. I had discontinuation symptoms of anxiety & insomnia for a few days but it's now been 2 weeks since stopping completely & I'm feeling great!",Bex

121,Lexapro,Anxiety,10.0,,"January 17, 2021",105,"Lexapro changed my life for sure!  My family has a history of anxiety so it was not a surprise when I started having severe anxiety and panic attacks. That warm, flush, buzzing feeling that overtakes your body and your mind immediately thinks you’re going to die or that you're sick. Your heart is racing and feels like it’s going to jump out of your chest and your head is spinning.  It’s a feeling I don’t wish on anyone and it was starting to control my life. Once I started lexapro I almost immediately noticed positive results. It took about 6 weeks to really notice significant changes and about a year before I would say I was 100% myself. But it very quickly made my life manageable and now I can’t imagine my life without it!  I still get breakthroughs now and then where I get a bout of anxiety but it’s usually short lived and manageable. If you have just started lexapro hang in there!",Much better

Not sure if I should stop this med or continue so I opted for the latter. I'm giving it a couple more weeks hopefully it kicks in if not I'll try something else.,Jk

I would read these reviews for encouragement in my darkest moments. Go for walks, talk with your loved ones, allow yourself to lay low and give the medication a chance to work. My appetite is still missing and I’m still have racing/disturbing thoughts but I feel better each day! My insomnia has subsided and the muscle twitches.

If I could rate it higher than 10 I would. I see that a lot of people have low libido on this medication, but that is not the case with me. My sex drive has actually improved massively when anxiety & depression aren't in the picture. I've been on 10mg Lexapro for 2 years and it has taken the very dark lows out of my life without any side effects. My emotions more controlled, my anxiety is calmer, my life is such much more manageable. Only con to lexapro is night sweats & brain zaps (only if I forget a dose - if I don't forget a dose, that doesn't happen). Other than that, I cannot recommend Lexapro enough. It has improved my life tenfold & given my happiness back. Lexapro doesn't make you feel like a zombie; I feel more myself than I have my whole life. Take negative reviews with a grain of salt. It could be your miracle drug too.",Pickles

I was able to do things like go into my laundry room and do one load of laundry without feeling overwhelmed by the other 5 loads that needed to be done. My anxiety was an all or nothing situation- I either could do it all at one time or could NEVER get it done in my brain.

I started at a 10 mg tablet and about 6 months after I started, my dose was upped to the 20 mg tablet. It made me feel completely exhausted before I started taking a stimulant and overall in the beginning, I felt okay. After about a year of being on this medication, I became very depressed and overly sensitive (when I was never like this in the past) and it made me feel overall more depressed than I had before and slightly suicidal. A little after 2 years of taking this medication, I decided to no longer continue using it and suddenly stopped, cold turkey. There were some withdrawal phases, but overall I felt so much better once I stopped using it. I feel that this medication would probably have been more effective for me if I used it for a short term and not for a duration of more than a year.",Lex

The only negative for me is that I know I am on something.

I’m looking forward to how I’ll feel in another 4 weeks! No side effects have remained after the initial week or two. I did find it made me sleepy taking it in the morning, so I just changed to taking it at night which solved that problem. Hang in there if you’re just starting it and it’s rough. It will get better!",CC
165,Lexapro,Anxiety,3.0,,"December 30, 2019",37,"Was diagnosed with anxiety recently and prescribed Lexapro. First few days felt weird, started getting headaches, brain fog, libido gone. These were common effects so I kept it going. I noticed my anxiety was gone, but I couldn't cry either. I was emotionally numb and had no empathy for others. 8 days in I started getting suicidal thoughts. Keep in mind I start this for anxiety and NOT depression/suicidal thoughts! I was very scared of myself as it felt like a second conscience was forming in my brain, one that'd tell me I'm worthless and ugly, and I'd argue with it with my normal conscience. 3 days into these new thoughts the more I was on it the more this depressive conscience took over, and I was forming ways on how to commit suicide. I was too scared to continue at this point so I stopped and my anxiety is back but I have not gotten suicidal thoughts since. And this was all only on 5mg. As said by my doctor, please halt using this drug immediately if you get suicidal thoughts.",cynicaldemiurge

It took about 6 weeks for the drug to really start working along with minimal side effects. It has been a year and I am currently tapering off the medication because I feel I do not need it anymore.

I feel as though I can function normally, that I can have conversations with people without freaking out or worrying as much on how I came across to others.

Well, let me tell you. I took it six days and stopped. I had racing heart, numbness in leg and so dizzy I almost hit the floor. Once again, doctor said this is not from Lexapro. I talked him into clonazepam for short term. He was reluctant but I am responsible and have done clonazepam in the past for short term.  It is 0.5 daily for two weeks and then a short taper.

It’s difficult to know what one is best for you and your body so often you have to try a couple of different ones before you find your fit. In my personal experience it’s worth trying a few till you find what’s right for you. Every medication is going to have side effects. For me Lexapro decreases my sex drive and causes constipation. The benefit of not having anxiety and being able to be a peaceful wife and mother is worth those two side effects for me. I have come off my Lexapro before and it’s true you will definitely have a lot of brains zaps, headache, a little irritability, and for me déjà vu. The brains zaps don’t usually last more than two months and they are harmless so you just have to ignore them.

I began taking a full 10 mg pill a few days ago (I’m on day 10) and I have noticed I am back to my normal self.  The anxiety has completely gone away.   It seems it has saved my life.  The exhaustion and headaches went away.  It seems like this may be common in the first week or so.  The  negative to lexapro is some issues with sex (ejaculating specifically).  I have heard your body can adjust and eventually that will become normal as well.  I would definitely recommend people to give this medicine a few weeks to a month before giving up on it.  Mine took about 9 days to kick in.",Jay

Within days, I go from  anti-social nervous wreck when I'm off it, to a very rational, confident and outgoing person when I'm back on it.If you're painfully anxious, negative and self-loathing (like I find myself sometimes) , Lexapro can make you the life of the party - an empathetic, engaged and caring human being you know you really are deep down inside.I started taking in my 40s- it would have drastically altered my life if I had started at a younger age.

Prior to taking the medication, I felt high levels of anxiety that would especially interfere with my ability to concentrate during class.The first few days, I experienced some insomnia and kept waking up frequently throughout the night. DON’T LET THIS STOP YOU FROM CONTINUING IT. The unpleasant side effect wore off very quickly. As of now, my level of anxiety has significantly decreased. I feel much more confident socializing and can finally concentrate. The ONLY problem is feeling very tired and lethargic, which I think is a much better alternative to feeling anxious all the time because you are at ease. I am glad I did not listen to the negative reviews even though I was very scared at first!",MickeyMouse44

I feel confident. I feel like who I was mean to to be. My best piece of advice is to not obsess about whether or not it’s working. You WILL know when it does, trust me.

297,Lexapro,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 4, 2019",138,"Before starting Lexapro, I was a complete mess. GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) had completely taken over my life. I could barely go outside without having an anxiety attack. I started Lexapro 5 mg two years ago and my life completely changed. It took about 2 weeks for me to feel a difference, and I was blown away by how different my life was. I was going to concerts, traveling, doing things I never thought I would be able to do with my level of anxiety. I switched off Lexapro to try a new drug recently to see if it would work better, but it made my anxiety worse than ever. Thankfully I started Lexapro again last week and I already feel so much better. This drug honestly saved my life and even though everyone is different, I would completely recommend trying it if you have GAD. The side effects (for me) were mild, only some insomnia and a little dizziness, so I would say if your starting it to wait a week or so, and you’ll feel a difference. I hope my review helps!",Sb144

After an hour I felt a bit tired, as if everything slowed me down for a second and it took hours. I was not scared because it was not very scary but a pretty uncomfortable.

305,Lexapro,Anxiety,9.0,,"November 26, 2018",130,"Please give it a try! It works! Here are some recommendations based on my experience. It won't ""fix"" you, but it'll make it so you can actually breathe again. I used to cry constantly, isolate myself, have panic attacks so frequently I couldn't even sleep, and have horrible intrusive violent thoughts. 1. be proactive when it comes to the nausea side effect. Eat BEFORE you take the pill, and don't let yourself get hungry during the first 3-4 hours after you take the pill. Because once you get nausea it becomes harder to eat, which only makes you more nauseous. It's a vicious cycle that can be prevented.2. ignore the negative reviews that are like ""I took this pill for 1 day and it caused *terrifying side effects*."" They only cause more anxiety and they're highly unlikely. 3. From my personal experience, the first things to get better were the physical symptoms of anxiety. Less panic attacks, more hungry, less crying, etc. Keeping a journal is helpful to see the progression.",snazzycat

I had improvement in anxiety symptoms after about 3 weeks. HOWEVER I was very ill and bedridden. My mind was calm but also I did not want to do anything. I didn't care about anything. I lost my car, my home, my job - everything because I didn't care! I was always sleepy and could sleep 14 hours straight. I had major sexual dysfunction at 26 years. I tapered off slowly after about 8 weeks. I was left with constant dizziness weeks after to the point that I fell down the stairs.  Over a month after stopping, I'm doing well. No meds. Just making positive changes and counselling and trying to get back everything I lost in a couple of months on this med. I still have a little anxiety but I'm learning to control it. Gotta control it or it'll control you! I've learned that anxiety is like a bully. You have to confront it and not try to ignore it. Move TOWARD your fear! Slowly it will get better!",tito

I always stressing about EVERYTHING, I didn't sleep, I cried over every little inconvenience, I could never wind down and take a nap for example, I was always agitated, had rapid heart beat, and so much more. I wasn't living, I was suffering. I finally took the decision to take Lexapro and at first; the side effects weren't pleasurable I will say that. But after a week, they started going away and I could tell I was getting better. It is now about 6 weeks in or more, I can notice a huge improvement. I'm much more calm and I am so much happier.

Anxiety mostly characterized by racing thoughts, over analyzing, and overthinking. The first two weeks I had increased anxiety, and nausea. I didn't feel anything until the full two months. Its not a significant change but it takes the edge off. I have more motivation, can recognize my trailing thoughts and compulsions and stop them before they spiral out of control. I don't feel the need to make a big deal out of certain situations. I feel like I have more control and that I am gaining my life back. My anxiety was focused on my relationship at the time I started (constant overanalyzing, creating problems that don't exist, worried about making mistakes) which eventually got to the point that it was effecting my work ability. I still have some anxiety which is GOOD because I want to be able to manage it on my own. I think a lot of it is the medication and my own personal work. Overall I am very satisfied",Ray

I feel more comfortable going out in public again and holding conversations, whereas that felt impossible before starting Lexapro. I still have work I need to do outside of just taking Lexapro and expecting it to change my life, but it's given me the motivation  to help myself and not feel miserable in the process.

I'm on week 5, and I feel like it's helping more and more each day with anxious, obsessive thoughts and the down moods.

When I talked to my doctor about my mental health before he prescribed this I was a lot more anxious than depressed. As I started taking it, it helped a lot. Not only I noticed a difference, but everyone around me also did, saying how much more outgoing I was, and I was. It helped with my anxiety and my depression wasn’t a big issue, but as I continued to take it, my depression slowly got worse and worse. I eventually stopped going to school and missed like 3 months worth of classes, being in college this was terrible, considering most classes only allow 3-5 absences for an entire semester. Needless to say, my grades went downhill causing me to fall deeper into my depression and never leave my house. Eventually I stopped taking it and while I’m still depressed and anxious, it’s not as bad as the Lexapro made it. So I’d say for anxiety, it was a great medication, but depression wise it was absolutely terrible.",km

My anxiety months ago started to get away from me due to a family stress event. I have dealt with anxiety in the past so it’s not new for me but this time it was getting out of control. My worries were non stop and sleep wasn’t happening. So I started Lexapro beginning of April. By the 3 rd week I was getting good relief from my anxiety.  By week 6 I was back to me. :)So hang in there. It takes time but it worked for me. And I very much hope it works for you. Anxiety is debilitating. And hard for others to understand.

What a difference honestly I felt normal and could take on anything. I do believe in lifestyle change: I started 3 months ago to lose weight and I have lost 10 lbs so far. That’s because I pushed myself but was still miserable. It really is reprogramming your mind, but with the THC withdrawals Lexapro definitely saved me. Eventually I would like to get off it but it’s saving me a lot of trouble with suffering. Plus, it’s giving me so much confidence and NO more social anxiety.

It's helpful to have a prescription for Ativan or Xanax on standby to get through any panic attacks during the startup period. When it does kick in, there isn't a ""wow, I feel amazing!"" moment. More ""wow, I don't feel awful anymore.""",pwordtx

I toughed it out, and after about 6 weeks, it was like a cloud was lifted and I have felt AMAZING ever since.

I've been taking Lexapro 10mg for almost 4 months now and I can confidently say the only scary thing about this medication is people's negative reviews on it. First and foremost EVERYONE is different, so everyone will react to it differently. I was prescribed it by my primary Doctor due to my severe anxiety and mild depression. Before this medication I was prescribed Celexa, but hated it. My anxiety and depression got so much worse I decided to do something about it. It came to the point where my anxiety and depression affected everyone around me and I just wasn't happy anymore.  At first taking this medication gave me some side affects. My side effects were really dry mouth, some intense dreams, and some loss of appetite. The only thing that has stuck for these few months have been the dreams. They seems SO REAL! But I can say I rather have some dreams than those scary anxiety attacks I use to get, and those depressed bed sobs. Lexapro has changed my life! Before this medication my life was hitting rock bottom. My Anxiety was so severe it took over my life. I obsessed over everything, overthought everything, felt like at any moment I was going to die. I was on edge every second. My blood pressure was always high and I'm only 24! I had this obsession of dying in a car accident, it came to a point I couldnt ride in a car with anyone else unless I was driving. If I did I would get panic attacks. My depression was also bad and also had an eating disorder. I felt like I was never going to be happy. Was never going to be happy in a relationship, or in my job, or even be able to hug my own mother again. I'm happy the people in my life noticed how much my disorders were taking over my life and helped me make a change. Lexapro helped my life. I hope my review will change yours.",Kimmybabyy1991

I took it for another 4-5 days every day in 2.5-10mg to try with different dosage. The positive impact faded and I got serious problems with side effects.

Even doing the smallest tasks (paying bills) would cause an overwhelming amount of anxiety.Now (after 4 weeks on 10 mg)- I'm mellow, feel confident. Someone I just met pegged me as an intellect!

I have always had bad nerves , but when my daughter graduated high school, I was suffering from the ""empty nest syndrome"". Lexapro really helped me alot and the only fall back for me was my weight gain. I went from size 10 to 16 . I am going off from the medicine now and I think that I will do okay and if I ever have to go back on something it would be this. Good Luck!",Anonymous

The panic attacks went away completely and my anxiety was lessened. I am no longer walking around with a constant lump in my stomach and I feel stable. I had chest pains from the anxiety and they also went away after a month on Lexapro. If you experience side effects in the beginning please try to stick it out it is worth it. I had some side effects (restlessness, insomnia, worsening of panic episodes, dry mouth and sweating) but they went away after 4 weeks. The only bad thing about Lexapro is the weight gain. I gained 12 lbs in 2 months. Recently I had to up my dose to 15mg, when my dad died and I started feeling anxious again. Good luck all.",Anonymous

About 3 years ago (age 29) I began to have anxiety and panic attacks after a vet visit with my cat. I seizured from the anxiety of being in the vet office and from then on for about a year the anxiety turned into panic attacks at work, meetings, car, home. It wasn't until I finally had a full on panic attack (felt like a heart attack) and had to go to hospital that I was prescribed Lexapro. I did not want to accept the fact that I needed to take medicine for something psychological. I always tried to fight things with my mind. Over the past 2 years I am glad I was prescribed Lexapro. It has completely changed my anxiety. I still have occasionall anxiety but no attacks. Main side effect was low sex drive.",Anonymous

That being said, in my opinion it did more for my un-diagnosed depression then for my diagnosed anxiety, which is the reason for the perscription. I did rate this product a 9/10 though, because like I said it seems to be a great anti-depressant.",jayzee

I was less aggravated at the little things that go wrong in daily life.  My 5 and 6 year olds even noticed a difference.  It took about 3 weeks to start feeling better.  I decided that I did not need it anymore and could control the anxiety.  The withdrawls were bad with stopping cold turkey.  After 8 months off, I am getting back on medication.  The only bad side affect is terrible weight gain. ",M Boone 7

It does make me a bit sleepy so I take it before bed. My appetite is more normal now where I would eat to feel better now I am only eating when I'm hungry.
