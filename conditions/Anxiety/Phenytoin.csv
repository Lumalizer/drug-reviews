0,Phenytoin,Anxiety,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 2, 2020",4,"I first learned about Dilantin for anxiety and depression in the book, A Remarkable Medicine Has Been Overlooked. It worked for me, and I could feel the results in 45 minutes just as reported in the above mentioned book. It's an old tried and true medication, and I would recommend that you try it if you have anxiety or depression.",Me
1,Phenytoin,Anxiety,7,,"March 25, 2010",44,"Dilantin (phenytoin):My doctor prescribed Dilantin for anxiety and depression.  It seems to work just about 60 to 70% of the time for both conditions.  Other times I can't really tell the difference.  I use 1 or 2 - 100 mg Capsule(s) a day or only as needed.  I like that it is not habit forming and tolerance is not built up.  Side effects need to be looked at, although I don't experience any serious adverse effects.  Extra Vitamin B-12 and Folic Acid needs to be taken while taking Dilantin because it may cause a deficiency with these nutrients.",Frank20
