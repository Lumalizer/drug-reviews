0,Alprazolam,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 30, 2022",0,"This brand of alprazolam is awful. Got my prescription for this month and I could tell the difference right away from last month's script that was the same brand, (aurobindo). Some of them work fine, some of them won't not work at all. I called the pharmacy and even spoke with the owner of the pharmacy. I was told they cannot control the quality of them. I asked if I could get one of the better generic brands, like Sandoz or Greenstone and they can't get them because their wholesaler doesn't carry them. I have used my pharmacist for a very long time and I'm having to change pharmacies because of this company. They probably make them overseas more than likely. I strongly DO NOT recommend this brand of alprazolam to anyone suffering from anxiety.",Anxiety Patient
1,Alprazolam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 30, 2022",0,"Xanax (alprazolam):I have been on Xanax for good 15 years, started with 0.5mg for sleep or as needed from my regular doctor, my blood pressure was always high was always shy about having phobia about not being able to pee if there was someone else in public bathroom and stuff. I was always embarrassed about it but finally after a while I've had heart Holter all my body parts checked out and they pretty much it's from anxiety. I saw psychiatrist he doubled my Xanax still 0.5mg and Zoloft that I didn't take cuz would give me diarrhea.  I changed few doctors, have pretty good insurance and finally found a real cool new family doctor who was ok to give me 1mg 2x a day few years later I went to see him about 10 days early told him my anxiety is so bad, money is always short just so much stress so he decided to up me to 2mg which is nice and yea but still I wish I could take it 3x a day I usually split them in halves or quarters. I always get super stressed out when I'm low on them by end of the month.",Mike
2,Alprazolam,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 23, 2022",0,"I've been on Xanax since I was about 19 years old. Tolerance to the effects if taken over time are minimal if you're on a therapeutic dose. I find every bit the initial relief I obtained albeit with a slightly higher dose and this is after bout 20 years (on 4mg/day). If anything the only diminishment of effects are of the negatives.Withdrawal is very bad... if this is a thing you are overly worried about, I understand. For me, if I hadn't been on either Klonopin or Xanax I am sure I'd be dead. I had tried a couple times before finally getting a psych appointment... I'm 37 now.",Chrisrhudy

6,Alprazolam,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 16, 2022",3,"Xanax (alprazolam):It worked great for a little while and then tolerance came on very quickly. The Dr  kept upping the dose until I was on the maximum daily dosage, then after that I started having inter-dose withdrawals because of the extremely short half life. When I finally said enough is enough, and tried to quit, I ended up in the hospital intensive care and then in the psych ward strapped down to a bed. I had hallucinations and paranoia for weeks even on a taper schedule (I've never had any kind of hallucinations or schizophrenia in my entire life before this). It's been a couple years now and while some of the damage has gone away and healed, my brain and body is permanently damaged and will never be the same. If you are going to take this drug, please only use it on occasion maybe no more than once or twice a week. Or try to get on a benzodiazepine like valium or ativan which has a longer half life. I wish I could go back in time and save myself from the torture I've gone through.",Can ng
7,Alprazolam,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 10, 2022",0,"Someday someone will figure out why benzos as a whole rewire your brain to the point that you are worse than before you started if you try and quit. I was prescribed this drug by a sleep doctor and I was told nothing about its effects. I stayed on the low dose for over five years until I started to experience tolerance withdrawal, where I would get anxiety until I would take my sleeping dose. I spoke with my Dr. about it and was told to just stop taking it because I was on such a low dose. BIG MISTAKE. I was basically incapacitated for a week while I tried to wait it out. Constant horrific anxiety that left me unable to leave the house, unable to eat, barely able to care for myself. I ended up going back on and working with a Dr. to medically withdraw. The process took months and I still ended up with about 1.5 years of panic attacks, agoraphobia and extreme general anxiety. I had to go on disability for my work and eventually leave.",multi year user

9,Alprazolam,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 20, 2022",0,Xanax (alprazolam):I've been taking xanax for pretty much the past 5 years. I'm sure it's been longer than that but the past 2 years (more or less) I've been sticking to 1mg a day sometimes 2 if my anxiety becomes unbearable after midday. So far 1mg still does what it's intended to do. Maybe it doesn't have that extra kick to it that it had the first week of taking it but it still keeps my anxiety at bay. Just because you don't feel that euphoria that you did at first doesn't mean it's not working anymore. It's easier said than done but if you can bring some control to your mind you don't really have to worry about taking higher doses and becoming that dependent to it. Also I avoid taking it if I'm gonna be at home and not out at work or having fun (I have social anxiety with agoraphobia) seeing as I'll be comfortable on my home without the ¿fear? of socializing,Texan Dude
10,Alprazolam,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 1, 2022",1,"Alprazolam is the medication my doctor and I settled on to treat my generalized anxiety. My script is PRN but allows for 1mg to 4mg a day. Unlike some others, I've not had issues with withdrawal despite several years of use at this same dose and taking prolonged breaks from time to time. I've also never felt a desire to raise the dose. The most notable side effect is a reduction in mental dexterity while the drug is active, which returns once metabolized. Incidentally, this is why I prefer alprazolam over diazepam given the latter has a much longer half-life, since day-long cognitive interference is just too disruptive when tending to work or creative endeavors.",CheshireCat47

My big mouth causes me to spew out things I frequently regret. It was three months stress doing the move and then a year now living where I do not want to live. I wanna go home, but can't. That plus COVID, plus teaching a new course, online teaching, new friends, new house, new environment, all at age 72. So my Alprazolam increased to five  0.5mg a day with once weekly, and occasionally twice weekly therapy from my savior psychiatrist who tells me not to be concerned about the quantity. Yet I am functioning at a very high level making new friends and teaching brilliantly!!!! ALL because of Alprazolam. At this point I am back down to three  0.5 mg a day.

I ended up married to a mentally abusive spouse who caused PTSD  and an irrational fear of answering phone calls, listening to voice mail, and driving home from work.Recently, I was diagnosed with cancer, requiring several surgeries and doctor visits. This is when doctors noticed abnormal fluctuations in my blood pressure and heart rate. After some time observing, and after another blood pressure spike in the infusion center, I was prescribed xanax 1mg up to 2 times a day as needed. It has only been a few weeks but taking 1mg before a known anxious situation has made me feel almost like I did before the abusive marriage. I still have a bit of phone phobia, but I feel like I could go to the store alone without issue. I can listen to voice mails and my pulse no longer races. I have a feeling of calm and well being.

After a few years, hearing about the addiction potential I dropped it to .05 a night, which still worked.  About ten years ago I was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and started using the CPAP device so I would not be woken up by episodes of breathlessness.  I could then cut the usage to .0125.

Most of the time the pills did exactly what they were meant to do it's only recently, I was dropped to 60 a month and different pills... (went from the yellow to the GG256 white bars) idk whether it's in my head or I've been taking them for so long that my body is used to these new pills. But sometimes they will work for me and other times I will gain absolutely no benefit from taking them which is quite odd for me. I truly wish I could switch back to the yellow bars but my Walgreens only carries the whites even tho the place I was getting the yellow ones from was also a Walgreens, so now I've dropped 30 pills a month prescription wise, and I'm also not getting the same relief that I was on the other brand",Justin1001
21,Alprazolam,Anxiety,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 8, 2021",5,Xanax (alprazolam):I was given a small script of 0.5 alprazolam tablets to try. After a panic attack.Which I suffer from.Compared to 1mg Lorazepam or 0.5mg of Clonazepam.I found it closer to Lorazepam. With its effects being felt faster. But with more sedation and confusion. Alprazolam and its effects left faster than Lorazepam. It was harder to stay on 1 dose daily.I can see the advantage of rapid onset. But there are other benzodiazepines that leave your system more gradually and so you will have less rebound anxiety or other side effects taking a different benzodiazepine.

22,Alprazolam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 26, 2021",2,"Literally the holy grail of anxiety medication! The first time I took Xanax (at 0.25mg), my anxiety just melted away. My best friend was talking about how his friend got into a horrific accident, and I was not phased at all. I remember smiling like an idiot walking around his block the rest of the day. Just don't take too much or you will blackout. I also sleep really well with these. And of course, don't abuse these drugs. Please only take these drugs when you feel a panic attack coming on (or if your anxiety is super debilitating that day). I will say, tolerance builds VERY quickly. I don't get ""high"" off Xanax like I did when I was new to it. It either helps me fall asleep (or sends me to sleep) or it gets of rid a panic attack like nobody's business. If you're looking to get ""high,"" stick to cannabis, and if you suffer from insomnia, take an OTC like Unisom. Xanax is not a very good drug long-term for insomnia/rec. use.",zasderfght

I stopped driving for 5 years because I would get drop attacks in the car. I stopped going outside . It completely made me a vegetable. I couldn’t swallow I could not breath. 5 years later and I finally have driven a car thanks to tramadol. Tramadol saved my life. But Xanax is the worst drug!!!!  Do not take it!! Bad bad bad consequences. I promise you. I have been in  Xanax groups of people going through exactly what I did . Countless suicides from it because people didn’t have resources and didn’t understand what was happening. Thank god for my husband. It’s a withdrawal unlike anything. Worse than any opioid. Opioid withdrawal is like flu symptoms for couple months. This is more like a vegetable for YEARS! All those years I LOST!,Sunny022

On one hand, it is a very fast acting drug, and seems to be more ""powerful"" than klonopin at the same dosage (0.5mg).

So if I take anything other than the Xanax or generic form it does me way wrong. This medicine has saved my life. Does anyone think that the green 1mg is worse than the blue 1mg or is it just me? Does anyone else have a heart defect or afib that is treated with this medication? Also I have been taking this medication 12 plus years. My doctor will not raise the dosage and when my heart rate is over 248bpm it takes 2mg to make it go down to 140 to 150. Can anyone help or at least let me know if you are in my situation?

This case it gets a 10/10. You should not take this medication long term (3 months max) or overuse Xanax or any benzodiazepine.

(There's also a ""high"" that you get at the higher doses, but it quickly fades with ongoing use.) A significant problem with Xanax and all others benzos is the amotivational symptoms that results from chronic use. It certainly becomes increasingly hard to perform basic tasks, as one feels TOO relaxed to get anything done. Even more serious of a problem with Xanax in particular is its rebound effects that make the symptoms WORSE than before. Because Xanax is so powerful but short-acting, within just a couple, or maybe a few, hours of taking it, one feels the URGENT, overwhelming need to take more. It can quickly form dependence.

Xanax was made for 14 day use for acute crisis but is grossly misprescribed.

You believes the feeling is anxiety and take another pill to treat it! However the feeling is just withdrawal. You will need more and more of the drug just to get the original effects and you will not really be aware of how you’re acting. The longer you take the drug the worse it gets- and eventually the doctor who got you hooked on it will stop prescribing it.A safe way to get off of Xanax is the Ashton method  (BenzodiazepinesHow They Work & How to Withdraw)- switching slowly from Xanax to Valium.

In prison they will only give med's to people detoxing from alcohol or benzo's.  Bc it can kill you! Short term, stressful event like flying or giving a speech or a panic attack- will do you good.  Try not taking your Xanax for a few days and see how you feel?  Or run out of your prescription a few days early. Let me say..its not fun.  Please be responsible and try meditation or working out.

For cases of social anxiety, I recommend one to take alprazolam, 2 hours before social interaction.
