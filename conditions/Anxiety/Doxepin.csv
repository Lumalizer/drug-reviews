0,Doxepin,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 11, 2021",1,"25mg 3x a day as needed.Takes the edge off, of acute anxiety, but only modestly reduces the constant background anxiety 'buzzing'.",Iskra1908
1,Doxepin,Anxiety,3.0,,"July 16, 2021",3,"Before, I was taking amitriptyline for depression/anxiety & it worked in just 2 weeks. I was completely depression/anxiety free for the first time in 7 years. I didn't want to stop taking amitriptyline as it worked WAY better than the countless SSRI's I tried in the past, but sadly amitriptyline raised my resting heart rate way too high (a common side effect of amitriptyline). So I switched to doxepin which I hoped would be similar to amitriptyline as doxepin is also an older TCA type of antidepressant, but doxepin for me was a disaster. It gave me really bad nightmares & extreme vivid dreams. It also caused me to have a headache almost all the time I was taking it. It also caused a heavy sedation feeling when taking each tablet (I took 50mg each night) & all that aside, it didn't work well enough on my depression/anxiety.  I have switched to citalopram now, & those side effects have gone and I'm doing ok, so will stick with citalopram. Doxepin suits some people so good luck if you try it",JColley
2,Doxepin,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 1, 2021",5,"I’ve been on sinequan  for 26 years, I take 50 mg in the morning plus 1 1/2 Xanax,In the afternoon I take the same,And at night I take 3 sineqan (50g each) plus 2 Xanax & 2 imovane 7.5mg to help me sleep, and I wake normal (no side effects whatsoever) I can’t live without them, I highly recommend Sinequan  is the best  antidepressant  !!!!",Parapett
3,Doxepin,Anxiety,10.0,,"June 13, 2021",44,"I have suffered from anxiety, depression, eating disorders, sleep issues since my teens. I began doxepin in combination with hydroxyzine and I have experienced life changing results. I used to sleep 12 hours I would still be exhausted. My cognitive function is amazing. I no longer feel sick all the time, I wake up completely alert instead of groggy and in physical pain. The hydroxyzine has been very effective when I begin to notice myself getting over stimulated during the day. My anxiety essentially turns down to normal which has been a game changer for me. Fears that had been extremely taxing on me mentally and physically due to excessive anxiety and irregular sleep and eating are easy now. I used to crumble under pressure, procrastinate everything rather than just doing it... I am frankly blown away by the results. I feel normal for the first time in my life.",Neverwithouthope
4,Doxepin,Anxiety,9.0,,"June 2, 2021",8,"I have been suffering with anxiety, depression and insomnia, but doxepin helped me to get my life back. Thank you for those who created this medicine. My concern is how long will I take this medicine? Is this going for life? I am thinking to ask my doctor. It really helped to relieve anxiety and depression. I take right in the bed and it works good.9/10",Kgebriel

6,Doxepin,Anxiety,10.0,,"April 23, 2021",33,"I’m taking 10mg doxepin in the evening.  This is an older medicine that came out in 1969, this means that it has been around a long time and so what side effects there are, are largely known by now. I opted for the 10mg since 3mg & 6mg (for insomnia) is expensive. I have suffered with anxiety & insomnia for a few years now.  The higher mg’s (150mg-300mg) target areas of the brain affected by depression and anxiety (per MD). The 10mg has helped both with my insomnia & anxiety.  I have taken many different medicines to deal with my anxiety.  I was having insomnia with Celexa & had to take Xanax to deal with it, it worked aside from insomnia.  I have struggled for a long time to find something that actually works & I am grateful that I am able to sleep & be free of anxiety!  I read the reviews on doxepin prior to taking it & saw several that said it caused them to gain weight.  This has not been my experience.  I’ve had no side effects &, best of all, I’ve gotten my life back.",Pmillz0704
7,Doxepin,Anxiety,10.0,,"January 8, 2021",39,"I was on doxepin a while ago but weaned myself off it, thinking my anxiety wasn't that bad and I could try mindfulness/natural herbs. Well that wasn't a good idea. Ended up in hospital with heat arrhythmia and terrible anxiety/no sleep. I didn't realise how well this medication works while on it. After 2 days back on it I'm sleeping and my heart has gone back to normal. I'm on 75mg and will be for life. I have had no unpleasant side effects apart from going off it. Saved my life really. 10/10",Ang
8,Doxepin,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 16, 2020",33,"After most of my life at least 40 Years. I have been on tricyclic antidepressants it took a long time to get diagnosed I see my condition as generalised anxiety as I had no real classic signs of depression, 10 years ago I enede up in Hospital and they gave me anti psychotic medications seraquel nothing worked. After giving me xanax which within an hour I was back to myself they discharged me on xanax.  I saw my psychiatrist of 20 years and he prescribed Doxepin and within 4 week I came literally out of a nightmare.  I still have 2 hour to come round in the morning but it sure is better than the extreme anxiety and worry I was experiencing. So I don't  want to upset the apple cart as I have so I continue to keep up my regime and I'm quite pleased with have a life without extreme anxiety panic disorder which is my exact diagnosis.",Marco

10,Doxepin,Anxiety,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 2, 2020",10,"Prescribed doxepin 25mg for anxiety and I was afraid to take the whole dose. I’ve divided into 1/2, 2/3 and into 1/4. The 1/4 didn’t make me feel hungover or very tired the next day but the other does did. I’m glad I didn’t try the full does. I do sleep better and don’t have the hangover, dizziness or feel tired. The lower dose just takes the edge off my anxiety. I’ll give it another week then decide if it’s for me.",Rae

12,Doxepin,Anxiety,1.0,,"January 25, 2020",10,"Today is day one- Took my first dose of Doxepin 25 mg last night. Woke up feeling very very depressed and VERY angry. I am ready to punch someone in the face and I haven’t even left my house yet today. I was just taking this for insomnia, but I am stopping this medication and calling my doctor because I can’t be cursing people out or punching them or being  angry for no reason. I screamed at and hung up on my boyfriend about an hour ago when he didn’t even do anything at all except interrupt me to remind me of something. Thank goodness he is understanding about what is going on and isn’t upset. Not to mention my thoughts are clustered and I only slept for 4 hours last night. So no, this stuff did not help me at all. It really messed me up. I’d rate this medication a NEGATIVE 10 if that were possible, but unfortunately this website makes me she was between 1 and 10 only, so I was forced to choose 1.",QBaBoy

14,Doxepin,Anxiety,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 11, 2019",8,"A dermatologist put me on Doxepin because she thought my skin problems might be caused by anxiety. I took it at night; when I got up in the morning, I was so dizzy I had to hold on to walls and furniture to keep from falling! I felt kind of drunk all day; not good for people who have a job and/or other responsibilities. Oh well, my dermatological problems weren't caused by anxiety anyway. I gave this drug a 3 rating because it seems like it would be effective as a sleep aid and to reduce anxiety.",Diana
15,Doxepin,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2019",48,"Been on doxepin 10mg for insomnia and anxiety attacks. In only three days it has changed my quality of life for the better. I take it at 9pm, and I’m asleep by 10:30 or 11pm the latest. I sleep all night. I do feel a little groggy in the morning but it goes away after an hour of moving around. It keeps me centered and functional throughout the day. No anxiety, or panic. It has relieved my palpitations too. A bit of a dry mouth but my pharmacist suggested I drink water or suck on ice cubes. It relieves the dry mouth. I was put on sertraline 50mg and buspirone before this and that combo totally messed me up. They caused me mild serotonin syndrome (rapid heart rate and high blood pressure). I’m so glad my doctor put me on doxepin. It has helped so much! I will not touch sertraline or buspirone ever again.",Anon05
16,Doxepin,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 8, 2019",25,"This drug doxepin has definitely decreased my anxiety and panic attacks. After years of trying nearly every drug out there, I've finally found one that works well (for me). The one downside I have with this drug is the grogginess in the mornings. However, I've been running in the morning to help ease the grogginess and it certainly helps.",BrianB

20,Doxepin,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 16, 2019",24,"I started on doxepin 75 mg 15 days ago. I have notice a decrease in my anxiety, excitableness, and obsessive thinking and thoughts.  I use to have a problem sleeping. Not anymore!! I am asleep in about 20 min and I stay asleep. I use to be such a light sleeper, and never got more than 5 hours of sleep. I use to take Gabapentin for nerve pain. However, I haven’t needed it since taking Doxepin. I noticed it also takes my appetite away.  Now for the horrible side effects.....I have to force myself up. It takes me a few hours to fully be awake. I was in a horrible brain fog for the first 10 days. The first four days I felt like I had the flu. Now I am still dealing with the tiredness. I don’t want to stop it. However, I will if the tiredness doesn’t subside. I am glad I have had no headaches on the medicine, as other meds have given me.",Anonymous

23,Doxepin,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 27, 2018",78,"I’ve been struggling with PTSD for well over 10 years. Incapacitating anxiety, insomnia, depression. I could no longer function at all. I’ve tried everything! Nothing worked unless it made it worse and gave me extremely bad side effects. It was so excruciating that I really wanted to throw in the towel. I started Doxepin about 6 or weeks ago. Then suddenly the intensity of my disorder severely decreased. Almost overnight and has continued to without any dips in its time. I’m absolutely stunned! I’m still on the low starting dose too. I’m overjoyed by relief. I’ve become myself again. I can actively participate in daily activities like showering, leaving my house, answering the phone, basic things that people take for granted. Before, I was totally immobilized. I hope this continues",Mary
24,Doxepin,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 2, 2017",21,"Started on Doxepin 100mg January 2017 due to debilitating GAD and panic attacks. I was miserable. Ten minutes after waking up, the panic attacks would start. I quit going out in public as much as possible. At night, I couldn't shut my mind off, which exasperated my insomnia. I was taking more Xanax than prescribed to try to get through the day. I specifically asked my psych for this based on reviews. Helped right away with sleep (with no next day grogginess for me), and after about a week, started putting the brakes on my anxiety. Slowly noticed I was getting parts of my life back. It served its purpose and pretty darn well, but in ten months I gained 30lbs and kept gaining.  Due to the ongoing weight gain I switched to gabapentin instead.",BBP007

26,Doxepin,Anxiety,10.0,,"October 10, 2017",21,"I have suffered with severe anxiety and panic attacks, which manifested itself into not sleeping.  I literally stopped sleeping for several days.  Ended up in the ER a couple times and at the doctors all that week and finally had to be admitted to a mental health facility because nothing they were giving me was working.   I literally thought I was going to die.  After 9 days they finally found something that helped me sleep.   It was a combination of Doxepin 100mg, Xanax, Tramadol (which soon switched to Benadryl)  and Ambien.  These drugs gave me my life back and slowly restored my sleep cycle.  After a year or so I was weaned off the Ambien and then the Benadryl, so now I just take the Xanax & Doxepin (now lowered to 50mg).  Amazing.",righton2

28,Doxepin,Anxiety,9.0,,"September 24, 2017",31,Hi milemile I have been on doxepin many years for panic attacks before this medicine I stopped going out anywhere. You will be tired for a bit of time but it goes away . It stopped all panic attacks. Never had one panic attack for 10 years on this medicine. But I stopped to try other meds for higher mood.  But when I stopped doxepin the panic attacks returned so 10 years without panic attack on doxepin is a good thing!,No panic

30,Doxepin,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 25, 2017",52,"I started doxepin last night and I have insomnia and wake up several times during the night. I slept from 6:30pm til 7:30am, but still a little tired today, but I didn't wake up once. So, so far so good. I think I'm going to be very pleased with this drug. It also helped a lot with my anxiety as well. I've had zero side effects so far and hopefully won't have any. Good luck to everyone that takes it cuz for me after trying several meds, this seems to be the best one so far and without weight gain too. Most insomnia medication causes weight gain from the research I've done and this one doesn't thank god because I've just lost 110lbs and do not want to put any weight on now that I'm at my perfect weight size for my height.
