It was so bad that I was ready to end it till finally one day at the emergency room a doctor gave me 1 mg of this magical drug. It's the only thing that's ever stopped anxiety and panic and it truly saved my life. I've been prescribed it ever since and I only take it very very seldomly like maybe 10 times in the last 4 years just having the medicine next to me is almost enough to make you fight it off yourself even though I'm in another very bad episode I still have not taken it but it truly does save lives",Stickingwithit
4,Lorazepam,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 31, 2022",0,"As a male in my late 20s and a healthy BMI, my doctor prescribed a trial of this for treatment of generalized anxiety to test its potential efficacy while we sought to establish which, if any, of the benzodiazepines best treated my symptoms. I was absolutely bulletproof to lorazepam. I tried it on a few separate occasions and felt no affect. I then performed a test. I took a dose (1mg) and waited 45 minutes to an hour. When no affect was experienced I then took another. I repeated this process over the span of an afternoon. Even so, there was still no effect. I was not sedated, no less anxious, and experienced no cognitive impact or affect on coordination. I can only hope if I ever need a medical procedure requiring sedation, the doctors do not use lorazepam.",CheshireCat

Big mistake.Her GP prescribed 0.5 up to 1mg of Lorazepam.0.5 did nothing.So we went to 1mg.Omg.She had what I can only describe as a manic episode coupled with rage and tears and wanting to talk for hours. This was 7 days ago and its now thrown her out even more...she could only cope with her OCD to a point NOW that's gone out the window. She is in a continual loop of emotional dysregulation and doesn't know what to do....e.g...she gets upset now over the smallest thing and it triggers increased OCD compulsions and she's stuck, utterly helpless and frustrated and can't stop the intrusive feelings and thoughts. She blames the meds completely.",Sarah Lund

I still am not back to my normal self and due to the memory loss/lack of sleep/overall issues with basic life tasks. It's been causing me major anxiety/frustration/every emotion under the sun. My doctor put me on Lorazepam for 10 days,  ten days only to help sleep. My doctor didn't want me to stay on it because this can be an addictive drug. I didn't think it was an issue. It did what it was supposed to do. It was 0.5mg and it did help me sleep. The first night I took it, I noticed a lot of heavy/chest deep breathing but the other 10 days I was fine. It was the withdrawal for me which why I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. I do not drink/smoke/do drugs. I DO NOT have an addictive personality. The first day off of this thing... I cried and cried and cried. So emotional. The littlest things bothered me. I was shaky and irritable. Took everything out on everyone else. Would much rather take something else.",must read-

8,Lorazepam,Anxiety,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 1, 2022",0,"Lorazepam is good for a long time treatment. It is not too strong so your personality does not change too much. For example Clonazepam, Nitrazepam, Flurazepam and Flunitrazepam, that nearly isn't prescribed any more since it is BtmG [The Betäubungsmittelgesetz (BtMG), generally meaning Narcotics Law, is the controlled-substances law of Germany] are on the opposite sidet. Flunitrazepam is in the same class like Morphine since 2 years. Before that it was prescribed too much and now you don't get it if you need it. Besides it is just a little change that could be presented to the public as a war against miss use. They just forget to  mention that other benzo just need a normal prescription and make as addicted as Flunitrazepam. It was the most wanted but now there are still all other benzo. I hope they keep it that way because if all become BtmG I would not know what to do.",Delysid

I had a terrible bout of anxiety after an illness years ago and I was unable to eat anything for weeks due to extreme stomach pain.  If I wasn’t prescribed Ativan I don’t know if I would have survived.  I don't that benzos have such a stigma, but for those living with anxiety and all the terrible things that come along with it, it can make living so much better.  At my highest anxiety I was taking 3 mg/day.  I could finally eat and get through the day without pain.  When I am not having issues I take 0.5mg at night to sleep.  If I don’t have it for more than 24 hours I can tell because I will wake up in the middle of the night with anxiety.  I don’t love the fact that it is so addictive, but I don’t know where I would be without it.",Anonymous
10,Lorazepam,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 26, 2021",0,"Ativan (lorazepam):I initially took this drug to treat chronic nerve pain, as nothing else would work. This gave me some relief as I was experiencing continuous pain. I also suffer from anxiety and bipolar disorder.I believe this drug saved my life, even though it has actually worsen my anxiety. I take 1mg once a day in the morning, so that I would up the next morning with severe anxiety. It took me a long time to figure out this came from Ativan and not my ""normal"" anxiety, which wasn't that severe in the first place.As my neuralgia eventually got better over time, I tried to lower the dose to 0.5mg per day. I was prepared to experience withdrawal, but instead I felt as great as ever! I eventually went into a manic state and started to have psychotic symptoms.So bipolar people beware: stopping a long term use of Ativan can trigger a manic episode! Altogether I don't regret taking this drug as I have a more productive life and more desire for social connections.",Lucy
11,Lorazepam,Anxiety,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 8, 2021",0,"Ativan (lorazepam):This pill works, but is not a solution. Be wary even if you don’t have an addictive personality. I don’t, but using this only 3 days in a row, then stopped, caused me physical withdrawal symptoms! I only took 1mg each day. After 3 days, I had rebound anxiety, tense, painful shoulders and back,  neck/head pain, teeth grinding, and achy. Also, this medication makes my hair shed!! and makes me feel stupid and foggy for days after! This is definitely NOT a drug you want to play around with! My husband was prescribed this years ago, and he said also, he became dope sick after using just for a couple days! Withdrawal from Benzos can be really hard, so if you are trying to get off of them consult your physician. I couldn’t imagine how bad withdrawals would be if you were on these long term. I will keep them on hand for extreme, rare emergencies. But between time, I will stick to hypnosis and taking lemon balm or passionflower herbs.",Eur0trAsh
12,Lorazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 3, 2021",4,"Hospitalized for a bad auto accident about 30 years ago, I suffered insomnia, anxiety, and depression. My Doctor kept me in the hospital a little over a month trying various combinations of Rxs. He was very happy with the results from 1mg. lorazepam and 2 milligrams trifluoperazine. I have taken them up until 2020. The combo got me thru college with a 4.0 and eased life's dramas and traumas along the way. At the beginning of 2020 I weaned off both with my doctors help. I was never addicted and in fact took less than prescribed going by how my body/mind felt. Weaning off was not hard in anyway- I only take 1/2 mg. lorazepam if necessary.. and I'm finding it not to be. They saved my life! I use natural calmative's and practice healthy wellness alternatives. I would like you to note that over those 30 odd years- I had Doctors that wanted me to try the newest Rx 's - horrid side effects and cost way more... If it ain't broke don't fix it.",Kate Spade

If I'm feeling edgy or having a panic attack, I take 1mg and within 20-30 minutes I'm good for exactly 24 hours.  I would give it a 10, but you really have to take it sparingly and it can be habit forming.  I'd say it's good to take 3-6 times a month, and more frequently than that and you will have some withdrawal symptoms which can be unpleasant (muscle aches, constipation, more anxiety, etc.)  But that's just the nature of Benzos.

I take 1mg at night, if needed. My doctor prescribes me 20 at a time, and I usually refill every 4-5 months.

In a month I was down to .50 of lorazepam which my son insisted I have. I was given my original dose by a well respected physician. But he died. Doctors care more about their paperwork Than they do about people. I know what’s wrong. It’s been a nightmare 4 months . At my age and my years of taking Xanax, I should have been treated very differently. But I’m stuck. My doctor has all kinds of labels and new diagnosis for me. With different meds.

16,Lorazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 25, 2021",0,Lorazepam has made me a better person. It is the most effective and reliable medication for my anxiety/insomnia. There will always be people who abuse medications like this but if you take it only when needed and as prescribed it can be life changing. I love everything about this medication. I feel like me! I don’t feel high whatsoever just more calm and more relaxed. It helps me sleep but doesn’t make me zonk out. I take 1-1.5 when needed. I took 2 once during a bad panic attack and it made me extremely tired and sleep all night. Only use when you need it but I’ve found that 0.5-2 is a good dose range for me depending on the level of anxiety or insomnia.,Ilovemyson

When I first take this after a week of awful Ativan withdrawal it feels like literally heaven. I feel so calm and relaxed on this, no paranoia, more talkative and confident, happy and sometimes goofy. The effects last until later the next day. I LOVE this drug!

It lasts 8 full hours, meaning even if addicted. You are more likely to only have to take it twice a day vs a dependent Xanax users 4 times a day. As well as that it seems to be more steady a release, has less side effects than other benzo's and typically a patient only needs 1-2mg a day. (vs Xanax 4mg or 3mg of clonazepam). It's the most logical choice, and the best choice. Just make sure you have a steady supply and taper down when you'd like to stop.",AndrewM

I was still experiencing anxiety, tension and clenching my jaw at work, home and in my sleep, but Lorazepam Sub 0.5mg helped greatly. I was more relaxed at work, calmer in high pressure situations No clenching. Wasn't over-drowsy, just had a few yawns here and there. I could focus. But because they were Sublingual, they are short acting. 4 hours later, jaw clenching and tension, my hands were back to feeling shakey. Took another one. The 7 pills the walk-in doctor gave me didn't last long as a result. I have been waiting to see my GP. Appointment next week, but I saw the walk-in doctor again today and we determined that the regular (non-sublingual) would be a better option since its longer acting. Still at 0.5mg, no increase and I don't want an increase. If this is something which I take regularly with my escitalopram, I want to lowest possible dose.",CedarRose

I was basically given Ativan at the lowest dose .  1 tab up to 3-4 times a day if needed.  It was prescribed for me for anxiety in dealing with the day to day frustration of dealing with my injuries, helped with pain and I sometimes used one at bedtime because I had trouble sleeping. I never used it every day or more than 2 a day. It really helped me if needed, unfortunately when the world decided to go stupid nuts with pain medicine addiction the doctors stopped the Ativan.  I wish they hadn’t done that because now I don’t sleep and have serious anxiety.  But yes it worked for me perfect!  Unfortunately many abuse it and ruined my life!

Over the past few years, there were times when I came SO close to missing flights.  My nervousness and flight anxiety would hit me in my gut at very inopportune times, such as RIGHT before boarding.  I LOVE flying, but can't stand taking off (and to a lesser extent, landing).  I think my flight anxiety really stems from the fact that I'm not in control, I'm relying on a big machine and someone else piloting that machine to get me from point A to point B thousands of feet above the ground.  There's nothing I can personally do except sit there.  So I finally tried Ativan, and I take a very low dosage shortly before flying.  It doesn't take my fear away, but it puts me in a ""zone"" where it's not completely consuming me.  I always have it on hand!",Modegirl79

You can use GABA powders to help the process along but not so many supplements that you over ride the process of healing.   I spent three months of tapering off of them.  I did not know they were habit forming till doing research on them years after starting.   Wouldn't be nice if the causes were addressed instead of drugged.,d

Yet, I have never in my life experienced the things I felt the following days after taking one single dose of Ativan.

46,Lorazepam,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 18, 2020",187,Ativan (lorazepam):This is a wonderful drug but should not be taken daily. I get ten pills per month. I take them when I have a bad bout of anxiety or insomnia etc. It resets me and stops the panic attack cascade that can happen from nights of insomnia. It parts the waves and allows me to pass through the difficulty. It can make you a little emotional after you stop if you take it a few days. I would not take it more than two or three consecutive days. It can be addictive. It can cause a little forgetfulness. For the most part I felt totally normal. It doesn’t have a weird affect it just takes away the gross fear. I’ve been taking .5-1mg several times per month for 5 years. I average 10 pills per month and have no issue stopping cold turkey. Benzos can be difficult to get off if you take them too frequently so beware.,Jen

I suffer from major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Ativan helps my anxiety immensely. Especially useful for full-blown panic attacks - within half an hour I feel normal again. At first it made me sleepy, but as my body got used to it, that side effect went away. There was a time when I was having debilitating anxiety on a daily basis, and my pdoc advised me that I could take up to 4 mg per day. Thankfully, I haven’t had the need to take that much.

I see many worried about addiction.  As with any of the many drugs that change a physiological function, our bodies can become up or down-regulated and normalize the presence of the drug. Any mammal reducing or discontinuing certain drugs, like Ativan, can experience dependence, characterized by physical and emotional distress at withdrawal. This is should NOT alone be considered ADDICTION. Addiction often involves dependence, but that's not all. If you discontinue Ativan and find yourself drinking uncharacteristically more, or pursuing other chemical ways to cope, you may have a valid addiction concern.  Phy./emo. dependence, is not the only criteria for AdXN. Dr's are generally accepting of this and should take no offence.

241,Lorazepam,Anxiety,9.0,,"February 25, 2017",5,I have anxiety and sleeping problems. I like Xanax a little better I think.  But Ativan still helps. Not from me because I haven't tried it yet but I heard if you like Xanax you have to double up on the Ativan from Xanax from 1mg to 2 and it would feel the same. That Ativan is weaker but has a longer shelf life. Regardless I would recommend this med out if you have sleeping problems or anxiety. There's usually a hard time for me to find a medium for me. I'm either too happy or to sad. Ativan n other benzo's give me that.,Tokeo

It has no side effects and is actually good for you!!! Its called L theanine. This is a amazing natural supplement for anxiety and phobias. Its 100% safe and it works better for me than lorazepam.

It does a great job of heading off a panic attack when you feel one coming on.  It works very quickly (5 minutes or less).  It doesn't make you feel drunk or high, but more just kind of relaxed and mellow (a bit sleepy).  I took a very low dose, as needed, and it's just nice to have something in case I need it, that wasn't real addictive or habit forming.  Like having a spare tire.  You don't have to use it very often, but it's comforting knowing you have one, and it will get you through.
