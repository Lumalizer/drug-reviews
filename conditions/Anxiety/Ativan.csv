2,Ativan,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 30, 2021",2,"I have been on Ativan in varying dosages for a few years now.  I had a terrible bout of anxiety after an illness years ago and I was unable to eat anything for weeks due to extreme stomach pain.  If I wasn’t prescribed Ativan I don’t know if I would have survived.  I don't that benzos have such a stigma, but for those living with anxiety and all the terrible things that come along with it, it can make living so much better.  At my highest anxiety I was taking 3 mg/day.  I could finally eat and get through the day without pain.  When I am not having issues I take 0.5mg at night to sleep.  If I don’t have it for more than 24 hours I can tell because I will wake up in the middle of the night with anxiety.  I don’t love the fact that it is so addictive, but I don’t know where I would be without it.",Anonymous
3,Ativan,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 26, 2021",0,"I initially took this drug to treat chronic nerve pain, as nothing else would work. This gave me some relief as I was experiencing continuous pain. I also suffer from anxiety and bipolar disorder.I believe this drug saved my life, even though it has actually worsen my anxiety. I take 1mg once a day in the morning, so that I would up the next morning with severe anxiety. It took me a long time to figure out this came from Ativan and not my ""normal"" anxiety, which wasn't that severe in the first place.As my neuralgia eventually got better over time, I tried to lower the dose to 0.5mg per day. I was prepared to experience withdrawal, but instead I felt as great as ever! I eventually went into a manic state and started to have psychotic symptoms.So bipolar people beware: stopping a long term use of Ativan can trigger a manic episode! Altogether I don't regret taking this drug as I have a more productive life and more desire for social connections.",Lucy
4,Ativan,Anxiety,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 8, 2021",0,"This pill works, but is not a solution. Be wary even if you don’t have an addictive personality. I don’t, but using this only 3 days in a row, then stopped, caused me physical withdrawal symptoms! I only took 1mg each day. After 3 days, I had rebound anxiety, tense, painful shoulders and back,  neck/head pain, teeth grinding, and achy. Also, this medication makes my hair shed!! and makes me feel stupid and foggy for days after! This is definitely NOT a drug you want to play around with! My husband was prescribed this years ago, and he said also, he became dope sick after using just for a couple days! Withdrawal from Benzos can be really hard, so if you are trying to get off of them consult your physician. I couldn’t imagine how bad withdrawals would be if you were on these long term. I will keep them on hand for extreme, rare emergencies. But between time, I will stick to hypnosis and taking lemon balm or passionflower herbs.",Eur0trAsh
5,Ativan,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 24, 2021",0,"Ativan works like a charm.  If I'm feeling edgy or having a panic attack, I take 1mg and within 20-30 minutes I'm good for exactly 24 hours.  I would give it a 10, but you really have to take it sparingly and it can be habit forming.  I'd say it's good to take 3-6 times a month, and more frequently than that and you will have some withdrawal symptoms which can be unpleasant (muscle aches, constipation, more anxiety, etc.)  But that's just the nature of Benzos.  Really great drug generally and happy to have access to it in a pinch.",Rick Dangerous
6,Ativan,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 4, 2021",0,"This honestly is one of the BESSSSST drugs out there besides Xanax and Valium. I’ve been taking 1mg since July 2018, it makes me feel soooooooo good!! Like a perfectly relaxed almost. I take this usually when I’m having fits of rage, anxiety, panicking or restless legs. When I first take this after a week of awful Ativan withdrawal it feels like literally heaven. I feel so calm and relaxed on this, no paranoia, more talkative and confident, happy and sometimes goofy. The effects last until later the next day. I LOVE this drug! Perfect 10/10, I would vote this a 12 or 13/10 if it had the option",Nicole96
7,Ativan,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 23, 2021",1,"Compared to other benzodiazepines, ativan is the best option for me. It lasts 8 full hours, meaning even if addicted. You are more likely to only have to take it twice a day vs a dependent Xanax users 4 times a day. As well as that it seems to be more steady a release, has less side effects than other benzo's and typically a patient only needs 1-2mg a day. (vs Xanax 4mg or 3mg of clonazepam). It's the most logical choice, and the best choice. Just make sure you have a steady supply and taper down when you'd like to stop.",AndrewM
8,Ativan,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 18, 2021",1,Ativan actually is the only medication that can help me get a control on my breathing. And it keeps me from going into panic attacks when I'm loosing control of my breathing.,Justin
9,Ativan,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 17, 2021",2,"I fly, on average, once every two months or so.  Over the past few years, there were times when I came SO close to missing flights.  My nervousness and flight anxiety would hit me in my gut at very inopportune times, such as RIGHT before boarding.  I LOVE flying, but can't stand taking off (and to a lesser extent, landing).  I think my flight anxiety really stems from the fact that I'm not in control, I'm relying on a big machine and someone else piloting that machine to get me from point A to point B thousands of feet above the ground.  There's nothing I can personally do except sit there.  So I finally tried Ativan, and I take a very low dosage shortly before flying.  It doesn't take my fear away, but it puts me in a ""zone"" where it's not completely consuming me.  I always have it on hand!",Modegirl79
10,Ativan,Anxiety,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 14, 2021",4,"I’ve been on 1 mg daily for almost 2 years. I wish I would have known how hard it is to get off of without tapering off slowly. If I miss a dose the rebound symptoms kick in and I’m left in pain, wondering if I’m going to have a grand mal seizure. I want off of this med but I’ll have to talk to my doctor about switching to a slow release to taper off of benzos. If you get prescribed, please only take a small amount for a short period of time. Get a good therapist to find ways to deal with anxiety on your own, this drug is just a bandaid.",Cenobyt3z

They assumed he was an alcoholic just  and he was having withdrawal from not being able to drink in hospital. On the 4 day and for 3 days later, couldn't talk, move on his own, or walk.

13,Ativan,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2021",58,"Well, I got an intense anxiety attack at 2 am and somehow went through it that very unfortunate night . But the following morning I got my hands on Ativan and when the anxiety kicked in again I popped 1mg Ativan and it kicked in within an hour and gradually getting stronger.  My heart rate slowed down which made me feel a lot better coz I thought I was gonna have a heart attack during my first anxiety attack . Made my mind more calmer and it put me off to sleep very peacefully only to wake up the next morning all fresh.  I love Ativan coz it really helps me with my anxiety attacks . I have a racing thoughts issue and it solves it too .I have been on it for a month and I quit it cold turkey when I went back home but I didn't face any major withdrawal symptoms too.

I’m in a constant fog and feel like my body is battling itself internally. I’m a zombie but can’t sleep, I feel like I took uppers and a tranquilizer at the same time. I have the body jerking side effect and when I tried to stop the meds I felt crazy. So I’m taking half and it was better for 2 days and now I’m in a fog again. I am not myself, I can’t function and work is nearly impossible. Helps anxiety but for me not worth it",New here
16,Ativan,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 18, 2020",187,This is a wonderful drug but should not be taken daily. I get ten pills per month. I take them when I have a bad bout of anxiety or insomnia etc. It resets me and stops the panic attack cascade that can happen from nights of insomnia. It parts the waves and allows me to pass through the difficulty. It can make you a little emotional after you stop if you take it a few days. I would not take it more than two or three consecutive days. It can be addictive. It can cause a little forgetfulness. For the most part I felt totally normal. It doesn’t have a weird affect it just takes away the gross fear. I’ve been taking .5-1mg several times per month for 5 years. I average 10 pills per month and have no issue stopping cold turkey. Benzos can be difficult to get off if you take them too frequently so beware.,Jen

For the past week I’ve been crying uncontrollably because of certain things going on and when people don’t show me any concern or comfort me I get irrationally angry and even chased my little sister for showing no sympathy. I’m a 23 year old woman and she’s a 16 year old girl so she’s got her own problems. I immediately took an Ativan and within 20 minutes they kicked in perfectly. I didn’t have an urge to cry anymore, I felt calm and relaxed, And kind of high and had a rational thought process. This is what effects Ativan usually has on me and sometimes I feel goofy and laugh at the most random things. But regardless I ❤️ This drug and couldn’t ask for better. I’ve been on clonazepam that’s ok but not as good as Ativan and I’ve been on Xanax once at the hospital but that made me even more anxious and my muscles jerked.

The effects kick in between 45 min and 2 hours and I feel extremely calm, happy, silly and even loopy.

21,Ativan,Anxiety,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 17, 2020",99,Ativan does the job. But you do NOT want to go through the withdrawal. It's very bad.I have generalized anxiety and panic disorder to the point where I can't leave the house unless I really have to. And ativan makes it a lot easier to leave the house.The withdrawal makes your anxiety come back with vengeance. It's bad.For the short term it's great but long term you become addicted and physically dependent on it. And you build a tolerance so it doesn't help you as much as initially taking it.I love ativan and recommend it to anyone suffering from anxiety. Just make sure you wean off it or you will feel like a life becomes a nightmare.,Drugs

24,Ativan,Anxiety,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 30, 2019",97,This is by far the scariest experience I have EVER had with a drug. Ativan immediately took the anxiety away but the after effects were horrible. I took it intermittently for 2 weeks and then noticed when I didn't take it consistently my anxiety was 100 percent worse. I was crawling out of my skin and so irritable. I also had uncontrollable muscle shaking and memory problems. This drug is very dangerous for some people. I'll stick to cognitive behavioral therapy.,Hs
25,Ativan,Anxiety,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2019",72,"I had been having extreme anxiety and panic attacks for 4 or 5 days and didn’t feel like I could handle them on my own anymore. I went to the ER and they gave me Ativan to calm down. I’m not sure what the dosage was but it was in pill form. At that point I had been crying non stop for 3 hours as I was very scared and my heart was beating very fast. Within half an hour or so I could feel the medication working as it took the edge off of my anxiety. When I went home I immediately fell asleep and stayed asleep. I also hadn’t been sleeping well so that was a relief. It worked really well for me, but I only took it at the ER and haven’t taken it consecutively as a prescription. The only downside was I felt very groggy and foggy the next couple of days, but that could be attributed to exhaustion. Overall it really helped me a lot.",Miss K

27,Ativan,Anxiety,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 17, 2019",73,I like Ativan better than valium but not xanax be careful on any benzodiazepines. They will mess with your brain up cause memory loss. I've been on them for 20 years. No way can I go off them now. I'm screwed. I tried twice and went insane. I kicked a 4 year opiate addiction with the help of suboxone and that was hard. Kicking benzos makes kicking opiates like candy. Trust me benzodiazepines  are dangerous. My Dr never warned me of the addiction until I switched drugs. About 5 years in. Isn't that nice? I live with them they keep me calm. I have very bad anxiety but knowing what I know now I would have took a shot of vodka a couple times a day. I'm not a drinker but it beats the side effects of benzos. Moderation is the key.,Jr

29,Ativan,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 21, 2019",81,"the doctor gave me Ativan for treating bad anxiety/panic attacks. I just take 1/2 of a 1mg pill when I’m experiencing a panic attack. (The doctor was very reluctant to prescribe it as it is a benzo) but in my opinion it is 100% better than the long term stuff which just completely messed up my moods and made me depressed which I never was before.  I keep the Ativan with me and if I start to feel a bad attack coming on I have 1/2 a pill and am completely fine again within 15 mins. It’s been a life saver for me as my panic attacks would sometimes last days and I’d be throwing up, the whole deal. Ativan has really helped, I’ve only had to use it twice in six months, but just knowing it’s there if I need it is great. The only side effect I get is drowsiness but usually I take it at night anyway so it’s good. I also get a lot of relief from cognitive behavioral therapy like tapping and meditating.",Happy customer

The .05 pills are gentle, they take the edge off. Things like alcohol, and opiates seem like they are WAY more addictive.  I had to deal with my mom who had a high stress job and was HORRIBLY addicted to Xanax, almost died taking them. I refused to take benzos my whole life for that reason until I just recently needed them due to a miscarriage. Will only use them as needed (during PMS) I had absolutely NO withdrawals or odd sensations the next day after taking. Have seen what benzos do to some people.

33,Ativan,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 29, 2019",69,I’ve done research as I suffer from anxiety I had a doctor prescribe me Xanax and from all I’ve read online they are almost identical to each other. I would rate Xanax much Lower than Ativan. Ativan truly cures anxiety and all I need is 1 pill for 3 days and I feel normal and functioning. Xanax makes you feel drunk and wake up with an anxious hangover. Must be my genetic make up but I highly prefer Ativan just do not abuse it. You must respect this medication,Zion
34,Ativan,Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 25, 2019",142,"I’ve been taking Ativan on an off for the past 9 years. Started on 0.5 mg, moved  up to 1 mg per day as needed. I’ve heard and read about addiction horror stories, but I’ve personally never had to up my dose (except going from 0.5 to 1 mg) and haven’t had the urge to take more than prescribed. I suffer from major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Ativan helps my anxiety immensely. Especially useful for full-blown panic attacks - within half an hour I feel normal again. At first it made me sleepy, but as my body got used to it, that side effect went away. There was a time when I was having debilitating anxiety on a daily basis, and my pdoc advised me that I could take up to 4 mg per day. Thankfully, I haven’t had the need to take that much. Overall, Ativan is a great medicine. I could go days without taking it with no adverse effects (I.e. withdrawal). This medicine works well for me. Good luck!!",Inkaisua

It's meant to have a calming effect on severely anxious individuals or help ease insomnia. I've read Ativan is prescribed to calm patients before surgery.

37,Ativan,Anxiety,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 16, 2019",26,"Ativan is an amazing drug to take for sleep and for anxiety however proceed with caution if you struggle with depression and are not on other meds for depression. I started taking Ativan for insomnia and for anxiety but it unmasked depression for me and put me in a real dark place and all I did was cry before I would finally go to sleep. I slept amazing but like I said, it made me feel more depressed. :( So for that reason I had to stop taking it. But it is the best for sleep, I always woke up feeling super refreshed if I took Ativan the night before and it didn’t make me have any crazy dreams like some meds for sleep can do.

38,Ativan,Anxiety,8.0,,"June 9, 2019",17,"Addiction, dependence, and abuse are all 3 very different things and carry different definitions and connotations.  I see many worried about addiction.  As with any of the many drugs that change a physiological function, our bodies can become up or down-regulated and normalize the presence of the drug. Any mammal reducing or discontinuing certain drugs, like Ativan, can experience dependence, characterized by physical and emotional distress at withdrawal. This is should NOT alone be considered ADDICTION. Addiction often involves dependence, but that's not all. If you discontinue Ativan and find yourself drinking uncharacteristically more, or pursuing other chemical ways to cope, you may have a valid addiction concern.  Phy./emo. dependence, is not the only criteria for AdXN. Dr's are generally accepting of this and should take no offence. Consult an expert, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol are the only common substances that can be dangerous if d/c'd suddenly.",Gentleman

My psychiatrist finally prescribed me 15 pills per month of 1 mg of Ativan. I’m now 18, and just went through a really hard time. I relapsed into severe anxiety, had to quit all my schooling. My panic attacks can last for hours, and this is the only thing that provides relief during those sleepless nights. If it weren’t for Ativan, I’d have gone to the hospital 30 times now.  It is pretty easy to become dependent. I’m tapering off, went from 0.5 mg per day to 0.25 mg, to skipping days. The withdrawal symptoms are not terrible, but they’re definitely uncomfortable. I suffered vertigo, insomnia, and increased anxiety. Advice to anyone taking this medication: Never cut cold turkey. Although rare, it can cause seizures if you stop the medication suddenly.

Completely prevented flashbacks and nightmares and anxiety at night and allowed me to fall asleep very calmly.

I have GAD and it is the only thing that calms my mind and makes me feel normal if I am in high anxiety mode. I have reduced my amount needed to one half of the .5 pill to help sleep and the other half if I wake up too early and cannot get back to sleep. I also use it to fly.

155,Ativan,Anxiety,10.0,,"September 9, 2015",115,"This medicine has saved my life on several occasions.  I developed physical anxiety issues (severe tingling, losing balance, trouble driving, insomnia, etc) a year after my 3rd child was born.  My physician tried several SSRI and tricyclic antidepressants.  They all made my symptoms worse.  Ativan/Lorazepam helped immediately for all symptoms.  In my opinion it is a miracle and I hate how it is demonized in the media and medical community.  When you suffer a month without sleeping hardly at all and can barely function in a normal setting due to crippling physical anxiety symptoms, and something provides relief, you take it.

Am flying again in 1 week, so I will try my timing again. Luckily our favorite vacation spot is only an hour away, but whew.",SEAMONKEY1020

I lead a stressful life and sometimes there's no amount of relaxing watching movies etc to get my body to calm down. I always want to get up and run workout etc. If used properly it's a lifesaving medication for me, losing my hair from stress Gilberts syndrome etc finally I am able to enjoy my life again enjoy movies etc. Used properly it's a tool I wish to have at my touch at all times available.
