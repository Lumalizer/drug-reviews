1,Rituximab,Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 7, 2016",15,"Retuximab is a great success for me, given me back my health. No side effects whatsoever during or since infusions. My only symptom of WG/GPA was aggressively recurring subglottic stenosis. Retuximab brought it under control within 12 weeks. I'm now symptom free & no longer need tracheal dilation surgery every 3 months. I had my first 1 gram infusion 13 months ago & 1g on day 14. I repeated the same doses Retuximab at 12 months. Immunosuppression has not caused any  ill effects. I take low dose antibiotic cotrimoxazole continuously, (& probiotic for gut health). I've had no infections. I initially took 20mg prednisone tapered to 0 over 8 weeks, no steroids since. Retuximab spared me from other aggressive meds. Infusions are easy for me. â˜º",Gondy Omron
2,Rituximab,Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 12, 2016",16,"I have had wegeners since April 2008.  Medications of prednisone, cyclophosomide, and methotrexate were successful in slowing down the disease. However I still had flareups a two three times yr requiring hospitalization and the resumption of heavy doses prednisone till better, then had to taper back off.   In June 2013 I again was back in hospital and in Sept 2013 I started on Rituxan getting 2 doses 2wks apart & again six months later.  I only take 5 mg of prednisone a day and remain on methotrxate 20mg once per week.  I have eliminated hospital visits & have enjoyed life much more. I am just finishing this month my 2 dose shots & now looking in 6 months reducing it to one dose every six months and reducing my methotreate to 15 mg .Side effects minor",ChiChar
3,Rituximab,Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis,8,,"December 26, 2011",41,"I have taken this medication 4 times over the past 5 weeks or so. I have had no complications other than a little wheeze caused by a narrowing of my bronchial airways.  My CT scan shows a ""dramatic response"" to the medications and no new nodules. I am very hopeful that this is the cure for this disease. I am feeling wonderful and I would encourage anyone to take the chance that it too may change your life. Do your research and then try.  I did and I am so very happy.  I have a future now.",vfreeman
