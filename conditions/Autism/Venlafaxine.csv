0,Venlafaxine,Autism,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 10, 2022",0,"I was put on them, then after  10 mins I went crazy started shaking, vomiting and my memory going blank. Confusion.. trouble breathing",Irish
1,Venlafaxine,Autism,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 15, 2022",1,"I was put on Effexor 6 months ago for autism, BPD and ADHD which it supposedly helps too (I disagree as I’ve been more inattentive and forgetful as ever). I would have meltdowns occurring very frequently before I took venlafaxine as well as severe anxiety and intrusive thoughts. Venlafaxine has completely numbed my anxiousness and taken my meltdowns from a 10 ~ nearly killing myself during every episode to a 2 ~ only sometimes getting distressed and it being very quickly dissolved. I really don't like tablets, even the thought of taking them makes me feel sick plus I’m forgetful and miss consecutive days in a row. Maybe this is why my side affects are so bad as I’m constantly on and off them, but trying to get used to this drug feels awful. I was physically sick, constant nausea, profusely sweating, muscle spasms, couldn’t keep my eyes still, couldn’t get comfy, bad headache and dizziness, but I’m not constantly on edge like I usually am. Can’t decide if I love it or not",Indiii

3,Venlafaxine,Autism,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 24, 2019",39,"Effexor XR (venlafaxine):I'm 22 with autism and I take 20mg of effexor xr and I've been taking it for 2 years! And this medication has helped me a lot, it makes me socialize with people more! And be more at ease in a social situation! And I've had no bad side effects at all! I highly recommend this medicine",High functioning autistic
4,Venlafaxine,Autism,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 8, 2019",44,"Effexor (venlafaxine):I have took this about 3 weeks ago started on 75mg felt nausea bad the first day than the second was easy headache a little nausea panic but as a week went on symptoms went away and I felt a lot better. The reasons why I don't put up a full 10 cause  if you take it late, after the 24 hour period since your last dose, you start to experience withdraw. It is different for everyone But I was fine, I'm autistic, suffer from acute anxiety, PTSD, panic depression bad, it saves my life so far am scared of horror stories but as an autistic adult I look at it as an opportunity",Anonymous
5,Venlafaxine,Autism,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 2, 2015",14,"I have Asperger Syndrome, also Major Depression, Dysthymia and General Anxiety. Venlafaxine did nothing to help any of symptoms and had the side effects of completely removing my sense of hunger, nausea and eventually night sweats and nightmares.I think this drug will only help autistic symptoms they're also symptoms of co-morbid depression and/or anxiety. I imagine the social symptoms are made worse by depression/anxiety and in that case you may find it will help you.It's a strong antidepressant, but comes with strong side effects.",Anonymous
6,Venlafaxine,Autism,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 11, 2012",92,"Effexor (venlafaxine):My son was given this medicine by a developmental pediatrician when he was 8 yrs old.

7,Venlafaxine,Autism,10.0,,"December 1, 2010",94,"Effexor (venlafaxine):This is a great medicine for those it helps. It really changed my life around. It has helped me so much to be more comfortable with having Asperger Syndrome and to deal with all the associated issues (OCD, depression, etc). It's literally saved my life. I do recommend trying this medicine as if it works for you, it's worth trying.",Anonymous
