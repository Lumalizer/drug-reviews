2,Memantine,Autism,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 11, 2019",33,"I take 10mg twice daily for autism spectrum disorder. It stops the intrusive thoughts, rumination, and repetitive thinking which is a Godsend. It also reduces repetitive behaviour/stereotypes. I haven't noticed any side effects, maybe a little brain fog, but that has disappeared with continued use.",Autie101
