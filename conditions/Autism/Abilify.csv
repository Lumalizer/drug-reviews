0,Abilify,Autism,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 28, 2022",0,"Abilify was used for my son with autism for one year. Abilify 7.5 mg helped with eloping and stemming behaviors. When Abilify was increased to 15mg, there was even more aggression. Straterra was added for focus, however it did nothing for the aggression. The psychiatrist mixed this drug with Straterra 40 mg and hydroxyzine 50 mg which was for trouble sleeping. Different dose amounts were used between all three of these drugs, but nothing helped his aggression.",Kind&True

2,Abilify,Autism,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 20, 2021",3,Our 15 year old son was put on Abilify to help with violent tics/outbursts. It seemed to help at first. He seemed more mellow. But slowly they upped his dosage. The tics/outbursts became more frequent and he would not sleep at night. We took him off Abilify. The tics/outbursts still happen but it's more of an occasional thing versus every single day - multiple times a day. He's been given Clonodine to help him sleep. It puts him to sleep - but we still contend with him getting up every night and sometimes not going back to sleep.,Angel Mae
3,Abilify,Autism,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 14, 2021",3,"My son is 14 now. He was on 1mg of Abilify for about two years. It was a nightmare but he'd become suicidal when we'd try to quit it. His personality changed. He went from being a vegetarian to wanting to hunt and ate meat every meal. He developed bizarre sexual interests, craved alcohol, became so aggressive I couldn't get him to school and suffered a manic episode and psychotic break requiring hospitalization. He craved sweets constantly and gained 50 pounds.Please think twice before letting your child try this drug. He's on Zyprexa and Depakote now and never been better.",Mom

7,Abilify,Autism,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 15, 2021",3,This really helped my rage/irritability but not possible to continue taking due to severe weight gain. I was put on it when I was 12 and it completely halted my metabolism. I was 75lbs when I started it and within 2 months I was 140lbs. I went from a double zero size to a size 13 in just 8 weeks. I no joke could gain weight from eating an apple. I have stretch marks and extra skin to this day (12 years later) from it. I got off it as soon as we switched drs (my dr at the time refused).,Mattie0741

10,Abilify,Autism,,,"December 31, 2020",28,"My son was prescribed Abilify years ago on a low dosage and it seemed to help him a lot. He had some weight gain but not much. As he got older and bigger he started having issues again and he was taken off Abilify and put on Risperidone. It was a complete disaster and things got bad really, really fast. Eventually he was put back on Abilify at a higher dosage and taken off Risperidone and things are much better. I recommend Abilify over Risperidone any day for autism.",Mac
11,Abilify,Autism,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 2, 2020",25,"My daughter (13) was put on Abilify when she was 7 for aggression and severe behaviours. At first it seemed to help but after awhile she was just back to her usual severe behaviours. She use to be a tiny girl but she became over weight very quickly with this med. We had to put locks on the fridge and cupboards but then she literally ripped the doors off to get to the food!! Over the years we tried to wean her off several times but the side effects of weaning were terrible so every time we would put her back on. This time we have been weaning her off very very slowly over several months now, weaning down 2.5 mgs a month and it’s been much easier on her system. We have noticed a dramatic change in her seizures and she hasn’t had one in months now. We haven’t seen any changes in her behaviours, she isn't any worse, the same today on 2.5 mgs as she was when she was on 20mgs. So we really don’t think it was doing anything for her.",Anonymous
12,Abilify,Autism,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 2, 2020",17,"15 year old son was prescribed Abilify for anxiety and aggression that started recently. It stopped the aggression and regulated his sleep cycle nicely. However, after 5 months, he started having crying episodes and seemed depressed mixed with mood swings.  Side effects included drooling and feeling like he had to pee but couldn't. It amplified fixated/recurring thoughts to the point of serious debilitation. Doctor advised to try reducing dose. Found Ativan worked better when there was any potential flareup and have used that on an as-needed basis. Reducing dose and hoping to find better solution.",anonymous

Our autistic sons aggression towards his siblings had been a major problem for many years and other drugs that were prescribed didn't help much. Much to our surprise, a day or two after starting abilify our son immediately backed down from arguing for the first time in his life. We were all absolutely stunned.My sons irritable and aggressive  behaviour (due to his autism) wreaked havoc on our family and destroyed relationships between our kids.

It has only been three months, though, so I will book mark this page and let you know how he is in 3 more months. He's been diagnosed Asperger Syndrome since 5 y.o. Perhaps it works better on AS? He could definitely gain some weight since he is on a weight lifting program. He is a lot less argumentative. He also is a devout believer and  biblical Christianity, so coupled with prayer, bible study, staying away from sexual or violent movies and video games, this makes a difference in this overall health.",Good Father

His dose went from 1ml to 10ml over two weeks and his behaviour spiralled out of control with every increase. He just went from bad to worse to horrific. He couldn’t control his thoughts! He became uncontrollably aggressive and wanted to hurt himself. We ended up phoning Emergancy Pediatrics and they put him back onto Risperidone and everything returned to normal.

27,Abilify,Autism,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 28, 2018",16,"This was for my son. The side effects are worse than the original problems.  Extreme weight gain immediately craved food, excessive thirst, already high triglycerides made worse, vision changes immediately.  Trying to get my son off the medication is making the symptoms worse with behavior and insomnia.  He is no longer needing to eat non-stop and he doesn’t use his glasses all day anymore if at all which is how it was before. He has had many almost psychotic episodes screaming that he doesn’t know what he wants to do and completely unable to go to sleep.  He has separation anxiety cannot be alone, increased aggression and work refusal at school. It’s been a month of trying to wean him off. Gradually every step down causes more problems like this.

It started a pattern of new insomnia where I wake up multiple times a night so I went off of it and got really irritating and anxiety triggering dyskenesia.
