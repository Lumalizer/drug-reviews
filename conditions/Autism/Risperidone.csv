0,Risperidone,Autism,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 28, 2022",0,"My son was prescribed risperidone from his pediatrician when six years old. He was suspected then for autism, which now he has definitely been diagnosed with. My son had extremely aggressive behaviors in preschool and kindergarten. The risperidone was given at .5 once a day. This had a drastic change in his behavior. He gained excessive weight from this medication. This medication worked for about a year or so, and then all the aggression and behaviors came back. My son became on the verge of being diabetic, and the medication was stopped. He rapidly lost the weight that was gained from this medication after discontinuing. This medication is only good for a short while if it works.",Kind&True
1,Risperidone,Autism,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 7, 2022",0,"I was given this at 8 years old for autism, irritability and hyperactivity. 8 years old. I was a super thin, playful, insanely happy, always pent up with energy little girl but I disrupted the class by either randomly screaming with excitement, laughing loudly or having tantrums. In October 2004 I was on this for about 3 weeks. I gained THIRTY freakin pounds in 3 weeks!!! I was a bottomless pit, very sleepy, lazy, fell asleep randomly. My teachers loved me like that but at the end of that week when I was so sleepy I fell and hit my head on a table at lunch at school  my parents immediately discontinued the medication. I took something else which I forgot but it was 1000000x better!! I lost all the weight, my personality and appetite went back to normal.",Selena

Doctor justified giving me this drug after I had a mere hx of instructive thoughts.It made me throw up when it hit my system. It made me shake. It took away my motivation for several years. It made me gain 50 lbs that I struggle to lose.  Made me have mood swings and my first ever psychotic episode. When it ran out it unlocked a whole new level of anxiety I never experienced before. Drove me to insomnia and I struggle to sleep without an anti-psychotic since. Had to drink several red bulls and smoke cigarettes just to function.Since I’ve been off the meds, I don’t need cigs or Red Bulls. Have been nicotine 3 for three years! Screw this horrible drug. Made me hyperventilate when walking. Caused me to have circulatory problems, breast-like growths and gout. All improved when I got off this  medicine.",Ragrat

It made her develop excess leg hair. It didn't stop her depression and aggression. It also once made her period last 3 whole weeks. Luckily she lost all the weight when she came off of it.

6,Risperidone,Autism,3.0,,"March 14, 2020",22,"Cannot recommend risperidone for autism. If you insist on using, do so with extreme caution!—and careful increasing dose. My son, age 9, was put on low-dose (.25) for meltdowns associated with autism spectrum disorder. He did fine, with complete eradication of meltdowns, for six weeks. Then doctor ordered us to give him a second dose daily. That is when the horrible side effects began: weird flicking gestures with his fingers and hands. He said he was compelled to do it to get rid of an itch, but couldn’t express himself very well. At first we thought it was an obsessive-compulsive disorder, perhaps caused by the RESPIRDAL. But then I discovered tardive akathesia — which is a restless syndrome caused by this class of drug and which manifests as weird body movements. No sure diagnosis yet; still weaning him slowly off the drug. But the experience is terrifying—my son is TORMENTED by this urge to flick his hands, and I pray to God it stops, once we end the med. I read that is usually temporary.",Thriftyd

With .25 Risperdol drops in the morning and again .25 at 4 or 5 in the evening changed her violence to tears (big improvement). She is now able to cry from her frustration.

I could barely understand or react to anything anyone was saying, I had uncontrollable jerky tics. My night terrors got way worse. I fought my parents tooth and nail to get off this drug. They tried to hide it in my food and drinks but I seen pieces and grinds of it every time. After a few weeks I stopped taking it.

However, my nephew's psychiatrist does not believe in benzodiazepines and chose to medicate  his autism-related anxiety, agoraphobia, and tearfulness with this medication, which is an antipsychotic NOT a medication for anxiety or depression. As a result, my nephew became agitated and self-injurious for the first time ever, claiming he wanted to claw his skin off. Please watch for these reactions, these meds are not a benign panacea.

49,Risperidone,Autism,,,"January 31, 2011",34,"My son is four years old and was put on risperidone.  His behavior is so much better.  We're not having anymore violence, screaming, biting, hitting, kicking, and throwing things. In general, he is more compliant when asked to do something, like get dressed.  I might add that he has started doing this weird thing, and it has to be associated with the medication because it started at exactly the same time.  He takes an excessive amount of baths.  He can go about 15 minutes in between each one.  He is up to about 40 baths a day.  He doesn't wash, he just likes the feeling of being wet.  We can definitely handle it though.  It's a lot better than the violence that we were experiencing.  It's just a weird side effect.",Has greatly helped

It has helped him but he is weighing 72lbs (now 7 years old) and his sugar is up. Now we are on the hunt for a replacement. At least it helped us for 3 years. My son has PDD.,Anonymous

The only negative things I can think of is the danger of the medication itself.But for me the benefits definitely outweigh the risks...For now anyway",Anonymous

I can't really say I noticed a big difference while on it anyway.",Adaddy
54,Risperidone,Autism,3.0,,"November 11, 2009",61,Risperdal (risperidone):My high functioning autistic son was placed on this medication to help control his anger and aggression. Instead it has made him worse. The only positive effect of this medication is that it helps him sleep past 5am. His anger and aggression and impulsiveness are just out of control. He was then put on Vyvanse to help with ADHD and there are no changes worth noting.,Anonymous

After about 10 months I found out the doctor should have been doing blood work to test his porlactin level. His levels should have been between 2.8 and 5.8. His was 55.9. His doctor told me this was okay and not to worry till it got up to 1000 or higher. We tried other medications but nothing seem to help like the Risperdal. So he is back on the Risperdal. It does not have the same effect in girls that it does boys. ",Anonymous
56,Risperidone,Autism,2.0,,"July 19, 2009",73,Risperdal (risperidone):My son has high functioning autism and the doctor prescribed this medication for outburst and agitation. It did the exact opposite. He became more aggressive and physically abusive to the point he could no longer go to school and learn anything else. It took time to gradually take him off the medication and once we did he was so much better. An ADHD medication worked much better.,Anonymous

It turned down my emotions just enough (I'm on .5mg) that I could actually function in normal society.  Thanks to it, I am now in college (when I was diagnosed at 16 I was failing half my courses) and doing phenomenally well.  I can't say this will work for everyone, but I must say it's exactly what I needed.  Thank you Janssen Pharmaceutical, you have given me a future.",Schmitty
