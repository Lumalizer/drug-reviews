0,Effexor,Autism,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 8, 2019",44,"I have took this about 3 weeks ago started on 75mg felt nausea bad the first day than the second was easy headache a little nausea panic but as a week went on symptoms went away and I felt a lot better. The reasons why I don't put up a full 10 cause  if you take it late, after the 24 hour period since your last dose, you start to experience withdraw. It is different for everyone But I was fine, I'm autistic, suffer from acute anxiety, PTSD, panic depression bad, it saves my life so far am scared of horror stories but as an autistic adult I look at it as an opportunity",Anonymous

2,Effexor,Autism,10,,"December 1, 2010",94,"This is a great medicine for those it helps. It really changed my life around. It has helped me so much to be more comfortable with having Asperger Syndrome and to deal with all the associated issues (OCD, depression, etc). It's literally saved my life. I do recommend trying this medicine as if it works for you, it's worth trying.",Anonymous
