2,Ziprasidone,Autism,10.0,,"February 23, 2021",1,Geodon (ziprasidone):Geodon helps me have a great memory and that's about all it does.

Increased dose was very sedating, but helped alot. I have aspergers, PTSD, social anxiety,  and panic disorder. This med Increased libido, motivation, desire to socialize, ability to organize, moderately decreased depression but not very helpful for panic/anxiety. At any dose was unable to relax most of the time. I got a rash on my scalp and severe cystic acne on my face, shoulders and back that worsened as time went on so I discontinued.",Jenna4160

12,Ziprasidone,Autism,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 6, 2015",36,"Geodon (ziprasidone):My daughter has autism and ADHD, she has been extremely violent from a baby. Specialists had her on Risperdal which did help initially then they added different antidepressants and also Ritalin. Once she started on the Zeldox it was nothing short of a miracle for us. After a few weeks she is functioning like a ""normal"" child.. We cannot believe it. Even strangers come up to us to say how good our daughter is as they have seem her before. I know that there is no ""cure"" for autism but after years and years of animal like behaviour and violence I can honestly say its like a miracle for us. I just hope and pray that it lasts. She has experienced dystonia with it and we have reduced it, but its like it has flicked a switch on in her brain.",Austistic Angel
