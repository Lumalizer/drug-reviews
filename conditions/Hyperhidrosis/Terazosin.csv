0,Terazosin,Hyperhidrosis,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 24, 2018",10,I originally requested this medication after some research regarding sweating caused by my antidepressants. I works fantastic for the sweating. I also have quite a history of urinary problems and it has also helped with that problem. Also high blood pressure runs in my family. Although I have never needed BP medicine I am proud to report that my blood pressure it perfect! I have been on terazosin for many years so I perhaps it is keeping my BP in check as I age. For me it had been a great medicine. No side affects that negativity impact me. I am on 1mg 2 caps in AM and one in the PM,Jw
1,Terazosin,Hyperhidrosis,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 3, 2017",6,"Also take for extreme facial sweating resulting as a side effect of antidepressants. Been taking for years after searching for relief and finding online article mentioning study of terasozin for this purpose. Sometimes works well in sweat reduction, sometimes not at all, but better than nothing. Tried drysol topical but my skin is too sensitive. Curious what mg dosage others take. I take 2mg x 2 after driving into work as I think it contributes to dizziness, likely along with other meds.",Anon00
