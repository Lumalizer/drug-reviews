I was at wits  end and nearly begging my Dr., when she prescribed 5mg of Oxybutynin. I noticed a big improvement on just the second day. Taken twice a day has given me complete relief.

1,Oxybutynin,Hyperhidrosis,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 7, 2022",0,"Hello, I’m a 53 yo woman. Started taking two doses of 5mg of oxybutrin about 2 months ago. I had relief starting on day one. I’ve had hyperhydrosis for the last 10-15 years. Horrible head, face, neck and back. It was debilitating. My only issue is the dry mouth. I have an autoimmune disease that also causes dry mouth and my gums are suffering horribly. I’ve tried the mouthwashes for dry mouth. The mints. Drinking water with lemon, none of it works. The products for it  make my mouth feel slimy and skin peels away with the slime. Any one else have this problem? Mind you I drink at least a gallon of fluid a day if not more. Going to ask my doc at the next visit if I can drop down to 5mg once a day to see if it helps. If anyone has had experience with this and found a solution plz share. I can’t go back to the debilitating sweating.",Cat

3,Oxybutynin,Hyperhidrosis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 7, 2022",1,"I've been on methadone for approx 10 years and the sweating is intolerable. I get weird looks from others thinking I was sick and contagious and find it so hard to make friends because of it. I was started on probanthine which didn't help then I went on oxybutynin, at first they were a god send. Accept for a dry mouth it was good. Then as time went by I started to have bladder problems, severe stomach aches and I was miserable again. Now lm going to try them again because of the sweating but at a reduced dose. I  know they work but there is still a fine line between relief from sweating and unwanted side effects from the sweating cure.l will have to tweak the dosage so l can get a happy medium I suppose.",Anonymous

9,Oxybutynin,Hyperhidrosis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 6, 2021",8,"The Diagnose Me episode ""Woman who Couldn't Stop Sweating""- that's me in the documentary. Took 10 years from 2000-2010 for diagnosis of generalized hyperhidrosis. From active, social, outgoing, world traveler diplomat's wife to housebound, depressed sweat mess. Finally in 2010 a reaction to a drug ( won't name) for ""depression"" saw me bedridden 24/7 sweaty and suicidal. Never depressed before sweating began! My husband found on internet Dutch study on hyperhidrosis and oxybutynin in 2010. One doctor (thankfully) agreed to try it. I stopped sweating completely in 4 days - never sweated a day since. 5mg twice a day still works perfectly for me. I'm overjoyed my story has helped many others. I hear from some personally. Shockingly, many doctors today are still unfamiliar with the condition or oxybutynin to treat it. I have to explain why I'm taking oxybutynin.",happytohelp

I have 5mg pills - which work well and fairly quick it seems.

It led me to drinking because that's the only way I felt comfortable. Because of family genes and my life style I became an alcoholic. Now in recovery for two years and you know what I've been taking for two years..OXYBUTNIN I researched online, came across it and asked my doctor about it I was hesitant but after living my life not being comfortable with myself wasn't an option for me anymore anyway I took it and am taking it and it works like a miracle I""m telling you. I don't do these reviews thingies but if I knew about this back in high school maybe my life would've been a bit different, I don't know.

12,Oxybutynin,Hyperhidrosis,9.0,,"April 21, 2021",15,"Since starting Oxybutynin I want to cry most days - cry tears of joy - I place my normally constantly sweating hands on things it would normally come away leaving puddle to find nothing, I can dry my hair without needing to put my fan on or wipe my armpits, face or hands dry afterwards. It's the miracle I have been looking for ever since I began sweating at puberty, warm weather, cold weather, any kind of excursion anything absolutely anything would set it off (I am now a 32). I can finally wear t'shirts!!!! And tops that are not black,  And jackets that are not black. Honestly almost crying typing this, totally over the moon. I started on 2.5mg twice a day but have just upped to 5mg twice daily, hopefully that will stop the sweating I still get on my back and feet, I am very confident the upping to 10mg a day will do the job. Incredible, all I want to do is shout about it from the rooftops :) :) :). I can sit in the cold - NOT sweating .. an absolute novelty. Amazing.",Swettybear
13,Oxybutynin,Hyperhidrosis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2021",30,"Have had excessive sweating since puberty. Any change in outside temp on skin; exertion; stress ; etc. brings on large drop sweating thru out my hair, face and neck so bad that I look like I just came out of a shower w/ my clothes on except that the drops just keep on dropping. My Hyperhydrosis stems from: Thyroid Disease, Lupus, Type II Diabetes, hi-dose Prednisone, Fibromyalgia, Stenosis, severe Psyatica and extreme pain to name just a few of my ailments...But I live with these things - they're manageable. But the Sweating is horrendous. People kept asking me If I needed help cause I look like I'm having a heart attack. My Endo put me on Oxybutynin 5mg/2 day 3 wks ago and for the last 3 weeks I barely sweat. Now instead of sweating I'm crying tears of joy! Yes my side effects include dry mouth, skin, & eyes; dizziness; weakness; sleepiness; but all these are manageable.  I can go out in public again! Get out amongst the living so to speak!

14,Oxybutynin,Hyperhidrosis,10.0,,"March 6, 2021",72,"I am a 38 year old female & had suffered from excessive facial & underarm sweating since I was a teenager. I had tried everything imaginable to reduce sweating. The littlest bit of exertion & I'd be dripping in sweat, no matter the temperature. I couldn't even do simple things like get dressed/ready in the morning or go to the grocery store without dripping in sweat. People would constantly ask me if I was ok, thinking I was sick. I'd then sweat more just from worrying/being embarrassed about the sweating. I asked my doctor to try this medication due to everyone's reviews on here. He started me with 2.5mg 2x a day for 2 weeks. I didn't see any change and thought the same as I always do- nothing will help me. My doctor then raised the dose to 5mg 2x a day and I noticed a change that next day- I had gotten out of the shower, dressed, and blow-dryed my hair without a drip of sweat!

This medication has been the miracle  I have been looking for.  All of my sweating has stopped!  The only side effect I am experiencing is a dry mouth which is a small price to pay for in exchange for stopping the sweating.  This medication has changed my life! I would give a 10 pout of 10.

I couldn't work I was embarrassed to go in public I tried light clothing, vitamins and cutting down my dose but nothing was working. I knew I wasn't ready to come completely off of the methadone but was getting close to give up so one day talking with someone at the clinic they told me about this medication oxybutynin so I thought I would give it a try and it has changed my life.

19,Oxybutynin,Hyperhidrosis,10.0,,"October 29, 2020",30,"What a difference oxybutynin has made to my quality of life, I started developing symptoms of cranium (facial) hyperhydrosis (sweating)  around 10 years ago in school, I would sit there in class and start to panic that I might suddenly burst out sweating.This continued for the next 10 years and made social situations really awkward and my anxiety grew with this. I would turn to alcohol as much as possible to try and remain calm, as I just knew the slightest trigger would set me off. This disease has had such a negative impact on my life and I took it upon myself 12 months ago to do everything I could to get some relief. I started with the Driclor and then even had botox, none of which worked. I finally found Oxybutynin for sweating through this forum and got prescribed it from the doc. What a difference to my life it has made and the sweating has almost completely stopped. Highly recommend this drug to anyone that suffers from this disease and the dry mouth subsides after a few weeks.",AdamBoer

Nothing worked well enough to off set the side effects I was having so I waited until I was 14 to have a Sympathectomy. That worked pretty well on my hands and feet but really only pushed the sweating to my stomach, back, and thighs. At the time oxybutynin was never used for sweat but I was willing to try anything my doctor suggested. It worked surprisingly well and I am still taking it 15 years later.

I have suffered from this awful condition for 20 years and never thought I would be free from it. The sweating has contributed, over the years, to me having panic attacks, developing OCD and left me on 3 different medications including an antipsychotic, a class c drug and an antidepressant. I have had numerous blood tests (checking Thyroid etc) and in the end the doctor put the sweating down to panic attacks. I read the reviews on here and asked my GP to prescribe Oxybutynin to see if it would work. From the first dose I noticed an improvement. I am on my 5th dose and the different in unbelievable. The sweating is all but gone. In normal conditions I don't sweat. When I am exercising I only sweat a little. I am so thankful for this medication and your reviews. Hyperhidrosis is a terrible condition that can ruin peoples lives and needs to be taken more seriously by medics. Thank you all!",maro111

27,Oxybutynin,Hyperhidrosis,9.0,,"May 14, 2020",63,"I suffered from nervous sweats, and also found out that when I worked out I would sweat way more than others, I know we have different sweat glands and levels of sweating but I would always be drenched and it seem a little to excessive. The nervous sweats would happen at what I would say times you would not like it to happen e.g. dinner parties, meeting new people. The annoying thing is that I'm not a nervous person in fact quite sociable it was like my body had a different reaction (sweating) to how I was actually feeling (confident, sociable, fine!)Since I've taken the medication its been a great success -no nervous sweats etc. even when I exercise my clothing isn't drenched, just what think it should look like in comparison to other people.I did have a very minor headache the first day I took the tablets but can't say it was due to the medication I've not experienced any other side effects but I hope this post is helpful to anyone that had been struggling.",Alexanderthegr88

35,Oxybutynin,Hyperhidrosis,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 13, 2020",22,Been prescribed this oxybutynin only a week ago to take twice daily a dose of 2.5mg. (total 5mg). I have had excessive sweating for years but had other health concerns that were more a priority. Only recently got round to discussing it. I've found this is working so far but I am quite sensitive to all medications due to a slow metabolism (according to my psychiatrist) meaning I'm more prone to side effects. So I initially became really drowsy and felt quite strange in myself. I've also found myself feeling an unbearable sense of impending dread that I can't shift. I wonder if it is a side effect to be agitated or uneasy. Will need to weigh up pros and cons to see if I should continue treatment.,Cathy

38,Oxybutynin,Hyperhidrosis,9.0,,"October 21, 2019",29,I was beginning to really lose hope in ever finding something that would stop my excessive sweating all over my body and then saw someone mention oxybutynin on a forum. I started on ProBanthine but I didn’t react well at all and had a couple of instances where I felt close to fainting. I then asked to change to oxybutynin and was prescribed 5mg tablets to be taken 4 times a day. The tablets have completely changed my life. The tablets can make you feel funny the first few weeks but the side effects soon wore off.  I still sweat slightly more than most during exercise but it is much less than before. The main benefit is in day to day life where doing normal things I no longer sweat. I would really recommend these for anyone struggling with excessive sweating. You may not see the results instantaneously but stick with them and hopefully they work for you.,UK
39,Oxybutynin,Hyperhidrosis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 6, 2019",59,"At 35 I have suffered my whole life with palmer, plantar and axillary sweating. Causing social anxiety from teasing, depression and ultimately turned me into a shut in. I didn't date as a teen or even in my 20's because I couldn't hold hands. I recently begged my doctor to do the surgery and then he casually mentions this medication. At first I was furious that all of the doctors I have had over the years have known about my issue and no one ever offered a prescription option. After starting it and having pretty good success I am still torn between anger and just extreme burden relief. Maybe I can try to make friends now because everyone knows making friends as an adult is easy. I feel like people should talk about this more because apparently it's pretty common. And maybe stop this before all of the emotional damage.",Jonathan E.

I would have sweat stains through the sides of my shoes. I was always miserable!!!! I would sweat in cold weather and ice cold air conditioning. It had nothing to do with heat.

This has mostly been easier to disguise and manage but it is a constant worry and a nightmare in the summer months.20 years later, I discovered Propantheline Bromide and then Lyrinel XL. The former did have a noticeable benefit when taken early morning well before food but efficacy deteriorated with subsequent top ups in the day. The Lyrinel XL, if allowed to build up a few days, seems much longer lasting and has fewer side effects. Early days and not a complete cure but a massive improvement.",LondonBoy

I would arrive at work saturated. I would need to change my shirt 2 or 3 times in a day. I started on Oxybutinin extended release in February 2016 and the change has been amazing. I experience a number of side effects. Mainly dry mouth, slightly blurred vision and stomach and bowel problems but in comparison to the sweating I know what I prefer. It's made such a difference.

I was then passed to dermatology dept. at hospital who just said nothing could do! Oh the wonder of UK'S NHS!! Said to try propanano, which again did not work. So I did my own research and went 'cap in hand' back to my GP & BEGGED to try Oxybutynin. He said no solid evidence it works & it's just a placebo for hyperhydrosis. Anyway he gave in & said I could try 5mg a day.  I started them 5 days ago & but better so upping dose to 10mg (at night) as makes me drowsy.",Drummie69

My neck just gushed swest. All areas of my life were affected, and I was humiliated on a daily basis. I  heard about an oral medication for hyperhidrosis, so I went online to do some research and I learned about oxybutynin, then went to the doctor who gave me a prescription for 5mg 2x daily. I think it took 2 or 3 days to see a difference, and it was a big difference. I was literally overjoyed. I don't mind the side effects (dry mouth and drowsiness), but for me the oxybutynin does not take the sweating completely away. I'm now in 10 mg 2x daily.

I discovered oxybutinin and it has literally changed the course of my life. I started with one 5mg dose in the morning and one 5mg dose at night. The side effects (drowsiness, foggy brain, dry mouth) were a little much for me so I cut my morning dose in half. This medication has allowed me to feel like a normal person and to engage in activities that I used to withdraw from (public speaking, shaking hands, wearing flip flops, etc.). I tried Botox (very little effect), acupuncture, drysol. Nothing has been nearly as effective as the oxybutinin. It's a game-changer!",ShelbyAS

Within 2nd day of taking it, my sweating was reduced by 70%. 3rd and subsequent days I basically am sweat free. It's been years since I last felt this good!

I have tried many things but nothing worked. Oxybutynin changed my life. I only take one tablet at night as higher dose makes me drowsy and my mouth gets too dry. This is enough to stop my body sweating,   however not enough for my feet; but this is a compromise. Feel like I was given a new life.

My hyperhydrosis was generalized all over. I was put on rubinol forte for this... The sweats stopped within HOURS of the first dose. I now take 3mg in the morning and 3 mg at night. This drug is an antichollergenic which is why it works. If oxybutin isn't making you 100% dry, try rubinol instead. I was to the point where I was so uncomfortable in my own skin after two years of looking like I'd just had a shower all the time, I considered suicide.  I tried hyoscyamine before rubinol.

Over sweating even during winter, was such a embarrassing thing in public situations, sweaty palms, on my face and on other areas of my body. Yes, there are side effects, it makes my mouth and other areas including my skin very dry. I increase my liquid intake, and chew a gum now and then to counteract the total dryness. Along with using a regular lotion like cocoa butter before bed. It also causes a bit of dizziness and zombie like feeling which taking a 2x  5mg begins about an hour after. To overcome this I just time it into my schedule where I don't anticipate doing anything of significant or demanding.
