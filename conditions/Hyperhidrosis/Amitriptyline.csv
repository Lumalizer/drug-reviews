0,Amitriptyline,Hyperhidrosis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 3, 2019",8,"My doctor perscribed this hoping to help with both full body hyperhydrosis and other fibromyalgia symptoms. It was one of the few things I've tried that worked great for the fibromyalgia, but made my already excessive sweating even worse,  so unfortunately I had to quit taking it. Very disappointing because it helped me in so many other ways. I'm hoping I can find something else for the hyperhydrosis so I can start taking this again.",Spot

2,Amitriptyline,Hyperhidrosis,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 19, 2014",44,"I was put on Amitriptyline to aid in sleep while on Prozac.  When I discontinued the Prozac and the amitriptyline because I no longer needed an antidepressant, I noticed an old problem with hyperhidrosis reappeared.  I went back on just 5mg of the amitriptyline and the results were amazing.  No more sweating and feeling very calm all day long.",Anonymous
