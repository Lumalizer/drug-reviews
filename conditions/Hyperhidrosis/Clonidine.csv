3,Clonidine,Hyperhidrosis,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 14, 2020",3,I haven't been taking clonidine for long but I got switched from oxybutin to clonidine for sweating for my methadone. My dose is 138 but going down every other week. On the high side cuz I had a baby. I started taking 1 and a half .1 clonidine twice a day. Did that for a few days and no change. Now I'm doing 3 .1 clonidine twice a day which the only thing I've noticed was a little loopy and if you get up too fast watch out. I thought I was going DOWN! I later read it makes your blood pressure drop I guess. But no go on the sweating stopping. I just want to go back to the oxybutine I think. It wasn't 100 percent but it helped a lot more than this. Dry mouth is crazy but hey you gotta pick wet or dry lol,Marie
4,Clonidine,Hyperhidrosis,10,,"October 2, 2019",13,"I have had fibroid issues from age 25-29. With that came anemia, low iron, night sweats and anxiety. The night sweats were constant so my doctor tried me on Clonidine unsure if it would help. And it did, a miracle the first night. My night sweats stopped completely on a very low dose. Since I started and my anxiety has improved as well. Wish I took this sooner. I had taken SSRIs for anxiety and my night sweats got worse. So happy to have found a solution so I can get a good nights sleep.",Ms.Zzz
5,Clonidine,Hyperhidrosis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 27, 2015",56,I was sweating constantly due to side effects of my medications. I was always hot and sweating. I had to keep my air conditioning on at home 24/7 at 68 degrees just so I wouldn't sweat.My doctor gave me the chlondine 0.1 patch and almost Immediately I noticed a difference. I've been on it for about 9 weeks now and my sweating is completely stopped and under control.  I can actually wear jeans and sweaters again  and be comfortable!!! It's been years of wearing shorts and flip flops in the winter because I was always warm. But thanks to chlondine the sweating has stopped and I can wear sweaters and jeans and shoes in winter now like a normal person without being completely drenched in sweat!! Even people around me have noticed a difference,Matt563
6,Clonidine,Hyperhidrosis,8,,"October 19, 2015",22,"Catapres (clonidine):Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy ETS surgery at T2 to treat severe palmar and facial sweating has been very effective, with about a 90% reduction of hand sweat, and 100% reduction in facial sweating. However, there is a caveat, sweating in other parts of my body increased following the procedure. Also, compensatory sweating on my face and chest (below the nipples) becomes extreme when eating spicy or tart foods. The Catapres substantially decreases this compensatory sweating.",tortoise31415
7,Clonidine,Hyperhidrosis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 24, 2013",46,"After having terrible sweating from SSRI's I tried benztropine and cyproheptadine and nothing helped. After a few doses of clonidine (0.1mg four times a day), I finally found the relief I was waiting for. Has helped my sweating immensely with no side effects. Must try.",ZackaRx11111
8,Clonidine,Hyperhidrosis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 31, 2012",9,I switched from Hytrin to Clonidine for excessive sweating (SSRI induced - Paxil) because I didn't think the Hytrin was working. Now I realize how much better the Hytrin was.  Clonidine hasn't done anything. No side effects either. ,ginapoof
