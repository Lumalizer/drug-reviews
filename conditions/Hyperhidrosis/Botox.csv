0,Botox,Hyperhidrosis,2,,"October 3, 2011",4,"I just got the botox done on my armpits as well as my palms. The hands hurt a lot more than the armpits but I%u2019m not seeing a difference. The sweat is still there and I still have to be cautious of the material I wear as well as the color. Also, I am still feeling a lot of pain in my hands and have muscle weakness. ",Sweaty Susie
1,Botox,Hyperhidrosis,10,,"July 1, 2008",21,"This medication has saved my emotional distress caused by hyperhidrosis.  I wish I had discovered this before doing the thoracic sympanthectomy (SP).  That surgery was horrible, but the Botox takes away the sweating for up to 6 months.  If you have had the surgery, be prepared that from the damage the surgery does, Botox results can last for up to 3 months, but for me never longer.  Insurance can cover it though, and I have had it approved through BCBS.",Anonymous
