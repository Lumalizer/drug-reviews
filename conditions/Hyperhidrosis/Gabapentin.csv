0,Gabapentin,Hyperhidrosis,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 27, 2021",10,"I was prescribed gabapentin for my social anxiety, and to help with stress induced hyperhidrosis. Started 300mg a day (100mg 3x a day), didn't help much.  Increased to 600mg and noticed a decrease in sweating.  Currently at 900mg, (300mg 3x a day) and am experiencing no sweating for the first time in 10 years! Anxiety has improved significantly.  Have been using gabapentin for about 2 months now in total.   Only side-effect I had was dry mouth and increased thirst during first few days of dose increase.",Chl
