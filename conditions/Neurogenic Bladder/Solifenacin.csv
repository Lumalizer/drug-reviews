0,Solifenacin,Neurogenic Bladder,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 30, 2021",0,Diagnosed with cervical myelopathy and have battled severe urinary incontenance and urgency problems for years. Finally had enough and made an appointment with a urologist. After a urodynamic study he prescribed solifenacin. It has made a huge difference in controlling the urges to the point where I hardly ever lose any urine!! Minimal side effects and just really pleased with the results.,Kelly
1,Solifenacin,Neurogenic Bladder,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 10, 2021",0,"For Neurogenic and OA bladder due to Myelomeningocele Using it about three years. I take it for about 9-12 months then rest for 1 month then start again.It's the best medication that is useful for me. First time that I used it at least 6 month it worked excellent. Really  a miracle! Four hours without leaking or incontinence. Because of some reasons I stopped it. After that time, I used Solifenacin again but it can't completely cure my problem, only for 2 hours or maybe 2.5 hour but I like it. Side effects : dry mouth, dry eyes. Dry mouth 2 times a week and dry eyes 1 or 2 times per month only for 10mg or more.I try Botox Injection. My bladder capacity increased 2x but nothing happen for my incontinence.I suggest to  you the best way when living with OAB is using CIC + Medication (Solifenacin, etc).Most of Drugs in Iran is cheap. It cost $1.32 for me. Yes they are expensive for you out of Iran, but they are very low price for us here.",Mohammadd
