0,Bactrim DS,Nocardiosis,7,,"July 6, 2011",16,Have Nocardia infection (now disseminated) - was initially prescribed 6 Bactrim DS tablets daily for one year. After a year my pulmonary doctor said I was cured - no more Bactrim. Nocardia returned after a week. I have now been taking 4 tablets of Bactrim DS daily for over a year now. Tried to lessen the dosage but Nocardia returns. Bactrim DS is keeping me alive. Trying to find a good Infectious Disease doctor near my home.,Weimar_txn
