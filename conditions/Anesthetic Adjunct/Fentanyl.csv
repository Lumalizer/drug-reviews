They said that I couldn't drive for 24 hours but I don't feel anything I just the same as I did before I had the medication so god knows what it's meant to do because it had no effect on me at all",Alfie
1,Fentanyl,Anesthetic Adjunct,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 24, 2020",5,"I had to have some eggs taken from my ovaries for storage because I’m newly single and 39. Before the procedure, the nurse gave me a light sedative and fentanyl. The sedative made it hard for me to keep my eyes open but the fentanyl didn’t work. They gave me a second shot halfway as I was yelling in pain. I felt everything but the sedative made me less responsive. I don’t know if it’s the case for a lot of people but for me it did nothing.",S
