1,Cefuroxime,Surgical Prophylaxis,5,,"January 27, 2016",3,"After a minor cut in the head area, I was given Cefuroxime.  Two days later, I started with a flu that affected my lungs and throat, and it lasted more than four weeks.  I had taken the flu shot three months prior to this event.  Now reading the article from PNAS, it seems like the protection for flu virus went away.  I hadn't had a bad cold for about ten years, ever since I protect myself with the flu shot.",Emilion
