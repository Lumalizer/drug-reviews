0,Ciprofloxacin,Surgical Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 25, 2018",3,"Cipro (ciprofloxacin):I was prescribed this after having a stent placed in my ureter due to kidney stones. Took as directed, one 500mg tab twice/day for 14 days. By day 3, I could barely tolerate the nausea, bloating, and headaches, but continued to take as prescribed. By day 5, after taking 2nd dose for that day, I started getting a pounding, accelerated heart rate followed by anxiety. Called my urologist office, doctor told me to stop taking the cipro immediately, so now its on my allergy list.",Net
