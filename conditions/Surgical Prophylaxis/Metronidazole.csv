0,Metronidazole,Surgical Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 13, 2021",0,"I was prescribed a 3 day course prophylactically after pelvic/abdominal surgery. I made it 1.5 days before I contacted the on call to see if it was safe to discontinue. I had the horrible metallic taste (which I was willing to power through) - but I started having tics and twitches, blurred vision, and occasional difficulty with speech. He advised me to stop. The twitches have decreased and my vision's a bit better after 2 days . . . though I've now been off the medicine than I was on it. Will NEVER take it again.",Kisemiarse

2,Metronidazole,Surgical Prophylaxis,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 17, 2019",0,"Prescribed Flagyl for 3 days, 3 x per day - low dose after tooth extraction to prevent any infection and dry socket. After reading reviews I was very concerned as last time I took antibiotics was over 10 years ago so waited for the terrible side effects. I took with a full glass of water and food and apart from a furry taste in my mouth haven't suffered any side effects.",Snuffy1
3,Metronidazole,Surgical Prophylaxis,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 30, 2018",0,"I have been on metronidazole for almost 4 out of the 10 days now. I am taking it for my wisdom tooth removal to prevent an infection. So far I've been feeling very weak, not sure if its from the medicine or lack of my usual eating. Besides feeling weak, I have been getting winded pretty easily. Also stomach pains which I believe are from the medicine. Besides those , I haven't had many other symptoms from the medicine I believe.",Emma

After talking it over with my doctor she changed the dose from 3 times a day to half strength 4 times a day. The dizziness went away, mostly, but the taste in my mouth is awful.",Crafter1701
5,Metronidazole,Surgical Prophylaxis,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2016",1,"This medication does what it should. I was given in via IV in the hospital for 2 days and sent home on 500mg 3xs/day for 5 days. Since the gallbladder I had removed was extremely infected, they wanted to prevent pancreatitis, or similar issues. While the medicine works well, it makes my stomach hurt, and everything tastes like chalk. Small price to pay to be rid of my evil gallbladder and not suffer other intestinal infections.",TillyD
