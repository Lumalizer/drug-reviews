0,Vancomycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 30, 2019",1,"I was given an IV dose of Vancomycin (due to allergies of other preferred choices), before my total knee replacement in June 2017. I had no reaction to Vancomycin, with no issues with TKR/recovery. My surgery (including all medicine while in hospital) was covered 100%, due to my work insurance using a Center of Excellence program.",purpleprincess6785
1,Vancomycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,,,"October 5, 2011",11,"I was about to go into the operating room for knee replacement and they started Vancomycin via IV.  Shortly I started itching, burning, and skin turned red..... especially the scalp, neck, and palms of my hands.  Surgery was postponed.  This experience was a blessing since I found out the knee replacement contained nickel and I'm VERY allergic to nickel. At least it prevented a disaster!",Waxahachie
