0,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 12, 2021",0,"I had some minor elective face surgery and my plastic surgeon prescribed this antibiotic. 300mg 3x daily. After taking the 4th pill I noticed a metallic taste in my mouth but I just dismissed this sign. A couple of hours after taking the 5th pill I noticed my chest starting to get red and itchy, and then a few hours after that, I knew I was having an allergic skin reaction to this drug because I had a rash all over my body. I immediately stopped taking it and was instructed to take Benadryl. It has taken 2 days for my skin to calm down, however I still do have a minor rash which I'm hoping will clear up soon. Obviously this medication did not agree with my body so needless to say I won't be taking this again and I will be alerting my pharmacy about my allergy to it.",sheedagirl
1,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 7, 2021",0,"I was prescribed 150mg clindamycin capsules, 4 times a day for 10 days following breast augmentation surgery as a preventative precaution. The first few days everything seemed fine as I was also on pain medication as well following surgery. Once I stopped taking the pain medicine and only the antibiotic I felt worse than the surgery pain itself!!!! By day 6 of taking I would get a pounding, explosive, headache that I’m unable to make go away. And I feel overall out of it. I feel worse with each pill as each day passes. Also by day 6 the diarrhea began. It was not multiple times a day like some others have reported. But when it’s time to go, it’s time to go! I followed all instructs, have been drinking an insane amount of water and nothing is helping. I made it 8 days and can’t continue. I had to stop taking and will be calling my surgeon today. My breasts feel great and seem to be healing normally but my body feels like it’s dying from this antibiotic!!",Breast aug
2,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 4, 2021",0,"I had two wisdom teeth extracted and the surgeon prescribed Clindamycin.   My reaction to the drug during the dosing period was mainly reflux.   Upon finishing the dosage, I had some diarrhea which appeared to clear up.   However two weeks later I was hit with a bad bout of C diff colitis, which is awful and now will need even more antibiotics to clear the infection.   Why in heaven's name do oral surgeons prescribe this drug as a prophylaxis is beyond me.   Had I known of this potential mess I would not have taken this antibiotic without there being an actual infection.",Anonymous
3,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 18, 2021",0,"Took with food and a full glass of water, and didn't lay down for 45 minutes after.... All was ok and had no side effects.",V G
4,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 16, 2021",0,"Was prescribed this twice for prevention after the extraction of 4 wisdom teeth (2 in June and 2 in August of the same year). I had to take 4 capsules of 300mg per day, every 6 hours. I didn't get some of the severe side effects most comments here are describing but I did have diarrhea for a few days while on it (both times). I also makes me super tired and it doesn't help that I can't drink coffee while on it. My stomach ""feels upset"" but I'm not in pain. It just rumbles and I think it makes me nauseous at times. All in all, it's what I expected from antibiotics in general - I will incorporate some greek yogurt into my diet to try and give my guts a break. It does taste absolutely horrible and leaves an extremely bitter taste in my mouth.",Lae
5,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 23, 2021",1,It is just awful. All the things everyone else has said. 2 days was enough.I don't even trust the good reviews on here.,Daniel
6,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2021",2,"Wow. I don’t know if this medication would have worked or not for my root canal. I was on it for a day and a half and had to stop because of the horrible taste in my mouth night and day, no matter what else I ate, how often I brushed, or how often I used a mouth rinse. It was HORRIBLE! Bad enough that I tossed and turned all night with the horrible taste in my mouth. So, so bad. I will never take this again.",Grandma D
7,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 5, 2020",4,Prescribed after having wisdom tooth removed. Worst antibiotic imaginable. Diarrhea and stomach pains. Diarrhea took 3 weeks to subside even with use of Imodium. Will never take this medicine again.,CC
8,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 3, 2020",11,"I blindly took this as prescribed for my wisdom tooth removal. 1000mg 3x day for 7 days to prevent post op complications. DO NOT TAKE IT! A week later it caused me to have a severe case C Diff Colitis. I didn't know about any of this but I would have taken my chance on complications (look up studies about if antibiotics even help prevent complications). I've lost so much weight, so tired, bed ridden diarrhea for two weeks now with blood and severe cramps and pain, 102.5 fever, nausea, loss of appetite. The diarrhea being impossible to keep clean has also caused a UTI from E Coli with another fever, blood/clots/tissue, severe pain. NOT WORTH IT. I feel like I was uninformed.",NeverAgain
9,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 28, 2019",5,"I received an IV dose of Cleocin brand Clindamycin before a surgery to remove my gallbladder.  About a week later, I experienced severe stomach cramping and horrible diarrhea.  I waited another week to see if it was just part of the gallbladder removal recovery.  Days later I was in the hospital, I couldn't eat, drink, or even think about food without constant trips to the bathroom.  I tested positive for C Diff and after research learned that studies have shown that this antibiotic comes with an increased rate of C Diff contraction.  If you've had any history digestive issues, I would consider asking your doctor to use a different antibiotic!",MJ
10,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 17, 2019",8,They gave this to me post op after a tooth extraction. 300mg. It’s too strong. I’ve been vomiting nonstop for two days and I can’t even keep water down. I’m about to call the hospital,TEMP
11,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,1,,"July 16, 2018",15,"So I had my wisdom teeth removed June 5th of this year and was prescribed this medication IN CASE I developed a post-op infection. As I'm 17, my immediate favorite ""side effect"" of this medication is that it began to improve my acne. Here's where everything begins to go south. About a week later, I began to notice urgent diarrhea. This problem persisted for several days, at least 10 times a day. I began to lose weight, insane stomach cramps, nausea, I couldn't sleep, severe dehydration. I began to have bowel movements that only consisted of blood and mucus. I was admitted to the hospital for GI scopes. The next morning my surgeon came to review the procedure. He said I was positive for C. DIFF immediately asked if I had been on Clindamycin. He then explained how powerful this antibiotic is and how it basically stripped my colon of all of my ""good bacteria"", allowing the C. Diff bacteria to become toxic. DO NOT TAKE THIS ANTIBIOTIC IF YOU CAN AT ALL HELP IT!",Betty
12,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,9,,"July 29, 2017",6,Prescribed 300 mg every six hours after having 3 wisdom teeth extracted. No issues other than increased vaginal discharge. I definitely don't take it with enough water and usually don't have a meal with it but I have zero complaints about side effects. I'm not sure if it's doing what it's supposed to be but it's day 6 and I don't think I have any signs of infection.,Anna_m
13,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 19, 2017",6,"I was prescribed this medication for after having all my wisdom teeth removed to prevent infection. I took 1 capsule 3 time a day. For the first few days it was fine, I found if you don't take it with a lot of water it burned all the way down and it made me feel funny with a metallic taste in my mouth. Around day 3 I started having cramps in my stomach, back, and right under my ribcage so painful they would keep me up at night and wake me up out of a dead sleep. I was warned that it could cause stomach problems so I didn't think much of it, but it's been a week since I stopped taking them and I'm getting these awful cramps still. Off to the doctor tomorrow for me. (I took probiotics the entire time I was on it and lived off yogurt too)",Sxa4
14,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2017",11,"Consider another drug. Clindamycin has ruined my gut. I have had diarrhea for over a month (tested for c. diff: negative).  The only thing I can eat is peeled white boiled potatoes. Everything else goes through me in just a few hours.  I've lost a lot of weight and I'm permanently tired. My doctor has run all manner of tests and I am just not recovering.  I was a healthy 70kg 31 year old male. Now 62kg one month later. I can't remember being so ill.",ChristopherKay

16,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,1,,"October 2, 2016",9,"Did fine for 10 days on this drug for abscessed tooth. Dentist pulled the tooth & then began the most horrible diarrhea! Dr prescribed Flagyll-but I'm still having issues after weeks! I will never take Clindamycin again! I'm using charcoal & oil of oregano, liquid probiotics & got prayed for at church!

17,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 12, 2016",7,"I was prescribed 300mg Clindamyin 4x daily for 5 days after getting all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed. Took my last dose before going to sleep at midnight last night. The past five days I was doing ok. My Percocet messed me up one day, so I stopped taking that. But today started out fine, until about 11pm when I went to the bathroom. I was in and out of there every 10 minutes or so. Not the usual liquid runs, this was thicker. Maybe everything that had built up from the constipation caused by the Percocet? This went on for a good hour before I downed two probiotic and ran to the store for anti-diarrhea. Now I've got glossy eyes and pink cheeks on an otherwise pale face. Not entirely certain is Clindamycin is to blame, but it's a suspect.",noclight
18,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,1,,"November 10, 2015",14,"Ask Pharmacist if this antibiotic was strong or had any side effects.  He said that is was not considered a strong antibiotic with any serious side effects.  I rarely take antibiotics, avoiding them like the plague just because of bad side effects,  but when I have to take them I always increase my daily intake of probiotics and yogurt.  None of that helped with this miserable drug. I was fine taking this drug the first 3 days, but then on day four I took a pill with Kefir (like yogurt) and had the most severe chest pain I ever had which lasted for over two hours.  Skipped next two doses for the day. Tried one the next morning- had some discomfort. Next dose, more chest pain as if having a heart attack and still have terrible discomfort.",Joey P
19,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,10,,"October 6, 2015",21,"I'm just 2 capsules (150 mg) into a week's prescription. I'm having dental implants and this is to prevent bone infection. Based on the stories here, it's powerful enough to prevent even worse problems! No side effects so far. Scary to read about these issues, so thanks to all for the heads-up! I eat yogurt every day for breakfast anyway but will now up my intake to 3 times a day...yogurt for dessert after every meal! Will keep you posted if anything changes.One week later: The meds are finished and I had no problems! No diarrhea, no nausea, no infection. I was lucky! But I took each pill with a full glass of water, never lay down right after taking it, and I ate plain yogurt 3 times a day, every day, to keep my intestines happy. Good luck",I'm a senior
20,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 2, 2015",11,"I had three wisdom teeth (Third Molars) removed on Monday. I took two Clindamycin (150mg) before the surgery without anything in my stomach and was fine. I was instructed to take 4 a day and therefore took one pill every six hours (This is important) One night I fell asleep before taking it and I noticed I had mild heartburn but once I made sure I did not miss a dose this did not return. REMEMBER to sit up straight for at least 20 minutes to prevent heartburn, this medication is concentrated and you don't want it laying in your stomach. I was warned about diarrhea, and increased my intake of PLAIN GREEK YOGURT and KEFIR. My poo was mucusy, but no diarrhea. Taking precautions and reading instructions will make this medication effective.",MermaidBum

The only side affect for me was, yeast infection. I already take prilosec for heartburn so I didn't notice this side affect.

I managed 8 of the 300mgs capsules which were prescribed 4 daily. What a hellish experience. Severe diarrhoea began following stopping drug after only 8 capsules. it continues.

25,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,1,,"November 19, 2011",30,"2 pills 3x day- 5 days. Got 4 wisdom teeth removed. Day 1- 1st dose, pills were hard to swallow and a few minutes after I took the pills I got an upset stomach. 2nd dose was about the same but I got a rash on my face (cheeks). 3rd dose stomach pain got a little worse. Day 2 stomach pain got even worse with every dose. Day 3 morning dose was unbearably painful in my esophagus/stomach. Called my doctor and he told me to stop taking pills. I figured stomach/esophagus pain would go away since I'm not taking pills but its been 6 days since I stopped taking pills and I still have pain. A lot of pain when I eat and burp. Pain feels like a tightening and burning in my chest every time I swallow. ",lmrod1226
26,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,1,,"February 13, 2011",23,"I was prescribed Clindamycin by my oral surgeon as a prophylactic antibiotic before having my wisdom teeth extracted.  Neither the doctor, pharmacist, nor the drug fact sheet indicated that it could cause severe heartburn or chest pains.  Within a day of taking Clindamycin, I had developed clenching chest / esophageal pain and heartburn.  My doctor extended my Clindamycin script to fight these symptoms.I went to the E.R. this morning for fear that my artificial pulmonary valve was infected.

28,Clindamycin,Surgical Prophylaxis,8,,"February 8, 2010",15,"Clindamycin is a good drug for oral bacteria and since I had a allergy to penicillin, I was prescribed this x 5 days after my oral surgery.  First dose caused terrible heartburn and nausea.  I was very nervous about vomiting after mouth surgery.  The next dose I took with a big glass of water, yogurt and applesauce and sat up for 30 minutes--no problems after that.  Except for watery diarrhea which started day after stopping.  Keeping well hydrated and taking my probiotics should help.",Anonymous
