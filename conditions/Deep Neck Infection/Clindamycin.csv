0,Clindamycin,Deep Neck Infection,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 23, 2020",6,"Because the first two rounds of clindamycin were given intravenously it began to work right away. I was given an oral prescription and three days began with side effects of diarrhea, itching burning skin. I was then put on amoxicillian orally but the affect of clindamycin remained and got worse. Back at hospital 5 times for bowel issues. Hospital not treating me well due to my complaint. This medication should only be given through IV",Ralphi
1,Clindamycin,Deep Neck Infection,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 19, 2018",3,This pill was had to take for me because it sometime wanted to stick to my throat. The it made my already heartburn/GERD worse. The positive side effect is after about 8 days on this antibiotic it brought the infection out of my neck. Unfortunately I had to continue to take it with a refill.,Anonymous
2,Clindamycin,Deep Neck Infection,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2016",7,"It  cured my infection but the  side affects  sent me to the hospital. I got chest tightness, severe heartburn plus the severe pain of swallowing!. My face flushed red. Excruciating head ache for a short time  at the hospital. Also nausea at times. Hospital thought heart attack until it was ruled out. They didn't connect the clindamycin to be a problem. I will never take it again as l also have IBS  and it didn't help. I only have 4 capsules left on the 28  RX",Ms Sunflower
3,Clindamycin,Deep Neck Infection,9,,"June 26, 2013",19,"I was prescribed this medication to treat a serious glandular infection in my neck. An allergy to penicillin made Clindamycin the most effective choice, despite the potential of fairly serious side effects. I followed the dosing instructions, making sure that I took it with something in my stomach (I ate a 1/2 portion of oatmeal porridge 30 minutes before each pill); walked around for a 1/2 hour after taking it; had either an active culture yogurt drink or 1/2 cup of plain yogurt 2 hours after each dose to help restore the bacteria in my gut. I only had minor loose bowel movements at about day 4 and had excellent results in combating the infection. ",Rationl Reviewer
4,Clindamycin,Deep Neck Infection,10,,"October 30, 2009",25,I was precribed the drug for a neck infection.....this antibiotic did not kick in quickly but within the 3rd-4th day it started to work...my wound now is 100% gone.  The only symptoms I had was that I purposely took the drug on an empty stomach (with a lot of water) just to make it more efficient in being assimilated into the body; hence at times my stomach slightly ached for 10-15 min. Nothing painful.  To prevent any potential intestinal issues I included in all my meals natural plain yogurt that had live bacterial cultures.  I experienced no diarrhea this I attribute to the yogurt and probiotic capsules I took religiously.,Anonymous
