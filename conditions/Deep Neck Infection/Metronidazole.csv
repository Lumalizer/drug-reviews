0,Metronidazole,Deep Neck Infection,9,,"November 12, 2014",3,"Used alongside Benzylpenicillin to treat a Peritonsillar Abscess (abscess around the tonsil) caused by MRSA infection and anaerobic bacteria. Was on Intravenous Drip when in hospital with no side effects. Now on oral 400mg with some side effects; nausea, tiredness, metallic taste. It is working well to treat infection. I recommend to anyone who gets PTA",Anonymous
