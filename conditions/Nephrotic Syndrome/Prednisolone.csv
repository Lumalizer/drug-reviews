0,Prednisolone,Nephrotic Syndrome,7,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 17, 2019",2,"It helps with the uncomfortable symptoms of inflammation, increases appetite, and gives more spontanity. The bad side to this medicine is that it somehow alters hormones, not only cortisol, but also sex hormones. If you are a child on this medicine, then you might experience altered development and life long changes to your hormonal algorithms.",Anonymous
1,Prednisolone,Nephrotic Syndrome,9,,"May 16, 2016",2,"My daughter has minimal change disease for many years since 5 years old. She is tolerating prednisolone pretty well with minimal side effects. Yes she is smaller size than her peers but not so small as to be of concern. Her eyes are okay and she did not have cataracts after so many years on this medicine. At this time, she is still dependent on this medicine. Hopefully she grows out of the disease when she reach puberty which is the case for many children with MCD.  Thanks.",Concerned_Father
