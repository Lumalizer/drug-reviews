1,Prednisone,Nephrotic Syndrome,7,,"March 27, 2016",1,"prednisone did help my 2yrs old daughter go into remission with nephrotic syndrome thank god , and she was on lasiks and melatonin and blood pressure meds for a short time . the side effects were weight gain, spurts of anger and aggression and a lot of whinning . she completely changed ! I'm definetly looking into other meds if this does come back . do your homework and check statistics on meds and how many children have been tested using all the meds . thanks",caring parent 13
2,Prednisone,Nephrotic Syndrome,6,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 20, 2015",3,"It definitely works well for lowering protein in the urine and facial/digital swelling, yeah. It's good in that sense, and pretty bad in any other. Very noticeable side effects I've experienced include aggression, increased appetite (which once made me fairly overweight), uneven distribution of fat (mostly in the gut and neck), trouble breathing, a constant need to yawn, short breath, wheezing, acne, and high blood pressure. I've had to take more medications just to combat the side effects. It's not always too fast in encouraging urination either, I've had to take diuretics along with it. It also tastes terrible. Like, really really bad.",PinkPuppy
