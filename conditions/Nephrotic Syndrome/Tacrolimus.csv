0,Tacrolimus,Nephrotic Syndrome,7.0,,"April 11, 2019",2,"I am now 57 years old and I had a kidney transplant 5 mths ago, and am now on tacrolimus.  However the question is about nephrotic syndrome, which I previously had from the age of 18 mths.  I was mainly treated with varying doses of the steroid prednisolone for circa 50 years.  However in the 80's I received cyclosporin, another powerful anti rejection drug, which seems to be used less often today, in favour of tacro.  Unfortunately a side affect of years of taking cyclosporin was that it increased my creatinine levels (damaging the kidney), and when levels rose to around 150 they stopped it, and resumed steroids, then at a much lower dose (5mg instead of 20 daily).  The point is that 'for me' it was a tricky decision of how long to stay on the cyclosporin, and the damage it causes to creatinine levels, against increased amounts of steroid.  Eventually almost 30 yrs later further damage made it inevitable that I needed a transplant, that was received from my step Dad).I'm in UK so our great NHS covered my costs.",stexx
1,Tacrolimus,Nephrotic Syndrome,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 20, 2018",1,My son has been on tacrolimus for 5yrs he is 14 and has Neprotic syndrome never( had a transplant) and his urine always shows that he has protein leaking when results come back. When Dr sees him he looks fine.but when the labs come back they're not good. I read all the reviews and it looks like you all had transplants and it helps . I cant understand why this isn't working for him. The pills get bigger and smaller and its the same tacrolimus? Can anyone tell me if its the size of the pills .,Neprotic syndrome
