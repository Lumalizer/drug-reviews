1,Mycophenolate mofetil,Nephrotic Syndrome,9,,"October 17, 2014",43,"CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil):I was reluctant to take this medication but essentially had no choice when faced with the possibility of losing my kidneys. It saved my kidneys and also helped greatly with my other SLE symptoms (joint pain, neuropathy and lung issues to name a few). I also can't tolerate steroids, so luckily CellCept combined with Plaquenil has kept things under control without having to add Prednisone in the mix. I did experience some issues with dizziness, hair loss and insomnia, but they have tapered off after being on it for a year now; still have problems sleeping at times though and am now experiencing some anxiety. I'm also concerned about the long term effects ie. lymphoma risks and it's very expensive, but overall it saved my life.",Smed
