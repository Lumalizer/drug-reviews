3,Brilinta,Coronary Artery Disease,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2020",14,11/15/2020Placed on Brilinta post two stent placements.  Took it for one week and noted memory problems and I started itching and burning around my face and head.  Physician assistant said not a problem and I continued to take it three more days.  Three days later in the middle of the night I went to the emergency room at 3am with uncontrollable itching and severe shortness of breath and severe chest pain.  I was told I was on my way to a heart attack from the Brilinta.   I was admitted and switched to plavix.  Three days after switching to plavix and still itching and memory problems. Supposedly it takes as long as seven days to recover from an allergic reaction to Britlnta.   Too soon to evaluate the plavlx .,Dee
4,Brilinta,Coronary Artery Disease,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 27, 2020",5,My experience with this Brilinta drug is much like the others that are negative. This drug made me so irritable and anxious. It kept me up most of the night after my second dose of 90 mg. I felt totally separated from myself and confused. The side effect list is as long as your arm. I called my Dr. the next day after a miserable night and he switched my to plavix. No apparent problems as of yet. I will never take this particular medicine again. Besides it's expensive IF you can even afford it.,Jman
5,Brilinta,Coronary Artery Disease,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 5, 2020",18,"I had a stent placed in my artery that was 90% blocked. They put me on Brilinta and 2 days into it I developed shortness of breath and a terrible feeling of claustrophobia but not of small spaces but of feeling it with myself, I felt I needed to get out myself somehow, it was a very strange feeling . I have asthma as well so took a puff of Ventolin and 5 minutes later my heart was racing and I continued to have shortness of breath. Had to go to hospital. They took me off Brilinta and put me on Clopidogrel. No problems thus far apart from the anxiety I feel, I feel like I'm going out of my mind. Hopefully anxiety is just the lingering affects of Brilinta.",Rick

7,Brilinta,Coronary Artery Disease,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 6, 2020",9,"Had stents put in so Dr gave me brilinta. Had side effects of a very hard time breathing, could not sleep for shortness of breath. Walked into my living one evening and lost my breath  fell to my knees in front of my chair. My son said he asked me three times if I was ok. Did not hear him. Spent the night in the hospital. They said it was the brilinta. Put me on plavix. Now I feel great. Brilinta should not be on the market. It cost me 564$for three month supply. Got the plavix for 8$ For three month supply. They ought to be made to refund my money. Dumped them down the toilet.",Bato
