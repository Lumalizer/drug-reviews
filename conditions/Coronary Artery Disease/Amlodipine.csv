0,Amlodipine,Coronary Artery Disease,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 11, 2016",40,"I was prescribed 10mg Amlodipine to treat Coronary artery spasm after 2 myocardial infarctions at 35 and 37 years. First came nausea, which lasted about 2 weeks, however, the chronic insomnia and horrific, extremely vivid nightmares began almost immediately and are still persisting even though I stopped taking it about 6 days ago. Another side effect I experienced was extremely stiff and sore feet - I thought I had developed painful arthritis overnight and walking on them was horrible. I also experienced extreme fatigue all day every day, making it near impossible to care for my three children at home who are all under school age. I thought I was losing my mind. Feeling a bit better every day. This was a very scary experience for me.",carmenrecall
