1,Lisinopril,Coronary Artery Disease,2,,"November 28, 2009",47,"My friend age 53 began taking Lisinopril after a double coronary bypass June this year. We asked for the Lisinopril prescription from the doctor because it was cheap and he was going to need a long term ACE inhibitor. He had a history of bronchitis in the past. As time rocked on the cough became worse eventually being put on a home nebulizer. The Physician Assistant changed him from Lisinopril to Diovan. Within 2 weeks the cough had gone away, as well as the wheezing and no longer needed the resp treatments. Personally I feel that Lisinopril is a good medicine if one has no other medical issues. In this case I think it was not a good choice. ",Bailey1957
