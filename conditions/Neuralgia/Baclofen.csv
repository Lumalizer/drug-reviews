0,Baclofen,Neuralgia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 18, 2022",1,"I suffered both chronic and acute pain, apparently in one of my hips, but radiating through my leg for many months. I was reduced to climbing stairs a half step at a time. An MRI showed stenosis of my lower spine, but before the MRI, I developed severe muscle spasm of Gluteus muscles. I was prescribed Baclofen (Lioresal) as a an antispasmodic, but my other symptoms were quickly relieved.The initial dosage of 10 mg t.i.d. was excessive for my low body weight and gave me severe headaches and destroyed my co-ordination. I gradually reduced the dosage and find that 5 mg once each morning works most days to keep my symptoms under control. If pain recurs I take an additional 5 mg, plus 325 mg of Acetaminophen - I also use this combination an hour before strenuous sporting exercise. I am male and in my mid 70's.",Alberni
1,Baclofen,Neuralgia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 17, 2021",1,"My experience with this medication has been all positive as I couldn't speak and no brain function working but now I am doing well and almost back to normal, not to say my symptoms have gone all together but are manageable on the right dosage. 10/10",Miss j
2,Baclofen,Neuralgia,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2020",2,"Take baclofen with CAUTION Took the recommended dosage, after approximately an hour had to urinate. I recall sitting on the toilet, the next thing I remember was coming to, on the floor. I really could have injured myself. Carried on but taking only a half tablet as the nerve pain was nearly unbearable, and didnâ€™t want to deal with going back to Dr then pharmacy etc., etc.",RAWarrior
3,Baclofen,Neuralgia,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 7, 2019",22,I have MS and have been taking Baclofen for a one of my symptoms for few years.  I have an overactive and painful parotid gland that gets a lot worse depending on the atmospheric pressure.  I was erroneously diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia and was prescribed Gabapentin.  That put me in a fog.  I switched neurologists when I moved and he put me on Baclofen for this symptom.  I do not take this regularly but do take it if I feel the pain intensifying or if I know a storm front is approaching.Baclofen almost eliminates my pain.  I can function as normal no matter what the weather.  This medication has helped me maintain a normal lifestyle despite my MS.,Shakalaka

7,Baclofen,Neuralgia,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 2, 2017",18,"Lioresal (baclofen):I have been taking lioresal (baclofen) 10mg 3 x per day, for 3 days now. The side effects are immense! After 20 mins I lose all sense of balance, get a major headache, and need to urinate frequently (which is difficult when lack of balance screws up walking ability!) It knocks me out for hours. Side effects last approx 6 hrs. I have cut down to twice a day now because I can't handle the side effects. Only positive is the pain eases (I have intercostal neuralgia) but not 100% pain relief- maybe 70%. I plan to visit the Dr and get off it asap.",Slord

9,Baclofen,Neuralgia,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 27, 2016",23,"I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and neuropathy. I was in horrible pain all I did was lay in bed and the spasms through my whole body were just horrific. The neurologist put me on 10 mg of baclofen to start, finally moving up to 20 mg a day. It brought my quality of life completely back.it took the neuropathy completely away and quite a bit of the pain from the fibromyalgia. When I got the prescription filled the first 90 day prescription of baclofen was made by a company called IVAX And as I stated worked very well. When I went in for a refill the pharmacy gave me baclofen made by LANNETT and it had a horrible side effects, I brought it back and they exchanged it for the original baclofen made by IVAX Since then I've had no problems.",DELBRO

I was so sick to my stomach that even water made me even more sick. Whatever I ate or drank would come back up about an hour later. I could barely stand up straight, I was shaking, I had fever and chills, etc. It was horrible! I stopped taking it as soon as this started and then it took another two days to actually completely get out of my system!",gizzmoe
12,Baclofen,Neuralgia,8.0,,"July 5, 2015",47,"I have suffered with pain from lower back disk bulging for several years. The nerves being pinched send pain and extreme stiffness to my left hip all the way down my leg to the front of my shin. I am very active, and my job requires a good deal of physical work. Baclofen in combonation with Gabapentin has given me such relief without the side effects of opium class drugs. I urge you to speak to your doctor about these medications. They may help you with your pain. By the way I am 50 yrs old.",Wastewater/mjd

14,Baclofen,Neuralgia,8.0,,"June 13, 2010",34,"I take baclofen for extreme pain in shoulder and arm due to compressed neck vertebrae. I had tried Flexeril and Robaxin and received no relief.  When I first began taking this I couldn't sleep, had a headache and as I read a review by another person - fell asleep mid sentence. My boss said I was hard to get to understand things but very agreeable. All are getting better. I have very vivid dreams now and wake about every 3 or 4 hours to go to the bathroom - that I was doing prior to the drug. What I call ""pee pee pads"" are very important but I used them prior to taking Baclofen. Overall, this medicine seems to help most of the time. I take it just before leaving for work just in case I might have trouble driving. Works well.",Anonymous
