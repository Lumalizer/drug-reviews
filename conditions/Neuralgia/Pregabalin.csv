0,Pregabalin,Neuralgia,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 2, 2022",0,"I was prescribed pregabalin at 25mg as needed for TN, and over 5 years or so, reached max dose 600mg. Tolerance had become a huge problem. While it worked, it was tremendous and was my only shield and comfort against nerve pain. It eradicated anxiety, boosted my motivation, elevated my mood and enabled me to pursue a life worth living. However, I urge anybody to not take high doses, and not for long periods of time. The withdrawal from this drug took me 14 months and it was nothing but unimaginable nightmare. In that time I lost my relationship, job, and sanity. Those things, anxiety, motivation, enthusiasm, were all at a ridiculous deficit for one thing. Crippling lows. Round-the-clock nausea and headaches. It changes your metabolism and brain chemistry. Have insulin resistance and chronic migraine as a result. I did however recover from memory and speech issues. Go VERY slow when you taper off! In short bursts, however, it is a magic bullet for many afflictions. Potent stuff.",Iroquois

3,Pregabalin,Neuralgia,1.0,,"February 3, 2020",119,"Lyrica (pregabalin):Lyrica/Pregabalin was prescribed to me when I had a swollen and non-diagnosed node on my neck. After 10 months, and nearly wiping out 6 months of research during my PhD, I visited a doctor in Chicago who warned me to taper down and get off the drug. I do not normally take medicines of any kind, other than antibiotics in the event of a serious bacterial infection. Based on my experience with Lyrica, I would not recommend it to anyone. Pfizer's multiple trials for this drug have been designed to try to offer it for every imaginable and even unimaginable problem. It numbs the brain and turns a person into a blithering idiot while also catalyzing side-effects that range from nervous tics to suicidal ideation. Ten years later, I still have a mild, but irritating bruxism and semi-uncontrollable mouth movements. Rating the drug effective or ineffective is irrelevant. It will produce a numbing euphoria so that a person doesn't even have the sense to stop it.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.",mbmss
4,Pregabalin,Neuralgia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 19, 2020",65,"Lyrica (pregabalin):I got severe trigeminal neuralgia 40yrs ago. After 10yrs on Tegratol I had MVD operation. It was quite an experience on its own. From the moment I opened my eyes the pain was gone - until 2 months ago (nearly 30yrs later). It's not as severe as previous, but it was back, and moved from the lower jaw to the top one. I went onto Lyrica stating at 25mg twice a day, slowly increasing to 75mg doses. It took about 3 weeks to work, but now I am pain free. The side effects haven't been too bad to date. It is a winner. I missed a dose once and got slight tingling reminders.

I suffer from electric shock like pains in my face that can last up to 2 hours.  I was prescribed Lyrica 75mg twice a day.  Did not work.  The Doctor then increased it to 150mg then 300mg twice a day.  I hate the side effects of feeling tired and forgetful but the medication has helped me up until recently.  The pain has returned with a vengeance and I'm on the maximum dosage already.  Nothing helps now,Lou
6,Pregabalin,Neuralgia,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 22, 2019",37,Lyrica (pregabalin):Initially put on Lyrica for severe lower back pain 75mg twice daily. Miraculous cure. Over time had to increase to 150mg - still brilliant. About 10 years ago had first attack of trigeminal neuralgia - which made the severe back pain feel like being tickled with a feather. When suffering a trigeminal attack nowadays the combination of Lyrica 150mgs twice daily plus six hourly 50 mg Tramadol and six hourly 2x 500mg paracetamol just about reduces the pain to survivable levels. Without the Lyrica I'd be crying like a baby for the duration of the attack. The only noticeable side effect of the Lyrica is occasional vertigo. A small price to pay in my view.,Zombie

The doctor advised start a 75mg and double after a week but after reading many bad reviews at high dosage I decided to start at 75 and see. I needed to increase to 100mg a day but the relief is amazing and lifesaving. My pain has been reduced so much - it’s still there but I can handle it and from where it was it’s amaizing. Even after 6 weeks I felt it improve again without upping the dose so start low and stay with it and I have had no side effects other than it makes me less anxious and happier - I love it,Happycustomer

I can literally feel the nerve from my neck running through the shoulder down the arm and into my hand. Each of these problems trigger the other causing severe pain and constant chronic migraines. I had been on gabapentin for several years and did not see any help with recent increases. I hurt 24/7 at an average of 6/7 with all the medications I was on including the gabapentin. I had started Botox in January 2018. Had also started experiencing symptoms pointing to fibromyalgia, but have not been diagnosed. Too many doctor visits as it is.

Went to the dentist got an xray done and no cavities, nothing wrong. So I started doing my own research (googling my symptoms) and read about nerve pain. I immediately got in contact with my neurologist to come in and get seen. I also have epilepsy, chronic migraines, and the list goes on. When I picked up the med from the pharmacy I had asked how long it would be before I could get relief and the pharmacist said probably 3 or 4 days. I was feeling great after 2 doses of lyrica.

14,Pregabalin,Neuralgia,10.0,,"July 17, 2018",44,"Lyrica (pregabalin):I was eating a burger in 2011 and experienced a stabbing pain on the upper right side of my jaw. It felt like someone had stuck an ice pick in my face and slowly pulled it out. After two checks with my dentist I was told there was nothing wrong with my teeth or gums. The pain continued but was always sporadic - when I ate, when I talked, when I shaved, when the wind blew a certain way. The bouts became more frequent and I had trouble sleeping as I would wake up to sudden jolts of pain. A month later they were so continuous that I could not go to work. A visit to my GP resulted in a quick diagnosis of Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and a prescription for  Lyrica. My dose level was quite high(600mg).  The pain disappeared completely, but I self medicated the dose down to 75mg daily and have had great results. For the most part I am pain free with short bouts of pain that I cannot find a root cause for. Have not had ANY side effects.",Jack

52,Pregabalin,Neuralgia,7.0,,"August 25, 2009",42,Lyrica (pregabalin):Makes me feel very sleepy and spaced out but really helps with the pain. Also have an increase in appetite. Had total knee replacement three months ago and have a lot of post operative nerve pain that tramadol didn't touch. After many sleepless nights it has been a God send and have had my first night of more than three hours sleep since I had the operation.,katzeyz
53,Pregabalin,Neuralgia,8.0,,"July 9, 2009",47,Lyrica (pregabalin):I have nerve damage in my L4 / L5 disc and down my leg. Out of all my medicines the one that helps me the most is Lyrica. I can tell if I miss a pill because my pain goes up. The pain medicines just hide the pain and not that well on cold and rainy days. Lyrica helps the pain - it is the best nerve medicine I have ever had. I gained 40 lbs. I have been on Neurontin with lots of side effects. As much as I hate the 40 lbs I'm glad to have the medicine.,Anonymous

56,Pregabalin,Neuralgia,4.0,,"April 15, 2009",31,Lyrica (pregabalin):I was recently put on this medication - only 25 mg to start for the first week. Since about the third day of taking the low dose of this medication I suddenly began to be extremely tired. I was not feeling like myself at all. I had to leave work early one day and was off for the rest of the week. I also slept for about one whole day. My doctor is aware and wants me to stick with the low dose for now since I am still feeling pretty lethargic during the 3rd week. I hope that it will get better soon. ,99
57,Pregabalin,Neuralgia,9.0,,"April 1, 2009",29,Lyrica (pregabalin):I am 52 years old and have suffered from neuralgia mostly in my feet and legs.  It got so bad I could not fall asleep at night.  I take 50mg morning and night.  I read all the comments and reviews on this and other sites. They made it sound like a miracle drug and I agree. Finally I had some relief. I am having trouble with swelling and had some weight gain.  It has been worth it.,CindyatWTS
58,Pregabalin,Neuralgia,9.0,,"February 6, 2009",48,"Lyrica (pregabalin):After the shingles on my neck I was diagnosed with ""non specific nerualgia"" because having shingles on my neck the virus infected my trigemengial nerve and the chances of the pain going away are far to none. I have tried everything from trigger point injections to high doses of opioids. Nothing really worked on the underlying pain. Yes I would have some relief but the nerve pain was always there. So now after being on maintanence methadone for a year I have started taking lyrica for the past month with really good results. Now I am starting to slowly to come down off the methadone because of the great results from this medication. I was pleasantly surprised. I just hope it can continue the good work.",prknz
