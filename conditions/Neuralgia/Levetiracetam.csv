1,Levetiracetam,Neuralgia,9,,"September 20, 2016",13, Originally I was taking gabapentin which helped a little but ended up making my pre existing tinnitus much much worse. I started doing my own research as my doctor wanted to give me Lyrica or Cymbalta both of which are a big no no for tinnitus patients. I stumbled across Keppra and found a few studies done for nerve pain. I also found that Keppra is the only anti epileptic on the market without tinnitus listed as a side effect. I approached my doctor about this and she agreed to let me give it a try. I started off at 500mg twice a day and now take 750mg twice a day. It has done wonders for my nerve pain! I have managed to have pain free days/weeks and minimal pain over all with no side effect,GhoulGoneWild
