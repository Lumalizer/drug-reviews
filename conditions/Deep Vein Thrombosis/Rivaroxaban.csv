As far as I know it worked, but I have another 45 days to continue taking it. My concern is the side effects. It completely took away my desire to eat, if I force myself to eat I have to eat in tiny portions and I can't eat any thing with gluten. I get deathly Ill. Even From things I have ate all my life. I would not agree to taking this drug again. My Dr just ignores my concerns. I have lost over 20 pounds. Plus I can't sleep normally. It has been a terrible experience!",Not happy

I developed looked like hives or rashes on both of my inner thighs. My doctor said that it looked like eczema. I  used all kinds of otc lotion to ease the itch and some pain but never went away.  When xarelto was introduced to the market My doctor said that I am a good candidate for it. Few months  after taking 20 mg. a day  itch on my upper arms started At the time it did not bother me because that was the least of my problems. In 2012 I noticed some red bumps on my lower leg and a bit itchy. It went away after few weeks. But my body itch continues. In the spring of 2020 the itch and red bumps intensified and appeared all over my body.  My doctor said it’s not from xarelto. The dermatologist could not recognize what these red spots on my body. I have to wear long sleeves even in the summertime to cover the red bumps and lesions that turned to dark brown spot all over my arms and body.,paopaoanddahlia1207

I cannot get an appointment to see a hematologist until 4 days before the surgery. The last couple days the bleeding has stopped but the pain in my leg is much worse making it difficult to walk.

Had to have emergency surgery because a clot broke off and was blocking the left artery of my heart. After 8 days in the hospital I was put on Xarelto. Started out as 15 mg twice a day to 20mg once a day. Was originally supposed to be on it for 6 months but my insurance wasn’t approving my follow up CT scan and ultrasound. Ended up being on it for a year and 6 months. While taking Xarelto, I experienced numbness and tingling in the leg where the clots were, horrible anxiety, leg swelling, leg pain, heavy menstrual cycles, and bruising. I recently stopped the drug cold turkey, doctors orders. Anxiety has gotten worse as I’m afraid of experiencing another DVT/PE. Overall it did the job. No sign of clots in legs or lungs.",Khali

Recently had DVT in arm. 1st tablet caused burning nerves in face & spine rushed to A &E who were dumbfounded.Within 1 week i was pacing the house all night. Heart racing severely.

Pacing house 16 hours a day, paranoia, intense pressure in head, muscle spasms, unable to close eyes. Nerves on skin . Reduced dose didn't help improve situation. Eventually doctor switched me to Eliquis which I'm absolutely fine on. I believe this drug is ok for a lot of people, however if you have a reaction its severe. Lost over a stone in 3 weeks, hyperventilated daily, my behaviour and personality changed dramatically.Within 48 hours on Eliquis all symptoms ceased.

My Primary Dr immediately started me on Xarelto (2 15 mg for 21 days, then 1 20mg daily that I am still taking.) After just 2 doses I began to feel the most sleepiness I have ever had. It is still continuing to this day, even when I do not feel sleepy, I wake up 2-3 hours later not even realizing I fell asleep! I am also on several anti-depressants, incl. Prozac and my depression & lack of ambition goes right along with my sleepiness. I am fedling a bit better since the surgery, yet I have no desire to do much of anything. I experience nausea, and a lack of appetite as well. Still have 8 weeks to continue taking this drug, and I pray I can bounce back to my energetic, busy old self.

15,Rivaroxaban,Deep Vein Thrombosis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 7, 2019",20,"Xarelto (rivaroxaban):This drug did great for resolving a clot in a deep vein in my right leg. At the six month mark when I was cleared to come off it, no one ever told me, nor any of the safety literature indicated that what happened could happen. After one day of stopping Xarelto I was so instantly fatigued and sick I couldn’t function for days. It made my blood pressure spike and I had to see a doc about getting that under control. It finally took about 10 days for that medicine to let me go and trust me it was a miserable 10 days. A vascular surgeon and a cardiologist both told me they’ve never heard of this side effect. Kind of scary that this kind of stuff is not out there for patients to see early. Also, I consider it dangerous because where I live  there is no reversing agent available. If you decide to take Xarelto you would be better off going to Vegas and betting on a dice throw. Your chances are better. If I need another blood thinner I will go with the tried and tested Coumadin. It’s safer.",Machoo

I believe this drug is the reason I feel severe vein pain in my left arm, behind me knee, and below my knee. I also believe that it causes swelling in the tissues around my brain stem.   I believe the Xarelto I take is causing this swelling, which is causing the decreased respirations which wake me up. I experience SEVERE agitation an anxiety when I try to put hours i nbetween my doses to wean myself off. I CAN NOT wean myself off. .

I didn't have any side effects that I am aware of while on Xeralto luckily. Doctor told me stay active (I sit 8 hours a day at work connected to a computer and phone) so I am sure this is why I got the clots to start with. I move my legs around under my desk and stand up for a few minutes every hour or two when I can. Will see what happens from here.",thegizkitty

It also caused my iron level to drop to 17!  I stayed on Xarelto for 6 months and it worked for me.  I was told Xarelto won't dissolve your clot it just thins your blood enough to prevent the clot from growing or new clots, The existing clot is absorbed into the body.

Tried Warfarin with many headaches, stopped on my own due to the side effect.  That's how the DVT came back.  Went to Coumadin and the difference was Coumadin gave me a consistent test result.  Still the headaches almost daily.  From minimal to taking 800 mg of ibuprofen, just to get rid of the pain.  Already allergic to peanuts, then restricted by medicine with no greens or cranberry.  Really tough to find a good meal.  Begged my doctor for a prescription before it was approved for DVT and that could be part of my positive reaction.  Now on Xarelto for 2 years, headaches once in awhile - maybe due to medicine but not consistent enough to believe.  Eat anything and everything.",Tsunamijim

The period was severe bleeding 6 days straight, at that point I went to the ER, I ended up with several blood transfusions that were not helping, my hemoglobin was dropping to dangerous levels. The only thing to be done was an emergency uterine ablation. I believe that blood levels DO actually need to be monitored. My blood was so thin I was not clotting. ",Sarah v
