0,Pradaxa,Deep Vein Thrombosis,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 24, 2021",0,"I take Pradaxa for a blood clotting disease I’ve had for years. It does prevent clots as long as I stay on it, (2 -150 mg/day). However, I’ve had a plethora of negative symptoms from Pradaxa. Acid reflux, severe heart burn unless taken with food or a glass of milk. Feels like someone lit a torch in my throat. Severe hair loss, regardless of what scientific tests may say otherwise. Texture of hair is brittle on Pradaxa versus when I’ve gone off of it. Those who’ve commented on difficulties opening the bottle are correct. Very difficult to open, especially the first couple times on a new bottle. Joints ache, hip and back pain much worse when on this medication. I can’t take any anti-inflammatories while on Pradaxa for the severe hip and back pain, and as others here have mentioned, Tylenol doesn’t phase this pain. Bloating, and now gastrointestinal issues. Have never been constipated but I am now and yesterday began bleeding rectally. Scary!",Anonymous
1,Pradaxa,Deep Vein Thrombosis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 9, 2020",12,"I have a  Factor V Leiden gene that makes me more susceptible to blood clotting, After having multiple DVT's in my leg, I was put on Coumadin.  After a year Coumadin was causing random large bruises at random places.  I switched to Pradaxa a year ago and could not be happier. No Bruising at all,  no nose bleeds either.  Cuts do bleed a while, but not like they did with coumadin.  Not having to monitor my intake of Greens and not having to get constant blood tests are so nice.  If you are on Coumadin, switch to Pradaxa NOW.   (I take my pradaxa with my meal and do not have heart burn)",JMcW
2,Pradaxa,Deep Vein Thrombosis,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 11, 2017",21,"I'd have to say that I'm of a mixed opinion on Pradaxa. While I know that a blood thinner is necessary in my life, given my current condition, the downside to any of them is frustrating. Pradaxa's downsides seem to be fairly minimal and as a result is the drug I've chosen.  I really like the ability to reverse the effects with a single dose of a counter drug. Where I've run into problems with it is primarily digestive. The acidic nature of the med has caused some stomach upset but more significantly diarrhea, loose stools and leakage. This has led to abrasion bleeding externally and problems with cleanliness. Recently, my doctor recommended  omeprazole to counter this effect and it appears to be working adequately.",OldMoose2
3,Pradaxa,Deep Vein Thrombosis,9.0,,"November 17, 2016",25,There is an important bit of misinformation presented by several of these commenters.  The effects of both Pradaxa and Coumidin are reversible.  Those of Xaralta and Eliquis are not.  It seems like the issues with heartburn/acid reflux are minimized by either drinking lots of liquid with the pill or eating some food and then taking an anti-acid within the hour.,reb85
4,Pradaxa,Deep Vein Thrombosis,4.0,,"October 29, 2015",15,"I have taken Pradaxa for 6 months and have started having severe back pain in the lower back and also in the hipbones.  Stopped taking it AMA and the pain lessened significantly.  Another ultrasound showed that the clot has moved from calf to thigh so although my leg feels 90% better, the clot is still present and on the move.",Geek_Lady
5,Pradaxa,Deep Vein Thrombosis,6.0,,"September 23, 2015",13,"After travel by car, I felt the DVT symptoms, having had a previous occurrence 4 years ago. Pradaxa was offered as a choice, so that I would not have to return for the frequent pro-time tests. It has worked fine for a while, had reflux before and after starting to take.  Upside, the leg with the clot feels better and is not as swollen, and I am not having the irregular heart beat with dizziness.  Fewer headaches.  Downside:  my bones ache.  My hips and my thumb hurt.  Even my teeth and jaw are starting to ache.  Since there are no other meds except long term thyroid replacements, I feel this is the cause. Feel swollen around my abdomen.   And Acetaminophen doesn't work well for low back and other pains.",GeekyLady
6,Pradaxa,Deep Vein Thrombosis,8.0,,"November 3, 2014",18,"Heartburn other than that tolerable after being on warfarin for 28 yrs, love the fact no constant visits for protime testing.",Delsha
7,Pradaxa,Deep Vein Thrombosis,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 15, 2014",35,I've been on 2x150mg Pradaxa for about 1 year now after being on 14 mg of warfarin for a year before this. I had a DVT followed by a Protein S deficiency diagnosis.  I felt really tired/sluggish on warfarin and didn't like the inconvenience of INR testing. I feel better on Pradaxa but I am considering switching back to warfarin because I don't like the idea that there is no antidote for E.R. bleeding with Pradaxa. I work with saws all the time and this is a constant concern.,Slarso
