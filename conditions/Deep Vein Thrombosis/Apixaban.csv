4,Apixaban,Deep Vein Thrombosis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 27, 2021",4,"Eliquis (apixaban):Absolutely despise this expensive drug with so many side effects.  I experienced frequent urination (almost hourly at night) itchy red rashes forearm and upper arm, gas, easy bruising, onset of a mild headache for someone like me who NEVER got headaches.  I was prescribed it for a lower leg DVT, initially 2- 5MG tablets twice a day for a week, then 1- 5 MG tablet twice a day.After 6 weeks I began a gradual tapering off (AMA of course, against medical advice)  My plan of action was to increase my daily water intake by 400% (used to just drink maybe 8 ounces, plus tea, juice, fruits and veggies (which do count for water intake) reduce oily fatty processed foods, and add additional speed walks throughout the day and early eve as my exercise regimen. I believe these changes will prevent any new blood clots.  All side effects went away within 36 hours of stopping the medication.",BG
5,Apixaban,Deep Vein Thrombosis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2021",1,Eliquis (apixaban):My son was put on Eliquis one week ago for a DVT in his leg. He is asplenic 6 years ago. He got babesiosis microti from a tick bite. He was diagnosed on June 30th 2021.  His DVT was ascertained on July 16 after his Second hospitalization. He was admitted on July 21st for chest pain when breathing. It was not cardiac related through the whole hospitalization process. It was clearly pain on taking breath’s which required him to do shallow breathing. His pain was in his chest that went to left shoulder. Eliquis was started on 7/16/2021 and his symptoms started on the evening of July 20th. He is 30 years old this past May 2021. Just curious if the Eliquis is responsible or an additional factor that caused this to happen. I am acutely aware that the babesiosis microti  is a extremely life-threatening illness for somebody who is without a spleen.,Mom

8,Apixaban,Deep Vein Thrombosis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 21, 2020",1,I had first DVT in 1990 I was treated with heparin injection then after one month with Coumadin for 6 months after that Dr told me to stop it after my blood test came ok then after 8 years I had second DVT in the same leg (left) one but in that time I had surgery Dr did the Vena Cava Filter and they put me in warfarin again for the rest of my life because the blood test came I have 2 low proteins C and S in my blood that’s why I'm prone to blood clot but after many years with warfarin that I heated a lot because you have a lots of restrictions and you got to do blood test any time so when I heard about Eliquis I asked my Hematologists Dr to put me in and it was a great relief for me now is 10 years and I’m very happy with it and I really recommend it.,Jennifer

12,Apixaban,Deep Vein Thrombosis,2.0,,"June 2, 2020",84,"Eliquis (apixaban):I was prescribed Eliquis after experiencing an upper extremity deep vein thrombosis due to thoracic outlet syndrome.  The clot was dissolved in hospital through thrombolysis.  I was sent home with Eliquis 10 mgs. x2 per day for a week, then 5 mgs x2 per day for maintenance.  I didn't realize how horrible this drug made me feel until I called my hematologist after 3 months and begged him to reduce the dose.  I experienced extreme fatigue, depression/apathy, muscle pain all over my body, and joint pain that would keep me up at night in my hips and lower back.  My whole body began to hurt all the time after about 5 weeks on the medication.  I couldn't do any exercise without being unable to get out of a chair for days afterwards.  Not to mention the horrible heartburn.  Fortunately, I see a TOS expert soon, and fingers crossed will be able to drop the Eliquis entirely.  Has been an awful experience.",Phoebe

My whole body shakes on and off throughout the day, usually when resting. It only lasts a few seconds and then stops, but this happens repeatedly during the day and sometimes when I am trying to sleep. Is this a side effect of this drug as I cannot find it on the leaflet?

20,Apixaban,Deep Vein Thrombosis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 16, 2020",33,"Eliquis (apixaban):I had a blood clot in abdominal superior mesenteric artery. I was prescribed Eliquis following open surgery to bypass thrombosed SMA artery in the abdomen. Side effects for me are predominantly GI related: severe abdominal/intestinal cramping/pain within 20-40 min after taking it & which lasts a couple hours. It has been confirmed I am now getting adequate blood to my GI system since surgery, so that is not the problem. Bloating and gas are also a problem since taking Eliquis for 2 1/2 months.Hoping my cardiologist will agree to switch me to a different option, even if it means INR blood tests. I had lots of GI issues  prior to surgery that affected my quality of life. Albeit the GI issues I now have are different than pre-bypass, Eliquis is a key factor in my continued reduced quality of life.",Bowritet

I have gained over 30 pounds in 5 months. The weight is weird, I can feel my legs swelling at various times during the day and then feel the release. It scares me. Sometimes it feels like my skin is so tight it will rip if I bend my knees. My dr states it’s better than having a clot. I’m not so sure. I feel like a guinea pig. I tell him the weight is from the medication and he states there have been no reports of weight gain from Eliquis. Well that’s probably because the medical community doesn’t want to report it.

The doctor originally put me on Xarelto and that was a disaster Dr had to take me off of it after 3 weeks and we switched to Eliquis.  Almost immediately after beginning to take Eliquis I start to have random itching sensations all over by body.  At first I didn’t think anything of it, but after 4 weeks on it I started to have uncontrollable itching late at night and extreme swelling in hands and feet due to the scratching.  I would also develop hives and what looked like diaper rash all over my body.  Luckily between the two drugs the clot is gone and I am back on aspirin.  I have only been off of Eliquis for 5 days and some of the rash and itching has gotten better but not yet gone.   I think some of the interactions seemed to be related to what I would eat.",Archie
