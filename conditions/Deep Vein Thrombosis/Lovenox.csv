0,Lovenox,Deep Vein Thrombosis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2020",7,"Was the only drug that would thin my blood well enough to get out of hospital. Was not thrilled about giving myself shots but it beats staying in hospital.  The site of injection does bruise but I had no, too little, pain.   And odd thing about the drug is that after injection there is no pain but wait a few seconds and you feel a slight burning sensation.  Still on the medication and other than headaches, I have no side effects.  Was glad to give myself the injections in order to leave the hospital.",kfo9494

4,Lovenox,Deep Vein Thrombosis,9.0,,"December 24, 2011",38,"It is the only medicine that I can take to assist with the fighting of DVT for me. Don't care for sticking myself everyday, although it is keeping me alive. I have tried Coumadin and Praxada, but with both became severely ill, so the only choice was Lovenox. Am looking for the option of going back to a pill or some other treatment one day, instead of injections.  ",Anonymous

6,Lovenox,Deep Vein Thrombosis,,,"November 1, 2009",54,"I have been on Lovenox since June 1996, after two Pulmonary Embolisms. On Coumadin. I draw from 300ml vials twice a day using 31 guage needles from B-D.  Using the pre-filled needles are too large.  Inject very slow reduces bruising at the injection site.  I inject my legs as well as my belly and rotate around to reduce sore spots.",Terry Wade
7,Lovenox,Deep Vein Thrombosis,8.0,,"September 3, 2009",49,"Overall, this medicine got me out of the hospital in one day with a large clot in my calf.  Much better than the IV drip option.  Shots in stomach aren't too bad if you go slow...let the medicine work its way in slowly.  I did experience small bruising at each shot location, and significant abdominal muscle pain.  The muscle pain was a unique side effect from all the sites I searched, but I was very careful not to inject into a muscle.",Anonymous
