This medication works very well , for my situation ( I am a renal transplant recipient ). Apparently this medication is also responsible for lowering my blood sugar levels, also.",Carol
1,Eliquis,Deep Vein Thrombosis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 2, 2021",0,"For me, eating snow peas, string beans and salads...NO NO on Eliquis. Every body is different. What works on one not necessarily works for another. I had more leg pain. In fact, more difficult to walk. Stopped eating the green stuff and in a few days, was able to walk better. Tried eating green vegetables again, pain returned.Stopped eating the green vegetables, able to walk better.Just my experience with Eliquis and green vegetables.",Eliquis user

Exercise daily, take 5 mg x 2.The only side effects I have is some minor itching, and fatigue. Been on ELIQUIS for over 10 years. It does well for me.

3,Eliquis,Deep Vein Thrombosis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 27, 2021",4,"Absolutely despise this expensive drug with so many side effects.  I experienced frequent urination (almost hourly at night) itchy red rashes forearm and upper arm, gas, easy bruising, onset of a mild headache for someone like me who NEVER got headaches.  I was prescribed it for a lower leg DVT, initially 2- 5MG tablets twice a day for a week, then 1- 5 MG tablet twice a day.After 6 weeks I began a gradual tapering off (AMA of course, against medical advice)  My plan of action was to increase my daily water intake by 400% (used to just drink maybe 8 ounces, plus tea, juice, fruits and veggies (which do count for water intake) reduce oily fatty processed foods, and add additional speed walks throughout the day and early eve as my exercise regimen. I believe these changes will prevent any new blood clots.  All side effects went away within 36 hours of stopping the medication.",BG
4,Eliquis,Deep Vein Thrombosis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2021",1,My son was put on Eliquis one week ago for a DVT in his leg. He is asplenic 6 years ago. He got babesiosis microti from a tick bite. He was diagnosed on June 30th 2021.  His DVT was ascertained on July 16 after his Second hospitalization. He was admitted on July 21st for chest pain when breathing. It was not cardiac related through the whole hospitalization process. It was clearly pain on taking breath’s which required him to do shallow breathing. His pain was in his chest that went to left shoulder. Eliquis was started on 7/16/2021 and his symptoms started on the evening of July 20th. He is 30 years old this past May 2021. Just curious if the Eliquis is responsible or an additional factor that caused this to happen. I am acutely aware that the babesiosis microti  is a extremely life-threatening illness for somebody who is without a spleen.,Mom
5,Eliquis,Deep Vein Thrombosis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 7, 2021",4,Had blood clots develop in leg while traveling once and while flying once. The Eliquis helped to save me several times. Back in the Ole days would've been hospitalized and who knows what could've happen if the clot broke free. I'm reading on here there is a lot of side effects. So I'm not sure if I will take this any longer since reading all of the side effects on this message forum...,Bigman

I discovered after 3 weeks of mild pain and difficulties to bend the knee, and increasing swelling in the left leg. After 8 months doctors reduce the amount at half (2,5mg every 12 hr)Apixaban works as a miracle with me.

10,Eliquis,Deep Vein Thrombosis,2.0,,"June 2, 2020",84,"I was prescribed Eliquis after experiencing an upper extremity deep vein thrombosis due to thoracic outlet syndrome.  The clot was dissolved in hospital through thrombolysis.  I was sent home with Eliquis 10 mgs. x2 per day for a week, then 5 mgs x2 per day for maintenance.  I didn't realize how horrible this drug made me feel until I called my hematologist after 3 months and begged him to reduce the dose.  I experienced extreme fatigue, depression/apathy, muscle pain all over my body, and joint pain that would keep me up at night in my hips and lower back.  My whole body began to hurt all the time after about 5 weeks on the medication.  I couldn't do any exercise without being unable to get out of a chair for days afterwards.  Not to mention the horrible heartburn.  Fortunately, I see a TOS expert soon, and fingers crossed will be able to drop the Eliquis entirely.  Has been an awful experience.",Phoebe

12,Eliquis,Deep Vein Thrombosis,2.0,,"March 13, 2020",49,"Update from a previous comment.Switched from Xeralto to Eliquis about 12 months ago.Horrific side effects as with Xeralto. I had days where I can't remember simple basic things, difficulty remembering family members, names.Am dizzy, nauseous, osteoarthritis, joint pain, ears ringing, complete loss of vision.  Penile bleeding. Strange pimples. Horrific lack of energy. Chest pains and fluttering heart, feels like a heart attack. WEIGHT GAIN... I went from 150-165 average to becoming a 210.

She had the hospital take an ultrasound and they admitted me to the hospital immediately.  Said I had a DVT.  On heparin while in the hospital, no side effects to mention.

16,Eliquis,Deep Vein Thrombosis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 16, 2020",33,"I had a blood clot in abdominal superior mesenteric artery. I was prescribed Eliquis following open surgery to bypass thrombosed SMA artery in the abdomen. Side effects for me are predominantly GI related: severe abdominal/intestinal cramping/pain within 20-40 min after taking it & which lasts a couple hours. It has been confirmed I am now getting adequate blood to my GI system since surgery, so that is not the problem. Bloating and gas are also a problem since taking Eliquis for 2 1/2 months.Hoping my cardiologist will agree to switch me to a different option, even if it means INR blood tests. I had lots of GI issues  prior to surgery that affected my quality of life. Albeit the GI issues I now have are different than pre-bypass, Eliquis is a key factor in my continued reduced quality of life.",Bowritet

However my leg pain and swelling are still present and I've had a headache the entire time. I also just feel like my body hurts and my mouth hurts quite noticeably gums swollen, but its kept me from dying due to pulmonary embolism but I do not like this medicine would rather be on warfarin or heparin because I have taken them before and didn't experience these side affects",Rainikorns
19,Eliquis,Deep Vein Thrombosis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 6, 2019",118,"I was put on Eliquis by my MD just because he liked it better than Warfarin. Was previously on Warfarin with no problems. On Eliquis I have experienced severe muscle spasms and weakness. Also very tired, eyes are blurry, nose bleeds, weight gain, itching, and just general malaise. I asked my Dr several times to take me off Eliquis and put me back on Warfarin. He refused. I changed Dr's, got off the Eliquis back and Warfarin. I now feel soooooo much better and muscles are getting stronger and I have my energy back. This Eliquis is poison to me. I also will note I had no A-Fib. Never did....Listen to your body. It knows best.",Kass

23,Eliquis,Deep Vein Thrombosis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 16, 2018",37,"Following knee surgery I developed a blood clot.  The doctor originally put me on Xarelto and that was a disaster Dr had to take me off of it after 3 weeks and we switched to Eliquis.  Almost immediately after beginning to take Eliquis I start to have random itching sensations all over by body.  At first I didn’t think anything of it, but after 4 weeks on it I started to have uncontrollable itching late at night and extreme swelling in hands and feet due to the scratching.  I would also develop hives and what looked like diaper rash all over my body.  Luckily between the two drugs the clot is gone and I am back on aspirin.  I have only been off of Eliquis for 5 days and some of the rash and itching has gotten better but not yet gone.   I think some of the interactions seemed to be related to what I would eat.",Archie
