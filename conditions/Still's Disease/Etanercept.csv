0,Etanercept,Still's Disease,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 27, 2018",1,"Prescribed Enbrel after 6 months of Methotrexate & Prednisone. My WBC and inflammation was elevated prior to Enbrel. After only 2 weeks, my WBC has returned to normal range. Inflammation has been reduced. Gradually tapering Prednisone after successful Enbrel results. Once a week Sure Click injection is harmless. Don’t freak at YouTube videos that make it seem dreadful. It’s very simple to use. Remove from refrigerator 20-30 minutes before use.",Nicky Nick
