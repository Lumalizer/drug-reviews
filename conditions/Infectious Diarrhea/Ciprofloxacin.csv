0,Ciprofloxacin,Infectious Diarrhea,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 14, 2020",5,I was prescribed ciprofloxacin and was scared to death based on the reviews.  I even contemplated not taking it but nothing else was working so I really had no choice.  ciprofloxacin worked great and I had no side effects at all!  I would recommend cipro; it did it’s job and I’m finally back to normal.,Brookie
1,Ciprofloxacin,Infectious Diarrhea,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 25, 2018",5,"This drug made me feel so much sicker and I'll never take it again. I was prescribed Cipro for a possible stomach infection at 1000mg a day for 7 days. I immediately started experiencing body aches, brain fog, and loss of appetite. On day 4 my ankles and other joints started aching, popping, & swelling. After that I called my doctor &  stopped taking the drug. Its been a few days now and I can say I feel 110x better than I felt when I was on it. I finally have my appetite back & my joints don't swell & ache all day...",ashh
2,Ciprofloxacin,Infectious Diarrhea,,,"February 10, 2017",3,"If you get watery diarrhea while taking this medication, see your doctor immediately. I tend to ignore physical problems, so I don't know how long I had C diff before it was diagnosed.I do know it took well over a year to beat C diff and I don't want anyone to go through that.C diff is not caused by any antibiotic, but some antibiotics help it get serious. (I probably was exposed in a hospital.) It doesn't always respond to treatment.After several hospitalizations for dehydration and hypokalemia, I was put on several IV antibiotics. I don't like to take antibiotics, and I really didn't like IV antibiotics.If your doctor says you have C diff, ask all the questions that come to mind. Follow your doctor's instructions exactly.",Ciara16
