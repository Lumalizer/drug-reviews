0,Xeomin,Facial Wrinkles,2,,"August 10, 2020",2,Was so disappointed in this product Xeomin. It was offered as a lower cost Botox or Dysport alternative. I have had great success with both but frankly with this economy I thought I would try Xeomin . Saw small change for about two weeks and then seem to completely dissipate. I was shocked and feel like I threw away$450 ! Ouch! I reported back to aesthetician but have not heard back.,Robin
