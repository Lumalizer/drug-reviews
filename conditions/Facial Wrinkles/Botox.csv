0,Botox,Facial Wrinkles,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 17, 2017",9,"This neurotoxin sent me to the hospital with leg convulsions, extreme anxiety, confusion, pain, depression and difficulties swallowing. I'm 8 weeks post botox and still have to take meds to stop my legs from convulsing. My anxiety is still through the roof. It's a very scary thing to be told by medical professionals that there is NOTHING they can do to help you. The only advise I was given was to call 911 if my throats started to close and I'd be put on a ventilator. Everyday I'm one day closer to hopefully making a full recovery. But please if you are considering using Botox do your due diligence and be informed on the risks. I had had it many times before with no problems this time my body decided enough was enough!",S.
