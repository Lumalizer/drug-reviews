0,Tamiflu,Avian Influenza,1,,"February 27, 2020",6,"Had sore throat 7P by 7A, was congested achy & coughing. 2 days later went to stat care , diagnosed with flu A, for which prescribed Tamiflu. Also at this time I was taking prednisone & duoneb. I continued to feel worse not better: extreme back & leg pain & headache. The headache was so bad it hurt to stand up or bend down . I felt like I had ringing in my ears and pain in my jaw. I had insomnia ,weird dreams /thoughts slight confusion.  I almost felt like I was losing my mind at times. Freaking out because I am having to miss more work because I’m not getting any better , when I come to find out after doing my research that the Tamiflu is making me sicker. There are a lot of side effects. Like other people I assumed that if I took it as prescribed that in 1-3 days I would start feeling better. That was not true at all. Each day I felt worse and worse and worse , I’m starting to think if there was something wrong with my brain my mental functioning!! I did not take last dose !",Mischa
1,Tamiflu,Avian Influenza,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 15, 2020",3,"My partner was diagnosed with type A flu Monday night. Doc told me if I start experiencing any symptoms to call right away for tamiflu. Tuesday morning I woke up with low grade fever and chest congestion. Started tamiflu Tuesday night. Wednesday chills, body aches temp of 102.5, Thursday fever was gone only chest congestion, Friday still no fever and improving congestion. I’m taking two pills a day 75mg each, for 5 days. No nausea only side effect is I’m a little dizzy from time to time. Best medicine I’ve ever taken to help with the flu!",SF
2,Tamiflu,Avian Influenza,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 21, 2019",7,"Okay so if you have proper flu then there is nothing on earth that can make you feel worse. Truly. If you think you have mild flu and take Tamiflu then, yes, you may end up feeling worse. After having a consistent temp of 40/104 for several days, was prescribed Tamiflu. Within an hour I got stomach pains.  Overnight I had some small nosebleeds. However, after the second dose, my flu symptoms (cough and temperature) had subsided enough that I could actually get out of bed for the first time in three days.  I can only assume that people didn’t have full flu and  didn't feel like they were actually going to pass away,  if they felt worse on Tamiflu.  Just the relief of a few of the flu symptoms is worth the side effects.  Thank god for the NHS prescribing this to me.",SWK
3,Tamiflu,Avian Influenza,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 18, 2019",5,"I had a sudden and rapid onset of flu symptoms, felt like heck. I had the flu shot so was surprised to find out after nasal swabbing that I had the Flu type A. I started Tamiflu the evening of my diagnosis. I prepared myself for stomach distress but I experienced no GI upset at all. By morning I feel so much better. Now 2 days on the med. I feel almost back to normal. So for me this really worked. Impressively so. But after reading others comments, I guess this drug is hit or miss. All I can say is I am very glad I tried it and it worked for me. Just keep in mind people are more likely to comment when having a bad experience, so the comments are going to be skewed to the negative.",Linda
4,Tamiflu,Avian Influenza,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 12, 2019",6,"Severe flu, tested positive for Avian. On initial dose I believe it gave some body ache relief. After that the nausea was so bad just forced myself to eat to have something in my tummy.  By 3rd day I was nauseated and vomiting so stopped entirely. For me, the cure was as bad as the flu issues themselves. For most others it was fine. After reading tamiflu will only shorten duration by a day, I don’t see why this is even prescribed-with or without the side effects-as I still continued to take OTC meds  for horrid cough, fever and severe headache.",Parle
5,Tamiflu,Avian Influenza,2,,"January 31, 2018",3,"Was sick for 1 week, went to Dr she gave Tamiflu. I have Mastocytosis so I'm up compromised. Bad sinus nothing given for sinus. 101-102 fever, vomiting, diarrhea, swollen neck gland, feel bad all over, weak. Tamiflu helped until I finished 5 days then it came back with a vengeance sicker now than I was before. Called dr., she said not giving anything. Guess it's the ER if I feel any worse, it's hard to breath already.",Laura Z
6,Tamiflu,Avian Influenza,9,,"March 4, 2013",16,"My Granddaughter all of a sudden came down with a high fever of 105 degrees. We took her to urgent care her flu test came up positive for Type A. The doctor gave her Tamiflu and within 1 day her fever was completely gone. Within two days she was 60% better. Unfortunately I became ill and sure enough tested positive for Type A flu. I was given Tamiflu and I have never experienced such quick results. I was very ill with fever, chills, fatigue, body aches, terrible congestion, and coughing. After 1 day on Tamiflu, my symptoms lessened. I was 50% better within 24 hours and 70% better within 48 hours. The only downside was I lost some hearing in my left ear & have 2 severely infected ears. Dr. said side effect of Tamiflu is ear infections.",cheryl I
