0,Voriconazole,Systemic Fungal Infection,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 19, 2019",2,Vfend (voriconazole):I have been prescribed this medicine for three months now.  it is the only thing to really slow down my systemic Candidiasis. The hand rashes and tissue in the urine and fatigue is better on this medicine however it just will not kick it out of my heart and my brain for good. I do see the yellow and green tint colors when I get a good batch of it (I recommend paying more for Pfizer) but it is worth it for the benefits. These vision changes and the ward off of the fungus wear off after a couple hours.  Of all the azoles I have tried this has been the best one.   Watch your heart liver kidney and eyes,Lguthr
