0,Itraconazole,Systemic Fungal Infection,1,,"December 20, 2020",1,"I do have to say this is a VERY potent anti fungal. I usually use diflucan with minimal side effects. My first derm put me on this for Malassezia Folliculitis it was supposed to be 30 days and I barely made it to 15. First it made my cycle start 17 days early. I thought that would be my cycle for the month, but nope, it still came when it was supposed to. I had horrible nightmares and barely slept. Woke up jittery every morning and just felt like I wanted to sleep all day long because I lacked sleep from the night before. I didn't really have much of an appetite and would just make myself eat because I knew I needed to. I had the worst headaches, blurred vision, and would occasionally feel dizzy. It did calm the horrible symptoms I was having, but my 2nd derm took me off of them because he felt the dose of 200 mg a day for 30 days was really bad on my liver. I feel it's totally worth the side effects if you want quick relief. But honestly be prepared for some tear jerky anxious days",Cakegirl
1,Itraconazole,Systemic Fungal Infection,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 18, 2020",7,Sporanox (itraconazole):I've taken Sporanox twice in the last 20 years. Both times it was very effective. Both times I took it to clear up toenail fungus. The first time it had the added benefit of clearing up my Iritis. I had a persistent Iritis inflammation problem before using Sporonox and have not had a single case since. The second time it effected my heart in a seriously detrimental way. I was driving and had to pull off the road and pass out. I recovered completely but will never take this particular medication again. This drug is not to be used by patients with ANY history of heart disease.,Randall
