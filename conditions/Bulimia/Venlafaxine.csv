0,Venlafaxine,Bulimia,10.0,,"June 12, 2016",9,"I had been taking Venlafaxine for over 3 years for bulimia and severe depression. For two of those years I took 300mg a day (4 x 75mg tablets), two in the morning and two in the evening.Just 2 months ago I decided to stop taking this drug as everything in my life felt fake and I felt numb to all emotion. I tapered my withdrawal from this drug and just over 2 months in, I seriously angry and crying all the time.  The initial withdrawal (first  few weeks) was horrendous, but now 2 months in and I think this stage is just awful.  Loved ones and friend don't want to be around me as I get angry at the slightest thing.I just pray I get through this, but it is so hard and I feel for everyone else out there in the same boat as me.",Shoeswho
1,Venlafaxine,Bulimia,,,"October 18, 2013",11,"Thanks to Venlafaxine my depression got better and I'm less stressed out about food, portion control and eating with others in general. Also my suicidal thoughts have 'disappeared' so far. However my desire to purge has not stopped. I'm still suffering from bulimia with anorexic tendencies.  I also experienced side effects such as dizziness and a lack of emotion.",tooyoungtodiet
