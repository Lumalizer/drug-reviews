1,Fluoxetine,Bulimia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 13, 2021",9,"Prozac (fluoxetine):I’ve been struggling with bulimia for the last 6 years and after being hospitalized for I decided I was done with my life being consumed by food. I started on 10mg of Prozac about two weeks ago and my dose has been upped to 20mg. I’ve relapsed only once and even then I was able to stop myself from continuing as I would throughout a usual relapse day. I can finally listen to music again, hangout  with my friends, eat meals, I feel like I have my life back, I feel like myself again. It is a little early to tell 100% if this med has worked for me but so far I’m amazed with how much it’s done. I do still have a little bit of anxiety  here and there but my doctor said to give it a couple more weeks. So far I’m really happy with my experience with Prozac!",Baby12344
2,Fluoxetine,Bulimia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 12, 2020",13,"3/3... so I went back down to 40mg. This seemed to be the best dose for me with hindsight. I tried going back down to 20mg but within two weeks I was making myself sick on a daily basis again. In the end I decided to stop the 40mg cold turkey due to an unrelated health situation. This was two weeks ago, and although I am feeling a bit blue today (the two week thing), it has actually been pretty easy so far. I had always been fairly anti medication, but if your are like me and bulimia was controlling your life, I can highly recommend it. Trust that the initial side affects pass. It made me feel less guilty too - there clearly was something not quite right with my brain chemistry following various traumatic experiences, and fluoxetine helped to set me on the right track. Good luck to everyone also struggling with bulimia - I know it will always be a part of my life, but we can beat it, and if in the future I need to come back to fluoxetine for a bit of help again than do be it.",Z
3,Fluoxetine,Bulimia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 12, 2020",5,"Having suffered from bulimia in secret for 5 year I finally decided to get help. I admitted to anxiety to my doctor but didn’t reveal the bulimia. As expected I scored highly on the anxiety scale, but my depression score was ok. He put me onto sertraline and my goodness- it was the worst couple of days ever -  literally felt so awful - sick, shaking. I stopped immediately and decided medication was not for me.A couple of months later I was honest with my doctor and had done a bit more research. Thank goodness I had - he suggested few other antidepressants, but didn’t seem to be aware of the success of fluoxetine in treating bulimia. He looked it up in front of me at my suggestion, and I began with fluoxetine. ...",Z

After upping the dosage to 40mg I have not relapsed for 3 months and 16 days. This is after a devastating secret battle with bulimia of seven years. I have now upped the dosage to 60mg to manage a hair pulling disorder but my obsession around foods and eating beyond my needs are truly a thing of the past. I am so grateful for this drug. Please combine with an app that will track your relapse dates for awareness but also celebrate as you hit weekly, monthly and hopefully yearly ‘milestones’.

7,Fluoxetine,Bulimia,3.0,,"October 30, 2019",9,"Prozac (fluoxetine):After more than two months, I stopped taking Prozac. Here are the pros and cons of this med (in my own experience): Pros: 1. My mood is always better than usual 2. I no longer have death wishes3. The bingeing urges noticeably lowered down but never stopped completely Cons:1. NIGHTMARES, extremely terrible ones. They  were just getting worse and worse 2. Anxiety and yes it’s bad but not too much in my case 3. Tiring day all day. I would feel that I’m tired, so sleepy, and dizzy all day.4. Stuffy nose that I would always feel that I’m sick or having a fluAfter I stopped the med:1. I feel much energized and awake, less dizzy, yet it didn’t affect my sleep2. I dream normally and not too heavily 3. No more stuffy/runny sinus4. However, I know my mood will lower down a bit, but I need to compromise because I just can’t stand the side effects, and the med in specific after two months couldn’t prove that it can ‘stop’ the bingeing urges I get.",Linda
8,Fluoxetine,Bulimia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 18, 2019",37,Prozac (fluoxetine):On 40mg and took a while to work for my bulimia. Eating disorders are usually a higher dose of prozac.

10,Fluoxetine,Bulimia,10.0,,"July 8, 2019",124,"Prozac (fluoxetine):Before I started taking this drug I gave myself anxiety reading bad reviews. I never really allowed myself to believe I was depressed because there were always people who had it worse. I never allowed myself to believe that my seven years of bulimia and anorexia were a problem. When I became depressed again this year, after years of fighting I decided to take the plunge. I was prescribed 20mg and went up to 60mg in three months and have stayed here for the last four months. It was within two months that my friends noticed a difference in my personality. I was happy. I laughed. I felt confident in myself for the first time in a decade. I am lighter. Prozac, for me, has saved my life. Yes, I also eat healthier and go to therapy and try to meditate - but without this medication I don’t know where or who I would be. I lost myself for many years and I found myself again thanks to this medication. If your doctor has prescribed it, trust that advice and trust this review.",Karni

Side effects subsided and I still work a program of recovery every day... I highly recommend therapy and healthy living practices in conjunction with this medication, it can work!",Layla

So I started on 20mg prozac, which did nothing and have upped it to 80mg which seems like the 'sweet spot' for me- no self-harm thoughts, no bingeing or purging-it has literally saved my life. This is the dose that is required for eating disorders or OCD, the lower doses are antidepressant dose!

15,Fluoxetine,Bulimia,6.0,,"September 7, 2017",20,"Prozac (fluoxetine):I'd struggled with bulimia and depression  for many years, I was prescribed Prozac to mainly treat my depression, and partly the eating disorder. With my personal experience with bulimia I never had the urges to binge eat, just to make myself vomit after eating proper sized portions of food. I had found that the Prozac had helped stopped the urges to throw up after eating quite effectively. The only side effect being that once I had stopped taking it the urges returned immediately. Currently and trying to battle those thoughts without being prescribed medication, but may go back onto it if I'm unsuccessful after a year, or so.",Mich2900

I was beyond impressed. I stopped taking it after about a year and a half out of recovery and immediately started noticing I had serious anxiety issues and the depression came back. After about 6 months of being off of prozac, I recently was put back on it at my regular 60mg and it still works. While I don't suffer from bulimia anymore (or have controlled those symptoms), prozac has provided the stability I was begging my brain for.

I also experienced a noticeable increase in binging/purging during this time in an attempt to deal with the dysphoria and insomnia. I've only been on the medication 3 days, but oh my god. I'm not thinking about food all day long. My cravings are gone, my appetite is ""normal"". I don't feel like I'm constantly fighting that irresistible urge to binge. I have been getting tired during the day and will probably switch to taking it at night. Also have zero libido, which I like because its easier to focus.

My quality of life has improved immensely and for the first time in years I am not thinking about food and weight constantly. One side effect I do experience is tiredness, which I find frustrating, but whenever I try to reduce my medication intake I start binging and purging again. Out of the 10-15 antidepressants I have tried over the years this has been the only one to assist without dreadful side effects (e.g. Topiamate). I wish everyone luck with their personal battle and know how challenging and isolating this condition can be.

Since I was 18 I used to gain weight and was trying to drop it sometimes with laxatives, sometimes with really awful diets that made me binge overeating all the time. I went to gym, working hard but then coming home and eat everything that I could find, even food that I dont really like, I was crying telling myself that tomorrow I'll change my live. It has been like that FOR YEARS. I hated myself, lost all my friends, never could build a relationship with men who loved me (I didn't believe that somebody can love me). Now (on 20 mg Prozac) I am happy, drop all the weight that I gained, I love a man who loves me and really enjoy my life. Give it a chance!XOXO",Emi90

I started at 20 mg, went up to 40 mg, then went back down to 20 as I was running low on meds. I had some weird side effects, such as feeling very anxious and having self-harm thoughts (although not suicidal thoughts).I went to the doctor and my dose was adjusted up to 60 mg.

It truly allows you to lead a normal life again without your day being consumed by thoughts of food and binging/purging. I have always been my physically healthiest when I was taking my 40 mg daily. I would, however, wean myself off eventually due to the sexual dysfunction and a lack of feeling emotions, as well as feeling like I had beaten the bulima - only to have it return full-fledged within 1 1/2 - 2 months. That is the case now, so I'm going back on it. It is still important to get cognitive therapy, so that you may control it on your own if Prozac's effects eventually wear off for you.

How I look at it is I was much to depressed, hating myself, and bloated from bulimia to want to have sex anyway! At least now I feel much better in my own skin, and I'm so rarely bloated, when before I couldn't remember the last time I wasn't bloated. I was insecure in EVERY situation and in all clothing.
