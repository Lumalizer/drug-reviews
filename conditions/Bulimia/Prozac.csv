0,Prozac,Bulimia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 13, 2021",9,"I’ve been struggling with bulimia for the last 6 years and after being hospitalized for I decided I was done with my life being consumed by food. I started on 10mg of Prozac about two weeks ago and my dose has been upped to 20mg. I’ve relapsed only once and even then I was able to stop myself from continuing as I would throughout a usual relapse day. I can finally listen to music again, hangout  with my friends, eat meals, I feel like I have my life back, I feel like myself again. It is a little early to tell 100% if this med has worked for me but so far I’m amazed with how much it’s done. I do still have a little bit of anxiety  here and there but my doctor said to give it a couple more weeks. So far I’m really happy with my experience with Prozac!",Baby12344
1,Prozac,Bulimia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 16, 2020",138,"This drug saved my life. 5 months ago I started on 20mg of Prozac, this helped manage the binge cravings but I relapsed a few times throughout that period. After upping the dosage to 40mg I have not relapsed for 3 months and 16 days. This is after a devastating secret battle with bulimia of seven years. I have now upped the dosage to 60mg to manage a hair pulling disorder but my obsession around foods and eating beyond my needs are truly a thing of the past. I am so grateful for this drug. Please combine with an app that will track your relapse dates for awareness but also celebrate as you hit weekly, monthly and hopefully yearly ‘milestones’. Sending everybody love who needs it.",Proprozac
2,Prozac,Bulimia,3.0,,"October 30, 2019",9,"After more than two months, I stopped taking Prozac. Here are the pros and cons of this med (in my own experience): Pros: 1. My mood is always better than usual 2. I no longer have death wishes3. The bingeing urges noticeably lowered down but never stopped completely Cons:1. NIGHTMARES, extremely terrible ones. They  were just getting worse and worse 2. Anxiety and yes it’s bad but not too much in my case 3. Tiring day all day. I would feel that I’m tired, so sleepy, and dizzy all day.4. Stuffy nose that I would always feel that I’m sick or having a fluAfter I stopped the med:1. I feel much energized and awake, less dizzy, yet it didn’t affect my sleep2. I dream normally and not too heavily 3. No more stuffy/runny sinus4. However, I know my mood will lower down a bit, but I need to compromise because I just can’t stand the side effects, and the med in specific after two months couldn’t prove that it can ‘stop’ the bingeing urges I get.",Linda
3,Prozac,Bulimia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 18, 2019",37,On 40mg and took a while to work for my bulimia. Eating disorders are usually a higher dose of prozac. It’s working now and had night sweats for a little but now it’s gone. My eating disorder (ED) thoughts are turned down and I’m not spending 24/7 thinking about food,Mimi
4,Prozac,Bulimia,10.0,,"July 8, 2019",124,"Before I started taking this drug I gave myself anxiety reading bad reviews. I never really allowed myself to believe I was depressed because there were always people who had it worse. I never allowed myself to believe that my seven years of bulimia and anorexia were a problem. When I became depressed again this year, after years of fighting I decided to take the plunge. I was prescribed 20mg and went up to 60mg in three months and have stayed here for the last four months. It was within two months that my friends noticed a difference in my personality. I was happy. I laughed. I felt confident in myself for the first time in a decade. I am lighter. Prozac, for me, has saved my life. Yes, I also eat healthier and go to therapy and try to meditate - but without this medication I don’t know where or who I would be. I lost myself for many years and I found myself again thanks to this medication. If your doctor has prescribed it, trust that advice and trust this review.",Karni
5,Prozac,Bulimia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 7, 2019",35,"I was very hesitant to start on this medication as I have been really active in a recovery program and do what I can to alleviate depression and anxiety through practicing mindfulness and reaching out for help within my social network.. but I also suffer from a severe case of bulimia which has persisted for over a decade...First couple days side effects were a little intense, no appetite and trouble sleeping for a night or two.. but I have to say that this medication is truly helpful for my obsessive preoccupations with weight and food, as well as social anxiety (definitely see why people who have general anxiety would NOT do well on this need, it makes me a bit more uppity) and mood stability. Side effects subsided and I still work a program of recovery every day... I highly recommend therapy and healthy living practices in conjunction with this medication, it can work!",Layla
6,Prozac,Bulimia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 4, 2018",54,"I've had bulimia for at least 10 years; I'm 53 and don't want to be doing this when I'm 70! So I started on 20mg prozac, which did nothing and have upped it to 80mg which seems like the 'sweet spot' for me- no self-harm thoughts, no bingeing or purging-it has literally saved my life. This is the dose that is required for eating disorders or OCD, the lower doses are antidepressant dose! Such a relief not to be thinking about food 24/7!If you want to get better, this is the way to go.",jadesgreen
7,Prozac,Bulimia,6.0,,"September 7, 2017",20,"I'd struggled with bulimia and depression  for many years, I was prescribed Prozac to mainly treat my depression, and partly the eating disorder. With my personal experience with bulimia I never had the urges to binge eat, just to make myself vomit after eating proper sized portions of food. I had found that the Prozac had helped stopped the urges to throw up after eating quite effectively. The only side effect being that once I had stopped taking it the urges returned immediately. Currently and trying to battle those thoughts without being prescribed medication, but may go back onto it if I'm unsuccessful after a year, or so.",Mich2900
8,Prozac,Bulimia,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 19, 2017",44,"I had started prozac while I was in my recovery for bulimia and it worked incredibly to stop my binges and regulate my eating. I was beyond impressed. I stopped taking it after about a year and a half out of recovery and immediately started noticing I had serious anxiety issues and the depression came back. After about 6 months of being off of prozac, I recently was put back on it at my regular 60mg and it still works. While I don't suffer from bulimia anymore (or have controlled those symptoms), prozac has provided the stability I was begging my brain for. If you're someone who gets depressed in the winter months, has problems concentrating, and has tremors from anxiety - take this!",veggiebowl
9,Prozac,Bulimia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 23, 2017",9,Has not worked for my belumia. I still throw up almost every meal. I don't throw up after taking it because I know I need it.,deehee
10,Prozac,Bulimia,1.0,,"December 28, 2016",18,"I've had bulimia for 8 years and I was on Prozac for 3 months, nothing changed. We kept upping it every month,. Maybe I needed a much higher dose? Idk desperate but hopeless right now.",IamNova
11,Prozac,Bulimia,10.0,,"April 6, 2016",60,I been taking Prozac for 3 monthes I don't binge or purge anymore I only throw up when I'm sick . I was thinking about suicide but now I'm 3 month purge free. I'm confident that if I stay on it I can live the rest of my life bulimia free. Bulimia is a ghost of my past now . Peace Michael ,Geojhkj
12,Prozac,Bulimia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 23, 2015",76,"I used to constantly think about food.. My thoughts would be racing whether to stuff my face or not eat at all. When I started 40 mg Prozac, it took a while and until I realized I didn't think about it anymore! Very glad my mind is off food for once!",Pillz_
13,Prozac,Bulimia,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 2, 2015",20,"I have been taking Prozac for anorexia nervosa. I started ever since I was 11. It has helped me with gaining weight. It sucks though cause I was at a normal weight. I have noticed a slight change in my mood.I used to be constantly screaming at myself, telling myself I can't have the foods I want. That voice is kinda gone although it is startING to come back....I have done all I could so that's why my doctor put me on this med.....I am taking 10mg now...They might be upping my dose soon though.",UnKnOwN.900
14,Prozac,Bulimia,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 13, 2015",67,Prozac saved my life!!! I struggled with bulimia for years and now I can finally say I rarely even think of binging n purging! It is the ultimate freedom....I can honestly say if it wasn't for this medication I would have died. I have so much faith in this medication!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,C girl
15,Prozac,Bulimia,9.0,,"April 7, 2015",33,Prozac has been great! I was so worried to start taking it that I read a million reviews and almost didn't take it but I'm so glad I did. It has been a life saver!,misspippainpink
16,Prozac,Bulimia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 12, 2014",169,"I would not be alive today if not for Prozac.  I was throwing up 5 times a day and so desperately unhappy I often thought of suicide.  I escaped an abusive childhood only to move on to the living hell that is bulimia.  Within two weeks of Prozac my all consuming thoughts about food, weight & throwing up diminished and I started focusing on my future, college and doing something other than throwing up all day. I weaned myself off of it after about 2 years of being bulimia free. I was bulimic for 13 years and haven't thrown up now in 15 years (except for the flu). Please try it for bulimia, no negative side effects that I remember.",prozac saved my life
17,Prozac,Bulimia,10.0,,"July 22, 2014",68,"I've struggled with bulimia (as well as depression/mood disorder) for about eight years now. I've been on Prozac three separate times (I quit taking it during my pregnancies) and I stop binging and purging every time I get back on it. It has also benefited my relationships and improved my parenting abilities. Every other medication I tried was just too hard on me, but Prozac doesn't affect me in any noticeably negative way.",SarahSwar
18,Prozac,Bulimia,10.0,,"June 10, 2014",55,I had an eating disorder for almost a decade and Prozac really stopped the thoughts and behaviors,Decadelost
19,Prozac,Bulimia,10.0,,"October 16, 2013",109,"I have suffered Bulimia for about 10 years and at different stages was binging/purging up to 5 times a day. Over the years I have tried so many medications, but Prozac is the first to really assist. I started on 20mg, which has recently increased to 40mg. This is the only medicine/therapy that has dramatically decreased my impulse to binge/purge. I am feeling so happy within myself and it has really assisted with my depression and low energy levels too. One odd side effect I have noted is that I am yawning a lot, a small price to pay to being in control of my eating and mood. This is definitely worth a try if you are having bulimic symptoms and recommend it highly. Good luck.",Oddmolly
20,Prozac,Bulimia,8.0,,"May 18, 2013",128,"So I've been on 20mg Fluoxetine for three Weeks, and I never thought I'd ever go a day without binging again/purging. I feel happier, my relationship is so much better. I can go to family BBQs and focus on them and not the plentiful food. Some cons are: delayed or nonexistent orgasm, low libido, yawning. How I look at it is I was much to depressed, hating myself, and bloated from bulimia to want to have sex anyway! At least now I feel much better in my own skin, and I'm so rarely bloated, when before I couldn't remember the last time I wasn't bloated. I was insecure in EVERY situation and in all clothing. I suffered for a long time,and to see how much relief I've gotten from just 20Mg of this tiny pill is a miracle.",junko
21,Prozac,Bulimia,9.0,,"August 2, 2012",97,Start taking for depression a couple of weeks ago. Side effect is I have not had any compulsion to binge or purge for the last week. Amazing after 18 years of bulimia.,Sky girl

24,Prozac,Bulimia,10.0,,"August 15, 2011",107,"I'm taking 60 mg Prozac since 4 weeks. I only relapsed twice in the first week (while being on a lower dose) It took away the urge to binge and even purge. I'm less depressed, too. I've been through 5 years of psychoanalysis and 2 hospital stays all to no avail (never took medicines). I have bulimia for over 25 years and am hopeful to get rid of the food pressure - for good. Prozaz changed my life so far. I'll update at a later time.",Anonymous

27,Prozac,Bulimia,,,"December 8, 2009",82,"I am 23 years old and have been bulimic since I was 11.  This is the first medication that made a difference. I used to take Prozac for depression, and it helped somewhat. When my eating disorder got way too out of hand, my psychiatrist and I decided to raise my dose to 100 mg (dosage is higher for bulimia than depression).  I still feel obsessive over food and weight, but now when I get the urge to binge I have a chance to fight it.  It seems to have lessened the compulsion or the need to follow through on urges.  It's not a miracle cure, but it has given me a fighting chance.  I was actually able to go through an entire pregnancy without binging or purging once.  I am now in recovery, and my slips are few and far between.",Anonymous
28,Prozac,Bulimia,10.0,,"June 17, 2008",159,"This has made such a difference to my life. It is like the ""voice"" that continues to tell me I am too fat and that all the ""bad"" things in life would be better if only I were thinner, has weakened. It is still there but I don't have to listen, if fact I can even ignore it. What a relief. It has made me realize just how much time I was spending listening to all the negative thoughts, planning the food, covering up the vomiting. I finally feel ""normal"" what a relief.",Anonymous
