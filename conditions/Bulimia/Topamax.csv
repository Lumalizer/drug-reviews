0,Topamax,Bulimia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 4, 2021",12,"I have been bulimic since 20 years plus. Nothing has helped. I have been in and out of recovery, counselling, it has always come back. I was put on 25mg top which did nothing. It was increased to 50mg then 100 mg and then the binging craving just went away. Still it wasnâ€™t magic - it is not a magic drug. While it will take away the cravings, there will be slips like in my case. But from bingeing twice a week to bingeing once in two weeks I have come a long way.  Thank you so much. This is life saving!!",Recoveringbulimic
1,Topamax,Bulimia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 9, 2019",11,It's been 3 weeks since I started taking Topamax 50mg daily.All soda and carbonated drinks taste disgusting. I can no longer taste salt or sugar either???I tried making mashed potato for my family and nearly gave them all strokes due to the heinous amount of salt I added. Yet I could barely taste it.Also. My memory is even worse than it was. I don't even remember 3 days out of this passed week. I blinked. And now it's the weekend. And I've lost 2kg! So far so good.,newmind
2,Topamax,Bulimia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 3, 2019",51,"I am a 47 yr old  LICSW crises clinician and have bulimic since 15, with periods of restricting and over exercise and overeating. I went to therapy and 12 step program anorexics and bulimics anonymous (longest sober time out of 12 years in program was 5 months).  After topomax  things changed and I realized  my obsession with food, purging and running 10-15 miles everyday was in my brain-not in a a higher power. Topomax is  truly amazing and I can't believe no one told me about this until I was almost 46 yrs old.  I lived with eating disorder  for 45 years of my life. My memory  is different. I have to live with it.  People  with medical issues have to deal with lots of medications side effects. I will take it.",lovesdogs
3,Topamax,Bulimia,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 10, 2018",38,"I'm an educated, certified, educator and RN who has dealt with Bulimia since age 12. When I was a teenager I was put on Topamax for two years and then in combination with Prozac for one year for depression and the eating disorder. 100% it worked. I got out of the cycle and didn't gain any unwanted weight, eventually getting off the two and still felt great. It wasn't until after giving birth twice that the depression and bulimia came back. Post baby number two and one lost baby in between, at age 27 I couldn't drop the unwanted weight and felt depressed about it. Now 30 I am considering going back on the meds because it worked so well the first time, but I am the type of person who doesn't like mind altering drugs or the feeling that I can't do it on my own. 3 years deep right now and my doctor really wants me to go back on meds at least to bridge my recovery. To those looking for a medication to assist, I know this one works.",Flawed RN
4,Topamax,Bulimia,1.0,,"October 16, 2017",16,"I lost 10 pounds. I also almost went blind so after a month I quit and my vision returned. I quick cold turkey and had sleep paralysis with hallucinations. It was scary as heck. I was awake paralyzed, couldn't talk could not move. My hallucinations were I was in my room and something picked me up and threw me. Then something touched my back. A evil rabbit whispered in my ear. Then I woke up back on the other side of the room. This drug made me stupid as heck. I couldn't spell, talk or remember anything. My sleep paralysis scared me for life and I still think of the realistic dreams I had for 6 days. Don't take this medicine. It is terrible.",Okaywhocareswhatmyname
5,Topamax,Bulimia,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 16, 2017",17,"Update: this is an update to the previous review, see below. I have been on topiramate and 20 mg prozac since 3 plus years now. I have been tapering on and off all meds and have to say the combo 20 mg prozac with 100 mg topiramate twice daily  does work best. It is not perfect, but I am better. Since I am still quite symptomatic I will have an upcoming visit yet another psychiater who is screening ,me for adult add. There is a possibility that if this is the case a stimulant might actually help me out (after 35 years of treatment refractory anorexia and bulimia nervosa). I keep updated.",Ms treatment resistant
6,Topamax,Bulimia,6.0,,"September 10, 2014",28,"I was on Topamax 2x 50 mg worked perfect for 31 days, then the effect wore off, now I am on day 3, Dr. Increased dosage 100mg 2x per day, works perfect. I am cautious as I have been 6 months relapse free on 60 mg fluoxetine before the effects wore off. Will give an update. I have been on all other kinds of SSRIs or SNRIs, which had no effect. My history, I am 42 years old, I have treatment refractory Bulimia since 28 years, purging type. Start with AN with a simple diet, normal childhood, no trauma or abuse, two lengthy hospital stays in the 80s and 90s   5 years of CGJung psychoanalysis all to 0 avail. Learned a lot but have never been in recovery. I try anything to be better.",Ms treatment resistant
7,Topamax,Bulimia,8.0,,"May 14, 2014",41,"I had been bulimic, anorexic for 15 years. I tried in-patient/ out-patient programs in the best places in  Toronto, Canada .. and I did each 3-4 times. When I started Topamax, I could attend lunches at work and can honestly say I haven't binged at work this year (I am a teacher). In previous years, I binged and purged, 3-4 times a day.I know socialize and have friends.I do admit though that the meds have made me very, very, tired. I sleep in until about 1 or 2 pm on the weekends which brothers me a lot but I think its a small price to pay for the huge changes I've made.",mkelly33
8,Topamax,Bulimia,9.0,,"March 27, 2014",53,"It helps. For me it wasn't so much the appetite suppression that worked, but the way it makes me more conscious of the situation before I binge. Its makes me stop in the middle of the binge or just before completely,  and ask myself whats up with the need to hit the self destruct button. In case that I do binge on Topamax, my binges consists of less food when. And I eat slower, defeated by the situation.",a must have.
9,Topamax,Bulimia,9.0,,"November 26, 2013",37,"I've tried Prozac and Effexor. I'm back on Topamax because it seems to be the only medicine that works for me. I never thought my bulimia would get this far, I'm 22 and I've been bulimic since I was 14. I'm done university, and it's been the hardest thing I've had to go through. I've had trouble finding a job and leading my life in the right direction...I wish this medication was sought out more for bulimia.",kaycp
10,Topamax,Bulimia,8.0,,"June 26, 2010",32,I think this medication is very helpful it prevents the binges which then prevents the other behaviors. Side effects rough at first.,Anonymous
11,Topamax,Bulimia,7.0,,"April 9, 2009",26,"I have been suffering with bulimia for five years. I am 22 years old and a college student and I will take the memory loss, there is always spell check. I cannot describe the pain I go through, the guilt, the shame, and I never ever really thought it would get to this point, five years. I know someone's mom who is dying that has has several organ transplants and has been bulimic for over 30 years. I don't want that to be me. I can't stop. I never wanted it to get this far. With Topamax I am gaining weight. It works, it's like instant gratification.",Anonymous
