0,Doxycycline,Rickettsial Infection,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 26, 2021",0,"Thank God and chemists for Doxycycline! It was cheap, worked well and had no side effects.I was bitten by a tick and 12 days later, woke up seriously sick: terrible headache, high fever, stiffness, etc. 4 days later, a centripetal rash began spreading toward my core. I had taken pictures of the tick and it was tentatively ID'd as Dermacentor variabalis, the 'American Dog Tick.' Diagnosis: Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (Rickettsia rickettsii.) It took a few days before I noticed any improvement, but Doxycycline knocked the infection out. I can't imagine how bad it would've gotten and how long the Rickettsial infection would've lasted without Doxycycline! Later, an entomologist ID'd the tick as Amblyomma macalatum, the 'Gulf Coast Tick.' It is not a known vector of RMSF, so this means I was probably infected with Rickettsia parkeri, which is a member of the 'Spotted Fever Group Rickettsia' very similar in nature to RMSF, but not quite as severe, 'severe' being a relative term!",Verbum_Vincet
1,Doxycycline,Rickettsial Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 14, 2020",4,"I've never written a drug review before. My experience with doxy was horrendous! The first day 2 x 100mg I didn't have any symptoms. 2nd day brought on an intense panic attack and irrational thoughts. My mood was so labile, one minute laughing followed by crying intensely. I'm a sensible person and this just floored me. It's reported that psychiatric effects between 1%-10% of people taking doxy. There are cases where people with no psychiatric history and normally content have had suicidal ideation and completed suicide. My doctor and pharmacist were unaware of this despite ""depression and anxiety"" listed on the consumer information leaflet.",Ness
