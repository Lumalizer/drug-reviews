5,Aleve,Sciatica,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 24, 2016",27,"Save your money. Might as well take a baby aspirin. Extra strength Advil Liquid Gels, or Tylenol Arthritis work 10 times better.",JSF130

7,Aleve,Sciatica,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 8, 2015",16,"Aleve heavily advertised for 12 hour pain relief.  Also recommended by a friend.  Tried as desperate for all day pain relief from sciatic nerve.  No effect whatsoever, persevered for a week, no relief, even with recommended stretching.",Vixmum
8,Aleve,Sciatica,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 30, 2014",161,"Unbelievable!  After suffering everyday with sciatica nerve pain, losing sleep, falling into depression, I tried one pill, Aleve. Nothing else I tried worked.  Aleve did exactly what my body needed to get relief from pain and inflammation.  I didn't want a narcotic, no. I will continue to take Aleve for a week to be sure that all traces of sciatica and inflammation are completely gone.",Maili
9,Aleve,Sciatica,10.0,,"October 7, 2013",129,Unbelievable searing pain down the right side of my right leg always first thing in the morning after getting out of bed. I quickly take two Aleve with a glass of milk and wait for the pain to subside which usually takes about forty five minutes. I am then fine for the rest of the day. I also do yoga exercises later in the day which helps.,Daisy304
10,Aleve,Sciatica,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 2, 2012",198,"When I have sciatica pain in my hip I quickly eat something (protein bar often works), take two Aleve, then lay down on the floor and put my legs up on a chair. Sometimes I put an ice pack on the area also, and I lay there for 10-20 minutes and the pain almost always subsides. Then I make sure to stretch a bit so the pain doesn't return when the Aleve wears off. Aleve works GREAT when I'm in pain, but don't forget how vital it is to stretch and exercise also. ",Leon Saper
11,Aleve,Sciatica,9.0,,"November 18, 2009",105,"A surgeon recommended that I have a procedure to deal with the effects of several ruptured disks in my lower back.  I prefer to put off the surgery for as long as I can, and use Aleve on an almost daily basis.  It works just fine for me, and I only have an incident about every 1.5 years, and usually because I overdo the yard work. When it gets very bad, I supplement with an anti spasmodic drug for a few days.",Lansingite
