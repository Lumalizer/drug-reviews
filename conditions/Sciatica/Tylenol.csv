0,Tylenol,Sciatica,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 16, 2020",6,"Tylenol did zero to help my Sciatic nerve pain, although it's helped in the past with other issues.  -  nothing else prescribed helped either but oddly enough Mocha flavoured monster drink would remove about 80% of the pain for about 5-8 hours. I have no idea why but it's the only relief I get.(except hot showers help too it seems)",Ron
