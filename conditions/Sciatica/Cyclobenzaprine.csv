0,Cyclobenzaprine,Sciatica,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 18, 2021",0,"I take Cyclobenzaprine for herniated discs in my low back, Fibromyalgia and Myofascial Pain. I take 10mg at 6:30pm, and another 10mg at 10:30pm. It's meh. It makes me drowsy enough to fall asleep but I still wake often with pain. I take 600mg Gabapentin twice daily. I take 500mg of Naproxen and one 5/325mg Norco as needed. I was on Soma before the FDA took it off the market and it worked SO much better than Cyclobenzaprine! I took one Soma tablet before bed and it stopped the spasms completely and I slept through the night. I had no w/d when it was discontinued and I'd been on it for 4 years. I wish they'd bring it back, but of course the drug addicts have to ruin everything for people who actually need it. We people with chronic pain need an easy button! Just press it and boom, pain is eradicated! Sending prayers, love and light to all of you, have a wonderful, safe holiday season and happy new year!!",Jedi Master
1,Cyclobenzaprine,Sciatica,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 19, 2021",0,"Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine):I was prescribed this on two separate occasions, one was for TMJ issues 4 years ago. I heard really great things about this medication, including complete relief from pain and the ability to have a good night's rest. I took 10mg every night for a 30 days and didn't notice a difference in pain nor was there an improvement in my sleep. It did absolutely nothing. I could barely open my mouth enough to take a bite of food or to yawn. Fast forward 4 years and I'm prescribed it again for tight muscles in my lower back, causing some sciatica and lower back arthritis. I've taken it about 4-5 days and my pain has actually gotten worse. I don't feel any positive effects from the medication whatsoever, no drowsiness, no pain relief. But I will say that I do believe it is negatively effecting my mood. I am also taking Elavil and noticed improvements with my mood while taking Elavil only. When Flexeril was added, on the 5th day I noticed my mood has drastically declined (depression/anxiety).",Anonymous
