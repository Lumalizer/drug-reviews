1,Naprosyn,Sciatica,10,,"May 6, 2014",94,"This was my last chance to get relief,  my dr had advised that if we couldn't get the nerve to relax,  surgery was the next option.  The medication helped,  the only thing I would only take this at bed time.  This medication is very strong and makes you very sleepy, but it really does work. I only had to use it for a short time.  I will not take any thing longer than a month and only when I have to.",BAD_BA
