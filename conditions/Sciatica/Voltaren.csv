0,Voltaren,Sciatica,4,,"April 18, 2021",4,"May help a little with sciatic nerve injury, and with arthritis, but after struggling for years to find the cause of severe rhinitis, stopped Voltaren, and now no sinus problems whatsoever.  I have a reaction to all oral pain meds, and now Voltaren also.  Cannot rate for others benefit because of my own reaction.",HarbourGirl
1,Voltaren,Sciatica,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 10, 2020",59,Iâ€™ve been struggling with sciatica for almost a decade. Voltaren is fine but I think I've found even a better one. It's called Acuraflex. I've just ordered it so it will come in a few days. I've seen that it has some good ingredients so I think it will be maybe even better than voltaren. Has anyone tried it yet?cheers,Charles

It took about 1 week to kick in and work but I honestly can say I take this in the am along with my muscle relaxer and gabepentin and I am pain free and gained back 6 hours of my life! IT only works for me so far for 6 hours and by the time I can take next dosages I am back in the worse pain ever, hopefully everyday I can gain a little bit more than 6 hours of my life back!!!!!!!!",Anonymous
