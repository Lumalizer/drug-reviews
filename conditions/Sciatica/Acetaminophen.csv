0,Acetaminophen,Sciatica,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 12, 2021",1,did not work for sciatica pain at all. Waste of money,red's girl
1,Acetaminophen,Sciatica,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 8, 2021",2,"I have had a major back surgery and after tons of morphine, oxycodone, and OxyContin, the only things that takes my low back pain to zero is Buprenorphine. No type of  injections worked either. However, the only thing, including all the opioids that helps my sciatic pain is Tylenol. I can’t take any NSAIDS due to kidney failure from Metformin and NSAIDS but they never helped my sciatica.",Eltee
2,Acetaminophen,Sciatica,6,,"November 1, 2020",1,Tylenol Extra Strength (acetaminophen):Tylenol and Tylenol extra strength didn’t help my sciatica pain    Tried Advil which helped the pain but made me feel flu symptoms,Sunny
3,Acetaminophen,Sciatica,10,,"October 25, 2020",3,acetaminophen works for my Sciatica mine. I get them from a medical professional. I use them until I can get a cortisone shot. showers do help.Many over doses are caused by people taking the same medicine so you have to make sure you don't go over the prescribed daily dosage.I need to eat to keep from having a upset tummy. Also with any aspirin you are suppose to drink milk not water.,miche
4,Acetaminophen,Sciatica,1,,"September 9, 2020",1,Tylenol doesn’t seem to help at all!,Gabriella
5,Acetaminophen,Sciatica,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 16, 2020",6,"Tylenol (acetaminophen):Tylenol did zero to help my Sciatic nerve pain, although it's helped in the past with other issues.  -  nothing else prescribed helped either but oddly enough Mocha flavoured monster drink would remove about 80% of the pain for about 5-8 hours. I have no idea why but it's the only relief I get.(except hot showers help too it seems)",Ron
6,Acetaminophen,Sciatica,7,,"May 19, 2020",1,I really recommend giving actaminophen a shot. for a while it’s the only thing that would get my through the night because of my lower back and hip pain. Nothing else worked even sleeping meds. It made me comfort enough to sleep through most of the night. I'm not sure if it was because it made me drowsy or it took away the pain but it’s really a life saver,wono

8,Acetaminophen,Sciatica,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 26, 2019",1,Did not do much for my pain. :(,TC216
9,Acetaminophen,Sciatica,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 5, 2019",15,"My doctor insisted I take acetaminophen in spite of me telling him it has never helped with any pain I have ever had, and surprise! It had no effect on my severe sciatica pain either.  I don't know why doctors keep prescribing it considering there are studies readily available to anyone who can read, that have proven that acetaminophen is no better than placebo when it comes to back pain relief (the Cochrane Reviews), AND  ""Analysis of national databases show that acetaminophen-associated overdoses account for about 50,000 emergency room visits and 25,000 hospitalizations yearly."" (Dr. Aric Hausknecht, a New York neurologist and pain management specialist.) My experience is that it doesn't work and I can read so I know it is ineffective period and is dangerous; and I am astonished and offended when a medical professional who should know better tells me to take it for any reason.",still hurting
