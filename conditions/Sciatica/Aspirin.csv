1,Aspirin,Sciatica,8,,"October 13, 2013",36,"I have severe sciatica as a result of cyst on L5.  Epidural failed, gave relief for a week before pain returned, and I am headed toward surgery to remove the cyst. I have found aspirin works better than Aleve (2 every 8 hours or 3 every 12 hours per my doc is OK)  , Advil and Tylenol, 10 MG Norco and Gabapentin although I am stepping up bit by bit to a full dose of gabapentin and maybe eventually that will help. On a scale of 1-10 my pain is a 10 and the aspirin will cut it down to a 3-4 for a couple of hours.",candy3389
2,Aspirin,Sciatica,7,,"August 17, 2009",44,"I am 35 year old male with moderate to severe sciatica (pain from buttock to ankle) due to bulging disc L5 - S1.  I found taking a 1000mg dose gave significant and almost total relief for about 1 to 2 hours.  The effect was greater if the pain was not too severe, the best results came from taking Aspirin before the pain got severe.  I also found that taking Aspirin without food made it work faster but I suffered stomach aches a consequence.",Mark P M
