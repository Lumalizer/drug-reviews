0,Flexeril,Sciatica,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 19, 2021",0,"I was prescribed this on two separate occasions, one was for TMJ issues 4 years ago. I heard really great things about this medication, including complete relief from pain and the ability to have a good night's rest. I took 10mg every night for a 30 days and didn't notice a difference in pain nor was there an improvement in my sleep. It did absolutely nothing. I could barely open my mouth enough to take a bite of food or to yawn. Fast forward 4 years and I'm prescribed it again for tight muscles in my lower back, causing some sciatica and lower back arthritis. I've taken it about 4-5 days and my pain has actually gotten worse. I don't feel any positive effects from the medication whatsoever, no drowsiness, no pain relief. But I will say that I do believe it is negatively effecting my mood. I am also taking Elavil and noticed improvements with my mood while taking Elavil only. When Flexeril was added, on the 5th day I noticed my mood has drastically declined (depression/anxiety).",Anonymous
1,Flexeril,Sciatica,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 8, 2021",12,I have a very bad sciatic nerve problem and it travels down my left leg and feels like somebody is shocking me whenever I hit a certain point or walk a certain way. So I started taking Flexeril and one day later I started feeling better it dulled the pain. But now I have pain in my middle back that feels like I have something there? Anyway I still feel pain but these definitely dull the sharp pain!,Keith

4,Flexeril,Sciatica,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 24, 2020",56,"I have just had severe sciatica pain in my left side with pain that goes whizzing down the front of my left leg.  I was given Flexeril and taking 800 mg Advil. Flexeril works slightly. I can walk well for about 2 hours. After that, it's agony every minute I'm at work. It wears off too fast. Slight short lasting relief won't get me through an 8 hour shift. Doctors don't seem to want to give out the stuff that DOES work. Such as Soma, Norco or Percocet. Torodol maybe. Tramadol maybe.  Anyway. Flexeril  gives 2 hours of slight relief.",My aching back
5,Flexeril,Sciatica,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 4, 2020",70,"Been Rx for this med Flexeril for years, I may take it once a month when I have a flare up from my chronic pain from Fibromyalgia . I’m also on Norco (hydrocodone) and take flexeral when needed. It takes 2 hours to start working and it knocks me out, I wake up with less pain and actually able to move in the morning before taking my pain medication. On 10mg, I cannot take it during the day, (I did in the beginning and didn’t notice much) but eventually to only at nighttime.",Miss

8,Flexeril,Sciatica,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 31, 2019",63,"I wish I could give Flexeril a rating of zero. I was diagnosed with sciatica 2 weeks ago and was given this medication. I do my physical therapy/stretching each day, but I feel like taking this medicine is useless. It doesn't relax my muscles at all. My pain was at a 9 two weeks ago, but now it's at a 12 after all the daily stretching. I'm in agonizing pain when I sit, walk, move, and Flexeril hasn't helped me at all. I'm glad it works for some people, but for me it works less than ibuprofen.",Chloe
9,Flexeril,Sciatica,6.0,,"December 9, 2018",27,"I'm on a lot of other scripts, so maybe others may or may not be helping. I'm taking two extra strength tylenol AM & PM with the flex, they usually help pretty good, but still hurts especially when sitting, standing or walking.",SCADAman

I only took it at night as soon as it wore off all the nerves took off worst then when I wasn't on it. I stopped the medicine and my body took 3 days to go back to normal.. I made appointment with chiropractor 3 weeks later and he could see the difference. The doctors don't always tell you the information you need. I been in 3 car wreaks with in 1 1/2 years and none of the doctors cought what this medicine was doing to me. I was suffering in alot of pain, all I could say is I'm better without Flexeril....",Bailey1cooper

13,Flexeril,Sciatica,2.0,,"May 30, 2015",54,"Was prescribed this for severe Sciatica and piriformis inflammation. This drug did absolutely NOTHING other than knock me out for few hours of deep sleep every time am bad drowsiness. I was then able to find some SOMA which is a miracle pain killer drug by comparison. Even better than the Percosets without apparent side effects. Yet, the doctors are completely paranoid to prescribe it unlike this useless Flexeril. Just check out the reviews on both drugs and compare.",Vacr2638
14,Flexeril,Sciatica,5.0,,"October 2, 2014",64,Flexeril makes me so drowsy that I fall asleep before I can feel actual relief of pain and then I miss out on everything. The only good thing is that it relaxes me so that I'm not tense.,Irish7373

My hydrocodone wasn't enough, I started taking Flexeril twice a day and the pain reduced to almost nothing and the burning down my legs stopped from my pinched nerves.
