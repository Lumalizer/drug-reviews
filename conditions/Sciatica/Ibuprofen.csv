0,Ibuprofen,Sciatica,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 9, 2022",0,Advil (ibuprofen):Advil works for me. I take 3-4 - 200mg capsules about every 6 hours. Relief takes about 30 minutes. I do worry about taking so much as I know it’ll mess up your stomach so I try not to take unless I REALLY need it.,Pst
1,Ibuprofen,Sciatica,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 26, 2021",2,"I have a very painful sciatica for past month, I took 500mg naproxen, which didn't help at all, advil helped a little bit, Pregabalin helps the best so far, 300mg in the morning 300mg before I sleep, but I would say its helps by 30 percent only, lumbar epidural steroid injection is my last resort.",Ali
2,Ibuprofen,Sciatica,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 30, 2020",15,Advil (ibuprofen):This is my first experience with sciatica...but its been 3 months. I am now taking Advil 2 capsules in the morning and 1 at night. I would like to stop but it helps too much.,dlc
3,Ibuprofen,Sciatica,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 20, 2020",12,Advil (ibuprofen):Taking Advil 800 mgs 3 times a day and it’s passable. For me it’s about staying ahead of the pain.,Syl711
4,Ibuprofen,Sciatica,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 13, 2020",21,I had excruciating pain in both legs after slipping down a few stairs.It lasted about a week and at that time I decided to go to hospital. It was sciatica. I was told to take Ibuprofen for 3 days. I believe 600mg every 8 hours and I couldn't believe how great I felt. I have it again and just taking two 200mg every 8 hours and starting to feel relief. This time was probably worse.,maxine12
5,Ibuprofen,Sciatica,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 5, 2019",9,"I have mild sciatica pain from time to time but after picking up my 25 pound granddaughter during a recent visit, and pulling a muscle in my hip, I developed sciatica so painful I literally could not sit down. My doctor suggested ice and heat and an Advil regimen. I started taking two Advil three times a day (200 mg tablets) and did this for six days. The pain just didn’t diminish. My doctor then prescribed a muscle relaxer so I started taking it while continuing with the Advil. Still no real improvement. I decided to stop the Advil as my son-in-law told me it was not good to take too much of it for a lengthy time. Well, after 24 hours of not taking the Advil I felt so much better!! I’m able to actually sit in a chair with no pain! I don’t know if the Advil was interfering with the muscle relaxer (baclofen) or whether it simply had not ever worked for me and I didn’t realize it.",BE
6,Ibuprofen,Sciatica,1.0,,"July 26, 2019",7,"In an eight hour period, I'd take 1600mgs of ibuprofen and not feel an improvement",deedle
7,Ibuprofen,Sciatica,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 29, 2018",12,"I have been taking ibuprofen and gabapentin for two months. I have decided to take just ibuprofen because of the side effects of gabapentin, but I am leary of the reports of heart attacks from ibuprofen. Anyone with information on this?",patcee14
8,Ibuprofen,Sciatica,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 22, 2017",19,"Extra strength (400 mg) liqui-gels are the only thing that seems to help with my sciatica. They do more than the Lyrica, delayed release naproxen, Tylenol 2's, and Extra Strength Tylenols combined. I take a high dose but  do not want to take narcotics and I have to be able to leave a half-way normal life.",PMcFee
9,Ibuprofen,Sciatica,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 16, 2017",16,"I have been an avid user of ibuprofen until this month 6/2017.  It worked wonders for my sciatic nerve pain until it stopped working and seemed to make my pain worse.  I found out I had an extreme vitamin D deficiency of 9 (normal range 30-100).  I started reading about the side effects and found I had several of them to include elevated liver enzymes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure.  The ibuprofen that I thought was helping actually depleted my vitamin D which is in a case study for my age group 47 and long term use of anti inflammatorys is been known to deplete vitamin D.  Vitamin D deficiency can be cause by long term use of ibuprofen and can cause muscle and bone pain.",LowD
10,Ibuprofen,Sciatica,7.0,,"February 14, 2017",27,"I have severe sciatica that is absolutely devastating to my lifestyle. I drive a lot and the pain is excruciating. 800mg of Ibuprofen provides relief in about an hour to an hour and a half and from a dose to pain returning is about 3 to 3 and a half hours. It's not much, but it's the only think giving me a respite from what is otherwise excruciating pain. I'm starting to get routine heartburn for the first time in years after taking this routinely for three months. Starting to worry about the stomach side effects. Can also be hard on the kidneys.",JanieRock
11,Ibuprofen,Sciatica,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 10, 2016",41,"800 mg helped with my pain. It takes about an hour to work then pain is manageable. I have minimal side effects, a little headachy and slightly tired. I can take this and get relief without feeling drugged.",Suzyqszoo
12,Ibuprofen,Sciatica,1.0,,"May 27, 2012",14,I would suggest taking Naproxen rather than Ibuprofen for this.  500 mg of Naproxen works.  I have tried both and Naproxen is superior.  Ibuprofen does nothing for me.,Anonymous
13,Ibuprofen,Sciatica,8.0,,"October 13, 2009",61,Advil (ibuprofen):Taking up to 800mg Ibuprofen for persistent sciatica. It is more effective than Tylenol with codeine which didn't help - relief lasting about 1 hour. ,Davee3
14,Ibuprofen,Sciatica,7.0,,"August 16, 2009",48,"I am 35 year old male with moderate to severe sciatica (pain from buttock to ankle) due to bulging disc L5 - S1.  I found taking a 400mg dose gave significant but not total relief for about 2 to 3 hours.  The effect was greater if the pain was not too severe, the best results came from taking ibuprofen before the pain got severe.  I also found that taking Ibuprofen without food made it work faster but I suffered moderate diarrhea as a consequence.",Mark P M
