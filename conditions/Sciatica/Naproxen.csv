2,Naproxen,Sciatica,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 25, 2021",0,"I have been taking Naproxen for severe menstrual cramps for about 5 years now. It helps relieve lower back pain and loosen pain in my abdomen. I just recently started experiencing sciatic nerve pain. I’ve seen a chiropractor. Stretched. Hot-tub. Exercise in pool. Heat. Ice. I cannot lay down at night and have been sleeping upright for 2 weeks now. I’ve become desperate for relief and sleep. I took one of my naproxen 500 one night and have never felt more relieved. However, since I’ve been taking it for so long, I’ve noticed a slight tolerance and stomach sensitivity. Take it only when you really need it.",emily

12,Naproxen,Sciatica,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2018",30,Prescribed 500mg twice a day of naproxen along with codeine and oramorph for my first sciatic episode.  I stopped the oramorph after a couple of days as I hated the way it made me feel and the codeine lasted about 5 days. Now had 5 days of just the naproxen. The pain is unbearable in the morning and don't know if the pain goes to a manageable level because I start to move or because my morning dose has kicked in. I'm getting some weird side effects like numb fingers and bad stomach pains so I don't know if i should quit taking the drug to see if i still need it or not?,Kara

15,Naproxen,Sciatica,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 30, 2018",11,Sciatica pain was severe and switched from ibuprofen Advil to naproxen Aleve and found absolutely no difference whatsoever. Excruciating pain never subsided and barely took the edge off. Am now trying AC&C which has always worked as a pain killer for me probably due to the mix if Aspirin Caffeine and Codeine. I have read that sciatica does not necessarily need an anti inflammatory. At least I slept 5 hours straight on AC&C,BritCrit

18,Naproxen,Sciatica,,,"September 16, 2017",14,"2 Weeks ago I developed severe lower back pain, I went to my chiropractor for 2 treatments thinking this would solve the problem, was out of action for a week. Then it flared up again just when I thought it was gone. I am supposed to be starting a new job on Monday, but woke up Saturday morning in severe pain down my left leg, throbbing burning pain, and my ankle and foot had no feeling..... so all I have is a tablet called INZA and paracetemol, I can't drive the manual car to the doctor to get an injection as I can't even walk properly and have no feeling in the leg. I'm seeing the physio on Monday, I wonder if this will help as they do work the muscles which might help the disk go back to normal, is this going to be a life long problem?",POP Dolly
19,Naproxen,Sciatica,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 16, 2017",15,"Had sciatica since December. I was prescribed Naproxen 500g twice a week but didn't want to take any meds. It went well but 15th May it flared up to a point I couldn't stay stand, seat, lay without excrutiating pain. I started taking pain killers I had at home when I get my period AKA Tesco's 30p and 60p:  200 Ibuprofen, Patacetamol 500, Paracetamol Extra 500 (with caffeine) and Extra Power Pain Control 500 (Parancetamol/Aspirin/Cafeine). I try to go 3 days paracetamols then 5 Ibuprofen with 1 day with no med in between. After 4 crippling weeks at home I finally managed to walk to a pharmacy to buy Naproxen. I have been taking it for a week. No relief. The Tesco meds were more effective at easing the pain. Naproxen do not work for me at all",JaLee

22,Naproxen,Sciatica,8.0,,"June 20, 2016",20,"Was originally given naproxen for dental pain. but didnt use it all, I read leaflet and saw it helps nerve pain as my sciatica flared up again now lasting ten weeks onwards. I took one yesterday and one today and its eased quite a bit. My worse time is when I get up am hobbling around on one leg until nerve settles. still get the pins needles in foot and leg, but the naproxin seems to ease the actual pain and relax the nerves. It does not make the pain go but just relaxes it. It works for some and not for others but guess same with all medicines. I have tried to manage without pain killers and didnt want to end up reliant on them. but its that or having severe pain 24.7. London Uk dont pay for meds covered via other conditions.",Music Lady

43,Naproxen,Sciatica,9.0,,"January 19, 2011",50,"I recently acquired sciatica and it is painful at times. Usually at the end of the day after walking. I started a new job that has stairs everywhere (along with elevators) Using the stairs everyday seems to have helped it (hanging on to the rails). But, the Naproxen twice a day is helping me to use the stairs. Naproxen once a day wasn't cutting it. Just one floor at a time, then the elevator. I'm convinced that the inflammation is the culprit as it causes tendons to become sticky and grind tendons against muscles when moving causing pain incrementally as the day progresses.
