1,Diclofenac,Sciatica,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2022",3,I have chronic Sciatica nerve damage and have been taking diclofenac for foot pain. Taking diclofenac has greatly reduced my Sciatica pain. I am so pleased and thankful to be relieved from this pain.,Anonymous
2,Diclofenac,Sciatica,9,,"July 8, 2021",24,I have had sciatic pain for 20 years now @ 44 years old I have finally found this drug and it worked wonders in 50mg dose. I would be hobbling around like a senior without it and I only need a 2 a day for a couple of days and I’m back to normal. This works for me. I would say try it if you want to get your life back. I wouldn’t wish sciatica pain on anyone it can ruin your life.,Dylan
3,Diclofenac,Sciatica,4,,"April 18, 2021",4,"Voltaren (diclofenac):May help a little with sciatic nerve injury, and with arthritis, but after struggling for years to find the cause of severe rhinitis, stopped Voltaren, and now no sinus problems whatsoever.  I have a reaction to all oral pain meds, and now Voltaren also.  Cannot rate for others benefit because of my own reaction.",HarbourGirl
4,Diclofenac,Sciatica,8,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 13, 2020",31,"I have tried many drug combinations over the years. Some were...ok, and some didn’t do a thing for my Sciatica. Then my VA doctor put me on Diclofenac, among with GabapentIn. I can honestly say this stuff works for me! It’s doesn’t take the pain away 100%...but enough to live my life again.",Ned
5,Diclofenac,Sciatica,6,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 26, 2020",34,"I have had sciatica for years now (age 66) and I have experimented with many drugs.  My physician has me on 75 mg dose of diclofenac twice a day.  I can't tell the difference between one or two pills a day, but if I stop taking pills completely,  the pain is very unpleasant.  So this does help, but I have to stop and take a break  several times during my two mile walks each day.  That allows the pain and numbness to temporarily get better in my butt and legs.  Muscle relaxants are scary as they leave me zoned out and unsafe to drive and they don't always take away the pain.  This generic for voltaren is the best thing yet I've tried that has the least amount of side effects.",Hondoman45
6,Diclofenac,Sciatica,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 20, 2020",10,"I've suffered and tried everything without help until I tried Voltaren 1% emulgel. I put it from the lower back, along the nerve and to the heel. The first time took a week to work with twice daily application. After that I am careful to use it as soon as the flare starts so I nip it in a day or two. I got greedy and tried the stronger version - did not work. A doctor prescribed an even stronger one to be made in a pharmacy and that made me sick in one application. Now that it is readily available where I live I stick to the 1% gel and say praise to who ever created it...this is an off label application, I am not a doctor and it did not work for my husband. I have fewer flare ups now but I also had a Shockwave treatment that helped me a couple years ago... again it did not work for my husband so stay safe and may you find what works for you.",Ella
7,Diclofenac,Sciatica,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 10, 2020",59,Voltaren (diclofenac):I’ve been struggling with sciatica for almost a decade. Voltaren is fine but I think I've found even a better one. It's called Acuraflex. I've just ordered it so it will come in a few days. I've seen that it has some good ingredients so I think it will be maybe even better than voltaren. Has anyone tried it yet?cheers,Charles
8,Diclofenac,Sciatica,1,,"October 31, 2019",14,I'm only 36 and I  can't walk more than 20 yards without wanting to sit down due to the pain from my sciatica.  Diclofenac does nothing for me at all. I told the VA I take around 3000mg a day in ibuprofen and it doesn't  do anything for me then they gave this garbage medication thinking it would help paired with baclofen 10 mg BID. As I type this I feel so sleepy from the over recommended baclofen dosage and I'm still in pain. That's the VA for you,Anonymous

10,Diclofenac,Sciatica,10,,"January 25, 2019",54,Voltaren (diclofenac):If you apply the ointment/gel cover it up with a piece Saranwrap - no need to wait for it to dry and it can incubate that way without anybody noticing. Try to do this when you feel the first signs of sciatica...that'll do the trick.,anonymous

12,Diclofenac,Sciatica,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 25, 2018",21,"Absolutely life changing. I’m 22 year old with sciatic pain and back pain. Keeps pain very very manageable, and allows me to live a relatively normal life. Don’t know what I’d do without it. I do worry about long term consequences, such as cardiac risks,  stomach ulcers but for now cost is highly outweighed by the benefit. Best is 50mg dispersible tablets for rapid relief, or 75mg slow release every 12 hours for day to day relief.",ibman9215

19,Diclofenac,Sciatica,7,,"September 14, 2014",29,I was prescribed 50mg twice a day. I felt really good after 2 days. Went back to spin class (lightly) and light cycling. Then I felt good and did an elliptical. My Dr never told me to refrain from working out. After 26 years it's a hard habit to break. So I am in week 3. If I stand too long Sciatica returns. Some walks are good. He is doing this for 3 months. I hope it helps. I don't want cortisone injections.,TerryP1957
