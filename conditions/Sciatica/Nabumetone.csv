I went from not sleeping due to pain in my right leg to sleeping the whole night through.  Also, I had become so stiff it was hard getting up and down out of chairs and out of the car.  With this medicine, I am up and down like a normal 40 year old, rather than an 80 year old.  I am so very grateful for this medicine.",Anonymous
