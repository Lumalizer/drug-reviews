I have been searching for this name of this medicine for years.  My condition had returned after 30  years and I account that to the Michigan swamps 5 years ago.  Well I'll say short of cutting off your lower torso, nothing works on this condition.  Dermatologists, doctors and MD's all give the standard non hydro-creams and powders.  They only head the danger times but do not cure. Vietnam Vet pharmacist help me out on Fulvicin.  Now I must spell it for my Michigan Doctor. GOD bless those who served.",KEITH IN MICHIGAN
