0,Terbinafine,Tinea Cruris,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2021",2,"Lamisil (terbinafine):I was prescribed Lamisil to use for 2 weeks to treat mild jock itch. after the first week, the symptoms got much worse (swelling, burning, itching and spreading) the second week I started loosing my taste and smell and the symptoms did not improve at all. Started using another broad spectrum antifungal cream and the Jock itch was completely destroyed within 3 days. I will not recommend Lamisil to anyone!",Anonymous

3,Terbinafine,Tinea Cruris,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 19, 2019",7,"I had terrible terrible terrible rash and itch, it had spread in large area. I had used itch guard coconut oil, Vit E oil but nothing worked. Then  I bought one tube of terbinafine cream and it has worked wonders on the jock itch I almost suffered for 1 month with this rash and I got rid of all those in just 3 days, will keep on using if for a while though. It did nothing to the scars but my itching completely vanished  and it made my skin smooth within 1week.. it is amazing",Any
