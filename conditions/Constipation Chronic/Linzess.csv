1,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 29, 2022",0,"After reading the reviews here, I was worried about taking the drug for moderate constipation. Here’s my story:  I’ve been getting worsening constipation since quitting smoking 15 years ago at age 35.  I always eat healthy whole foods (not processed), exercise 3-5 days per week and drink over 50 oz of water daily and still have constipation!  2 years ago I developed SIBO -a bacterial overgrowth of the intestines associated with constipation IBS and the like.   My experience with Linzess 145 mcg capsules: great!I did not have diarrhea at all, no cramps either.  It’s not a complete cure for me, I still take Miralax twice a week plus keeping up my healthy eating and exercise.  If I don’t drink water, it won’t work as well.  Also, it took a couple of months for me to get regular but I finally am regular and have been for the last 3 months.",Chris
2,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 29, 2022",0,"Expensive and ineffective.  I was taking 1 pill of dulcolax each night and doctor recommended Linzess.  Not only was it extremely expensive $250 for first month with double insurance and coupon (I'm in my 50s), but it didn't seem to do anything the first few days.  Days 3-5 I had extreme pain and  extremely loose stools. I could get the same result with the $5.00 bottle of milk of magnesium.I am eating less processed carbs now and take high dose vitamin c and 400 mg of magnesium before I go to bed.  This seems to work better along with 2-3 x per week of dulcolax",betteD
3,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 18, 2022",0,Just started on 145 mg. Had to visit ER at last resort for such pain. All blood work and x-rays were fine. All xray's found was constipation. My first week on Linzess seemed to work. Two days of diarrhea and felt better. It all stopped and pain started again. Called my doctor and hope he will increase dosage. Cannot go through all the nights in pain. Most reviews are great ones. So wish me luck.,Hopefull
4,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2022",0,"I’ve had constipation all my life. Just started linzess a week ago. It’s a roller coaster ride. Some days nothing but when it works, there’s no time to get to the toilet! I literally had no warning and had to get in the shower to wash myself off. It was very liquidy and a horrible odor. So when it works, be near a toilet about 30 minutes after taking it or there will be a big mess. At least I’m going. Just be prepared to not go anywhere for up to two hours. My stomach gurgles all day also.",Sharon

6,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2022",1,"I was prescribed Linzess after being backed up for more than 3 weeks. A trip to the ER and what felt like an exorcism of my colon later, the GI gave me this. The first couple of days taking it my stomach cramping was still happening and I had a lot of discomfort. Taking it regularly produces bowel movements on a regular basis. Once I was going every couple of days I stopped taking it and started getting backed up again. Took it with the hopes of it working later in the evening, but it worked within an hour or two and I was racing for the toilet at a family gathering /:",Jamie

I take on empty stomach as soon as I wake up and it usually kicks in about 2-3 hours later and can give me up to 4 bowel movements all morning so you definitely want to be near a bathroom and I take the lowest dose.

8,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 12, 2021",1,"Linzess worked wonders for me at first. 30 days after starting the medication I experienced an episode of full-body hives that landed me in the ER. At first I did not suspect that the Linzess had anything to do with it, but after a second reaction 2 months later, I made the connection and had to stop taking it.

9,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 9, 2021",0,"Linzess did act like a laxative. It produced a diarrhea effect 100% of the time I took it. Within about 3-5 hours, I needed to run to a toilet! I was no longer constipated, that's for sure!",Nee G
10,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 6, 2021",1,They wanted $1600 for three months. I have Blue Cross insurance too. They offered $200 discount card from the company. Just to harvest my personal information. Total rip off for a laxative. This is just a laxative nothing special. Over the counter stimulant laxatives are much better if you just want diarrhea like this stuff does when it works. Long term use has much reduced effectiveness. I have serious ISB-C and this company is just taking advantage of people who are ill. Miralax and Fleet suppositories are a much better option.,Brooks
11,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 8, 2021",1,Be very careful your first 2 weeks on linzessYou may want to sleep separate from your partner! I pooped myself while sleeping twice in one night! I’m going to go get depends until the side effects wear off,Windy
12,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 7, 2021",0,"Previously I had to have an ileostomy because of colonic inertia and mega colon. I wouldn't go for days and had unsuccess trips to the ER for enemas. I had it reversed and have been on Linzess. It is a God send. Now I am able to go just about every morning. If it weren't for Linzess, I'm sure I would have had to have a horrible (for me) ileostomy again. Because of that, I'd rate it 10/10. I take it about 20 min before I eat breakfast, then it makes me go about 45min or so after taking it.One more thing...my part D may cover it and an extremely high co-pay or they didn't cover it. I don't remember. I do remember that the  monthly cost was outrageous. So, my GI doctor gave me a prescription for it that I now get out of Canada, instead. I had to set it all up with them and send them a copy of my prescription from my doctor.",CK 7

I have had some luck with low fodmap diet and miralax and milk of magnesia. Just wanted better motility and more complete BMs and less pain. Doctor gave me samples of the Linzess 290mcg capsules. I had diarrhea and liquid stools for two days. Then nothing without Milk of Magnesia the next 5 days. Then woke up with gut wrenching pain in my chest and vomiting and passing out. Went to the ER. They say I am extremely bloated and constipated. No surprise there!. Went back to doctor. He said the Linzess will work. Just give it time. I am weak, belly distended, feel nauseous, and feel faint.

16,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,5.0,,"September 19, 2021",0,"I have had chronic constipation for probably 20 years. I started having bowel incontinence when I have diarrhea. I felt so ashamed and alone I didn’t go to the doctor for a long time. When I finally did she said she thinks my diarrhea is caused by my chronic constipation so to regulate me she prescribed Linzess. I was sooooo scared it would cause diarrhea I would not take it for a year! But my issue persisted so I gave it a try. It does not work every day and sometimes it does bring on loose stool. When it does I get scared so I stop for a week or so and then start again. I feel like such an odd duck. Has anybody experienced this? And also can anyone share how they took linzess and what you did to assist it in working effectively, like taking a certain time, or with warm or cold water, those kinds of things.

19,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 5, 2021",2,I have taken Linzess for over 6 years.  It worked good 95 percent of the time.  A friend of mine asked me to try 1 cup of prune juice in the morning.  WOW it worked as good as Linzess.  It works so good I take it every other day.  In about 1-1/2 hours you had better start to the bathroom.  Been on prune juice 6 months.  Did not need Linzess.  I don't know if it is for everyone but it worked for me.,Phil H
20,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 31, 2021",2,"I have been taking this med at 145 mg for about two months. It does work, but it's very harsh. Within three hours of taking it, I'll have an intense bout or two of diarrhea that wrings me out completely. A few days of this in a row leaves me feeling fatigued, so I  alternate: two days with Linzess, two days without. Side effects include feeling very bloated and a weird stomachache that I can only describe as a raw, torn up feeling. I've also had a few accidents, especially in the first week of taking. What a mess. So altogether it's not ideal, but it's better than never going to the bathroom at all.",Serene Celine
21,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 28, 2021",0,"I've had severe constipation for most of my life. I tried linzess for about a week the first time and got so backed up that I had to double dose miralax for 3 days before having a bowel movement. It also made me feel horribly dehydrated and crappy when I woke up. The doctor suggested I take 2 pills (max dose). Because of how crappy I felt on 1 pill, and wondering if I have it the courage try. The first time I followed all the directions (wait 30 minutes/take on empty stomach/etc) I stuck with one, made sure to not eat for 30 minutes, and drink extra water. After almost 2 months, I still felt crappy and dehydrated and was always constipated. After over a month of taking it every morning, I was still constipated and never had a normal bowel movement. I went days sometimes without going. On the first day I finally skipped it, I had a decent bowel movement! I'll stick to miralax.

23,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 29, 2021",0,"My gastrointestinal doctor gave me some samples to try for my chronic constipation,  it was literally the first pill I've ever taken for this problem that worked in every way.  I took mine at bedtime and the next morning immediately had to go and for the first time ever I think,  I had a complete bowel movement.  I can't explain how wonderful that feels when you are used to sitting on a toilet for ever without results.  I was extremely happy to have finally found a drug that agreed with me and did a wonderful job.  My doctor wrote me a prescription on more than two occasions in the past two years and my insurance still won't cover any of it and I certainly can't afford it so I'm back to feeling bloated and miserable and like the commercial on TV I'm back to being crankypated.

31,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,9.0,,"July 9, 2021",80,"I've had bowel issues forever. Metamucil barely helped. My gastro suggested Linzess. I was nervous reading the side effects, but tried for a month.Side effects are worth it! You go a lot after taking it. Diarrhea was worse at first. Now it depends on how much I eat. On bad days I skip a dose. Definitely make sure you have bathroom access the first few hours after taking it. Haven't had an accident, but you get strong urges! Also do not trust farts! Also, linzess bowel movements have a very distinct smell.My only issue is cost. It's extremely expensive and my insurance only covers some of it. I used Care Credit and got a coupon card from Linzess.com. But I don't have long term options. There is no generic option, and it feels like punishment for being low income & having health issues.

I could go 3-4 weeks taking all of the above daily and still not be able to go to the bathroom. I had tried a lower strength of Linzess years ago and it did nothing for me. I asked my doctor to prescribe it again out of sheer desperation.This time I was put on 290 mcg. I am experiencing much more positive results.

I take the maximum dosage once a day and wanted to give some advice. Take the pill several hours before you want it to work and then provide enough time to complete the bathroom cycle. As an example, I am an early riser and get up at 3 AM. I like to be finished in the bathroom by about 7 or 8 AM. So, I take my pill at about 10-11 PM the night before. The pill needs some time to travel through your system and to get working in your colon. I have not experienced any side effects other than the loose stools.

The only way I seem to be able to have a bowel movement is if I take a medication that states "" do not take with Methadone"" which throws me into the shaking sweats & cramping of withdrawal for 4 hrs after which I have to take 2 doses of my Methadone to bring me past withdrawal & back to the point before the medication binded with the Methadone.",Suzy

I had previously tried Amitza and several other medications my doctor recommended. I was diagnosed celiac about 7 years ago and changed my diet. I still had stomach issues and constipation so I continued the Linzess. After years of limiting my diet to less than the low fodmap elimination diet I still continued to be constipated, have trapped gas, extreme bloating and terrible stomach pain. I didn’t take my Linzess for two days so I could do a hydrogen breath test just to be sure it didn’t effect results. ALL of my symptoms went away. I felt like a completely new person. I’ve even tried a few things off the low fodmap list and felt fine! So sorry I didn’t question this med years ago. It has caused so much pain and even a trip to the Mayo Clinic to try to figure out my problems. ☹️ If you don’t think it’s doing much for you or you have these symptoms, get off of it ASAP!",Uli5

75,Linzess,Constipation Chronic,8.0,,"March 12, 2020",149,Linzess really works well if you time it right. It can be predictable if you take it at the same time each morning. You will have a normal movement followed by some muddy diarrhea and then after 3-4 hours it just stops and you feel much better. Sometimes I have to pair it with a couple senna. The only bad side effect is I can’t sleep much because it’s constantly working on your system. It can be a little messy but if you time it right...it’s a dream! Give it a chance! Remember some pills are stronger than others. Make sure you always store it in a room temperature dry environment. I find it ok to skip a day here and there if you have a busy schedule and you can just pick right back up where you left off the following day.

I guess you can say it works but at what price? I need to go to work. I thought if I changed the time of day I was taking it that would help. It just became a nuisance.

I have results in about an hour or so and it lasts about 2 hours. It does work, so not sure if people are taking as prescribed but have learned it's cycle. I take it once through my work week, and then on the weekends. I feel better after being able to empty my bowels. I do drink fluids after taking the dosage.  I am on the mid level dosage. The lowest dose wasn't as successful for me.  So I so far have enjoyed the medication to relieve life long constipation, but my only word of caution, learn how it works for you.

For me it is sometimes hard to get to the bathroom before I go on myself. There are times I go 5 to 8 days with no bowel movement  so taking Linzess even though somewhat unpredictable is a God send. I would suggest anyone starting Linzess do so on a day where you are home and can have a chance to see how it is going to work.

This drug worked for me as I have a long history of mega-colon and chronic constipation. Even taking Magnesium carbonate (the fizzy kind), I'd have diarrhea  that would flow around the extensive compacted stool throughout the large bowel. Also, fiber would only create inflammation in my intestines. Linzess is minimally absorbed which is good as I usually react badly to most modern drugs. I started on the low dose (72mcg) first and then tried the medium (145mcg) dose, which seems better. It took about 2 weeks to eliminate most of the compacted stool, so it may take a while to perceive effective results.",Ecgberht

I’m on the 145mg dosage but after reading so many reviews from others I’m highly doubtful that the 290mg will work for long term.  I’m sick of hearing the same blah blah from the doctors drink more water, exercise, eat bulk fiber foods. I do all that, I drink plenty of water, run three miles a day and eat more roughage than my horse and I’m still constipated.

I had no idea that linzess was causing this until I read all of the user reviews and they sound just like what I’m experiencing.  Back to magnesium citrate capsules and milk of magnesia.  This is not worth it.  I also read about 8 fatalities and 25 people being hospitalized after using it.  It’s crazy!  I will never touch this again and I’m only on 72 mcg.

I used it but it has always given me flu-like symptoms. Body aches, nausea, headache, did not like it. I also found that with all these drugs you have to start low on whatever dosage works for you, but your body develops a tolerance for it over time and you need to up the dosage. I was having to take more Amitiza, making me feel sicker. When Linzess came out in my mid 50’s, it worked for me and It does not make me sick.

I recently tried it daily and some days it worked and others I had to double up as it wasn't enough then I was on the toilet for again up to 5 hours. I read some scary reviews about this medication causing deaths people? and so many horrific health issues. If you google it you will see the reports. It feels that I am trapped at home taking this and then have bloating like crazy and it doesn't feel positive. I am going to stop taking it and going back to natural fibre pills and herbal laxatives. I take a natural mild laxative with rhubarb root and aloe in it and it works much better all at once rather than this one is explosive and watery with no warning.

First morning I took it and had a bowel movement the next morning and it was a substantial and well formed movement. Later that night before bed, I had an urge and had another significant bowel movement. Second day same situation and had good bowel movement when I got up (within 2 hours). If this stays effective and no side effects emerge, my life has changed wonderfully forever. I could not travel before and had to wear a depends after magnesium as I never knew when I would get hit for about 16 hours. I have had no diarrhea with Linzess or bloating or pain. I hope prices go down or a generic occurs as I paid about $350.00 for 30 290mg capsules. Also, I pray that nothing occurs where this shows over time to have any negative side effects. I took Amitiza over 10 years ago and had agony and very poor results. I lost faith in all new drugs as they all panned out to have some serious problems so I waited on Linzess for over 5 years before trying it. No horror stories emerged and now, unless it stops working, I'm truly amazed after 20 + years of constant constipation. I didn't have over two or three Bm'S in 20 years without a magnesium product and they were getting more frequent for use with age. I'm happy to write this because I had given up and had considered having a colostomy or colectomy if I was a candidate. 10 stars for Linzess!",Hornbeak

The big problem for me was that just going ""normal"" to the bathroom was not enough for me. When the stool just got a little harder I felt real bad, I couldn't think right, got in a bad mood, felt like intoxicated. In my opinion, my bowels let too many toxins go into my body. As such, I had to take laxative when other person might not need it. Linzess seems to prevent the toxins to go into my body and in doing so, it has had an extraordinary effect on me.
