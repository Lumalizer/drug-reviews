1,Lactulose,Constipation Chronic,10.0,,"November 27, 2021",0,"Brand: XactDoseManufacturer: VistaPharmDose: 20g/30mLGreat results with this medication. I was using Miralax for a few days (4 or so) but didn't get any results. I then took XactDose after going to a doctor. First day taking it, I felt really gassy & bloated within 3-4 hours. My second  day I experienced the same things, only this time I actually expelled a good amount stool. It felt like a decent burden was done away with and I felt lighter.  It's my go to whenever I get really constipated, it works very well.  Didn't get same results with generic lactulose (10g/15mL) that I got after I ran out of XactDose. I even tried a double dose of it. Maybe I should've tried one more day with the doubled dose?Oh, and it seems like Sam's Club pharmacy is the only  place that is able to get this for you now. Many pharmacies don't  have it. Call around and ask for lactulose made by the manufacturer VistaPharm and save yourself some gas.",Honesty Pays Of

Water, fiber, exercise etc doesn’t help. I took lactulose for 4 days and was about to give up and take a stimulant laxative. I thank whatever higher power that’s up there that I waited another 20 minutes because all hell broke loose. I was in the bathroom for 42 straight minutes with a constant bowel movement. Honestly debated on calling 911 a time or two or praying I could get up long enough to get water. Is it a pleasant experience? No. Is it better than hemorrhoids, anal fissures and being completely unable to have a BM? Yup. 100%. Also pro tip, mix it with about a 1/2 cup to a cup (measuring cup) of apple juice. Completely masks the taste.",Patience

I then knocked it down to 15ml similar times and hurrahhhhhhh I have found the perfect dose.  I have been 5 mornings in a row, comes out easily and formed.

16,Lactulose,Constipation Chronic,7.0,,"January 10, 2021",35,Overall after being on high doses of pain meds constipation has gotten worse and worse over the last year. I've tried many things and the only thing that's really helping is lactulose. Some people might find this medicine not so good or it doesn't work but for me this has been kind of life-saving. Within 3-6 hours I know I'll be going to the bathroom. It does relieve constipation pretty fast. It all depends on your weight and how much of this stuff you want to put into your body.... Without this I would be in tears crying. I have even been to the emergency room. Mixing this with Linzess is best. I advise anybody to try this because it has been very successful for me..There are many days that I still have constipation but lactulose does eventually work when you get the right dosing in your body..

Until I was four I thought it was normal. I've bounced from specialist to specialist. Nobody can give me a diagnosis, but all I knew was the feces buildup was releasing toxins into my body and it was just unhealthy. An xray of my torso showed that the buildup was literally putting pressure on my lungs and it had impacted my breathing. Specialists gave me one of two options: laxatives or surgery. So, I tried countless laxatives, diets, exercise regimens. The only thing that's helped so far in my 15 years of life is sennas and enemas, both of which are extremely painful and give me awful diarrhea. Until lactulose. It's helped tremendously, and I can have natural movements. The only uncomfortable thing is all the flatulence, but that's better than curling up into a ball in pain.",Anon

46,Lactulose,Constipation Chronic,8.0,,"March 14, 2018",28,I’m 17 weeks pregnant and have been struggling even before I found out I was pregnant to empty my bowels. Before I fell pregnant it was normal for me to poo once a week. I can’t even remember when I had my last bowel movement it was over a week ago and very small. I rushed to the pharmacy today to get something as my stomach feels bloated and painful. I took 45mls and within half an hour I started feeling sick and an hour after that I started cramping. 3 hours later I’m shooting to the toilet before I end up having an accident. What started off as a normal stool turned into explosive diarrhoea. But I guess with 7+ days of waste in me it was going to be a bit of a mess. So glad I took this however I wouldnt recommend taking before work/going out etc as it can be unpredictable as to when it will take effect. Also the wind is a bit embarrassing so better to be in the comfort of your own home. I would recommend.,Anonymous

Could just be coincidence and unconnected to the lactulose but after digging deep into an FDA site I found that 5%  of users find it can cause some type of heartbeat irregularity - AF, palpitations, slow beats, fast beats etc. Hope that is useful to someone.",Kenleigh

58,Lactulose,Constipation Chronic,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 31, 2016",52,Since I began taking lactulose I have seen a marked improvement with chronic constipation. Before beginning with this med I would sometimes not have a BM for 10days. Since  starting this medication I have been having 4-5 BMs a week which should increase even more as my md. increases my dosage at my next appt.Besides the relief I have experienced I also enjoy the pleasant taste as previous meds were horrible tasting.I would recommend this medicine as a very good treatment for chronic constipation.,Latina Lover
59,Lactulose,Constipation Chronic,10.0,,"March 12, 2016",60,"I have had chronic constipation most of my life and never thought too much about it just accepted it. I've been on pain meds for close to 6 yrs and they are definitely making it worse that I'm having pain which concerned me so I had a CT scan to make sure the pain wasn't coming from something serious, so the Dr felt the constipation was the cause. I'm on day 1 of this stuff and I was prescribed 30 mil 3x day. I waited for a day I could be home in case it got bad. I had my first bowel movement about 1 hr. after dose and 3 total since the 1st dose. (took 3 hrs ago)  I think I'm gonna stick with 1 a day for now and if it slows down then add the second dose and work my way up if nessasary. It taste like honey but thinner consistency.",Nytink
60,Lactulose,Constipation Chronic,7.0,,"January 14, 2016",52,I have early menopause related constipation . For last 5 years moderate constipation . I've used lots of things - with success but also with fear of dependence . People have recommended lactulose as a non dependent choice. I take 30 mls night . It gives me a lot of wind . It does work but it is an accumulative effect that takes about 4 days of regularly dosing to start working and produce a bowel movement ... Not sure why so many others are lucky enough to get success the same day ???  .,Early menopause constipation

Before my Doctor prescribed this to me I couldn't produce a bowel movement for a month I was really sick I couldn't eat or drink for days at a time, I was running fevers I couldn't walk and I was fainting. I take 90 ml three times a day, its a really high dose so be sure to take your own recommended dose, but I can now use the bathroom at least twice a day. My stools were literally compacted and now I am all cleared out. I highly recommend this medication.",jenny1712

I've tried senna, Movicol and they'd take at least 5 days to work. And the taste of 2 Movicol sachets with 250ml, was yuck. Also made me bloated. I've started lactulose on 15ml 3 times a day but around 2 hours after taking 15ml I was going to the bathroom! It's very convenient too as I just add the 15ml to a drop of juice/squash. Very happy to have found something so good but it does cause me a lot of wind.",MissMarie2015

I take 80ml-100ml which is a dose I wouldn't recommend to someone taking it for the first time. Start small and see how it works for you. I take it right before bed. And by the time I wake up, it's toilet time, every time. Sometimes I will get a slight pain in my stomach during sleeping and it can't wait till my usual wake up time.",Just a guy

71,Lactulose,Constipation Chronic,10.0,,"August 17, 2011",78,I would go up to one month without having bowel movements.  I'm very afraid of using medicine because I take medication for epilepsy and I do not want any interactions causing the anticonvulsants to be less or not effective.  My doctor gave me lactulose and told me to drink water with it.  He said not to be worried about it interfering with my medicine because what the lactulose does is pull water into the stool to make it soft.  I still don't take it with my daily medication.  I wait at least 3 hours after or 4 hours prior to taking my daily medication.  The only thing I do not like is it is very sweet.  Check to see if it is okay to take if you are diabetic.  I assume it has sugar in it because of the sweetness.,Anonymous
