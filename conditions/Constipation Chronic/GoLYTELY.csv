0,GoLYTELY,Constipation Chronic,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 20, 2021",3,"It tastes terrible but here's how I do it and it works super well. Have a 8 oz cup of GoLYTELY, an 8 oz glass of water and a cup of mouthwash ready to go next to each other. Hold your nose and drink the GoLYTELY as fast as possible, then IMMEDIATELY rinse your mouth with mouthwash after you swallow the GoLYTELY. Spit out the mouthwash and drink the glass of water. Repeat every 10-15 minutes until you have completed your GoLYTELY consumption. I had absolutely no problem at all with the taste doing this. I was peeing out of my butt in no time, and that part is not fun, but the prep itself was a breeze using this method. Good luck!",JCG
1,GoLYTELY,Constipation Chronic,6,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 19, 2021",3,"I have a disease called hischsprungs that causes chronic constipation and every 2 years or so I have to do a complete clean out. I've had to this my whole life and I've never been able to get rid of the taste. Things that have made it more bearable is drinking it cold, and taking sips of sprite (it is a clear liquid that goes with my conditions and the carbonation and flavor has helped offset the taste). I usually have to take it in large doses and because of the severity of my condition it has been taken with large doses of senokot.",Anonymous

3,GoLYTELY,Constipation Chronic,8,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 22, 2016",23,If you have problems for the taste I would recommend getting some Gatorade and mixing with it instead of the flavor pacet and water. Tastes 10 times better and the electrolytes help.,Anonymous
4,GoLYTELY,Constipation Chronic,10,,"August 15, 2011",47,"I had been constipated for roughly 4 days after quitting drinking this. I foolishly upped my fiber intake by way more than I should have and got myself backed up.I went to the doctor and he prescribed me Go-Lytely, which is a terribly ironic name for such a medicine. I already have passed stools and feel a lot better. The taste is awful though, Its like lemonade made with one lemon, no sugar and salty well water.",Kman90
