0,Valtrex,Varicella-Zoster,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 31, 2019",14,"I started this medication the day after I noticed the rash. It was a small patch on my lower back (maybe 1 1/2 inches). I have luckily had little pain but a couple days the rash was itchy, sore and uncomfortable. After four and 1/2 days on the meds, all of my 10-15 blisters are gone. It doesn’t seem like they even opened... I don’t see any crust. They are thankfully just shrinking and drying up. So so thankful for this med!! (Took med with lots of water and food).",Stacey

2,Valtrex,Varicella-Zoster,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 22, 2013",42,At the age of 61 I had Shingles.  This medication helped with the pain as well as the blisters.  After only 3 or 4 days on Valtrex my blisters began diminishing.  I would estimate somewhere between 40 to 60 percent of the blisters were gone.  It is now day six and I am looking forward to a complete recovery soon.,D Mom
3,Valtrex,Varicella-Zoster,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 21, 2013",42,"I am 54 years old and I suddenly came down with shingles on my right side of shoulder and back. When I took the Valtrex after 30 minutes I felt sudden relief. It didn't take away the pain but in combination with the Percocet I was able to live, not survive. Shingles are very painful and I don't know what I would have done without Valtrex. I would recommend it to anyone suffering from a viral.",JanH1958
