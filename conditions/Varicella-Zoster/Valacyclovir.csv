1,Valacyclovir,Varicella-Zoster,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 4, 2020",3,"I started valacyclovir and I am about 2 days into extreme rash, and though it's taken a while for that to dry out, I am now severely nauseated and unsteady.  I know steroids can do this, so am drinking plenty of water, and going to cut the dose by a third.  The nausea, in particular, is just too much with this drug.  (Maybe smaller adults should take less than all adults?)",AnneB
2,Valacyclovir,Varicella-Zoster,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 24, 2020",10,"I am 25 years old and have Shingles for the first time. On day four of taking this valacyclovir medication. While this has certainly reduced the spread of the shingles to a small rash on my side, I have had very low energy, been very nauseous, had headaches and have lost quite a bit of hair from one of the more rare side effects. I do not feel myself and am on edge and in a fog. Just be heads up for some of these symptoms.",Young Shingle
3,Valacyclovir,Varicella-Zoster,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 31, 2019",14,"Valtrex (valacyclovir):I started this medication the day after I noticed the rash. It was a small patch on my lower back (maybe 1 1/2 inches). I have luckily had little pain but a couple days the rash was itchy, sore and uncomfortable. After four and 1/2 days on the meds, all of my 10-15 blisters are gone. It doesn’t seem like they even opened... I don’t see any crust. They are thankfully just shrinking and drying up. So so thankful for this med!! (Took med with lots of water and food).",Stacey

After the fifth day, I am feeling better, but can't sleep tonight. Blisters are breaking and drying.",Polcat

6,Valacyclovir,Varicella-Zoster,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 22, 2013",42,Valtrex (valacyclovir):At the age of 61 I had Shingles.  This medication helped with the pain as well as the blisters.  After only 3 or 4 days on Valtrex my blisters began diminishing.  I would estimate somewhere between 40 to 60 percent of the blisters were gone.  It is now day six and I am looking forward to a complete recovery soon.,D Mom
7,Valacyclovir,Varicella-Zoster,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 21, 2013",42,"Valtrex (valacyclovir):I am 54 years old and I suddenly came down with shingles on my right side of shoulder and back. When I took the Valtrex after 30 minutes I felt sudden relief. It didn't take away the pain but in combination with the Percocet I was able to live, not survive. Shingles are very painful and I don't know what I would have done without Valtrex. I would recommend it to anyone suffering from a viral.",JanH1958
