0,Fluconazole,Onychomycosis Fingernail,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 12, 2021",1,"I have been taking 300 mg weekly of fluconazole for 6 weeks now, and I'm at the end of my treatment. My fingernails are growing in healthy, about 2/3 complete. I would call this process sometimes difficult but ultimately a success.  My main side effects were a frequently upset stomach, and most bothersome - fatigue and drowsiness.  But I have pushed through the 6 weeks prescribed by my derm, and I see good results.",Desdemona
