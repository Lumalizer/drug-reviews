He looked at it and said it would be gone in few months. I was put on spornox and and it was clear in a month. He kept me on it for a year. I am in my 50's and it's never been back!,Me
1,Itraconazole,Onychomycosis Fingernail,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 1, 2017",12,"Sporanox (itraconazole):I've been taking Sporanox for 10 months now with no improvement.  The fungus is visible in all of my fingernails and all of my toes!  I am nearing the end of my second (6 month) treatment and still no results with this medication.  Fungus has caused several toenails to curl and become ingrown so, very painful.  Doctor won't remove the nails while infected with fungus because nails are too brittle to remove safely without risks of infection.",Prima233911
