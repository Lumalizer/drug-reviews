My 2 big toenails, the tips were yellow and now 8 months later 3 other toes have gone yellow and my thumb has gone yellow too. Will be showing a dermatologist on Monday. For those you have had a fungal infection of the fingernails how to you stop it from spreading to the other fingernails and hands , face , scalp and other parts of the body",Michelle
1,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Fingernail,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 18, 2021",1,"I wrote a review before, giving this 10 stars. Now I'm giving it 5 stars. My first round of terbinafine was for 4 months and my fingernails cleared up and I thought we were good. About 10 months later my fingernails started detaching and my dermatologist said it's the fungus recurring. So we did a second round of terbinafine for 3 months. It has been about 6 months since I completed the second round of terbinafine and my nails look clear but I painted them a few weeks ago and the nails started detaching again. I disinfect all my fingernail utensils before and after use and have gotten rid of any bottles of polish that could have been contaminated. This makes me think the infection just isn't going away completely. It's really bumming me out. It was nice having fingernails again while it lasted :(",Losing hope
2,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Fingernail,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 12, 2020",2,"So my doctor prescribed me this medicine (terbinafine) for 1 month and 2 weeks and it worked like a charm, I was surprised I had no side effect symptoms. I am decently healthy, and so when I first noticed the nail infection I thought my infection would be gone after a while but after almost 1 year of leaving it there it never disappeared.   So I told my doctor about it and started ion the terbinafine and ever since my nail is almost fully grown (needing the white tip of the nail) looking very normal.",John Simmons
3,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Fingernail,10.0,,"April 5, 2020",29,"I've had a fungal fingernail infection for roughly 25 years. It started on my left ring finger, spread to my thumb, then every fingernail on my left hand. I've tried all topical creams, ointments, herbal remedies. Even soaked my nails in half bleach/half water solution daily. The ends of my fingers became deformed. The fingernail detached from the nail bed and fell off. First dermatologist was wrong and said it was eczema. Second dermatologist took a sample of the nail, and showed it was a fungal infection. Prescribed terbinafine (generic lamisil) pill for 4 months. Didn't think it was helping, because I couldn't see a difference until about the 10th week. Brand new normal fingernail started growing in at the cuticle. No negative side effects. It's been 2 months since stopping taking the medication; new healthier nail continues to grow. 3 nails have completely cleared up! I know this is long winded (tldr) but this stuff saved my nails and I'm not self-conscious anymore.",C. W.
4,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Fingernail,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 5, 2020",20,"I am only 2 weeks in - and after being terrified by these reviews - I needed to post.  First of all - based on side effect fears, I am taking a probiotic, biotin and gas-x every day.  Side effects?  A tiny bit gassy - but other then that - none.Results thus far?  I can clearly see that the fungus is dead.  Now I just need to wait for my nails to grow in to the lovely state they were before.",Ro

I have had it for about 2 years now. Since 2017. I might have to start it again and take it for 6 months this time around cuz this pain is bad. I didn’t experience any side effect with this medication and I’m going for my blood work this month to make sure everything is alright with my liver!,Anonymous
6,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Fingernail,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 1, 2019",9,"I spent about 18 months trying all kinds of OTC or natural cures for my 3 fingernails infected with fungus. I didn't go to the doctor because I read the side effects from medication would be so horrible. Then one day I saw the fungus had spread to a 4th nail.  This got me off my butt and I visited my dermatologist. He prescribed terbinafine for 6 weeks, and I determined to just push through the side effects.  Yes, I experienced several,  especially fatigue, gassy stomach, headaches, and metallic taste. But now after 4 weeks, my healthy nails are growing in great and look so nice.  I have 2 more weeks on the pills, and I'm excited to almost be done!  My dermo also prescribed generic Penlac nail lacquer,  which is easy to use, and might add a little strength to the program.",Cindy
7,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Fingernail,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 30, 2019",9,"I have been dealing with sensitive, red and swollen feet for 2 decades. I have spent tens of thousands on Dr.s and misdiagnoses. Not to mention pain to the point of requiring narcotic script to be able to walk on my feet. And I’m an old school outdoors man raised by ww ll vets in the woods of N.E. No whining allowed. I accidentally shone a black light on my feet while examining A/C ducts at home, they were Lime green. I told my doctor this and was prescribed Lamisil for 6 months. 3 months in now, a little irritable, a little depressed, very fatigued. But I can walk without pain. I wish someone figured this out back in 1990’s when it started. Seriously,it’s been a lifesaving drug.",Bub

My left thumb nail still looks like a kettle cooked potato chip. The three other nails are the same too, they were not as bad as the thumb nail to begin with, but still no changes. now what do I do. this stuff is not good for the liver and do NOT want to take it any longer due to no progress in helping me.",Slippy Jones
9,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Fingernail,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 24, 2019",6,"I used terbinafine a few years ago for my toenails. I used it for 3 months and well, it did help the growth and evened them out and all but as far as the actual fungus there is still some there but not as bad. I got another 3 months dose back in June and have taken it all for fingernail fungus. I can't tell it has helped one bit. What a disappointment for even the little price I had to pay for it.I just hope I will see better results by the end of the year.",Ninnie
10,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Fingernail,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 6, 2019",27,"Lamisil (terbinafine):I have had fingernail fungus for about 5 years now. It starter on my  left hand thumb and pointer finger. It has since spread to 6 total fingernails and all my toes. Only my big toes got thick and yellow. I don't believe I had a bad case compared to pics I have seen. I tried Ciclopirox for 8 months on all my toes and fingernails. It definitely helped especially since I ground down 3 fingernails and both big toes. But it got to be such a big pain I decided to try Lamisil. I taken a total of 21 pills in the last 60 days and what a difference!. My fingernails were clearing up after 14 pills. Completely growing back from the base of the nail up. All my small toes are clearer and the big toes too, just not as much. Zero side effects. I should have done this years ago!",Waybad1

It had started to help my finger nail and toe nail but side effects were unbearable and are still bothering me.  I had severe anxiety the day before yesterday, sleep problems for several nights in a row, my joints hurt, the gland on the right side of my neck hurts, I itch. I hope the side effects will go away.  I've called Dr. but he hasn't got back to me.  If I don't feel better over the Labor Day weekend I may go to ER...",Phoebe
13,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Fingernail,1.0,,"August 7, 2018",5,"Started taking the pills as recommended by the doctor about 2 months ago. The first week of taking the didn't really feel any side affects but as time passed I started getting stomach aches and feeling nauseous. After two months of taking them as recommended I had to go to  the emergency room for an anxiety attack which then became discomfort in my chest, hard of breathing, really bad anxiety and cold sweat feeling like a had a fever almost. Also another side affects was the dark urine and diarrhea. After leaving the emergency room they had told me that everything check out there was no issues other then the anxiety I was feeling. Honestly it has gotten my nails better but there more natural ways of taking care of fungal infections on hand snd nail and way better for you. If I would have known that ahead of time I would have never taken this medication in the first place",Marty

I had thick blackened toenails, rough peeling skin, and had tried OTCs and home remedies with little to no effect.Once I started this prescription, I did notice it affected my sense of taste, but continued taking it.  I skipped a month and noticed weeks later that my toenails were almost completely clear. I recently went to get the last refill to ensure my condition doesn't return.

17,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Fingernail,8.0,,"January 2, 2017",13,"I have been taking this medication for a fingernail infection for about 8 months. I had lost about half of each fingernail. By about 4-6 months my fingernails were grown almost down to a normal level on my nail bed and by 8 months I can see almost about 1/3 of the top of the new growth is completely clear with no yellow at all. I'm going to continue to take the medication for at least a few more months (partially because my toes are also infected and they are not quite as far along the recovery path) but I am so thrilled that my finger nails don't look scary anymore and that they will hopefully be fully clear within a few months. The crappy part is insurance will only cover 90 days per every year, so most of the time I'm paying full price.",AMDG123

I spent over half a year trying at home  remedies but nothing worked. I've been taking this medication for about 5 months now and I will tell you this - It doesn't work fast but if you stick with it the nausea and side effects will eventually die down and you will eventually start growing new nail. My two worst nails (my thumbs) are still oddly shaped, but when I look back at the photo I took the first day I realized that the nails were separating from my bail bed, I can see that I've gained back quite a bit after about 5 months. I'm not sure I will ever have my beautiful nails back, but this medication has given me hope that some day (maybe years from now) I will be back to normal.",Nail Polish Lover
19,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Fingernail,8.0,,"May 15, 2016",17,"I took this medication for 90 days and experienced some side effects. The main one was fatigue and slight brain fog. To mitigate this effect I would take it before bed. I also had a dull ache the would come and go near my liver, but my liver test came back fine. Another effect was that it made me slightly more agitated and anxious. I experienced no taste loss as others have experienced though. It seems like new nails are growing in nicely, but it remains to be seen if all of the infected nail will grow out. Best of luck to anyone who gives it a shot.",Ryanman44
20,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Fingernail,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 14, 2016",27,"Lamisil (terbinafine):Not worth the risk! The fungus is definitely clearing up, but I've lost my taste so I'm losing weight (the wrong way) because everything I eat or drink is nasty tasting. I get hungry, but eat a few bites and it tastes like mush. I lose my appetite and stop eating. My skin is itchy, and I have a thick, coated tongue that's sensitive and achy with a constant feeling of something stuck in the back of my throat. Now I read that my taste buds may not ever wake up again! That's going to seriously lower my quality of life! If I'd known these side effects before taking Lamisil, I wouldn't have taken the risk! Using a topical twice a day of tea tree oil, Vick's Vapo Rub, or FungiNail for the rest of my life would be worth it to have my taste back!",BabycakesLori

I went to my doctor and he prescribed me Terbinafine (Lamasil) and I had to take the pills for 42 days which were really gross.

I mistaken said toe but it is nail fungus on my thumb (only one). Now I'm on my last lot  this month, few days to finish. A healthy nail had already grown 80%. I'm hoping the medication to work for a few month after I stop taking it. Now my confidence of using my thumb nail is boosted. I  have been trying different topical creams including tea tree oil. None of them work except this. I am praying to end this medication with no liver damage even thou I'm already a hep B chronic carrier.

24,Terbinafine,Onychomycosis Fingernail,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 5, 2014",14,"I have had, what I think is, a minor case of nail fungus since 2010. I saw a doctor and was given Lamisil pulse therapy with no luck. Later, the biopsy I requested came back clear. One dermatologist said it was a zinc issue after running tests. Still no change in nails after zinc tablets. Another dermatologist said my toes were fine (even though they looked so chalky) but gave me a cream for my pinky fingernail that had white discoloration at the top and a red color from the middle to top of the nail. No improvement. I finally just saw a podiatrist who didn't do a biopsy but assured me it's fungus. One month & I think there's clear nail growth taking over.

Finally, I went to another doctor and she prescribed me Lamisil after running blood tests.My nails have massively improved since early this year. My fingernail which was 90% covered in dead tissue is now only at about 20%, and it actually makes me feel better about myself because it's got so better I don't have to hide my fingers anymore.Before using Lamisil, I've been using Loceryl for about a few months and even now, whilst using Lamisil, I use Loceryl from time to time.Side effect: loss of appetite in last few weeks.

I lived through the embarassment seemingly my whole life, but once my thumbnail became infected to the point where it was practically gone, I had to do anything to treat it.Doctor suggested I take Lamisil, I think he said it has like a 50% chance of working.  I was very nervous after reading reviews, but it also helps that I never drink alcohol. Took it Dec.'11 until March '12, had one liver panel done (normal result). I believe by April my thumbnail was 100% healthy and now (9/12) my toenails are 99% healthy, thank you. Only side effect I noticed wasn't bad, just my farts/stool smelled metallic.

I took the pill at night before bed with 3-4 glasses of water. I drank a LOT of water. Never really had any side effects. After first 30 pills I could tell the fungus was dying. The nail looking healthier. After final 30 pills it was dead. As of today August 30th 2010 there is no trace of the fungus on my nail.
