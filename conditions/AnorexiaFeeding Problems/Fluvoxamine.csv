0,Fluvoxamine,AnorexiaFeeding Problems,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 26, 2020",3,"Of the conditions I was diagnosed with, the most concerning to me was the constant binge eating and purging and incessant thoughts about my appearance, relationships, future, etc.. I have to say after years off and on different medications fluvoxamine is the only one I stuck with other than Prozac, which I took many years ago and stopped sadly. Itâ€™s very important you take this constantly. I take 100mg morning and night. I can say that this medication along with Vyvanse, eating at regular intervals, and my therapist has really helped me. I truly cannot wish my mental state a year ago on my worst enemy. These medications undoubtedly helped me manage so much since then. Try it",Male ED Luvox Exp
1,Fluvoxamine,AnorexiaFeeding Problems,8,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 27, 2019",7,"Started 50mg for restrictive ED, occasional binges, anxiety, obsessions. I had mild nausea and sweating and didn't gain weight. A little less obsessive/anxious. Then went to 100. Headache day one only. Was on it a month and gained a few lbs not bc of increased appetite/meds but I was following my meal plan. Inability to orgasm. Went to 200mg since a lot of crying/somatic symptoms. Depression got worse as did restlessness. I got scared and thought this med may be decreasing symptoms and making others worse so upped to 300. Depression/restlessness almost immediately relieved. Somatic symptoms decreased. On ER had nausea at each release but it's faded. I believe it's causing constipation and night time sweating but thats nothing considering the improvement to quality of life. I've gained what has been appropriate for ED recovery from conscious increased intake. I can still cry with big stressors and feel emotion but the small stuff or for no reason sadness/anxiety and obsessions are gone.",Ji
2,Fluvoxamine,AnorexiaFeeding Problems,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 23, 2015",10,"I switched to fluvoxamine from fluoxetine, for my GAD and anorexia after it was suggested a higher dose was needed and fluvoxamine was a better medication for that. Fluoxetine helped, but fluvoxamine really showed a difference. My mood has improved and stabilised, which has also helped my attitude towards eating. I've managed to get to a healthy BMI now.",Bri .S
