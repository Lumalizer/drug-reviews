0,Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 16, 2022",1,"I first started taking oxcarbazepine as an add-on treatment for bipolar disorder at 300mg/day. It really helped prevent me from snapping during my manic episodes, becoming delusional, and hallucinating. It also helped prevent me from becoming delusional when I hit my extreme lows and became suicidal. I experienced no side effects at the low dose. Now I take 1800mg/day as mono therapy. It has completely stabilized my mood, increased my energy, and reduced my anxiety. At the higher dosage I do experience some adverse side effects; skin irritation and rash, low sodium levels, and decreased appetite. But I feel like these effects are tolerable for the results. I'm finally able to live out a normal life.",Tilted
1,Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 24, 2021",0,"I took it in combination with an antidepressant to stabilize my mood after a type 2 bipolar disorder diagnosis. This medication helped me a lot in the recovery and prevention of relapses towards both hypomanic both depressive episodes, which I feared enormously. I have not reported any side effects, but I recommend you to add it gradually starting from a half tablet in the evening. Another thing I recommend is to take a vitamin D supplement because, like many antiepileptics and mood stabilizers, oxcarbazepine can reduce the amount of vitamin D in your body. With the integration no problem however: my levels were optimal!",Noel Garnet
2,Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 18, 2021",1,This is for my Bi-polar depresson - moderate. I take about 2 or 3 of 300 mg pills of trileptal each evening.  Makes me drowsy.  Helps me to sleep better.  More soundly - don't wake up too much.  Doctor says it helps my bi-polar depression.  For me it helps my sleep and I feel better during the daytime.,Musicman87

This started after college and by the time I was 25, I felt like a guinea pig. Xanax, lithium, Seroquel, depakote, neurontin, celexia, tegretol, Wellbutrin, prozac, Then finally...I got 15 mg of Adderall and 600 mg of Trileptal....totally fine now! Been on for 5 years...got my MBA...and now work for well over 6 figures a year, for one of the most successful companies in the world! It's not bad when used with the right stuff!!!",Ellasgirl
4,Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 11, 2021",0,"I'm bipolar 1 and I've been taking oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) for over 3 years now and absolutely love it.  It worked right away for me and it was a revelation.  My first pdoc insisted on going the anti-psychotics route but they all had really, really nasty side effects.  I'm mostly manic but I take lamotrigine and bupropion for my depression and they both work well together for that.  The mania has been a real challenge to control. Oxcarb was the first one my new pdoc suggested and I immediately felt it working like nothing had before.  I've always been a high-strung, intense person but this drug really smooths me out and helps me truly manage my emotions.  I'm back up to 1200mg x 2 a day for 2400 total which is the max but that's what works best for me.  I have ZERO side effects that I can tell unlike depakote which worked half way but did all kinds of weird things to me.  I actually think all bipolars should start with oxcarb if possible.  It's that good.",B Dogg

6,Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 25, 2021",2,"I began Trileptal just over one year ago. Starting at 300 mg twice a day (first week half then increased to full dose by week 2). After a few months on 300mg 2x daily I changed to 300mg once daily with continued benefits. Benefits include mood  improvement. Accidentally skipping a dose clearly reminds me of the importance of this medication. Without it, I'm irritable, quick to anger, anxious, hurt feelings, cry etc. On it I am more relaxed, mood is improved, helps me 'slow down'-lessen hypo-mania. It eases negative repetitive thinking circles and spirals. I have gained weight and had trouble loosing it which was not a previous issue. However, I can't be sure it's the Trileptal or combo of my meds and life changes. It does cause drowsiness. I take it early evening so getting up in the morning is easier and found a manageable dose with my psychiatrist. Overall it's been greatly beneficial to my mental health and stabilization.",Livingw/Bipolar
7,Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 2, 2021",5,"It took 6 years to diagnose me with bipolar 1, which seems like forever with my family history. I did not hit the Genetic lottery. I inherited it maternally and paternally. I’ve lost loved ones on both mostly because they didn’t take it this serious, which I know  I must not  follow their path .My children deserve better and I don’t want to keep passing this down and this hopelessness and suicide through generations.  It can get better and I believe and pray That it will Stop here. I’ve lost my paternal grands, my own mama, my paternal grandpa,  and my sweet daddy. Enough is enough. Instead of taking their meds, they self medicated with booze, pills, and religion. It doesn’t work you need to take your meds!!!!!! Listen to our doctors! Take ALL  your meds. Ask God for wisdom.

8,Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 8, 2021",4,"I was on only 150mg of oxcarbazepine for 6 weeks as a treatment for BPD and bipolar disorder. I cannot suggest enough against using this awful medication. 2 weeks after I began my treatment I developed migraine headaches daily from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to sleep. These headaches could not be stopped by any pain medication. I began to worry that something was wrong and visited my local urgent care to get bloodwork. As it turns out, oxcarbazepine made me severely anemic. I have never had anemia in my life and because of this drug I am now suffering with extreme hair loss as a result of the anemia that it caused. I am constantly fatigued and have daily headaches still after stopping the medication. Never again. Beware. Oh, and also I am under the age of 25.",bp666
9,Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 26, 2021",3,"Oxcarbazepine isn’t the best anti-manic mood stabilizer (I take an antipsychotic adjunct for that) but it has the best antidepressive effect out of all the medications I’ve tried, and I’ve tried a lot! The only side effect was dry mouth with each dose increase that eventually went away.",drugreviewer6
10,Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,,"April 28, 2021",4,"I'd been on and off medications for 3 years before my psychiatrist prescribed me a dose of 1200mg a day. Nothing had been working up until that point, but this med changed my life. The first year I was on it I was very stable, which has diminished over time but I'm not in the place I used to be. I never dealt with any side effects of this med, but the score I put is because of the horrific sensations I get when I miss a single dose. Full body tingles, disorientation, extreme head fog, tremors in my hands. Once I accidentally missed two doses and couldn't get out of bed because the tingling sensation was so bad, and I felt like something was crushing my chest. If I miss a single dose I'm essentially out of commission for an entire day. And lastly, you absolutely cannot mix this medication with any hard liquor. I did once, and without ingesting more than half of a mixed drink I began to experience extreme and frightening vertigo. Wine and beer are fine, but nothing else.",:)

Yes you do get drowsy with every dosage increase, but you will adjust, and after you do, I promise the sleepiness will disappear and you will not lose your creativity. You’ll collect all your thoughts to follow through with all your many creative things you do as a bipolar. I was recently hospitalized, and the doctor increased nightly dose to 900mg and morning dose to 600mg. I was worried about being so medicated. Started out sleeping all night and day, but within a week had adjusted and felt great. I began baking cakes again, finished alterations that needed doing before this Easter, started more gardening, added more to my workout regimen. I can’t believe so many people l here can’t manage mixed bipolar with this wonderful drug. I was so depressed. Now I’m so much better.

His 1st diagnose is Autism, social anxiety, learning disability, non-verbal, and now bipolar due to aggressive outburst behaviors. He is taking 150 mg of oxcarbazepine. When he was taking 300 mg with 3 mg of Tenex he was completely lethargic and couldn't get up from bed. Now, at 150 mg and .5 mg of Tenex he is functioning again. He is not aggressive, but he cannot stop eating. He is always dizzy and the mornings and is very anxious.

13,Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 15, 2021",5,"I have been battling severe mixed states for over a decade with my bipolar II diagnosis. I started a low dose of oxcarbazepine about three weeks ago and while it does help your brain more or less ""relax"" it also strips it of any creativity or motivation. I have been sleeping better but feel like I am in a constant haze. I will have therapy sessions or doctors visits and not remember any points from the conversation. For this drug to be considered mild compared to other meds seems inconceivable to me. I think this medication would be helpful for those in manic episodes but because I am battling severe depression I do not think its going to be a long term solution as it strips me of wanting to do what little hobbies I enjoy doing anymore. Also, my skin is a nightmare. I prayed the listed acne side effect would not select me as a victim but it indeed did. I am breaking out like an 8th grader in puberty.",Kate

It's decreased my ruminating thoughts tenfold, and helped with the anxiety that accompanied that. Looking forward to increasing my dose in the next few days.  I can't say enough good things about this drug for unwanted rumination. Finally feeling clear headed again for the most part, and assured I will be even better with the increase.

15,Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 30, 2020",34,I was diagnosed bipolar in my early twenties. I have been on numerous medications for bipolar but none of them quite did it for me. I quit treating my mental illness with medication out of frustration and anger. My life took a detour through the darkest shades of life I’ve ever seen. Now in my mid forties I’ve come to terms that I can’t leave my bipolar in limbo. So I sought help and my doctor put me on Triliptal and I truly feel like life’s finally going to be filled with joy and sunshine again. Best wishes...,Dave1975
16,Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 4, 2020",90,"Was diagnosed with bipolar type 1, OCD and a some ADHD. The first two doses was half a tablet. The second day I took half a dose, I felt normal for the first time in my life. I wanted to cry. Then I took 1 full dose for the next two days and I felt even better. The 5 day was 1.5 tablet and it made me super duper tired and sleepy (thank God I wasn’t working). So I went back down to one tablet. Ever since I stuck with that tablet, my racing thoughts and the impulsiveness improved A LOT! I feel more focused. I actually think before I act. I don’t really care what people think about me as much. People told me I am more calm and honestly. God bless the people who made this drug. I did have an increase hunger but I controlled it and it doesn’t affect me anymore. I can't wait to go to my follow up with my doctor and tell her about my improvements!",Kim

I was rapid cycling due to an antidepressant but the trileptal was very effective for stopping the cycle.   My mind wasn’t going a million miles an hour anymore.   However horrible dangerous side effects starting with dizzy and nausea.  At 8 months hives on my skin.  Rash on my palms and it was in my mouth.  Scratchy throat and respiratory problems also. Stopped cold turkey and now I’m cycling into depression,Sinrn

So far is been positive mentally & I'm much more balanced.  Physically I'm on the lowest dose but instead of my usual reflux I'm getting more nausea.  Also strangely my knees are more limber but my back is so stiff that it makes noise (snap, crackle, pop) when I squat.  My thirst has increased slightly and I find that I cry more but I feel less depressed.  The anxiety level I have is way down but now tends to revolve around thoughts of covid effects on society or the severe side effects that could pop up, I know this isn't likely to be the right dose but I'm nervous about taking the dose higher",Hmmm
19,Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 1, 2020",17,"This medication Triletal  has made my moods extremely stable in a short time.  It also is helping with my anxiety, PTSD and acne (dries the skin).  So glad that I switched from Lamictal.  However I'm extremely frightened by the blood disorders this medication sometimes causes (loss of red blood cells,  immune cells and/or platelets).  But on balance seems safer with less risk of skin rashes/encephalitis than Lamictal.  Won't assign a number value but wanted to offer a bipolar review as none here yet & will update with further feedback later.

But I found I would get into this weird drowsy high state, i couldnt walk and felt so out of it. We switched to 300mg 4x and it works perfectly, occasionally I'll get the high feeling but a nap takes it right out or just wait 15-20 minutes.

31,Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 10, 2019",68,"Look, this  oxcarbazepine medication will definitely make your mood stable. Do not freak out at the starting side effects of dizziness and problems with coordination. After a while your body will acclimate to the drug. Give it more than 6 weeks for your body side effects to settle and get used to it. I consider myself a bright person - it WILL slow down your thought processing. It will make you feel dull and it WILL come with emotional flatness. I have always acted on impulse and I like not feeling as emotional. The slowness sucks... but it definitely out weighs the horrible mood swings I'd have in ONE day. In the morning, I'd be depressed and hate life and by afternoon, overly manic (which is euphoric) and loving life. I cannot bring this mentality into the work place and relationships... Try it.

Since starting Trileptal, I’ve been needing a full three meals, plus snacks with how ravenous my appetite has become.

I was started at a 1500mg daily dose and I think that is way too high for me.  I have been at this dose for over three months and the doctors seem to think that the side effects are outweighed by the positives.  I have felt more depressed since they put me on this but they don%u2019t worry about that it. I would rather have the antidepressants back at least, I could be a human with them.",VAbaby

Not sure why that is and I'm wondering if I might need to up either one of these drugs. I'm thinking it's a good medicine for mood but uncertain of the dosage I should be on.",Dawnabelle

I don't have the depression part like most do. I absolutely love Trileptal. For the 3 years before that I had tried a handful from Lamictal, Topamax and Wellbutrin. They all resulted in violent outbursts. For about 2 years I took 1mg Abilify along with it, it worked okaay but I would still get very annoyed with everything. So it then got paired up with Geodon and it's worked wonders for me! It may have taken 5 years to get it just right but when its right you will know!",Anonymous

After 6 months on oxcarbazepine minimum dosage I stopped drinking.  Had to increase dosage to 900 mg/day (I'm one who really doesn't like having to take medicines). I've been clean/sober for 18 months and tried to get off both medicines mentioned in a week.  Nearly relapsed so went back to former dosages.  Doctor suggested reducing dosage of bupropion over a year.  I decided to stay on full dosage unless I lose my job/insurance.  No more suicidal thoughts or that feeling like my brain is going down a dirt road.  I'm not sure I'd label myself bipolar, but this does seem to help, a lot.",Anonymous
