0,Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 21, 2022",0,"I've been on 5mg of the generic version of Abilify for a few years now. I'm a 44 year old woman with ADHD & Bipolar Type 2. It's been such a lifeline for me. I'm also on the generic versions of Adderall (2.5 pills daily, 20mg) & Topamax (a mood stabilizer; 50mg mornings, 100mg at night) as well. I can't take antidepressants (SSRIs and SNRIs for example among others) all increases my suicidal thoughts. On a low daily dose of Abilify for 3 years now, originally for treatment resistant depression, the frequency of my suicidal ideations has drastically dropped. I was only Dx'd as Bipolar Type 2 just six months ago (in Sept of 2021) and then started on Topamax. I've never experienced a manic episode, but my depressive episodes last months to years at a time—with my ADHD masking it in social situations. Hypomania I have maybe 1-3 days at a time, 1-2x/month. It feels like you had a good day at work regardless of what's going on in your life (even if someone close just died).",TPC

No side effects to report other than possible weight gain. I didn't feel that this medicine was helping in any way until I got off it for a month to try and see if the weight would come off. I fell into a major depressive bout for 4 days straight. As soon as I got back on it I felt much better, my depression lifted. Doesn't seem to anything to noticeable for me but in combo with my antidepressant it seems to keep me from going to far down and less often.",JC77

4,Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 27, 2021",3,"Abilify was the cause of the worst year of my life. Massive depression and constantly comatose. I was like a zombie. I woke up in the morning thinking when do I get to go back to sleep. Suicidal thoughts were frequent.  My wife would frequently comment on how I wasn’t myself, how I didn’t talk anymore. I was a shell. I also gained 20lbs (I’m a skinny guy with a high metabolism). When I finally detoxed from the drug, I had energy again. My weight gain is now mostly gone and I engage with my family and am more present. Abilify was the worst thing I have ever done to myself.",Anonymous
5,Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 27, 2021",3,"Instead of helping my depression, I felt trapped in it, unable to say how I truly felt. Unable to move out of that feeling, yet unable to fully feel it either. My irritability became worse overall. I would have even bigger breakdowns over even smaller things. The frequency was slightly less, the incidents were more severe. I developed tardive dyskinsia, and pseudo parkinsons after long term use. I gained over 100 lbs on this medication, 60 of which happened in the first 5 months. My dietary habits did not change in this time. My sleep and exercise was effected. Previous to abilify, I was very active and loved to walk and ride my bike. While on abilify, I became listless and disinterested in physical activities. My poor sleep became worse, and abilify created insomnia in me, which I then needed more medications for. The I began having memory and attention issues while on abilify, so I was prescribed adderall to help me concentrate. All of this, and I am better off meds.",Rachel

7,Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 17, 2021",2,"Abilify destroyed my mental state. I was prescribed Abilify during a hypomanic phase. In the first two weeks of taking it hypomania left but depression started. My doctor suggested to up the dose, it made the depression worse. I upped the dose once more. I have been experiencing depression times for many years. The depression I got from Abilify 15 mg is like nothing I have ever felt before. Worst 6 months of my life. Near the ends, every time I would take it, I was thinking that I am literally poisoning myself. I got off it late April. The change in my mood was immediate. At the same time I started taking lamotrigine (miracle - 50mg to start). I finally understood what normal feels like. Abilify gave me a 6-month nightmare. I know for some people it might work wonders but for me I would even prefer to go untreated instead of using this drug ever again",Disabilify

I'm glad it works wonders on a lot of people but not for me. Two weeks in I had involuntary muscle twitches, dyskinesia, and restless leg as well as muscle discomfort. I also experienced worsened tics from taking Abilify 10mg. Doctor put me on Latuda instead and that has been working wonders. He told me normally Latuda is a much better bet than Abilify as far as lesser side effects goes. For the bipolar itself, this drug worked, but the side effects outweighed the benefits.",Jay
9,Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 2, 2021",3,"I’m reading the reviews and I find it really interesting. Honestly, Abilify did nothing for me. like I never even felt any sort of effects, and it was almost like a sugar pill for me. It was actually crazy, I’m so used to medication is knocking me off my feet so when I felt nothing different from this medication I was confused. Eventually, my psychiatrist said that he didn’t want me on prescription medications. He told me to wean off of them, but instead of weaning off I decided to stop cold turkey. I had absolutely no withdrawal symptoms, and felt the exact same as I did when I took the medication. Am I the only one that just didn’t get anything out of this medication?",Clove
10,Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 2, 2021",0,"Been on 2mg of Abilify for exactly one month now — the first week I was sluggish and very nauseated, but almost instantly I started to notice a HUGE difference when it comes to depression, anxiety, and irritability (I have depression, anxiety, OCD, an eating disorder in remission, panic disorder, and BP1). I have felt a bit more manic than usual, but I was also just diagnosed with BP disorder about 2 months ago so I think I am more aware of it. The lack of severe depression and irritability has sincerely changed my life — even friends & family have noticed. I am so grateful for my positive experience so far, but I do hope that with medication and therapy the mania begins to subside eventually to a point where I can control it.",Kam

They put me on Abilify 2mg. It’s been a week and I already feel a positive difference. I am diagnosed with Bipolar type 2 with borderline traits, PTSD, and autism.

I just finished organizing and cleaning out my car that had things in it from 8 months ago. It’s 3 pm and I don’t feel like sleeping for 6 hours then sleeping all night again until 12 pm the next day. I went out to eat with a friend and felt zero annoyance.

15,Abilify,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 23, 2021",1,Wonderful to fight depression and emotional hunger. Suicidal and majorly depressed for 30 years. Lithium eliminated the suicidal thinking but still little energy. Give the side effects a chance to wear off. 1st 5 days only 8 hours of sleep total on 2.5 mg. Now I take 5 mg and I sleep 8 to 10 hours a night with very little interruption. Much more energy and motivation during the day. Not missing 30 hours of work every 2 weeks anymore only about 4 hours.

Vivid dreams? Of course. But it got rid of my insomnia, racing thoughts, mood swings, any mental health problem I had, gone. The only issue I had of it was on the first night and I was a little agitated once your chemical imbalance starts to adjust, things go along smoother.

Having been sober from alcohol for over six years, this battle has truly tested my patience - day after day. That is until recently. I am currently on 5mg of Trintillex (I have weaned down from 20mg and will eventually be off because of Abilify), 250 mg of Depakote (weaned down from 350 mg) and only 2.5 mg of Abilify.

After the first episode, I was put on zyprexa in which I felt zombified and depressed on which led me to go off of it entirely. Less than a year later I was hospitalized again and at that point I was introduced to Abilify. Three years passed during which I was stable. I then went off of it which led to my third and final hospitalization. Ever since then I took the 20mg tablets religiously and would soon combine it with Lamictal. This combo has worked wonders for me. Years ago a doctor told me that I’m on the Rolls Royce of bipolar medication and I firmly agree.

My anxiety came back worse than before on this med and the restlessness was too much for me. I took 5mg and I would get an hour or two of sleep per day and not be able to sit still during the day. I will say that it cured my depression completely, so for that I am grateful. As far as my anxiety, sleep, and overall mood it has not improved. Moving up in dosage caused more restlessness and moving down to 2.5mg or less made me tired and didn't do much for my mood. This med didn't work for me but its not the worst med, give it a shot.

Well the pharmacy was out of stock of Latuda and I had just finished my taper off of Abilify,  so I was about 4-5 days off of any mood stabilizer.

Since the second week of my taper (down to 5 mg, then 2) I applied for some more credit cards and thought nothing of it.  In the past 2 days, I have maxed out all those credit cards.

I couldn't eat and often felt sick because of how anxious I was.  So yes, Abilify did benefit me alongside this weird side effect.

I was then lowered the dosage to 5mg, however is still make me tired and increased of anxiety. My physician does not want to take me off of it. I really do not wish to proceed with this medication.

Plus when I'm off meds I tend to drink to keep my mind under control-thats a bad thing since I have gastritis.  I had been off it for about two weeks and drank last night and was up half the night with my stomach.  I'm not an alcoholic, have discussed my drinking habits with the doctor, they are not concerned.  But I have started my meds today again because of my stomach.  I love being unmedicated, but this helps me control my thoughts and I don't tend to get out of control on it.  So yes, works 10/10 for me.

However, even at its highest dose, it wasn’t strong enough or potent enough for me I suppose - it just didn’t match up. I continued to have some paranoia and whenever I was more upset than usual, I’d have breakthrough hallucinations. What made the docs take me off of it was the oral twitching I developed and bizarre tongue movements, which are signs of tardive dyskinesia, a rare side effect. Newer antipsychotics have less instances of this condition, but it’s still possible. Anyway, I was taken off of it and placed on another antipsychotic.

With risperidone I had no ""lid"" to my hunger. It was endless, and that was quite disappointing. There were many other side effects, but the weight gain has added to my self loathing. Though the painful heart dysrhythmias are a close second. I'm hoping that Abilify makes it possible for me to curb my appetite back to what it used to be as I exercise the 30 pounds I don't need away.",Nocture_Melody
