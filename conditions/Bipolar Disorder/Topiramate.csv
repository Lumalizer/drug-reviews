0,Topiramate,Bipolar Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 4, 2022",1,I was only on topamax for a month or so. My doctor started me on 25 mg for 2 weeks then jumped to 50. Everything was good and I was happy until it hit me that I was manic the whole time I was on it. Like bad. The energy was great though so I miss that but the mania was not healthy. I spent so much money on stupid things and I randomly took every single photo off of my walls. It was weird. I’ve never been manic before.,Misfit
1,Topiramate,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 17, 2022",2,"I wasn’t given topamax for bipolar disorder but for migraines, but it made a major positive impact on my moods. I treated it a year ago and the side effects were so intense I honestly couldn’t handle the medicine & ultimately stopped it. I recently began taking it again due to bad migraines again and when I got the medicine filled it had a note on it saying that the look some ingredients have changed but it’ll have the same effect as it did before… it seems to work so much better with hardly any side effects at all. Weight loss is a side effect but a very welcomed one as I am overweight and a bad binge eater. It’s helped my moods improve a lot since I started it. One thing I will say is to take or drink magnesium and potassium supplements/drinks to lessen side effects and you’ll be fine. I've been on the medicine 3 weeks, almost 4, and the migraines have calmed down a lot already.",My experience
2,Topiramate,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 15, 2021",1,"Hey friends! Julie here, 35 YO personal trainer & mom of a 4 YO boy named Lawrence. I was given topamax for migraine prevention…a few days after starting the medication I was unexpectedly diagnosed with bipolar 2 depression.   After doing some research I found out that topamax  is used for both diagnosis’.   Tricky part is I have a pituitary adenoma which can mimic bipolar II symptoms. DOCTOR RECOMMENDATIONS NEEDED After reading every review I was not given the correct starting dose. I started at 50 mg and a week later increased to 100 mg.  Since increasing:soda tastes flat & horrible, 4 days of continuous migraines, disgustingly dry mouth, Food? What’s that?, I cannot hold a conversation, I am SO tired. On the positive side,  I feel balanced for the first time in my life, no ups and downs, I am out of bed, did not spend my entire pay check in one day lol and there are more positives but can’t recall them (side effect lol) Please recommend docs!!!!",juliemil
3,Topiramate,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 28, 2021",1,"I have never been so glad to read bad reviews in my life! I thought it was just me. My psychiatrist just kind of prescribed Topiramate on a whim. I don't normally question him. He mentioned no side effects. But he never does. So, 200mg daily for 8 months. I've wondered why I had less than no energy, sudden problems with bladder infections, hair loss, can't spell, can't remember yesterday, can't concentrate. It didn't help my moods either. I had just accepted the fact that it was me at 61. Now I  know differently. It just took 12 hours of research to find out. It was worth it. I'm very upset with my psychiatrist of 12 years. Don't take this medicine if you have an alternative.",anonymous
4,Topiramate,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2021",1,"I started taking a very low dose of topiramate and started having awful, disturbing nightmares every night. I was also vaguely drowsy and confused all the time, which was interfering with work - I sometimes appeared slightly stupid when interviewing people. When the dosage was increased, I started having pain in my eyes, a bad headache and nausea. It was the weekend, so I couldn't reach my psychiatrist. I called the pharmacist and he told me to go to the hospital right away because this was a side effect that could make me PERMANENTLY BLIND if not addressed quickly. Needless to say this was a traumatic experience and I would not recommend taking this drug.",Discouraged

I am hoping that it will help me to lose the weight that I gained while on Seroquel.  I am still taking Seroquel though so I don't know if it will work.  I am also using it as a mood stabilizer.  I have a mood disorder, anxiety and depression.  It is day 5 and I already notice that my anxiety is better and my moods are more stabile.  I have not noticed any weight loss yet.  I will be upping my dose to 50mg this Monday after meeting with my doctor.  The only side effects that I have had is that I feel very tired which has resulted in be finally being able to enjoy a cup of coffee.  My anxiety had been so bad that I had to cut all caffeine from my diet.  I noticed heartburn the passed few days which is pretty uncomfortable so I took an acid reducer.  So many people talk about soda tasting different.  I had a Coke zero yesterday as an experiment.  It tasted flat.  I hope to lose weight and not to lose my hair on this med.",chickennugget0316
6,Topiramate,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,,"June 5, 2021",9,"After working my way through approximately 7-10 different medications over a 3.5 year period, Topiramate was a game changer for my OCD (skin picking)- Holy Hana! I realize now I've just been bandaiding my OCD and skin picking to this point. Unlike the many SSRIs I've tried, Topiramate starts working immediately. I'm taking 100 mg and I'm fortunate that I do not experience any of the memory issues. I am calm, free of anxiety, and I genuinely wake up happy every day and love my family (every single member :) I no longer have days where I feel foggy, fuzzy, and dazed. I'm sharp, clear and full of life. My only regret is that it took me so long to find this med.  As for weight loss, I didn't really have any to lose (that hasn't been a focus) and so I'm happy to report I've only lost 5lbs and hopefully no more otherwise that will become an issue.",Jilly Juice
7,Topiramate,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 16, 2021",1,"This medication paired with sertraline derailed my life. I was so sick I was forced to take leave from work. At the five week period of the medication my blood work came back with critical levels in 7 results.I wound up in the ER and was diagnosed with Neutropenia. At this point I’m now on my fourth week off work, isolated from family and my levels are slowly returning to normal (fingers crossed).Be careful and get your blood checked regularly. I was at 0.2 neutrophils, 136 blood platelets and 2.0 WBC, I also had mild cytosis and irregular smears.All in all I was better off rapid cycling on my other medication or not even on medication.I pray my body isn’t permanently damaged.

Not complaining!! I’m a little irritable, okay a lot. Hopefully that will go away. Hands and face are tingling which I can deal with. The only thing I really HATE is I can’t sleep! Even with Remeron and seroquel together at night I’m still waking up all night and waking up stupid early. Probably why I’m so grouchy. Gonna give it 6 more weeks and if the sleep thing doesn’t change I’ll have to switch meds once again. Good luck to you all!!",Mag

I take 100mg a day 50mg in the morning and 50mg at night.  I take it for bipolar rapid cycling.  I am 5'8 male who weighed 200 lbs.  I have lost 20lbs over 4 weeks with exercise and the fact that topamax makes it real easy to not eat as much.  I don't binge like I used to because I gained so much weight on zyprexa.  I was able to cut back on my dose of zyprexa significantly due to the mood stabilizing qualities of topamax.  Initially I had some depression starting the topamax but it subsided after a couple days and I feel amazing.  This has helped my mood, my weight, my self confidence, and we'll being and my quality of life. I give topamax a ten out of ten.  I recommend exercise to prevent the feet and hand tingles ",GOLDCT

17,Topiramate,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,,"October 10, 2019",50,I have taken topamax 200mg 2x daily since 2006. I tried several meds for rapid cycling bipolar and side effects were awful. My experience is topamax works great for bipolar.  I will not change. You must not vary. If I miss or forget I feel immediately sensitive and emotional and will be prone to depressive behavior or worse manic with depressive moods and all over the place. For myself the side effects improved over time ..after you make it through the  tingling toes and fingers in the first month. And also  that brain fog and searching for the right word. I've learned how to stimulate my brain and not feel like I'm always reaching for an adjective I used to know. For me..my body adjusted. And it is so worth it compared to other drugs side effects like muscle jerking or gaining 40 lbs or being a zombie and feeling nothing. My first episode is something I never want to happen again. I will never switch to another med  13 years on it  and I'm great. My therapist says I'm the highest functioning bipolar patient she has ever met!,Kylee

I've been on SO many different antipsychotics that never helped with anything but weight gain. FINALLY, I'm on a great medication - Topiramate that has stabilized me!! I've only been taking it about 4 months but so far it's the best med for me.

I no longer have that side effect and the medication is beginning to give me a sense of well being. I also get migraines so it's good for that too. Many bipolar meds can give migraines.,Aleigh

My GP weaned me off it in both pregnancies during the 1st month after I found out I was pregnant.I was concerned about side effects of coming off it, but I didn't any.After both my babies were born I suffered with post-natal depression and went  straight back onto it, meaning I was unable to breastfeed, but I knew I had to feel well to be a Mum.20 years on I still take Topamax, its my life line, without it, or if I take it a couple of hours late I'll get a headache.

29,Topiramate,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,,"October 18, 2018",11,"I’ve used this medication two separate times for different reasons. The first was for a mood stabilizer.

I ended up cutting my very long hair off to way above my shoulders with layers. It took 3 years to grow out. I’m still pissed.This most recent usage and more traumatic experience was when I added it to my daily meds for migraines. I took 25 mg of topamax for a week then 50 mg a day for 5 days. I stopped completely after having suicidal thoughts. I should have been more prompt to end the medication bc when I started it I noticed I was more alert and my heartbeat was more pronounced, but I really wanted it to work so I thought I just needed to get used to it. 3days after stopping the medication I checked myself in to the psych ward.

30,Topiramate,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 26, 2018",24,I’m currently on Topamax 600mg/day for anxiety/OCD. I’ve been on this for many years for OCD as an off-label use and along with cognitive-behaviour therapy it’s a life changer. (Note: everyone is different and my friend who took this for anxiety had a side effect of extreme anger. I don’t have that whatsoever.) I do have the tingling but it goes away and when I get it I know it’s just the medication and it’ll subside. The big thing for me is memory loss. I work in film so instructions and continuity are important and it’s difficult to share with people that you’re on a medication that affects that without worrying about your career. Another thing is withdrawal. Always remember to renew your prescription ahead of time. This is important for anxiety because for me after day two of not having it I feel like I can’t leave the house. I’m glad my psychiatrist tried this on me. No sexual or weight gain side effects like SSRIs or SNRIs and for me it’s way more effective.,PolydactylKat

I suffered severe weight loss and lack of appetite- I went from a healthy size 10 to 48 kg and was almost size zero. After discontinuing topirimate I began having bulimia symptoms and am sure I would have starved to death if I wasn't taken off it. It did not help my depression or other bipolar symptoms. It made me not able to empty my bladder properly resulting in kidney stones and severe urine infection.I would urge anyone considering taking this drug to do your research into physically devastating side effects carefully  and only do so with regular monitoring by a psychiatrist and not for it to be left to GP to monitor.,Rted

It also helps with mild psychotic episodes during mania for me. (Voices, hearing noises that aren't there) There is a slight tapering of appetite for me that stabilizes after prolonged use. I also have to search for common words sometimes. Pins and needles in my hands and feet, especially when I'm driving or it's really cold outside.
