0,Risperdal,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 11, 2022",0,"rispirdal is a life saver. I take it for Existential ocd, Depersonalization/Derealization and bipolar depression, along with Venlax 75 and 100mg lamictal in the morning. It is a life savior. My mood is better. I don't have mood swings. I don't have intrusive thoughts about reality anymore. Also, intrusive thoughts don't control me any more! Also, I am not dissociated anymore. It helps me to be attached to reality. The first week was like a hell. But after it, I started getting better. Give it a try and wait until it works!",Dani
1,Risperdal,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 2, 2022",2,"I’ve been taking Risperdal for 10+ years. I got diagnosed bipolar after 9 years. Before that, doctors were unable to give me a diagnosis because my symptoms are atypical. I suffered from psychosis and emotional instability. I was given a dose of 6mg in the beginning and it stopped the paranoia. I had a lot of side effects like sleepiness, flat affects, lactation, anorgasmia, weight gain, blurry vision, greasy skin, greasy hair. My dose went down to 2mg and it stopped the side effects, but I was still emotionally unstable, however no delusions. After 9 years I received lamictal and I felt a lot better, the depressions stopped, however I started having psychoses again and the Risperdal went to 3mg, then 4mg. I’m trying another antipsychotic now because of the weight gain. Over the years I gained 40lbs, especially when my dose went up.",Anonymous
2,Risperdal,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,,"February 10, 2021",6,"Terrible choice by my PA to put me on this stuff. I was only on .25mg and the first day I was on it I had to leave work early because I was so confused, felt drained, exhausted. Sleep was absolutely horrible. Couldn’t stay asleep. It only got worse as the first full week I was on it I had zero focus, energy, felt confused at work. I missed the better part of two days of going to work. Went that same Friday and my PA took me off of it and put me back on a lower dose of Latuda and I’ve never felt better.",rustynail23

She hears voices and see things when having her manic attacks. Five days ago, they begun giving her this medicine. I’m reading everything people have said here and  I’m wondering if this medicine is all she may need to live a happy healthy life. She has tried zyprexia many years ago and that helped for a time. I’m keeping hope alive!",Rose
4,Risperdal,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 8, 2020",9,I haven't experienced serious side effects only blurred vision and drowsiness.

5,Risperdal,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 25, 2020",68,Yesterday I requested an emergency call  from my Psychiatrist and she called this pill in because I was in a severe manic episode.  I didn’t think it would work. Nothing has. Then the insurance didn’t pay for it. I was ready to go to a psych hospital at this point.  Luckily I had a little bit of money and the pharmacy let me partially fill it because the effects are amazing. Literally stopped my manic episode dead in its tracks and two hours later I was feeling amazing! Like I said I was in such a bad manic episode and I have extreme anxiety too so I was literally ready to admit myself into a hospital and just give up on life altogether.But I’m self employed and own a business and I’m moving next week so I really didn’t want to wind up in a hospital or worse in jail for doing something crazy!This drug may have just saved my life altogether!,Lowell123123
6,Risperdal,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,,"June 12, 2020",50,"Hello, my name is James and I have Bipolar type 1 disorder. I take 1200mg of lithium, 1mg of  Risperdal, and 25mg of Quetiapine. When I initially started the Risperdal, it fired me up with the same effects that I’ve experienced on previous occasions with antidepressants.  It also began to mess with my sleeping pattern. For example, I would constantly be waking up two hours before my scheduled time. The good news, however, is that these side effects which I endured were short-lived, and after 3 weeks, they settled down. Any issues that I had previously encountered with regards to psychotic features :  Hearing voices and talking to myself excessively, impulsivity, and anxiety all seemed to vanish from the face of my earth.",James
7,Risperdal,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 14, 2020",39,"I've tried a lot of different meds, my favorite by far is Lamictal but it stopped working after 10 years. I started risperidone a year ago. It makes me calm, I hardly get angry, I have no anxiety, and I have not had an episode since I started it. I feel great on it in general. The down side -- It makes me lazy, I'm so chill now that I'm totally comfortable just sitting on the couch. I feel relaxed and balanced but without the anxiety I have no reason to get up and ""run it off"". The biggest and worst issue I have with it is the damn weight gain. I've always been super fit and thin but now I have a belly that I just can't get rid of. If the it didn't work so well for my mood I would get off of it immediately to lose my weight. I would still recommend it and I won't be stopping it anytime soon.",gatinha
8,Risperdal,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 21, 2019",43,"Risperdal saved my life. I was hospitalized two times with psychosis and this is what they gave me. It took a few weeks to really kick in. At first I was tired. I have been on the med for almost five years now. I am able to live a normal life although I still have some depression. I take 4mg risperdal which I just increased from 3mg because at times I would have mild hallucinations or delusions when tired or the like. They are almost non existent now, really just coming on if I have caffeine. I did gain weight but not meaningfully so. The trick is to watch your calories and exercise as much as possible. I would recommend trying this for severe psychosis. I also take 600mg lithium which seems to help my mood. I like to think that the lithium helps the brain from the damage risperdal can cause. Without risperdal I wouldn't be here by now. Everyday is a blessing and a gift!",James

11,Risperdal,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 16, 2019",38,"Risperdal was the first medication I ever tried for my bipolar type one and it was awful. They started me out on 8mg which is unusually high, it kept me from being manic or depressed but also completely stopped me from being able to feel any emotion. I was a zombie. I honestly felt like if my best friend died I'd feel absolutely nothing, it was that bad. Would not recommend, my current psychiatrist also says she hates Risperdal if that helps any.",LS

Since I changed I find that I sing a lot and my mood is sometimes loony sometimes doesn't want to deal with people.  I gained so much weight on both celexa and risperdal around 40lbs.

I gain 40lbs I feel unmotivated all the time I feel sedated, it is not me anymore. I am a perfectionist and risperdal is definitely the deadliest medication ever for me.

My psychiatrist helped wean me off it (It is not addictive it just causes withdrawal symptoms) and even before I was completely off it I had lost 15 lbs. I am now 40 pounds lighter and its been about two months. My friends and family say my emotions are much more ""colorful"" and I seem more emotionally engaged.

15,Risperdal,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,,"June 8, 2019",30,"Have been taking Risperodal for almost a year now. I tried Seroquel before for some months but it made me super drowsy throughout the day and I couldn’t function. I take Risperdal for severe depression, mania, and extreme hallucinations. I would see cartoons and things appear before me, hear voices/sounds in my ears, or feel things on me for (someone patting my back or grabbing my legs when I’m alone in the room). I started off taking 0.5 mg once a day then upped it to 1mg. Was on 1mg for a while. It worked well for me. I stopped seeing hallucinations and for the most part my mania and depression and lessened or gone away. I woke up every day feeling refreshed. Even my period cramps were usually less painful than before. Everything would go downhill when I decided to stop the medication, all the symptoms would come back quickly and badly. Didn’t gain significant weight from the meds and I’ve had moderate acne. Seems like it’s going to be really hard to leave this medication.",Jello

17,Risperdal,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 26, 2019",21,"After some months on Risperdal, I developed swallowing problems, which led to anxiety.  Lowering dose  improved but did not eliminate the problem.  Later I noticed that I was very tense all the time.  I would notice it and make myself relax and then in a few seconds I realized I was all tensed up again.  I developed frozen muscles in my forehead.  It felt like they had very little feeling..I don't know what you call it but I saw it was listed as a side effect once I looked it up.  It went away when I stopped the med.  When I stopped this medication, I discovered I had a problem with my tongue.  It is like it's too thick or something and doesn't form words as well, so I have a very mild speech impediment now.  It is more difficult to speak and I have to be very deliberate in speaking in order to speak clearly and without a lisp.",Shereen
18,Risperdal,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 4, 2019",14,"Overall, I really like risperdal. It's easy to take with minimal side effects. I take the generic version for Bipolar 2 and have been trying over 30 meds for 5 years. I used to take Seroquel and Divlaprox but they stopped working for me and I was too tired. My mood is the most stable I've ever been and I am level headed and clear. I take .5 mg every night and find this is a good dose because I used to take more and was very out of it. This helps me sleep but not be drowsy. Honestly, it's not perfect as I'm dealing with depression currently. I tried prozac but it made me suicidal/dissociate and zombie like and less like myself. Because of this I just recently stopped prozac but I plan to try other antidepressants with this to help my depression. Overall, I love that I mostly feel like myself again. I just want to care about life more now and be less apathetic. DBT therapy helps. Also, acne on my body/face from this but no weight gain so I can't complain too much.",Cara

I started on a low dose but lately I have had to increase the dose to get the most benefits from it. Initially it will make me tired but my acute mania would return after a couple weeks. Been on 4mg for 3 weeks but have noticed that weight gain has been an issue for me, but I'll just have to watch what I eat and exercise more. Currently jumped to 5mg and willing to give it a try. Not too many side effects like somnolence , anxiety, and fatigue which goes away within two weeks. However, I take other meds so I'm trying to figure out if I need a mood stabilizers or other meds that I'm taking. Just want to feel better and finish my degree as an adult student without the excessive tiredness. But I've on Seroquel before, but I got type 2 diabetes from it.

23,Risperdal,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 5, 2018",13,"Works quite well but beware of side effects. I'm an autistic person and also bipolar 1 with psychotic features. Before I started this I had horrible episodes of mania and depression and it made a huge difference. I had almost no maniac episodes, decreased irritability, and it almost completely eliminated the auditory hallucinations. However the weight gain was unbearable, I gained 80 pounds in a year that I still can't lose and diet and exercise did nothing to stop it. I didn't change medications sooner because it worked so well that I was scared to stop it and I was convinced eventually the weight gain would stop, but it didn't.

As an answer to Bipolar Disorder with psychotic features this drug works wonders and I have been without relapse for 3 years now. My biggest frustration however is the weight gain. I have put on 8 kg during this time and I eat like a bird. I have tried a number of diets and exercise 3-4 times per week.

I was still having some evening anxiety so I asked to be moved to 1 mg dosage.  I still had occasional anxiety in the evenings, so I asked to be moved to 1-2 mg dosage.  I find that moving up to a 2 mg dosage causes me some drowsy issues and I am currently tweaking it to where I need it. My anxiety is like nothing I have ever seen or heard anyone experience.  I know there are other people out there that have the same issues.  I think it helps stabilize my highs and lows.

52,Risperdal,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 27, 2013",85,This medication saved my life. Tried several different medicines over 10 years and none have worked better than Risperdal. I take escitalopram as well and have seen fantastic results. If I miss a dose I can tell very quickly within a few days as I don't sleep and feel really agitated and angry at the least little thing. Really helped control my mood swings and this combination has been great for me.,steve 8284matt
53,Risperdal,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,,"June 27, 2013",52,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder about 8 months ago and placed on Risperdal after ending up in the hospital due to a nervous breakdown, 6 weeks after my diagnosis. I was prescribed 0.5 mg in the morning and 1.0 mg in the evenings, but I felt like a zombie. It did curb the severe mood swings, and I also gained about 10 pounds in the first month. I didn't like feeling disconnected from the world and not being able to focus or concentrate, so I independently reduced my evening dose to 0.75 mg. I immediately felt better. I'm still struggling with a low sex drive, depression and have a few moments of hypomania (restlessness, agitation, ""geeked up""), so now my doctor wants me to go on Depakote 500 mg twice a day instead.",DAMcMillan

I've tried about everything and this was the only thing that helped. It doesn't make you feel funny or blank like a lot of them.

I read these reviews after being prescribed and I can honestly say that I was not one who felt its benefits immediately. This medicine takes 3 to 4 weeks to fully affect you. So far the main thing I have noticed is that I feel more balanced, and have not had an over the top anger explosion. This medicine in combination to my others seems to be helping overall. Everyone's own body is a chemistry set, you just have to try things in combination with others and see if it helps. ",Anonymous

It keeps me in a happy middle.  While many other bipolar medicines I have taken have made me feel an inability to feel angry, Risperdal just keeps me from making a huge deal over small issues.  I no longer get mad over petty things, but I do feel angry when something extremely upsetting happens.  I do not feel extreme sadness for no reason any longer, but I do feel it when extreme events happen.  For instance, my grandfather died last week and I was sad about it but I no longer feel depressed for no reason.  The stages of mania I used to experience have almost completely subsided.",Bettyjoe
