0,Duloxetine,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 17, 2022",0,"I began at 30mg, when it started to kick in I essentially felt like I had taken some mdma/amphetamine. Hot flashes, panic, uncontrollable sweating, and even explosive diarrhea to the point where I had lost multiple pounds over the course of one night. After that had mostly subsided, I could not stop grinding my teeth and moving around like I was coming down from some strong stimulant. The twitching was unreal as were the intrusive thoughts, I was extremely exhausted but had so much trouble getting to sleep. For some reason I had taken it the following night before I went to sleep, I awoke in a panic feeling all of the blood pulse throughout my extremities and my vision so blurry that it was a struggle to make out anything around me. I ended up in the ER with stroke level blood pressure and severe hallucinations. The hallucinations and severe anxiety persisted for about three days after taking it for two. Certainly not a fun time!",Anonymous
1,Duloxetine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,,"February 2, 2022",0,"Saved my life. I only use 10 granules in the morning and ten granules at night. Breaking open capsule per my Doctor I was in a major depression. I have been able to get out of bed and do things. I can eat, sleep, going to bathroom ok. Seven years looking for a solution. I also suffer from fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain on my feet which is why I was prescribed this medication even with the risk of mania. Tried the super low dose and it kicked my depression to the curb. I still have pain in feet but body pain goes away. I don't even care about the foot pain because my depression has finally lifted and I don't feel like ending it all anymore. So for me it is a miracle and I am so happy to be alive and not have done anything. Prays to everyone out there suffering with mental health issues, you are not alone.",Beth
2,Duloxetine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 25, 2021",1,"I can only say good things about Cymbalta.  I have been on it about 8 years.  It was prescribed for depression and a little Fibromyalgia (I was pain sensitive to touch).  Well, it worked wonders on both accounts.  At one point I felt I need something extra, so my GP upped me to 120 mg, and I felt no different.  I worked in pharmacy, so I knew 90 was max you could absorb in 1 dose.  So, I went back to 60 mg.  I had no side effects that I noticed.  I had to change GP's, and was sent for Psych evaluation.  I was finally properly diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder mixed episodes.  Occasionally I have a tiny bit of mania/depression.   I had already been taking Trazadone for sleep.  So between the 3 I'm stable, I have moments but not often. I remind others there is no cure, or magic pill.  Meds help YOU manage it. Cymbalta is great!",Kate

I was also misdiagnosed.My emotions felt a little torturous because I couldn’t control my emotions at all.

6,Duloxetine,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 26, 2021",8,"Starting at duloxetine 20 mg I felt nothing, so I moved on to 60 mg with no mood stabilizer at the time for Bipolar 2. Went into a horrific mixed episode, with bad anxiety, self harm, and insomnia, before going to 40 mg. It was much better - I'd tried Prozac and Zoloft and both were awful for me, but Duloxetine was the first that not only improved my mood but never felt noticeably different aside from that. After a few months it got less effective, but I switched to 60 mg again with Lamotrigine and it makes me feel as close to normal as I ever have. I have had mild auditory hallucinations at night, but only when I'm incredibly anxious. Always remember that people's brains work different so don't take my word as law.",ck12

10,Duloxetine,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,,"January 12, 2020",16,"Originally I was put on what I would consider a high dose of 60 mg duloxetine, I was on that for about two years and then I took a year off. After having episodes during that time that I was off I decide to get back onto it. Currently I’m taking 30 mg daily in the morning and 100 mg of trazodone at night. My reason for taking it is due to depression, fatigue and mostly for mania. All three of those have been greatly reduced by the use of the Cymbalta. With the combination of the trazodone is also helped as well in that I’m able to get a better nights sleep which helps aid in less mania overall. Some say it causes them hyper anxiety, I have also experienced that as well but primarily when taking the Cymbalta and then having large amount of caffeine or sugar during the day or morning.",Anon
11,Duloxetine,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,,"June 24, 2019",26,"I've taken Cymbalta twice now with mixed results. The second being very nice results. The first time my psych was being a bit aggressive, I was on adderall, lithium, lamotrigine, seroquel, and trazodone. Adding Cymbalta basically gave me serotonin syndrome and I was hallucinating at work (pretty awful work meeting). However this time I was in a mental hospital for my depression and attempting suicide and the hospital psych prescribed it. I was worried at first, but the pit in my chest went away by the end of my stay, maybe I'm a bit hypomanic now but I feel great. I haven't not wanted to jump off a bridge in years and low I'm good . Even have the courage to quit my crappy job most recently.",Frenchtickler
12,Duloxetine,Bipolar Disorder,,,"May 18, 2019",23,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):I was prescribed Cymbalta for my Bipolar, BPD and PTSD depression episodes. I was on this medication for one week, and I will explain why. At first, this medication did affect my energy level and I felt more productive and positive, waking up in the morning looking forward to the day. The downside as to why I stopped taking this medication is because  Cymbalta began to give me side effects of horrible anxiety. My heart felt like it was in my throat, and not even Ativan I was prescribed would help. The anxiety drove me into madness, intrusive and racing thoughts coming back. The anxiety made me depressed because it was disabling, feeling like my life came to a standstill because the anxiety prevented me from doing hardly anything. I gave this medication a three-star review because I do know people who are taking it, and it works wonders for them and they get no anxiety-related symptoms. Everyone is different, but for me personally, it wasn't a good experience.",Lynne

14,Duloxetine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 15, 2018",32,"I switched on and off different medications for bipolar and in 2009 found the combination of Cymbalta DR 60mg and Depakote DR 500 mg.  I find that one of the drugs without the other do not work.  However, both with DR really helped stabilize my moods, I never cry and get depressed anymore.  The Depakote has stabilized my occasional hypomanic episodes as well!  Hooray!  I will never go off of these because they work!!! High five!  Hopefully this review will convince somebody out there that this combination of drugs is a winner.  The Cymbalta is the least destructive on neurotransmitters as well...another bonus.",Idaho girl

This was not the case for duloxetine. I started on 60 mg and it worked wonderfully for several months, the longest any antidepressant has worked for me. Then, that summer, I became depressed again. After trials of other meds, I wound up back on duloxetine, this time at 90 mg, which worked for another 6 months. I begged for 120 mg but for some reason my psychiatrist refused to prescribe it, so I had to switch to something else.
