0,Lithium,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 21, 2022",0,"I experienced numerous side effects of using lithium for seven years. It did eliminate my severe mania and depression the side effects were devastating. Long term daily issues were coordination, concentration, and serious weight gain. On seven separate occasions I had the rare side effects of hallucinations and psychosis. These lasted up to three days. I live alone and was unable to process information as simple as how to use my phone. It was crazy! As severe as those experiences were the most profound to me was my cognitive processing. I got a college degree in 2000 graduating with a GPA of 8.85. I went back to school while taking lithium and could barely maintain a C average. I even failed three classes. I graduated from that program, stopped taking lithium, and decided to go back to school again. I am about to graduate and I hav a 4.0 GPA. My seven years of taking  lithium  was not a good experience.",Jules
1,Lithium,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 17, 2022",1,"I have bipolar that is hypomanic that was pure pleasure for many years but I am turning forty. I started having isolation issues and a tendency to oversleep and not have any energy. I was blown away when I researched on lithium and how it had such great affects in low doses when it occurs naturally in certain areas water. The positive affects of this medicine are overwhelming and can not be denied. When I first took lithobid 600 mg it was like I was spicy man with better vision, was reading and understanding amazingly, and interacting with my kids playing games etc..... I switched to 450 generic and also added gabapentin and I have had a slight regression. BUT, my anxiety is so regulated, and eating pattern has become so much better. I added in Wellbutrin which will be coming along with gabapentin which I have been taking to counter the memory issues that come with the gaba. What I may do, is just do the 600 lithobid with nothing else. I'm really hoping the Wellbutrin bumps me up though",Felt Obligated
2,Lithium,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 7, 2022",0,"My 16 year old son has Bipolar. Jury is still out on which one, but he is mostly depressed with mixed episodes. In those, he would be aggressive, destructive, risk taking. Tried different meds for 2 years. Lamictal and numerous antipsychotics. His addictions and aggression became worse. Then, before leaving rehab, they finally tried Lithium. He said he felt more calm and even right away. He had a few episodes in the month he was home. Maybe one episode the following month and the last month was episode free. He has stopped using, is calm, less anxious, smiles, doing well in school. It’s honestly been a miracle. I think lithium has an unfair bad reputation. Perhaps the bloodwork scares doctors off. All I know, is that he would not have survived without it. I'm honestly upset they didn’t try it sooner. He is a bit more tired, has had a little belly develop, and craves sweets, but this is way better than the alternative and he agrees. He takes 900 mg IR once daily in the evening",Shel678
3,Lithium,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 4, 2022",0,"This drug has been a life changer. I have  been on probably over 20 different meds to try to battle my bipolar depression and nothing has touched it. After three weeks on lithium I feel I almost forgot that I was depressed. I feel like my old self again. I do seem to be a little sensitive to it. It has made me feel a little jittery and shaky at times. But I’m sure this is my body getting used to the drug. Even if it wasn’t I would still take it for the benefits it’s been giving me. And I didn’t have to wait three weeks to see if it would help, it helped right off the bat. I wish I would’ve tried this drug 15 years ago. If you’re on the bridge about taking this and are battling serious depression do not hesitate! This drug has literally saved my life .",Bipolarlady88
4,Lithium,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,,"February 26, 2022",0,It pretty  much will stop all emotional behavior. If you can't control your emotion a family member or loved one may put you on this. It isn't really the best option but it is an option.  Once the emotion is stopped ✋ you will become a mature adult. Once you can live on logic you will become a better thinker. Think of Spock from Star Trek. Very intelligent and very controlled. It does have major side effects though,Annie Marie

My weight crept up in that fairly short amount of time from 130 to 154 lbs BUT it turned out the lithium had given me hypothyroidism (slightly subclinical but I had all the symptoms) AND after I insisted on thyroid medication and hydrochlorothiazide) ALL (or lots, can't remember) of that weight gain reversed!

9,Lithium,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 23, 2021",0,"I've only been on it a couple of months but I feel so much clearer in my thought patterns, to the point of revelation. My life was a bundle of chaos, particularly with mania where people said I was too exhausting to be around and too much like hard work. I’d had SSRIs and mood stabilisers before, and although I thought lamotrigine and sertraline were working for me, I couldn’t recognise the highs which were leading me to high risk with drugs/sex/alcohol. Lithium has helped me recognise bad habits and remove myself from them. I still have a couple of glasses of wine once or twice a week, but wash it down with loads of water.I am generally more thirsty and need to wee more, but in the grand scheme of things, I can’t see this as being such a bad thing. Sex drive is still there but feel more likely to think about consequences rather than going off impulse. Emotions are still strong but in a good way.

The depression started to lighten after a month, but I still felt agitated and down. I was puffy and gained weight, too. I am so mad I took this drug. It also apparently destroys the kidney and the thyroid, so hypothyroidism is a very real result kind of expected in time. Depakote is the same. Do not take this drug.",Do not use

13,Lithium,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 24, 2021",0,"I’ve been on lithium since 2010 and I genuinely cannot remember what it’s like without it. For better or for worse. The post positive thing I can say is that it helped tone down my hypomanic episodes so that they were/are more manageable. Was it worth it? That depends on how well you tolerate the drug and how okay you are with careful monitoring via blood tests. Lithium is pretty mild when you’re on the right dose, but going over that is no good. It’s a constant experiment, which for me involved a lot of awful, awful nausea, among other things. My dose was too high for a while and I was both sick and down because it only works for my highs, not lows, I’m not sure about others. I’m giving it a 7 because it technically worked but caused me great suffering. Anyway, you could argue it’s one of the more natural paths to go down since it’s just a simple, basic element.",dietsoba

16,Lithium,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 5, 2021",0,"On first initiation with lithium, this drug was a miracle cure for ""mania"" and ""anxiety"" and ""depression"".  For 20-30 yrs. it was well tolerated at 900mg maintenance.  As the years went on it progressed, problems such as weight gain, kidney failure, hypothyroidism, diabetes 2, flat affect (which I liked for some strange personal reason) progressed.  In the past 10 years, it became difficult to tolerate, and my dose was not decreased upon request, ultimately leading to coma, in episodes or interaction between antihypertensives, where the dose was reduced in half by ER drs.I would not say that this is a great drug for acute mania, and strange effect on both depression and mania.  However, I think, in my case 40 yrs. has been too long.I would like to report on this one, upon second review, now that I am reducing down to 0, and really not sure what the future will bring:""Lithium in Neuropsychiatry"", The Comprehensive Guide-- some bias FOR lithium esp. on the stats of discontinuation.",mmmousemaid

I was rapid cycling with mixed states when I sought medication. Lithium has definitely leveled me out.

21,Lithium,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,,"August 6, 2021",3,"Started lithium in 2017, along with buspirone and quetiapine.

Memory problems start affecting my job - I forget to do tasks, send emails to the wrong people, go through meetings not understanding what's being discussed. Doc thought the issue was quetiapine so he tried to reduce it, with no results. Before lithium, I was known to be sharp and reliable, and I was one of the top performers in my job. Now I quit lithium 1 week ago and I'm taking PTO so I don't have to work while I wait for lithium effects to clear from my system. I've never been as calm and controlled in my life, but it's like my mind is not in this world.

It definitely turned my life around for the better.Unfortunately, my thyroid is starting to show some wear and tear... still within normal limits but my psych is weaning me off of it just in case. Hoping to find something that works half as well as lithium. I'd say one of the biggest downsides is  when providers see it on your medication list and seem to pass judgment. Not a fan of that.

She constantly had tormenting voices that was making her very agitated; it was very hard to deal with. This was going on for ten years and we tried antipsychotics, lamictal and everything in-between and she hated everything. Lithium made a dramatic difference. Takes a little while to get used to but totally changed things around and made her a different person.  One day she decided that she no longer needs meds and she went back directly to the crazy state.  It is important that people stick with the medication.

The docs wants me to go higher on lithium but I said no, luckily I have a choice in that! If it doesn't work on this does then what makes them think it will 200mg a little extra? That's just going to make me gain even more weight and then even more sad and sick of myself! Covid isn't helping either so maybe it's a mixture of that and the medication.

32,Lithium,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,,"December 16, 2020",5,"I was prescribed lithium after trying a host of other drugs including seroquil, olanzepine, Wellbutrin, abilify and many others.

The psychiatrist who prescribed this to me said that it was the cure for bipolar to combine Lithium and Lamictal so I was eager to try it. I was only on it for 5 days. I had to stop because my job requires me to drive a lot, and I was getting tired early on in the day, almost to the point of  being drowsy like I was on a high dose of Xanax or something. Also, after looking up all the long term side effects , I wasn’t too thrilled about taking it anymore anyway. However I will say my mind was much clearer on this medication and it made me more articulate. I was still pretty irritable though. My new psychiatrist added 100mg of Lamictal in the morning along with the  200mg of Lamictal at night so we’ll see if that helps.",hi

The only side effect I experience is increased thirst- a small price to pay for getting my life back.",NHelm
89,Lithium,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,,"January 25, 2019",20,"I have bipolar 2 disorder and my psychiatrist prescribed me lithium. Have already been on antipsychotics but we were intending on switching medication. I also have PTSD. Day 5 on lithium and it has noticeably made my PTSD and associated ‘mental pain’ far worse and far more distracting and disabling. The effects of this is reduced motivation, increased tiredness, loss of smooth social skills, impaired cognitive functions. It’s not as severe as you may think, I can still function, but it has made living less pleasant and made it harder to get things done. I also experienced hand tremors for a few minutes which were unpleasant. Overall I would say it has an emotional numbing effect which detaches you from feeling things strongly so it is more difficult to function and interact with life. If you experience mania and say experience happiness far too strongly it could be helpful, but other medications (antipsychotics) are better (in my experience).",Danjwp

I can actually function again in life, and at my job! Plus, my anxiety levels are pretty much nothing now.

Prior to diagnosis,  I had a self-diagnosed problem with alcohol (self-medicating likely) and since Lithium I hardly ever drink, maybe 2-3 times a year and only 1-2 at a time. I no longer get the same feelings from alcohol, which is odd and true. I consider that a plus. On the negative side, I had beautiful hair and now it’s dry and dull, so I’m always trying new products.

294,Lithium,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,,"December 3, 2009",45,I was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder 18 months ago and put on lithium 600mgs a day and Seroquel 300mg at night.  The lithium has been wonderful to stabilize my moods and keep me from feeling so down and depressed. I eventually weaned myself from the Seroquel because it made me lethargic and I had weight gain that I contributed to it not the lithium.  I now exercise - run 3 miles a day to help me release any pent up anger or negative energy and it works wonders.  Lithium maybe one of the oldest bi-polar medicines but it is tried and true.,Anonymous

I was hospitalized for six months before they found the right medicine that worked for me.  They tried so many anti-depressant that did not work until these. Now they think I might be bipolar because the lithium was the one that worked. I did have some side effects like dry mouth, tremors, had trouble with doing small things with my hands like writing. But in time this went away. Lithium did cause hypothyroidism in the 2nd year. That will not go away even if I go off Lithium.

I was also taking Seroquel and Imipramine.  I put on 50 lbs and my wife kept commenting on how I was listless and ""zoned out"".  This was a big problem because I write fiction for a living, which requires energy and alertness.  With my doctor I started tweaking the Seroquel and Imipramine and finally quit them altogether (the info sheets for both state they ""may result in weight gain"").
