0,Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 19, 2022",0,"This is my 3rd review. I finally stopped this medication after 6 weeks of living nightmare. I was over medicated on this medication which caused severe dissociation and a very weird feeling. I have ptsd and trauma from it. But overall I also want to share I cried all the time on this medication. I was depressed and laid in bed all the time, and had suicidal thoughts. I had those side effects 2 separate times I was out on it. My doctor kept increasing the dose which made me worse. The greater the dose the more those side effects worsened. I am now on asenapine. I haven’t cried in over a month. I feel happy. I get out of bed. Please don’t stay on this if you feel depressed! Try another medication. And if you feel weird and severe brain fog your on too much! I thought for so long it was my mental illness but it was the medication. Stay strong and know things do and will get better.",Kait2149

2,Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 5, 2022",0,Geodon (ziprasidone):This is my second review. I just want to warn everyone about this drug. I felt suicidal  because of my horrible experience of taking it for 2 months. I felt drugged on this medication my doctor went from 20mg to 80mg twice daily over several weeks. At 20-40mg twice daily I felt weird like I viewed life from a strange perspective and at 60-80mg I felt drunk all day long. I was crying all the time depressed and suicidal also very moody. I switched to asenapine and so far the veil between me and the world has been lifted but suffering withdrawal now. Terrible anxiety and trauma from this drug.,Drug is poison
3,Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 20, 2022",0,"Geodon (ziprasidone):I have been taking antidepressants for approximately 20 years now. I normally find one that works well and am able to maintain progress for years until it just stops working. I take Geodon (20mg, CL62 Generic ONLY) at night, after eating at least 600 calories. The catch 22: I have little to no appetite, so it is often a chore to decide on something to eat in order to fulfill that caloric requirement. I say requirement because if I ever fall short of those 600 at night, the next day, I will have extreme anxiety (day-long panic attacks) & various other side effects. It took me almost 8 months of suffering to figure that part out on my own. I've also noticed that my caloric intake during the day needs to be at a similar level or the panic/paranoia/overheating/nausea will creep its way into my day. I just wanted to share my ""ah hah"" with anyone else who may be suffering through ANXIETY & other effects while trying to stay with an otherwise miracle med.",600 Cal Req

I have Bipolar I and was literally at absolutely rock bottom, dealing with intrusive thoughts and severe depression for 2 years. I had tried Abilify, Seroquel, Risperdal, Latuda (I take Lamotrigine, Intuniv, and Lithium). After 1 week, I feel like my old self! It is incredible. I would normally never leave a review like this, but it's honestly changed my life. If you haven't had success with other anti-psychotics, give it a try. Don't give up!!",Ray

I took it along with a low dose pregabalin and my stomach got huge due to the pregabalin as well as this drug. It made me constipated and even after stopping pregabalin, I couldn't lose weight. I had to stop ziprasidone and switched back to rexulti. This medication also made me super anxious. I couldn't stop shaking when I would wake up in the mornings and even after stopping it I still feel a sense of panic and dread when I wake up but it's going away. Thank God for rexulti.",Pingu

I liked that it is weight neutral. After about a week on it though, the world started to seem big and scary. I noticed I had more anxiety and anger. Fast forward a few more days and the anger turned into full on rage. I actually was soo worked up and ticked at my psychiatrist that I hurriedly got in my car, drove like a bat out of hell to his office and left a very mean note that he's a horrible doctor. I'm glad I didn't see him because I wanted to punch him. I would have ended up in jail, because this is NOT like me. I couldn't deal with the aggressive feelings and wanted off ASAP.",Bsmom

10,Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 9, 2021",0,"I was on this medication for 6 months. It felt great, my moods were more stable and even if something did upset me, I was able to see the situation more clearly and calm down faster. I also was able to manage my weight better. The problem being that I wasn’t warned of the risks or side effects of this medication. I developed tardive dyskinesia within a month of starting it, but I didn’t know the possible severity of the condition. I didn’t mention it because I felt it was the only medication that has worked for me. My doctor told me this was my only other choice after trying abilify and risperidone (it was not, there are more). Flash forward 5 months later, and the TD has gotten significantly worse. After a long battle with my previous dr, I finally went to a new psych and they started tapering me off of it. I took 40mg 2x a day, and when I stopped taking my nighttime dose, I couldn’t sleep. Do not take this med unless your dr tells you everything about the risks.",Anonymous

13,Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 22, 2021",0,"I am taking ziprasidone 80 mg at night for my bipolar. At first the drug made me feel extremely lethargic and sleepy when I would first take it, I could not get up from the bed or move until next morning. The sedating effect goes away and gets better after a while. The drug makes me feel like I am very confident and gives me the will to take care of myself where as on previous olanzapine I would not even brush my hair most days. The only bad part is the constant feeling of being mildly sick in my throat and sometimes my nose running. But it comes and goes and not that annoying. Out of all the annoying medications I had to take I would rate this one the highest so far. I actually feel like a person while on it.",Pprha

15,Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 18, 2021",0,I think this is the best antipsychotic.  I also have CPTSD so my thoughts can be all over the place. Within no time of taking this my focus was so clear which really helped me feel back in control again. For mild bipolar2 I've found it stabilised me after about 3 weeks. I can still go a bit high but I'm taking Prazosin for PTSD which keeps me asleep & so stops the high from escalating,Donna
16,Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 27, 2021",11,"Geodon (ziprasidone):This is by far the worst medication I have ever taken for my bipolar. I would give this a zero if I could. I didn’t feel terrible at first but I noticed some mild paranoia and anxiety. I ignored it though because I was actually more motivated and able to get more things done and I was finally losing weight. I desperately wanted this med to work. The doctor increased my dose and things got bad very quickly. I was having intense delusions, the worst I’ve ever had. They were so bad that I would just start crying because I was so scared. The brain fog, memory problems, and dissociation on this medication are awful as well. I feel so out of it all the time and I even went the the ER because it felt like I had been drugged. My head constantly feels funny. I’m dizzy and lightheaded. My vision is blurry. Currently switching to a different med and dealing with awful withdrawal. Hopefully the side effects go away soon.

17,Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,,"June 24, 2021",0,"Ziprasidone has changed my life.  In 26 years of trying to treat my bipolar disorder, I have never found a medication that works as well as ziprasidone at managing my symptoms.  It keeps depression at bay while preventing me from swinging into hypomania, and I haven’t slept this well in as long as I can remember.  I wake each day feeling refreshed with a sense of calm wellbeing, and my mood is smooth and steady.In the beginning and while titrating to my current dose (40 mg twice a day), the side effects were pretty rough.  I had gastrointestinal issues with multiple bouts of diarrhea in the morning, and it gave me akathisia, which was quite uncomfortable and made falling asleep difficult.  My doctor prescribed 50 mg of hydroxyzine for the akathisia, which worked extraordinarily well (and has also helped me sleep through the night).  Once I had been on Geodon for several weeks, the side effects subsided, and I was left with excellent mood stability.",Dave--42 yo male

Anyhow, 10 years later I'm asking for it in desperation since everything else has not worked very good for so long.  My doctor prescribed it just the other day 20 mg twice a day.  I'm already feeling better and I don't care if I gain weight this time.  However, my doctor told me to eat at least a half banana if not a meal close to the time I take it.  He also prescribed me a drug called Topamate to help with the weight gain.  I haven't taken any of that as yet because I'm concerned about the reviews I've seen.

I was put on Geodon going on 4 weeks now. As far as mood, its amazing. I have headaches, and last Saturday night my heart was racing and felt like my whole throat, neck and head was pounding and going to explode. I sat up the entire night on the couch so I wouldn't fall asleep because I was so afraid I was going to have a heart attack. I took my regular dose the following morning and it went away. I just now read online about consuming 500+calories when taking it. I wasn't doing that, I was never told to, nor was any emphasis put on the seriousness of eating enough each dosage. I would just love to hear if anyone else has experiences the severe heart pounding for hours.

21,Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,,"March 18, 2021",1,"I took Geodon for many years as a kid, from about 13-17 years old. My mood swings were gone. But it had truly awful side effects. If I didn't take it with food, I would fall asleep 30 minutes later and could not be woken up for anything for about two hours. I remember one time sitting on the bottom shelf at a clothing store, sleeping with my head in my hands and my elbows against my knees, thoroughly exhausted and completely unable to move. After that, I was impossible to sleep for at least 10 hours, which is horrible as a developing teenager. As an adult with randomly developed epilepsy, I now know that it was so giving me seizures in my sleep, basically every night; horrible dreams of unspeakable fear, flashing lights, pulsing sounds, physical shock-feelings. If I didn't take it at the same time every day, I got really bad withdrawal symptoms; unable to sleep, every light was painfully bright, every sound was ear-splitting, every texture felt like sand paper, I couldn't think right.",Chraass

I have taken lamotrigine for about 1 year now with the clonazepam. These two were great for me until this year when I started having delusional thoughts (intense fear of someone abducting me, people reading my thoughts). I also experienced dissociation while driving when my anxiety was intense. My dr prescribed me 20 mg of this and after 2 weeks of being on it, I am starting to feel like myself again as far as emotions go. However I do think I’m in a mild state of mania during the day until I take geodon at night. I’m taking it at night since it makes me sleepy within a few hours. I do have a loss of appetite but I just force myself to eat. My obsessive/delusional thoughts are subsiding but the hypomania is still around.

My paranoia came back while on the medication (I have psychosis that comes in waves in addition to my diagnosis of bi polar 2), so apparently the 80mg I was taking was largely placebo. Warning to anyone who attempts to titrate off this med: you will get every side effect imaginable. I had rebound OCD mania. My skin was tingly. The brain zaps were very intense, and my cognition was about that of a goldfish. Could hardly string together whole sentences.

I was also incredibly nauseous to the point where I didn't eat hardly anything for about a month and lost about 15 pounds.

Sometimes it sedates you and sometimes it doesn't. I found to avoid eating beef and hot liquids with the medication especially hot coffee.  I take 40mg twice a day. Otherwise it works very well at smoothing out the peaks of mania and mixed states. Doesn't do much for depression or Anhedonia. I wonder if in a way it causes the Anhedonia by preventing excitation.  It doesn't mess with cognition though and makes you feel like you're not taking a med.  And I didn't gain any weight on it too!,Jay Pal

I felt so much better after my first month on it that I went out and got a job at McDonalds restaurant and have been in management there as a trainer for the last three years. This drug has been a huge success with me when all others failed and I plan to take it for the rest of my life. I would highly recommend it at low doses to anyone. The higher doses cause horrible dizziness, so the lower doses work better. I have not heard a single voice in three years and Geodon has made a believer out of me. Bravo!",Anonymous
