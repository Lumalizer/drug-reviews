0,Depakote,Bipolar Disorder,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 21, 2022",0,"I have been taking Depakote for 2.5 years I have adult ADHD which was treated well with stimulants (Concerta) for many years. The VA does not prescribe ADHD meds so they prescribed Depakote and Ziprasidone.  The first night I took them I woke up during the night and felt so intoxicated I couldn’t make it to the bathroom without assistance. I tried the meds for a few more days, called the VA and told them I was dropping the Ziprasidone because I was completely incapacitated. I continued with the Depakote. I had regular blood tests and each time my dosage was increased in an attempt to get the medication blood level to where it is supposed to be ~100. I went from 125mg up to 2000mg daily.  The side effects became extreme. Hand and face tremors, blurred vision, slurred speech, dizziness, inability to walk straight, hangover, emotionless or weeping, zero libido. The highest my blood maker got was low 60’s. I have since backed off to 1500mg (500mg am, 1000mg pm). Hate it!",Frazzled
1,Depakote,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 26, 2022",0,"I've spent my life since puberty trying various SSRIs and one SNRI with poor outcomes. Finally, I received a BP2 diagnosis and since then have been on this medication for a little over a year. I've had neither crushing lows nor frenzied highs since starting this medicine. Even old triggers, like poor sleep or the onset of wintertime do not cause me much disturbance anymore. This is the only drug I take for my condition. It has significantly curbed my anger and anxiety as well. The only side effects are nausea and stomach cramps if I take it on an empty stomach. The pills smell like vanilla and have a coating that makes it easy to swallow (doesn't stick to your throat).For the first time in a decade I feel very close to ""normal"". I have hope for my future. For me, this medicine has been a blessing. Bipolar is a serious neurological condition, never be afraid to seek help and advocate for yourself.

2,Depakote,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2022",0,"To be honest I now reject the value of sharing your experiences online with other people. But if you have bipolar like I likely do, then this is a medication worth talking to your doctor about.The problem is, this is not a medication to take lightly. It can really damage your liver if you're not careful, and you need to discontinue it carefully instead of one day deciding not to take it. This is not something you order in a fast food drive thru and expect to take without losing part of your old self. I used to be a compulsive artist and maybe it's a good thing I'm not that anymore, but I liked who I was.My experiences so far....(1-2 weeks)....I feel like I can actually relate with people better. I'm not broody or angsty. My migraines have disappeared. I don't think i'll be manic anymore, but I never knew that who I really was == a manic person. So I guess I have bipolar? I never felt that way but that's why I'm not a doctor.",FreudianSlipper

Multiple drugs and alcohol related problems from trying to self medicate. I can rapid cycle between moods so quickly it can be scary. Also when I am having a manic episode, I feel like the world is ending and nothing is worth living for. I tried many medications. To name a few: zoloft, wellbutrin, deplin, mirtazapine, lithium..... none worked, in fact a couple made me literally freak out and I got baker acted. When I was in the hospital the psych they had me stop taking lithium and start depakote and I thought - here we go again, I'll probably be in jail or dead soon. Within 1 week, I had my emotions back, was actually feeling happy, and could feel that my mood was stabilized. This medication has saved my life.

It helped so, so much. I feel like wanting to do things and it gave me a boost of energy. No Depression medications worked on me not even Paroxetine and Lithium. I am thankful that I found Depakote. Although I'm having crying episodes at night and afternoon, it goes away after an hour. I didn't gain weight even though it made me hungry. Just control what you eat so you don't gain weight on the medicine. The medication also made me ignore my impossible fears that I kept imagining happening.

12,Depakote,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 10, 2021",0,"My experience with Depakote was terrible.  From severe weight gain to becoming bipolar to eventually being completely subdued and dumbed down.  In three months, while still being sick and hardly eating at all, I had gone from having lost 15 pounds due to my illness to gaining upwards of 50 pounds  in two months on Depakote.  This took me from 222 to over 270 lbs and my body did not level off in weight gain until I hit over 300 pounds. Needless to say, the doctors took me off Depakote and eventually put me back on Dilantin brand.  For me, this drug was a real nightmare and over 10 years later I have still not lost the weight it caused me to gain.  Personally, I would stay away from Depakote but, if you do take it, be careful about the weight gain side effect.  It's brutal.",Troy J.

I have anxiety that cripples me emotionally and physically, but when I started this I literally felt a weight lift off my shoulders. At first (didn’t last long) it made me a little drowsy, but I didn’t mind, rather be drowsy than panicky and fidgety with racing thoughts.I will say this medication works better for me in smaller doses.

I will say when I first started it, I felt less dead inside. That turned into feeling nothing at all, almost as if I had artifical emotions. I had to act out emotions on given situations. I told my physchiatrist who told me to give it more time but in all honesty I don't want to. I'd rather feel pain/sorrow and manic episodes than this emptiness.",Benny
15,Depakote,Bipolar Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 4, 2021",5,"I was diagnosed with anxiety and symptoms that are similar to bipolar. I have tried about ten different types of medications in which none of them helped. Depakote was the only one that did help. My anxiety and stress levels were significantly lower. However, after approximately two years of taking it, it started causing four times the amount of liver enzymes that I should have had. I am now off of it and my liver enzymes are back to normal. Not to mention, there is a pretty strong correlation between birth defects and this medication so you should not take this medication if you are going to be pregnant in the near future.",Demi

Bad news I've gained 35 pounds, have less sex drive..and thining part of hair on the front but not sure if that's the Depakote..but lots of people say so. Apparently on 1000 mg a day that happens. I'd say it's a grey medicine for your anxiety and stress. Maybe only take 500mg a day. Just like any of these medications u will gain weight and have cons. But honestly I was forced in it from the mental hospital a year ago it did the trick it fixed my u life...and I love my kids I still have emotions. Worst part is the weight gain and tiredness.",B

21,Depakote,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 27, 2020",47,"This is a very effective drug for most people with bipolar and anger disorders. It can be used in higher doses when there is also a diagnosis of insomnia. It does different things to different people but it is generally tolerated well. I'm a RN with bipolar and also work with a psychiatric population. Just a PSA: if you have a loved one with psychiatric issues in a facility because you don't want to/can't deal with taking care of them yourself, you have no right to complain when the facility medicates for behavior issues. 1) You didn't want to deal with it yourself but now you expect others to 2) ""behaviors"" usually indicate the patient is in a distressed state; nobody hits/kicks/screams/refuses care because they are comfortable and happy. It might upset you that mom can't be away exactly when you want her to be, but it's really not about you.

I chose Depakote while knowing nothing about it. I've had three manic episodes in my life and Depakote's brought me back down from every one. And since I have mixed episodes, they get really dangerous, so I probably owe Depakote my life. Only downside I've experienced is nausea and vomiting, it can hit pretty hard and out of nowhere sometimes. Made me want to stop the drug at one point, but for me the pros outweigh the cons.You have to get your blood tested every few months and it interacts with some other medications (like Lamictal) so take care.",nonenn

I did not lose hair on the Depakote or have any nasty side effect but I did gain weight. Now its stable and I changed my diet and started exercising.

It made my depression significantly worse, I gained 50 lbs, slept all day and had no feelings. I am a talkative person by nature, and on this drug I barely uttered a word. I'm sure it may work for those with true mania, but I'd say if on too high of a dose, or even a low dose, weight gain is inevitable and sugar/carb cravings.

Increased to 1500 mg 4 days later which led to more tremors and violent vomitting. Dr suggested splitting the doses am/pm.  Within 2 hours of taking the am dose the next day- same violent vomitting.  Confirmed no stomach bug. His body was unable to handle the level of Depakote. Now, No longer taking.I've read many positive reviews on this medication , but sadly ours is not one of them due to his  adverse reactions.",Still Looking for Answers

I started seeing Depakote's first signs of mood stabilization after a week on 500mg daily (a very small dose). It was great to have a clear mind. At the low dose I've been on, I would say my Bipolar symptoms are about 75% under control, which is great. I can also sleep easier.In terms of side-effects, all I've gotten are vivid dreams on a nightly basis (not nightmares, but sometimes uncomfortable) and very brief auditory hallucinations (hear a loud bang, like a door closing, stuff like that). The hallucinations happen about two times per night, but I've been through worse hallucinations on SSRIs, so I am not too concerned.

151,Depakote,Bipolar Disorder,3.0,,"September 10, 2010",28,I was prescribed 500mg Depakote twice per day. I does make me feel sleepy and the MD stated I needed to take both in the evening. I did so and awoke feeling like I was jacked up and bouncing off the walls. I thought what the hell is going on. So I took another dose and an hour later had a nap and I was fine. The downside of the medication does make me feel like a zombie. My concentration is nil and confused a lot. Currently I do not have any insurance and when I go to the ER they say just wait to you see your MD next month. I am very frustrated but learned the hard way to not discontinue your medicines. I did so and got in a lot of trouble.,bobc3
152,Depakote,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,,"August 14, 2010",27,"I was prescribed 250 mg, but to take three times a day (every 8 hours).  I don't think that's really too high.  Perhaps it's because I was on such high doses of other things in my past--who knows.  So, to me, my body is used to truly high doses of such medicines.  Either way, 250mg of Depakote DR is the lowest you can be given, and that will only carry you through part of the day.  This is why the doctor has to make you take it three times a day.I haven't had practically any side effects, except for a little ""wet noodly"" feeling, but none of the side effects (yet) that are listed.  Guess it's different for everyone.",thenightowl1234

This is why it is SO important you care about your health from day one and it should be a part of your lifestyle and regimen, no matter what.  This way, whatever the side effects are of the medicine, you're on top of your game and won't get hit as hard.I've been on many bipolar medications which make you gain weight, but I barely noticed because I work out and eat very healthy.  It's of utter importance that you lay down a solid, healthy foundation before and during therapy.  The healthy lifestyle will also make the medicine work better.  It's common sense.",thenightowl1234

I am currently on 1000 MG per day, but have taken as high as 2000 MG per day. On 1000 MG per day I am (or have been somewhat stabilized, which leaves me somewhat hypo manic which seems to be the best level for me. I say somewhat stabilized because I started to go hyper manic in the past 2 weeks, have no idea why. Going to see doctor tomorrow).For the 2 years or so when I was on 2000 per day I was also taking 40 MG per day of Paxil. My moods were stabilized all right, but I turned into a zombie.I have never taken another mood stabilizer so I can not make comparisons. Depakote makes me gain weight big time!",jessigirl

156,Depakote,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,,"July 6, 2010",94,"I am shocked to read the high amount of mg's that people are being started on. Every review I have read about Depakote it's been mainly 1000mg also 500mg. That just blows my mind! With any medicine you have to be eased into things and adjust from there! I began with 250mg, my Doctor told me that after a few weeks I could adjust it to taking 2 doses (500mg). Just to play around with it to see if I in fact needed to go higher. So I did, when changed to 500mg it made me crazy, nutty, mean and intolerable. I backed off and on 250mg again. I have been normal and perfectly stable ever since. I have yet to read a person taking the lowest dosage as a starting point. Start slow and work your way up (if needed). This medicine has been a lifesaver!",busybee2

When the dose was upped to 1500mg she had daily migraines.

I had a little hair loss, at doses above 1000mg, but it's been great in stabilizing my mood swings. If I go off of it, I have an episode within a month. I had no weight gain (actually lost weight I had gained from taking Seroquel previously). I take it with Wellbutrin SR and a little Abilify.  But the Depakote is by far the most effective.

161,Depakote,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,,"March 6, 2010",53,"Took depakote for almost ten years (300 x 3)...now I will admit I had three minor episodes in that time. Super, yes, I know but I started at 140 lbs in six months I bottomed out at 206lbs. I slept 12 hours a night, plus a nap of 2 hours in the evening. Someone finally caught the Depakote/Paxil fiasco, and lithium and wellbutrin became my friends...more importantly, I feel like I ""woke up"". I lived the life, but it seemed so surreal looking back on it...IT completely controlled me. It's not the Wellbutrin and the Paxil, it's the lack of Depakote (and for a large part, Paxil) that made me almost another person. I'm sure Depakote works for thousands of people...it just took me out of the equation TOO much.",troyz

164,Depakote,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,,"December 7, 2009",41,"I was prescribed this because it is a mood stabilizer.  In other words, I sank down pretty low in mood with long term stressors such as death of family members and a couple of moves, not going to AA and not being in therapy (ugh). I started this recently and at 500 mg seemed to be able to sleep.  At 1000 mg, I was restless.  If I'm feeling low then it's doing what it's supposed to I suppose.  I will cut back to the 500 mg and take it in the morning and see if it makes me sleepy or hyper.  I take 22 mg of Buspar at night because I was also suffering from anxiety that was not letting me sleep.  I liked the fact that Depakote works well almost immediately, and I was assured that after three weeks, I should feel ""normal"" again and can quit.",larubia69

For whatever reason, I did not respond to Depakote as a mood stabilizer.  This is surely not the case for everyone.  The problem is that while taking this medicine, I gained 30 pounds, as I constantly felt hungry.  I was warned ahead of time that this tends to keep the brain from perceiving fullness (or something to that effect).  I noticed this within a few days of starting Depakote but continued taking it because I didn't have many other options at the time.  The weight gain created an entirely new aspect of depression.  Just something to keep in mind if you're just starting it and weight gain is an issue.",Anonymous
