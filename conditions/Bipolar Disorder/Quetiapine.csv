I have had insomnia all my life, but it became severe and unremitting about a year ago when I became severely depressed/anxious. Started on Lithium and then 25mg seroquel and went up to 100mg seroquel. It never helped my insomnia or my mood and caused constipation. I was on it for about 7 months. Big issue - now trying to get off and having major withdrawal problems. Mild insomnia, excessive sweating, severe abdominal pain. Something new every time I lower the dose by 12mg. I recommend staying on this drug only if you see significant progress. I wish I had been taken off sooner.",Bipolar II

I have been having increased anxiety a few hours after taking it for bed which leads into panic attacks for the past month. I have terrible insomnia and was going through a manic episode over summer Of 2021 and tried Depakote prior which did nothing and even tried Latuda which gave me twitches. The seroquel knocked me out and made me sleep so good along with clonazepam. I even got it upped to 100 from 50 mg but noticed nothing and even stayed up all night most nights on 100mg. I’m so sad this seems to not work for me anymore so I’ll give it a 5/10 because it works but then it stopped. I didn’t gain weight, sex was fine, just did it’s job with controlling manic episodes and panic attacks and insomnia for me. Wish one pill did wonders for me.",Bstevenrrr

Cut forward 10/13 years I've been really struggling controlling my thoughts and mood so I sought out help and they put me back on seroquel.  To my surprise the medicine had me pretty sedated the first 3 days or so and is slowly building up in my system. I feel so much better my mood is not constantly up and down, I don't have racing thoughts, I don't suicidal. I was iffy about getting back on it just because I remember as a teen trying to get off it, and the sleepless nights however I am very pleased with this drug right now.

Lamotrigine + mini dose Vyvanse). quetiapine helped me fall asleep like nothing else I've tried before. Wake up after 8h rested. First attempts I was very irritable day after, almost couldn't go to work! But that resolved when taken for a few days. Makes food taste delicious in the evening after I've taken it and I eat much if I don't go to sleep immediately. Still lost 9lbs (~5%) weight and was told it's a rare side effect. Less appetite daytime so I have to remember to eat healthy snacks between meals. Much less dry mouth and stuffy nose compared to other sedatives. Only use 25-50mg PM for sleep but helps with fatigue, concentration during daytime. Had bad experience at first so made me vary of trying again. BP meds are weird, they change the effects of each other so it seems to be worth to try again sometimes after failed attempts before.",Rodger

7,Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 7, 2022",3,"Seroquel (quetiapine):I once rated this medication highly for my initial positive experience with it. I now believe that is only because it helps me sleep. Once I got up to 200 mg, I felt like a zombie and experienced some other concerning symptoms. When I expressed my concerns I was told that this was a ""baby dose"" and they intended to still increase from there. I disagreed. I have weaned down to a sleeping aid dose and intend to decrease from there and get off this stuff. It's terribly addicting. When I was at 200 mg I used to experience withdrawal like symptoms if I was accidentally late to take my nightly dose, splitting headaches, shaking. I've seen some say it can be dangerous to not have an exact time each day it is taken, but this was never expressed to me by the psychiatrists who prescribed me. This is not an opiate, but there's a reason some people sell this and call it ""baby heroin"". If you get prescribed it for sleeping, it did help with that.",lalalalala

11,Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 1, 2022",2,"This medicine works exceptionally well for my bipolar depression and even helps with hyper vigilance from PTSD. It also is a lifesaver for sleep. Beware, this drug is very sedating! Best taken at night. Once a day instant release is best, take at bed time. I try and stay away from the XR because the sedation is a struggle during the day. Aside from sleepiness, it will also make you gain weight. Just go in knowing this and be proactive about it! Meaning, start weight management as soon as you start the med, don’t wait until you suddenly start putting weight on. This drug WILL slow down your metabolism and change the way the body processes carbs. But it is NOT impossible to maintain or even lose significant weight all while being on this medicine. No need to eliminate food categories, just eat as natural as possible (lots of fruits, veggies: yes even the starchy potato, and whole grains).",UrF8

16,Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 24, 2021",1,"I don't usually add a comment to these websites, because they are not all that interesting. To those of you who are doing well with using this drug OFF LABEL as a sleep medication and want to know why, it is quite obvious that a lower dose will work for sleep issues. If your doctor has not told you they are using the drug off label, they aren't giving you all the information to you about how it is supposed to be used. Some of you want to know how the rest of us can handle such a high dose and wonder if you are abnormal in only being able to take a small dose and wonder if those of us who have other illnesses really need it that high to treat a mental illness are different. My answer is yes, there are a such thing as mental illnesses that need treatment. Those of us who take the medication are not abnormal for our illness to treat it we need a higher dose. It doesn't mean we are abnormal. For a sedative it is used at a low dose.",tjoceans
17,Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,,"October 22, 2021",0,"Like most have said this stuff will knock you out however you might get to point of tolerance and having to increase the dose. There was a few comments of how could someone take such a high dose that the low dose knocks them out. If you use this medication for bipolar it has more than just sleeping effects it helps suppress your mania, depression etc. You eventually build up to those high doses which yes you feel like you are drowsy all day. But that goes away eventually. Like most have said they think it is hard if you choose go off it. It’s unlikely is it probably has to do with how the drug interacts with your circadian rhythm so getting back to a normal sleep cycle without the drug will take some time. Only thing I don't like about the drug is the weight gain and abdominal distension .",Karrie

It worked really well to calm me down as the mania was happening and it worked in the long term too for preventing manic or depressive episodes. I had to stop Quetiapine in April 2021 due to a side effect of jerky legs after taking a dose which severely affected my sleep, I previously tried procyclidine to help with this side effect but it didn't seem to do much, if anything. After discussing again with my psychiatrist I was swapped to 4mg Risperidone starting at 1mg and titrating up. After about 6 weeks I started having episodes again and a manic episode landed me in hospital again.So, Quetiapine worked well for what I needed it for, it stabilised me and kept me episode-free for nearly 2 years but unfortunately came with a side effect I just couldn't tolerate.I'm now on Chlorpromazine and Lithium.",Alex D

Then I was switched to Effexor, which again helped and pushed me into milder hypomania. Same story, 6 months later it just pooped out. My diagnose was changed to Bipolar 2 (doc increased Effexor and started Lamictal and this combo didn't work at all). Then I've tried Olanzapine and Prozac combo (in 7 days +4kg) so I quit. Then Paroxetine with Ladiomil (didn't work). I was desperate. I tried Wellbutrin, then Tianeptine - 0 change. Quit all, started Seroquel 300mg. In 10 days I started to feel depression is lifting.

I used to wake in the middle of the night, scared and to my whole room spinning around me and cold sweat. The worst part is that I felt even more depressed than I did at the beginning. It helped for mania but didn‘t help at all against my depression. I feel like it made it worse because I was tired 24/7. I wasn't as anxious as I was before though. I had to get off it because I had to go to the doctors bc I literally couldn't pee anymore. That‘s a not so common side effect of anti psychotics.

I was on an extremely low dose (150 mg, starting at 100 mg) and am getting off of it just 6 weeks later. After coming out of my mental fog a bit, the side effects of the Quetiapine grossly outweigh the benefits: muted overall mood, ending in a neutral presentation (for a person who has never been calm, this is an automatic red flag), amplification of negatuve affect, loss of energy (all-day sedation), and physical arm-twitching. I am, unfortunately, a person with a chemical imbalance in the brain. The crisis was caused by this imbalance after a successful voluntary taper, causing a bad manic episode with psychosis (i.e. a 'psychotic break', if you will).

I also take 100 mg of Topamax twice daily as a mood stabilizer, and the combination of medications seem to work like magic.  I don't gain weight at all.  However, when I had some blood work done, my thyroid hormones were low, and also my blood sugars were very high, even though I am not overweight.  I believe these are side effects from the Seroquel.  I do not recommend Seroquel, unless absolutely necessary for sleep, because there are too many metabolic side effects.",Debbie

Spent my whole life not sleeping well or at all lately (was up for almost a week a straight last year).  Quetiapine IR was a sure fire way of knocking me out within an hour and staying asleep to well into the morning. Pretty groggy though and had to keep increasing my dose.  My Pdoc recently sent the XR version into pharmacy instead and it is rather different. I don’t get knocked out right away which means I can create a better sleep hygiene routine.  If I am more relaxed I don’t need to be put to sleep but gradually work my way into it.

The anti anxiety effects kick in I would in a week or two maximum and the sleepiness is very intense in the beginning. What I don’t like about it, is that you get used to the dose very quickly and the symptoms return needing to either up or lower the dose. It’s not a super stable medicine. The first days of upping the dose you do feel more stable, calmer, peaceful but a week after you find yourself asking for more. Now therapeutically, it brings you back to earth, you know, but it’s not enough. In my case the lack of motivation is a big thing for me. It was so bad my doctor thought I had attention issues and wanted me to try Adderall and I said no because I knew it was from seroquel.
