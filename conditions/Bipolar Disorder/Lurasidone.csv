0,Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 28, 2022",0,"For months I suffered from anxiety/panic attacks EVERY day. I started having a lot of pain in my jaw joint and I went to the dentist, he told me I don't know how you haven't broken your teeth yet from grinding my jaw so much. I was suffering a lot. In an appointment with my psychiatrist I demanded my anxiety to be treated as a core problem because it was destroying my life. That's when he realized that it could be a side effect of the antipsychotic I've been taking for months: Lurasidone 40mg. I stopped taking it and my terror just vanished! Like magic! I'm in shock at how much my life had deteriorated because of it. I realized that I had developed akathisia - the suffering is so extreme some people resort to self-harm or even suicide. Bipolar meds are very strong, we need to be VERY careful with them and always question about side effects. I give a 2 because it helped me to be more awake.",Gab Conci

Every single time the same experience happens. I feel a particular unease in my stomach that's very hard describe. I will be in bed at rest yet I have this anxious feeling in the pit of my stomach. My mind has no idea what is going on. All I know is it happens every afternoon after I take latuda with food. My nights are ruined because of this drug. Valium or ativan may help sometimes but even thats not reliable. The feeling is so much worse than any type of anxiousness I've felt before. It's very physical and is confusing. Nothing helps, so once again I will go off the drug and deal with my mood disorder by myself. I have written a note to self, stopped taking latuda because of the unease, empty anxious feeling in the pit of my stomach, you can't think straight, words are hard to find and you just feel like hiding from yourself but you can't. This feeling last for hours until I finally fall asleep.",Never again

I started jogging every day for 15 minutes a day because I can wake up early now instead of lying in bed all day! I feel motivated, more able to do work. I do feel sleepy after taking the medication and can knock out right after dinner (maybe that's why I've started to wake up early). Hoping to return back to some old interests at a higher dosage. I think I need to titrate up to 40 mg, but the benefits have been great thus far! Haven't  lost any weight so far but hoping for it. Will update if anything changes ;) Love it!",stephedanimal

8,Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 18, 2022",1,"Latuda (lurasidone):Unfortunately, WITH insurance a monthly fill was around $1,400. Thankfully, my dad was able to cover the cost because I needed help and Latuda seemed to make that promise. Eating 350 calories with the medication was another hurdle for me. To combat this, I took it with dinner. HUGE MISTAKE. I found myself (a few hours later) having terrible racing thoughts. Many nights I had to leave where ever I was because they could not be managed. So, I began taking the medication right before bed and forced myself to choke down 350 calories. No more racing thoughts. Cut to a few months down the line…every few weeks when I went to bed I would get the racing thoughts again except much worse. I found myself with a fixed eye position (staring at the ceiling), racing thoughts, tardive dyskinesia, couldn’t keep my eyes closed, and I felt like a vegetable (drooling, paralyzed, etc.). Thankfully, I have since switched to lithium which has stopped all those nasty side affects! Never give up people!",Maggie

Four weeks in, I’m not impressed…I feel the negative effects don’t make up for the positive ones.Pros: I don’t get upset, I have crocheted more (because I feel bleh)Cons: I don’t get happy , I lost my libido, it puts me to sleep at 40mg…I don’t even get satisfaction from cuddling, touching my husband…almost repulses me, I haven’t gotten off the couch to do anything since taking it, it makes me violently puke if not taken at the right time after eating a ton, and it makes me sleepy so I have to wait until night to eat…Everyone is different, but I’m seeing a lot of flat effect on people, to me, I need some emotions…",Darktragedy

Latuda changed my life and made me more functional.The pros: clear headed, focused, makes me wake up early in the morning, helps with going to sleep if taken at dinner. My weight gain was minimal (5 to 7 pounds). I am in my mid thirties and walk every other day, work out 2x a week. I am 170 lbs. This drug helps me so much with suicidal ideations and boosts me. I barely notice the depression bouts anymore. My cycle is hypomania 10 days, 10 days depression, ten days euthymia.The cons: it doesn't work well for hypomania. I have chronic insomnia and I feel slightly lethargic. I'm at 80mg but will try to go down at 60mg again. I tried Risperidone and Seroquel. Both utter failures.Give it a try. :-) I hope this review helps.",david

I would sit in front of the a/c to cool down..it didn't work.  I felt like I had to ""go go go"" all the time.  The sweating left me with constant damp.

Then I was given 20mg which was increased to 40mg of Latuda, complete transformation to the person I used to be.  Woke up the following morning and walked my dogs at 6am. Part of it would be related wanting each new med to be the right one so I try to be hopeful and positive.  Latuda was a complete life changer.  I didn't relive each and every word, expression  and gesture from interactions.  Dwelling on every minute detail was no longer a daily part of my like. Self loathing for saying the incorrect thing during conversations.  If only I had thought to... It gave me the confidence to believe in myself wholeheartedly.  What a splendid gift to be given.  You are given your real life back. But I'm a women in her late 50's with arthritis so I need to be able to be physical.  Latuda's one side effect of muscle rigidity was debilitating.

I’m skipping my dose tonight and want to get off this. It’s horrible I experienced such bad akathisia and horrible anxiety I felt like I in a nightmare and I've only been on it for a week and I've never felt so horrible in my life. I have horrible insomnia and exhaustion at the same time but the inability to stop fidgeting. The doc even knew I was having these problems and prescribed a med to help but it didn’t and I only felt worse. And never gave me the information on it before I took it. Do not take this med until you dig deeper and find all the side effects. It works for some but sure didn’t work for me. Good luck everyone live a full life!",Kaela
22,Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorder,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 15, 2021",0,"Asked my doctor about this one after reading all the reviews. Was really surprised by everyone's experience and was hoping it would be the miracle I was searching for. Now I'm mostly jealous that it's worked for so many people but not myself. Was on 40mg and it just made me feel tired all the time and like a zombie. I have no clue how people take it in the morning because I took it at midday once and I was so incredibly sedated for the rest of the day, it wasn't great. It's definitely worth a shot if you want to try it, but be aware that it still may not be the right medication for you. There's definitely less side effects, but I couldn't handle the sedation any longer and got sick of feeling insanely apathetic after two months. Good luck.",Christian Mingles

But it was the other way around ppl take the meds but then hold on to their vices alcohol and drugs and then they counteract. But once again this drug has been a major game changer for me.

I still would get my manic episodes about twice a month that would last for a week, but it helped otherwise. I noticed an improvement with depression as well. 40 mg- I was suicidal upping to this amount. I had bad Akathisia. I had to take 30 mg of propranolol to make it slightly bearable. 60 mg- Major Akathisia and suicidal, I had to get off immediately Since I react to meds and they don’t work easily for me, I was fairly satisfied with the 20 mg. However, not anything higher because the side affects were too much. I also gained about 10 pounds on it.",WildRose

It worked great while it did but the side effects had eventually become too much for me. My biggest problem is productivity and motivation. This helped with that, I was going to the gym often, I was taking care of things like grocery shopping and laundry which I had problems getting the motivation to do. I had a lot less social anxiety and began meeting with friends again. I began to develop tardive dyskinesia. At night when I took the med I wouldn’t be able to stop fidgeting my feet and legs and during the day I had an intense feeling like I needed to do something and it made my feelings and my behaviors irrational and impulsive.

I know you aren't supposed to drink on ANY psychiatric medication, but even after so much as a glass of wine with dinner I would be overcome with this flulike fatigue...it would become taxing to walk, talk, even stand up, so I would immediately have to go to bed and do my best to get to sleep despite the internal discomfort.

It all seemed to be working well except on the weekends when I’d usually on eat two meals. I would take my Latuda at lunchtime and on 80mg struggled with the ability to keep still. I would just constantly feel the need to move around when lying down watching TV. This only occurred on weekends for some strange reason as when I’d come home from work on each weekday I’d eat something and take it around 5pm and usually fall asleep. No side effects no nothing. The weekends on the other hand became more troublesome and I requested to be taken off Latuda which my physician did but placed me on .25 mg of Risperdal. Bad idea. I couldn’t stay awake and was drowsy at work and had to leave work on two occasions. So I go back to see my PA and he suggests Latuda 60mg. Problem solved.

Taken over 30 meds for treatment resistant depression.  Put on 40mg latuda in psych ward this last September.  This med lifted a veil that had been obscuring who I was for decades.  Overly emotional sometimes. Aware of new feelings and emotions. Desire intimacy from wife often.  Have addressed a couple of serious character flaws I was oblivious to. Active and not in bed all day.  Working on dose with psychiatrist still. Using lamictal for moods and gabapentin for anxiety. Latuda addressed the treatment resistant depression.  I feel that once I clean up the wreckage of my past I can move on and begin a whole new life. I only have about 35 years left so I will make it count.

It keeps my mood up without causing mania. However, the key for me was in the dosing. I have always been more sensitive to drugs than other people, side effects are stronger, some drugs knock me out, with surgeries, anesthesia always makes me vomit, etc. I take 40 mg of Latuda and it works best. My doctor increased it to 60 mg because it's closer to the ""therapeutic dose"". That was too much for me. I was jittery, couldn't sit still, felt like a racing in my chest, it was a strange sensation. But when I went back down to 40mg, I was fine, and it's enough to treat my mood. If you're like me be careful of taking too much and find a doctor who is willing to listen about lowering doses. It works so well for me, my doctor gives me samples since I can't afford the high copays.",Ss

I started on 20 mg of Latuda in August 2019 along with my Seroquel XR and didn’t notice much. Then, about a month ago, she upped my dose of Latuda to 40 mg.

I only lost a few pounds after the switch to 80mg of Latuda. So, my Doctor and I worked on a trial and error program with a combination of drugs. Here's what's working for me as of now: 20mg of Latuda (makes me drowsy and that's about it...so I take it at night), 400mg of Lamotrigine (can't think of any side-effects), and 0.5mg of Xanax every night. I've always had trouble sleeping so the combo of Latuda and Xanax takes care of that. The Xanax also helps with the anxiety I've always had, the Lamotrigine keeps the mania and some of the depression away, and the Latuda seems to take the rest of the depression away. I've been stable with this combination and lost another 11 lbs. The biggest downside-besides cost- is the drowsiness I have during the day. A 20 min nap helps with that.",Steve

After that, my doctor took me off it,I still continued vomiting for another week. I had to go on a soft diet and still had stomach pain.I underwent an endoscopy, and several small ulcers and erosion was found in my stomach.
