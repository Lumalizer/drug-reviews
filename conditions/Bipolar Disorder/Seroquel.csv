0,Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 14, 2022",1,"I had depressive episodes all my life (I'm 55) and was diagnosed with bipolar II about 9 months ago. I have had insomnia all my life, but it became severe and unremitting about a year ago when I became severely depressed/anxious. Started on Lithium and then 25mg seroquel and went up to 100mg seroquel. It never helped my insomnia or my mood and caused constipation. I was on it for about 7 months. Big issue - now trying to get off and having major withdrawal problems. Mild insomnia, excessive sweating, severe abdominal pain. Something new every time I lower the dose by 12mg. I recommend staying on this drug only if you see significant progress. I wish I had been taken off sooner.",Bipolar II
1,Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 10, 2022",0,"I was put on this a second time around and helped a lot. It stopped working so it seems. I have been having increased anxiety a few hours after taking it for bed which leads into panic attacks for the past month. I have terrible insomnia and was going through a manic episode over summer Of 2021 and tried Depakote prior which did nothing and even tried Latuda which gave me twitches. The seroquel knocked me out and made me sleep so good along with clonazepam. I even got it upped to 100 from 50 mg but noticed nothing and even stayed up all night most nights on 100mg. I’m so sad this seems to not work for me anymore so I’ll give it a 5/10 because it works but then it stopped. I didn’t gain weight, sex was fine, just did it’s job with controlling manic episodes and panic attacks and insomnia for me. Wish one pill did wonders for me.",Bstevenrrr
2,Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 8, 2022",0,"As a teen I was on a lot of mood stabilizers. I stopped taking them before as a child. Cut forward 10/13 years I've been really struggling controlling my thoughts and mood so I sought out help and they put me back on seroquel.  To my surprise the medicine had me pretty sedated the first 3 days or so and is slowly building up in my system. I feel so much better my mood is not constantly up and down, I don't have racing thoughts, I don't suicidal. I was iffy about getting back on it just because I remember as a teen trying to get off it, and the sleepless nights however I am very pleased with this drug right now. This is a fast acting drug that saved me a trip to the psych ward.",Nines
3,Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2022",1,"BP2, ADHD, male, 30yrs. Using quetiapine (w. Lamotrigine + mini dose Vyvanse). quetiapine helped me fall asleep like nothing else I've tried before. Wake up after 8h rested. First attempts I was very irritable day after, almost couldn't go to work! But that resolved when taken for a few days. Makes food taste delicious in the evening after I've taken it and I eat much if I don't go to sleep immediately. Still lost 9lbs (~5%) weight and was told it's a rare side effect. Less appetite daytime so I have to remember to eat healthy snacks between meals. Much less dry mouth and stuffy nose compared to other sedatives. Only use 25-50mg PM for sleep but helps with fatigue, concentration during daytime. Had bad experience at first so made me vary of trying again. BP meds are weird, they change the effects of each other so it seems to be worth to try again sometimes after failed attempts before.",Rodger
4,Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,,"February 23, 2022",3,THROW THIS MEDICATION AWAY!!! Honestly the worse thing to start.. I’ve been on it for years and now find out it’s caused my pancreatitis. In the past year I’ve been hospitalized 3 times due to it. I’m otherwise healthy and now may have ruined my pancreas due to seroquel,SRRR
5,Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 7, 2022",3,"I once rated this medication highly for my initial positive experience with it. I now believe that is only because it helps me sleep. Once I got up to 200 mg, I felt like a zombie and experienced some other concerning symptoms. When I expressed my concerns I was told that this was a ""baby dose"" and they intended to still increase from there. I disagreed. I have weaned down to a sleeping aid dose and intend to decrease from there and get off this stuff. It's terribly addicting. When I was at 200 mg I used to experience withdrawal like symptoms if I was accidentally late to take my nightly dose, splitting headaches, shaking. I've seen some say it can be dangerous to not have an exact time each day it is taken, but this was never expressed to me by the psychiatrists who prescribed me. This is not an opiate, but there's a reason some people sell this and call it ""baby heroin"". If you get prescribed it for sleeping, it did help with that.",lalalalala

8,Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 12, 2021",2,I’ve struggled with unmedicated bipolar disorder 1 for years. I have always been very hesitant to take antipsychotics because I happen to be one of those people that gets all the rare side effects. I took Seroquel for the last 6-7 months and at the 300mg dosage my symptoms nearly faded away entirely. But I didn't like the way it made me feel. I felt dumbed down and slow. I was in a constant state of sedation and could barely work. I didn’t feel manic or experience psychosis but I felt I couldn’t enjoy life either. I’m tapering down now and hope to try something new.,Bella
9,Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 18, 2021",0,Seroquel has been a life saver! I have taken it for over 10 years. I take 800 mgs at bed time. I can not sleep and my mind does not stop when trying to go to sleep. I also use a weighted blanket and a noise machine. This past month I went down to 600mg to try to lose weight. It was a rough month but finally made it with a few anti anxiety meds. Which I am off of now. Hopefully I can continue on 600mgs for a while. I don't feel groggy when I wakeup. Either by alarm clock or on my own. Seroquel is not for everyone. But give it a try.,Me too!

11,Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 3, 2021",4,Everyone is different and I’ve known people who Seroquel worked wonders for.  For me personally it did more harm than good.  It gave me insane heart palpitations and extreme hunger.  I gained almost 100 pounds on this medication.  It did help me sleep but that was the only positive.  I stopped taking it and feel much better and have already dropped 35 lbs.,Savanah
12,Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 22, 2021",2,"3 years ago I was diagnosed with MDD and was prescribed Escitalopram which pushed me into hypomania (but I just thought I'm happy again). I was feeling great but 6 months later AD just (suddenly) stopped working and I was feeling even more depressed. Then I was switched to Effexor, which again helped and pushed me into milder hypomania. Same story, 6 months later it just pooped out. My diagnose was changed to Bipolar 2 (doc increased Effexor and started Lamictal and this combo didn't work at all). Then I've tried Olanzapine and Prozac combo (in 7 days +4kg) so I quit. Then Paroxetine with Ladiomil (didn't work). I was desperate. I tried Wellbutrin, then Tianeptine - 0 change. Quit all, started Seroquel 300mg. In 10 days I started to feel depression is lifting. Added Lamictal 200mg to Seroquel. I don't feel hypomanic, just stable and starting to enjoy life again, getting better daily. I hope once I'm fully remitted I can wean of Seroquel and stay on Lamictal as a maintenance.",Bipolar girl 2
13,Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 10, 2021",4,"I was prescribed Seroquel for my bipolar. My doctor prescribed me an antidepressant (Mirtazapine) at first, because he thought I was simply depressed, but that sent me right into a manic episode. After that, I was prescribed Seroquel. It did end my manic episode but the side effects were bad. I had really bad and vivid nightmares every night, I struggled with that before but Seroquel made it so much worse. I used to wake in the middle of the night, scared and to my whole room spinning around me and cold sweat. The worst part is that I felt even more depressed than I did at the beginning. It helped for mania but didn‘t help at all against my depression. I feel like it made it worse because I was tired 24/7. I wasn't as anxious as I was before though. I had to get off it because I had to go to the doctors bc I literally couldn't pee anymore. That‘s a not so common side effect of anti psychotics. All in all, it did not work for me personally, but everyone reacts differently to it!",Namo

Recently diagnosed mood disorder, suspected bipolar II but not given full diagnosis. This is the first med I have taken for that (previously was on a couple different SRIs for anxiety and they were awful). Currently only taking 25 mg and will increase to 50 mg soon. I almost immediately have slept better, have improved focus and concentration, and not anxious. I also have noticed that I am less disoriented by noise. My mood has been really good and I’m so happy with the results so far, and am surprised to see improvements already. Medication is such a trial and error process so I got really lucky that this seems to be the right drug for me. Knock on wood that this continues.",Lola

Without this medication I probably be homeless in the street talking to myself on the corner. I've been at the average weight of 150 to 160 for the past 20 years my height is 5 ft and 9 in, I do think about the diabetes situation from the reviews I would have think I would already had it.

They aren’t necessarily super positive, but it’s nice to JUST have thoughts with no strong emotions attached.  It does leave me more sleepy than I’d like, but it’s so worth it to me.

It helped me to actually focus and listen during my therapy sessions and help put my life back together. I also desperately needed ADHD medication but could never go on it because of bad anxiety, but now I can because of seroquel! I did gain about 50 pounds or so and just a warning you most definitely will gain weight on this medication. But honestly it’s worth the trade off. It really helps me when I get the hunger pains to exercise instead of eating, because it’s a different type of hunger and your body just needs the stimulation. Also word of warning never try to go off this medication without a doctors help. I couldn’t access my medication for about a week and it was absolutely horrible.",Jordan

Last go with this drug was about 1 year prior so I thought I knew how it affected me. This time was much different. I’m terrified to take it every single night because I think (I know this irrational) I won’t wake up. I have a mini panic attack when I take it and around the time I’ve talked myself out of that one, I become sleepy…that starts my real panic attack and I feel I need to fight it. I didn't used to dream much but I have been having vivid BAD dreams; 1/2 the nights. My anxiety and anger are at an all time high. I used to be a cutter and now still unable to deal with daily life it would seem I have converted to biting my forearm. Also waking up the next day and going to work- people thought I was on drugs because I couldn’t process anything for the first hour along with weird shaky vision.

I’ve struggled with ptsd, anxiety, pmdd, mood swings, and bad depression for 8 years. I tried every medication out there, and none of them helped. I’ve been on this for almost a year now, and I recommend it to everyone. I cried my eyes out when it hit me just how much this medication has helped. I feel normal now, and everyone tells me this is what it’s like to be and feel normal, and to be happy, to be content with life. I wish I wish I wish I would have known about this years ago. I could have saved myself a lot of heart ache. But hey, everything happens for a reason. The ONLY downside is being tired. I have to  make sure I have extra time to sleep.

22,Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 22, 2021",2,"I am on several different meds (Vyvanse, Luvox, Lamictal, and Valium + Seroquel). Basically ended up in emergency room months later, for a few hours over a panic attack. Since then I have been put on Seroquel 100mg at night. No problems. I feel non medicated. I feel stable. No weight gain. I workout the same. Cardio is my thing no problem there. What’s weird is I was involuntary hospitalized before, Seroquel 25mg was my prn. I didn't like it in there. It like made me stutter not able to talk. Just be stupid. But for some reason the 100mg at night... it puts me to sleep. During the day now. No side effects... the 25mg makes me skeptical after my experience and other reviews but I think it can be helpful if you truly know what it’s like to be in and fear the next psychotic episode. This isn’t the dangerous medicine like I thought. It’s good. Try it  but insist on a higher dosage for sure",CJ
23,Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 8, 2021",13,"I was prescribed Seroquel for sleep and I was diagnosed with Bipolar II.  At first I was prescribed a low dose, but still couldn't sleep, so now the dose is 200 mg at night.  I also have ADHD, so take Adderall, along with the Seroquel.  What I notice is this.  If I go off Adderall, I get very depressed.  I did some research on this phenomenon, and found out that Seroquel is a dopamine antagonist, which means that it actually suppresses dopamine in your brain.  I also take 100 mg of Topamax twice daily as a mood stabilizer, and the combination of medications seem to work like magic.  I don't gain weight at all.  However, when I had some blood work done, my thyroid hormones were low, and also my blood sugars were very high, even though I am not overweight.  I believe these are side effects from the Seroquel.  I do not recommend Seroquel, unless absolutely necessary for sleep, because there are too many metabolic side effects.",Debbie

I find that taking my dose at this time significantly reduces the groggy side effects in the morning allowing me to wake up feeling refreshed and well ready and with the energy I need to start my day. I also do not experience the Seroquel munchies that many report to experience. I am not a doctor or a practicer of health and medicine, therefore it is not my place to recommend others to take this. It is also not my place to tell others not to take it. For me it had a very beneficial effect on my life and functionality. My experience has been positive but it may not be for you. Also everyone take your meds as prescribed. If you don’t feel a benefit don’t stop it on your own terms. Express this to your doctor. They know more than you.

When someone finally told me, I demanded they take me off of it, and the drooling and spasms stopped almost immediately.  And I was able to stay awake, and think more clearly.  And able to participate in physical therapy.I didn't notice any mood improvements and in fact I was incredibly depressed, but being in the ICU is traumatic, and I had a machine breathing for me, and I was trying to process having almost died.I would recommend trying just about everything else first.  I've told my doctors they're never putting me on it again.",Jenny

As someone with Bipolar Disorder who experiences severe depressive phases, two doses of Lithium Carbonate, Gabapentin as needed for anxiety, and Seroquel 150mg at night for sleep  is what is best for me.

I am Bipolar I and have been since 1984. It was offered to me for my depressive side, and I can tell you for a fact, it didn't help at all for the mania (except it did and does help with sleep). After suffering through severe depression for about 2 years, Seroquel was introduced to me at the hospital. I went through some terrible side effect(s) that included legs with uncontrollable twitching and with arms. I still have twitches with my left arm but not often. The other effect is with the libido. I have no desire for this anymore. Is the drug worth it? I certainly is for me; without this, I am a goner to the mania world.",Dave

So my employer is aware of my condition and we structure my workload, such that I do serious creative computer programming in the afternoon after the ""dulling"" wears off.  My advice is to take it all at 8pm and get in bed at 8:30 - 9:00.  Then you will be able to do normal work at 9am and complex work after noon.  Diet and exercise are key, because you have to manage the diabetes that comes with it.  If I feel depressed or manic, I might add 400mg and that usually fixes it, but that is probably risky.

If stayed awake more than 30 minutes after taking it , you will feel hungry , so if you are worried about gaining weight just take it and sleep.  Find your correct dose that works well , and remember good sleep equals good mood. If you feel sleepy the next day , thats if ' drink some coffee + 1 cup of water.

I normally dream very little, but this gives me very strange dreams every night that I can very clearly remember on waking up.

I have found that it eliminated the manic phase of my diagnosis, as well as anxiety. However, tapering back and forth due to side effects has made it difficult to make consistent observations and I have suffered depression and even suicidality as a result. What have others experienced on this topic? I understand bipolar disorder is a multifaceted illness and therefore should be treated from both angles. Are most of you on more than one medication in conjunction with seroquel? I understand I have also had a difficult time taking it as prescribed and this may have hindered my results.

351,Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,,"April 5, 2009",50,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar One about a year ago and originally took Abilify, until I realized it gave me severe anxiety.  My doctor changed me to Seroquel which I take before bed.  It did take a while to adjust to how sedating it was but it relieved me of my insomnia. However, I have been gaining weight steadily since beginning Seroquel with an insatiable urge to eat about an hour after I take my medication.  No matter what I do to lose weight - 15 pounds gained since Seroquel - I can not lose the weight.  I love the fact that it seems to work well with my body and cures my insomnia, but there's got to be something better for me that doesn't cause me to gain so much weight.",sagesmom2005

When I first took it I slept for three and a half days. Now it gives me this horrible urge to eat and I can't stop. A few years back it was lowered to 600mg (still a little to high for my liking) but it has helped with my bipolar and my impulses. It does actually help but avoid being on such a high dose.",MidniteToker

354,Seroquel,Bipolar Disorder,,,"February 23, 2009",60,"A word to the wise: A psychiatrist prescribed a small dosage of Seroquel (at bedtime) for me (25 MG) to promote sleep. After a short period of time, I noticed an overwhelming craving for sugar--pastry, candy, milkshakes, etc. During proceeding visits to my family physician, I learned that my sugar levels were rising steadily, something uncommon in my previous medical history. Eventually this rise in blood levels developed into diabetes. Once this cause and effect was established, I ceased taking Seroquel. I no longer have an insatiable appetite for sweets.",MCarey0608
