0,Levetiracetam,Bipolar Disorder,4,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 6, 2021",1,"I was on this for social anxiety and I went completely manic, spent a lot of money, did things I wouldn't have normally done. Was I anxious? No, not really, but it was scary not caring about the consequences of my actions.",emmaspam
1,Levetiracetam,Bipolar Disorder,7,,"November 8, 2017",5,"I was diagnosed with type 2 Bipolar disorder in March of this year. A few months later I had my first seizure, followed by a couple more in my sleep. I was then diagnosed with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and prescribed a regimen of levETIRAcetam 750mg tablets twice a day. Over the past 5months I've had positive results regarding my seizure disorder, although I have experienced an increase in irritability, hostility, depression and suicidal idealation. I'm in the process of seeing my neurologist to determine whether this is the best treatment option.",Zackurie
2,Levetiracetam,Bipolar Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 24, 2016",14,"A doctor first diagnosed me as bipolar in 2007. My mania was out of control from about 2009-2014. Incidentally, I had two seizures in 2014 and started taking Keppra. I have noticed the Keppra has also made a difference in controlling mania. I hope this works for others also. I had to mention it because I would not have taken Keppra had it not been for the seizures. I have not had any bad side effects with Keppra.",So and So

4,Levetiracetam,Bipolar Disorder,10,,"March 1, 2012",22,"I have been on Keppra (levetiracetam ) since Nov for seizures. I have been on Bipolar medications for 2 years. The Keppra I started has literally CHANGED MY LIFE! I am no longer in a manic tornado. The twister I call ""life"" has stopped. I move at the same speed as others now instead of challenging myself to be the best, FASTEST and efficient mover 24/7. My thoughts are no longer racing. I can finish the thought clearly. It took about a month to really stop stop noticing the wretched side effects of starting Keppra or levetiracetam. Well worth it. ",hisstessa

My depression continues but the mania is being tamed.  So far I really haven't had any bad side effects to speak of.,Susan Jarnagin
