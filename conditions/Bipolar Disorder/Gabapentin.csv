0,Gabapentin,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 23, 2022",7,"I have been taking Gabapentin for 4 years now. It was prescribed by my primary care physician in replace of the Percocet I used to take for neurological pain initially but I have Bi polar disorder, anxiety disorder, PTSD, and manic depression so it was a perfect fit for me on the mental health side. This medicine is a miracle drug for sure! I'm calm, I'm happy, and I'm generally always in a good mood. My thinking process did an entire 360 and I no longer have those negative obsessive thoughts throughout the day. I had tried so many different medications and nothing, I mean NOTHING helped in the past. I used to get Tardive Akathisia (a feeling of restlessness in the brain) from all of the anxiety/depression meds my doctor had tried to put me on. I recommend Gabapentin to anyone who is struggling with anxiety/depression and bipolar disorder. 10 out of 10 for sure!",Cece boo

2,Gabapentin,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 12, 2021",2,"I started gabapentin and baclofen two weeks ago. Having bipolar III and anxiety, I was very apprehensive about starting any meds. Reading down the list of possible side effects made the endeavor seem not worth the risks. After mulling it a couple days I convinced myself to try. So far things are good. Pain I had in my chest for nearly a year literally vanished over night. That pain kept me from working for a long time; I was polishing my resume the next day. The pills brought facial numbness down around 80% as well. Some back and neck pain still lingers, but it's improved. Really bad flare ups are rare so far, and only with a good deal of physical exertion.On the bipolar side, I'd be a little concerned about hypomania or, for some, mania. The mood lift coupled with your body feeling like it's twenty again could be a bit of a launching pad. I'm finding myself noticing some hypomanic behavior, but not much anxiety.Started on 300mg daily gaba, and 10mg baclofen 3 times daily.",Darrell
3,Gabapentin,Bipolar Disorder,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2021",0,I had high hopes for this medication after trying a lot of different meds with terrible side effects. First five days were good then I don't know what happen.  I started getting real irritated and at night absolutely could not get a good night sleep. Did not want to take any sleeping meds at night. So I decided to stop this medication. Its nice it works for some people but not me.,Sue

5,Gabapentin,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,,"July 14, 2021",4,"Gabapentin is the best medication I’ve ever tried, I’m 48, bipolar and recovering opiate addict.  My doctor put me on 300mg - 3 times a day for acute withdrawal from the opiates that I had been taking for 17 years, and a oxy addiction. It really did help instantly for me, I was sweating . Vomiting and cramps for like 6 months, working full time was a nightmare, I seriously was close to living on the edge, I had lost 36 pounds, everyone was shocked when they saw me, my dad cried so many times. Anywho, everyone has a story right. Please do yourself a favour, get on Gabapentin, I’m on 600mg 3 times a day now, off opiates yay!!! One thing I must tell you in conclusion, once on Gabapentin, never ever, miss a dose...I went on a trip and forgot to bring it, I ended up in the hospital with what I thought was a heart attack, besides that it’s freakin amazing trust me, try it.....the feeling on it is so calming too.",Anonymous

7,Gabapentin,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 3, 2021",17,I was prescribed Gabapentin for immobilizing pain with osteoarthritis in my lumbar. This was given just to ease the pain before I have ablation therapy. Within the first 3-4 days I noticed the pain lifting I can still feel it but I can actually do more around the house and in general without feeling like I can't handle it anymore. But then I started noticing my mood and concentration getting better and a big mood lift. I have bipolar 1 in fact I'm on disability just for that so far but none of the meds I've tried have done real great. It's only the first week with Gabapentin but I think it just may be my cure all med. Less pain=better mood that is obvious but I feel this doing so much more. I'm so glad my Dr. prescribed it. It has been almost 5 years since I was diagnosed and I've had multiple hospital stays. I'm really hoping this med keeps up the good work and keep me on my own two feet.,TommyOdin8686
8,Gabapentin,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 22, 2020",14,"By far not everyone’s experience but my brush with gabapentin was scary. I was only prescribed 300 mg per day. The first day I took it I felt sedated. Second day is when I experienced my first intrusive suicidal thoughts. This scared me but I continued to take it as prescribed, thinking that with all the positive reviews here things would surely get better. The third day was spent daydreaming about my suicide. Fourth day had me thinking about death. By the fifth day these effects subsided along with any anti-anxiety effects the medication had on me. This is a black box warning for this drug, by the way.",Kippey

My highest dose was 400mg three times a day. As for anxiety, I felt it did absolutely nothing. It may have helped keep me asleep for a night or two only after having to drink a couple of beers to even get to sleep. As for alcohol, I was already tired of drinking beer most nights to get sleepy so I don’t think it really added much to that. Without it, I drink even less now because that doesn’t even help with sleep. Over all this drug was useless.",Jarbles

My rapid cycling is normally so bad that I can’t think straight and have a lot of episodes. I’ve been on gabapentin for a month and I legitimately have not felt so stable in my life. I only take 600mg daily spread throughout the day along with lamictal, buspar, and vraylar. It really feels like I can think and rationalize now, like someone who isn’t experiencing the severity of the disorder I have. I feel relatively bipolar symptom free and this is the first medication in 6 years that has done that for me. If you have hard to treat bipolar and have tried a lot, I recommend considering gabapentin as an adjunctive.

It doesn’t make me say things out of character like a drugs or alcohol , it can help me I guess relax enough to be at ease. I don’t use it everyday, but when I do use it I often learn something about being more gentle, or an ability to be patient and make an effort to have solid conversation. I don’t get a feeling like an opioid, I don’t take it after work like some kind of cure all but I will take it if I’m looking to be my least bound up self.

Not free of pain but the severity and duration is manageable with Gabapentin on board. Only downfall is short half-life so multiple doses during the day and can feel some irritability creep in if I go too long between doses, overnight can fall into that category if sleep too long.

At any rate, Gabapentin has been helpful to me for many symptoms, from mood stabilizer, chronic pain, & essential tremors.

Those were my wild days and was hospitalized. My family was convinced by a counsellor that I was an alcoholic which I wasn’t) so sent off to rehab. The rehab took me 100% off this drug and the withdrawals where horrible and it was 6 days of hell. Since then I’ve tried I think every drug out there with little help from all but lamictal and benzodiazepines. About 2 months ago my psych told me I was so severe he didn’t know what to do. I recommended let’s try Gabapentin and he agreed to try it. It has been wonderful and has helped me leave the house and cut down on benzos. Currently I take 300mg 6x a day.

I was diagnosed bipolar about 7 months ago. I have also tried many mood stabilizers, I feel like lamictal kinda helps so I stay on it. Maybe it is helping with my depression, it’s kind of hard to tell because maybe I’m just in a better place. I recently started gabapentin 300 mg 3 times a day. It’s only been 3 days but I feel like it may be helping. My psych was hesitant to give it to me as he stated he has never prescribed it before. Thankfully I do my own research and usually suggest what I want to try. Anyways hopefully this dose works for me and I can post back in a week or so commenting on the status of how I feel.

My psychiatrist tried numerous SSRI and SNRI with no impact on my depression and each of these types of drugs caused a severe anxiety disorder to manifest itself. I did extensive research on my own and found that for some people, gabapentin works for depression. I suggested this to my doctor and he was open to it. At first he started me on a very low dose of 300 mg daily. This had zero impact. We began titrating up until my current dose of 800 msg 3x daily. He was initially resistant to prescribe this dose of gabapentin but I really pushed to try this high dose. Lo and behold, gabapentin at this dose has made a MAJOR difference on my depression. The only warning I would give is that if I miss even 24 hours of my daily dose of gabapentin, my depression immediately begins to return and if I miss two days, I’m a total mess.",CBA

The constant hurricane of thoughts in my head, good or bad, caused an inhibition of social ability so I could never be comfortable in any given social situation.

Yea, it makes you feel a little loopy for the first few weeks, but after that it does a wonderful job calming the nerves. One day I decided to go off it and the next day I had insane mood swings until I started it back up 2 days later and then it was like night and day. So that's how I know this stuff works. While I was off it, I threw my back out and after going back on it my back pain was virtually gone. Killed two birds with one stone. It does make my face more oily than normal along with minor fatigue and added hunger, but other than that I love it.",Pete7189

Angry most of the time.  Irritable.  Unhappy.  Finally getting off gabapentin.  Didn't help mood (made it worse), didn't help anxiety (I had to take more Ativan).

A couple years ago I started taking gabapentin for a herniated disk. I immediately noticed a feel good feeling. That is now the main reason I continue to take it.  People are warned to not stop taking this abruptly..THEY MEAN IT! I recently had surgery to remove my fibroids and I stopped taking gabapentin due to all the other medicines I was having to take. Shortly after stopping abruptly my husband said something to me I didn't like that hurt my feelings and I THREW A PLATE OF FOOD AT HIM! I have never in my life done this.
