5,Vraylar,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 29, 2022",0,"So I’ve dealt with bipolar disorder since I was 13, they have had me on SSRI’s which to come to find out actually is worse for bipolar disorder. I went to the hospital after taking Latuda which gave me horrible intrusive thoughts for months finally landing me in the psych ward. Upon meeting my doctor I told him straight away I wanted to try Vraylar, and since then I have had nothing but amazing progress. My only issue is I have a low sex drive. Vraylar isn't supposed to affect your libido but it may have. All in all it is an amazing medication, I unfortunately may have to switch to abilify because I’m getting married and you lose all Medicade benefits and Vraylar  cost $1,299 dollars. I do highly recommend this medication if you struggle with bipolar disorder.",Vraylar

I was on seroquel for bipolar 1 and it stopped working well. So we decided to try vraylar the  3 mg dose was too high. I need more like a 0.5mg everyday, it would've worked then. I made me restless and severely afraid of explosions ( from the microwave and pool chemicals). Made me afraid of water too (taking a shower, washing clothes). I really wanted this med to work. Was put on buspar and propranolol to control the anxiety side effects. It didn't help . Citalopram made me less afraid of water and microwave explosions. I did lose weight with vrylar.

It has been a little over a month on Vraylar and I’m still experiencing the same side effects I was having in the beginning of starting it. I asked to be taken off of it immediately. I’m not able to sleep at all. Horrible night sweats, and rapid dreams. Yet I wake up early with anxiety. I feel very restless on this medication and no improvement mentally. It also caused me to have blurred vision, even with my glasses. This medicine just didn’t work for me. They switched me over to Latuda, so we will see.",Maria

I don't feel like a zombie, I just feel like myself again. I do still experience some very mild depression around the time I would usually have a depressive episode, but it is so mild compared to the past that I am far better off with Vraylar.

13,Vraylar,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 20, 2021",1,"Unfortunately, Vraylar was not beneficial for me.  I have a diagnosis of Bipolar 1 Disorder. In addition, I suffer from panic disorder. My doctor prescribed Vraylar to control both the manic and depressive symptoms of my bipolar.  I tend to be more depressive than manic, so my main goal was to improve the constant and debilitating fatigue, malaise, and general poor mental and physical hygiene that accompanies my depressive episodes.  I took Vraylar for six months and noticed no improvement in either my depression or mania.  I just stopped the Vraylar, and we switched to Latuda.  Latuda is geared more for treating bipolar depression.  I'm putting my faith in the Latuda and hoping it works more effectively.than Vraylar.  I'm not saying that Vraylar isn't a good medication.  I had no side effects from it; no tardive dyskinesia, akithisia, or other symptoms. Atypical antipsychotics tend to work faster than SSRIs, so you can usually tell in a couple of weeks if you are improving.",Dave

I mentioned this to my Dr and she said I could have stayed on the 1.5 but I don't know how helpful that would be but I did get some more samples in case I want to try that route again.

I don't really have many manic mood swings (just a lot of horrible depression). It's definitely helped me! It didn't make me lose my sex drive & it also did not make me gain weight (like a lot of the other meds I've tried). It's controlled my pessimistic ways. Recently, I've been doing some research on Vraylar & I have encountered some other side effects like akatisia ,elevated liver enzymes & lack of concentration (which I was prescribed Adderall & it's helped me with ""brain fog"" which doesn't really let you concentrate on regular day to day things). Overall it has helped me out tremendously with the wicked depression & that's what matters the most to me.

Pros: stabilized mood, did not feel like a zombie, was actually happy, slept well and woke up rested, also helped with my OCD. Cons: occasional night terrors, developed a twitch in my arm. My arm would just jerk to the point that I would accidentally hit people or throw whatever was in my hand. Because of this my doctor took me off. No other meds worked and I feel like my depression was worse because I had actually found something that helped me feel ""normal"" and I couldn't take it anymore. I was off for about a year, the twitch never fully went away but it was better. My doctor and I have decided to try it again but add benztropine to help with the twitch since it's the only med that has ever really worked. It's been a week and I already feel better!

I was initially prescribed a 1.5 mg dose to lift me from of mixed state of severe depression and hypomania. Within a month I was feeling better. Since my initial dosing my Dr has raised my dose up to a 4.5 mg dose and I am currently on 3mg. At the time I started taking it was a godsend but over time I have begun to feel the side effects outweighing the benefits. I am lethargic, disconnected, quiet, restless at times. I feel as if I am half the person I used to be. I have a hard time falling asleep then sleep 9-10 hours a night and wake up feeling drugged and tired. I am currently talking to my Dr about lowering my dose or going off it completely.   Although it has its benefits and was good for my Bipolar 1 depression and hypomania at a time period I believe for the long term the side effects are not worth continuing to take it.

So we added half vraylar twice a week (on top of my mood stabilizer) and it seems to be helping! My rapid cycling between anxiety, agitation, depression immediately chilled out. Side effects were pretty mild - sleepiness, nausea and a strange sense of my brain feeling like a dead battery but after about a month I have no more side effects other than indigestion.

I have been on everything but nothing seems to work. I also have severe anxiety and insomnia. I take 10mg of valium 3 x day for the anxiety but when my doc took me off the Vraylar it made my anxiety unbearable at times. So I would ""smoke"" to help. Now back on Vraylar, back up to 6 mg, no real side effects. The anxiety is gone but I find I only need about 4 hours of sleep a night, even though I'd love a full 8.

31,Vraylar,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 10, 2021",28,"What I’ve noticed after reading all these reviews is nobody talks about how long the initial side effects last and how long until you can expect to start working. After so many drug trials that I know everyone can relate to I finally found Zyprexa and Cymbalta combo to stabilize me for many years until it stopped working and I started numbing myself with alcohol until that stopped working. Started with drug trials again. Latuda made me feel like I was crawling out of my skin for weeks so I discontinued it. Started Vraylar and started at 1.5 for a week which at first was awful with numerous side effects including agitation, loss of interest in everything, on and on. So I started tapering every other day and cutting the capsule in half for now. Started feeling better and noticed a decrease in my anxiety within days.

But 4 am every day? I'm not tired but not settled,  it’s not a calm feeling but a manic one. It has made me more angry, and I struggle controlling my emotions and attention span, and this has made it worse.  I actually felt violent urges - that’s it for me. I will never take this again - the lack of joy- the cold and clinical feeling I have. How irresponsible that not one of these side effects were explained to me. I'm an artist. I have to sit still. I have to stare for hours at one thing. I can’t be restless and do this. Making art is the one thing that made me calm.

35,Vraylar,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,,"April 10, 2021",14,"Vraylar was, for me, quite awful. I was constantly drowsy and foggy. I would go to sleep for 12 hours, wake up for four, nap for four, and then stay awake for another four before collapsing from exhaustion. I was also pretty nauseated. I didn't see any meaningful change in my mood.What most disappoints me about my experience with Vraylar is that it was really pitched to me as a miracle drug: few side effects, quick appearance of positive effects, etc. However, it was a nightmare for me, and based on online reviews, my experience is a very common one. I have to say that it honestly really reduced my trust in my psychiatrist.(For some context, I'm bipolar 2 with ADHD. I've been on a lot of different things, and found that overall I respond poorly to atypical antipsychotics. I've been taking Wellbutrin for depression/anxiety, and it's really worked wonders for me.

My mood swings and at times delusional angry outbursts are a thing of the past.  Intrusive thoughts and OCD were a huge problem for me and are now gone.  Most of the time I am happy and can actually focus on accomplishing even difficult tasks.  I have gained weight, I believe because I am no longer anxious, so I am exercising more.  The one negative side effect is insomnia.  I take 10 mg Valium before bed but still  wake up most nights at around 2AM and find it hard to keep still and fall back asleep.  So I get up and drink tea that makes me sleepy and then return to bed.  The drug has changed my life so I'll figure out how to cope with or eliminate this one negative side effect.",thankful

48,Vraylar,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 16, 2021",57,"TL,DR: Vraylar initially worked for my bipolar, then did not, now I have tardive dyskinesia, which might go away but likely won’t. Initially, Vraylar worked very well. Then it wore off and my dose was increased. This repeated until I was at the max dose of 6 mg and it stopped working again so I discontinued it. I was told to go off of it cold turkey due Vraylar’s long half life. That’s when I started experiencing withdrawal emergent tardive dyskinesia (TD), which per my docs reports should go away but it has not (she reports that 90% of patients experience remission of this). For me, this presents as uncontrollable mouth (lip) and tongue movements. I even went back on Vraylar to do a 2.5 month taper to help reduce my TD symptoms. While the TD severity had decreased, it is definitely not gone. While this side effect is rare, the impact is life altering.",Ezzy

By day 5, I couldn’t sleep more than 2-3 hours IF I was lucky. I’d wake up with chest and stomach pain filled anxiety. No appetite whatsoever. Felt like my skin was crawling. I tend to be fearful of starting new meds so I asked my doc if it was normal and he just I was experiencing my condition and not the meds. So, like an idiot I gave it another week. The problems only worsened. I cried everyday because my body and emotions felt so uncomfortable. The anxiety was to the point I couldn’t leave the house. All I did was want to scream and self harm (never had that desire before). I’m now three days off and the anxiety and insomnia are still very VERY real. I just want to feel better.

Short term side effects were stomach ache, shaky hands, and uneasiness, but they went away after 2-3 days of taking the medication.  I've noticed such an improvement (and so has my wife), that we only wish this drug was on the market years ago.  I would highly recommend this as an option for BP 1 if you have tried all of the other medications. LOVE IT!",Doug

I'm always nervous to start new medications so I just started it a couple days ago.  So far the side effects are making me want to quit taking it.  I was told to take it before bed but it makes my mind race so badly that I've been laying here for 3 hours and still can't sleep.  And I can't take it in the morning because it makes me feel drunk-tired and for lack of a better word, completely high.  As exhausted as I am, I still feel like I could take on the day without sleep.  Other side effects are dizziness, restlessness, shakiness, headache, upset stomach, intense hunger, feeling like I'm catching a cold, can't stay asleep, blurred vision (I'm typing with one eye closed), irritability, difficulty concentrating, and an intense manic episode starting about an hour after taking the pill, lasting all day.I'm super sensitive to meds and I really don't think this is the med for me ",Black Queen
