0,Risperidone,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,,"March 28, 2022",0,"Just took this for the first time 2 days ago at 2mg. I only took it one time and will NEVER take it ever again. I gradually got less n less in control over my mind and body. I was screaming uncontrollably and rocking and jumping uncontrollably. (The worst mental experience I've had before that is depressive episodes and anger episodes and I was always somewhat in control.) My heart beat so hard and fast I felt like I was having a heart attack and  I couldn't breathe well so we called 911. The EMTs said everything was normal but my heart beat was elevated. I was fully convinced I was dead or dying and hallucinated I was trapped in a cave and I could feel myself being squeezed by the rocks. I'm not religious but I pray to god I never go through that again. This lasted 4 hours then I was able to rest a bit but not sleep. Today I still feel shaken by the effects of risperidone and anxiety that that would happen again. I also take welbutrin, lithium, Lamictal, and spironolactone.",Kat

Before that, doctors were unable to give me a diagnosis because my symptoms are atypical. I suffered from psychosis and emotional instability. I was given a dose of 6mg in the beginning and it stopped the paranoia. I had a lot of side effects like sleepiness, flat affects, lactation, anorgasmia, weight gain, blurry vision, greasy skin, greasy hair. My dose went down to 2mg and it stopped the side effects, but I was still emotionally unstable, however no delusions. After 9 years I received lamictal and I felt a lot better, the depressions stopped, however I started having psychoses again and the Risperdal went to 3mg, then 4mg. I’m trying another antipsychotic now because of the weight gain. Over the years I gained 40lbs, especially when my dose went up.",Anonymous

It only got worse as the first full week I was on it I had zero focus, energy, felt confused at work. I missed the better part of two days of going to work.

I was on 80mg of Latuda and the side effects were driving me crazy, couldn’t get comfortable in the evenings, moving a lot, sweating nonstop in warm environments while others are barely breaking a sweat. So my PA decided that since I have obsession compulsive disorder he asked if I’ve ever tried risperdal. I said no but had heard of it. He started me off at .05 mg which didn’t sound like much medicine at all but after reading some of the reviews on here this seems common. So far I haven’t had any bad side effects on this medication, one night I didn’t sleep at all though but the next night I slept nice and hard. I plan on giving another review in about a month.

Not only did it turn off the anger, frustration, intrusive thoughts, etc it did too for love, loyalty, connection to others. All emotions gone. I didn’t even care about my boyfriend or my cat, friends, mother, father, you get the picture. I was nauseated, had trouble eating solid food, constipated, motion sick, very uncoordinated. I was having trouble doing my job, and my personal safety was becoming an issue. If I would have continued this medication I would have fallen, tripped, etc. I was weak physically.  I have a constant babbling of thoughts, it stopped. My mind was just blank unless there was an external stimuli. So did my urge to connect with others, I would only speak when spoken to.

I take 1200mg of lithium, 1mg of  Risperdal, and 25mg of Quetiapine. When I initially started the Risperdal, it fired me up with the same effects that I’ve experienced on previous occasions with antidepressants.  It also began to mess with my sleeping pattern. For example, I would constantly be waking up two hours before my scheduled time. The good news, however, is that these side effects which I endured were short-lived, and after 3 weeks, they settled down.

The down side -- It makes me lazy, I'm so chill now that I'm totally comfortable just sitting on the couch. I feel relaxed and balanced but without the anxiety I have no reason to get up and ""run it off"". The biggest and worst issue I have with it is the damn weight gain. I've always been super fit and thin but now I have a belly that I just can't get rid of. If the it didn't work so well for my mood I would get off of it immediately to lose my weight.

I would recommend trying this for severe psychosis. I also take 600mg lithium which seems to help my mood. I like to think that the lithium helps the brain from the damage risperdal can cause.

I take the generic version for Bipolar 2 and have been trying over 30 meds for 5 years. I used to take Seroquel and Divlaprox but they stopped working for me and I was too tired. My mood is the most stable I've ever been and I am level headed and clear. I take .5 mg every night and find this is a good dose because I used to take more and was very out of it. This helps me sleep but not be drowsy. Honestly, it's not perfect as I'm dealing with depression currently. I tried prozac but it made me suicidal/dissociate and zombie like and less like myself. Because of this I just recently stopped prozac but I plan to try other antidepressants with this to help my depression. Overall, I love that I mostly feel like myself again. I just want to care about life more now and be less apathetic. DBT therapy helps. Also, acne on my body/face from this but no weight gain so I can't complain too much.",Cara

It helped with her mood swings but the side effects are not worth it.  She has a bladder infection, bladder incontinence, weight gain (which upsets her and causes more mood swings!), plus it has slowed her mental processing speed (lower grades in school).  ",Mom 101

I would recommend using this medicine to treat acute episodes as needed and not on a long-term basis.",Anonymous

I was showing all the classic signs of bipolar disorder and after starting this in less than a day I was a changed person. My wife says it saved our marrige.

I had tried several medicines over the years and nothing helped what I thought was stress and anxiety. After I had my baby at 27 I thought I was worse than ever and assumed I had Postpartum Depression. I was surprised to be diagnosed as bi-polar. The medicine worked right away and I have never been happier. I am a better person, mother and wife now.",Anonymous
