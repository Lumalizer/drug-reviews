0,Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 2, 2022",1,"LAMOTRIGINE SAVED MY LIFE! In the span of 6 months I had gone through hypomania, depression, and a mixed episode. I was off the walls, irritable, impulsive, and eventually spiraled to rock bottom. Relapsed in my eating disorder and self injury, increased drug use, attempted suicide, and almost hospitalized an additional three times. Insomnia, crippling anxiety, panic attacks, and a sense of impending doom. Had an intervention and ended up seeing a psychiatrist where I was diagnosed with Bipolar II. I had been suffering for years and did not know it was Bipolar. Prescribed Lamotrigine and it pulled me out of the worst depressive episode I’ve ever experienced. Anxiety and irritability is minimal, depression is gone. I don't randomly cry anymore. Eating disorder is in remission. I’m finally stabilized and functional. I’ve had literally NO side effects from this med. I started on 25mg for two weeks then had a dose increase to 50mg. I can't say enough how grateful I am for this med!!!!",SignalDust

I still have a full range of emotions, but the lows and highs are normal now. At first, I had trouble with sleep and word recall. I also have had bloody noses since starting this med.

I can finally control myself and stay out of the E.R. I am able to study for my finals again. People don't drive me crazy.

3,Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 23, 2022",1,Lamictal (lamotrigine):I was on 100mg of lamictal a day for the last 3 years and I felt great but the depression came back in Feb and I am now on 150 mg of lamictal but I still feel down and very nauseaus.

Bipolar 2 for ten years. I also take 50 mg Topamax and 2.5 mg Zyprexa. At 75 mg Lamictal, my depression is stabilized: I have energy, joy, my emotions don’t feel fragile and overwhelming, I have confidence and think more clearly. But starting at doses of 100 mg and above of Lamictal, I become angry and arrogant, brash and oddly lacking in empathy. I can’t believe how much a medication can alter one’s personality: from caring and humble to hubristic and slightly mean. Watch this drug. It can be heaven or it can be hell.",kpeders2

After 1 year of no luck and my work performance in the tank, social life non existent, not respecting myself, and aquiring severe credit card debt, my psychiatrist and I decided to drop the lexapro and turn the lamictal up to 200 mg. Since doing that (5 weeks ago) my work performance has sky rocketed, I'm able to face my fears better and let things go at a quicker rate. I have had more energy than I can remember,  losing 17 pounds. I'm wanting to be the social butterfly I'm known to be and wanting to be seen in healthy ways. In addition, my marijuana desire has dropped substantially and my hair picking addition that I've struggled with my entire life has subsided. I am curious to see how this continues to play out, but I'm very grateful to be on the right track with only taking Lamictal. Hope this helps!",Anonymous

7,Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 11, 2022",0,"By far the best medication I’ve taken. I’m stable! I have hobbies, money and no debt from impulse spending anymore! No more failed friendships from the fall out with mood swings. I will never skip a dose willingly. This medication is truly an awesome tool when paired with therapy to live your best life despite bipolar diagnosis. I encourage everyone to give Lamotrigine a chance and keep an open mind. As others said, my medicine cabinet looked like a pharmacy. I was on three different medications for bipolar at one time. I am on just Lamotrigine at this point. I would never make a review about medication but this genuinely changed my life and I’ve taken a lot of medication. I promise you, this one is worth considering.

However, for the last 10 years - I have experienced severe lows where I neglect myself, the house ends up an absolute mess, my spending is really irresponsible and I skip rent without thinking of the consequences. I *know* better than to do this but my mind just crashes. I don't recognise myself as I'm usually a very tidy person.My GP put me on lamotrigine (lamictal) and it's helped a LOT. I feel like I'm more myself, I am showering, eating actual food instead of crap and I am tidying, working out etc. The difference is significant and I slowly manage my weight better too. Friends can tell when I've skipped meds because I am so different off them.Downside is I became prone to insomnia, but if I am strict with a sleep pattern/good sleep hygiene, I'm fine.

Now I'm a very successful person, have so many great relationships in my life and look forward to the future. If you're Bipolar 1 please give this medication a try. I think for the first month or so I was a bit drowsy and ditzy, but those effects went away. Only lasting side effect is dry mouth but that's easily treatable.",Zayz

This medication is great because it not only levels out my mood, it actually helps my depression and anxiety. I'm on 400mg a day which is the maximum dose and I have little to no side effects and no rash or skin issues. I used to be a non-functional alcoholic mess having violent mood swings... destroying my relationships and couldn't hold down a job. I now have been at the same job for 3 years, got promoted and got sober. Things that I never thought possible before I started on lamictal. My main advice- it is absolutely essential to start at the lowest dose possible and increase your dose very  very slowly. Even if you take weeks or months to get to a dose that works for you, go slowly and give the medication a chance to work.",L g
17,Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2022",3,"Lamictal (lamotrigine):A little over 3 or 4 months ago I wrote a review on this drug which I take for borderline personality disorder. I gave it a 10/10 however some things have changed my opinion on lamictal. First off, I think this is actually a great drug for mood stabilizing. I can’t remember the last time I lashed out or had a breakdown since I started taking this drug. I would say it works much better than antidepressants for me. However, I started breaking out with acne everywhere. Given that I’ve had very clear skin, this was a big problem for me. I think this can be easily treated so that’s why I am not rating it lower. Another thing is that taking oral birth control with this drug is pointless since it reduces the birth control effectiveness. On the flip side, I have no experience of weight gain. Actually I’ve lost about 8 lbs since I’ve been on this drug. I’m not sure if that’s the drug or if it’s that I’ve changed my lifestyle (which is probably what it is) but the main thing is that the drug has not caused weight gain.",Taylor

I am still on hydroxizine 40mg and Trieptal 300mg (never experienced a single problem with those two) , SUPPOSED to be taking Lamotrigine, but it honeslty felt like taking all the other medications. I was put on the medication because my doctor told me I was ""too manic"" (baked bread at 2am, cleaned the kitchen and organized everything I could). Day 1 of Lamotrigine 25mg, I slept for 20 hours, stared at a wall for a whole hour, and cried because I was felt funny and got nothing done. Day 2 of Lamotrigine 25mg, I took it a few hours before work, I ended up at work a lot, crying for no reason, my heartbeat was so fast and I felt high, and I had a terrible panic attack to the point where I was rescued out of the bathroom.

I still have rage episodes ( REALLY bad might I add) but they are less frequent, less intense and the duration is shorter. Can still feel full range of emotions, just in a more manageable way. Everything is a bit dulled which helps with my food/drug addictions. Nothing tastes or feels as good, but they still feel good! Just not overwhelming good, which works out great for me. Some side effects are it harder to climax, lower sex drive, frequent UTI's, and insomnia. Definitely worth the side effects for me.",Maddy

21,Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 9, 2021",1,I'm taking 25mg of this medicine on day 2 and the first night I took it the next day I was in a new place with myself...I slept 7 hours for first time uninterrupted in years.  I had energy and motivation for the day. My anxiety peaked and not one ounce of sadness or drowsiness. I have never had luck with any meds and this was pure luck.  I'm now on 2nd day and cannot not believe how much my body aches have leveled off from anxiety and depression.  I have not been diagnosed just yet with bipolar but after years of research I self diagnosed myself thru family history.  Boy I am grateful a therapist finally trusted me to try this medicine.  I tried Abilify and by day 3 knew it was not gonna work. On Lamotrigine I am still waiting to feel sad or anxious and it has been 2 wonderful days to feel alive not dead person walking.  I know it's not been that  long but I'm convinced this medicine has benefits for myself like no other.  I am praying that I can live a better life now and be able to stay on track.,Anonymous

Depression and hypomania came into my life during my teenage years and I struggle for more than a decade with this undiagnosed and untreated. After talk therapy and diagnosis, I was resolved to treat my illness. My first psychiatrist started me on a regiment that did not work and I had to part ways with her. My second attempt was a resounding success thanks to Lamictal and a great doctor. I have been taking it for about a year and have only had one depressive episode (it was triggered by a difficult event) in that time when I previously would have one at least monthly. The impact of Lamictal was very quick and I did not have significant side effects. I am currently on 150 mg daily and I am happy to stay on it for life if necessary.

I had no empathy, no joy, no happiness, no sadness…nothing, just dull and flat. It was AWFUL. I couldn’t take it anymore and took myself off and I IMMEDIATELY lost 15 pounds without trying (and have not gained it back).  I noticed I’d gained it but didn’t attribute it to the meds…I was wrong.

This may be exclusive to me, but I found it took the suicidal/self-harm edge off my depressive episodes, so much that I can’t even form thoughts on the subject. I realize this sounds ridiculous, but I have been taking this medication since 2016 and it’s been working ever since; it quite literally saved my life two weeks ago. NOTE that it is NOT a miracle drug, I had taken the wrong dose the day before because being in a bad place makes one forgetful. That aside, the side effects are more annoying than nasty to get used to, especially since I had the rare eye-related ones, but I’ve gone from 50mg to 350mg and my eyes are no longer fatigued, nor do I lack a sense of balance.

I started at 2.5 mg & felt great & 5 mg even better. At 10 mg became a little aggressive. Then tried 12.5 mg and hopefully 25 mg but I can’t get past 12.5 mg without wanting to rip someone’s head off! I cut that in half to 6.25 mg (1/4 of tablet). I am hyper, it makes me sometimes feel like I’m on speed but my head is clear & I’m extremely active now. I added 5 mg of buspar twice a day to take the edge off & reduce anxiety. Appears to be holding but wonder if I’m the only one sensitive like this.  I was diagnosed major depressive disorder & anxiety in 1997.  Been on Paxil & Wellbutrin for years but now can no longer handle them after first manic episode. Now I am also diagnosed bipolar 2 & ptsd. Thank you!",Teesabell
167,Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 27, 2019",9,"I started taking lamictal at age 18 years old for bipolar and  I’m still on it at age 21. Lamictal reduces the frequency and intensity of manic and depressive episodes. I’ve experienced less side effects on lamictal than any other mood stabilizer- antipsychotic Ive taken. The risk for harmful rash STS is present but rare (I think it’s 3 in 1000 people). This risk is reduced by ramping up slowly. It took time to achieve a therapeutic dose. Lamictal is less effective when combined with hormonal birth control, so I take a higher dose.  I’ve experienced depressive and hypomanic episodes on lamictal, but they were efficiently managed by increasing the dose or adding an antidepressant. (I take Wellbutrin and buspar for my total  drug cocktail). I recommend this medication because it works without harmful side effects (like weight gain and brain fog).",name

Always went unmedicated until my partner took his own life in front of me and quickly found my disorder overwhelming. I struggle primarily with ideation- but I also have some psychotic facets. Lamotrigine quietened my racing thoughts within the first month, delusions and hallucinations toned down, and the only suicidal ideation/downswing I've had since has been due to c-ptsd. I really cannot recommend this drug enough, it's been amazing for me to get my life back on track, with no sexual or weight issues- I actually have a higher sex drive and lost weight.  Now fellow bipolars: I know you worry about losing the manic aspects or being completely numb but this drug ain't like that.

My panic became so unbearable that I landed in the psych ward where I was diagnosed with mixed states, rapid cycling bi polar.

Having suffered from depression and rapid mood swings (hypo mania) for more than 37 years it is a relief and very validating to hear other people's experiences if even if all of them are not applicable to mine .  I experienced a severe depression with a suicide attempt 36 years ago. Since then a variety of medications have treated my depression quite well. I also found a loving husband and have a job I really like. Those external things can make a big difference too. I started lamictal 15 years ago and it helped take away the rapid mood swings  & lessened some of the stronger depressive moods.Thanks to all for sharing. Now I don't feel as alone,Ellie 1910

My only gripes are that there's a really bitter taste if it gets stuck to your tongue, the shape is ridiculous to swallow (It's like a pentagon lol) and my psychiatrist didn't know that there is more and more info coming out that suggests that it interacts with the birth control pill. My little one is 2 weeks old and she definitely wasn't planned. I took the pill perfectly too. Just a heads up :)",dncn4lyfe77
