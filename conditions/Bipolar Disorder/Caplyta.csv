0,Caplyta,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 17, 2022",0,"I started this Med a couple days ago.  I feel ok.  Extreme dry mouth.  Literally woke up in the night to chug milk, water & Oj.  That being said, I usually can only sleep 90 minutes per each time I fall asleep thru the night.  I’ve been sleeping 3-5 hours each time the last couple nights, and for first time in years feeling like I’ve had some rest when I awake.  For years crawling out of bed in am, I felt like I had had the crap beat out of me.The only side affect I’m worried about is the weight gain.  But I will continue to work with Dr to see if we can make a go of this.  I’ve tried many meds over the years.  This is the only one I have hope for as the others made me crazier, want to gamble and one had me so zombied I was going to Jack in the box every night for like 200 mini churros.",Fuh_Khu
1,Caplyta,Bipolar Disorder,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 11, 2022",2,Caplyta made my depression worse. It was like I was in a black hole for a month. It got rid of my mania for sure. But the crushing depression made it a really bad choice for me. I will never take this again.,Raychel

3,Caplyta,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 23, 2022",10,"Caplyta is my fifth trial antipsychotic, and the first one that has produced no side effects. I have noticed a substantial shift in my depression and mood. It has not completely alleviated all of my symptoms, but it is definitely helping. I take it in combination with Lamictal 300 and Divalproex 250.",Anonymous
4,Caplyta,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 12, 2022",7,"I’ve been taking Caplyta for almost a month for bipolar depression. I immediately felt better emotionally but have developed a perpetual need to yawn/take a deep breath and a tightness across my upper abdomen. I’ve also noticed tension in the front of my neck and chest. It is not ideal and I am constantly debating these pros and cons. I have more mental clarity than I have had in years, but I am aggravated by yawning or semi-nauseous.",Babyron
