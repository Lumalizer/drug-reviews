5,Sertraline,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 16, 2021",12,"23 yo female with BPD. Been on Lamotrigine 200mg and Cymbalta 120mg for years but the cymbalta became too sedating. Switched to Zoloft 50 mg a month ago and unleashed TORTURE. Seemed to work initially, less fatigue and more motivation, so increased to 100mg but I became ravenously hungry and gained weight instantly. Dropped back to 50mg and it got bad. Couldn’t fall asleep and my panic attacks, irritability, and mood swings came back. Suicidal thoughts returned heavily. Got so bad that a few days ago I called my husband while he was at work feeling like I was about to overdose on my medication because the mental anguish was unbearable. I felt literally insane. And I could go on for pages about the anger, the lashing out, etc. Stopped taking it today. I know two people with bipolar disorder in which the doctors prescribed Zoloft and it screwed them both up so bad. I want to believe this is a good drug but doctors seriously need to be more careful with its use in bipolar patients",Bella
6,Sertraline,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,,"December 21, 2020",11,"(50mg/day) It made a huge difference for me! I was in severe depression and anxiety before I started and it made me feel again. The first week is hard with very severe anxiety, but hang on, it's worth it! Now when I have a difficult time, I have the mental energy to deal with it. It gave me back who I am as a person. I still get very low, but it happens way less and lasts only 1-2 days. I didn't gain any weight (even lost some because of having energy to eat healthier), the only side effect is night sweats 3-4 days/ month, clear, water sweat, making me very cold and itchy, having to shower and change clothes at 3am. It isn't as bad as it sounds though. I also have vivid dreams and remember them a lot more, which is actually pretty cool. Doctors were very dismissive of me restarting sertraline (took it for anxiety previously), but I eventually convinced them, because for me that wasn't a big risk, and had good experiences with it beforehand, so stand up for your opinion.",a

I am diagnosed with Type 1 Bipolar Disorder and have severe bouts of depression and anxiety. Having taken sertraline for several years now, I would advise anyone starting treatment with this medication to be aware that your depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts might become much more intense in the first week or so. This was certainly my experience.However, hang in there! It will pass! Your mind is playing tricks on you. I noticed positive mood lifting effects and a reduction of my anxiety within 2 weeks. Please keep taking your mood stabilisers/anti-psychotics alongside sertraline, however, as I’ve made the mistake of taking it in isolation before and I triggered a manic episode.",Boris Johnson
10,Sertraline,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 18, 2020",20,"I’m female, 34 years old - Borderline, Bipolar, Major Depression Disorder. I’ve been on and off 50mg Zoloft for 10 years, only went off for a few months total to try other meds of all sorts (antipsychotics, lithium, other SSRIs, benzodiazepines) - always came back to Zoloft. It’s just the one that works for me. 50mg - no more, no less. More than 50mg makes me manic.   I occasionally need Ativan for anxiety attacks.  Zoloft doesn’t make any of my mental illnesses disappear. It’s just takes the edge off (Quite well,) and helps me cope and not fly off the handle. Without them I doubt I’d be here today! I have recently developed tremors and I believe it’s the Zoloft. But I can deal with it. I won’t probably ever stop Zoloft unless I need to for some serious  adverse reaction or something - I can’t go back to life without it.

12,Sertraline,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 18, 2019",8,"Started 25mg sertraline in the morning, about 2 weeks ago. Only negative effects I can recall were feeling tired and almost too relaxed at times, messed up stomach, along with on and off headaches. My doc then upped the dose to 50mg. Yesterday, on the first day taking 50mg I felt extremely tired, fighting sleep throughout the day. Later in the evening I developed quite possibly the worst headache I've ever had. Tylenol and ibuprofen combo eventually soothed it, but it was unbearable. Mostly in the front and right side of my head. Throughout the night I kept waking up sweat covered. Woke up with a slight headache, feeling all around hungover with no interest in food. Even coffee made me a little nauseous. Really hopefully this medicine will work and be worth these  awful negative effects. Going to continue..with Tylenol on n hand at ALL times. Work prefers I continue giving it a shot, and I get a boost of confidence from these forums they hopefully all will be good in the end",Absurd

I have had little to no negative thoughts. I wake up feeling okay. I am able to fall asleep without the voices in my head overpowering me. I feel good.

15,Sertraline,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,,"July 28, 2018",11,"Suffered anxiety/depression all my life. I am bipolar 2. Last year I first tried sertraline 25mg. I  bridged from 37.5mg venlafaxine to 25mg sertraline and after 3 weeks of withdrawal/ side effect, it started to work! My friend got me into apple cider vinegar (ACV) for good health. Silly me found out that eventually ACV rendered sertraline ineffective after a few weeks. In fact it started making everything worse again! I discovered the world of amino acids, 5HTP, St. John’s wort, adaptogens, nootropics, etc and tried medicating thru that. Lasted a good year before I found myself spiralling out of control again! Doc put me back on sertraline 25-50mg. Developed suicidal ideation and wanted to check myself in hospital, quit my job and let the world fall on me! I stopped taking this after a week and feel better. I highly recommend you look up over/undermethylation if you are experiencing mental illness, it has a HUGE play in your health! Can help decide what natural supps and pharmas will work best for you. God bless!",Spoiled chorizo

I subsequently incurred depression, suicidal states, vicious angry mania, irrational thinking and mixed states, almost another evil personality. It turns out I was misdiagnosed with severe depression and not Bipolar Disorder. It's been reported that antidepressants like Zoloft can make symptoms of Bipolar disorder worse.

The mood variations disappeared, depression decreased.From the negative side, it produced a decrease in libido, and an extreme decrease in creativity. If you are a composer, a painter, a writer, etc, you should, in my opinion, expect a possible and very pronounced decrease in creativity during the its use.
