0,Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 21, 2022",0,"Abilify (aripiprazole):I've been on 5mg of the generic version of Abilify for a few years now. I'm a 44 year old woman with ADHD & Bipolar Type 2. It's been such a lifeline for me. I'm also on the generic versions of Adderall (2.5 pills daily, 20mg) & Topamax (a mood stabilizer; 50mg mornings, 100mg at night) as well. I can't take antidepressants (SSRIs and SNRIs for example among others) all increases my suicidal thoughts. On a low daily dose of Abilify for 3 years now, originally for treatment resistant depression, the frequency of my suicidal ideations has drastically dropped. I was only Dx'd as Bipolar Type 2 just six months ago (in Sept of 2021) and then started on Topamax. I've never experienced a manic episode, but my depressive episodes last months to years at a time—with my ADHD masking it in social situations. Hypomania I have maybe 1-3 days at a time, 1-2x/month. It feels like you had a good day at work regardless of what's going on in your life (even if someone close just died).",TPC

I've tried numerous meds. Abilify was/is the only thing that works for me, to keep me even keel, not crazy emotional.

3,Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 10, 2022",0,I was prescribed this drug as a mood stabilizer. I took it for 2 days and felt very awful. I stopped it and after stopping became very confused. I couldn't focus and work and was making a lot of mistakes. I had to quit my job and put off school for I just could not focus. I am experiencing shaking and muscle contractions all over my body. I feel like I am much less bright and much slower since taking this drug. It did absolutely nothing positive for me.,Rxishenious

No side effects to report other than possible weight gain. I didn't feel that this medicine was helping in any way until I got off it for a month to try and see if the weight would come off. I fell into a major depressive bout for 4 days straight. As soon as I got back on it I felt much better, my depression lifted.

No, this wasn't my norm and it was obvious where it was stemming from. I had gone off other medicine cold turkey in the past so thought I would be fine. I wasn't. By a week in I hit a depression so bad it was nearly debilitating. About 4 days after that the insomnia started and I couldn't take it anymore so went back on the 5 mg and decided to taper slowly. I know everyone is different but please don't mess around with this drug. Go up in dosage slowly, go down in dosage slowly. The feelings I experienced when going off cold turkey absolutely terrified me and I vowed to never cold turkey a drug again. My doctor said my reaction was ""rare"". rubbish! The withdrawal symptoms can be absolutely awful. Don't do what I did. I've now tapered to about 2.5 - 3 mg and still going. Things have been so much better after going down the right way.",JCris7

7,Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 27, 2021",3,"Abilify (aripiprazole):Abilify was the cause of the worst year of my life. Massive depression and constantly comatose. I was like a zombie. I woke up in the morning thinking when do I get to go back to sleep. Suicidal thoughts were frequent.  My wife would frequently comment on how I wasn’t myself, how I didn’t talk anymore. I was a shell. I also gained 20lbs (I’m a skinny guy with a high metabolism). When I finally detoxed from the drug, I had energy again. My weight gain is now mostly gone and I engage with my family and am more present.

8,Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 27, 2021",3,"Abilify (aripiprazole):Instead of helping my depression, I felt trapped in it, unable to say how I truly felt. Unable to move out of that feeling, yet unable to fully feel it either. My irritability became worse overall. I would have even bigger breakdowns over even smaller things. The frequency was slightly less, the incidents were more severe. I developed tardive dyskinsia, and pseudo parkinsons after long term use. I gained over 100 lbs on this medication, 60 of which happened in the first 5 months. My dietary habits did not change in this time. My sleep and exercise was effected. Previous to abilify, I was very active and loved to walk and ride my bike. While on abilify, I became listless and disinterested in physical activities. My poor sleep became worse, and abilify created insomnia in me, which I then needed more medications for. The I began having memory and attention issues while on abilify, so I was prescribed adderall to help me concentrate. All of this, and I am better off meds.",Rachel

PTSD/GAD with panic attacks too.  I am 33 years old now.  In one week I felt balanced and calmer.  The longer I am on this medication the better it gets.  My mind is clear to focus on the positive productive things in my life that I want to.  I can actually get things done now and don’t get paralyzed as I did before.  I don’t cry anymore or fly off the handle.No nasty side effects - which I was very concerned about.  Only issue I had was a little pins and needles type feeling in the feet and arms but it went away after first few weeks.If you are unsure like I was for years about psych meds, try this one.  I cried tears of joy because of how quiet my mind is.  I never thought I could ever feel normal.

11,Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 17, 2021",2,"Abilify (aripiprazole):Abilify destroyed my mental state. I was prescribed Abilify during a hypomanic phase. In the first two weeks of taking it hypomania left but depression started. My doctor suggested to up the dose, it made the depression worse. I upped the dose once more. I have been experiencing depression times for many years. The depression I got from Abilify 15 mg is like nothing I have ever felt before. Worst 6 months of my life. Near the ends, every time I would take it, I was thinking that I am literally poisoning myself. I got off it late April. The change in my mood was immediate. At the same time I started taking lamotrigine (miracle - 50mg to start). I finally understood what normal feels like. Abilify gave me a 6-month nightmare.

Two weeks in I had involuntary muscle twitches, dyskinesia, and restless leg as well as muscle discomfort. I also experienced worsened tics from taking Abilify 10mg. Doctor put me on Latuda instead and that has been working wonders. He told me normally Latuda is a much better bet than Abilify as far as lesser side effects goes.

Honestly, Abilify did nothing for me. like I never even felt any sort of effects, and it was almost like a sugar pill for me. It was actually crazy, I’m so used to medication is knocking me off my feet so when I felt nothing different from this medication I was confused. Eventually, my psychiatrist said that he didn’t want me on prescription medications. He told me to wean off of them, but instead of weaning off I decided to stop cold turkey. I had absolutely no withdrawal symptoms, and felt the exact same as I did when I took the medication. Am I the only one that just didn’t get anything out of this medication?",Clove

I have felt a bit more manic than usual, but I was also just diagnosed with BP disorder about 2 months ago so I think I am more aware of it. The lack of severe depression and irritability has sincerely changed my life — even friends & family have noticed.

Two attempts to end my life in 2016 after my second major episode, thankfully due to pure luck the Emergency services saved my life both times I tried to kill myself. The second manic episode was triggered by sertraline (Anti depressant) that was provided by my doctor. Bipolar individuals have to be very careful when taking anti depressants. Anyways now in 2021 I had my 3rd major episode and ended up in hospital where I was given Aripipazole 5mg slowly working my way up to my current dose of 12.5mg.

Got 5mg aripiprazole to try and the side effects immediately started on the first day. I've got a sensitive stomach and the combination of those two meds made me incredibly nauseous. Then I got really tired, slept the whole day and felt like having a fever. But the worst one is the photopsia at night. I constantly wake up and when opening my eyes, I see pulsating flashes of light. During the day, my eyes feel dry and some pressure is there too. I think that this is just bad luck. Sometimes meds work, sometimes they don't. I will go off aripiprazole as soon as possible but I can see it working since I've experienced short moments of clarity.

I wasn’t depressed on it, I just didn’t care about anything. Even the people around me commented on how apathetic I had become. It made my fears of psychiatric medications come true.

I am now enjoying socialising and exercise again, and looking forward to starting a new job in a couple of months. It has also helped relieve the obsessional-style thoughts I was having.
