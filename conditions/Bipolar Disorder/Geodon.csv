0,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 5, 2022",0,This is my second review. I just want to warn everyone about this drug. I felt suicidal  because of my horrible experience of taking it for 2 months. I felt drugged on this medication my doctor went from 20mg to 80mg twice daily over several weeks. At 20-40mg twice daily I felt weird like I viewed life from a strange perspective and at 60-80mg I felt drunk all day long. I was crying all the time depressed and suicidal also very moody. I switched to asenapine and so far the veil between me and the world has been lifted but suffering withdrawal now. Terrible anxiety and trauma from this drug.,Drug is poison
1,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 20, 2022",0,"I have been taking antidepressants for approximately 20 years now. I normally find one that works well and am able to maintain progress for years until it just stops working. I take Geodon (20mg, CL62 Generic ONLY) at night, after eating at least 600 calories. The catch 22: I have little to no appetite, so it is often a chore to decide on something to eat in order to fulfill that caloric requirement. I say requirement because if I ever fall short of those 600 at night, the next day, I will have extreme anxiety (day-long panic attacks) & various other side effects. It took me almost 8 months of suffering to figure that part out on my own. I've also noticed that my caloric intake during the day needs to be at a similar level or the panic/paranoia/overheating/nausea will creep its way into my day. I just wanted to share my ""ah hah"" with anyone else who may be suffering through ANXIETY & other effects while trying to stay with an otherwise miracle med.",600 Cal Req

3,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 14, 2021",1,"Geodon was absolutely amazing for me. I have Bipolar I and was literally at absolutely rock bottom, dealing with intrusive thoughts and severe depression for 2 years. I had tried Abilify, Seroquel, Risperdal, Latuda (I take Lamotrigine, Intuniv, and Lithium). After 1 week, I feel like my old self! It is incredible. I would normally never leave a review like this, but it's honestly changed my life. If you haven't had success with other anti-psychotics, give it a try. Don't give up!!",Ray
4,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 1, 2021",0,"Ah, geodon. I was hopeful that THIS would be the one! I've read great reviews myself. I liked that it is weight neutral. After about a week on it though, the world started to seem big and scary. I noticed I had more anxiety and anger. Fast forward a few more days and the anger turned into full on rage. I actually was soo worked up and ticked at my psychiatrist that I hurriedly got in my car, drove like a bat out of hell to his office and left a very mean note that he's a horrible doctor. I'm glad I didn't see him because I wanted to punch him. I would have ended up in jail, because this is NOT like me. I couldn't deal with the aggressive feelings and wanted off ASAP.",Bsmom
5,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 29, 2021",0,Geodon has saved my life!  For the first time in my life I’m able to focus and multitask. I can get up in the morning and feel motivated. My job performance is the highest it’s ever been.  I’m not raging on my husband anymore and I’m so much more patient with my kids.  It’s only been a month but I feel really happy for the first time in a long time. No side effects. It’s really been magical!,Anonymous
6,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 27, 2021",11,"This is by far the worst medication I have ever taken for my bipolar. I would give this a zero if I could. I didn’t feel terrible at first but I noticed some mild paranoia and anxiety. I ignored it though because I was actually more motivated and able to get more things done and I was finally losing weight. I desperately wanted this med to work. The doctor increased my dose and things got bad very quickly. I was having intense delusions, the worst I’ve ever had. They were so bad that I would just start crying because I was so scared. The brain fog, memory problems, and dissociation on this medication are awful as well. I feel so out of it all the time and I even went the the ER because it felt like I had been drugged. My head constantly feels funny. I’m dizzy and lightheaded. My vision is blurry. Currently switching to a different med and dealing with awful withdrawal. Hopefully the side effects go away soon. Please take caution with this medication",Destinyhyme
7,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 11, 2021",6,"I'm 62 and many years ago I was given Geodon but I only took it for a week (and it was amazing how it helped my depression) but I stopped because I've always struggled with my weight.  Anyhow, 10 years later I'm asking for it in desperation since everything else has not worked very good for so long.  My doctor prescribed it just the other day 20 mg twice a day.  I'm already feeling better and I don't care if I gain weight this time.  However, my doctor told me to eat at least a half banana if not a meal close to the time I take it.  He also prescribed me a drug called Topamate to help with the weight gain.  I haven't taken any of that as yet because I'm concerned about the reviews I've seen.  But I most likely will try it for a month.",viktoreashorses
8,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,,"June 2, 2021",21,"Hi. I'm 40 years old and we've finally figured out I'm bi-polar and not anxiety ridden and depressed. I was put on Geodon going on 4 weeks now. As far as mood, its amazing. I have headaches, and last Saturday night my heart was racing and felt like my whole throat, neck and head was pounding and going to explode. I sat up the entire night on the couch so I wouldn't fall asleep because I was so afraid I was going to have a heart attack. I took my regular dose the following morning and it went away. I just now read online about consuming 500+calories when taking it. I wasn't doing that, I was never told to, nor was any emphasis put on the seriousness of eating enough each dosage. I would just love to hear if anyone else has experiences the severe heart pounding for hours. This medication is changing my life, my kids life, my husband's life and I want it to be great like it has been so far. Any advice or your experiences would be so very appreciated.",bettermom81

12,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 21, 2021",4,"I’m currently being treated for mixed moods and am taking this along with lamotrigine and clonazepam for anxiety. I have taken lamotrigine for about 1 year now with the clonazepam. These two were great for me until this year when I started having delusional thoughts (intense fear of someone abducting me, people reading my thoughts). I also experienced dissociation while driving when my anxiety was intense. My dr prescribed me 20 mg of this and after 2 weeks of being on it, I am starting to feel like myself again as far as emotions go. However I do think I’m in a mild state of mania during the day until I take geodon at night. I’m taking it at night since it makes me sleepy within a few hours. I do have a loss of appetite but I just force myself to eat. My obsessive/delusional thoughts are subsiding but the hypomania is still around. I also take trazodone as needed for sleep which has been incredible! For me, the positives outweigh the negatives so far with this medication.",Autumn

14,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 31, 2021",15,Worse experience ever. I was on it for about 3 years.

15,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 31, 2021",15,"Geodon causes horrible nausea and working memory problems. I can't remember what I'm supposed to be doing at work sometimes. I go into a rooma and forget why I'm there. I had to switch to one dose in the morning (I work at night) because taking two doses a day just made me too sleepy. Truthfully, this is the best antipsychotic I've been on (I don't like antipsychotics period). At least it doesn't cause weight gain. Risperidone made me a zombie, Latuda didn't work, Abilify gave me insomnia and Seroquel made me suicidal.",Mysteryperson

17,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 30, 2020",18,I've been on Geodon for almost a year now. Started it because zyprexa made me unbearably tired and confused and abilify made me insanely anxious. For the first three weeks I felt tired within two hours of taking it at dinner so I was going to bed at like 8 every night and waking up at 3 or 4 in the morning. I was also incredibly nauseous to the point where I didn't eat hardly anything for about a month and lost about 15 pounds. After that the side effects basically went away (about once a month I'll get the sleepiness again) and it's been great at controlling my symptoms!,soofqueen420

My emotions could and would have been on a rollercoaster, but instead they were controlled and I was able to make clear headed decisions. I was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2 after years of being misdiagnosed with ADHD and the difference in how I feel is life changing.

My psychiatrist says I am the poster child for this drug. No more mania. No more hospitalizations. I was able to finish my masters and have held a stable, professional position for almost 17 years. Happily married for 21 years. Two kids finishing up their undergrads and going on to grad school. I did gain weight, but I’d rather be a little chubby and able to maintain beautiful relationships, than worry about a few pounds.

This saved my life. I used to ignore this class of medication because of the stigma attached to it, but I’m glad I finally found Geodon.  20mg morning and night,  Geodon keeps me focused and present.  I don’t act out anymore at all.  I feel more patience and it takes a lot to make me mad.  Finally some peace.  Only downside is you have to take it with a lot of food which is inconvenient for my lifestyle, other than that, no issues.",Lisa
21,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 4, 2020",10,Been on it for a month and my mood swings are smoother. I don't feel as manic. But it doesn't get rid of the anxiety or low moods. I don't feel as negative. I don't experience intrusive thoughts as much. I did gain a few pounds and I do feel tired and weak.,N
22,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 3, 2020",15,"I've been on Geodon for several months now and I have to say the side effects that bother me the most is being TIRED/EXHAUSTION and EXTREME WEAKNESS!! Sometimes it makes me so tired I literally just can't do the day.  It is like my whole body feels like I'm surrounded by sand, but so far, this is the only drug that has helped stabilize my mood and helps me have a more positive outlook without putting so much effort into it. It has helped my paranoia and suicidal ideation A LITTLE BIT. I can definitely notice a difference when it starts to wear off. I could use a higher dose but I absolutely can not go up because of how tired n weak it make me.  I have gained weight but that's only because I'm SO tired that just going to work takes all I have :(",Kodi87
23,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 26, 2020",13,Geodon is a very fickle drug. Make sure to take it with food (500 calories). Sometimes it sedates you and sometimes it doesn't. I found to avoid eating beef and hot liquids with the medication especially hot coffee.  I take 40mg twice a day. Otherwise it works very well at smoothing out the peaks of mania and mixed states. Doesn't do much for depression or Anhedonia. I wonder if in a way it causes the Anhedonia by preventing excitation.  It doesn't mess with cognition though and makes you feel like you're not taking a med.  And I didn't gain any weight on it too!,Jay Pal
24,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 10, 2020",14,"I've had a very similar experience to the last post. Began taking Geodon for Bipolar disorder 1 and felt cured, energetic, happy. My depression was gone, as was my anxiety and I had much better work ethic. Fast forward a few weeks and the effects are subsiding. I upped my dose to 60mg but it's still not the same as initially. I've had some pretty low points. I'm hoping it still works to prevent manic episodes despite not having the antidepressant effects any longer. Considering switching to latuda, or adding an SSRI/SNRI to the mix.",Grace

Then after three weeks of taking it, it stopped working.  Now increasing to 40 mg daily.  I’m hoping that works but kinda nervous it’s not going to.  Just my experience for taking it for 3 going on 4 weeks.  The side effects I had were nausea, lack of appetite, shaking and some vision issues.  Side effects seem to be subsiding.",RJ

27,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,,"February 6, 2020",16,"I’ve been on this med Geodon for about a year for bipolar and bpd. I am on a dose of 160 mg and I take it all at night. I still have mania symptoms but the only symptom I have is not sleeping. A couple of weeks ago I was up for 60 hours non stop and this past week I've been getting 3-4 hours of sleep and have felt fully energized. The first time I took this medication I slept from 8pm to 5pm and was groggy for the 4 hours. I was awake before I went back to bed. I haven’t been tired because of it since, though. I also developed an acute dystonic reaction called an oculogyric crisis because of this med. I am on amandatine to stop it. This med has been a game changer for me despite this. I don’t get severely depressed anymore and my depressive episodes would be really terrible and my manic episodes would always end me up in the hospital because I'd go on a bender and overdose or I'd be up for days and be extremely irritable and cranky.",bernie2020

It has been the only antipsychotic medication I have ever used that has no side effects and no weight gain, and I sleep like a baby at night. 80 mgs at bedtime is all I take. This drug has totally changed my life for the better, and has blessed me in a hundred ways. I felt so much better after my first month on it that I went out and got a job at McDonalds restaurant and have been in management there as a trainer for the last three years. This drug has been a huge success with me when all others failed and I plan to take it for the rest of my life. I would highly recommend it at low doses to anyone. The higher doses cause horrible dizziness, so the lower doses work better. I have not heard a single voice in three years and Geodon has made a believer out of me. Bravo!",Anonymous

No suicidal thoughts. I don't have any complaints about brain fog either. I was in a really bad place, where it took everything just to go to the appointment and admit I needed something changed.

However, it's not perfect and I still have periods of mania and depression when I mess with my dose. I'm currently thinking about switching antipsychotics, mostly because of the horrible withdrawal symptoms I get each morning and night before my next dose. Mostly bad nausea and vomiting almost every day. I also go through periods where I literally cannot stay awake because of this medication (falling asleep in the hallways of my college classes, and while driving).

Couldn’t take the akasthasia. That’s about it. That was enough for me. Surreal.

On nights where I barely slept, I would wake up so terribly drowsy that I couldn’t keep my eyes open. This impaired my driving and made work and school really difficult if not impossible. My manic episodes remained the same, until I tried stopping the ziprasidone, in which they became alarmingly worse than I’d ever had them before.

44,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,,"August 1, 2019",10,"Worse anti psychotic ever. The first week of taking it was ok.

Then after a couple of weeks I was feeling so restless, I couldn’t sit still and was moving a lot and I hated that side effect. Then all of a sudden it would make me feel wired and I wouldn’t sleep well for days. Then one day I took the medication earlier and a couple hours later I had a severe panic attack that I almost called the ambulance. Never again will I ever take Geodon.

45,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 15, 2019",25,"I took Geodon for one year. While this drug did increase my motivation to exercise, I felt the side effects were too negative to continue using. It ruined my personality for some reason and interfered with my ability to make quick, witty jokes like I am normally able to do when not taking this med. For that reason, I did not like it because it turned me into a robotic, unemotional Stepford wife or something. It gave me such severe anxiety that I had frequent panic attacks and had to be treated with an anti-anxiety med to counteract the negative side effects of the Geodon. It made me have to frequently urinate or feel like I had to go at least every 20 minutes.

I no longer had the rage that had been bubbling under the surface for weeks  it had died down. I have rapid cycling Bipolar 1 but mania is my biggest problem. The only side effect I’m having is a hard time falling asleep. For sleep I take gabapentin, trazodone & last night I added in some benadryl to be safe. I’m sleeping 8 hours & waking up without an alarm but I’m now foggy in the morning. But, halfway through my second cup of coffee I’m fine and awake.I’m on 20mg twice a day & I’m hoping my psych will add in a third dose mid day because I feel like it’s wearing off a couple of hours before I take my evening dose.

It helped within a few days and the dysphoria, rapid cycling and mixed state stopped. I take 40 mg at dinner and it starts to mellow me out and drowsiness kicks in at bedtime and I am ready to sleep. Works wonders because sedatives were not helping my insomnia. This has helped me maintain a healthy sleep schedule. I wake up refreshed and remain focused throughout the day. I have lost weight on Geodon as it seems to be suppressing my appetite, but after med after med that made me gain weight I am ok with this side effect. I have had zero side effects from this med thankfully, but know some people that do. I would say it either works great or it doesn’t. Everyone’s brain chemistry is different so that is probably why. If it doesn’t work for you, hang in there. I hope that you find something as effective as this has been for me.",Dani

I slept a full 8 hours and felt completely refreshed and ready to go when I woke in the morning. Then at a dosage of 80mg, instead of putting me gently to sleep, it gave me waves of paralysis in my whole body and had me hysterically crying for my daddy and hallucinating. I was immediately instructed to stop taking it. I don't take it for my mood anymore because of that. I just take the smallest dosage to help me sleep.",ItsJuJu

I take it in the evening and still have morning grogginess after several months.  My doctor prescribed Provigil which really helps (although costly).  I take the Geodon in conjunction with Lamictal.  I have less agitation and find (at least my family finds) that I am much less hostile than before.

220,Geodon,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,,"November 29, 2008",63,"After my first major breakdown in which I was diagnosedd, I spent a year trying different medicines. I felt like a new (or like my old) self within a couple days, on this miracle drug. My dosages have varied depending on the other medicines (antidepressants and ADD medicines) I'm on. The only major side effect I've had that never went away (been on it for 7 years) was the sedation in the morn ing (I took my whole dose in evening). Now I take 20mgs 3x/day and 40mgs at bedtime, then 20mgs when required for anxiety. Right now I also take Wellbutrin XL and I'm titrating up on Abilify due to breakthrough depression. Geodon helps both mania and depression and I found it to be very weight neutral.",BandBMama
