1,Bupropion,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 15, 2022",0,"Ive been taking Bupropion for Bipolar II, (severe depression) for over a year. I started out on SR then moved to XL and now moving to immediate release starting tonight. Bupropion has definitely taken away severe depression (NDRI is the mechanism of action required for me), HOWEVER... this med has also come with side affects. Initially, ringing in ears (not bad, just noticeable), severe constipation (take 3 colace nightly), makes me sleepy so I take at night (complete opposite of what it's supposed to do), has brought on 2 near panic attacks on freeway overpasses (I was slightly afraid of heights now I'm terrified) AND, worst of all, I have lost all interest in life. My doc says ""your depressed"" and I said, ""nope.. not depression, just lack of interest in anything"". I really miss my exciting, fun life. I guess this is what being normal feels like? Happy to not being crying but not sure I want to go through rest of life this boring. I will see how the immediate release works now.",OK I guess
2,Bupropion,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 7, 2021",1,I have been taking this medication for 2 months now. I started off on 75mg for a week to get me use to the medication then went up to 150mg. I was very irritable and annoyed by everything. My doctor raised the dose to 300mg because I was still down. This made everything 10x worse. It made me cycle through huge mood swings daily. I would be okay one moment then sobbing the next and depressed. It also made me super anxious. I had problems with anxiety but nothing close to how this made me feel. I even had an anxiety attack at the grocery store and needed to leave. Then I would feel numb. I was never happy on this medication. What made me get off of it was I kept having days where I would cry all day and everything would set it off. I also started to deviate from reality. My husband felt like a stranger and my house didn’t feel like mine. I’d want to run away because I thought I wasn’t where I was supposed to be. This did not work for my bipolar 1.,Bipolar1
3,Bupropion,Bipolar Disorder,4.0,,"July 15, 2021",6,"The first week was awful. Then I felt pretty happy, weird but I didn't feel miserable and I still was going to the gym even on my bad days. I didn't feel the need to help my feelings with food. I was sleeping better. This week I can’t get myself to eat. I am having horrible on and off constipation. Now a month in  and I am so depressed this week I’ve been to exhausted and hopeless to leave the house. I feel EMPTY, with no motivation or care. Instead of feeling depressed, I just feel nothing. I don't know if it is because I’m not eating, a bipolar low. I just don't know. Nothing matters to me right now. I hope this gets better. It has been about a month and I just really want this to get better. On a good note I’m losing weight, the bad news is I feel like I’m fading away. I’ll try to keep updating.",Bipolarlow?

5,Bupropion,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 29, 2021",4,"Omg when I first started taking I was doing things I hadn't in years. I guess I liked the manic faze. When I swung the other way crying, agitated, obsessiveness is where I am now. Will definitely stop taking. Tired of losing control of my emotions. When manic I did loose weight but now that I'm depressed I can't stop eating. Not good for me.",Denise
6,Bupropion,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 24, 2020",17,"I have been on lithium carbonate for bipolar disorder for 30 years.  I always had incredible anxiety and debilitating panic attacks. I added wellbutrin to my regimen which I did not want to do initially, however it has worked so well for me I haven't had an anxiety or panic attack since starting. In the beginning it wasn't easy, I was losing hair and all kinds of crazy stuff for 3 weeks.  Once I got through that it's been fantastic. I would highly recommend this to anyone!  Major change in my life.",harley
7,Bupropion,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 20, 2020",9,"I was moving off Remeron about 6 years ago, having gained 30 pounds, and started taking bupropion at 75 mg to supplement my lamotrigine 200 mg. No real side effects, but also no real change. Then I got moved up to  150mg of bupropion. Sort of helped, but not quite. Moving up to 300 was a bit of a problem. I felt electric for the first two weeks, like I couldn't sit still and wanted to scream, and I was constantly uncomfortable in my own skin. I also kept having crazy vivid dreams and didn't sleep much. However, after those two weeks, I felt so much better. I was much better able to get up and on with my days, be productive, and generally get my life back. I will warn you: not usually suggested for bipolar, but my doctor and I discussed the risks. (I have since added other medications, though, due to life stressors and comorbid anxiety issues.)",humanperson

It may take a little longer, I will try to keep taking it. The only things this medication is doing is that I'm smoking less and wake up well. Well, I wake up wonderfully well and it's only in the evening that I get into severe depression. At night it's just anxiety, really dark thoughts and eating. I just want to eat during the night, until I fall asleep.",gameaosibriel

10,Bupropion,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,,"September 4, 2020",12,"Been on Wellbutrin SR for almost a year for bipolar 2 with severe depression. Suicidal and crying constantly. I've taken all bipolar drugs to no avail. Decided to try Wellbutrin and norepinephrine/ dopamine reuptake mechanism is one I require to come out of depression. It's been a miracle drug. I virtually have no side effects other than ringing in the ears but that's fading. Definitely does not take away my anxiety and I will sometimes still have situational depression but no Suicidal Thoughts and no severe depression. There's no way I will take myself off this. This is the only drug I am taking.Poops were amazing initially, now more constipated. Also I drink alcohol regularly.  Was scared initially because I didn't want to have seizures but guess since I don't have a propensity towards seizures the alcohol isn't causing any. Caffeine is no-go. Even decaf CBTL leaves me feeling super ill so I'm basically cutting out store-bought coffee but I can drink decaf at home no problem.",Not meme karen
11,Bupropion,Bipolar Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 2, 2020",4,"Bupropion worked just OK for my bipolar. Made me able to take care of my responsibilities, but the depression still remained. Plus, the constipation was RIDICULOUS. Didn't have a single normal bowel movement the entire time I was on it (~2 months). Plus, after about the first month, I started having delusions of being followed/watched whenever I went out in public, so I had to stop it. Psychosis is a rare side effect of this medication so beware!",Helios

13,Bupropion,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,,"August 15, 2020",21,"I was in a major depression episode for a year. Negative thinking and self image, hopelessness,  suicidal thoughts, numbness, staying in bed for days, not showering, tired but sleeping excessively.  I have tried: prozac, zoloft and lexapro. These medications made my depression worse and my suicidal thoughts increased. Wellbutrin regulates norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters (NDRI), while Lexapro, Prozac, and Zoloft works with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Started on bupropion 150mg and I was got hypomanic. After 2 months increased it to 300mg.  My anxiety was increased but as my doctor explained I have always been anxious it is just more recognizable. Many say that it has made them hypomanic and more anxious.  Bipolar II is more than just depression and hypomania. It also involves anxiety, mood irritability, compulsions, obsessive thoughts, and worries. This is when you start working on a mood stabilizer.",Anonymous
14,Bupropion,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,,"August 10, 2020",9,"The first 2-3 weeks on this med bupropion were kind of horrible. I barely slept because I didn't feel like I needed to and then I ended up being sleep deprived and I wasn't sure if I could handle being on it. However, ever since I got used to it I have felt that Bupropion has been more helpful than the other 2 meds I had previously taken. It doesn't cover everything and I don't think any med could, but like I said this has been the most helpful med so far. I didn't give 10 stars though because in addition to the rough start if for some reason I don't have access to Bupropion for 3-4 days I start to feel very unstable.",soup

About 10 years I was under treatment for Bipolar Depression, Seasonal Affective Disorder and General & Social Anxiety. I try different drugs (SSRI drugs has made me hypo-manic) until one day my doctor add 150mg of Bupropion to Depakene and quetiapine and suddenly everything has changed. At first I had body dehydration, restless sleep and bad headache for about one month but Day by day the side effects has gone and my energy has boosted, my anxiety has gone. I enjoy being socially active. My winter blue has gone. Depakene's numbness has gone. I try 300mg after 6 month but it gave me Heart palpitations. Now after one year I'm stable and happy at 150 mg and really really really suggest this drug to give it a try.Finally I want to thank the inventor of this medicine. <<Sorry For My Bad English>>",Mahyar
16,Bupropion,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 23, 2020",23,I have bipolar disorder 2. SSRI did not work for me for 10 years. I stay in the hypomania stage for most of the time. Laziness no productivity. Lack of realism. After I started taking Wellbutrin XR 300 mg. I started to be active but then I started phase shifting to hypomanic stage. After lowering dose to 150 mg it took 2 months now I can feel pressure and have a sense of focus and urgency and I am for the first time productive but with no depression after like 13 years. I cope with depressive episodes with only 100 mg of etifoxine (non addictive) .  low dosage is important for bipolar disorder. Wellbutrin saved my life.,Oussama

We started at 150mg some time ago and it must not have worked as when I went back we increased to 225mg. Still complaining of depression we later increased to 300mg at which point I started to experience unpleasant side effects (sleep disturbance, racing thoughts, anxiety). I can safely say this drug did not do its job and I am disappointed I was not put on other drug/s recommended by the literature before this one. It has taken me 6-12 months to work this out. Plus it is hideously expensive.",JBakes
19,Bupropion,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 7, 2020",7,So I have a history of Bupropion. I first started it in July 2019 for bipolar disorder and lasted only 3 days on 150XL. My doctor was sure that after months of other meds not working that this would be the one for me. It caused tremors in my hands and face and it was horrible. I then started taking Latuda 60mg. I decided for anxiety to start taking the bupropion again after my doctor recommended it. I started out on 100mg. I then upped it to 150 but it caused manic episodes. So I lowered it back to 100mg. It’s been very beneficial since then and it’s very helpful in my cocktail of meds. This plus Latuda and Zoloft have changed my life and all my anxiety is pretty much gone and the bipolar is under control.,K

Two weeks in I started having terrible anger and irritability spells to where I would just scream. After 17 days I had to stop taking it. The worst side effect I’m actually STILL having though since stopping is actually weight GAIN !?! I have even decreased my calories and increased my exercise to bring my weight back to normal but nothing is working! I’ve become so frustrated and my doctors are no help. Has anyone else experienced weight gain from this medication not related to overeating ? I am so desperate for answers :(,Riley
21,Bupropion,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 23, 2019",27,"I LOVE THIS MEDICATION!! After trying Lexapro which ended up not working at all, (I found out I genetically don’t respond to SSRI’s), my psychiatrist prescribed 150mg of Wellbutrin XL(Bupropion HCL). This is the only thing that was able to pull me out of a deep  depression! Before this medication I had constant suicidal ideation, and would always be upset/having crying episodes. I would hate everyone and everything. Even though I still experience a little irritability from time to time, I’ll take it over the symptoms I was experiencing before. I did have to bump up my dose to 300mg though eventually because I was still experiencing breakthrough symptoms on 150mg. This medication combined with Lamictal changed my life!!!

I found a doctor who SPECIALISES in this disorder and is up to date with the latest research findings in this specific condition. If you don't like your current GP or Psych's attitude, find someone else! I started a combo of Lamictal (AM & PM) & Seroquel (Only PM - makes you drowsy). I kept a daily mood diary & it took 3 months for my mood to fully stabilise.

I had been on it years ago and had done well until it started making me anxious. This time it completely stopped my impulsivity, my compulsive behavior and brought me out of the horrible pit I was in. It took a good two months to get me stable and I lost weight in the beginning.

I am overweight as a result of other meds & emotional eating, which I do when depressed- for some reason especially when someone else is eating-- it's almost an impulse. I have lost five pounds now and find myself able to turn down sweets, be satisfied on normal portions, and generally able to control saying ""No"" to mindless and emotional eating. I can see why this would help smokers- I was becoming addicted to food. This alone has made me feel optimistic, but it was only after a couple of days that I began to notice certain other behaviors changing toward my self but more importantly others who deserved better from me.

I lived with that for 19 years no medication. I hate medication, but after being in a 2 month slump of depression I decided it was time. My DR told me it might or might not work but it would help with that nicotine addiction so I was for it. After taking it 3 days I felt hot, different, and had a horrible date (she doesn't talk to me now), so I stopped. I felt good the next week but felt depressed again so I tried again for a few weeks and felt good for the most part except the anxiety just ruined my confidence and sex drive.
