0,Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 30, 2022",0,"NEVER use this drug.I was put on it while manic and psychotic and it destroyed my clitoris. It went from being a robust organ full of sensation to being numb, unnaturally soft and permanently flaccid. I haven’t had a single normal erection since using it. My orgasms are pitifully weak and sometimes even painful. None of this was ever an issue for me before I touched this vile drug. It also made me gain 14 pounds.Apparently the sexual side effects are known as PSSD (PSSD is known as post SSRI sexual dysfunction but it can also be caused by some non-SSRI drugs including antipsychotics). I still have the side effects despite being off the drug for 6 months.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",NM13

2,Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 27, 2022",3,"Hi. I'm on a relatively low dose and it's only been a few weeks, but I am starting to see benefit from this drug. My only negative comment is the fact that I do have a bit of an appetite increase... haven't gained weight yet though (granted I am already a bit overweight from all the other psych meds I take). I was discharged from the hospital after a manic/mixed episode and suicide attempt, I have to say that I am feeling a lot better on Zyprexa when in combo with my other meds(Note: I take several meds for various psych issues-- Depakote ER [bipolar], Requip [restless legs], Concerta [ADHD], Effexor XR [depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD], Clonidine [Anxiety, ADHD]). Here's to hoping I don't gain weight and that I can stay stable on a low dosage in combo with my other meds!",kellymcnamara1994
3,Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 16, 2022",2,This literally stole an entire year of my life. The absolute worst medication and experience I’ve ever had. It completely took away my personality. It took away every joy in my life. I was borderline suicidal. I have never been so depressed in my entire life. I would take a manic episode over the feeling I had taking this medication any day- and I loath and am terrified of being manic.  Thank goodness I finally advocated for myself and got off of it. Run away from this med unless it’s an absolute last resort. Even then I’d choose no meds over this.  I would rate -100 if i could.,Bpdreamg
4,Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2021",0,"This drug was absolutely horrible. I was prescribed it for treatment of supposed bipolar disorder. Within one hour of taking the first dose, I began feeling that I could not sit down or stand up. Down on the chair, stand up, down on the chair, stand up, on and on.It was one of the worst feelings I’ve ever had. Thank God that my niece was with me, and she called my psychiatrist on duty on a Sunday. He told her to go and get me a prescription for Ativan that he would call in to my pharmacy and to take 2 mg as soon as possible. Within 30 minutes of taking the Ativan, the  horrific feeling went away. I can only say that just mentioning the word Zyprexa makes me sick.",Wright

I am gaining a huge amount of weight but its worth rather be fat and normal mind then being skinny and agitated and nervous.

6,Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 6, 2021",5,"This was given to me for what I now know was benzo withdrawals. I hadn’t slept since the doctor stopped my medication. Well the doctor tried to say I was bipolar schizoaffective but that was not the case. Don’t ever take this stuff.  It really messed up my life along with the benzo. I didn't have bipolar I had medication injury. Please don’t take this you’ll be unable to get off and this has the worst side effects of any medication I’ve ever taken.

7,Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorder,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 1, 2021",1,"Oh, good old zyprexa. When I was in active psychosis it was a God Send!! It took my mania and psychosis away, leveled me out, I was able to SLEEP for once, and after being on it for a year I continued to sleep, kept mania away, and took a LOT of my anxiety and panic away. But I didn't realize it was slowly making me gain weight and in just under 2 years I gained 80 pounds.  I don't even look like the same person and my weight has not budged even since working with a nutritionist for the past 6 months. This medicine is a blessing and a curse. There's also an article out there from 2014 saying that zyprexa can cause weight gain 2 YEARS after it's taken. You read that right. Ugh. There's GOT to be meds out there just as good without the weight gain. I haven't found it yet.",Bsmom
8,Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorder,3.0,,"September 23, 2021",0,Zyprexa may be really good for some people. It stops illusions of every kind and if your hallucinating it's a miracle worker. Thankfully it helped. However once the mind is under control the amount should probably be lowered because of side effects. The brain will be adjusted and the need for it will diminish.,Annie o sulliva

I lost 2 years of my life to this medication. I stopped caring about anything. Stopped doing things I enjoyed. Stopped leaving the house. Could barely get out bed. Also gained 60 pounds. Medications all affect people differently. But this medication ruined me. I’ve been off it for a month and a half and I feel like I just woke up from a coma.

11,Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 29, 2021",6,"I got my prescription for this drug a few days ago along with my Ativan, Zoloft and trileptal. Ativan doesn’t have the same effects of this and neither does trileptal. I took this yesterday around 11 in the morning for paranoia and anxiety and within 30 minutes I started feeling like a zombie, I felt super restless and more anxious than I was before so I slept from noon yesterday until 5 this morning, on and off.  Even though I drank 2 big cups of coffee, I still feel sleepy and dazed, this also caused me to have odd and extremely vivid dreams last night and I feel angrier than usual! I woke up this morning screaming at everyone in the house for not taking out the trash, I punched the air conditioner because it was turned up too high, I cussed my boyfriend out for taking too long to say something when he called me on the phone, etc. I thought zyprexa would be a good medication for me at FIRST but it made everything worse!

14,Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,,"June 23, 2021",13,"I was put on this drug because the doctor thought I was bipolar.  Three years later, two psychiatrists have told me I need to get off of the Zyprexa ASAP.  I was first put on 15 MG which made me tired when I woke up.  All day, I felt drugged out and I gained 40 pounds.  I am now only taking 10 MG and am lowering my dosage to 5 MG to finally get off of this drug for good.  The withdrawal symptoms I have noticed from getting off Zyprexa are increased anxiety and difficulty sleeping.  The best way to get off of Zyprexa with minimal problems is to taper slowly.  I would rather deal with the withdrawal symptoms than being drugged out to the point I can’t function.  I also take this with another antidepressant and am convinced I had symptoms similar to serotonin syndrome.  Please use caution and only use this drug as a last resort option.  It has a black box label for a reason.  The long-term risks of staying on this drug include psychosis and medication-induced Parkinson’s disease.",Phoenixaz12

I used to have serious breakdowns every two years but I have a strong feeling Zyprexa is going to reduce or even put a stop to those occurrences. I am able to enjoy activities and feel pleasure and contentment. I feel as close to non-bipolar as I think I ever will.

I'm currently taking Trileptal, Trintellix and Zyprexa and I think the Zyprexa helps a little with the paranoia, but the real star is the trileptal. Zyprexa is causing me to gain a lot of weight as it effects your metabolism. I'm going to talk to my doctor about possibly weaning me off of it, especially now that I'm on trileptal. I will say it allows me to get a good nights sleep and I have no other negative symptoms besides getting fat.",crwdsrf
19,Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 31, 2020",4,"I take Zyprexa as needed for mania/hypomania. It helps me sleep and keeps me level though out the day. When I take it long term it makes my feet and hands swell and hurt a little. Taking dandelion leaf or hawthorn gets the fluid off so it’s not a big deal. When I do hit depression I think it brings me too low so one reason my doctor said I can use it as needed. I usually take it 3-5 days in a row then I’m good. My dose is super low .675 or 1.25mg the pharmacy had to order because it’s a pretty uncommon dose. I like it overall and think it’s helpful. It also helps the irritation and agitation associated with mania. It also helps anxiety a bit. Oh, another negative is it makes me crave junk food. I can fight it but it’s hard so I gained 10 pounds in a month when I was taking it everyday. Thank goodness it’s as needed now!",Sims

His Pychiatrist prescribed an extremely expensive drug, Zyprexa, then insisted he remain on it for 6 months then left the country. My husband ran track in our house, wore his ski parka even tho 85 degrees, took several family members to help calm him, on and on. He was uncontrollably crazed, When he developed smacking lips about 4 months in, usually permanent, we stopped Zyprexa triggering DT's.His Primary care doc stepped in and tried various meds adding up to 4 that completely incapacitated him. More crazy man, upchucking, couldn't get out of bed when beloved company visited. We traveled to Portland, Or., finding a good Psychiatrist who understood meds, put him on 4 other meds to calm him, then began slowly toggling him off the mess.

23,Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 30, 2019",13,"I had a horrible, 6-day experience with this medication Zyprexa. While it was prescribed to me primarily for sleep, which 5 mg was effective, it made my anxiety 10x worse with paranoia and tremors. It was the worst. It has been three nights without it now and I still feel it's effects of increased anxiety and a fog-like head. The physical symptoms ceased 48 hours post-Zyprexa. I took 20 mg of Paxil with this medication for anxiety and was noticing some improvement with Paxil alone. Zyprexa made me feel as if I was never taking Paxil AND take five steps backwards.

24,Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,,"December 5, 2019",54,"I have bipolar II and have tried multiple medications. Sadly, I have had to get off this medication because it caused me to gain 20 lbs within a few short months, and also made my thinking slow down. However, this without a doubt was one of the best medications I have tried. I was able to finally get some rest and didn't constantly wake up throughout the night. My depressive thoughts decreased, though they were still there sometimes, they were manageable. I was able to go days without feeling completely poorly. My racing thoughts decreased, and I felt like I could think without having racing thoughts, or having 100 ideas going on in my head at once. My irritation levels almost ceased to exist. I was pleasantly surprised to see after trying several medications, that this is one of the only medications that has worked on me. If you can get around the weight gain, this is definitely a medication that is a must-try. Maybe I will try this medication again in the future if all else fails.",Anonymous

26,Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 22, 2019",60,"Zyprexa was a life saver for me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and OCD last year. Took Abilify and became irritated easily, lamictal and kept forgetting things, then I started 30 mg of Prozac and 2.5 mg of Zyprexa combo. It instantly got me out of depression/ mood swings and helped me get back to school & focus a little bit more. I will say that I feel a little dull/ do not want to talk much & gained 25 pounds in one month being on it. No matter how much I workout, I do not lose the weight. I honestly love the pros of this drug, I can smile and laugh again. But I do not want it to effect my confidence and self esteem because I am gaining so much weight. I am now weaning off zyprexa and trying latuda. My advice to anyone trying Zyprexa- give this a try and expect the weight gain to occur, it will help reduce negative thoughts, excessive worrying & mood swings. Have faith, and try it, I really believe Zyprexa will help get someone out of their worst days.",Anonymous

29,Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 11, 2019",16,"Started zyprexa 7 years ago. I had never been happier. I laughed, enjoyed life, lost the paranoia - then my yearly physicals started showing my A1C was elevated so I started on metformin. I gained between 6-12 lbs/year(132-179). Now on a BP med. Suffer dry mouth & tongue edema. I take 25mg benadryl  every 4-6 hrs to prevent it. I've weaned down to 1/2 of 1.25mg every 3rd night. I'm ok as long as I don't go past that 3rd night. If I try for 4 I pay dearly. It's like I've been hit by a Mack truck-the worst case of flu ever. I take the missed dose & 24-36 hrs later I feel human again. This drug saved my life because I was suicidal but  also now I don't want to die of complications from the co-morbidities that I'm developing now because I can't get off it. The real kicker: zyprexa affects your metabolism so it's even harder to lose weight & if interferes with how metformin works making it less effective. Talk about a double edged sword.

If you are a parent, do not EVER put any child on this drug. Anti-psych drugs are 1000 times more dangerous than you can ever imagine. Same goes for Abilify or any atypical or typical anti-psychotic.

47,Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 25, 2018",16,My psychiatrist put me on 10 mg of Zyprexa and 20 mg of Prozac. He said those two meds are supposed to work well together. After two months I was still feeling depressed so he increased the Zyprexa to 15 mg. This has been a miracle drug for me. I fall asleep within 30 min of taking it and sleep very well except it is difficult to wake up in the morning. I set three alarms around my bedroom. One I have to physically get out of bed to turn off so it helps me get up. But that side effect is getting better after two months of taking Zyprexa. I no longer have ruminating thoughts or bouts of rage. My mood is very even. I have had some weight gain due to the med making me feel hungry all the time.

Taking Zyprexa was a last resort drug, and it worked great for getting me through that tough time.  When I started to take it, I could finally get a good nights sleep, I can’t even explain how good that felt after going so long with out it.  I also feel like it saved my marriage.  Now the downsides:  I gained about 40 lbs since I’ve started taking it 12 years ago.  It makes me feel hungry constantly and crave sweets.  Another thing is I am so unmotivated, it’s so frustrating!  Anytime I try to reduce it I find I get irritable and not able to sleep, so then I go back up again.
