I still have a full range of emotions, but the lows and highs are normal now. At first, I had trouble with sleep and word recall. I also have had bloody noses since starting this med.

1,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 23, 2022",1,I was on 100mg of lamictal a day for the last 3 years and I felt great but the depression came back in Feb and I am now on 150 mg of lamictal but I still feel down and very nauseaus. I am wondering If the dose is too high for me at 150mg and how long should I wait for it to work. I'm on the extra 50mg 7 weeks now.,female
2,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 18, 2022",1,"Dosage makes all the difference with this drug. I am a 44 year old female. Heavy set. Bipolar 2 for ten years. I also take 50 mg Topamax and 2.5 mg Zyprexa. At 75 mg Lamictal, my depression is stabilized: I have energy, joy, my emotions don’t feel fragile and overwhelming, I have confidence and think more clearly. But starting at doses of 100 mg and above of Lamictal, I become angry and arrogant, brash and oddly lacking in empathy. I can’t believe how much a medication can alter one’s personality: from caring and humble to hubristic and slightly mean. Watch this drug. It can be heaven or it can be hell.",kpeders2
3,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 15, 2022",0,"I was taking 50 mg of Lamictal and 20mg of Lexapro to combat BPD and Bipolar 2 symptoms. After 1 year of no luck and my work performance in the tank, social life non existent, not respecting myself, and aquiring severe credit card debt, my psychiatrist and I decided to drop the lexapro and turn the lamictal up to 200 mg. Since doing that (5 weeks ago) my work performance has sky rocketed, I'm able to face my fears better and let things go at a quicker rate. I have had more energy than I can remember,  losing 17 pounds. I'm wanting to be the social butterfly I'm known to be and wanting to be seen in healthy ways. In addition, my marijuana desire has dropped substantially and my hair picking addition that I've struggled with my entire life has subsided. I am curious to see how this continues to play out, but I'm very grateful to be on the right track with only taking Lamictal. Hope this helps!",Anonymous

5,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 10, 2022",0,"I am on the autistic spectrum, so I'm used to the ups and downs. However, for the last 10 years - I have experienced severe lows where I neglect myself, the house ends up an absolute mess, my spending is really irresponsible and I skip rent without thinking of the consequences. I *know* better than to do this but my mind just crashes. I don't recognise myself as I'm usually a very tidy person.My GP put me on lamotrigine (lamictal) and it's helped a LOT. I feel like I'm more myself, I am showering, eating actual food instead of crap and I am tidying, working out etc. The difference is significant and I slowly manage my weight better too. Friends can tell when I've skipped meds because I am so different off them.Downside is I became prone to insomnia, but if I am strict with a sleep pattern/good sleep hygiene, I'm fine. I get a little nauseous too but it's worth it for the positives, personally.",31. Female
6,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 7, 2022",0,"I can't applaud this medication enough. I've been on it for years now and it completely changed my life. Before, my relationships were a complete mess, I felt suicidal all the time and would have a mental breakdown at the smallest of things. Now I'm a very successful person, have so many great relationships in my life and look forward to the future. If you're Bipolar 1 please give this medication a try. I think for the first month or so I was a bit drowsy and ditzy, but those effects went away. Only lasting side effect is dry mouth but that's easily treatable.",Zayz

I take it along with Venlax 75, 2 mg rispirdal. I take 100mg lamictal in the morning. It is a life savior. My mood is better. I don't have mood swings. I started working out for the first time in years. I will open my work office soon and I don't have intrusive thoughts about reality anymore. Also, I am not dissociated anymore. It helps me to be attached to reality. The first week was awful. But after it, I started getting better. My sexual drive as a man is improved 10x ! And my libido too. Give it a try and wait until it works!",Dani
9,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 20, 2022",3,"I suffer from severe bipolar depression. This medication is great because it not only levels out my mood, it actually helps my depression and anxiety. I'm on 400mg a day which is the maximum dose and I have little to no side effects and no rash or skin issues. I used to be a non-functional alcoholic mess having violent mood swings... destroying my relationships and couldn't hold down a job. I now have been at the same job for 3 years, got promoted and got sober. Things that I never thought possible before I started on lamictal. My main advice- it is absolutely essential to start at the lowest dose possible and increase your dose very  very slowly. Even if you take weeks or months to get to a dose that works for you, go slowly and give the medication a chance to work.",L g
10,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2022",3,"A little over 3 or 4 months ago I wrote a review on this drug which I take for borderline personality disorder. I gave it a 10/10 however some things have changed my opinion on lamictal. First off, I think this is actually a great drug for mood stabilizing. I can’t remember the last time I lashed out or had a breakdown since I started taking this drug. I would say it works much better than antidepressants for me. However, I started breaking out with acne everywhere. Given that I’ve had very clear skin, this was a big problem for me. I think this can be easily treated so that’s why I am not rating it lower. Another thing is that taking oral birth control with this drug is pointless since it reduces the birth control effectiveness. On the flip side, I have no experience of weight gain. Actually I’ve lost about 8 lbs since I’ve been on this drug. I’m not sure if that’s the drug or if it’s that I’ve changed my lifestyle (which is probably what it is) but the main thing is that the drug has not caused weight gain.",Taylor
11,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 24, 2021",3,"I have Rapid cycling mood disorder and I've been taking 75mg of lamictal for over a year and it has drastically changed my life, for the best! I still have rage episodes ( REALLY bad might I add) but they are less frequent, less intense and the duration is shorter. Can still feel full range of emotions, just in a more manageable way. Everything is a bit dulled which helps with my food/drug addictions. Nothing tastes or feels as good, but they still feel good! Just not overwhelming good, which works out great for me. Some side effects are it harder to climax, lower sex drive, frequent UTI's, and insomnia. Definitely worth the side effects for me.",Maddy

Have tried lithium, SSRI's, and all types of therapy. I started Lamictal less than a month ago. Started on 25 mg and after 2 weeks, 50mg, the dose I'm currently on. I feel compelled to write this review because, for me, it's been nothing short of a miracle. I have never felt this happy. I feel so alive and awake, like the cloud of irritation and grey has completely dissipated, and I don't mean that in a (hypo)manic way. I felt the change almost instantly, and with 50mg, the mental clarity has increased.Really hoping things stay this way. For the first time in my life, I'm optimistic they will :)",Fran
13,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 18, 2021",1,"Lamictal was a lifesaver. I've been on it for a year and 3 months at 200mg/day. however I noticed that when I fall into depressive episodes it wouldn’t really help but when I come off of them, it keeps me stable for months. I take it in combination with strattera and honestly I haven’t been this stable and happy in my life. The major downside is the brain fog, memory issues, and stuttering/forgetting words, its worth it though",stability:)))

I was put on this horrible drug and titrated up to 150mg. The only things I noticed was that I felt like an emotional zombie and felt NOTHING. I had no empathy, no joy, no happiness, no sadness…nothing, just dull and flat. It was AWFUL. I couldn’t take it anymore and took myself off and I IMMEDIATELY lost 15 pounds without trying (and have not gained it back).  I noticed I’d gained it but didn’t attribute it to the meds…I was wrong. I also felt it didn’t help my angry outbursts whatsoever. I still got depressed as well. I REFUSE to take this medication anymore and I’ve been self-managing for years.

I met my boyfriend, am holding down a job, getting A's in grad school…all things I could not do 1 year ago. Don’t give up. It can get better. I take 100mg twice per day.

16,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 25, 2021",8,"When I was diagnosed with type 1 bipolar disorder, after coming out of my first and only admission for mania and spending months with depression that only came out a few days, they only gave me valproic acid which depresses me, quetiapine worked for a while, but I had to stop take it at high doses for constipation and rhinitis, with aripiprazole for 2 whole days vomiting, with cariprazine for a whole month with akathisia, and olanzapine only depressed me, and I saw that there was Symbyax (olanzapine plus fluoxetine) that in 6 days took me out of the Depression. I managed to change psychiatrists, I told him that I was still sleeping 10 hours a day and mentally dull with Symbyax, so I get prescribed 100mg of lamotrigine and 50mg of quetiapine which does not make me fat at such a low dose, and since then I sleep only 8-7 hours and I can continue with my life without depression, mania or drowsiness. Thank God they gave me Lamotrigine. I am from Spain and sorry if I made some mistake.",AFC

I was watching TV and and actually laughed! Titrated up slowly to my now current dose of 300mg.For ladies on BC, you will need to take a higher dosage than normal because the effects of the BC somehow negates the efficacy of lamictal.

21,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 3, 2021",1,"I started taking this medication about 4-5 mo ago.  Started at 50mg and worked up to 150mg per day.  I do also take 50 mg of Zoloft for depression and anxiety.  I've never been given a bipolar diagnosis, but I have always had a lot of irritability which the SSRI's failed to really improve for any length of time.  In other words I would spiral downward at some point in time on just an SSRI.  With Lamictal I've been very stable.  Irritability is way down and this is maybe one of the best effects of this drug for me.  Also, I'm much more even keeled now.  I don't have such extreme thoughts and the ruminating etc is way down.

22,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,,"October 1, 2021",3,"This medication has been a godsent. I was hesitant for a long time because my genesight test results weren’t compatible with the medication; nonetheless I gave it a try. I’ve been on Depakote before and that seemed to help, but would ‘dull’ me out, and I guess it’s hard on the liver. I’ve been on Lamictal for a month now and have slowly titrated up (25mg, 50mg, 75mg). My psychiatrist has me taking two a day, one in the morning and one at night before bed. I wake up feeling levelheaded and am able to think clearer than I’ve ever had before. It works well with OCD too. I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2, Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety, and Borderline Personality Disorder—so I’m definitely a hot mess. Aside from Lamictal, I take Prozac, Wellbutrin, and Mirtazapine—like I said I’m a hot mess. The only negative to this drug is rare life threatening rash; that comes from being inconsistent and changing doses too fast.",Cyrus

25,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 8, 2021",4,"I cannot say enough good things about Lamictal!  For years I struggled with lows that would keep me mostly in bed for a week at a time, then periods of being irritable and anxious. Zoloft didn’t work for me and adderall damn near was the end of me. I was drinking way too much wine to cope with my symptoms too (only made things worse, of course). After 11 years of trying medicines my newest doctor diagnosed me with bipolar 2 which was scary but a relief. The BEST thing about this medicine is unlike other medicines for depression, I noticed a change within 2-3 days. After being on 25mg for 4 weeks I noticed I was becoming irritable again so went up to 50mg. I’ve been on 50mg for almost 2 weeks and will bump up to 100 soon. After being on the 50 my irritability went away and This drug is a LIFE SAVER. I never thought I’d feel this normal and content!!!

26,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 6, 2021",1,"Started off on Lamictal about 3 months ago. I was having severe mood swings and was diagnosed with Bi Polar 2. Lamictal has been by far the best medicine I’ve tried. No weight gain, not severely tired. I would take it around 5pm after work, and be totally fine. What I did notice was that is associated with Stevens Johnson syndrome. My dr at the time bumped me up to 200 mg within 2 weeks (big mistake) and my body started reacting to it. I now have cystic acne on my face. The withdrawal from coming off the medication (because my side affects got bad..  Night terrors, cystic acne) were extremely irritably, lethargic, headaches) I’m talking to my dr about lowering the dosage because we all know that finding medication to fit is hard. I also wanted this medication in case I became pregnant",Erin
27,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 30, 2021",0,"This is the first medication I am taking for Bipolar Disorder. It has been half a year now and for me it works when it comes to rapid cycling and extreme depressive episodes. On 200mg, there were no side effects except some itchiness of the skin but there never were signs of a rash. Then my psychiatrist put me on 300mg since my lamotrigine levels were quite low. This was awful. Constant nausea with an extreme gag reflex. Back to 200mg and everything was fine again. My stomach is still very sensitive though and combining Lamictal with other types of medication has been impossible so far. So yes, for me (!) it works for Bipolar Disorder but it is hard to treat my other symptoms like anxiety, heavy dissociation and low mood in general. But this is probably due to me being very sensitive when it comes to any kind of medication.",Luna
28,Lamictal,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 28, 2021",7,"I have been on Lamictal for almost 2 years now and it's really helped (I take 250-300mg a day). I don't get manic episodes at all (apart from some mild hypomania), which has been a big help on my social life. I also don't get manic --> depressed crashes (because, no manic episode). The only downsides have been I found it doesn't help with my sleep and because it stabilises so well and I have always struggled with depression, it can keep me stable but at a very low mood. In those cases I have used it with an SNRI and felt much better. Also I had very few side effects (apart from sleep and feeling a bit head-coldy when not actually sick), and if I'm consistent with my medication can finally feel and function as basically neurotypical :) highly, highly recommend! and I'm so proud of you for looking into getting help!",mu99

I can almost nap on command. I take pleasure in things I had almost forgotten about. My emotions are coming back, I'm not 'numb' anymore. Let's hope it lasts. Only side effect : a rash on days 1 and 2 which went away on its own. I also feel just a little bit lazy, which is a welcome change in my case. No weird side effects like those of antidepressants.

I tried so many med combinations and although some helped I still wasn't me. I lived in a fog of doom and dread. Honestly I can say this medication saved my life. This sounds so stupid but after 4 weeks on it I was watching Conan O'Brien and for the first time I found myself laughing at one of his sketches (yeah yeah corny). BUT in that moment I knew the light had started to come back on. Minimal side effects and I honestly am 100 percent back to myself. I still have anxiety but the terror of that depression is gone.

Was binge drinking, exploding, being promiscuous, stealing from the supermarket and that was followed by two overdoses as I dropped so low. I was initially dubious about Lamotrigine but 25mg made me sharp as a tack. When it got increased to 50mg I felt horrendous for a couple of week's and almost stopped taking it. I can honestly say after being on this ""wonder drug"" for 6 weeks I have stopped ignoring my calls and even managed a short walk with a friend recently instead of shutting myself away.

I ended up having to be hospitalized.I am not someone who is good at taking medicine, I castrophize and make my self suffer unnecessarily. I finally gave in while at the hospital and started Lamictal 25mg twice daily and I'm thankful I did. Within the first 2 days my panic attacks eased, my racing thoughts quieted and I wasn't crying so much.

Images and delusions have significantly dropped. I have been previously diagnosed with a disturbing purging disorder, body dysmorphia, ADHD, and panic disorder.

Lucky to find the right psychiatrist who put me on Lamictal. In my country (Russia) not many docs are familiar with bipolar spectrum disorders treatment and even less prescribe Lamictal. After taking the first 50 mg everything changed immediately. I became calmer, more stable, feel much more comfortable in public places and in communication with people, more confident, more present, more relaxed.

Went through Seroquel and Abilify before finding Lamictal. Initially, it seemed to smooth out my mood swings so that I could greet the day and take care of myself without issue (I remember joking ""THIS is how non-mentally ill people feel?""). However, I began experiencing significant short-term memory impairment and realized that my mood stabilization also felt like mood flattening. I stopped being a self-starter and just felt no interest in setting any goals. My cognitive issues and lack of drive led to my losing my job. It's now causing turbulence in my relationship for the same reason: I never seem to want to do ANYTHING except maybe watch TV/movies at home. Hearing my boyfriend voice the same concerns as HR before my firing tells me that this medication may be wrong for me. Time to talk to the doctor. I want to feel like myself again, more than I do now.",Mr. Ray
