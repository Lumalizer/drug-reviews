0,Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 18, 2022",0,"There  has been tried many antidepressant medications for me, but venlafaxine has been the only one for me that reduces also general anxiety. Also bulimia symptoms are less severe. In 8 years on use, medication has been stopped for two times and after both times (in 1-4 months) my anxiety and depression got very bad. Everyone is telling about the horrible symptoms that appear when quitting Venlaflaxine, but I personally felt barely anything. I think it is very important that the good experiences are said out loud too, not everyone gets horrible withdrawals. It makes mouth dry, I sweat more and I am more sensitive for light but those are NOTHING when comparing the the nightmare my life is  without venlfaxine.",DepP
1,Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 2, 2022",0,"Venlafaxine makes me very hyper, restless and manic. I've gone off it once, I have never felt so physically ill in my entire life. It is awful. I'm on 375mg a day, as a bipolar and ADHD . No idea what they been thinking. I'd stay away, unless you really want a manic relapse.",Jen

No panic attacks either.  Think more clearly.  It does slow down my sexual response some, but okay with me.  I am over 60 years old.  Have been using for about ten years.",Phillyboy78
3,Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 16, 2021",0,"I've been on this drug for almost 6 years, starting at 75 mg and going up to 300 mg for the last 3 years. In my experience, the withdrawal effects do far more harm than any benefit from this drug compared with other anti-depressants/anxiety meds. Missing just one dose wreaks havoc on my sleep - night sweats, vivid dreams & nightmares, and extreme difficulty waking, like can be in dead sleep for 15+ hours. Within less than 24 hrs of a missed dose I get brain zaps (terrifying and unpleasant), body aches, and feel blurry/confused. Worst of all (even worse than brain zaps, which are awful) is the deep depression that comes with missing even one dose. Have been tapering off this drug with the help of a new doc and the effects aren't as severe but definitely still have a long way to go. Am writing this review in the hopes that it will help someone else considering this drug be more informed about how hard it is to withdraw than I was! It may not be this severe for everyone, but be cautious!",STM

5,Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 4, 2021",0,"I have been on Venlafaxine and Quetiapine for years and now have few side effects, the worst one being if I forget to take my evening meds I don't sleep AT ALL.   I then go through the following day with no sleepiness -it just feels like a slight hangover.  I put on over 6 stone, I was always between 8st 12 and 9st 2, for over 20 years,  I am  currently just over 16 stone, my weight went up very quickly, i went from size 10 to 22 in about 5 months. BUT the combination works for me alongside being aware of my moods.  Who doesn't like feeling better, more confident, more attractive etc ? But I can quickly go beyond this and become a danger to myself.  I take 150mg Venlaflaxine twice a day and 600mg Quetiapine in the evening both on an empty stomach.  I do drink with the tablets and have no problems.  I have had a number of different medications previously and this is certainly the best combination for me.",CATLADY
6,Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 15, 2021",8,"I’ve been taking Venlafaxine (150mg) for 6 years now and it has destroyed who I was as a person. I’m always tired which makes me have no motivation, which then leads to depression and ultimately leads to raising dosages until you’re fully dependent on it due to extreme withdrawals when trying to stop taking it. My psychiatrist and GP attempted to wean me off and I had what people call brain zaps to the point of feeling disassociated, which makes my bipolar symptoms get extreme. I was having nightmares when I finally was able to fall asleep because I was also suffering with 3 hours per sleep from being so uncomfortable in my own skin. This pill has a lot of warnings and stories exactly like my own, please do your research on withdrawals from it before starting it. I would never recommend this medication to anybody.",Invadeher
7,Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 4, 2021",9,"I have been using venlafaxine for about 10 years alongside with quetiapine, but at first my doctor didn't want to prescribe it in fear, that it will trigger a manic episode. The quetiapine was a lifesaver, but this helped me not using extra large doses of quetiapine in severe depressive episodes and it never triggered mania. The key is, to taper down gradually when you feel well, so that you can increase again in need. The same goes for quetiapine by the way.",Reka

13,Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 20, 2020",17,"I'm a 21 year old female and I've been suffering an undiagnosed bipolar spectrum disorder for several years. I finally got diagnosed about 6 months ago and I started 200 mg Lamictal which changed my life almost instantly. However, my depressive episodes were still fairly debilitating, although less intense than before. I started 150 mg Venlafaxine in addition to the Lamictal and it took about 7 weeks to fully kick in, and so began the happiest time of my life. These drugs saved my life and the Venlafaxine, especially, made me happy again. The only side effects I had were decreased appetite and lowered sex drive. I didn't mind the decreased appetite, but the low sex drive sucked. I recently doubled my dose to 300 mg b/c some life stuff happened that was bringing out my depression. It's been 1 week and it’s made my sex drive fly through the roof. I really hope this isn't a temporary side effect because it feels amazing after years of not having a sex drive from the depressive episodes",sampsy345

I did try to ween myself off to 75 mgs because I hate having to take meds daily. But with major depression I have had to go back up to the 150 daily. I have not become any better. I have become worse. I cry daily. I think about suicide numerous times a day. All of the above comments are 100% correct. The withdrawals are horrifying!,Super Exhausted Merchandiser

I've been on these 2 drugs, for a few years now after being sectioned twice. Without it I would not function. I was on several drugs before venlafaxine, eg trazadone etc but they didn't work hence being sectioned. Since being on this drug for a few years now am stable and have not had a hospital admission for my mental health which is a relief to my family. They are no longer out looking for me on bridges or train tracks etc. I could not function without this combination of tablets and go out shopping with my family and take my dogs out.

19,Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,,"December 16, 2018",4,"I was prescribed 150 mg a day. But I decided to start myself at 75mg. The first day my anxiety was super bad, I was shaking, didn’t eat, had to leave my classes because I was so irritable and couldn’t sit still. I got home and my pupils were HUGE. The second day I had a migraine, dilated pupils, shaking uncontrollably, nauseous, no appetite, random muscle spasms, lost feeling in my legs randomly, bad anxiety, chest pains. My migraine got worse throughout the day and while on this you can’t take many pain relievers, so I tried to sleep it off. After an hour I woke up. I knew something felt wrong. I had felt out of body for the 2 days I was on it but I had my friend rush me to the hospital and I passed out multiple times, threw up, still had all the same symptoms as previously listed. I was super dehydrated. The doctors hooked me up to an IV for a few hours to get rid of my symptoms. Not saying you shouldn’t try it but I would recommend trying something else before this.",NikNak

I have a love hate relationship with this medication. It has helped me wonderfully with my depression but the side long term effects make me hate it. I have become dependent on it. I believe It has ruined my short term memory. If I miss one dose, immediately after the next dose I get sick. I’m nauseous for the day, I have a migraine and the worst is the muscle and bone aches. My body hurts so bad. If I miss two doses, I become psychotic. I can’t speak normally. I repeat the same thing over and over. I shake terribly. I feel trapped in my head. I hallucinate. I get brain zaps too.  I’m terrified to come off of this drug in search of an alternative but I am at the highest dose and it’s not working anymore.  I am incredibly stable mentally.

He was prescribed it by his GP for cycling moods (later diagnosed with BPL and Rapid cycling Bi Polar). After a week he begun to run away from home, sat in the road in the rain,  ran away from work. (before he had held a job for 9 years despite awful mood swings). GP felt this was 'normal' and upped his dose. He then begun to plan his own suicide and was only stopped thanks to a security guard at the car park. He stopped caring about me or anyone else. He then two days later turned psychotic with a knife (we are taking about a gentle animal loving world peace advocate I might add).

If anything, it can make the mania worse.  I find adjusting my dose works the best.  So anywhere from 150mg to 200mg.  I know that is not the wisest course, but it does help keep the mania from being too strong.  Olanzapine also helps me.",chgoman

I know Venlafaxine is contraindicated in people who experience mania and I have had some issues with that but overall, with other medications that stabilise my mood, I have found Venlafaxine to be a life saver. I am 23, been hospitalised before for a long time and it was the first med I agreed to go back on after a period of desperation following a year of refusal to take meds due to extreme anti-psychiatry views. Now my anxiety is massively decreased, I feel much more on a level, less irritable, far less lethargic. This medication has done so much for me. No side effects apart from the initial week or two of starting it I got some insomnia and occasionally I get a very dry mouth. Sometimes a bad tremor.",Sezthet

Several years later after years of both manic and depressive episodes,  the worst  full-blown manic episode got me re-diagnosed as bi-polar. I was prescribed venlafaxine, a very small dose which made me violently ill for over 2 weeks, but after that, it improved and I felt better. My dosage has been upped numerous times.

33,Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 26, 2015",7,"This medicine was a God send for the depression. Shortly after beginning it I developed sores on my tongue.The next week my face began hurting and swelling, first at the jaw hinges, then up to my temples. The pain got so bad I couldn't open my mouth to eat. I realized I was grinding my teeth, clenching my jaws and flexing my facial muscles. Long story short, I am off the meds and on a different antidepressant. The 2 weeks of being off my meds nearly killed me (suicidal alcoholic). I now know that other medical issues combined with the drug to cause the extreme reaction. Please be careful with this medicine.

37,Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,,"May 29, 2015",18,I started on this after trying most of the SSRI's and Mirtazapine. Only the Mirtazapine worked for my mood but I had horrific side effects with it so doctor suggested Venlafaxine. I started on 37.5mg twice a day and got quite bad nausea for about a week. After that had gone it was great. My mood dropped a bit from being happy on Mirtazapine to being on such a low dose of Venlafaxine but now I'm on 150mg a day it seems to be improving again. I'm very careful not to miss a dose though from what I've read about the withdrawal symptoms. This should be a long term medication for me as it works and I've got no long term side effects.,Pelixue

When I finally met the psychiatrist I have today, with his help and his innate understanding of what bipolar is, it only took 3 or 4 different prescriptions to finally arrive at Effexor giving me the best overall help.

50,Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 23, 2012",17,"I am a 17 year old female who has had manic depression for about 6 years. I had it pretty well-managed while I was on a combination of Wellbutrin and Celexa. However, I started hallucinating from the Celexa so my doctor switched me to venlafaxine. The switch of the medications was bad. I would scream and cry and freak out for no reason at all. I also had terrible headaches. I decided to keep on it to see if it got better...and it did. About 2 weeks into it I started noticing that I would hardly ever have anxiety or manic episodes. I'm about 3 months into it now, and I hate it. For some reason the venlafaxine has done the exact opposite of what it is supposed to do. I have hysterical crying and screaming fits at least once a day.",PandaMorningstar

Eventually the withdrawal syndrome went from an onset of about 2 days to half a day - meaning if I forgot to take it in the morning, by mid-afternoon I was experiencing debilitating body aches, nausea, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and general malaise.",Anonymous

No visitors - didn't want any. Since I'm a very social person my friends and family were concerned. My ""up side was better - I wasn't POed all the time and the thought racing slowed way down.

It is the only thing that has worked on my bipolar depression. It has been a miracle medicine for me. Nonetheless, one has to be careful. I was manic on it at 150 mg without a mood stabilizer.

60,Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,,"February 13, 2010",49,Effexor XR (venlafaxine):I love this medication for the positive affects as far as helping my depression and such. I have been on it for over 10 years. I thought about getting off of it a few years ago and had horrible withdrawal symptoms. It is almost like electricity running through your head and face. If I miss two doses I am flat on my back sick. I can't keep my eyes open because of the visual disturbances. Its like all of my senses are heightened and when I move my head it almost feels like everything kind of moves with a short shift. Needless to say. I didn't get off of it. It is really strange. The withdrawal  symptoms lasted more than a week and didn't improve until I started taking it again.,Anonymous

Every attempt in the past to change/stop the medicine has landed me in the hospital.  I am now taking the generic due to the cost, I can't see any difference.  I consider it my happy pill and have to take it every day or I experience uncomfortable side effects.",embrys4ever

I have missed a couple doses and felt like I was relapsing.  The medicine helped me.  But the side effects are affecting me physically and have become more and more of a nuisance for me over the last year.  I experience a tingling in my lips and get a nervous feeling throughout the day now.  Jittery and antsy.  I soon will hopefully start the tapering process.,Anonymous

A word of warning: Do NOT let your prescription run out or take yourself off Effexor abruptly!  I experienced this by accident while waiting for a mail-order prescription to arrive (my doctor was just moving into a new office and didn't have samples available).  Within 2 days, I was a wreck emotionally (depressive, sobbing for no reason), cognitively (all over the place, no concentration), and physically (impaired motor coordination among other things). The ""brain shivers"" a feeling like an electrical current running from the brain down the spine and back again, are very disconcerting!

Doctor put me on Buspar with my Effexor. FANTASTIC. Haven't felt this good in years, but I felt so good I thought I could get off the Effexor. Lesson here, if you feel better, don't stop taking your medicines, it's working. Ask your doctor about taking Buspar with the Effexor. I have never felt better. No more racing thoughts, etc. Now, just waiting for Effexor to work it's way back into my system. As for coupling it with the Buspar - RIGHT ON THE MONEY.",Anonymous
