It went from being a robust organ full of sensation to being numb, unnaturally soft and permanently flaccid. I haven’t had a single normal erection since using it. My orgasms are pitifully weak and sometimes even painful. None of this was ever an issue for me before I touched this vile drug. It also made me gain 14 pounds.Apparently the sexual side effects are known as PSSD (PSSD is known as post SSRI sexual dysfunction but it can also be caused by some non-SSRI drugs including antipsychotics). I still have the side effects despite being off the drug for 6 months.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",NM13

It literally affects maybe 10% of people that take it, but I had such a high metabolism, I thought it wouldn’t affect me… until it did. 60 pounds in three months I gained.

My Bipolar disorder kept me so riddled with anxiety and anger that it started to metastasize to my personality. I was becoming a bad person. Olanzapine took charge: I started sleeping right. I treated myself and others more humanely. I used to take 10 mg but that was too sedating now I take 2.5 mg. It pairs great with Topamax, which evens out the mood and reduces appetite. Beware of Lamictal — it made me aggressive and unkind.",kpeders2

I'm on a relatively low dose and it's only been a few weeks, but I am starting to see benefit from this drug. My only negative comment is the fact that I do have a bit of an appetite increase... haven't gained weight yet though (granted I am already a bit overweight from all the other psych meds I take). I was discharged from the hospital after a manic/mixed episode and suicide attempt, I have to say that I am feeling a lot better on Zyprexa when in combo with my other meds(Note: I take several meds for various psych issues-- Depakote ER [bipolar], Requip [restless legs], Concerta [ADHD], Effexor XR [depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD], Clonidine [Anxiety, ADHD]).

The absolute worst medication and experience I’ve ever had. It completely took away my personality. It took away every joy in my life. I was borderline suicidal. I have never been so depressed in my entire life. I would take a manic episode over the feeling I had taking this medication any day- and I loath and am terrified of being manic.  Thank goodness I finally advocated for myself and got off of it. Run away from this med unless it’s an absolute last resort. Even then I’d choose no meds over this.

This medication has worked WONDERS for me. Seriously! It makes you very very sleepy at night… and it does in fact make you gain weight. I know what you are thinking It’s gonna make me gain weight?! Yes. BUT it will change your life for the better. (My diagnosis: honestly, they don’t know what’s going on with me. I’m adopted so we don’t know my family’s history with mental health— they think I have bipolar. I’ve been on countless antidepressants and they made everything worse and olanzapine was my first antipsychotic and it definitely was a step in the right direction. I’m now hopping on abilify (and I’m honestly terrified) just to see if I get better results… if all fails, I’m jumping back onto olanzapine because woooo weee is that a miracle drug)",Bella
10,Olanzapine,Bipolar Disorder,6.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 10, 2022",0,I took this for about 3 years. I’m bipolar. It was added to my meds without asking the crucial question of does diabetes and/or heart disease run in your family. It helped my brain break a loop. I got a good understanding about the way things really work as opposed to the way I had seen things through my conditioned eyes. Definitely a helpful drug. Though the side effects I now know are bad. Massive weight gain. I ate everything in my sleep. It took away part of my personality. I became pre diabetic. When I found out about the diabetes side effect I was feeling my body getting sick. So I did what they say not to do and stopped taking it abruptly. Going through the detox was strange but manageable . A month after I quit I saw a lawyer commercial for class action lawsuit asking if I or a loved one became diabetic as a result of taking the drug Zyprexa. I’m so glad I was not taking it anymore. I appreciate what it gave me. I don’t appreciate what it almost gave me.,Not your moms

For the three years I took it it was almost pointless but I wasn’t having as many mood swings but I also didn’t even feel like a person with feelings. When I finally decided to stop taking this poison the withdraws are worse than I could ever possibly imagine for about a month. Now I feel like I have about half of my personality left. Complete brain fog, tardive dyskinesia which is the worst one, I have zero libido whatsoever. There are more like my jaw is now completely messed up for good from Tardive dyskinesia. I had to quit my job because all of the side effects literally made it almost impossible to function.

I couldn’t control the impulses that come with bipolar I couldn’t express myself how I wanted to, it was like I was trapped. 20mg Olanzapine has seriously changed my life I can’t sing it’s praises enough!

But I didn't realize it was slowly making me gain weight and in just under 2 years I gained 80 pounds.  I don't even look like the same person and my weight has not budged even since working with a nutritionist for the past 6 months. This medicine is a blessing and a curse. There's also an article out there from 2014 saying that zyprexa can cause weight gain 2 YEARS after it's taken. You read that right. Ugh.

Im now at a point in my life where I want to get myself off them, to try and get my self confidence and motivation back without them, I have tried before a few times but I slip back into highs n lows... My personally opinion of medication for mental health is some will suit you some won't its all down to the individual. I've been on lots of different types for over 15 years and found olanzapine were the best out of the lot for me. But I say after so long its just a mask with side effects, just like alcohol, etc,.. Having said all that use them but come off them when you feel your ready in my opinion. Remember it's just masking your problems. Our Brain is more powerful than we know.

I have bipolar disorder and it has saved my life and prevented hospitalization. Try it with your doctor at a low dose if you are bipolar, or have psychotic features. If you are just depressed or have another issue like OCD, it is likely not the correct medication for you. Work with your doctor to find what works for you.

The withdrawal symptoms I have noticed from getting off Zyprexa are increased anxiety and difficulty sleeping.  The best way to get off of Zyprexa with minimal problems is to taper slowly.  I would rather deal with the withdrawal symptoms than being drugged out to the point I can’t function.  I also take this with another antidepressant and am convinced I had symptoms similar to serotonin syndrome.  Please use caution and only use this drug as a last resort option.

Taking dandelion leaf or hawthorn gets the fluid off so it’s not a big deal. When I do hit depression I think it brings me too low so one reason my doctor said I can use it as needed. I usually take it 3-5 days in a row then I’m good. My dose is super low .675 or 1.25mg the pharmacy had to order because it’s a pretty uncommon dose. I like it overall and think it’s helpful. It also helps the irritation and agitation associated with mania. It also helps anxiety a bit. Oh, another negative is it makes me crave junk food. I can fight it but it’s hard so I gained 10 pounds in a month when I was taking it everyday. Thank goodness it’s as needed now!",Sims

While I did gain 20lbs so far I also feel somehow more positive about myself regardless of weight gain.  The only real problem so far is I feel a bit sedated and tired and it is making it difficult to stay awake and do things all day without going to sleep. For a bit doctor told me to take it at night instead and my body should get used to it after a while anyway and the sedative effect will be less of an issue.

Zyprexa was the first med I tried to get me down from a manic episode which worked but I went off of it because it was way too sedating. I was on 10 mg then 5 mg.  When I went off of it I had a lot of anxiety from withdrawal. I then tried Rexulti which messed up my sleep and gave me anxiety and even when I went off of it I was still waking up everyday at 4 am and had awful anxiety. Then tried seroquel and vraylar (bad restlessness) Finally decided to try zyprexa again but this time at 2.5 mg (subtherepeutic dose) and although I’m groggy in the morning I overall am really happy with my choice. I fall asleep at 12 and sleep like a baby till 9 and don’t have the awful anxiety in my chest anymore. I would say zyprexa can be a great drug at a very low dose.

I also gained 4kg, which is nothing compared to a good part of people here. For a period, I used it with Lexapro, which did nothing for my depression as well.

At first it was like this drug restored me to myself - I was happy, creative, and optimistic for the first time in years, sleeping solidly, and my moods were stabilized. But after the first few weeks I started developing anxiety, restless legs, severe leg tremors. Yet my psychiatrist kept upping my dose. For three months I was in a absolute hole, every minute lasting an hour, out of my mind frantic with anxiety, exercising like crazy, having violent leg tremors every time I sat down. Finally I demanded to get off the medication and we tapered it down over a month. I was able to relax and the tremors and restless legs went away. But then I stopped sleeping - entirely. In desperation I got back on the lowest dose. I started sleeping again for another few months, but the anxiety and restless legs and tremors are coming back.

Prior to using this I had a severe manic episode induced by Zoloft. It worked almost immediately for getting rid of my psychosis and helping me sleep. I was on 20-25mg at the time and all I could think about was food. Gaining weight for me personally was needed since I'm male and 5' 10"" and only weighed 135 pounds at the time. I gained about 25 pounds in a matter of 7 days.  Weight has levelled off and I've been on 2.5mg for most of the time I've taken this. The longer you take it the higher your chances of developing tardive dyskinesia, so keep that in mind. Over the past few months my side effects have worsened tremendously. I have had muscle weakness and shakiness, in addition to muscle twitches. I have to stop taking this med as the side effects have become too severe.

Definitely calmed my nerves and made me feel somewhat human again. I also take Klonopin which also helps, but is not as effective.

As a matter a fact when I came to this country I never heard of bi-polar until about 20-25 year ago. today it seems that everyone you speak to has the disorder. Why is that?  I do think that many people need to be on helpful medicine but not Olanzapine which has plethora of side effect even reported deaths. My theory is this I think many people have been convinced by psychiatrists that they have depression and suffer from bi-polar disorder. In  the late 1980's and early 1990' there were cases in courts for doctors taking kick backs for prescribing this very expensive drug  . Could this still be happening today.,George Ganko

My father is a severe case of bi-polar and is medication resistant to the point where E.C.T doesn't do anything. So my doctors (considering my family history) put me on Zyprexa. I had no benefits, only side effects, the worst being recurring hallucinations. I didn't gain weight (it would be good for me, I weigh about a 100 lbs). It's not the miracle drug for me.",Anonymous

My thoughts are slower and it has gotten rid of any anxiety (this I think is the best side effect). I have not had issues with weight gain. I change between 5 and 10 mg per day and how I feel. Sometimes it can cause me to sleep late and need to take it earlier in the evening to avoid that.  Great medicine to keep me stable and stop intrusive thinking.,Anonymous
