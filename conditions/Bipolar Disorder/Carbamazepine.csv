0,Carbamazepine,Bipolar Disorder,,,"September 21, 2021",0,"This drug is the opposite of peace of mindI used carbamazepine for over 3 years and the effects that i have now are very terrifying. It first started with little eye ache in the right eye, then it extended to the two eyes, till this moment I've been having serious ocular disturbances which seems to be permanent. Plus lack or coordination, weakness and abnormal thinking.  This is what  went through while using that drug",Anonymous

3,Carbamazepine,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,,"January 23, 2021",5,"I have bipolar disorder with psychotic features. About 2 years ago my symptoms became worse. Constantly shifting between mania, depression and psychosis. So I decided to try meds again. I immediately began to feel better. I was experiencing auditory hallucinations and extreme paranoia for months following a psychotic break. This medication made all of that go away. I don’t feel my mind going a million miles a second, I don’t get as overwhelmed, I can handle things more easily at work and home, I’m calmer, more patient, and it also really helps with anxiety and sleep. It kind of just keeps me on keel. I don’t have any side effects from it at all. Overall this medication has saved my life. I don’t want to ever stop taking it! I currently take 200 mg ER in the morning and 400 mg ER at night. I find ER works best for me since the IR version seemed to wear off kinda towards late afternoon. I’m just so thankful for it!

I demanded a medication change and 16 weeks ago I was put on carbamazepine and quetiapine. In terms of treating the manic symptoms it's working really well, but it doesn't seem to work for the depression side of things, so my Dr is going to add a low dose anti-depressant. The big problem I have is migraines. I'm a chronic migraine sufferer anyway and since taking this medication I have had a migraine every day, that doesn't respond to my migraine medication. I'm really hoping that they subside because I'm going to have to come off this medication if they don't.

Taking 600mg dampened feelings such as love which I didn't like. I then stopped it but became prone to being a little too passionate again. So I started a very low dose which doesn't do heaps but I think it helps. I don't think it will change the world but may stop huge manic outbreaks. Not sure about hypomania though.",Ash1050

It is not much help with depression.  I had tried Lithium, Depakote, and a few of the atypical antipsychotics prior to carbamazepine and the thing I loved about this drug is I did not gain weight on it, in fact after coming off Depakote and on to this I lost 40 pounds.  So for me it is weight neutral.  I have heard others say otherwise...some gained, some lost, some stayed the same.  My serum sodium does run slightly low, and I am sometimes tired, but that is the mainstay with psychiatric drugs.

They had such severe side affects that they were cancelling out any good they could of possibly been doing for me.. that is until I found carbemezapeme. It took me about 6mo-1yr to really figure out the correct dose, but with the help of some great Dr's and therapist (and THAT really is the key, it can't just be about meds, good Dr's and the right meds go hand in hand) we figured it out.",Anonymous

The first night I took this I slept for 14 hours, which is actually way more then I usually do. I also didn't really feel like myself taking this medication, it kinda sucks the life right out of you. I would reply slower to things, take longer to think of responses, and all in all lack the normal enthusiasm I usually had.

I was taking anti-depressants and anxiety medication for 3 years. My mood would vary greatly throughout this time period.

I call my therapist he suggested that I go to the emergency room.  I did. I ended up getting admitted for attempted suicide.
