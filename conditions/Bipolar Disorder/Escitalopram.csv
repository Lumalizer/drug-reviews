0,Escitalopram,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 31, 2022",0,"This has been an huge transformation for me and my family. I was always irritated and would lash out at my family, to the point they were sometimes afraid. My wife finally had enough. I made a doctor appointment and he agreed I wasn’t depressed but that he could probably help me with what I’m dealing with. Let me tell you, two weeks on 10mg and it was a whole new world. I was calm and hardly irritated, and 2am insomnia is almost gone.  For twenty years my family had to put up with me and I thought that’s just the way I am! What a waste! Not that I was intolerable but….. As for side effects: more lethargic but not at all crippling; less libido but that ok for now as my wife doesn’t want much to do with me (hopefully that will change). I adjusted when I take the pill so I’m not so tired in the morning and at work.",Tech

I was anxious to take it since I don’t always react well to meds but so far no bad side affects. Helped with hyper sexuality too which is so relieving. I am no longer fighting that. However, I just upped my dose to 15 mg as some anxiety did return after a few weeks.",WildRose

4,Escitalopram,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 27, 2021",3,"Hi, bipolar can be managed 100% to very good level on this so that now it is like I have no bipolar disorder. Everyone needs to find the correct medicine for their bodies. I highly recommend escitalopram 5mg , I took it first and then stopped because of side effects. Then I tried it again and after 2 weeks of taking it all symptoms gone away after 15 days. So escitalopram has been 100% cure for my bipolar at a dose of 5mg. per day. I also have  recommended it to other patient and they got same results and living very healthy life. It is a very strong mood stablizer when taken in 5mg, and if taken at 10mg it will cure depression.  Give it a go your life will be changed.",AliBhaii

9,Escitalopram,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 4, 2020",9,"Hello,I've been long diagnosed bipolar II (since a preteen)I've tried many medications with awful outcomes - escitalopram has been the only thing that has ever helped. I started out on 10 mg which was eventually increased to 20 mg which I continue to take to this day.My disaster plan with my doctor is to start quetiapine once daily along with my escitalopram which has worked great. This plan has kept me out of the hospital and psych ward.My only complaint about escitalopram is the sexual dysfunction side effect. I am lucky that I am still able to achieve orgasm but it takes 4x as long as I do unmedicated. I know this is such an awful side effect but you have to look at the pros and cons... don't give up on your medication for a partner.",potato

I'm bipolar type II and before starting therapy and the meds I used to deeply love or hate myself. I used to think I was amazing, beautiful, great at everything, and then the hypomania would pass, enters the depression and hating myself for being rude to others, arrogant, talking too much, believing that was me. Anyway, the drug made me nauseous and sleepy for the first week, but after that I'm really happy with it. I'm more calm, I'm stable and feel in control of my life and emotions for the first time ever. The only negative point in my experience is that it makes me drunk way faster, but since I only drink occasionally and with friends it isn't a huge problem.",Morticia

I feel like myself. I no longer overthink minor setbacks or inconveniences and have an easier time managing stress. I’ve been taking Lexapro for two years.

13,Escitalopram,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,,"July 27, 2019",21,"After battling anxiety and depression since childhood (recently diagnosed as bipolar ii), and trying COUNTLESS drugs as therapy, lexapro is the first to have such a profound effect on me. I feel like myself, and not just every now and then, but everyday. Things that would have thrown me for a loop of overthinking in the past no longer do, I can rationalize and talk myself out of negative thinking, and I'm not constantly spiraling. I feel like I have my life back thanks to this miracle of a medicine. I recently applied and got accepted for my dream job, am moving to my dream city, and am handling it like I've wanted to but never could. Finding the right medication is a JOURNEY and can be such a frustration, but stick with it because when you do, it helps so much. ALSO, my only downside thus far (have been taking for 3 weeks now) is that I am VERY sleepy.",thankful

I have been on lithium for 7 years and it has done wonders for my mania and insomnia issues.   I do go through short bouts of depression,  but not something I can't power through.   However I was hit with a very long lasting depression that severely hampered my work attendance and aspects of my family life.   My Psychiatrist put me on Lexapro and it did wonders for me.   However,  it really cut into my lithiums ability to control my insomnia and mania.  I was really only getting 1 to 2 hours a day sleep,  if that.   Doc had me halve my dose and it helped a lot.   After a few months I left the lexipro and feel pretty good. I can see that this is not for all.   We all have different needs that is why there are different meds.

After trying to go the natural route which lasted about a year, I found myself spiralling into a hardcore relapse of depression, which is my murky grimy pest. Along with unpleasant ruminations, I just couldn’t stand it anymore. I decided to see my doc and accepted that I need meds. Put me on 10mg. Day one wow! Went into what seems to be a hypermanic episode: increase energy, motivation, sociability, desire to be out there! I really fooled myself into thinking my gosh I was so imbalanced that it’s gonna help from day one. Come day 2&3, horrible anxiety! Insomnia! Melancholic features 10 x worse! I even tried 5mg and no difference, everything sucked! I could not stand being like that for 3-4 weeks no way! I would’ve walk out of my job and lost it. I’m gonna see my psych next week and accept I need some kind of mood stabilizer. SSRIs just won’t work for me :(",Chunky chunk

The beginning symptoms for me were terrible, extreme nausea and vomiting, restless leg syndrome, jaw clenching, and vivid nightmares. After the first day, the nausea and vomiting was gone, and after two weeks my symptoms were manageable. I felt like this medication really helped me with my depression in some ways. I was much more motivated, more sociable, and it helped my anger issues. However, I decided after six months I would like to stop to see if my depression was better. Bad choice. I hurt all over my body so bad, I felt like I was coming down with the flu. I was so dizzy and disoriented I couldn't even function in my daily life. It was a nightmare.",Amby250

Where I used to be extremely reactive and explode in to a rage at any little thing I now feel calm and at peace with the world. I have actually started to feel happy. I always suffered from hypo-sexuality and it was so exhausting to be fighting with sexual thoughts and tension constantly. It's such a relief that since being on escitalopram this too has stopped. I now see everything from a much more rational perspective. I've even begun to really ""feel"" in love with my wife. Sure, it's one big drawback is that it is an orgasm killer, but I'm finding this is a small price to pay compared to all the benefits. It's given me my life back",Mr Bean
