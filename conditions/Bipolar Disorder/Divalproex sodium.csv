The VA does not prescribe ADHD meds so they prescribed Depakote and Ziprasidone.  The first night I took them I woke up during the night and felt so intoxicated I couldn’t make it to the bathroom without assistance. I tried the meds for a few more days, called the VA and told them I was dropping the Ziprasidone because I was completely incapacitated. I continued with the Depakote. I had regular blood tests and each time my dosage was increased in an attempt to get the medication blood level to where it is supposed to be ~100. I went from 125mg up to 2000mg daily.  The side effects became extreme. Hand and face tremors, blurred vision, slurred speech, dizziness, inability to walk straight, hangover, emotionless or weeping, zero libido. The highest my blood maker got was low 60’s. I have since backed off to 1500mg (500mg am, 1000mg pm). Hate it!",Frazzled

Finally, I received a BP2 diagnosis and since then have been on this medication for a little over a year. I've had neither crushing lows nor frenzied highs since starting this medicine. Even old triggers, like poor sleep or the onset of wintertime do not cause me much disturbance anymore. This is the only drug I take for my condition. It has significantly curbed my anger and anxiety as well. The only side effects are nausea and stomach cramps if I take it on an empty stomach. The pills smell like vanilla and have a coating that makes it easy to swallow (doesn't stick to your throat).For the first time in a decade I feel very close to ""normal"". I have hope for my future. For me, this medicine has been a blessing. Bipolar is a serious neurological condition, never be afraid to seek help and advocate for yourself.

But if you have bipolar like I likely do, then this is a medication worth talking to your doctor about.The problem is, this is not a medication to take lightly. It can really damage your liver if you're not careful, and you need to discontinue it carefully instead of one day deciding not to take it. This is not something you order in a fast food drive thru and expect to take without losing part of your old self. I used to be a compulsive artist and maybe it's a good thing I'm not that anymore, but I liked who I was.My experiences so far....(1-2 weeks)....I feel like I can actually relate with people better. I'm not broody or angsty. My migraines have disappeared. I don't think i'll be manic anymore, but I never knew that who I really was == a manic person. So I guess I have bipolar? I never felt that way but that's why I'm not a doctor.",FreudianSlipper

To name a few: zoloft, wellbutrin, deplin, mirtazapine, lithium..... none worked, in fact a couple made me literally freak out and I got baker acted. When I was in the hospital the psych they had me stop taking lithium and start depakote and I thought - here we go again, I'll probably be in jail or dead soon. Within 1 week, I had my emotions back, was actually feeling happy, and could feel that my mood was stabilized. This medication has saved my life.

Although I'm having crying episodes at night and afternoon, it goes away after an hour. I didn't gain weight even though it made me hungry.

16,Divalproex sodium,Bipolar Disorder,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 10, 2021",0,"Depakote (divalproex sodium):My experience with Depakote was terrible.  From severe weight gain to becoming bipolar to eventually being completely subdued and dumbed down.  In three months, while still being sick and hardly eating at all, I had gone from having lost 15 pounds due to my illness to gaining upwards of 50 pounds  in two months on Depakote.  This took me from 222 to over 270 lbs and my body did not level off in weight gain until I hit over 300 pounds. Needless to say, the doctors took me off Depakote and eventually put me back on Dilantin brand.  For me, this drug was a real nightmare and over 10 years later I have still not lost the weight it caused me to gain.  Personally, I would stay away from Depakote but, if you do take it, be careful about the weight gain side effect.  It's brutal.",Troy J.

Definitely gained some weight the first couple of months, but as I was nearly underweight before, the extra weight filled me out nicely so I can't complain :)Currently taking 1500mg at night. Definitely helps me sleep better without making me a zombie when I wake up (Seroquel). The only thing that can be a challenge is the general grogginess I feel on this drug. Definitely not like the fog left by Seroquel, but I do yawn a lot and sometimes I need a dose adjustment. But I believe it's a worthy trade for being comfortable in my own skin for once :)",RedWax

Every review I have read about Depakote it's been mainly 1000mg also 500mg. That just blows my mind! With any medicine you have to be eased into things and adjust from there! I began with 250mg, my Doctor told me that after a few weeks I could adjust it to taking 2 doses (500mg). Just to play around with it to see if I in fact needed to go higher. So I did, when changed to 500mg it made me crazy, nutty, mean and intolerable. I backed off and on 250mg again. I have been normal and perfectly stable ever since. I have yet to read a person taking the lowest dosage as a starting point. Start slow and work your way up (if needed). This medicine has been a lifesaver!",busybee2

When the dose was upped to 1500mg she had daily migraines. We have seen several improvements in her symptoms but not enough to keep her on a medication that makes her gain weight and decreases her self esteem.,moparcrazy

Super, yes, I know but I started at 140 lbs in six months I bottomed out at 206lbs. I slept 12 hours a night, plus a nap of 2 hours in the evening. Someone finally caught the Depakote/Paxil fiasco, and lithium and wellbutrin became my friends...more importantly, I feel like I ""woke up"". I lived the life, but it seemed so surreal looking back on it...IT completely controlled me. It's not the Wellbutrin and the Paxil, it's the lack of Depakote (and for a large part, Paxil) that made me almost another person. I'm sure Depakote works for thousands of people...it just took me out of the equation TOO much.",troyz

242,Divalproex sodium,Bipolar Disorder,7.0,,"December 7, 2009",41,"Depakote (divalproex sodium):I was prescribed this because it is a mood stabilizer.  In other words, I sank down pretty low in mood with long term stressors such as death of family members and a couple of moves, not going to AA and not being in therapy (ugh). I started this recently and at 500 mg seemed to be able to sleep.  At 1000 mg, I was restless.  If I'm feeling low then it's doing what it's supposed to I suppose.  I will cut back to the 500 mg and take it in the morning and see if it makes me sleepy or hyper.  I take 22 mg of Buspar at night because I was also suffering from anxiety that was not letting me sleep.  I liked the fact that Depakote works well almost immediately, and I was assured that after three weeks, I should feel ""normal"" again and can quit.",larubia69

For whatever reason, I did not respond to Depakote as a mood stabilizer.  This is surely not the case for everyone.  The problem is that while taking this medicine, I gained 30 pounds, as I constantly felt hungry.  I was warned ahead of time that this tends to keep the brain from perceiving fullness (or something to that effect).  I noticed this within a few days of starting Depakote but continued taking it because I didn't have many other options at the time.  The weight gain created an entirely new aspect of depression.  Just something to keep in mind if you're just starting it and weight gain is an issue.",Anonymous
