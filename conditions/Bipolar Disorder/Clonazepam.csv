0,Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 17, 2022",0,"Works as designed, everytime. Saved me from a lot of what could be bad days. Only thing is they make me a little sad, but a lot happier when it kicked in and my anxiety faded into the mist as quick as it came. The tiredness and slugishess that you get sucks if you have to get things done. Keep this to yourself and don't tell anyone you take this bc they will judge and call you  something stupid. They don't understand how it is to live with mental illness especially bipolar. Anxiety and panic attacks are a real things we deal with in this specific illness, and can be debilitating to say the least. Klonopin is a good med, a lot better than alprazolam in my opinion. Way better than ssri, or mood stabilizer garbage.",Anonymous
1,Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2022",1,"I live with seasonal Bipolar 2 and my manic phases have been getting progressively worse; when they start in the spring it's like I'm going 800 miles an hour and my movements and gait are all off, I go from being a rather well-coordinated person to crashing into things and practically ripping doors off because I can no longer calibrate my movements, I can no longer figure out how to make coffee or use the TV remote, it's beyond awful and I become completely dysfunctional and have to take 2 weeks off work. Then it starts to slow down and I gradually get to ""normal manic"", where I function better but am still a little speedy and overreact to things and can't sleep more than a couple of hours, which makes me exhausted. It was at this point that a psychiatrist suggested .025 mg clonazepam and it was like a miracle -- I could fall asleep, woke up happy and almost calm, and it has stayed that way. I can work normally. I feel the mania is still there, but under far better control. Life-saver.",Anonymous

3,Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 20, 2021",8,"I am 57 and have been on some dosage level of Clonazepam for about 20 years. I started it, with Prozac, when my first diagnosis was Major Anxiety/Major Depression. As my diagnosis changed to Bi-Polar I and I gradually developed a cocktail of drugs that worked together very well, Clonazepam has remained the one constant. At one point I was up to 4 mgs a day, but I'm now down to .5 mg as needed (usually about every other day). I've never taken more than prescribed and have never had any sleepiness from it. Ativan, by comparison, makes me a zombie. Most anxiety drugs have that effect on me. The thing that has been the best for me is the feeling that I'm not on a drug when I take Clonazepam. Just the feeling of being anxious or overwhelmed becomes a bit more manageable. I understand why this drug isn't the right choice for everyone, but unless there is a definite alternative, I plan to stay with it. If I can be just that much more myself, why shouldn't I?",Melisander
4,Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorder,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 12, 2021",4,"I was prescribed this as part of my Bipolar 2 /PTSD/ADHD treatment regimen over 20 years ago. I took it daily. In the past 5 years I was placed in hospitals twice for depression where the doctors didn’t believe in benzodiazepines. The withdrawal was an absolute nightmare! No sleep for 10 days, extreme paranoia, depersonalization and derealization. I realized I HAD to get off this medication. After a slow taper I was successful. I wish my anxiety was addressed with a therapist and talk therapy instead of blanketing my issues with this medication in the first place. Been off it 286 days and counting.",Clare
5,Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 5, 2021",13,I have used klonopin off and on for over 20 years as a PRN for my bipolar disorder. It works extremely well at managing anxiety and panic attacks. It also helps with sleep. I use CBT with my therapist to help manage my routine. If I get off my routine and stop using klonopin I become manic which is detrimental to my life in many ways. I have tried several different meds but none works as well as klonopin for me.,Dee
6,Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 31, 2020",6,clonazepam really helps with my TMJ since all the other medications tend to work for a short duration.

I have to beg my psych dr to prescribe them to me and he will give me fifteen 5mg tabs for the month. They help but if he would give me 1 mg at night I would be able to function like a regular human being. Sometimes I even have to resort to buy some off a friend. I don’t care! They help get me out if bed and live in the real world. I would never abuse these. They are a life saver for me.,D

13,Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorder,9.0,,"March 13, 2018",29,"Since a teenager I was thought to be just depressed (2 suicide attempts and months in hospitals). I spent my early years on Welbutren(sp?) at 18 after another episode, I was switched to Zoloft.  I stayed on that for almost 2 years, but would go from feeling  nothing at all, to pacing in my room not able to sleep for days.  Scared to death about everything.  After I’d come out of these phases, that some times lasted months, I would sit back and be embarrassed for all my outrageous actions (quitting colleges, acquiring far too many ferrets, because I honestly believed they’d save me, only wearing one outfit but insisting to do my laundry every day etc...)  Finally at the age of 24 I was prescribed Klonopin.  .05 mg up to 3 Times a day.  90 a month.  Suddenly I could sleep again.  I didn’t believe in mysterious rituals, I could actually hold down a job.  I was diagnosed with Bipolar depression and got prescribed Klonopin paired with lexapro.

After taking citalopram for 12 years for what doc thought was regular depression, I went off that and now searching for mood stabilizer for bipolar moods.  Clonazapam 0.5 2x daily helped stabilize my anxiety after all of this and Ativan 0.5 as needed for panic attacks.  Clonazapam is great because it stays in your system much longer than Ativan.

I find the clonazepam works better than tegretol, valproic acid or lithium for me.  Clonazepam has anti-seizure properties as well as anxiolytic properties that work well for me along with with the mood lift Prozac gives.  I recommend it if you have Bipolar Disorder.",Kirk01

With Bipolar Disorder, once you learn how to recognisance when you are feeling a little high this drug is excellent to reset back to normal. For me it's just 0.25mg before bed when needed. I tend to wait for Friday night as will make it harder to work on a workday. That way you can relax in bed on Saturdays due to good half-life of product.

There are so many varieties that I don't know which ones work for me anymore. The doctors all tell you it's the same thing. If that's the case, why have I stopped and started so many times? The most common reason is tolerance, i suspect. However, it has been my observation over the last 10 or so years, that the different colors, sources, and whatever ""fillers"" that are in some of these clonazepam, alter the effects too randomly. As sufferers of the horribly misunderstood disorder, we should have more resources to find out what is in these and  more insight into which ones favor our individual bipolar characteristics.",Randazzle :)

I find it helps more than the short-term benzos like Xanax and Valium.  For one with BPD, Bipolar, and Anxiety Attacks, this pill is a godsend.  I usually do not advocate pharmaceuticals, but I have never had my anxiety quelled like klonopin does.  It is highly effective for any type of anxiety, and stops panic in its tracks after 15-20 mins of administering. This is the only pill that i'm on that I advocate.  The only warning I have is that it has high potential for dependence, and the body gets used to having it constantly.  Sometimes it requires upping the dosage.  PLEASE start on 0.5 mg.  If your dr starts you on 1mg, it will bring on extreme fatigue, and decreased motor function.",Veronica P.

I suffered alot from Anxiety or panic attacks and i must say that Klonopin has been the best drug i have ever had, even better than Xanax.

Also on Adderall twice a day and find the combination helps me concentrate and feel much better about myself. Before this combination I was suicidal. Now, I even look forward to the next day.

66,Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorder,10.0,,"August 2, 2011",37,"Klonopin (clonazepam):Clonazepam is very effective in controlling agitation and providing much needed rest for bipolar disorder. It takes away the racing thoughts and irritability associated with mania. I also suffer from very intense anxiety and 1mg to 2mg/day allow me to be functional without clouding my mind. I prefer Klonopin to Xanax or Ativan because it lasts longer (up to 12 hours) and I don't feel the craving between doses. Withdrawal from clonazepam is not as hard as some people say, it must be gradual. If that doesn't work, ask your physician to switch clonazepam to its equivalent in diazepam.
