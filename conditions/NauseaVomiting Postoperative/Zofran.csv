1,Zofran,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,9,,"November 16, 2020",4,I had a horrible reaction to the anesthesia after surgery and was given Zofran for the nausea. I am now three weeks taking it and it has been a lifesaver for me. It works really fast and the only side effect I have is hard stools.,3beckhams

I also have had this HUGE fear of vomiting, so bad that I’ll work myself up and become so anxious that I feel like I’ll vomit. This little tablet helps a BUNCH!",gwace
3,Zofran,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 14, 2019",5,I had a gastric plication done (like gastric bypass) and woke up after surgery profusely throwing up to the point they had to sedate me again to put the anti nausea stickers behind my ears to keep me from vomiting as soon as I woke up again. Well they gave me the Zofran to take at home so I would take them every 4 hours before the last dose ran out and didn't feel nauseous ever again. Really great stuff.,Mcrasheeda
