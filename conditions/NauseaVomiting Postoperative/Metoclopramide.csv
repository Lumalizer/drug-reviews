0,Metoclopramide,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 11, 2019",4,"Reglan (metoclopramide):Reglan is the only medication that has ever worked for me post-operatively. Phenergan gives me hallucinations, and zomig doesn't work at all. Every other surgery I've ever had I couldn't use the pain pump because I would vomit so severely or become so dizzy from the medication that they would give me for the vomiting that that made me sick. This was a godsend for me.",vonn
1,Metoclopramide,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,10,,"October 26, 2011",23,"Reglan (metoclopramide):Post bariatric surgery, I was in the hospital for almost 2 weeks with horrible nausea and vomiting. They added Reglan to my medicines and after the first dose, I stopped feeling sick and was able to come home. This is the third week post-op and I am taking it about 1 times per day in the syrup form (Tastes awful!). It was my reflux that was causing the problem, and every other reflux medicine did nothing to touch it. I am so thankful to have this medication available.",Anonymous
