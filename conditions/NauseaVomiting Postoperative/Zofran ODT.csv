0,Zofran ODT,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,10,,"November 4, 2009",15,"Best anti-nausea medication available. Very effective for those undergoing chemotherapy. Also good for conditions when you are nauseous and require a narcotic analgesic - nausea will still subside. If you are allergic to other nausea medications such as compazine and/or reglan, like I am (severe panic attacks), zofran is your safest best (only side effect I have occasionally noticed is slight headache). The only real downfall is the price of the orally disintegrating tablet, because there is no generic. The non-ODT tablet does have a generic, and is also very effective, but if you need relief FAST, ODT is the best way to go.",Anonymous
