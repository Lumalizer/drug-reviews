0,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 4, 2021",2,Think some reviews are suspicious since the CDC wanted [ finnergan ]  which was 10 times the medication Zofran is. The headaches are severe and nausea/ vomiting hits without warning. I tried but could not tolerate the pain and misery. 'Phenergan' was by far superior and boosted mood. Because it was such a good medication and better than Zofran or any so-called antidepressant. I can't believe Zofran has replaced other medications in hospice comfort packs.,#Medicationnotdrugs

2,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,9,,"November 16, 2020",4,Zofran (ondansetron):I had a horrible reaction to the anesthesia after surgery and was given Zofran for the nausea. I am now three weeks taking it and it has been a lifesaver for me. It works really fast and the only side effect I have is hard stools.,3beckhams
3,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 6, 2020",16,"Zofran (ondansetron):So I was prescribed Zofran when I got my wisdom teeth out! Worked like a CHARM! I also have had this HUGE fear of vomiting, so bad that I’ll work myself up and become so anxious that I feel like I’ll vomit. This little tablet helps a BUNCH!",gwace
4,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 14, 2019",5,Zofran (ondansetron):I had a gastric plication done (like gastric bypass) and woke up after surgery profusely throwing up to the point they had to sedate me again to put the anti nausea stickers behind my ears to keep me from vomiting as soon as I woke up again. Well they gave me the Zofran to take at home so I would take them every 4 hours before the last dose ran out and didn't feel nauseous ever again. Really great stuff.,Mcrasheeda
5,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 26, 2018",1,"This medicine is a wonder drug. I have Ulcerative Colitis and an ulcer. I recently had a gastric bypass, and that's when all the problems started. I couldn't eat. I'd throw up everything. Even limiting things to one small bite every 5 minutes was too much. The doctor prescribed me Zolfran, and said to take it as soon as I felt the 'pressure' letting me know I was liable to throw up. With this surgery, you have to get your protein and calories in every day, or you will not lose weight. I plateaued for awhile, but after getting on the zolfran and taking it 'as needed', I've lost 78lbs in 6 months, and eating is getting easier. I don't know how I would have survived this without the Zolfran enabling me to keep my protein levels up.",Mandi
6,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 18, 2018",2,"I had dental surgery, was given one dose of Ondansetron. Had extremely bad reaction. Experienced nausea, vomiting, dry heaving, muscle twitches, seizures couldn't open my eyes but could still hear. Three days could not eat and took sips of cola as advised by my local EMT (yes they called 911 on me as I did feel like I was dying ). Had trouble with my eyes adjusting while trying to focus, my vision would snap in and out. Now with all that said, I have taken Ondansetron several times before with no problem . You just never know.",Gma
7,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 30, 2015",10,"Zofran (ondansetron):I've been given Zofran pre op and post op for all ten surgeries, including my hysterectomy since I always have nausea and vomiting before/after surgery. I've even got Zofran during ER visits for migraines, gallstones, and ovarian cyst ruptures. This is my go to antimetic and I even have the ODT   in my nightstand in case I ever get too nauseous. Amazing drug!",OodlesOPoodles
8,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,9,,"June 16, 2014",10,"I began taking this medication after I had a very complicated, invasive surgery due to a ruptured appendix left to leak for three days, peritonitis, etc, for the nausea that accompanied surgery, and condition itself; it worked wonders, kept me from vomiting, and kept the nausea entirely at bay.I recovered well and stopped the medication a week after surgery, however, about 3 weeks post op, I began experiencing constant nausea and pain, without a known cause, which made my life absolutely miserable constantly. I couldn't eat or drink without nausea and feeling like I was about to vomit, couldn't function normally, lost several pounds, and felt like crap constantly. Then, my surgeon prescribed this medicine, and life was okay. :)",Rupturedappy269
9,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 30, 2014",11,"Zofran (ondansetron):Was given Zofran for nausea in Recovery Room before going to same-day surgery unit prior to release.

11,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 20, 2012",2,"Was taking ther pain medicine Tylox after ACL repair and broken femur. Although the Tylox helped tremendously with the pain, I would get the nauseous feeling and vomit even when I ate before taking Tylox. Dr have me a prescription for ondansetron and it worked beautifully. I take it 10-15 mins before I eat and take the Tylox 10-15 mins after I eat...no more nausea! Yay",Coleman wife
12,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,8,,"November 28, 2011",6,"I had surgery and the post operative narcotics made me very nauseous and I had to throw up. A full dose (8 mg) of ondansetron helped but did not fully resolve the problem. Then I got Phenergan and all the nausea was finally gone. I think, for me, Phenergan is a better anti-nausea medication, but while ondansetron (Zofran) barely made me sleepy, Phenergan made me very sleepy. (I actually think, if you are at home or in a hospital, it is much better to take Phenergan as it seems to help more and also gives you a good sleep. If you need to go to work or school, you should take Zofran. ",Szabina
13,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,1,,"November 8, 2009",22,"Zofran (ondansetron):Very bad side effects: increased nausea, and vomiting, trouble breathing, blurred vision, eyes would not focus, excessive dizziness",Anonymous
14,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Postoperative,10,,"November 4, 2009",15,"Zofran ODT (ondansetron):Best anti-nausea medication available. Very effective for those undergoing chemotherapy. Also good for conditions when you are nauseous and require a narcotic analgesic - nausea will still subside. If you are allergic to other nausea medications such as compazine and/or reglan, like I am (severe panic attacks), zofran is your safest best (only side effect I have occasionally noticed is slight headache). The only real downfall is the price of the orally disintegrating tablet, because there is no generic. The non-ODT tablet does have a generic, and is also very effective, but if you need relief FAST, ODT is the best way to go.",Anonymous
