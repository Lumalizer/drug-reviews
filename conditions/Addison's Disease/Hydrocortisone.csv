1,Hydrocortisone,Addison's Disease,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 12, 2019",12,"Cortef (hydrocortisone):Cortef has saved my life Diagnosed with Addison’s 7 years ago after months of declined health (deathly thin, anxious, random cry spells, brain fog, intense nausea, lower back pain) and eventually slipping into a coma. Once the doctors figured out it was Addison they put me on Cortef. It was a bit of a challenge at first, trying to figure out the right amount for my body however after about 2 years of trail and error I found the right dosage and the proper times to take them as I found that was extremely important. I was also put on Cytomel which I would highly suggest for anyone who’s struggling with Addison’s disease. With those combined meds, Addison’s became controllable. Until I started premenopausal symptoms and now it feels like the first year of my addison diagnosis. I’ve been taking a bit more Cortef as of late to help me through the premenopause which can become more of an issue for the body and brain.",EllyBee
