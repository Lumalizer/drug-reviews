0,Dexamethasone,Addison's Disease,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 2, 2021",3,"For ME - a life changer! After years (about 25) of hydrocortisone replacement therapy, I asked (implored) the endocrinologist, who conducted my annual review, if there was anything, anything at all that he could offer me to give me even a marginal 5% improvement on the quality of my life.His response was to suggest that we might try dexamethasone. (10 mg once daily) Almost immediately, I got MY life back and re-discovered the pleasure of waking up in the morning, eyes wide open, Previously I would have had to drag myself under the shower before becoming awake. The horrible fatigue was reduced massively and, since that day (about 8-10 years ago, I have enjoyed good health.I personally cannot identify any negative issues, though medical science may have reservations, which possibly explains why it isn't a predominant form of treatment.",Thos
