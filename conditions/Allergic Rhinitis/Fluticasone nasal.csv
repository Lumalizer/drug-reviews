They kept me on Flonase for 15 yrs.  I was on it constant as well as Allegra.  I can’t count the number of times I asked are you sure a steroid nasal spray is ok to use everyday and won’t have side effects?. Resounding answer was always no, perfectly safe. I kept taking it all those years because I thought rhinitis was the source of my headaches. Flash forward, I got very sudden vision problems . I had always had 20/20. Optometrist said it was age (I don’t think 45 is that old). Then years of increasingly debilitating headaches that no medication (not even narcotics) would touch. I never correlated this to Flonase. 3 weeks ago, 10/10 headache woke me up, vomited, almost went to ER (again), dizziness . Made appointment to get MRI then found this site! FURIOUS.

I had a deep pain in the nasal cavity and a horrible, dry cough.  I don't think the cough is from the allergies, I think it's from the spray. The headaches are definitely from the spray as every time I try to use it, I develop them.  I threw it in the garbage.  My primary care doctor loves to tell me that it ""all stays in the nose"" and doesn't enter the rest of your body systemically which is total bull.

I recently stopped using Flonase and have noticed the following changes : Sleeping much better, feel calmer, skin far less irritated, long term mucous cough improved by 80%, scratches healing quicker.  It's still early days but I have to question the claim that nasal steroid sprays are topical and not absorbed by your system.

I hadn't noticed any issues until here recently. I contracted COVID-19 in January of 2021 and like many people lost most of my sense of taste and smell. After 6 months, it really hadn't returned. After Covid, I started having daily mild nosebleed. A few weeks ago I started getting sinus headaches, specifically after trying a generic flonase and then back with nameNbrand flonase a few days later.  I decided to go off of flonase 3 weeks ago. No more sinus headaches. My nasal bleeding is less. My sense of smell and taste are back full swing but not quite normal after just 3 weeks of being off flonase. I about cried when I could smell a bar of soap or bacon cooking. I thought I was a long hauler with Covid19, but it seems it was flonase. My experience might not be the same for everyone, many who had Covid19 do lose their taste and smell as a result of the virus, that just wasn't the case for me.",Allergy3000

I started using it again after giving it a break due to nose bleeds and burning in my nostrils each time I used it. Plus it just wasn't working, and I was still congested no matter what I did!

Before that all I did was not breathe, sinus headaches, and all over miserable.  My doctor gave me this and I'm amazed by how quickly it works and once the 2 week period wore off, I was able to take it every other day, which I do now.  No side effects at all.  I have bipolar depression anxiety and ptsd.  I'm medicated for these problems so I can't comment on psychiatric side effects.  All in all, this med is a life saver for me.  Make sure you read very carefully the pamphlet that comes in the box to verify that you're using it correctly.  I tilt my head slightly forward, breathe in  and spray twice and breathe slowly outta my mouth.  As far as cost, I was shocked at how much the drugstores charge for this.

The first day or two I noticed immediate relief for my post nasal drip symptoms - but then the following days I began feeling extremely fatigued & anxious.  I've suffered from anxiety & depression in the past and have it under control, so I am always aware when my mental health is feeling off - and the only logical explanation for this change was the introduction of Flonase in my system.  I stopped using it immediately, and feel as though I am experiencing withdrawal symptoms - headache, fatigue, brain fog, anxiety - I would've thought I was going crazy, but was so relieved to see that others had similar experiences with Flonase.  I'm feeling a bit better each day, but from past experiences with anxiety, I know it will take a bit of time to feel back to normal.

I knew the headaches were a side effect but I legit ended up in the emergency room 6 times in 3 weeks. They couldn't find anything on me and I kept telling them the meds I was taking. They told me to take the entire bottle until it was done. I stopped for a few days at first and I began feeling a bit better. Then the a doctor told me to spray it sideways in my nose. 2 days later my symptoms are back and my heart is racing and my head is pounding to the point I went to walk and get some fresh air. This had been setting off my anxiety and panic attacks back to back and I thought I was dying. I will not be taking fluticasone again and the fact the doctors did not mention this to me. I lost so much sleep and couldn't eat. I lost 17 pounds and struggling to eat again. Would not recommend.,Unknown
23,Fluticasone nasal,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 31, 2021",9,"Flonase (fluticasone):This was taken daily caused increased appetite, cravings and rapid weight gain. Gained 70 lbs in 2 years, all can be contributed to months where taking this was a constant daily with Allegra. Once both were discontinued weight gain stopped and was able to lose weight. When both continued (as per Dr.) weight gain began again despite dieting, exercise plus having an active job and am not sedentary. Both cortisteroid nasal sprays and antihistamines have been studied separately and shown to cause weight gain, yet neither drug lists it as a side effect. If obesity runs in your family, STAY AWAY!Additionally, it did NOT help my allergy to mold. I still have chronic post-nasal drip and congestion.

I decided to try an experiment. I went off the Flonase for a week and the pain had subsided.  However; due to having vertigo and very severe allergies, my doctor wanted me on it so I went back on and sure enough the excruciating pain in my back and legs came back.  As of tonight, I am going off of it again to see if the pain stops. If it does, I will be talking to my doctor about doing something else because it can't be a coincidence for me that this is happening.

Other than consistent nasal drip, gums so swollen on my right side of my mouth, top & bottom. Gums aching & pain while chewing on right side. Didn’t realize it was that bad until dentist said gums on right side were inflamed and puffy. The next day I stopped taking it. Took over 14 days to stop the aching mouth. When brushing & using water flosser my gums always started bleeding before going to dentist and after dental cleaning. Finally seeing little to no bleeding gums and minimized swollen gums on day 18.

I used the Flonase exactly as directed and I think this made a difference.  My advice is to give it time!  I used both Afrin and Flonase the first few weeks.  I tried to really cut back on the Afrin and only use it if I had to (still led me to using 4xs per day).  One day I woke up breathing just fine and didn't reach for the Afrin, only used the Flonase.  For the rest of the day,  I didn't use Afrin! It's been 30 full days Afrin free!  I never thought I could kick it.  Be patient,  use it as directed and keep using it!
