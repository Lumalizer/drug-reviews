I do have trouble sleeping, but it’s because I sleep with a toddler in my bed, am a very light sleeper, and my mind is always racing over stupid stuff like my most recent heartbreak, so I would not attribute my sleep issues to Claritin, nor am I more or less thirsty than usual. It does seem to do something subtle and lessen the severity of my allergies, but honestly I don’t notice much difference. What I plan to do is get a Nettie pot, steam inhaler, and air purifier and have them be a part of my daily regimen. I used to surf and be in the saltwater daily and my lifestyle has changed. It is only since I stopped surfing, that I am an allergy sufferer! So I believe salt water is the cure and keeping active and drinking tons of water.",sinusitis247

It say's children's but 2 pills has the same amount of Loratadine as 1 regular claritin. So, I decided ( since I have horrible allergies) I'd try it. It tastes great!  It was also very fast acting. Withing 20 minutes my nose was clear. My throat isn't itchy at all. I know it says it's for kids, but I think I might start taking this. It makes taking a medication I have to take more enjoyable!",MrsGold310

If I stop taking it, symptoms return after 2-3 days.  This is not a short-term fix drug.  Try it at daily for at least 2 weeks before you decide if it works for you.",Anonymous

We use it to treat allergies, both seasonal and year-round.  It is not always one hundred percent effective for the worst attacks, but it is very often successful, and best of all, it does not cause drowsiness. This is very important to us. ",wallywetlake

This is the only relieving medication I've found and is available over the counter. Also if you take other medications this seems to be much better and more compatible without interactions and is non-drowsy. Claritin (Loratadine) wins in my book.,craig764

I dont suggest using more than described on the bottle.",DrHow2
