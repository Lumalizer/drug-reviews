1,Methylprednisolone,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 16, 2021",3,Medrol (methylprednisolone):The use of Prednisone and Medrol together (simultaneously) causes the lungs to dry up and seriously inhibits breathing. It is a dangerous combination of drugs used for rhinitis. The use of Afrin is useless.,Mary Jane

3,Methylprednisolone,Allergic Rhinitis,9.0,,"April 8, 2020",25,"Dr prescribed methylprednisolone for my sinus ear congestion.  Ears in pain,  popping eustachian tube and off and on sudden blocked sinus that seals shut and or reopens instantly.  Clogged = severe ear pressure which creates my anxiety issues to go through the roof with panic.  1st day of prednisone I was expecting a nightmare after reading all the bad reviews.  By my 4the pill on the first day I began feeling ear relief. By day 2 midday I had ZERO pain or pressure in my ear.  I'm also type 2 diabetic.  It did raise my sugars pretty significant so I got around that by eating absolutely zero carbs. No carbs whatsoever and it'll help keep the sugar spiking at bay for the most part.  Day 3 felt great.  No major anxiety issues except for some mild anxiety.  No sleep issues.  Doing great.  Day 4 still okay.  Day 5 I feel ear pressure returning.  Sinus swelling beginning again.  Day 6 last pill and by end of the day my ear pressure was back.  Calling doctor tomorrow to see wtf I can do.  I had no major issues.",Nate

I still have headaches,  can't hear, zoned out, always hot (and I'm always cold) nose gunk is now thick and yellow. Why is it not working?",Not working!
5,Methylprednisolone,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 14, 2019",13,Prescribed methylprednisolone  for allergies and I feel horrible. I feel like it is the end of my life I have been unable to sleep for two nights and my condition still the same.  I can’t believe anyone can make a medication like this one with horrible side effects.,Truth
6,Methylprednisolone,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,,"October 25, 2019",80,"Medrol Dosepak (methylprednisolone):I was diagnosed with extreme allergies. I had thick mucus stuck in my throat for days and now water build up in my ears  causing vertigo issues, and three various medications (Benadryl, Flonase, Zyrtec) weren't helping me.I was prescribed Medrol Dosepak so my body would stop overreacting to itself and get under control. After the first dose -- I was feeling great.I also have extreme anxiety but had ABSOLUTELY no issues on this medication. I think either it just didn't affect me like others.  So if you also have anxiety disorder, STILL try it. Don't let yourself get worked up over a ""what if"".I had no sleeping issues at all. No stomach upsets. No headaches. Nothing-- just felt relief.  I will use it again in a heartbeat, should my allergies ever struggle again to be in control.",Allison

Began coughing up a small amount of phlegm from chest cough and doc says medrol pack - 21 tabs.After 3 days, no phlegm, still coughing at night or when laughing but have not slept for 3 days. That hurts. Symptoms are disappearing as I type. On 2nd and 3rd day, I was short of breath and dizzy playing golf. In 2.5 more days I hope it's done, cough gone and I can sleep again, PS take in the morning is suppose to stop the insomnia.",Michael
8,Methylprednisolone,Allergic Rhinitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 13, 2019",25,"I am on the methylprednisolone 21 pill dose pack and on day 1 it cured my sinus infection that would not go away after 2 long weeks. The side effects will hit you. I have experienced sleepless nights, racing heartbeat, and nausea, but tbh I’ll take that over the unrelenting sinus pressure and headaches I was experiencing. The after taste  is not fun either but again I can function now so I’ll take it.",Bree
9,Methylprednisolone,Allergic Rhinitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 26, 2019",23,"I have had problems with my sinuses for years! At least 2x a year my sinuses get all backed up. My face hurts, my ears hurt and it eventually runs down my throat causing a hell of a cough. The only thing that works is a steroid pack!!  Within 2 days I can always feel it working!!!  Its my miracle go to!!",Stuffy72
10,Methylprednisolone,Allergic Rhinitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 28, 2019",6,"MethylPREDNISolone Dose Pack (methylprednisolone):TBH I don’t really know why my ENT prescribed me this stuff, he just said I think I know what your problem is and this should help. Guess I should’ve probed him for some more information. Side affects have been nuts though. I can actually breathe, but I worked out by going to cycling which I usually do weekly... half way through the workout I wanted to DIE. I was sore as hell, and when I got home to try and sleep I couldn’t because I was in so much pain, I do think it has added to my, already there insomnia, too. It does make me a bit irritable, but the crazier side affect has been my mega increased libido.Craziness.",Wowza

Wake up with eyes matted shut, plugged nose with chronic cough.  This medicine is the greatest for me with no known side effects.

13,Methylprednisolone,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 24, 2019",9,"This is some grim stuff. I was prescribed the 16mg tablets for allergic rhinitis, which comes and goes every now and then. First day I took it.. very hefty headache and some trouble sleeping that night. I thought 'Was that the medicine I took, or did I just lack fluids today?'. I left it for a few days, took 1 again today. Nope. Not good at all. I feel like I've been beaten up. Head ache, lower back aches, legs ache, got no mental clarity. If anyone suffers from allergic rhinitis like myself, consider the fluticasone fuorate nasal spray. That's been excellent for me.",mercer18
14,Methylprednisolone,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 23, 2018",37,"Medrol Dosepak (methylprednisolone):I took this for one day only and experienced far worse symptoms. My heart was racing the entire night; I felt like I was having a heart attack. I had severe anxiety, I was sweaty, yet had the chills. I slept maybe 1 hour the entire night and tossed and turned hundreds of times. I felt sick to my stomach with overbearing nausea. I experienced abdominal pain the next day. I am discontinuing taking this. I would not recommend it to anyone.",YoungGal
15,Methylprednisolone,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,,"February 25, 2018",22,"Developed a bad cold and went urgent care. The Urgent Care NP prescribed Amoxicillin & teslon perles for me. Teslon perles worked great to quiet my cough at night, but 7 days after going to Urgent Care, I had to go back because I felt worse: horrible sinus headache, sinus/cheek pain, nasal passages horribly swollen, and blowing my nose constantly. Went back to Urgent Care and the NP RXd a stronger antibiotic & a Medrol dose pak for me. I took all 6 pills of day one of the  pak, and after a 5 hr nap, my sinus headache was gone & the pressure in my cheeks was greatly reduced--all by the end of day one on the pak. By the end of my second day on the pak, I felt better & my sinus symptoms were greatly reduced. Medrol dose pak has always worked very well for me. (Plus, it always makes my arthritis feel better!) Con of Med dose pak? As I am weaning off of it, my torso will feel sun burned, sore, & sensitive to touch ...but I am willing to go through this side effect to get rid of a painful sinus infection.",Rachelle
16,Methylprednisolone,Allergic Rhinitis,2.0,,"September 8, 2017",9,"I am 29 years old. Went to the doc for an ear infection and sinus pressure that I think turned into a bad sinus infection. Was given the 21 pill PAC 4 mg. Felt fine day 1, day 2 woke up feeling great but slowly felt numbness in my fingers, nose and cheeks throughout the morning. By lunch time I thought I was having a panic attack from the constant heart racing and shortness of breathe. At one point there was a stream of heat shooting down the back of my neck. Thought I was having an allergic reaction, but after reading other reviews (because it was a Friday after 5 and couldn't reach my doc) it appears these are side affects. I will be going back to the doc Monday, this is why I hate taking meds. Feel like this drug is doing more harm than good.",Kelsey_12

My doctor then prescribed this medication to me to help with the itching, rash, & my swollen glands. The first day of taking it I felt off. Earlier in the day I felt hot like I was experiencing a possible hot flash (I'm only 29) my face then became hot & red as though I had been out in the sun for too long. I felt light headed, dizzy, unbalanced. I just didn't feel like me. The next day, I didn't feel hot though I felt tired very very tired. I also felt hungry. I was on edge, I felt so anxious & irritable. I stopped taking it. I will be calling my doctors office tomorrow. I would rather have swollen glands & itchy skin.",Wendy.

I had seen this Dr. Before when I had a bad case of sinus problem which he gave antibiotics. It cleared me up for 3 weeks and then I had a bad relapse.

23,Methylprednisolone,Allergic Rhinitis,3.0,,"October 29, 2016",8,"I was given this medicine in the 6 Day Pack for an allergic reaction. Since I started taking this medication I can't sleep, I maybe doze off for 20 minutes if I'm lucky. I feel very hostile and confused, like I can't progress my thoughts at all and I keep forgetting what I'm doing. On top of that I'm experiencing a lot of shortness of breath and every time I stand up I get dizzy. I'm incredibly thirsty and have to use the bathroom more often now since starting to take this medication. I can't wait to be finished with it seeing it's 50/50 helped with my symptoms.. The taste is horrible, like acid in my mouth and I have to take it with milk to make sure it doesn't burn. Since yesterday morning I've developed a short throat and bloating. :/",ICANTSLEEPNOW

After my first sinus rinse while taking methylprednisolone, I couldn't believe my eyes - no thick, yellow mucous on the tissue! I can breathe!The sleeplessness is there. It's almost more annoying than drowsiness, because you'll want to sleep -- but can't. But the relief is worth a few sleepless moments.",ArIck
