0,Promethazine,Allergic Rhinitis,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 17, 2021",0,"Phenergan (promethazine):I take this when my hay fever is really bad. Works amazingly well for relieving hay fever symptoms and also as a mild sleep aid. I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks and unfortunately this drug makes my anxiety 100% worse the next day, like I'm going to have a psychotic break or something. Disappointing as it works so well for sleep and hay fever.",Celia
