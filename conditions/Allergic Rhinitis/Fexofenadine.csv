0,Fexofenadine,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 12, 2022",0,Allegra (fexofenadine):Took for about a year for Allergic asthma allergies before I realized when I ran out and started something else that I no longer need a walker to walk and I regained all the strength in my legs!!!

1,Fexofenadine,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 29, 2021",0,Allegra (fexofenadine):I started taking it in May 2021 and sometimes with montelukast for sinusitis but it did not work. Whenever I tried stopping it since last 3/4 months I have serious broncho spasms and breathing difficulty. I don't know what to do so I break down 180mg pill into 3 pieces and take two with 6 hour difference. Before spasms started at 4 pm but now it is all times. I am stuck and don't know what to do to taper it off. Is there any help anywhere on how to stop its withdrawal symptoms. I stopped montelukast and it didn't cause any issue. I had gastritis or swelling in stomach after I took a short period of low dose prednisone and in April a common antibiotic and 2 weeks aspirin. I started fexofenadine/allegra but it dint help me much. I have been only taking to not have withdrawal syndromes. I wish someone can share their experience on how to stop it. Thanks for reading.,JTW

3,Fexofenadine,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 27, 2021",0,ENT prescribed generic for symptoms of unknown allergy causing dizziness and stuffy nose.The dizziness disappeared after 1 year of daily treatment. I used to use a cortisone nasal spray as well but now only use saline nose spray for my nose stuffiness. It's so much better now so I only take 1 in the am and 1 in the PM. It's also helped my major allergy to mosquito bites.I recently got a bee (not wasp or yellow jacket) sting and upped it back to 4 a day and it did help me tolerate the itching and swelling. After 9 days I developed cellulitis because of the sting and the medication does nothing for that terrible itching.  Only constant ice packs and major antibiotics are curing that.,Edk

I drank some tea, hoping the caffeine would help. For the next few hours I struggled hard. I was completely drained of energy and my head felt foggy. It was horrible.
