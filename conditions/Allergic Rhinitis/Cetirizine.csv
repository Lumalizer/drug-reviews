3,Cetirizine,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 2, 2021",0,I started using cetirizine about one year ago. I tried to come off this drug but like others my skin became so itchy that I had to use it again. It was like I was addicted to it. I even used corticosteroids and they didn't help at all. But finally I found a way to discontinue it and I want to share it with others that have the same problem. First you have to cut the pills in half (which will cut the 10 mg dose into 5 mg) and use it for one month. Then cut the half pill again into half (which the quarter of the pill will contain 2.5 mg) and take it for another month. Now you are able to discontinue the drug without any itch. It's important that every time you cut the dose in half you have to take it for a whole month before moving to the next level so your body can adjust to the new dose.,Mhdmpr
4,Cetirizine,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 17, 2021",3,"I tried ceterizine for possible dust mite allergies as I have a few friends who use it daily for environmental allergies and swear by it. Unfortunately, the side effects were intolerable for me. I had a CRAZY amount of anxiety and really dark thoughts while I was on it. I was super irrationally angry as well. I do have GAD but this made it about 100x worse within a couple hours of taking it. I don’t think it helped the allergies much either. I was worried it would make me drowsy, but weirdly I slept maybe 1-2 hours a night for the few days I was on it! It was a pretty intense experience, would not do it again.",Rose Girl

I’ve been off of it for 9 days now and I’m still experiencing severe itching all over my body!! Other symptoms included moodiness, weight gain, brain fog, dizziness, and overall dependence on the drug. Zyrtec causes crazy withdrawals!

I stood still and breathed calmly, drank some water, it got better but I’d just taken the Zyrtec an hour before so I was still at full dose for 24hrs after that. Zyrtec is the only drug I’m taking, and it was sudden and odd, so I checked. Tachycardia and cardiac arrest are indeed among the listed side effects for this drug. It’s now a few hours past when I should’ve taken my next dose and I still feel a little jittery today. In retrospect I’d been feeling jittery, impatient, and cloudy for hours before it happened, and I’d not been sleeping well for 2 nights. So I think if you’re feeling uncharacteristically jittery it may be a warning sign. I was also having headaches 2 days before it happened. ",Irene
