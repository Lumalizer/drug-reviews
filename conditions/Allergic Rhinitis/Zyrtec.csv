This is how I did it...I went from taking the 10mg pill to 1/2 pill for 3 weeks.  The 4th week, I took 1/2 pill of claritin.   I then went to 1/4 pill of claritin  for two weeks.  I am now free of zyrtec and all antihistamines with very minute itching.  Consult your doctor, but this truly worked for me.",Goldie

4,Zyrtec,Allergic Rhinitis,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 9, 2021",1,This stuff worked great in the beginning for my allergies and overall health. I had terrible itchy skin and post nasal drip that this medication helped with. It also gave me a healthy appetite. As I used to be underweight at 140 lbs most of my life. Now I’m now a tall 217 lbs dude and I feel healthy! The only negative side effect is this medication gave me terrible muscle pain and joint pain. I no longer take it but it did help me for quite a while. I still have a healthy appetite and maintaining the weight after being off of it for so long now.,Unknown

9,Zyrtec,Allergic Rhinitis,3.0,,"July 8, 2021",25,"This drug is horrific. I’ve been taking Zyrtec daily for about 3 years. It got the the point where my allergies were still so bad that the medication wasn’t even lasting me 24 hours. I did not want to begin taking injections, so I started skipping 2-3 days to see if that would help build my tolerance back up. I’ve been googling itchy palms and soles for months, years, trying to figure out where this was coming from!!!! I finally found the answer it is Zyrtec withdrawal! I’ve been off of it for 9 days now and I’m still experiencing severe itching all over my body!! Other symptoms included moodiness, weight gain, brain fog, dizziness, and overall dependence on the drug. Zyrtec causes crazy withdrawals! I also feel like my allergies were worse taking this medication, I would get extreme congestion and itchy eyes. Both of those two symptoms have gone away since getting off this medication and removing dairy from my diet. I would rather heal from a low histamine diet than ever take this drug again!!",Mir

When I told my doctor about the uncontrollable itch, they never mentioned this being a withdrawal symptom from the Zyrtec; how is it possible they wouldn't be aware of this. I feel like I'm going crazy, the doctor prescribed prednisone to help but it's not, scalp, soles, palms, entire body is irritated and itching. I've cried.

Doctor is impressed with how health my lab work is! (Since my RBC, WBC and platelet court was low from lack of nutrition.) All of those things are great for me!

One day off Zyrtec, I was dealing with intensely itchy hands and fingers, and some dizziness. After 2 days, I was miserable with the itchiness on my arms, neck, chest, stomach and hands. I have never felt anything like it before. Even the intensity of mosquito and ant-bites pale in comparison. Three days off, I was in bed for 5 hours because I was so dizzy I couldn't stand up, and my whole torsoe was on fire with itch. I called my allergist, who told me to take Benadryl. Thirty minutes after taking the Benadryl, the itchiness and dizziness was completely gone. The next day, I started taking Zyrtec again. I thought that it was all because I was allergic to something in my environment, but I have never had those symptoms occur like that due to seasonal allergies before stopping the Zyrtec.",Ray

I got a new bottle and started right back up the next day, no more itching. I was sure I was allergic to the cats! Then fast forward a few months and I’m consistently feeling very tired, irritable, have horrible head aches, jittery plus other symptoms so I look up side effects of the medication and sure enough they are all listed. I then stumbled upon people talking about the severe itching when stopping taking Zyrtec and I realized I’m not allergic to my cats, it’s a VERY common thing when you stop taking the drug. I was shocked. I quit cold turkey and am on day 10 without it and am still itchy. It’s been awful especially on my hands, chest and scalp. My body feels like it’s burning all over at times.",A

I wish there would have been a warning on their medication because I would not have ever started it. This is horrible. Completely miserable and all I want to do is take a pill to stop this itching.

I recently read that long term use of antihistamines can affect brain health so I decided to quit to see if I notice any changes. Something different happened. I am day 6 without Zyrtec and it has been miserable. I had no idea what was going on given the pandemic. I’m nauseous, foggy, tattoos are raised, upper arms and shoulders are swollen, scalp is itching and extremely sensitive, palms and fingers itching and bruising on my arms. I finally googled Zyrtec withdrawal and there it is, exact symptoms. The bruises are from scratching. Today I discovered tiny bumps in the places that have been itchy. I’m wondering how long this will last. Advice: don’t take Zyrtec long term.If you have been, lower your dosage slowly. Don’t be a hero and go cold turkey.

A nurse recommended I start taking Zyrtec daily so I did.  It has been over 3 years now and I have not had so much as a cold in that time.

31,Zyrtec,Allergic Rhinitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 28, 2020",21,"Allergy triggers have been ruthless this year so I had to bring the ol' Zyrtec out of the cabinet. Everything was great at first but then I started experiencing nausea that grew worse as the weeks went on. In between weeks three and four, I decided that it was becoming unbearable and also remembered this as being why I stopped taking Zyrtec when I got this bottle last year. My last dose was three days ago.I, like most here, developed the burning/itching withdrawal symptom about 48 hours after my last dose but has not been as severe as some describe nor was it the last time I stopped. My guess is that most reporting intense experiences have taken Zyrtec long term while I was only a month in this time and roughly two months the last time I took it. I can imagine how bad it could get if it's as noticeable as it is for me after only a month though.My advice would be to not use this stuff regularly if possible or at all if you can avoid it altogether.",DArm

I will not deny the fact that Zyrtec is the most effective allergy pill I have EVER taken, and that even though it doesn’t completely relieve me from ALL my allergy symptoms it is fast and effective. However, nothing is perfect. I decided to stop it because I’ve become too dependent on it. I’m sure it’s going to be a tough journey but I’m willing to do this for the sake of my body. It makes you drowsy, affects your sleep (I have always been a light sleeper, but Zyrtec made it impossible for me to feel like I slept well), causes depression and worsens my anxiety. I also read that it causes weight gain. I was 60 KG before and was noticeably slimmer. I gained 10 KG’s in the span of 4 years.

The only way to stop it is to take another Zyrtec....... it’s exactly like being addicted to pills!   It’s all over the Internet, and the FDA has buried some of the information on their website.

When getting off Zyrtec you may experience uncontrollable itching that you didn't have before taking the med, I'll tell you how to get off it without the itch. Start taking 10mg Claritin each night for two nights, then cut Claritin in half to 5mg and take for three more nights then stop taking Claritin, that takes the itch away and Claritin doesn't have the withdrawal itch. Once you stop Claritin and Zyrtec you will quickly lose any weight you gained and mood should improve. Hope that helps.",Earthgrow

Now I have no pain but have started itching all over my body. I prefer the itching than the pain.  ",Yube29

115,Zyrtec,Allergic Rhinitis,8.0,,"June 30, 2008",16,"I've suffered from allergies for 10-15 years. I was prescribed Claritin; all it did was make me tired. I was then prescribed Clarinex, which worked wonders, but after I lost my health insurance, I couldn't afford the prescription anymore. Once I learned Zyrtec had gone OTC, I decided to try it. I've been taking it for about three weeks, and, for the most part, it's working great. To combat the drowsiness, I take it before bed. Still have flares that require other medication, but happy overall.",Ashley1982Indiana

120,Zyrtec,Allergic Rhinitis,9.0,,"April 16, 2008",32,"I have used Zyrtec for a couple years to reduce my allergy symptoms and avoid asthma flares. I have a dog that causes symptoms if I play too much, or if I touch my eyes. We got a cat about 1 year ago! Zyrtec met the challenge, the cat sometimes sleeps on my pillow. I am still careful about touching my eyes, but Zyrtec has done a great job.
