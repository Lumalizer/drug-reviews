0,Levocetirizine,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,,"December 18, 2021",1,Xyzal (levocetirizine):I was a happy go lucky person and nothing in the world had bothered me whatsoever. I was on Certizine and it made me tired so I started to take Xyzal. It worked well at first then I noticed a change. I couldn’t sleep until about 2-3 in the morning. I was always irritated and paranoid about every little thing. One day I had a complete anxiety and panic breakdown. I thought that it was something different but after the reviews I realized it was the allergy medication. It made me believe it that it was something else and it wasn’t. I don’t recommend this medication at all.,Anonymous
1,Levocetirizine,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 17, 2021",1,"Xyzal (levocetirizine):Did the research. Xyzal appeared to be recommended for a runny nose due to cold and/or allergies. Supposed to give 24 hour relief. This I assume means a taper into relief and a taper off toward the end of 24 hours. Both my partner and myself took a pill. About an hour later felt some relief, which lasted for 3 hours. At that point it simply quit working....for both of us!",Shawn

3,Levocetirizine,Allergic Rhinitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 7, 2021",0,Xyzal (levocetirizine):So it seems like a lot of people have had bad experiences with this medication and have taken it over the counter.  I got a prescription and spoke with a doctor before taking it so I was aware of some side effects.  The first few days were bad.  I did experience the additional sleepiness and some bouts of rage and depression.  I spoke with the doctor again and they mentioned to try and stay on it for a week and see if the symptoms subside and they did.  I am 3 weeks in now and it has helped my allergies a ton and the side effects are gone. I am feeling great.,John

I have had a constant post nasal drip since I quit smoking about 6 months ago. Tried EVERYTHING from humidifiers to nasal rinses, mucinex and sudafed, steroid nose sprays and elevating my head. I've been to the doctor multiple times with no answers and this is the only thing that makes it not feel like a lump of gunk isn't stuck in the back of my throat. I have been so miserable coughing up nasties every night. The downsides: gives me heartburn (a lot of things do so it's not a surprise) so I have to take tums with it. It also makes me VERY drowsy, so I take it an hour before bed and then go to sleep.",B
7,Levocetirizine,Allergic Rhinitis,2.0,,"June 14, 2021",0,"So usually I take fexofenadine but its on the more expensive side for me so I wanted to try Xyzal. I usually take my meds at night, about 2 hours after taking this medicine I got super dizzy, enough to not want to drive. (Now this is on me, should have read the packet ingredients and instructions) I can't take Cetirizine because I get ungodly drowsy, but after taking the medicine I realized its part of that family. It made me dizzy, dry mouth and really tired. Should have read one here first, this was my first time ever trying it. I know you're supposed to take allergy medicine for 2 weeks to get used to it but these side effects are a little too much for me.",MeganLJ

During the day, the effects didn't wear off until late in the day, so it compromised my ability to focus at work.  I know that it doesn't affect everyone that way, but for me, I cannot use this product.  It did reduce my allergies, but the sleepiness and brain fog it caused are intolerable unless you plan on staying in bed all day.",Nate

Then the chest pain, heart burn, and edema in my lower extremities started. I quit taking Xyzal and went back to Zyrtec. I should have known taking something in the same family would still cause problems. I took Zyrtec for four days. The palpitations and chest pain started up again and I had a bronchospasm.

Thought oh I'll try Xyzal - it would be so nice to not suffer in the day too - whoa... me, too- among those suffering heart palpitations on it! Not good! wow... I will NOT be using it.

When my allergies are not bad.... I cut back to a half pill and it keeps my sinuses clear and if I come across a friend’s dog or cat, the small dose in my system keeps me in good shape in those situations too.

27,Levocetirizine,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,,"February 22, 2018",7,"Xyzal (levocetirizine):I was hopeful that Xyzal would be the life changing allergy medicine I’ve been searching for. The first dose I took at bedtime, woke up to less allergy symptoms but as the day went on my mood went downhill... easily irritated, grumpy, depressed and crying. This is so opposite of my typical mood. Took second dose thinking it was just PMS or something, woke up dreading my day and more congested. The gloomy feeling is still there and after reading side affects I’m certain it’s the Xyzal. I don’t tolerate Zyrtec or Allegra either, but when you’re recovering from your 3rd sinus infection in 2 months you search for the best remedy. My daughter who has year round allergies took a dose at bedtime too, by morning it was as if she hadn’t taken anything. Gave her another dose (5ml) and the poor thing was exhausted at school, could barely keep her eyes open. Back to Claritin for me and Zyrtec for her.
