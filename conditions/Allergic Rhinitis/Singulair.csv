0,Singulair,Allergic Rhinitis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 25, 2021",0,I started using Singular about 11 days ago and I have noticed a big difference with my severe allergies.  Unfortunately I have also developed constipation which is not listed as a side effect and irritability.  Both have gotten so bad I discontinued use last night and after 12 hours I am 75% better with both constipation and irritability but oh my allergies are back. Sigh.,Jenny
1,Singulair,Allergic Rhinitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 6, 2021",1,"I was prescribed 10 mgs of Singulair daily 3 weeks ago for allergic rhinitis & breathing issues I experience when I run. While the Singulair helped dry up the constant post nasal drip, I have experienced a heavy chest & feel I have to exert more effort to take a deep breath. Also, when I ran it did not seem to help. In fact, it seemed like it was harder to get a deep breath while running and taking Singulair. Unfortunately, within one day of stopping this medication, I am back to dealing with the post-nasal drip, but I did not like the feeling that I was on the verge of an asthma attack, so I stopped taking it. I will talk to my doctor to see if there is something else I can take.",Tchr0116

It caused me to have suicidal thoughts and I put a fork to my throat this morning over something stupid and my mom talked me out of it. I’m not the suicidal type and Singulair made me want to take my life. I also have had aggression, worse depression, rage, and not giving a rats booty on what I say to anyone. I talked to my mom like she was a nobody and I’m not that kinda person. I even cussed my own husband out a couple times. I would NEVER talk to anyone like that! I was literally scared of myself. I even broke something of my great great grandmothers and it was one of the last objects my mom had of hers. I’m not the violent type at all.

8,Singulair,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 14, 2021",13,"I was diagnosed with sinusitis in 2014 at age 31. Cause never determined. Ruled out allergies with allergy testing. Had a CT scan which showed excess mucus in my sinus cavities but no structural issues or polyps. I had a balloon sinuplasty which did not improve my symptoms. OTC meds and sprays never helped. My ENT decided to prescribe me Singulair as well as Azelastine spray. I started taking both at bedtime in October 2019. It's been over a year now and I haven't had any adverse reactions. I still have some mild sinus symptoms all year long but have only had a few flareups/infections. I used to have them constantly. I know a lot of people are scared of Singulair side effects and the black box warning, and it's good to be aware of potential side effects. For me, the risk was worth the reward. It's not a cure but it's definitely improved my quality of life.",Merth

12,Singulair,Allergic Rhinitis,8.0,,"November 9, 2020",216,"I felt the need to write this review for anyone who is scared due to possible side effects. I was in here about a week ago reading through all the reviews just absolutely terrified. I told my husband I wasn't going to take it. I suffer from horrible sinusitis, and I've tried everything. My husband talked my down, and he said we would monitor my behavior closely. First night I took it before bed. I had every expectation to wake up in some kind of horrible headspace. I woke up after a good night's sleep and didn't feel any different. My symptoms we're about the same as well. I have consistently taken it for 7 days now and my sense of smell is coming back a little. I don't notice ANY side effects. I feel myself. If anything I feel happier because I can kind of smell again! It has only been a week, but it has given me hope. So if you are here trying to read reviews to make yourself feel better. Listen.

If I do not have tissues, my mucus would just drip on the floor. My allergies always go away around lunch time. I took generic singulair (montelukast sodium) everyday in the morning. Then I switched to the evening. I may have only missed one or two tablets throughout the 3 months that I took it, but my drip is the same as before. This medication does not work for me. I have tried the generics for Claritin, Allegra, and Zyrtec. Now I have tried the generic form of Singulair. All of these medications do not work for me.

Each time I stopped a medication that gave me a rash, it took approximately 8-9 weeks for the rash to go away.
