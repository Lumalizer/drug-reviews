0,Diphenhydramine,Allergic Rhinitis,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 24, 2021",0,"I started taking these for my allergies.   It does help me sleep, but like somebody said beware of  vivid dreams.   I've also experienced dry throat where I have trouble swallowing.   It's a weird sensation.   Not sure if I'm going to keep taking them.",Bsm91662
1,Diphenhydramine,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,,"July 26, 2020",3,"Benadryl Allergy (diphenhydramine):My wife has anxiety disorder and found out that by taking Benadryl that it stopped her racing thoughts. Problem is, it made her mentally confused and babbling about random topics for a few hours. Best case scenario, it will make you pass out, not enter healthy sleep. Other times, depending on dosage as it is very addictive, she would hallucinate and not remember the incident at all! It can also put you in a coma or worse  if combined with the wrong drugs. VERY DANGEROUS DRUG! STAY AWAY.",Mark
2,Diphenhydramine,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 11, 2018",26,Benadryl (diphenhydramine):Benadryl really helps take the sinus pressure away and I found out recently it even worked best for my migraine. Out of Tylenol and Motrin Benadryl was the only one to knock it out.  It does cause me dry mouth and drowsiness. It also helps to calm me when I feel a panic attack or anxiety coming on.  I rather take benadryl then psych meds or all kinds of prescription meds anyday . I hope it stays working wonders for me because claratin and flonase did nothing for me and I don't want to have to try anything else.,Anonymous

Recommended by several urologists.  It also works for other allergies like rhinitis or seasonal allergies.  My current primary doctor does not like it for seniors but it is the only thing that works for me.  I do not take it longterm because the effectiveness wears off but when I need it, and use it intermittently, it works!",Damita

Was prescribed Zyrtec, Allegra and Flonase and I couldn't get relief. A pharmacist suggested Benadryl and its the only med that works. Took a generic brand and all hell broke loose.

6,Diphenhydramine,Allergic Rhinitis,,,"July 21, 2017",10,"Benadryl (diphenhydramine):I have a lot of allergies. About a year ago I began taking benadryl at night to help me sleep. It also helped a lot with the allergies. I only take it at night because of the drowsiness. Recently my stomach was upset for a month and I noticed they've begun putting calcium in it!This is so upsetting! Calcium stimulates stomach acid and people with allergies are sensitive to acid. This has been documented in the allergy journal.I would have thought a pharma company would know better than this!I wish the two corp. drugstores in my area had a better selection of drowsy antihistamines. They mostly have only benadryl. CVS has chlorphen, but it has lactose in it. :( For now I'm making do with a Walgreens combo that includes chlorphen.",Julia372

Can cause drowsiness, but it works quickly and shrinks nasal swelling better than some of the other choices. I take a newer antihistamine during the day, but this helps a ton at night when the other wears off and the pollen is still bad.",NCResident
9,Diphenhydramine,Allergic Rhinitis,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 8, 2016",10,"Benadryl (diphenhydramine):Works better then most prescription drugs for allergies and chronic sinusitis ( I've had sinus surgery 4 times due to this), whose side effect are health threatening. I will only take at night due to the drowsiness, this drowsiness can turn into nervousness if I don't fall asleep and keeps me up all night. I do have drowsy days often with naps from sitting and just passing out.I find that if continue taking every night about the fourth I begin to have vivid and horrible nightmares.

14,Diphenhydramine,Allergic Rhinitis,9.0,,"October 20, 2011",15,"Benadryl Allergy (diphenhydramine):I have severe seasonal allergies as well as severe allergies to dust and mold. I had gone through the gamut of second generation antihistamines (Claritin, Zyrtec and Allegra) with minimal success in treating my extreme symptoms. I decided to try the first generation antihistamine: Benadryl. Of course, it's been around for a long time, but it's definitely the most effective. The drawback to this older antihistamine is that it causes sleepiness, and it's not slight. Also, the newer antihistamines can be taken once a day, while Benadryl doses last only 4-6 hours. But to this extreme allergy sufferer, it's a small tradeoff, because it certainly treats the symptoms far better. ",RipTheSystem
