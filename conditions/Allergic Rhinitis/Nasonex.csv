1,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,,"January 16, 2022",0,It is a nightmare!!! Our pedia prescribed nasonex for my 1 yr 10 mos baby because he is having a difficulty of breathing at night. When  he start using nasonex everything went wrong my baby nose has a very loud sound when he is inhaling and difficulty of breathing which is getting much worst. I am worried it could be life threatening because he cannot breath.  We don't have normal sleep anymore.  When I stopped giving nasonex the bad side effect is lessen although he still have trouble of breathing. I pray to God that everything will get normal soon.,Assy
2,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,6.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 31, 2021",4,I've been using nasonex off and on for quite a few years especially in the winter time as I have a constant runny nose and frequent sinus infections. I recently realized that I have frequent headaches and migraines mostly in the winter time also. This medication was a godsend for me in the beginning but it's not anymore. After long-term use it seems like my sinuses are burning all the time and my nose is still running whether I use it or not. I often have heart palpitations and have even had heart tests for that. I have decided to go off this medication for a long period of time to see if any of the symptoms I've described are caused by the nasonex.,Sam

5,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 21, 2020",4,"Absolutely a wonder drug. For me, this changed my life after years of miserable, miserable allergy seasons. I have almost ZERO allergy symptoms in the spring while taking this the last 3 years. Unclear if there are side effects, will pay more attention when I stop this year. Anyway, they are minor enough to justify this drug that totally changed my spring from hell to something quite better.",Anonymous
6,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 20, 2020",5,I've been using it for a while and it didn't work well for me. I changed to another spray and it got much better. Also had the problem where the mist did not actually reach where it was supposed to go but rather just drooled out.,Jungy
7,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 15, 2020",61,"Absolutely a nightmare! I was on this nasal spray Nasonex for about six months. During that time I developed excruciating leg aches, and flu like aches throughout my body that were never ending. I also had insomnia.  It got to the point where I was so exhausted, depressed and at times couldn’t even see straight. I went to the doctor several times, they took my blood, ran different tests and nobody could tell me what was wrong with me so chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and restless leg syndrome were suggested. I was just about to start more medication for these conditions when it dawned on me that it could be the nasal spray after reading reviews. Hard to believe one puff in each nostril daily can make you feel like you are dying.",jajsip

My doctor prescribed it because I have really bad allergies and from the third day after using it, my throat got tight and dry making me feel as if I couldn't breathe, one week later I'm still having nose bleed from it, my head is spinning, eyes are very heavy, I think I've got every single bad side effect from it. Terrible, terrible, terrible!!! I stopped using right away! How does the FDA approved something like that it's beyond me!!!",Susy

14,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 12, 2019",29,"I have been using Nasonex for over a year, but not consistently. I finally became so miserable with a horrible migraine that I couldn't connect to anything else that I checked side effects. Sure enough, Nasonex is what triggers my migraines. Not only that, I now realize it's what has been making me so mysteriously ill with horrible aches and joint pain, nausea and extreme exhaustion that hits me about 3-4 days a week, which is how often I use Nasonex. I would much rather have a runny nose than feel this sick.",Always Iris
15,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 22, 2018",32,"Horrible drug. Started using it and within 24 hours, I'd started getting severe anxiety, and severe depression . Came off of it, tried again at a lower dose, same thing to a slightly lesser degree. Also gave me headaches and a tight feeling in my throat. Can't take any lower a dose really or it won't be effective. Never using this stuff again.",NJ
16,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 24, 2018",46,"I suffer year round severe allergies with runny sneezy nose, blocked sinuses and itchy red watery eyes.  This product works... BUT for me it isn't worth the side effects - chronic diarrhea, blurred vision, total loss of taste and smell, lethargy, anxiety, headaches and abdominal cramps.  I was taking it last year and had these symptoms, then stopped and they went away but I didn't connect the two until THIS time when I went on it again, been on about 3 months and back came the symptoms. So I did an online search and found so many others with the same experience using Nasonex.  So this week I stopped again and will never use it again. This product can also cause Glaucoma and cataracts - how can people be ready to risk the serious side effects of this just for hayfever?  I'd rather sneeze my way through life then be blind... and now I know why my vision has been blurry :(",DFE
17,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 20, 2018",11,Nasonex changed my life!!

18,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,,,"October 3, 2017",35,"For almost two years I have taken nasonex to control allergies, however, the side effects of it, mostly occurring upon waking, and lasting about 5-6 hours, are unbearable: chronic, tension headaches, extreme fatigue, and some dizziness. I never could relate the side effects to the nasal spray until I had exhausted every other possibility including diet, hydration, other medications, vitamins and herb supplements. Through a long process of elimination, and reading other posts online, I finally determined it was the Nasonex of Mometasone Fuorate spray. You are not alone! Horrible headaches and lasting fatigue are not worth it!!",Hunter7766677

20,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 11, 2016",26,"It worked very instantly, it was a great product. Then I stopped after 2 weeks and it came back straight away. So I had to take it until the entire season finished to prevent the allergic reaction coming again. The product is good except for the horrible leak that drips down your nasal path into the back of your throat.",Lisaaaa
21,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 6, 2016",46,"Negligible improvement of Chronic Rhinitis. Multiple nasty side effects including, headaches, sore throat, muscular aches in throat, neck and back as far down as the kidneys, occasional dizziness. These symptoms started after about a week of one puff per nostril per day. And they are persisting six weeks after stopping use of this product. It is like having a mild dose of influenza without any fever or elevated body temperature. It might work for some people, but for me it is very bad news.",Slipstreamer
22,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 18, 2016",15,"I have been taking Nasonex for 8 years for seasonal allergies to various tree pollens. I get the horribly itchy eyes/nose/palate and runny nose. If I start taking Nasonex a few weeks prior to spring pollen season, it really helps and reduces about 90% of my symptoms. This way, I can still function for the month or two of pollen season. I would recommend this to people with Birch tree allergies.",Koney
23,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,,"February 24, 2016",10,I had a cold with a stuffy nose so I don't know why my Doctor prescribed this for me.  I wish I could give this product a zero. It did absolutely nothing for me except give me severe nosebleeds. I would love to contact the company to complain but I can't find their contact information anywhere. Worst 50 bucks I ever spent.,ilydietcoke
24,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 24, 2016",21,Nasonex worked grateful for my sinuses. It help with preventing headaches. The bad thing is I LOST MY SENSE OF SMELL. I used it for a very short time and stopped when I realized I couldn't smell. It has been over 3  months since I used it. The sense hasn't returned. I also lost my sense for taste. The taste came back after  2 or 3 weeks of not using the product.,Honesty 7
25,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,,"February 10, 2016",24,I have Allergic Rhinitis since I was a kid unfortunately I was told that there is no cure for this allergy it will be with me for the rest of my life - doctors have always treated my so called sinus issue with Flu medication and sinus medication to be honest it worked for a hour max and I am back where I started. A doctor prescribed Kestine and Nasonex almost 15 years ago I used it for the first two days and every time when we the seasons change. To-date I still use the same products and I don't regret using it since - honestly the best medication available for people who have Allergic Rhinitis. ,Oskido

28,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,2.0,,"December 15, 2015",41,"I began using Nasonex to help with nasal congestion and snoring. Worked really well. I was also on Cymbalta and Lamictal for depression. About the same time I started the Nasonex, I began to suffer from acute, chronic migraines, as many as 20 per month. I went through 5 different neurologists/specialists during a SIX year period in which I was more or less bedridden. When the drug company stopped supplying it in September, I had to stop taking it, and haven't had a migraine since. Doctors need to be made more aware of the link between Nasonex and migraines. This condition is incredibly hard to diagnose and treat, as everyone has different triggers. Doctors don't know- for six years they got nowhere-- I was the one who figured it out.",CateN12

30,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 27, 2015",18,"Nasonex worked great for what it was intended. My nasal passages opened up during the worst allergy season on record, and I didn't want to scratch my face off. I had to stop using it though because it was causing tension headaches and eye weirdness. I even stopped and started again to make sure it was the Nasonex, and it was. Oh well. It's worth trying if your insurance covers it, otherwise it's $200+...",nckhella
31,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 21, 2015",18,"I went to the doctor because of a serious flu that affected my breathing because of post nasal drips, extreme coughing and fearsome blockage of my throat while coughing. Among two other medicines including general cough medicine, he prescribed Nasonex. This has helped tremendously. It has cleared my nasal passages and it has allowed me to breath properly. It has stopped my heavy snoring which was caused by having to breath through my mouth.I do not know whether I am imagining it, but for years I have had erectile disfunction, so much so that I have given up trying anything to cure it and just accept my condition. However, lately I am getting reasonable erections at night and I wounder if it is some beneficial side effect of Nasonex.",Lenny Boy
32,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,,"April 2, 2015",14,"This is the best product I've ever used for allergies.  For a long time, I've suffered terribly with hay fever, which antihistimines controlled but it was the constant itchy face, nose and neck that made life miserable for me and I couldn't find anything to control it.  I had tried other nasal sprays but to no avail.  A friend recommended Nasonex and I tried it reluctantly.  After 1 week of taking it (one spray in each nostril every morning) I am delighted.  No more itchiness, sneezing, water eyes and no more misery!!  I'm very happy and grateful and I've suffered no side effects so far.",Summertime1777777
33,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 13, 2015",7,"Nasonex was prescribed because I can't breathe easily through my nose. It is hard to sleep at night and breathing through my mouth is very troublesome.  I would wake several times at night with dry mouth, throat and in the morning, have a raspy voice. Dr thought I might have allergies and thought the Nasonex might open up nasal passages.",Tall Sal
34,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 6, 2015",21,"I've had an annoying and embarrassing hay fever related symptom for about 10 years. First red eyes and  itchy tear ducts which progressed to eyelid twitching. At first my eyelids twitched whenever I sneezed, but then it would happen randomly and increased in frequency. It became so bad I would avoid meetings at the office. I tried the common hayfever medication and some helped off and on but I could never get the darn twitching to stop. A few months ago I saw my doctor for an unrelated issue and he prescribed Nasonex. My hay fever, itchy eyes and eyelid twitching DISAPPEARED within a few days. I feel like a new person now!!!",Rodr
35,Nasonex,Allergic Rhinitis,9.0,,"August 25, 2014",24,"It worked like a magic for my allergy symptoms. I think it took about 24~48 hours to kick in. Now I only use 1 spray per nostril everyday. If I skip for more than 2 days, I start sneezing again, and that's how I know this medication works. Now I am interested in looking into long-term use.",jingleelle

This year I have been miserable, always either sneezing  continually or not able to breathe, or a continuous runny nose, bleeding nose...tired and just not able to function!!  None of this fun or attractive.  I remember my doctor prescribing Nasonex a few years back and I went back and asked for it again.

Although my symptoms are probably slight compared to most others, this product was easy to use and effective without the harsh chemical feel or taste associated with other nasal medications. Instead of two sprays per nostril, I have elected to use just one spray in each nostril and found my symptoms relieved.If your opinion of nasal sprays are anything like mine used to be, give Nasonex a try for your seasonal allergies.",SoiCowboy

Nasonex has made my quality of life much more comfortable and kept my symptoms more controllable, which in turn keeps other related expenses down.  Because of my financial limitations it is my one necessity, although I wish the cost was lower. Makes my over the counter remedies more effective.
