0,Benadryl,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 11, 2018",26,Benadryl really helps take the sinus pressure away and I found out recently it even worked best for my migraine. Out of Tylenol and Motrin Benadryl was the only one to knock it out.  It does cause me dry mouth and drowsiness. It also helps to calm me when I feel a panic attack or anxiety coming on.  I rather take benadryl then psych meds or all kinds of prescription meds anyday . I hope it stays working wonders for me because claratin and flonase did nothing for me and I don't want to have to try anything else.,Anonymous
1,Benadryl,Allergic Rhinitis,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 31, 2017",13,"I have allergic rhinitis. Was prescribed Zyrtec, Allegra and Flonase and I couldn't get relief. A pharmacist suggested Benadryl and its the only med that works. Took a generic brand and all hell broke loose. Went back to the original and I'm feeling much better.",Big bishop
2,Benadryl,Allergic Rhinitis,,,"July 21, 2017",10,"I have a lot of allergies. About a year ago I began taking benadryl at night to help me sleep. It also helped a lot with the allergies. I only take it at night because of the drowsiness. Recently my stomach was upset for a month and I noticed they've begun putting calcium in it!This is so upsetting! Calcium stimulates stomach acid and people with allergies are sensitive to acid. This has been documented in the allergy journal.I would have thought a pharma company would know better than this!I wish the two corp. drugstores in my area had a better selection of drowsy antihistamines. They mostly have only benadryl. CVS has chlorphen, but it has lactose in it. :( For now I'm making do with a Walgreens combo that includes chlorphen.",Julia372

4,Benadryl,Allergic Rhinitis,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 23, 2016",7,"Good antihistamine. Can cause drowsiness, but it works quickly and shrinks nasal swelling better than some of the other choices. I take a newer antihistamine during the day, but this helps a ton at night when the other wears off and the pollen is still bad.",NCResident
5,Benadryl,Allergic Rhinitis,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 8, 2016",10,"Works better then most prescription drugs for allergies and chronic sinusitis ( I've had sinus surgery 4 times due to this), whose side effect are health threatening. I will only take at night due to the drowsiness, this drowsiness can turn into nervousness if I don't fall asleep and keeps me up all night. I do have drowsy days often with naps from sitting and just passing out.I find that if continue taking every night about the fourth I begin to have vivid and horrible nightmares. I also get drenching night sweats - the two are not always together one night I may have one or the other.I take one (1) tablet.",707 NC
