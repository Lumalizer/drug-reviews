0,Dexamethasone,Allergic Rhinitis,1,,"January 10, 2019",24,Decadron (dexamethasone):This drug was given to me for an  anaphylaxis reaction I had from an antibiotic. I was admitted so It was given IV then by mouth to wean. I am a nurse and was blown away! I was put in drug induced psychosis on this med. I was on it about 3 weeks from 6mg down to 1mg. I was 302 initiated at the nearest ER.  I passed out from sleep deprivation and thus drug changed my life for good. It's not worth It! It mimicked bipolar symptoms.  I NEVER had this before! BEWARE!,Heidi RN
1,Dexamethasone,Allergic Rhinitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 31, 2018",26,"Decadron (dexamethasone):This drug is terrible, I am an athlete/coach and have always been a very upbeat/motivated person. I got into a hornets nest and they gave me a shot of this instead of benadryl, I experienced weeks of the worst mood swings of my life, my heart stayed racing so hard I thought I was having a heart attack at times, and I dropped from 160lbs to 145lbs and couldn't stop eating anything in sight. Afterwards I experienced depression/fatigue beyond what I ever thought I could go through that took about 3 months to fully recover from. The migraines were terrible as well. I'm writing this because a friend just stopped by to ask about my experience, he had an allergic reaction and they gave him the same decadron shot. He went through almost identical symptoms. Try your best to avoid this stuff, the side effects aren't worth the benefits.",Ryan
2,Dexamethasone,Allergic Rhinitis,10,,"February 9, 2010",19,"Decadron (dexamethasone):Although I have to go to the doctor and get an injection for this medication to work optimally it does work wonderful when I am having an acute allergy attack.  I end up getting the shot about once a year in the early spring. This medication should be a last resort after other things have been exhausted and is only safe as an injection about every six months.  When my eyes, ears, nose, and throat all become involved and inflamed I know it is time to get a Decadron shot.",Allergic
