0,Claritin,Allergic Rhinitis,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 27, 2022",0,"I was expecting this to have some sort of side effect, but it’s just given me more of a placebo effect. I do have trouble sleeping, but it’s because I sleep with a toddler in my bed, am a very light sleeper, and my mind is always racing over stupid stuff like my most recent heartbreak, so I would not attribute my sleep issues to Claritin, nor am I more or less thirsty than usual. It does seem to do something subtle and lessen the severity of my allergies, but honestly I don’t notice much difference. What I plan to do is get a Nettie pot, steam inhaler, and air purifier and have them be a part of my daily regimen. I used to surf and be in the saltwater daily and my lifestyle has changed. It is only since I stopped surfing, that I am an allergy sufferer! So I believe salt water is the cure and keeping active and drinking tons of water.",sinusitis247
1,Claritin,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 14, 2022",1,"I was experiencing night sweats and racing heart.   I figured the only thing I had done differently was take Claritin.   I went off and the night episodes disappeared.   I tried it again.  Wow. Night sweats  pounding heart, muscle pain.   I will never be taking this again.   Strange as I took this often when younger with no problems.  This is the Walmart generic version.",Horrible drug
2,Claritin,Allergic Rhinitis,2.0,,"February 11, 2022",1,"I took Claritin for congestion due to allergies. Day 1 I felt a bit tired after taking it, but the congestion began to clear. Day 2 I felt fine for a  few hours with the exception of dry mouth, all of a sudden I became severely dizzy and felt like I was going to fall out of my chair. Checked all my vitals, BP, oxygen, sugar, etc and they are perfect. The only new medicine I took was Claritin. I am lying on my back right now writing this review while I am recovering from the effects.",compmend
3,Claritin,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 27, 2022",0,"24 hour pill and I still have 14 hours to go. Fluttering of the heart has made this drug very uninviting.

4,Claritin,Allergic Rhinitis,2.0,,"September 24, 2021",1,"Honestly I am very sensitive to medications so I should have felt some sort of relief and I felt nothing but side effects.

7,Claritin,Allergic Rhinitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 14, 2020",11,"Took one 24-hour Claritin on Sunday. Within hours, my itchy eyes and runny/stuffy nose had cleared. Took a second Claritin on Monday. Poor sleep that night. Tuesday morning, getting out of bed, I experienced a terrible backache and the beginnings of a headache that Tylenol didn't touch. Backache lasted all day. Stopped Claritin before my third dose. Today is Wednesday and I'm feeling zombie-like, fatigued, with lingering back pain. Much as I had hoped this might be my miracle pill, it's not. I'm a 70+ year-old lady in good health who will not be taking this again.",witzend
8,Claritin,Allergic Rhinitis,3.0,,"June 15, 2020",11,"I started using Claritin (loratadine) per my ENT's instructions to address a runny nose/PND.  After one week I noticed facial redness on my cheeks and nose, the only thing different that I'd been using was the Claritin.  I stopped taking it today and sure hoping the redness disappears.  It did work as far as clearing up my nose and PND.",jenn54

11,Claritin,Allergic Rhinitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 6, 2020",25,"Claritin is very effective on my allergy symptoms but it also makes me drowsy. However I've had problems getting a good night's sleep in the past, and the usual OTC sleep aids like melatonin and Advil PM don't always work for me. With ""non-drowsy"" Claritin I haven't slept this well in ages! Need to ask my MD or a specialist if Claritin induces good quality, healthy sleep and whether I can keep taking it as a sleep aid.",Waxtadpole

15,Claritin,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 14, 2019",38,"I was prescribed Claritin by my ENT. I was told to take it every morning, which I did, but after a few hours of taking it, I would get the worst neck pain/head aches. I also got joint pain in my knees. I looked up these two side effects and sure enough a good percent of female patients age 49+ reported these side effects. Seems more common in females.It did nothing whatsoever for my severe allergies and my Otis externa. I couldn't take the pain from this drug and stopped. Within 24 hours the painful aches went away.",Mandy

I took it for 2 days. 1st day I didn’t feel anything except my ears started ringing really bad. 2nd day I took it, it caused the worst confusion of my life.

21,Claritin,Allergic Rhinitis,8.0,,"July 27, 2017",33,"I have chronic allergies (undiagnosed). I suffer from dry , red, stinging eyes and a nose that gets stuffy even with turbinate reduction surgery as well as general fatigue and low energy. Claritin helped me feel functional again and I can look people in the eye when I talk to them. Nose it a lot more clear. It is VERY important to take it for a week before it provides full relief. This did not start working for me till day 4 and now I feel great , perhaps the best ever. I am giving it an 8 because it causes me dry mouth and my sleep is not the greatest.The point of this review is not to fully trust all the negative reviews. Try it for yourself every day for one , maybe even 2 weeks and see how it affects you. Best of luck.",Dinodagino

Depression, anxiety, confusion and sleepiness that was so pronounced I had to pull over while driving. This was the Nondrowsy formula. There are 11 other people who had similar reactions in the support in drugs.com group, under the drug name. I'll deal with my allergies rather than end up in the psych ward.",Sunnyismyangel
