0,Montelukast,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,,"March 20, 2022",0,Taking montelukast has caused irritating side effects unlike the named brand Singular that work wonders for me the generic montelukast has one big irritating side effect is that is causes sleepiness since I started taking this medication I cannot at all sleep at night!! I need to take every night Benadryl to help me to sleep but taking Benadryl on a daily basis is not safe either and since taking this medication montelukast I have plowed on about 20 extra pounds. Look up Singular and wait gain also this medication has distorted my vision with dry eyes and blurred vision.The pharmaceutical company needs to make much needed adjustments!!,Anonymous
1,Montelukast,Allergic Rhinitis,4.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 15, 2022",0,"I went on this medication (10mg) after a massive immune system meltdown that saw my allergies flare with severe fatigue and anaphylaxis-like reactions to perfume. I think it helped as a mast cell stabilser but I'm not sure I would recommend it. If you had asked me while I was on it if I had any side effects I would have said no (especially because of how comparatively sick I was when I went on it). However I have recently weaned myself off this after five years and I am much better off it and I definitely did have side effects. I'm less anxious, agitated and impulsive. I have less brain fog (although this was worse in withdrawal). I had no interest in intimacy, but I no longer feel so dead from the waist down. My digestion has improved, I have less gut pain and diarrhea. I had weight loss resistance, even when on intake below 800cal. But now I'm dropping weight without doing anything different. It will be interesting to see if my 5 years of high iron storage drops now too.",FullySickAussie

It's early days, and happy to write a positive review on the proviso I will revisit and update in a couple of months. I have endured chronic sinusitis for many years. The condition that I have means that I suffer for an average of 2 weeks and then go into a kind of ""remission"" for the following two weeks ad infinitum. My GP suggested this drug: 'Take a tab daily from the day you can recognise the symptoms associated with an onset, and run the course through until you and clear.' I can attest to its effectiveness in preventing the symptoms from manifestation. It is only the second course taken, and to date it's being highly effective. My sleep has improved, and I feel a better me. Overall, very positive.",Ant
3,Montelukast,Allergic Rhinitis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 25, 2021",0,I was on Montelukast 12 weeks and gained 12 lbs. I have always had a stable weight &  maintain a moderate level of physical activity. I couldn’t figure out why I was suddenly gaining so much weight with no changes in diet or activity. Then I came on this website and saw that others were reporting significant weight gain while on this drug. I stopped taking it immediately. It took me a year to get back to my original weight.  I decided that I would rather take antihistamines to help with my condition then deal with heart issues and diabetes due to obesity because of so much weight gain.,Pbandj

I started having vivid dreams which was fine but then I became extremely paranoid and things went back to normal for a while. I cannot sleep properly anymore and I constantly feel like a part of me is missing, my life improved and nothing else but my use of this drug changed so some part of me feels it’s connected. I also experienced a much faster heart rate which was really scary, idk maybe I just had a bad experience but I will certainly not be taking them again and will just live with my severe allergy’s and asthma",Fig

While the Singulair helped dry up the constant post nasal drip, I have experienced a heavy chest & feel I have to exert more effort to take a deep breath. Also, when I ran it did not seem to help. In fact, it seemed like it was harder to get a deep breath while running and taking Singulair. Unfortunately, within one day of stopping this medication, I am back to dealing with the post-nasal drip, but I did not like the feeling that I was on the verge of an asthma attack, so I stopped taking it.

Only took this med for a couple days because of the side effects. It gave me sinus pains and cold-like symptoms, essentially worsening my existing issues. It made me scared that I had caught COVID (despite no one around me being sick) but subsided a day after stopping the drug, so these were side effects, not symptoms of a virus. While I didn't take it long enough to get depressed, the first night I took it I did feel really restless and almost paranoid, like it had heightened my anxiety. I'm not sure if this was a legitimate side-effect or just my knowledge of this drug's reputation but I am HEAVILY leaning towards the former.",Kris

I talked to my mom like she was a nobody and I’m not that kinda person. I even cussed my own husband out a couple times. I would NEVER talk to anyone like that! I was literally scared of myself.

After 2 rounds of antibiotics to clear an infection and a round of steroids, my doctor felt I needed something to keep me feeling ok.  I took this medication for a few months and slowly lost my ability to smell and taste.  I stopped taking the medication after 4 months or so because of it.    When discussed with my doctor, she acted like I was crazy and had never heard of these side effects.  She told me to give it some time and hopefully I'd return back to normal.  It has been 3 months since then and NOTHING.  Smell and taste are still wonky. I am terrified I won't smell something like heaven forbid there was ever a fire at home or work.  I wonder if will ever smell or taste things normally again.",BlueOz

In many of these cases, researchers now believe that the slow removal of steroid treatment revealed existing, but undiagnosed, cases of Churg-Strauss syndrome and that the disorder did not develop because of the drugs. However, the exact relationship, if any, between Churg-Strauss syndrome and leukotriene antagonists is unknown.""",Lilly
18,Montelukast,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,,"July 6, 2021",7,"Every time I visit south Florida, allergies are guaranteed. I have a family history of Asthma but have never had an asthma attack myself. I first tried montelukast as a last resort for my allergies. Benadryl, loratadine, and any other antihistamines did nothing. I don't know if this drug is good for asthma attacks or any other weird lung disease, but it's a miracle for allergies. I take 10 mg daily before going to sleep. I get no side effects (maybe some weight gain?) and my allergies go away after 2 days of taking them. Antihistamines don't work, because histamines are not causing the problem, leukotrienes are, and they're evil. Montelukast blocks these diabolical chemicals and lets you live your life without your immune system thinking you're gonna die just by breathing in through your nose. If you've tried every ""non-drowsy"" antihistamine out there without improving, try montelukast for at least 2 days.",Ander

I can't imagine how much I must have irritated my family constantly blowing my nose! I tried nasal sprays from the pharmacy and doctor, as well as natural home remedies, but none of them worked. The doctor didn't seem to think I had polyps, so I think it was some sort of allergic reaction (to what I'm still not sure). I was then prescribed Montelukast tablets and honestly it improved things within a week. I could have cried being able to taste my meals again!

25,Montelukast,Allergic Rhinitis,3.0,,"February 12, 2021",1,"Montelukast ruined my mental health. On days I was actively on it, I was incredibly depressed, had intrusive and suicidal thoughts throughout the day. Mentally, I was in the darkest place possible. I could never concentrate beyond 7 minutes while studying. I also had panic attacks for absolutely no reason. It would randomly come and go with no rational explanation. I felt suicidal  every time I was on it. Unfortunately, I was made aware of neuropsychiatric side effects only after the FDA started to include a boxed warning in March of 2020. After I stopped the medication, my mental health significantly improved within a week. I am so glad the damage wasn't permanent. I am perfectly fine now mentally. Montelukast did remove my allergic rhinitis symptoms but gave me depression that lasted for 15 months.

I still have some mild sinus symptoms all year long but have only had a few flareups/infections. I used to have them constantly.

I talked to my pharmacist before starting this med and found out that the actual incidence of these types of side effects is extremely low. I read the reviews on here and was scared until I read one that assured me they were scared too and for no reason. I decided to try this med for severe allergies leading to frequent infections and it works so well. Zero side effects and I’ve been on it for at least a month now. My dr said there are few side effects and interactions and it’s a safe, effective drug. I believe he was right.

The did an EKG and it was fine sent me home. After 4 visits to the Urgent Care and two ER visits, a cardiologist,  a HIDA scan and 8 blood draws, someone finally listened to me and did a blood allergy test. I was having an allergy attack due to a dust mite allergy that came back through testing as extremely high as well as other allergens. I was given Fexofenadine (allegra) and montelukast. I will admit I was scared to take anything because the antibiotics made everything worse. After three days of thinking about it I took them both.
