1,Allegra,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 29, 2021",0,I started taking it in May 2021 and sometimes with montelukast for sinusitis but it did not work. Whenever I tried stopping it since last 3/4 months I have serious broncho spasms and breathing difficulty. I don't know what to do so I break down 180mg pill into 3 pieces and take two with 6 hour difference. Before spasms started at 4 pm but now it is all times. I am stuck and don't know what to do to taper it off. Is there any help anywhere on how to stop its withdrawal symptoms. I stopped montelukast and it didn't cause any issue. I had gastritis or swelling in stomach after I took a short period of low dose prednisone and in April a common antibiotic and 2 weeks aspirin. I started fexofenadine/allegra but it dint help me much. I have been only taking to not have withdrawal syndromes. I wish someone can share their experience on how to stop it. Thanks for reading.,JTW

I’ve been on Claritin for a couple months now and it works okay. 3 days ago I broke out with hives and went to the hospital and got prescribed Allegra. The first day I took it it worked great! Now I’m on the second day of it and I’m having panic attacks, anxiety, diarrhea and dehydration. It is a shame because it does so well in treating my allergies but I don’t think these side effects are worth it.",Skull Kid
5,Allegra,Allergic Rhinitis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2021",9,"I have bad allergies to a lot of things. Food, dust, animals, pollen. The list goes on. While at the doctors office, he gave me a 5mg Xyzal. It cleared up my nose within the hour and I could breathe the rest of the day. The doctor suggested taking Allegra 12 hour. So I bought some, and planned on taking it the next day. That night I was really tired before bed. Went to sleep. I woke up about 7am and stayed in bed almost the entire day. I was completely drained of energy. At 3pm i took the Allegra . The package says non drowsy. By 4pm I was so weak I felt like I was getting anesthesia. I had to be at work by 5pm. I drank some tea, hoping the caffeine would help. For the next few hours I struggled hard. I was completely drained of energy and my head felt foggy. It was horrible. At the 6 hour mark, I was less tired. Woke up today and decided not to take another one. What a nightmare that was. So much for non drowsy",Rich

Prior to starting Allegra I had never experienced anxiety. Overnight I started having panic attacks. My ears starting ringing all the time and I started getting this tingling/numbing in my left arm. I also started waking up with swollen hands, feet and face. I saw many doctors for these symptoms, I was in my mid 20's. Nobody could figure it out. I recently had been talking to a new allergist about all the issues and realized the correlation between days I take the med and waking up swollen so I Googled the side effects. I was horrified to see the reviews!! One lady even wrote an entire article about the tingling issue. I stopped the medication immediately and am starting to feel like my old self again.

12,Allegra,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 12, 2020",22,"So, my body has a very high natural histamine level, which means that I will break out in hives with feet and hand swelling almost every day. There’s no cause, my histamine levels tend to just be high. A long time ago, my sister used to use this medicine for the same condition. Therefore, when I started breaking out, my mom recommended this to me. As soon as I started taking it, it was truly a miracle. It works so quickly and efficiently to relieve my hives and remove the swelling to allow me to be able to walk on my feet properly. I have zero side effects. It’s just a medicine that does its job, no drowsiness, no nausea. I accidentally double-dosed once and not a single problem happened. It’s an incredible medicine.

I am doing a trial run of going without Allegra and also Cerazette to see whether bloating goes down. It's brilliant for my allergies without a doubt, the pro's outweigh the cons however I cannot continue gaining weight. Within 6 months of taking these alongside Cerazette daily I have gained 1st.

I've never had any drowsiness issues with Allegra.I have noticed that it takes about two hours to get the maximum benefit although starts to work in 20 minutes.  It does lose potency after 7-8 hours.  I sometimes cut the pills in half so can you extend the effect a little longer. It does provide excellent relief.  For extreme pollen levels, I think Zyrtec or Xyzal are a little stronger. But, I would try this because it seems to less side effects if you have not been a regular antihistamine user.",NCResident
