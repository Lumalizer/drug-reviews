Antihistamines don't work very well for me, and give me weird side effects. I used to get regular sinusitis, and allergy induced asthma.

After about a month of using it, I had to stop due to extreme dryness and pain inside my nose. I've never experienced symptoms like this before taking Flonase.

6,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 6, 2021",14,"I am horrified after seeing these negative reviews.. and mad at myself for trusting many doctors for many years. !! They kept me on Flonase for 15 yrs.  I was on it constant as well as Allegra.  I can’t count the number of times I asked are you sure a steroid nasal spray is ok to use everyday and won’t have side effects?. Resounding answer was always no, perfectly safe. I kept taking it all those years because I thought rhinitis was the source of my headaches. Flash forward, I got very sudden vision problems . I had always had 20/20. Optometrist said it was age (I don’t think 45 is that old). Then years of increasingly debilitating headaches that no medication (not even narcotics) would touch. I never correlated this to Flonase. 3 weeks ago, 10/10 headache woke me up, vomited, almost went to ER (again), dizziness . Made appointment to get MRI then found this site! FURIOUS. CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT NEEDED. !!!",Allergic24x7

I can't believe it took me this long to realize all the problems I been having it was because this stuff I started with heart palpitations, pressure in my neck, high blood pressure really bad vertigo I ended in the ER twice and I started to notice every time I take it I was feeling anxiety and I had panic attacks. I never suffered from any of this problems. They recommend again after my last vertigo attack and I was feeling worst every time I’ll take it. I started reading the reviews in another page.

9,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 4, 2021",9,"Like another reviewer, I developed daily, severe headaches that started at the base of the skull and neck and then traveled up the whole head.  I had a deep pain in the nasal cavity and a horrible, dry cough.  I don't think the cough is from the allergies, I think it's from the spray. The headaches are definitely from the spray as every time I try to use it, I develop them.  I threw it in the garbage.  My primary care doctor loves to tell me that it ""all stays in the nose"" and doesn't enter the rest of your body systemically which is total bull.  How else could it cause glaucoma then and such a huge range of other symptoms that so may people have reported?  Mine went in the trash can!",Anon
10,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,2.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 24, 2021",1,"I have had serious sinus/allergy issues for the past 25 years. 2 sinus surgeries ( 1 disastrous ) so I may not be your 'typical' example. I've taken Flonase, Nasacort, even Prednisone drops for extended periods of time, some of them for years. I recently stopped using Flonase and have noticed the following changes : Sleeping much better, feel calmer, skin far less irritated, long term mucous cough improved by 80%, scratches healing quicker.  It's still early days but I have to question the claim that nasal steroid sprays are topical and not absorbed by your system. In future, I will try to avoid using steroid nasal sprays especially on a long term basis.",Denwal

Never could find out the problem, so keep in mind my heart rate went down after the gave me nitrogen, kept me over night to monitor me on a heart monitor again it’s fine. Keep in mind I have post nasal drip, so Flonase is one of my medication. Ok haven’t had it at all in the hospital heart rate fine, so now I’m being discharged the nurse comes in and bring me the Flonase because I never had it in there. So I take it now I’m discharged going to the car my heart races, it wasn’t until I got home check my heart rate was 108. The only medication I had was Flonase.

14,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 23, 2021",3,"I have been on Flonase for a little over 2 years. I hadn't noticed any issues until here recently. I contracted COVID-19 in January of 2021 and like many people lost most of my sense of taste and smell. After 6 months, it really hadn't returned. After Covid, I started having daily mild nosebleed. A few weeks ago I started getting sinus headaches, specifically after trying a generic flonase and then back with nameNbrand flonase a few days later.  I decided to go off of flonase 3 weeks ago. No more sinus headaches. My nasal bleeding is less. My sense of smell and taste are back full swing but not quite normal after just 3 weeks of being off flonase. I about cried when I could smell a bar of soap or bacon cooking. I thought I was a long hauler with Covid19, but it seems it was flonase. My experience might not be the same for everyone, many who had Covid19 do lose their taste and smell as a result of the virus, that just wasn't the case for me.",Allergy3000
15,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 16, 2021",39,"Thank God I looked at these reviews! I thought I was going nuts thinking it was just me that all of this was happening to, and swore it was the Flonase that was causing me issues! My allergist actually had me doing 2 sprays in each nostril TWICE a day!!! I noticed that I started gaining weight, after working hard to lose 40 lbs., I'm back up 25lbs!!! I started using it again after giving it a break due to nose bleeds and burning in my nostrils each time I used it. Plus it just wasn't working, and I was still congested no matter what I did! Also I suffer from anxiety issues, and couldn't understand why it seemed to be so much worse. All of these questions were answered by all of you who shared your experiences, and I want to thank you all so much. The bottle will be going in the trash as soon as I'm finished typing this review! No more Flonase, or the generic fluticasone, for me!",Fox7
16,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 8, 2021",1,"I began this medication 7 years ago.  Before that all I did was not breathe, sinus headaches, and all over miserable.  My doctor gave me this and I'm amazed by how quickly it works and once the 2 week period wore off, I was able to take it every other day, which I do now.  No side effects at all.  I have bipolar depression anxiety and ptsd.  I'm medicated for these problems so I can't comment on psychiatric side effects.  All in all, this med is a life saver for me.  Make sure you read very carefully the pamphlet that comes in the box to verify that you're using it correctly.  I tilt my head slightly forward, breathe in  and spray twice and breathe slowly outta my mouth.  As far as cost, I was shocked at how much the drugstores charge for this.  Fortunately I have Medicaid which pretty much covers everything with a zero copay.",HondaGurl
17,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,,"July 8, 2021",62,"My allergies/post nasal drip were at their worst, so I decided to try Flonase out of desperation.  The first day or two I noticed immediate relief for my post nasal drip symptoms - but then the following days I began feeling extremely fatigued & anxious.  I've suffered from anxiety & depression in the past and have it under control, so I am always aware when my mental health is feeling off - and the only logical explanation for this change was the introduction of Flonase in my system.  I stopped using it immediately, and feel as though I am experiencing withdrawal symptoms - headache, fatigue, brain fog, anxiety - I would've thought I was going crazy, but was so relieved to see that others had similar experiences with Flonase.  I'm feeling a bit better each day, but from past experiences with anxiety, I know it will take a bit of time to feel back to normal.  In conclusion, I'd much rather deal with post nasal drip than have my mental health sent into a tailspin!",Mandy
18,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 31, 2021",9,"This was taken daily caused increased appetite, cravings and rapid weight gain. Gained 70 lbs in 2 years, all can be contributed to months where taking this was a constant daily with Allegra. Once both were discontinued weight gain stopped and was able to lose weight. When both continued (as per Dr.) weight gain began again despite dieting, exercise plus having an active job and am not sedentary. Both cortisteroid nasal sprays and antihistamines have been studied separately and shown to cause weight gain, yet neither drug lists it as a side effect. If obesity runs in your family, STAY AWAY!Additionally, it did NOT help my allergy to mold. I still have chronic post-nasal drip and congestion. I still got severe hay fever 6x last year despite taking these drugs nearly daily.",owlcat

The way it sits in the hand, it naturally gets blocked by a finger and just dribbles the stuff instead of spraying. Half the time you overcome that obstacle, it barely sprays anything anyway.

20,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,,"February 8, 2021",13,"I suffered from stuffy nose, headaches and ears aching for 3-4 years. Numerous sinus infections, antibiotics and visit to Dr and ENT. Nasocort didn't do much, Flonase works! I was hesitant at first as I don't like taking meds- side effects, allergic reaction, etc. My experience has been great, it worth trying if you have tried other things. Its safe and effective.**Side note. 2 years ago we installed a humidifier in our furnace system to keep moisture levels up. GAME changer!! No sinus infections since.Best of luck. Be safe and give it a try.",Nelson

22,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 18, 2020",12,"Flonase is possibly ok for intermittent use if your nose is completely clogged.  I do NOT recommend this for daily use as ENT's and Dr.'s suggest.  The more I used this, the more migraines and daily headaches I got.  I started feeling better not using flonase and told a Dr. this and he told me to keep using it.  So I started using it again, and back came the debilitating migraines.  Horrible ones for which nothing worked and for which I had to miss work. Will never go back to this.  Nasal rinse only.  Giving it 3 stars for the occasional use only.",blue-sky
23,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,6.0,,"September 23, 2020",33,"I used Flonase for a short period of time. I had very good results with relief of allergy symptoms, however just a few months later I developed very rapid onset cataracts in both eyes. I was just 61 they came on so rapidly and reduced my vision to the point I could not read labels at the grocery and actually became unable to drive, due to vision impairment I had surgery and lens implants ,my cataracts were the type that could return. That was Feb 2017 and thankfully,  I continue to have good vision and I am very healthy I have always wondered if the Flonase caused my cataracts, it is listed as a side effect , which unfortunately , I did not even realize that was a possible side effect until it was too late. I took no other medications and was in excellent health.  I was devastated but had a wonderful ophthalmologist MD . The surgery ended up costing me 10, 000 because I had very high deductible insuranceI threw away all of my Flonase and decided to never use it again",Bean

Didn't equate the pressure behind my right eye with this until I got a stabbing pain in my eye and went to the optometrist immediately. He said it's the nasal spray causing pressure behind the eye not in the eye and it is causing the dry eye. I read all the precautions again and ""eye pain"" is a symptom.",SnowBirdie
25,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 14, 2020",11,"Flonase has been amazing for me.  I began using it to stop my 17 year addiction to Afrin.It wasn't easy at first; I almost gave up.  But,  after about three weeks,  I noticed I didn't need to use the Afrin as much.  I used the Flonase exactly as directed and I think this made a difference.  My advice is to give it time!  I used both Afrin and Flonase the first few weeks.  I tried to really cut back on the Afrin and only use it if I had to (still led me to using 4xs per day).  One day I woke up breathing just fine and didn't reach for the Afrin, only used the Flonase.  For the rest of the day,  I didn't use Afrin! It's been 30 full days Afrin free!  I never thought I could kick it.  Be patient,  use it as directed and keep using it! I can breathe better,  wake up non-stuffy, can smell perfumes,  less sneezing,  less headaches, and best of all,  I don't have to tote around a bottle of Afrin everywhere I go! I use Costco brand and it worked like a charm and very affordable.",Rusty

I used it for 9 days. I was having panic attacks every day I didn’t know wth was going on it turned my life UPSIDE DOWN. Finally I figured out it was the Flonase so I stopped using it. The panic attacks stopped but the anxious feelings stayed, had insomnia, no appetite, lost 15lbs, couldn’t work. Literally flipped everything upside down.

Adhering to the recommended daily regimen of Flonase and Loratadine (generic Claritin) from November to March, my symptoms resolved without recurrence!   I was pleasantly surprised and thrilled that something worked when nothing else had during the previous seven years ever since we moved in our new house, which happens to be in close vicinity to a group of Cedar oak trees!

Oral antihistamines did very little for me, apart from make me drowsy and/or unable to sleep, and I seemed to metabolize them more quickly than predicted. I was taking them every few hours to maintain relief, but it was messing me up in other ways.Flonase was unbelievably helpful. During my bad season, I would take two inhalations in each nostril, twice per day. As long as I was consistent about its use, it would keep my nasal symptoms at bay. I had no side effects. The smell is a bit unpleasant and lingers, but not so severe in the grand scheme.My allergies are more mild now, but still keep Flonase around for bad days. I recommend to any and all.",CR

Not everything will work for everyone, but this worked for me.  I am thrilled!",MiamiLady17

It didn't stop my allergies at all, in fact, it worsened shortly after use. I had light nausea and heavy migraines shortly after taking it every day. I stopped taking it cause it was ineffective and due to the side effects. I've had allergies for almost a year. I'm going to try something else (Alavert). Claritin, Allegra, Flonase, Equate, Zyrtec, Benadryl, and Nasonex have all failed me so far.",Sarafare
55,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,7.0,,"March 21, 2017",23,"I have experienced outdoor/seasonal allergies all my life in fluctuating intensities. Sometimes I can can go without meds and then suddenly I'm so sneezy, itchy, watery, runny, and congested that I can hardly function. It's like a never-ending flu! So, I bought Flonase, fully aware that the relief wouldn't be instant. It took a day or 2 (literally) and I immediately had absolutely no congestion. I admit that I still sneeze and get a slight runny nose now and then but it was bearable compared to a Flonase-less reaction to pollen. The main con that I have a problem with is that I've been using Flonase for over a month and I have experienced absolutely no relief for my dry itchy (sometimes watery) eyes! Pros, my other symptoms are gone",Potata J

I'm lucky if I get 8.,Shebee60
57,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,,"January 29, 2017",29,This has changed my life. I had really bad allergies and would get sinus infections at least once every 2 months and everytime I was on a plane. I discovered flonase while on a trip and was at the end of my rope having antibiotics constantly and I tried the flonase as a last resort for some relief. It wasn't instant but the change was amazing. Since taking flonase i haven't had a infection since and have travelled extensively without any issue. I have recommended to a friend who has horrible allergies and it has helped her almost completely ease her symptoms and even stopped her snoring. Might not be for everyone but with regular use it has worked wonders for me,Anonymous
58,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,,"December 15, 2016",33,"Flonase SUCKS. The first two days I used it, I thought it was the greatest thing ever invented because my horrible allergies finally seemed to clear up. I forgot to take it one day and woke up in the middle of the night with a stopped up nose, so I took Flonase again as soon as I woke up. It was VERY ineffective that time. I got horrible headaches, insanely itchy eyes, a sore throat, and my mouth and lips were constantly dry. It has been a week since I've vowed to never use Flonase again, and I STILL have the WORST smell in my nose and mouth from that stupid allergy ""reliever"".

After a few day, the roof of my mouth got raw and sore and painful.  I did not rinse my mouth every time after use.  Maybe I should have. It was destroying my skin on roof of mouth.

63,Flonase,Allergic Rhinitis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 22, 2016",22,"Used it for a few months, once every morning. Works great to stop the allergies throughout the day, I've definitely not had the debilitating problems that come through now and again as if I caught a cold, and this definitely stops that from happening. But the piercing headaches are bad after a few minutes, so I have to take ibuprofen to get through it. Then, I am OK through the day, mostly, I can function. But after a while, a couple months, my whole body started to feel numb. Can't feel my back, arms, legs, hands, feet, shoulders, and numb in a way that I am not able to perform athletically. If I get hurt, twist a wrist or pull a muscle I can feel those kinds of things, but for coordination, I felt detached, weak, awful, angry, annoyed.","Numbs, yes, but whole body too"

They get so bad that my throat itches terribly, my nose runs profusely then it clogs up completely. Worst of all is how bad my eyes get red and tear up and itch and hurt all the time. It's a nightmare allergy wise living in south Texas because of the cedar pollen. I did some research and saw that Flonase is a type of cortical steroid so I bought some. Kenalog40 shots have always been my savior but since I lost my insurance I'm stuck with OTC. Tried Flonase as per the instructions. Within days every allergy symptom but my itchy red and runny eyes went away. I waited two weeks but no relief for my eyes. After doubling the dosage my eyes cleared up and now I'm allergy free.
