0,Kenalog-40,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,,"August 30, 2021",5,"I wish I had never let the NP give me this injection ! It messed with my hormones and gave me terrible anxiety and I felt like I had a bad UTI!!! I went it to see my doctor because I was tired of suffering from sinus pain and hay fever. It was discovered that I didn’t have a sinus infection so I was recommended to get the Kenalog 40 mg. I started to feel better from the sinus and hay fever but boy I am paying the price for that temporary relief!!  About a week after the injection I have had post menopausal vaginal bleeding, and cystitis, and gastritis. I was sent over to get a pelvic ultrasound. Those results determined that my cervix was a little thick, and now I’m going to see my gynecologist. I should have been warned of the side effects of this. It was a bad call for them to recommend this  to me being that I already have high blood pressure and Osteopenia. I know that some side effects are rare but you still should have a choice to be told before you take the shot.",Messed with Tex
1,Kenalog-40,Allergic Rhinitis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 19, 2020",3,Cleared my sinus inflammation. A side effect unfortunately is I’m left with a hard lump on my buttock at injection site 7 months later still present.,Cat
2,Kenalog-40,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 17, 2020",3,"I receive Kenalog 40 as an injection in my arm and within 1.5 weeks my nose is like a normal healthy nose again! I have a full sense of smell and no longer lose my sense of taste either, it’s absolutely glorious and is the only thing that makes me feel like a normal person with no nasal problems. It also definitely lasts longer than 3 months for me, it’s closer to 6 months in my experience.",Toad
3,Kenalog-40,Allergic Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 25, 2020",9,"In 2013, I got a kenalog 40 injection in left glute to treat severe chronic hay fever.  I just got one shot.One month later my hair started falling out  excessively.  I have lost 90 percent of my hair and my eyebrows are practically gone. I had super thick healthy hair and 'brooke shield"" thick eyebrows.  This is scariest most depressing situation.  Menstrual cycle is erratic excessive bleeding. I have spent thousands of dollars on endocrinologists and hormone specialists to treat this sudden hair shedding/loss caused by this drug. It has ruined my life.",PETRA
4,Kenalog-40,Allergic Rhinitis,7.0,,"October 25, 2019",9,"I had been dealing with a year and a half of sinus migraines, several rounds of antibiotics, OTC allergy meds, etc. and my sinuses never seemed to clear up from seasonal allergies. It was more like year-round allergies. My doctor recommended the kenalog shot and within 2 days, the sinus pressure went away, I didn't have migraines, and I felt normal. I don't recall having any shakes or other side-effects like that, but I DO have an indentation in my buttocks at the injection site. However, I recently discovered that I am sensitive to some adhesives in bandages so it may be from that instead of the injection. Also, it may be interesting to note that ~1mo after my injection I had 6 weeks of vaginal bleeding, not quite a period, not quite spotting. It went away on it's own, so I am curious now if that was related to the Kenalog shot or a different cause. About 2 months after that cleared up is when I felt the Kenalog effectiveness go away and I'm ""due"" for another shot.",mrr34
5,Kenalog-40,Allergic Rhinitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 1, 2018",8,"I lost my sense of smell several years ago due to chronic sinusitis.In March 2017, I had a shot of Kenalog in my right hip, resulting in the restoration of my sense of smell.  It was wonderful, but short-lived.  The shot lasted 3 months, and my ENT will only give it once a year due to the chance of necrosis.  I  had my 2nd shot in mid April (almost 2 weeks ago) and unfortunately, my sense of smell did not return.  Hoping that it will come back again.",gailkr
6,Kenalog-40,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,,"March 9, 2015",50,"I've had spring allergies as far back as I can remember.   I get severe sinus pressure, loose focus,  lose energy,  etc. The inflammation in my body makes my blood feel like it's on fire.  I get a Kenalog shot 1-2 times every spring and it has been more effective than anything I've every used in my life.  The world comes into focus and my body feels like it comes back to life throughout the course of the day that I get it.  Usually lasts 3-4 months for me and works wonders in my life.",Jayden2015

8,Kenalog-40,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,,"September 29, 2011",32,"After years of suffering through allergies (year round, anything in bloom, grass, trees, etc.), my doctor gave me a shot of Kenalog-40.  The shot lasts for 6-10 weeks and has relieved all symptoms.  I want to make sure that I don't over use it (as all other allergy medicine I build a tolerance to, and then it fails to work).",Benjamin C.
9,Kenalog-40,Allergic Rhinitis,10.0,,"June 25, 2009",31,I have dealt with allergies all my life and have tried everything under the sun to stop the agony. This is the only drug that works 100%. It is also one of the cheapest. Highly recommended.,Neno1313
