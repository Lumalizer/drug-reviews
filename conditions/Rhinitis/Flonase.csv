After 3rd day of one squirt in left nostril, I started getting anxiety and panic attacks. It worked great to relieve ear symptoms but definitely not worth the anxiety, and panic attacks.",Do Not Use This
3,Flonase,Rhinitis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 26, 2021",5,"The disappointing thing is how effective Flonase is at immediately reducing my sinus inflammation / congestion. I say this because - through trial and error - I've determined that Flonase causes me too many adverse effects to continue use. Much like an episode of anxiety, it comes with racing heart and jittery feeling. My impression is that many doctors are either unaware of how common this tends to be, or presume that a certain number of patients are hypochondriacs. To be fair, health-care professionals do have to deal with their fair share of hypochondriacs. But I would still make the argument that this medication is not ideal for patients sensitive to Steroids (in general). Which is a widely accepted side-effect of Steroid medications - you're not crazy!",fleurfleur
4,Flonase,Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 26, 2021",2,"I have chronic sinus congestion without explanation, and it interferes with me being able to use my new CPAP.  A friend recommended Afrin, and it works great, but my sleep specialist warned me to not use it more than three days in a row, and I haven't.  She also recommended that I switch to Flonase.  Well, I'm about to go to bed, and it's day 4 in my rotation, so I decided to try Flonase.  Well, instead of taking my congestion from 50% to 0% like Afrin, I now have a splitting headache, and my congestion went from 50% to 100%.  Now I won't be able to sleep at all, because I can't use Afrin tonight, and instead of being partially blocked (which I can kind of deal with), I am completely blocked.",daybreaker1998

I stopped and they all left. I tried it again couple weeks later, BOOM, 5th day - when it starts working - depression. A side note that other similar class nasal sprays did EXACTLY the same to me. So all steroids do this to me.",Lukas
6,Flonase,Rhinitis,1.0,,"September 5, 2021",3,"I already suffer with anxiety and allergies I've tried this the last two days and my anxiety levels have shot through the roof. Palpations, shortness of breath, elevated blood pressure. Unable to sleep until the early hours despite taking medication, then on edge all day long feeling anxious and irritable. If you're already suffering from anxiety issues I'd be very careful about taking this if at all. Whether it's had any impact on my nasal congestion I don't know because I've been overwhelmed with anxiety",Paddy
7,Flonase,Rhinitis,1.0,,"January 10, 2021",19,"I felt like I was dying. After using Flonase for a month, for the first time in my life I was experiencing anxiety and and panic attacks. Another night I was awoken by a horrible headache and  vomited. The flonase made it so hard to breathe I could only take shallow breaths and my heart rate was way higher than usual. The only thing so could focus on was my breath and what’s wrong with me, I would have never known it was the flonase causing this if I didn’t look up the side effects online.",DeviatedSeptum12

Then all the side affects started, anxiety, insomnia, thrush, headaches, etc.  I  switched back to regular  allergy meds zertec.  It took 2 weeks for the symptoms to subsided.   I wouldn’t recommend Flonase!  Keep away!",Pukulan
9,Flonase,Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 20, 2020",4,"I wouldn't recommend Flonase for vasomotor rhinitis or enlarged turbinates, it does nothing and can have significant side effects. Afrin works for those issues but long term use isn't recommended, better to have a procedure to address if possible. Thankfully the most noticeable for me was dry nose and nose ache, nothing much more, but could have contributed to ongoing insomnia and fatigue issues, hard to say. Had to take it after a procedure to reduce my inferior turbinates and sinuplasty for inflammation reduction.",Machina

13,Flonase,Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 26, 2019",8,Flonase will not dispense.  You have to VERY vigorusly shake the container.   The one in 20 times it will dispense does offer some relief.  It is very difficult to use flonase.,Stopped up

After a month of use with 1x a day of one spray per nostril, I lost my sense of smell.I am now on day 3 of not taking it, feel pretty tired, not feeling well. Hoping those feelings will pass and I get my sense of smell back. Currently my nose is still unplugged.

16,Flonase,Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 14, 2018",11,Flonase is absolute trash and did nothing to unstop my nose. I had to go back to the store and buy the generic Kroger brand and that was the only thing that gave me some relief. Flonase did not decongest either side of my nostril at any time and it was a horrible waste of money,Angel
17,Flonase,Rhinitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 12, 2018",27,"Flonase is NOT for treating allergies, it's for treating the inflammation in your nose caused by allergies, so I'm confused as to why people think it'll get rid of itchy/watery eyes and other symptoms. Confusing advertisement I guess. For nasal treatment it works just fine. As a nasal corticosteroid it can be used to treat nasal polyps over a period of time- which often happens with chronic infections/bad allergies. For that function it works well. I haven't had an issue with it. I'm usually able to breathe through my nose again within 15-20 minutes after application. Guess we'll see how it works over the long run.",RinaRivers
18,Flonase,Rhinitis,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 15, 2018",14,"I used Flonase for several months.  It seemed to be working well.  Then I started to get nosebleeds.

I also had a feeling of extreme restlessness, much like I would imagine restless leg persons are afflicted with.

21,Flonase,Rhinitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 21, 2018",11,Flonase has changed my life!!  Before using this I was blowing my nose at least 20 times a day and sneezing about a dozen times.  I would wake up in the morning and my nose would be so plugged I would stand in the bathroom and blow my nose for five straight minutes to get relief.  After only 2 weeks on this I now maybe blow my nose twice and day and have maybe sneezed twice total.  The only thing it hasn't helped with much are dry eyes.  I would highly recommend at least trying this to see if it works it has been wonderful for me!,JoBear

I had to stop, but both nostrils would clog completely shut without it, I have also severe nasal allergic reaction and swollen air passages/asthma. My Dr gives me Flonase by Rx.

25,Flonase,Rhinitis,10.0,,"October 26, 2016",21,"I had a cold that triggered some bad allergies. Constant sneezing, runny nose, one side of my nose constantly clogged, that awful itchy feeling in my nose that wouldn't go away. After my first dose of Flonase I didn't sneeze even once for the rest of the day! I am so pleased with the results. I'm on day 2 and have not had any noticeable side effects.In regards to another review that said that the 60 dose doesn't give you the full amount due to the ""priming"" sprays- in the little booklet that comes it, it says that they account for priming sprays in the dosage. So you aren't wasting any product by properly priming it.",Dayna R
26,Flonase,Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 20, 2016",33,"I got sick earlier this week with the flu, which triggered a sinus infection and bronchitis. My doctor prescribed OTC Flonase for the symptom of sinus congestion. I began taking Flonase, two squirts a day in each nostril, on Tuesday. While I was in the midst of the illness, with fever, body aches, and severe congestion and coughing, I did not think there was a problem with the fact that I could not taste or smell. It is the fifth day, however, and while my sense of taste has come back about 40%, my sense of smell has not come back at all. I became curious and looked up ""Flonase and sense of smell"" on the internet. Apparently, people are reporting loss of sense of smell when using this product. I hope mine comes back.",TuolumneDame5

Don't listen to the haters! This medicine is AMAZING! I told my dad about it, because he has allergies like me.

30,Flonase,Rhinitis,1.0,,"January 19, 2016",21,My doctor put me on this because my nose gets stuffy when I lay down and they didn't want me using Afrin. I've been on Flonase almost a week and I notice no difference. Sprayed each nostril every night....nose still stuffy. I can't sleep and it's going on 3am and I have to be up at 7. Nothing clears my nose as good as Afrin but it's bad for continuous use. So this stuff doesn't work.,TJP10987

But I have tried just about everything, Claritin, Allegra, Zyrtec, Advil & Tylenol Sinus, Nasacort, Rhino (something) and many others and nothing worked. The Advil Sinus and the old Tylenol sinus helped a little. My ear nose and throat doctor put me on Singular (pill). I bought this after see the commercials stating it blocks 6 types of allergies.

I don't take this all the time just when I sense allergy season, or plan to be somewhere, where there is a atmospheric change like the mountains or in an airplane. It keeps my sinuses from swelling, causing the headache, it's not an instant fix, it takes about 11 hours to be effective on me.",rod815

I added saline nasal spray and a humidifier to keep nasal tissue moist, and I'm down to 2-3 headaches a week at high pollen season, ears mostly behave themselves.

Because of prior condition in my sinuses in 2008 and inability to take the necessary antibiotic to resolve the condition, my sinuses were VERY FULL after this flu. I had severe pain in and behind my nose, under and above my eyes, etc. My ears felt like they would explode too. But, after these 5 days on Flonase and an antibiotic to treat the Sinusitis, I feel much better. I am, however, simultaneously taking supplements which aid in reducing inflammation and have altered my diet to dramatically reduce inflammatory-induced health problems.
