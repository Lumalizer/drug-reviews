2,Fluticasone nasal,Rhinitis,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 23, 2022",0,"Was prescribed this a few years ago.  I suffer from severe panic disorder and general anxiety disorder.  I was told that I had a sinus infection.  Started taking this.  I would take it for a few weeks out of the year and if I had symptoms I'd take it again, so I never took it constantly.  A year ago I told my doctor I was experiencing shortness of breath, just randomly.  She asked me if I was taking my flonase.  So I started taking it again.   She never told me to stop taking it, so I've been taking it for about a year straight. I stopped taking it recently because I read that it lowers immunity and with covid going around, I don't need that.  Fast forward 3 days and wow, I'm experiencing fatigue... brain fog.  Headache.  I hope it goes away because it's REALLY annoying..",Namaste

4,Fluticasone nasal,Rhinitis,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 25, 2021",0,"Hi. I started off with mild allergies that hurt my eyes. In 2015; I then started developing more moderate seasonal allergies that would clog my nose, but salt spray would help. Then in 2018 I developed really bad sinuses where I can't breathe out my nose, and it lasts all year. My nostrils get so dry that it make me unintentionally sleep with my mouth open at night, which has led me to becoming a 'mouth breather'",Sinus girl
5,Fluticasone nasal,Rhinitis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 26, 2021",5,"Flonase (fluticasone):The disappointing thing is how effective Flonase is at immediately reducing my sinus inflammation / congestion. I say this because - through trial and error - I've determined that Flonase causes me too many adverse effects to continue use. Much like an episode of anxiety, it comes with racing heart and jittery feeling. My impression is that many doctors are either unaware of how common this tends to be, or presume that a certain number of patients are hypochondriacs. To be fair, health-care professionals do have to deal with their fair share of hypochondriacs. But I would still make the argument that this medication is not ideal for patients sensitive to Steroids (in general). Which is a widely accepted side-effect of Steroid medications - you're not crazy!",fleurfleur

Well, I'm about to go to bed, and it's day 4 in my rotation, so I decided to try Flonase.  Well, instead of taking my congestion from 50% to 0% like Afrin, I now have a splitting headache, and my congestion went from 50% to 100%.

I've decided to stop using the nasal spray only after 4 days of usage due to anxiety symptoms. I was told to take 2x sprays on each nostril, but I took 1x each to be safe.

10,Fluticasone nasal,Rhinitis,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 1, 2021",0,"My doctor would prescribe Fluticasone every fall for about 3 years.  Never had any side effects BUT then something happened that my doctor knew about yet didn't tell me!  On July 4, 2018 I ended up in the ER, fighting to keep my eyesight!  Fluticasone can...and does....cause Glaucoma in both eyes!  If my doctor had told me this at any time during the 3 years she kept prescribing it, I would NOT have taken it!!  I love my eyesight more than a stuffy nose.  The ER opthalmologist who treated me was disgusted with the callousness of my doctor.  It took 6 hours to get ocular levels down to normal!  Before you take any nasal steroids, get an eye exam to rule out any signs of glaucoma.  I've since had 2 lasar eye surgeries (each eye) for the glaucoma, and cataract surgery in both eyes.  I can safely take Flonase again but choose not to because I have dry eye which started after cataract surgery.  Flonase does the same as Benedryl...dries me up.

13,Fluticasone nasal,Rhinitis,5.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 25, 2021",1,"Well... Flonase is certainly very effective, but you risk getting cataracts or glaucoma if you use it regularly for years. I had been congested my whole life until I started using Flonase. Nothing else had ever worked. Using Flonase, I finally didn’t feel worn out and tired from struggling to breathe all of the time. It was really great. Unfortunately, after five years I have developed cataracts. Research this- you’ll find that nasal steroid sprays are associated with cataracts and glaucoma.

14,Fluticasone nasal,Rhinitis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 25, 2021",1,"I had to make a trip to the E.R. That's when an MRI, and CT scan showed I have chronic sinusitis. My left sinus is full of infection. Over the years I just thought I had allergies and  antibiotics never worked. So I just took zyrtec, benadryl, sudafed etc. Relief was hit or miss most days.  For almost 3 weeks I've been using the generic flonase. Finally I'm getting some relief. The first morning after my first dose. I already had improvement. This medication is specifically for polyps and inflammation. Not for allergies as the pills are for allergies This is why they didn't help very much. I still have to wait for my next appointment to find out if I'm getting surgery, but this is holding me over till now. As I tried to flush my sinus and it wouldn't flush.

Confusing advertisement I guess. For nasal treatment it works just fine. As a nasal corticosteroid it can be used to treat nasal polyps over a period of time- which often happens with chronic infections/bad allergies. For that function it works well.

I've had doctors suggest regular nasal irrigation to rinse out the particles, but that only ever made me more sniffly. Got a prescription for Fluticasone a few months ago, and it was like magic.

Also muscle spasms around the eyes and I believe higher blood pressure though I  can't corroborate exactly. All symptoms have gone away since quitting. The one that's lingered the longest has been the increased thirst and urination. Apparently- this medication can raise blood glucose levels in blood and urine triggering diabetes.

I had severe pain in and behind my nose, under and above my eyes, etc. My ears felt like they would explode too. But, after these 5 days on Flonase and an antibiotic to treat the Sinusitis, I feel much better.
