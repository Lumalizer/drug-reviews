0,Keytruda,Colorectal Cancer,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 21, 2022",1,"My doctor tried this after everything else has failed. It didn't work, in fact it did nothing good what so ever. My CEA went from 479 to over 2000, the highest it has been since I got cancer in 2016. It might work for some but I haven't heard of it benefitting anyone. Good luck to those who use it.",ned2121
