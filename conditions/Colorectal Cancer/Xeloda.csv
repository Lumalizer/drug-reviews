0,Xeloda,Colorectal Cancer,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 7, 2022",1,"Vietnam combat veteran exposed to Agent Orange - began treatment for large tumor colorectal cancer while undergoing 9 weeks of radiation treatments ( took Xeloda for the 9 week period - eight 500 mg tablets daily).  This was followed by 4 months of recovery from radiation. Then 11 hours of surgery during pandemic lockdown in April 2020, followed by an additional 10 months of chemo/infusion treatments (took Xeloda during this 10 month period - same daily dosage).  I am now recovering from surgery and treatments and consider myself very fortunate. Thanks to my oncologist, my surgical team and Xeloda!!!!",LoneEagleOne
1,Xeloda,Colorectal Cancer,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 22, 2020",42,"I was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer in January 2020. I under went 6 weeks of Xeloda along with 6 weeks targeted radiation. The combination shrunk my tumour 1.5 inches which was considered a great success for when I had surgery in July of 2020. I had a bit of nausea and was very exhausted. Some tingling in my thumb and fingers. Also had some diarrhea occasionally. My hair has never been healthier .... zero hair loss.  At one point I had some mouth tenderness but never open sores. I have recently just finished 4 months of follow up chemo (xeloda)and currently recovering from side effects such as extreme fatigue , muscle aches ,limited nausea and diarrhea. Also I’ve had split and peeling skin on thumbs and fingers all in all my experience with Xeloda has been good. I’ve been told that there is zero sign of any cancer left , CT scan last week will tell the tale. Will know more early January but feeling very optimistic.",MeMaw
2,Xeloda,Colorectal Cancer,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 2, 2017",27,"I am in my 2nd month of taking xeloda after going through 36 rounds of chemotherapy since 2013. My intake of xeloda is 3 pills every twelve hours for 7 days and off 7 days. The side effect I am experiencing is the discoloration of the inside of my hands and the bottom of my feet, they also tingle and are painful at times. I am often tired and have also had pain in my shoulder and chest. I don't know if this medicine will keep the cancer from coming back, but I'd rather deal with these side effects than the chemo.",Rozeya
3,Xeloda,Colorectal Cancer,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 2, 2013",100,"Found out I had colon cancer and thought that was the end of me. Xeloda was very easy to take, twice daily for two weeks. One week off with testing.A small amount of tenderness in the mouth was the only problem, and that was minor. Only noticed it when I decided to try one of my diet favorites which is hot sauce.",Jim
4,Xeloda,Colorectal Cancer,10,,"February 4, 2012",87,"I have been on Xeloda since October 2011 and haven't had any of the side effects listed.  I have been able to maintain my appetite and haven't lost my hair.  Actually, my hair has thinned just a little, gained a little bit more body and is getting lighter.   This has been a very positive experience as far as chemo goes.  I definitely will do Xeloda again (If I have to).  There is a questionable mass on my lung...surgeon says cancer....oncologist no sure...and it is shrinking.  I'm unsure if it is related to the combination medication I was on or Xeloda.  I will hopefully determine that with this cycle of Xeloda on its own. ",Anonymous
5,Xeloda,Colorectal Cancer,8,,"November 18, 2011",98,"My father was diagnosed with stage four colo-rectal cancer one year ago. I'm thankful for Xeloda it has worked in shrinking the tumor on his colon, he has not lost hair, does not vomit or have constant diarrhea, is eating well and can still taste flavors of the food he eats, I thank the God for this.  But he does have other symptoms like pain and peeling on his hands and feet, blackness on his hands and bottom of his feet. I do notice he has chills, feels week and disoriented at times, body aches and his hearing is not as good as it was before.",vange
6,Xeloda,Colorectal Cancer,10,,"October 25, 2008",100,This drug saved my life. It eradicated my tumor and made it possible for me to have a much less extensive surgery than anticipated. I had very few side effects and the ones I did have were easily managed with medicine.,Oose
7,Xeloda,Colorectal Cancer,10,,"March 27, 2008",111,I had little to no side effects. It elimanated one tumor and slowed the grouth of the other.,Anonymous
