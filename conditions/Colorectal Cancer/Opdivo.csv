0,Opdivo,Colorectal Cancer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 18, 2022",0,"My brother was in the clinical trials.  His tumor had gotten bigger after Opdivo treatments, so he was dropped from the clinical trials. Months later, my brother's tumors ""APPEARED"" to have shrunk, so he was immediately put back into the trials, so his data could be counted.",Anonymous
1,Opdivo,Colorectal Cancer,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 27, 2021",0,I have been dealing with abdominal tumor growth for 15 years.  I started Opdivo three years ago after  two scans that showed tumor growth.  It kept my tumors from growing for 2.5 years.  I had almost no side effects.  Just occasional loose stools and occasional rashes that were not itchy and went away in a few days. I started taking it every 2 weeks and then moved to once a month. I was in and out of labs and infusion in 1.5 hours so I never needed to miss work.,Robyn
2,Opdivo,Colorectal Cancer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 26, 2021",0,Was out of remission and had to take radiation and Opdivo . The cancer was resolved by the radiation treatment not the Opdivo. What the Opdivo did was damaged not only my thyroid but my salivary glands as well and caused blisters in my mouth.,Sherry56
3,Opdivo,Colorectal Cancer,,,"January 9, 2018",9,"I have small intestines cancer/stage 4 .I have been on opdivo for 1 full year because I could not tolerate chemo any more. It took 9 months for pain relief and 4 months ago, my CT scan showed that my tumors have shrunk 30 percent.  Opdivo has saved my life ! I have only diarrhea as a side effect. I am so grateful that my dr. put me on this as I would not be alive . I have gained 20 lbs and don't feel as if i have cancer.  I can't wait to get my next CT scan",ilovetobyandvegas
