0,Depakote,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 31, 2022",0,"I'm epileptic I have been having seizures since my early teens I’m 52 now I was born with a tumor in my brain. The tumor has been removed but the damage of the scar tissue is causing me to have seizures. I have been taking Depakote 2000mg a day and I take with it Keppra 1000mg a day for 2 years and the side effects suck, I can’t sleep, I stutter, I’m always anxious and have tremors.  I have my ups and downs mood swings, I lost my hair, I’m easily angered or frustrated and nervous. I also have high blood pressure now and have to take high blood pressure meds. I smoke THC and CBD to help. I’m usually nauseous and I have digestive problems if you know what I mean. I still have seizures mainly blackouts I haven’t had a grandmal seizure for a bit. But I would like to know if anyone came down with high blood pressure when started taking the meds?",Eddie
1,Depakote,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2022",0,"This is the worst drug I have ever taken. I started off with double vision, muscle weakness and unstability so I could not walk, and dizziness. I fell and broke three ribs. I had hallucinations, aggressive behavior, anxiety, mood changes and paranoia. I was in the hospital when all this happened and they kept giving it to me. I tried to escape the hospital and the goon squad stopped me. One night I was convinced I was going to be kidnapped.  I had to go to rehab to learn how to walk with a walker. The rehab doctor cut the dosage and my mental health improved. They kept giving me opiates for my back pain. I also had other side effects such as back pain, runny nose, difficulty sleeping and constipation. When I finally got home I quit taking this stuff. In about four weeks I was back to normal.",topaz1456

3,Depakote,Epilepsy,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 27, 2022",0,"I have been taking 1000mg daily (500mg every 12 hour), for 12 years since I was diagnosed with Idiopathic Epilepsy. I had both petit mal and grand mal seizures. This was the first medicine the doctor prescribed to me and it is working. The only time I had a seizure was when I tried reducing my dosage to half without talking to my doctor. Once I got back to my regular dosage I got no more seizures. I do consume chocolate and caffeinated tea liberally, coffee (no more than a cup a day) and occasionally alcohol (but never in large doses) and this has not caused any seizures in my case while taking this medicine. Although I do have a milder form of epilepsy and most certainly I do not recommend or believe that doing this is safe for every epilepsy patient, this could be very dangerous or fatal for some, I just know my limits well. I had mild side effects from this medicine, such as the occasional tremors when tired but nothing more. I am satisfied with it.",Anonymous
4,Depakote,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 16, 2021",0,"WORST EXPERIENCE. I suffer with epilepsy and was prescribed this with various medications due to my active seizures that regularly happens 2-3 times a month when I was still in high school (age 14-18)This medication didn't help at all. Instead it messed up my mood. I was a teenager when I was first prescribed with it and it drove me crazy as I wasn't able to handle the side effects. My friends and teachers felt bad and most can tell the sudden mood changes when I'm taking it. One time the teacher actually thought I was consuming an illegal drug / alcohol. Side effects: 1. Didnt help with my seizure at all 2. Super Aggressive (Reduces depression but makes you aggressive) 3. Weird sleeping patterns 4. Bad memory. Really effects your memory 5. Increases heart rate and anxiety 6. Hallucinations For those suffering with epilepsy, I recommend another drug because I think depakote focuses more for moods (bipolar n depression) instead of seizures.",Mbap123

Initially doctors thought I was having seizures at age 53. I had to consult with three neurologists before one came to the conclusion I didn’t fit the clinical context of seizures. The only credible diagnosis seemed to be adrenal insufficiency causing blackouts. I may have had an underlying undiagnosed issue but would be very cautious with this drug.,Mr. Misdiagnosed

I was on keppra 1000mg 2x daily I was losing a lot of weight 150 to 129. I had a seizure that caused full body paralysis. Usually only happened on the left side of body. I suffered 2 strokes then started having seizures after 1 year ago. I was diagnosed with a blood disorder that causes clots hence the strokes. Then seizures.

I continue to exercise at least 3 days a week. I mention my exercise habits for a reason.

First of all, at the dose I was taking, it had so many negative side effects, it was amazing I made it through college and graduated. The side effects at the dose I was taking were very severe. The side effects were depression, weight gain, foot drop, stuttering, tremor, and kept you in a constant haze. I had all these  exponentially worse than people who take smaller doses.

I decided to take matters into my own hands and reduce my dosage. I have been taking 250 mg now for 35 years with no seizures.

I decided to switch to Keppra XR because of potential liver issues with Depakote and the somewhat tiresome redundancy of labwork related to Depakote use.  Keppra XR did not work for me as my memory began growing progressively worse and I could not think clearly.  I also began losing my train of thought mid sentence fairly often.  Switched back to Depakote ER, and am feeling much better mentally.  The quarterly labwork is not a big deal when compared to being in a mind fog for over a year.

37,Depakote,Epilepsy,,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 15, 2014",26,I was put on Depakote when I was 17 when I started to have seizures due to head trauma from a motorcycle accident.

When I've ran out of the medication and went out and drank (like an idiot) I had a seizure the next day. This happened to me like 3 times but it's my own fault. Anyway as long as I take it daily and control any other factors that could cause a seizure I'm seizure free. I've never had a seizure while taking this.

I also use the sprinkles. As for the weight gain I never really gained more than about ten pounds but I stay active and mainly keep it off, my doctor also put me on Topamax which helps balance out the weight gain because Topamax makes you lose weight and Depakote makes you gain so they both kind of cancel each other out.

Went out drinking with friends while using Depakote and after only 2 margaritas, went home and had a grand mal seizure (first in 9 years).  Otherwise, only other drawback to this medication is the price.",Anonymous

He craves corn and strawberries like you wouldn't believe. He eats can after can of corn and crates of strawberries. At least it's healthy food, he isn't overweight. He also started having symptoms of ADHD and Autism (behavior problems). Most ADHD medication does not go with Depakote. We got the seizures under control only to have other problems. Also, you should ask your doctor to do blood checks every 3 months to rule out any other complications from this medicine.",jeckac

57,Depakote,Epilepsy,8.0,,"June 13, 2008",25,I was on Depakote for 17 years with little to no breakthrough seizures. Then I suddenly developed leukopenia and had to be removed from the drug. I have not found another medication that has been as effective as Depakote. I am presently on Carbatrol and have had breakthrough seizures monthly and after 7 years have again developed leukopenia from it.,dskeller
58,Depakote,Epilepsy,8.0,,"May 8, 2008",48,My 9 year old daughter has used Depakote for 2 years now for seizure disorder. I am happy with it as there are little side effects. We increased the dose when a seizure occurred. When the dose is high enough it helps with her migraines as well. She gained 5 pounds but we keep it down with a healthy diet. ,Anonymous
