1,Gabapentin,Epilepsy,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 6, 2019",2,"Had been on Dilantin/Mysoline for years for my epilepsy with good success in controlling seizures.  Doc decided to add Gabapentin to the mix and ended up in ER with  seizures coming in waves.  Never happened before - only had nocturnal seizures every couple of years - one  at a time - not multiples.  After  coming off  Gabapentin, meds back to Dilantin/Primidone -- no seizures in past 20 yrs.",Zar

9,Gabapentin,Epilepsy,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 24, 2013",16,I've been on this medicine for 10 yrs now and have my seizures under control with 1200 mg a day a neurologist placed me on it after trying Dilantan and Depakote. I didn't realize it could be helping my anxiety and restless legs and migraines. I had terrible headaches before I was on gababentin and now have all these things under control. I did gain 30lbs when we added a antidepressant.,gimpy gypsy
10,Gabapentin,Epilepsy,8.0,,"September 18, 2011",17,"I am 30 years old, and I have epilepsy.  I just came off of Tegretol and only on gabepentin after asking my neurologist if I could please.  At single doses of 600mg 3 times a day, I feel like my anxiety goes away, but my head can feel groggy.  I actually have panic attacks, anxiety attacks, depression as a result of epilepsy.  I do like Gabapentin if it prevents seizures.  Last night I felt nuts, and racing thoughts.  Maybe I need to up my doses to 1200mg at night instead of 600mg.  I do sleep very well once I do crash.  It can make me a calmer and hungry.  I couldn't survive, literally, without it. I know I would have seizures and panic attacks.  Side effects...very few compared to Tegretol.",Anonymous
