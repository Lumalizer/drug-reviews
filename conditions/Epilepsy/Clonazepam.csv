0,Clonazepam,Epilepsy,10.0,,"March 31, 2022",0,"Clonazepam is a life saver for me. Other benzodiazepines like Xanax were too harsh and had a super short half-life. This medication has the longest for me. If you don’t take one for a couple of days , it’s ok. It doesn’t give you harsh withdrawals. No seizures and no anxiety! A winner in all categories for me.",Drdrmusic
1,Clonazepam,Epilepsy,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 11, 2022",0,I took clonazepam for about ten years and it calmed down my brain to enable me to sleep soundly. I was admitted into hospital a year ago and the doctor changed my medication from clonazepam to Keppra liquid  Keppra has a foul taste but seems to control epilepsy better than clonazepam,cjw1947

3,Clonazepam,Epilepsy,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 13, 2020",17,"Klonopin (clonazepam):If you are having trouble withdrawing from this drug, declare war with yourself and exercise like you have never exercised before. With an understanding of what the drug does to the brain, you have to fight for it back. Yes, it's hard the hardest painful workout I ever did.I went against doctors' advice, and the doctor told me to keep doing it on the next visit.And make this part of your life till the day you are no longer on this earth.Keep fighting the war against addiction.I wouldn't wish benzos use on my worst enemy.Good luck.",wayne3443
4,Clonazepam,Epilepsy,9.0,,"December 8, 2019",10,"clonazepam is a life saving drug. It broke my constant partial seizures and reduced them by 99%. It also helps me not be anxious, controls my mood swings, and prevents my migraine aura headaches. My only complaint is it makes me a bit emotionally numb and my memory is a bit affected, but the pros far outweigh the cons. Very cheap where I live too",Kas
