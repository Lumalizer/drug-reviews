2,Carbamazepine,Epilepsy,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 17, 2021",0,"Tegretol (carbamazepine):In the early 80's my five year old daughter was being treated by a top children's neurologist for focal seizures which she started having after a severe, undiagnosed life threatening illness at 4 months. She was changed from dilantin to tegretol by this doctor who I had great respect for when I told him the side effects from this drug were harming my child. She couldn't remember anything, she acted dazed and confused, she scared me concerning her development while taking tegretol. We fought over changing the drug which he said was new and better than dilantin. I said I don't care she doesn't act like this on dilantin and I'm not leaving your office until you change it. So now I read these side effects and I was right. I still love that doctor but I knew my child too... And also My other kid reacted better to Rondec syrup for bronchitis than that Albuterol new drug they changed her to, it was absolutely clear to me that while new drugs are wonderful and I am grateful for them, new needs monitoring",Grannyfae

Through the years, I was prescribed other medications that weren't effective. I was eventually prescribed Tegretol, but there was the daily ""peak and valley"" with the medication level, which wasn't helpful. Once I was prescribed Tegretol-XR, I felt a million times better! Since taking it, I've been seizure free for about 25 years. My only complaint is that the medication can be difficult to find consistently, and it is expensive.",Patrick
4,Carbamazepine,Epilepsy,4.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 16, 2021",2,"Prescribed for my epilepsy and was consuming this along with keppra for 3 years. I recommend carbamaz to be taken for people with mood problems instead of epilepsy.  Because it doesn’t really help prevent your seizures, however it helps maintain your mood. My seizures never stopped and the medication was useless for them. Didn't even help with anxiety. Sadly, dependency rate starts increasing after 8 months of daily usage, more dosage is needed every 6 months and its withdrawals where so hard on me. Never had a problem with bipolar or anything like that, however carba’s withdrawals really messed up my sleeping pattern and mood (depression and anger). Eventually, my epilepsy got worst due to carbas withdrawals effect. Wouldn't recommend this drug for kids or teenagers.",Mbap123

But as I got older, add on drugs were needed. Then in 2014, I could not stop eating. I was always hungry, yet loosing weight. I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. And I was put on medication for that. In 2016, my doc took me off tegretol and replaced it with lamictal. Once off the tegretol, my thyroid started to function normally. And medication for my thyroid was no longer needed. It’s not a bad drug. But your body changes over time. Another negative about the drug was how frequently I had to urinate. I would have to go at least 15 if not more times a day. Towards its discontinuation, I was on  1200mg of it daily.",Scott

It lasted for only about 0.005 secs. And then gradually increase. Now I have attacks that last for hours (the longest one lasted 9 hrs).I used to consult ortho docs since I did not not know what it was. They kept telling me I had muscle cramps. Because I do martial arts I believed it. But at last I consulted a nuero when once I had a bad attack and the ortho doc was on leave. He diagnosed me with exercise induced paroxysmal dystonia. He prescribed tegretol and I started on a low dose. It didn't seem to help me. I gradually increased its dose and now I don't get those attacks!

Just as long as you take it vigilantly and sleep regularly. There are two things that keep this medication from being a ten. The first is the fact that your body becomes resistant to the effects of the medication resulting in a never-ending dosage increase to maintain your results.
