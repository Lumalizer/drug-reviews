0,Levetiracetam,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 10, 2022",0,"Just wanted to do a follow-up to my comment @ 14 months ago. I am now on 400mg daily of Vimpat.  I am no longer on levetiracetam however I am still experiencing side effects of levetiracetam cognitive issues/confusion/dizziness/lightheadedness/anxiety/depression.  I worked corrections & was a go getter & very good at my job, now I don't want to leave the house & struggle at jobs.  I have had 3 EEG's & 1 MRI, I still have seizure activity & medical professionals I have discussed my side effects I had with levetiracetam state I may never get back to my normal self.  My neurologist has never addressed this possibility and told me 14 months ago nobody has problems with Keppra/levetiracetam.  Please advocate for yourself when encountering med change",R.O.Y.
1,Levetiracetam,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 19, 2022",0,Keppra (levetiracetam):For us Keppra was not the right medicine. My son started on this medication at 6 months old and was on it till about 2.5 years old. It didn't seem to help with seizures and also seemed to cause aggression issues. Once we removed this medication his over all attitude changed for the better.I will say that while on it one thing that helped with the aggression was B6 vitamin.,jshipwash

I had almost 160 seizures during the pregnancy plus I was a horrible person to be around due to the constant irritability. It was horrible. My son was delivered early to try to get me on a better medicine. My doctor suggested we try it again after the pregnancy and it still didn't work. Horrible medicine!,Lynn
4,Levetiracetam,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 8, 2021",0,"Keppra (levetiracetam):This 'Med'/Keppra/Brivatiracetam always been Neuro's 1st choice since diagnosed in 2008 for 'Opiate induced Epilepsy' @30 (3000mg's). Not helped 'Absent' or 'Nocturnal Seizures'! Would take any 'Med' to avoid Sleep-Wandering, biting Mouth to shreds & various injuries when awaken. Keppra = No Thanks..The SIZE of the Tab's are scary enough, increased anxiety, zombified 24/7, terrible lethargy, that KEPPRA RAGE & negative feelings as others have described.. (Tegretol, Clobezam + Zebinix are helping more tbh)The gut feeling with others experiences on this 'Med' confirms suspicions. Bless all..",Nicky Cotton
5,Levetiracetam,Epilepsy,5.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 10, 2021",0,"Keppra (levetiracetam):I was prescribed this drug after my first episode, didn't have the second seizure until three years later after missing a couple of doses. So I assume it worked well and I didn't suffer any physical side effects as my doctor kept monitoring the drug level through blood tests until she found the right amount.HOWEVER, this drug literally made me a very horrible person, a bad guy, someone that I remember and I feel disgusted by, I feel embarrassed. I ruined some relationships and career opportunities. I was put into SSRIs and they didn't help but made things worse. I was in a rage all the time, I call it KepprageAfter another violent seizure, I was prescribed Lamictal which counterbalanced Keppra's psychological side effect",Anonymous
6,Levetiracetam,Epilepsy,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 8, 2021",0,"Keppra (levetiracetam):Keppra has been the only thing that controls my seizures. It is dangerous at higher doses. It gave me suicidal fantasies and a bi polar like personality. When I lowered the dose I feel more stable with a joy for life, but I am so fatigue 24/7. After taking it 20 years my memory is shot and I am scared I am going to get early onset dementia. However, an Epileptic has to think about surviving each day without having a seizure in a dangerous circumstance that could kill or seriously injure themselves and others. So although Keppra is not perfect by any means and it will take a lot of experimentation for the right dose, it gave me the best chance at a normal life, seizure free.",A NAME
7,Levetiracetam,Epilepsy,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 18, 2021",0,"Keppra has worked so far for the last 14 years. When compared to the other 1 AED (lamictal) that I've been on, its the better choice. But, if you are on it or about to start taking it, make sure to look at other options. Whether your male or female Keppra will negatively affect your sex life and will seriously impact your ability to reproduce. I wasn't aware of this side effect until recently but it has affected me since I started. As a result I'm now infertile. Also in todays society if sexual relations in a relationship are on the rocks, a relationship will most likely end in at least 1 partner cheating. Also avoid lamictal as the FDA has a warning on the side-effects (kidney disease). It also causes cognitive impairment ie symptoms resemble those of dementia. Every 4 years I have to decrease the lamictal dose by 100mg due to the side-effects. Klonazepam as well as any anti-depression AED also can cause infertility.",Tuner9069

First month was a bit rough as I felt disoriented and fatigued. Had a bit of a hiccup when my NOT so usual doctor switched me to immediate release generic. That was terrible!  Suicide ideation, anger, and hostility. Life was really awful within 24 hours on that crap!  Even got in trouble with the law by day two!  Knowing that wasn’t me, I went back to my regular and much loved doctor. Although not covered under my HMO, I needed my doctor and Keppra XR Brand. I have no side effects other than I sometimes feel a little euphoric about an hour after my morning dose. Very satisfied with the results and living my best life.",Livingwell

11,Levetiracetam,Epilepsy,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 16, 2021",0,"I have been taking keppra for almost 19 years and it saved me but at a funny cost.After the first keppra rage, strange thing, everything is fine and then I would get feelings of anger and when ever it did, I had no reason to feel angry like standing in line etc. After 4 month's on taking 1000x 2 twice a day, I became  seizure free  and have been for over 18 years . Never had any good control on any other medications in the past , but when I would suddenly get feelings of anger I begin to see that keppra was speeding up my thinking and made me realize I now had more time to think . Aura's started about 3 month's ago, see if the DR wants to up my dose , age may be due to this . amazing drug though works well .",bjo

Every bottle I’ve received from the CVS store is cut short one 2 tablets.When this happens it throws my refill off by at least 2 days. Sadly now I’ll be short once more. I received a letter stating my insurance will not be covering this script. How in the world will I survive without my seizure medication. Currently take two different medication to keep my seizures under control. Can you please explain?

I’ve had no side effects yet. I was switched off of Topamax after recording more than 24 side effects on the minimum dosage of 25mg. I ended up being allergic to it, and it was so bad for me.

On Keppra I suddenly became an AGGRESSIVE and ANGRY person. I did not realize this at first, but soon realized I was yelling at everyone and have explosive anger towards the smallest circumstances.

This year (2020) my neurologist decided as I am getting older Dilantin will not be good for my bones.  My neurologist put me on levetiracetam. I have never taken off brand/generic because there is just the slightest difference.  Well, where to begin with issues I had with levetiracetam.  I looked, literally, like the walking dead and could count every bone besides the anxiety, moodiness, loss of appetite,  weight loss (30 lbs), snapping at my dogs, cats & family for no reason.  I checked off each & every side effect AND made my own additional list.  Couldn't work because the side effects were so bad.Severe side effects. Worst med I have ever taken!!!!!",roy2004

20,Levetiracetam,Epilepsy,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 10, 2020",3,"Keppra (levetiracetam):I have sadly had a love/dislike relationship with Keppra. Almost right away after starting it after being diagnosed with simple partial seizure epilepsy, almost all symptoms I had been dealing with were gone. Within a week it was amazing to have a day without constant headaches, feeling dizzy, seeing flashes of lights, etc.Starting Keppra, it was discussed between my doctor and I and my spouse that it has a common side effect of causing what she referred to as ""Keppra Rage"". Fortunately for me, I did not experience that. Unfortunately, it did cause me crippling anxiety to the point I couldn't sleep with a blanket, and would commonly feel the urge to run outside because it felt like what I would guess a panic attack would feel like. Without that one side effect, Keppra would be my best friend. I would encourage people to try it if offered however.",Kyler532

I suffer with epilepsy and several types of seizures. would recommend keppra control and prevent upcoming seizures.I would def recommend keppra for people suffering light seizures or epilepsy consuming medications daily to PREVENT attacks. However, you will NOT be able to rely on it during ur heavy attacks. You would need diazepam Rectal tube or seroquel to immediately calm u down within seconds. Advice, pls take note to ALWAYS have an emergency medication as when ur loved ones under a sever epilepsy attack u would be able to help them with diazepam rectal tube 5mg or seroquel tablet which immediately calms them down within seconds - Stops the hallu, anxiety, seizures and calms u down. Take note to ONLY take it WHEN NEEDED as those medications are highly addictive. If ur on keppra.

24,Levetiracetam,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 26, 2020",37,"Keppra (levetiracetam):When first put on keppra, things seemed to be fine. But over time, when I had my annual neuro appointment and I’d tell them of any seizures I’d had that year, they’d up the keppra dosage. And the more keppra I took, the more seizures I had. I didn’t realize that till later. At one point I was on 4000mg (?too much?) of the XR version daily. That’s when I figured that the keppra was the culprit to more frequent seizures. And the after effects of a seizure while on that dosage lasted for days. They were major depression, headache and minor after shocks like another seizure was going to happen. In the past three years I’m working my way slowly off this drug. Now no longer on the XR version, just regular immediate release pills. On 500mg a day. I have less seizures. And if I do, I recover from them within an hour or so. One more thing. On the Keppa XR, keppra rage was no joke. I’d be fine. The out of the blue, just all hateful and mad for no reason.

I mistake them for Auras sometimes which just heightens the sense of dread.Occasionally I accidentally miss a dose and wonder why I feel so happy that day, then it hits me...I feel like reading these reviews has helped me to come to a decision to change, so thanks everyone. That being said I'm sure this could work for some people, so don't be scared of it as a medication, just be aware that if your mood changes or you start feeling depressed that it's not just you turning in to an awful person and could be the medication.Also I'm in the UK, so NHS will change my meds for free no qualms.

Made me get aura seizures when I was still asleep and it would wake me up! Made me feel suicidal also.  I took the medication for about six months and have had more than enough of it. Was  tired each day I could barely get up to do normal things, even to cook. I decided to wean off myself,  I decreased dose to half a tablet in morning, hoping it would stop at the very least my aura seizures in my sleep, but it didn’t help.
