1,Lamotrigine,Epilepsy,2.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 7, 2021",0,"I was prescribed Lamotragine a few years ago now for an alternative drug for my epilepsy.This drug doesn’t seem to work either but is very good for giving me anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts. I have already tried to take my own life once. This said, the Mental Health team subsequently asked me if (bluntly speaking) I would think of doing it again or actually do it again but I couldn’t give a 100% no. This along with my irregular sleep pattern, feeling depressed and next to no motivation and double vision from time-to-time makes me angry and frustrates me knowing that I have been prescribed drugs for a condition that seems to unearth others that have pretty much always been dismissed let alone even thought of. Anxiety is the worst. I’m constantly on edge. I just finished a course that deals with anxiety and it’s early days but  if I’m honest, doing the methods learned I can say they will probably not work and inappropriate to do in public without stares from others.",Richie

This is the first medication that was prescribed to me and I can confidently say that this experience has been as awful as when I had shingles. I had a headache that never went away, body aches, chills, a cough, and fevers that turned into a rash all over my face and body. Benadryl and steroid cream (as harmful as it is) used to work wonders for me, but they're not doing anything right now to relieve me of the itch. I felt sick every day and the seizures continued to happen. I'm suffering so much that I wish I could go back to how I was before, even if I have to live with having seizures for the rest of my life.",lamictalsucks

Asked to change after a month as I was sleeping 18hours a day and having mood swings. The neurologist at first didn’t want to change my medication which infuriated me , she didn’t want to listen. I am now on Lamotrigine and I have all the side effects : insomnia, acne problem, low concentration, bad memory , can’t stand light or noise. I am refusing to take more than 100mg a day for that reason. I am so scared to get another seizure (I didn’t have any since then but I have huge headache/migraines almost everyday) that I don’t want to stop them yet . But it changes who I am completely.

After another violent seizure, I was prescribed Lamictal on top of Keppra. I tried to refuse to take it but ended up taking it anyways (along with keppra). Once I reached 100mg bd all of the Keppra side effects were gone, and I felt like a different person.But like any anti-epilipsy medicine, there are side effects and I had two:1- I couldn't sleep more than 5 hours at night, I never used an alarm to wake up (you wish to need it once you reach this level)2- Dry mouth, nostrils, and eyes, dry to the point I can't open my eyes when I wake up and I needed an eye-drop to open my eyes.

Not had a grand mal for three years and have absence seizures but rare  no where near as much as I did.  This drug has caused very little side effects I can't even recall one to be honest and if anything it has gave me confidence to stand up for myself for some weird reason lol.

Initially when I went on it, I noticed increased anxiety but wasn’t sure if that was caused by the drug or simply that it was a very stressful time. I’ve always had some mood issues so for the last 4 years it’s been hard to know if the lamotrigine was a cause or not. I decided a couple of months ago I wanted to try coming off of it and switch to a different med to see what happened. Well, I didn’t like the new med so I had my doctor put me back on lamotrigine. I’ve been taking it for only 2 days at 25mg and my mood has been absolutely horrible. Severe anxiety, irritability and rage that comes out of nowhere. I have never had a seizure since taking it, so it has obviously worked well for that, but feeling this way is too great of a cost, so I will not be continuing.",Sam

Lamotrigine has worked well for me, reducing my simple partial seizure activity down to a once or twice a month (from 2-3 times a day). The only side effect I have had is making me tired, specifically while increasing my dosage (something that must be done very slowly), though even while on a steady dosage for awhile I still felt it a bit. However, discussing this with my doctor, discovered this comes in an extended release form, and unless I'm increasing the dose, no longer have any issues of feeling tired from this. I am currently taking 450MG a day. Be forewarned, I recently had to change healthcare coverage, and my new insurance company will not cover the ER form, and wanted me to go back onto the multiple times a day form.

Over the course of 9 months, I needed to adjust my medication from 500mg to 1,000mg; however, no seizures- thankfully. The one downside about the Unichem manufactures is a lot of pharmacies don’t carry it for Lamotrigine and need to put in a special order so sometimes you need to call multiple pharmacies to see how quick they can order it.

I am on a high dose (200mg morning, 300mg evening) but I don't notice any major side effects. Occasionally I have tremors in my hands in the morning, but only if I have had very disturbed sleep. In the UK lamotrigine is a ""first line"" drug, in that it is the best choice and most well tolerated of any other anti-epileptic drug.

44,Lamotrigine,Epilepsy,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 31, 2018",12,"I have used lamotrigine for 15 months, I have been seizure free on my 150mg per day. The side effects are as follows, severe weight loss, I have lost 3 stone, insomnia, I go to bed, doze for about an hour & I am fully awake ready to get up. Constipation is another, my doctor says its just my body rejecting the medication. Memory, impossible remembering things, everything I do has to be written down, including when I finish work. Remembering people, names, faces etc - I've lost 'friends' because I can't remember names & they think I'm being 'funny' with them. The nurse said I will be on the meds for 2 to 3 years, I could do with coming off it sooner but I am so scared because I am afraid I will have another episode. I am stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea - yes it works for me... but I don't want to end up feeling how I am now - for someone who could remember everything to how I am now is just shocking - good luck to you if you are taking it.",himbo99

I take this drug along with two other ones, Keppra and Trileptal three times a day.  Most of the time I feel tired and would like to sleep.  Also my long term memory is effected and my eyes are photosensitive because the bright sun causes them to give me blurred vision.  I guess that I will have to take the bad with the good.

Almost instantly, from that initial does of 25mg I started being able to focus and the fogginess lifted. As the dosage increased to 150mg to twice a day, I was given back all waking hours of clarity.
