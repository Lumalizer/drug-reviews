0,Dilantin,Epilepsy,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 12, 2021",1,"I was diagnosed with epilepsy in 1971. Have taken Dilantin for 50 years and have been seizure-free for the last 17. However, my doctor  is  weaning  me off the Dilantin and onto Keppra because I am starting Harvoni for Hepatitis C and Dilantin is contraindicated.  I  am quite scared that I will experience breakthrough seizures, but my doctor will not allow me to take life-saving Harvoni without starting the Keppra. :(",GroovySherrie

6,Dilantin,Epilepsy,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 15, 2019",13,"I've been on and off Dilantin now for 50 something years for clonic-tonic seizures diagnosed when I was a teen. No matter whatever new and improved potion hits the market I always end up back with Dilantin. The reason; for me it works consistently when nothing else does. And I've been on most others over the years.It can have some rough side effects and it requires care to get/keep the levels right.All AEDs have their issues and Dilantin has more than its share. For me it's simply better than anything else on the market, no matter how new.",carolinus
7,Dilantin,Epilepsy,3.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 9, 2019",13,"I started on Dilantin when I was about 11 years old, around 1981 to treat seizures in my sleep. 300 mg every night.  It stopped all seizures, I had no side effects, and it was cheap. Never had a problem unless I missed more than 2 nights. Then the manufacturer changed the capsule around 2008 or 09 and they quit working,  they claimed nothing changed but many people were complaining at the time, and the price has gotten 8x more expensive. Now I can't find prescriptions that works.",Notmyname

9,Dilantin,Epilepsy,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 20, 2017",8,"Evening,I have been on this medication since I was 12 years of age.Why do doctors or neurologists NOT tell you about Epilepsy?  About the Half Life of Phenytoin, about Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)?  Those who have Epilepsy do not necessarily know or at all ANYTHING about that cause people in general think you are WEIRD.  SICK?",Focal Epilepsy
10,Dilantin,Epilepsy,9.0,,"August 14, 2017",12,"I started dilantin in 1974.  About 25 years of taking it has given me peripheral neuropathy. No Dr in all those years told me that it might do this to me. I am changing over to Keppra  but the damage is done. My balance is off and for PAIN I take lyrica. If dilantin works for that's great, but we should be informed that neuropathy might happen.",LJWeezie
11,Dilantin,Epilepsy,3.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 24, 2016",15,"After 41+years on various meds many included this one.  Unfortunately, it must be monitored closely and depending on factors like body weight, other meds taken, caffeine intake, and more, it can be a difficult balancing act.  Dilantin toxicity has happened and is a living hell for all.  The med can be good to stop nocturnal tonic clonics if you are having those, which are life-threatening.  Do your research, make sure dilantin levels are taken periodically at trough and consider more than just the 20 max if you take a does afterward.  Make sure you have a liver profile taken periodically.  A doc may have to be reminded but it's best to have one who knows meds and does bloodwork regularly. Find a good epileptologist you get along with.",stex

Now it's apparent I have a secondary disability of Osteoporosis after seeing a endocrinologist and having a bone density test done. My doctor says it is likely due to the regular use of epileptic medicines with Dilantin being the most  likely source.",CallinMrG
13,Dilantin,Epilepsy,9.0,,"June 8, 2016",10,"After back to back tonic-clonic(grand-mal) seizures in 1989, I was put on Dilantin. With differing insurance programs, many times generic forms of it had to be used. A year back, although on 400 mg gram of phenytoin was still having problems. Since then, have been returned to Dilantin and reduction to 300mg per day. With this reduction, the blood tests are running high. However, some seizures still exist, but no massive seizures or complete blackouts are present.To handle mental recall problems, was put on strattera, years ago. The combination of Dilantin and straterra has improved my communication abilities. The original difficulties were courtesy of brain damage due to an auto accident. The brain damage created the epilepsy and aphasia.",Dr CK

21,Dilantin,Epilepsy,7.0,,"January 5, 2012",6,"I have been taking Dilantin since late 1991. Started off at 300mg nightly and was increased over time to 400mg when fits became more severe anf frequent. While pregnant with my 3rd child in 2007, dose was increased to 500mg nightly. This dose was never dropped back after pregnancy ended. In June 2011, I underwent brain surgery to have the scarring causing my fits removed. So far, it has been successful. At 22, I had 2 lumps removed from my left breast, which thankfully turned out to be non-cancerous. But after finding a very noticeable lump in my left breast this year, I had a mammogram. The nurse found 22 lumps in total in both breasts! My GP is not concerned and tells me they are just little oil sacks, but lump is not shrinking.",deb_kurikka

It has controlled my seizures pretty well until recently. I was diagnosed with COPD 2 years ago, and in that time, I have been having seizures every 3-6 months.

I experience shaking hands, anxiety, and being very klutzy and forgetful. I have been on the medication for just over nine years and the seizures have slowed, but even on the treatment I'll still experience grand mals that are significant; but not as bad as they used to be.
