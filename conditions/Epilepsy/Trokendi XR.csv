0,Trokendi XR,Epilepsy,10,,"February 18, 2020",12,"I have seizures but also suffer from severe migraines that became more and more frequent. My neurologist started me on this medication I was an also on 400mg neurontin and was previously on keppra. I’m now up to 100mg daily of the trokendi with the neurontin and my headaches are almost completely gone! I’ve suffered from migraines almost all my life! I feel them try to come once in a while when severe weather is coming or when my hormones are fluctuating but they never fully become a complete migraine. I haven’t experienced the brain fog I’ve heard about, but I do get tingly nerve sensations in my feet, hands and face occasionally. No mood swings, my mood is actually more stable. Hope this helps someone. Also, I don’t have frequent seizures so I can’t really say if it helps with that. My seizures are triggered by traumatic stress, so it’s more of a preventative.",Jamie
