0,Topamax,Epilepsy,10,,"May 20, 2021",0,"I had issues with finding words on this drug and to be honest it is a a little bizarre. At times, the drug will make you feel a little loopy especially if you haven’t eaten anything. I hadn’t noticed anything with weight loss. I eat a balanced diet, and workout quite vigorously. I started it at 244 pounds and am at 242 pounds. If you are looking for some miracle weight loss drug then it may not be for you. My neurologist even said that people come in and want it just to lose weight. I was prescribed it as I already take Lamotrigine. My neurologist said it would be a good combination. I was planning on going off of it because of forgetting the words; however, I am going to stay on it. It is either minor side effect vs seizures.",Fperkin2
1,Topamax,Epilepsy,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2021",2,"Please please explore other options. I hope no one has the experience I had. I was prescribed this for seizures and sleep issues. My first and only time taking this pill was horrifying. I could not see, think and had no ability to function. I sat in the bathtub an entire night awake without having a single thought pass through my mind. I did not know this was even possible. I was crying uncontrollably and yet I understood that was I trapped inside of my body without being able to have any thoughts. I was simply aware that I was there and nothing more. Don't try this at home kids.",Kay
2,Topamax,Epilepsy,6,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 20, 2019",19,"IT MADE ME SKINNY AND DUMB BUT WORKED TOOI have been taking Topamax for about 13 years now for my Epilepsy. It took a long time for it to work completely (near) but has helped my migraines a lot too.The side effects are horrible. I dropped to 7 stone very quickly and it took a long time for my weight to stabilise. The pins and needles in my feet come and go but can be bad at night still. But the worst is the memory. Words fail me. I can’t do simple maths in my head anymore. I don’t remember people’s names. Just terrible sometimes. If it was only migraines, I’d survive with sumatriptan. I need it for my epilepsy though. It’s good but terrible.",The supermodel drug
