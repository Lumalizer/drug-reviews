0,Lamictal,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 24, 2022",2,"Hives, dry mouth, dry eyes, vision change and dry patches of skin under my eyes. 150 mg for a few weeks. All these symptoms have been with me even a week after stopping this med.",Yuck
1,Lamictal,Epilepsy,2.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 18, 2021",2,"Lamictal caused rare horrendous side effects for me - massive appetite increase, significantly higher blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and muscle loss.",Jack
2,Lamictal,Epilepsy,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 10, 2021",2,"I won't talk about my experience of how it controlled epilepsy, because I don't know.When I was on Keppra, I was a terrible person when I was taking it alone, feeling angry and depressed all the time. After another violent seizure, I was prescribed Lamictal on top of Keppra. I tried to refuse to take it but ended up taking it anyways (along with keppra). Once I reached 100mg bd all of the Keppra side effects were gone, and I felt like a different person.But like any anti-epilipsy medicine, there are side effects and I had two:1- I couldn't sleep more than 5 hours at night, I never used an alarm to wake up (you wish to need it once you reach this level)2- Dry mouth, nostrils, and eyes, dry to the point I can't open my eyes when I wake up and I needed an eye-drop to open my eyes. My mouth was dry despite not being thirsty, my eyes and mouth literally felt like sandpaper.",Anonymous
3,Lamictal,Epilepsy,10.0,,"October 5, 2021",0,This drug has helped me massively throughout the past few years. I was taking regular monthly seizures for about 3/4 days a month in my sleep and had several ambulances called for me then when I started this drug things have reduced not stopped completely but reduced drastically.  Not had a grand mal for three years and have absence seizures but rare  no where near as much as I did.  This drug has caused very little side effects I can't even recall one to be honest and if anything it has gave me confidence to stand up for myself for some weird reason lol. Highly recommend also can drink alcohol without side effects never had a side effect from it so yeah I'd stick to this,Lamictal
4,Lamictal,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 9, 2021",5,"Lamictal did NOT work for me. I have MTS (mesial temporal sclerosis). I had smaller febrile seizures when I was a 1-2 years old. It wasn't until starting college I had a huge grandMal seizures, focals, etc. My neurologist began my on Lamictal and it did absolutely nothing for me. I had breakthrough seizures, confusion, and it was overall not a great match. If you are in the same boat I am in, I would recommend going down the Keppra route/oxcarbazepine (until this recently has caused hyponatremia).",Nic

6,Lamictal,Epilepsy,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 13, 2019",15,"Been on lamictal for about 7 years, it was prescribed to me for myoclonic seizures. My epilepsy improved a bit, but I still have seizures almost every day. When my doctor tried to take me off of it, putting me on keppra, I started having grandmals, so he immediately put it back. I haven't had a grandmal for years now, thankfully, but myoclonic seizures still happen frequently.",Kurisu

No changes with seizures in my sleep but side effects were insomnia,  constipation,  and hair loss. I had to take sleep aid to get a decent night sleep or else 2 or 3 hours was all I could  get",Noname

9,Lamictal,Epilepsy,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 30, 2018",15,"I’m 46 y/o female and started Lamictal after sudden onset of seizures.  Unknown cause.  I have Crohn’s disease and have had my entire large intestine removed along with most of my small intestines.  I’ve noticed my mood has improved, which is a welcome effect!  Rather than being a human slug, I’m able to complete some housework and...wait for it.....DO LAUNDRY!!!  The only issue I’ve had is cystic acne that got pretty bad when I was taking over 100 mg day.  I now take just 100 mg and no more acne or rash.No seizures except a few when coming out of aenesthesia after some procedures or surgery.  This has been remedied by getting premeds and IV seizure meds when having surgery.  I’m happy again and look forward to the future!!",Anonymous
10,Lamictal,Epilepsy,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 15, 2018",8,"I take 500mg a day (have 2 separate prescriptions since it's above the maximum).Taking it for the last 5 years.It's been almost a year since I've had a seizure.At first, while I was increasing the dosage it gave me extremely lucid dreams (like, wake up thinking that it was real kind of thing).After you're on it for a while, it's pretty much just life.Only bad I can think of is how irritable I get when I'm hungry and I feel crummy when my blood sugar is low. It's made me put on some weight which I hate. Can't wait to get off this stuff and have no seizures and lose weight!",Zach Ger
11,Lamictal,Epilepsy,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 6, 2018",1,"I am currently titrating up to help my  day and nocturnal seizures. I am at 50mg morning and night. So far it seems to have helped with the nocturnal but increased my seizures during the day. If you are in Scotland and its the weekend you can go to a chemist and they can supply you with a week of medication to tide you over should you run out, so you don't miss any doses. They will sort out the paperwork and inform your GP that they have given you that medication. Take a repeat slip if you have one and try to stick to a regular chemist and obviously try to remember to order.. easier said than done with multiple medications and memory problems. Your chemist can also order them and deliver if needed.",Purple-Rain-Scotland

16,Lamictal,Epilepsy,10.0,,"January 27, 2017",24,"I cannot stop singing its praises. Two years ago I had no idea what was wrong with me, I felt ""fogginess"" and tried everything- declared ""headaches"" caused by anxiety or depression, had to take a year off of school since I couldn't function; xanax helped but I didn't understand why, and about 17 other antidepressants or antianxiety medications later I was put on lamictal due to a diagnosis of BPD. Almost instantly, from that initial does of 25mg I started being able to focus and the fogginess lifted. As the dosage increased to 150mg to twice a day, I was given back all waking hours of clarity. I could focus, produce, study, think clearly, remember clearly, everything. As a result of being given power back, the depression vanished.",Anonymous
