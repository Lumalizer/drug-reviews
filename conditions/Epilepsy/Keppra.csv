0,Keppra,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 19, 2022",0,For us Keppra was not the right medicine. My son started on this medication at 6 months old and was on it till about 2.5 years old. It didn't seem to help with seizures and also seemed to cause aggression issues. Once we removed this medication his over all attitude changed for the better.I will say that while on it one thing that helped with the aggression was B6 vitamin.,jshipwash

2,Keppra,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 10, 2022",0,I took this medication during my pregnancy with my youngest son. I had almost 160 seizures during the pregnancy plus I was a horrible person to be around due to the constant irritability. It was horrible. My son was delivered early to try to get me on a better medicine. My doctor suggested we try it again after the pregnancy and it still didn't work. Horrible medicine!,Lynn
3,Keppra,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 8, 2021",0,"This 'Med'/Keppra/Brivatiracetam always been Neuro's 1st choice since diagnosed in 2008 for 'Opiate induced Epilepsy' @30 (3000mg's). Not helped 'Absent' or 'Nocturnal Seizures'! Would take any 'Med' to avoid Sleep-Wandering, biting Mouth to shreds & various injuries when awaken. Keppra = No Thanks..The SIZE of the Tab's are scary enough, increased anxiety, zombified 24/7, terrible lethargy, that KEPPRA RAGE & negative feelings as others have described.. (Tegretol, Clobezam + Zebinix are helping more tbh)The gut feeling with others experiences on this 'Med' confirms suspicions. Bless all..",Nicky Cotton
4,Keppra,Epilepsy,5.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 10, 2021",0,"I was prescribed this drug after my first episode, didn't have the second seizure until three years later after missing a couple of doses. So I assume it worked well and I didn't suffer any physical side effects as my doctor kept monitoring the drug level through blood tests until she found the right amount.HOWEVER, this drug literally made me a very horrible person, a bad guy, someone that I remember and I feel disgusted by, I feel embarrassed. I ruined some relationships and career opportunities. I was put into SSRIs and they didn't help but made things worse. I was in a rage all the time, I call it KepprageAfter another violent seizure, I was prescribed Lamictal which counterbalanced Keppra's psychological side effect",Anonymous
5,Keppra,Epilepsy,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 8, 2021",0,"Keppra has been the only thing that controls my seizures. It is dangerous at higher doses. It gave me suicidal fantasies and a bi polar like personality. When I lowered the dose I feel more stable with a joy for life, but I am so fatigue 24/7. After taking it 20 years my memory is shot and I am scared I am going to get early onset dementia. However, an Epileptic has to think about surviving each day without having a seizure in a dangerous circumstance that could kill or seriously injure themselves and others. So although Keppra is not perfect by any means and it will take a lot of experimentation for the right dose, it gave me the best chance at a normal life, seizure free.",A NAME

First month was a bit rough as I felt disoriented and fatigued. Had a bit of a hiccup when my NOT so usual doctor switched me to immediate release generic. That was terrible!  Suicide ideation, anger, and hostility. Life was really awful within 24 hours on that crap!  Even got in trouble with the law by day two!  Knowing that wasn’t me, I went back to my regular and much loved doctor. Although not covered under my HMO, I needed my doctor and Keppra XR Brand.

13,Keppra,Epilepsy,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 10, 2020",3,"I have sadly had a love/dislike relationship with Keppra. Almost right away after starting it after being diagnosed with simple partial seizure epilepsy, almost all symptoms I had been dealing with were gone. Within a week it was amazing to have a day without constant headaches, feeling dizzy, seeing flashes of lights, etc.Starting Keppra, it was discussed between my doctor and I and my spouse that it has a common side effect of causing what she referred to as ""Keppra Rage"". Fortunately for me, I did not experience that. Unfortunately, it did cause me crippling anxiety to the point I couldn't sleep with a blanket, and would commonly feel the urge to run outside because it felt like what I would guess a panic attack would feel like. Without that one side effect, Keppra would be my best friend. I would encourage people to try it if offered however.",Kyler532

16,Keppra,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 26, 2020",37,"When first put on keppra, things seemed to be fine. But over time, when I had my annual neuro appointment and I’d tell them of any seizures I’d had that year, they’d up the keppra dosage. And the more keppra I took, the more seizures I had. I didn’t realize that till later. At one point I was on 4000mg (?too much?) of the XR version daily. That’s when I figured that the keppra was the culprit to more frequent seizures. And the after effects of a seizure while on that dosage lasted for days. They were major depression, headache and minor after shocks like another seizure was going to happen. In the past three years I’m working my way slowly off this drug. Now no longer on the XR version, just regular immediate release pills. On 500mg a day. I have less seizures. And if I do, I recover from them within an hour or so. One more thing. On the Keppa XR, keppra rage was no joke. I’d be fine. The out of the blue, just all hateful and mad for no reason.

It’s like always being at your worst and there are days you question your own sanity or the point of carrying on. I am trying to convince my neurologists to find an alternative to this awful tablet as I’m now at the point where I have panic attacks even leaving my bedroom, my vision is constantly blurred and flickering and it feels like I have a CONSTANT aura as I get pre seizure.

Here were my side effects- irritability, paranoia, anxiety, nausea, loss of appetite, numbness and tingling in my arms and legs, it would make my aura seizures come more often than they normally would without medication, felt dizzy and light headed, which would worsen during an aura seizure.  Made me get aura seizures when I was still asleep and it would wake me up! Made me feel suicidal also.  I took the medication for about six months and have had more than enough of it. Was  tired each day I could barely get up to do normal things, even to cook. I decided to wean off myself,  I decreased dose to half a tablet in morning, hoping it would stop at the very least my aura seizures in my sleep, but it didn’t help. I then thought after a few months- enough is enough. After taking half a tablet in morning for few months I stopped taking it completely. Never felt better.

We went through all the test and they all came back normal except for my EEG. it came back abnormal. I was immediately put on keppra and hated every second of it. I started off with 500mg 2x a day. After the first dose I was hallucinating and very confused. The four hour mark was the worst. I was super loopy and couldn't focus for nothing. the medicine caused me to have mood swings and go into a deep depression. My advice if you have any sort of mental illness DON'T TAKE IT.
