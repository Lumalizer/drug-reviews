0,Tegretol,Epilepsy,3,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 17, 2021",0,"In the early 80's my five year old daughter was being treated by a top children's neurologist for focal seizures which she started having after a severe, undiagnosed life threatening illness at 4 months. She was changed from dilantin to tegretol by this doctor who I had great respect for when I told him the side effects from this drug were harming my child. She couldn't remember anything, she acted dazed and confused, she scared me concerning her development while taking tegretol. We fought over changing the drug which he said was new and better than dilantin. I said I don't care she doesn't act like this on dilantin and I'm not leaving your office until you change it. So now I read these side effects and I was right. I still love that doctor but I knew my child too... And also My other kid reacted better to Rondec syrup for bronchitis than that Albuterol new drug they changed her to, it was absolutely clear to me that while new drugs are wonderful and I am grateful for them, new needs monitoring",Grannyfae
1,Tegretol,Epilepsy,3,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 11, 2020",11,"I was on Tegretol from the mid late 80’s till 2016. It helped in the beginning. But as I got older, add on drugs were needed. Then in 2014, I could not stop eating. I was always hungry, yet loosing weight. I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. And I was put on medication for that. In 2016, my doc took me off tegretol and replaced it with lamictal. Once off the tegretol, my thyroid started to function normally. And medication for my thyroid was no longer needed. It’s not a bad drug. But your body changes over time. Another negative about the drug was how frequently I had to urinate. I would have to go at least 15 if not more times a day. Towards its discontinuation, I was on  1200mg of it daily.",Scott
2,Tegretol,Epilepsy,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 25, 2019",12,"Tegretolol is the only medicine that stops my tonic clonic seizures. I've been on it over a year, taking 1,000 mgs a day. The first month I had memory problems and drowsiness but that went away fast. The biggest side effect I had that never went away is severe depression caused by it. My depression is gone thanks to Lexapro 20 mg a day. I highly recommend Tegretol for tonic clonics seizures due to Epilepsy.",Mnyc
3,Tegretol,Epilepsy,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 16, 2019",9,I'm 18. I had random contractions and twists in my arm since when I was 10. It lasted for only about 0.005 secs. And then gradually increase. Now I have attacks that last for hours (the longest one lasted 9 hrs).I used to consult ortho docs since I did not not know what it was. They kept telling me I had muscle cramps. Because I do martial arts I believed it. But at last I consulted a nuero when once I had a bad attack and the ortho doc was on leave. He diagnosed me with exercise induced paroxysmal dystonia. He prescribed tegretol and I started on a low dose. It didn't seem to help me. I gradually increased its dose and now I don't get those attacks! I have no family history of disorders but one cousin with epilepsy.,Ash

6,Tegretol,Epilepsy,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2017",11,"MAKE SURE YOUR DOCTOR  TITRATES THE DRUG AND DOES NOT START YOU  ON A HIGH DOSE. The 1 grade should be for my Dr. Not the medication. I am a female about 105lbs. My Dr. started me on 800mg without titration for possible seizures. After 2 days I was so sick and dizzy and my head / ears werewas buzzing like crazy.  I had non stop vomiting, ringing in my ears and severe  indescribable dizziness. I ended up going to the ER.  I am  sticking to lamictal and found a new Doctor.",Dawn789
7,Tegretol,Epilepsy,3,,"July 17, 2016",7,"The XR seams better than the traditional form used in the 80s that resulted in sodium depletion.  This form causes twitching, sporadic and  rapidly occurring tremors that make sleeping difficult, increased urination frequency, some minor dizziness at first, and possibly elevated skin sensitivity to sunlight.",stex

I was put on carbamazepine for possible epilepsy and it didn't seem to do anything - but the doctors said to just keep trying. However, it continued to worsen, making my focus dip considerably, and causing my hearing to change! (I'm a musician, I could tell - it dropped a semitone down.) Was very annoying.",applesauce7

Somethings I have noticed over the years although I don't have any medical evidence to back this up only self observation are. Massive increase in body hair. Not on the head but over the rest of the body. Most of my nails split down the centre of the nail. As for controlling my epilepsy can not say they really did, prior to my operation, at first all was hokey dorey, then the body seemed to get used the medication and as a result the dose increased. Today 24 years after the operation I remain on 1200mg a day. Seizure free, thanks to the opp, although i do remain on the tablets.",Twistyfil

20,Tegretol,Epilepsy,9,,"March 27, 2012",38,"Have had complex partial seizure disorder for over 40 years.  My main medicine that held me for years was Phenobarbital.  When I started having breakthrough seizures, Tegretol was the secondary medicine that has held me okay for the past 4 years.  I tried Tegretol XR first but for me, I felt very tired, some dizziness, poor memory, and very bland.  When the Dr switched me to regular Tegretol, it was totally opposite!  I felt alive again, memory sharp, out riding horses, happy as a lark and felt like my good old self.  People should know there are many different medicines for epilepsy these days and also that there is a Tegretol XR (long-acting).",Seattlechic
21,Tegretol,Epilepsy,10,,"December 31, 2010",36,"I am 39 years old now, and have been on Tegretol since I was 20.  I have not had a seizure for 19  years.  Then, this past weekend, I went on a trip and did not take my Tegretol for 3 out of the 4 days I was there.  The next day, I had a grandmal seizure and the ambulance came.  I attribute it to becoming complacent and it really bit me, but I will not make this mistake of being lazy and not taking it again.  I was on 200 mg for the last 3 years without a problem, but will increase it to 400 mg just in case.  Tegretol really does work wonders and I hope to be seizure free the rest of my life, if I can faithfully stay on this medicine.",Anonymous2010

I have been lucky as I did not have a seizure, but my word I have been so poorly, depressed, loss of appetite, and body tingles, from my lips to my toes. I never realized how important it is to take my pills till now. I will never make that mistake again, the 1st day I started them again, I was a ball of tears, very sad and tired, but a day later I'm back to my old happy self. I'll never forget them again.",sarah j 1977

I was taking 600mg of Tegretol for the last week and I developed a awful red rash and itching all over. My doctor has changed me to dilantin today and I hope I do better on that.
