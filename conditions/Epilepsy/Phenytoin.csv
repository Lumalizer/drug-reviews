0,Phenytoin,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 23, 2021",1,Found I was allergic to phenytoin.  On the 7th day broke out in itchy rash from head to toe.  It only took a few hours for the spreading of rash to cover my entire body.  I'm miserable.  Dr. had me stop cold turkey.  I'm so disappointed.  I had high hopes for this drug.  I cried for hours yesterday.  The rash is horrible.  This drug also caused horrible gas.  Was having to take Gas-X along with it.,Mary
1,Phenytoin,Epilepsy,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 12, 2021",1,"Dilantin (phenytoin):I was diagnosed with epilepsy in 1971. Have taken Dilantin for 50 years and have been seizure-free for the last 17. However, my doctor  is  weaning  me off the Dilantin and onto Keppra because I am starting Harvoni for Hepatitis C and Dilantin is contraindicated.  I  am quite scared that I will experience breakthrough seizures, but my doctor will not allow me to take life-saving Harvoni without starting the Keppra. :(",GroovySherrie

No matter whatever new and improved potion hits the market I always end up back with Dilantin. The reason; for me it works consistently when nothing else does. And I've been on most others over the years.It can have some rough side effects and it requires care to get/keep the levels right.All AEDs have their issues and Dilantin has more than its share. For me it's simply better than anything else on the market, no matter how new.",carolinus
8,Phenytoin,Epilepsy,3.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 9, 2019",13,"Dilantin (phenytoin):I started on Dilantin when I was about 11 years old, around 1981 to treat seizures in my sleep. 300 mg every night.  It stopped all seizures, I had no side effects, and it was cheap. Never had a problem unless I missed more than 2 nights. Then the manufacturer changed the capsule around 2008 or 09 and they quit working,  they claimed nothing changed but many people were complaining at the time, and the price has gotten 8x more expensive.

No Dr in all those years told me that it might do this to me. I am changing over to Keppra  but the damage is done. My balance is off and for PAIN I take lyrica.

12,Phenytoin,Epilepsy,3.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 24, 2016",15,"Dilantin (phenytoin):After 41+years on various meds many included this one.  Unfortunately, it must be monitored closely and depending on factors like body weight, other meds taken, caffeine intake, and more, it can be a difficult balancing act.  Dilantin toxicity has happened and is a living hell for all.  The med can be good to stop nocturnal tonic clonics if you are having those, which are life-threatening.  Do your research, make sure dilantin levels are taken periodically at trough and consider more than just the 20 max if you take a does afterward.  Make sure you have a liver profile taken periodically.  A doc may have to be reminded but it's best to have one who knows meds and does bloodwork regularly. Find a good epileptologist you get along with.",stex

14,Phenytoin,Epilepsy,9.0,,"June 8, 2016",10,"Dilantin (phenytoin):After back to back tonic-clonic(grand-mal) seizures in 1989, I was put on Dilantin. With differing insurance programs, many times generic forms of it had to be used. A year back, although on 400 mg gram of phenytoin was still having problems. Since then, have been returned to Dilantin and reduction to 300mg per day. With this reduction, the blood tests are running high. However, some seizures still exist, but no massive seizures or complete blackouts are present.To handle mental recall problems, was put on strattera, years ago. The combination of Dilantin and straterra has improved my communication abilities. The original difficulties were courtesy of brain damage due to an auto accident. The brain damage created the epilepsy and aphasia.",Dr CK

This dose was never dropped back after pregnancy ended. In June 2011, I underwent brain surgery to have the scarring causing my fits removed. So far, it has been successful. At 22, I had 2 lumps removed from my left breast, which thankfully turned out to be non-cancerous. But after finding a very noticeable lump in my left breast this year, I had a mammogram.
