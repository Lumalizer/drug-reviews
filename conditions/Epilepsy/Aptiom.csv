0,Aptiom,Epilepsy,2,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 25, 2021",0,My experience with Aptiom has not been good. For one thing it does not control my seizures. I would say maybe worse. I am on 400 mg a day. I know this is a low dose but if I take more it makes me angry and nuts. A hour after I take it I change personality. I go way back into my memory and of course not the good memories. It is really hard to function when this happens. My anxiety is also worse on this.  I was told that a person who suffers from mental illness like anxiety and depression and others should be leary of taking Aptiom. I don't know if this is true but for what it does to me I wonder. Hopefully my doctor can find another anticonvulsant that works. I am running out of ones to try. My next step after all my options are up is to go to natural remedies.,Unhappy
1,Aptiom,Epilepsy,7,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 7, 2021",0,"I was started on this because nothing else would work, and yes there are side effects I have to deal with. I was always weak in the stomach but now when my stomach trembles I projectile vomit. So being dizzy and having my stomach trembling, scare me. The migraines come about 2 times a month and they are debilitating, to say the least. I'm not sure which is worse the seizures or the side effects.  I take 400 mg twice a day, to keep my levels steady, but I've begun to feel, uneasy in my emotions as well I cry a lot, or get angry for no reason.  Not sure if I'll continue on this.....Also, I had to fight my insurance to pay for it, or it would cost me $2000.00 a month who can afford that. Now I pay $200, for three month supply.",Grey lady
2,Aptiom,Epilepsy,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 26, 2021",5,"It's been amazing for me.  I was having very frequent focal seizures for about four years. I self-diagnosed the seizures as anxiety (thanks to Dr Google) and never visited a doctor for help. Then, I had a tonic-clonic seizure and ended up hospitalized. After a bunch of tests, my Neurophysiologist diagnosed my epilepsy and put me on 400 mg of Aptiom per day. I haven't had a single seizure (focal or tonic-clonic) since -- it's been about 4 months. Best of all, I have zero side effects. Thus far, it's been miracle drug from me.",Joseph Schmoo
3,Aptiom,Epilepsy,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 11, 2021",9,"At first at first I thought this medication was working, but slowly but surely I realized I was having really extremely bad panic attacks out of nowhere, then for the first time ever I had humongous seizures that were exactly like grand mal seizures but I was awake and I couldn't control my seizure. I had at least 20 back to back that I've never had before. I have extreme trembles where I feel them inside my body. It's absolutely insane. My panic attacks are continuous and now I panic that I'm going to have a panic attack. I'm trying to stop this medicine but it's like I'm having some type of withdrawal... Maybe. I pray that this goes away. This will be my 3rd day off of it and I can not stop trembling.",FeelCamile
4,Aptiom,Epilepsy,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 21, 2020",6,"I have been on Dilantin for nearly 15 years. Currently been seizure free for 10. My neurologist put me on Aptiom as he planned to take me off medication all together. It was fine until I had to double the dosage. The headaches are extreme. There is some random numbness in my extremities. I also have random tremors. The side effects have been scarier than the seizures. Came off of it for weeks and still have the side effects. I think this med is great in small dosage, but thatâ€™s it.",Anonymous
5,Aptiom,Epilepsy,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 29, 2019",4,"This has been the most effective medicine of all the seizure medications I have tried, which has been a lot. I agree that the medicine is extremely expensive, which is a major downside to using it. Still, if it helps, then it helps.",Winnie the Pooh

7,Aptiom,Epilepsy,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 10, 2019",5,The seizure control is great. One big problem with this drug is that it can cause hypothyroidism. My son was hypothyroid before going on this medication and now it has dropped his levels drastically even when he is on thyroid medication. If this doesn't improve with more thyroid medication he will have to stop the Aptiom. I hope this doesn't happen because its the only one he can take.,Dara
8,Aptiom,Epilepsy,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 14, 2019",5,Well my son's Aptiom dose was upped to 400 mg and now the side effects have started - a real dry cough and a bit of trouble breathing. I hope in the next couple days this improves otherwise he will have to come off of it. He is supposed to increase it to 600 mg in a couple of days which I will be leary to do in case the breathing gets worse.  As in my other review I mentioned my son has 22q11 ( deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22) which unfortunately makes him very sensitive to medications. I really hope this one works although the cost is super expensive.,Dara
9,Aptiom,Epilepsy,8,,"November 14, 2018",5,Seizure control ok so far.  Mild skin rash from 1200mg once a day.  Will ask doctor about either reducing dosage or taking 600mg twice a day.,Alex
