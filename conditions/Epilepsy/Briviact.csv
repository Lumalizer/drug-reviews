0,Briviact,Epilepsy,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 27, 2022",0,"I was diagnosed later in life at the age of 57 I had my second seizure and was placed on Levetiraceram, but after 4 years I started to get focal seizures on a weekly basis but didn’t lose consciousness just lost my vision or hallucinated. Being moved on to Briviact stop the FS but fatigue has been a problem now for over 7 months, but that’s better than getting the FS’s.The only other problem in weight gain I put on about 10-12lbs and have to watch what I eat now, so much for being skinny and fit and loved playing ice hockey. Not anymore.",Poppi
1,Briviact,Epilepsy,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 1, 2022",0,"So far, Briviact has been a huge help. I take it daily with Xcopri. I am going on several weeks without a seizure since the doctor increased the dose on December 14. The last seizure was the night before the increase. I was worried about side effects, but it hasn't caused any side effects for me yet. I am on the maximum dose. Keppra made me extremely irritable, but thankfully Briviact hasn't done that.",Lynn
2,Briviact,Epilepsy,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 6, 2021",1,"Briviact is my 13th med. Keppra caused more side effects. Briviact is finally working. I'm going past 25 weeks without a T/C. I had laser ablation on my front temporal lobe & it didn't work. I do feel more lethargic & I'm hoping my skin problems aren't coming back but I'm taking 100mg 2x's a day so maybe I can take less but I'm scared to change anything. I do believe in gut health. I've had mono at age 1 & my naturopathic was the only one to test my thyroid, hormones, cortisol levels correctly. She told me that I have active EBV (epstein barr virus) & it's cousin virus called HHV-6 which actually causes seizures because it attacks the nervous system so with her treatment, I've been able to calm down the virus & I've been able to get off both of my high blood pressure meds. I almost had to get on a 3rd HBP when I was on (brand name) Keppra XR at 1500mg a day. I had low sodium levels as well. I need more time to know how this will affect my health over time & I could follow a keto but no",Mary
3,Briviact,Epilepsy,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 24, 2021",0,"I am a 45 year old man that, for some strange reason, came down with epilepsy about ten years ago. I have mainly temporal lobe epilepsy but have had a few generalize. I am a band teacher that was doing way too much and told everyone yes for everything so I think that it was stress and lack of sleep that made this start. I have been on many different meds but started Briviact along with Trileptal a few years back. My doctor told me that I was intractable and began to do some testing to begin to see if I was a candidate for surgery. I was very scared and did not want that portion of my brain messed with. I told him let's try some other meds and this this when Briviact came in. After not driving a vehicle for two years the combination of breviact and trileptal worked. We are not even talking surgery anymore. I will say that I do experience anxiety, sleepiness, double vision (occasionally)irritability (this is a big one) numbness and an uneasy feeling.",Drum Guy
4,Briviact,Epilepsy,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 19, 2021",2,"Briviact which has bad side effects, has messed up my 35 yrs old son. He's not the person he was 3 yrs ago. I told Dr I wanted his meds changed. Dr. stopped this, then put him on Keppra which has the same side effects. After a week I told Dr to put him back on Depakene (Valproic Acid) which is generic brand. He had took this years ago with no side effects. I had been telling the Dr that my son was having doing weird stuff. He said you have to deal with it.....Really?? He acted like he didn't even care? Its been 3 weeks he is still not himself...Is anybody else having this problem. This is a night mare for me & my husband.",Sally Long
5,Briviact,Epilepsy,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 4, 2021",8,"Disabled USMC Veteran with traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, and intractable epilepsy. Briviact had given me 103 days without seizures. No medicine in 20 years has been able to keep me from having a single seizure for this long. Keppra was the last medicine I was on at 3000mg per day and it was horrific. I was a nightmare to my family, my personality was robbed from me on that medicine and it caused awful side effects. I was put ion Briviact 100mg 2X per day after two ER trips within five days of one another for cluster seizure events. I’ve never felt this good on an anticonvulsant and I’ve tried MANY in 2 decades. My personality, appetite, and ability to think clearly have returned. I’m able to live again without fear of dropping multiple times a week as I was having 2 l-4 seizures per week previously. 10/10 would recommend giving this a try.",Anonymous
6,Briviact,Epilepsy,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 4, 2021",5,"I tried briviact for 40 days as an alternative to keppra. Keppra controlled my seizures for the past 2.5 years, but the side effects were disrupting my relationships and career. Briviact seemed tolerable at first, and, it almost seemed like I had more energy. I began to feel emotions that were hidden under the irritability common with keppra. But, after about 30 days, my anxiety level spiked. I could not eat or sleep and lost 10 pounds. It felt like I was on some crazy upper. Unfortunately, I had to stop abruptly and return to keppra. Fortunately, the transition back to keppra only took 2 days. Now, I'm my gloomy self again. I hope you have better luck.",Jimbo
7,Briviact,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 14, 2021",3,Briviact seems to prevent my seizures but makes me sort feel so negative about life.  It's more or less a new version of Keppra regardless of what the hype is from big pharma.  Essentially it seems to influence the same srv2 protein and they do not understand how it prevents seizures nor changes your mood so brace for condescending conversations with your doctors who likely won't understand why you don't want to take a medicine that might be helping your epilepsy.  I left my last MD because she wanted me to stay on Keppra now I'm with this new doctor who apparently put me on a nearly identical med and gives me grief for not wanting to be on a medicine that makes me feel apathetic about living.,Rasta Jon
8,Briviact,Epilepsy,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 9, 2021",3,"I have been on brivact for nearly 3 and half years, alongside vimpat. These two together so far have worked well for me in relation to side effects, and seizure control. I continue to have seizures but my mood is much better, I’m less angry, emotional and aggressive. However, since starting brivact I suffered from severe rash on my legs, feet, hands and arm. It toned down once my body started to adjust to the medication change. I am currently having my dosage increased and the rash once again has flared up. The neurologist had discussed with me potentially changing from tablet form to liquid form, as I may be allergic to the coating of the medication. I also have very blurry vision, memory loss, sometimes confusion and other side effects, but overall it has been the best one far as I have tried approx 10 different types of epilepsy medication that either have changed  my personality or given me  serious side effects .",Ned
9,Briviact,Epilepsy,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 27, 2021",18,"BRIVIACT is a strong, quick onset medication. Within a half-hour after my first dose, I could feel its effects, which were nothing like other AEDs I have tried that make me just a little tired. I’m an easy-going person, so imagine my surprise when, shortly after starting BRIVIACT, I became irritable and overly talkative about situations that normally wouldn’t faze me. A few days into therapy, people expressed concern about how I was being affected. An uncomfortable conversation led me to consult my doctor about mood changes, a new need for naps, and a blister that was forming on the inside of my mouth. Upon receiving more medical advice, I ceased taking BRIVIACT immediately. Withdrawing from BRIVIACT was a long, miserable process. At times, I found myself unusually emotional and on the verge of tears. Besides, I had a headache, tinnitus, achy legs, and my feet felt like they were on fire. Feeling out of sorts, I sleep a lot and tried to recover from an alarming experience.",Anonymous
10,Briviact,Epilepsy,1.0,,"August 23, 2020",16,"Briviact is horrible I side effects of high levels of irritation, moody, angry. This medicine is causing kidney issues. I am going to restroom more than I have in my life. It’s causing inflammation. I am only 39 so I am able to tolerate. I heard it’s a new medicine and my doctor experimented with me. I feel terrible on this med. ",Tim
11,Briviact,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 17, 2020",14,I have only been on this Briviact 3 days. My ears are ringing so loudly I can't hear anything else. My head just feels like it will implode because of the ringing. I want to crush anything that makes a noise with my bare hands.,Master TKD
12,Briviact,Epilepsy,1.0,,"August 6, 2020",23,"This medication Briviact broke me mentally... I was given it as a newer better option than what I had been on and was told it did not have mood disorders like keppra did I thought great! Less meds! I was phased to a dose of 75mg twice daily over a course of a month, because I am medication resistant (having tried over 10 different types in 10 years). Everything was great until I was on my normal dose (75mg X2)for a week. Then one day snapped. I was crying over everything, angry, tired, suicidal thoughts flooded my head constantly. Panic attacks that got to the point where I collapsed. It feels like my brain is in constant self destruct mode. I had to contact my drs emergency line to know how to stop this medication right away.It has been over a month since stopping. I still don't feel like myself. I still have horrible panic attacks and emotional breakdowns and crazy thoughts. I am working closely with my doctors to get things back to ""normal"" now.",Rp303
13,Briviact,Epilepsy,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 13, 2020",16,"I’ve read about the typical side effects of Briviact. The only effects I seem to have are tiredness/sleepiness during the day and mood swings. For me, the tiredness can be overcome by staying active. Concerning the mood changes....it’s a little unpredictable and can be bad. However, overall Briviact has helped stop my seizures and I like it.",Better?

15,Briviact,Epilepsy,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 12, 2020",5,I took Keppra. That along with other meds controlled 10 seizures a day for 2 years. Now I'm on 4 seizure meds and facing brain surgery if the seizures don't stop. I just started taking Briviact and am hopeful to be seizure free for years again. So far so good but there have already been mood swings. It has only been almost a week.,Joann
16,Briviact,Epilepsy,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 12, 2020",7,I've been taken this med since March of 2019 and i get really irritated easily and itchy skin feeling aggressive sometimes but I guess it's working. I take 3 different types of meds for my seizures though. Thank you,Sucidesixx
17,Briviact,Epilepsy,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 6, 2020",15,"This medicine  Briviact has messed my life. I am super irritated, angry, and in depression all the time, crying for no reason and not to mention the skin itching problems that has started and liver problems. I have turned into a negative person, a monster with this medication. I never knew what depression was is in my life until I started Briviact.I switched to it only because I wasn't getting my periods with sodium divalproex , my seizures were always in control with divalproex.  Never had depression and was always in good mood . But this medicine has ruined my life since 2018. I have kept on it because I am in a changing career phase and can't switch to new medicine , but as soon as I am settled with my new job, I am stopping this med. How did it get approved even with the side effect of ""irritability"" and depression on the bottle? Most medicines say that but don't necessarily cause it. I regret why did I switch.",Anonymous
18,Briviact,Epilepsy,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 8, 2020",40,"I have read all of the review and have epilepsy myself since  the age of 2 years old and I am now at age 50. I have had some bad seizeures and have been revived 7 times and have been in studies, and have taken every prescription known to man kind. It seems like people are forgetting one thing - every med, that will stop or partly stop a seizers is a good med, and will improve the quality of our life, even with bad side effects or no side effects it is a good medication. There is no cause or cures for epilepsy even with surgery it will come back at some time in your life trust me. It will, no matter what Dr's say, thats the cold hard truth","charlie,"
19,Briviact,Epilepsy,6.0,,"December 31, 2019",21,"I first started keppra after having a status event that caused me to be placed in a medical induced coma to stop the seizures.   Once I started keppra it worked immediately and stopped all seizure activity.   However, after being on it for few months the rage and hostility started and wrecked havoc on my family.  So, my doctor  had me try briviact which again has worked to control the tonic clonic seizures.   However,  instead of hostility, rage and total apathy I have begun to experiment extreme sadness/depression I just feel really flat and nothing excites meBut, because it controls the tonic clonic seizures- free 35 month now, I will stay with briviact unless sadness etc becomes intolerable Overall 6",Susie
20,Briviact,Epilepsy,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 3, 2019",12,"I started this medicine November of 2017. My mood swings are absolutely terrible. I'm always irritated. I feel like the medicine makes it hard for me to focus. I was put on this medicine after having a third brain surgery. I still had seizures for about a year afterwards, then they stopped. I was seizure free from Sept 2018 up until a few weeks ago. I'm now being taken off. My consensus: The drug may be good for some people. However, with people who have medically intractable epilepsy and have tried over 5 drugs such as myself, studies show that there is less than a 1% chance that any other medicines will work either. It was worth a try I suppose, though!",Moo

24,Briviact,Epilepsy,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 21, 2019",23,I've been on a number of anti-epileptic medications over the past 15 years. Keppra gave me severe mood swings. Topamax gave me awful brain fog. Depakote didn't control my seizures and gave my son birth defects. My neurologist recently increased my Lamictal dosage because of a seizure event. That on it's own wasn't sufficient so we added Briviact. I haven't noticed any negative side effects. My seizures seem to be controlled. My tremors have completely stopped (which hasn't happened on ANY med in the past). I'm thrilled. I cannot afford this out of pocket. Medical Assistance through the state pays for it after the doctor proves it is necessary.,Patient X

I have the VNS on the lowest setting and had a TL Resection Brain Surgery (2015) both could not stop the seizures... The medication Briviact is very strong but it's the only things that worked.
