0,Rituximab,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,10.0,,"November 17, 2015",21,"I was diagnosed with CLL in 2009.  My WBC (White Blood Cell Count) when diagnosed was 11k.  By 2013 my WBC was 50k.  In 2015 my rate of increase jumped and a CAT scan confirmed that deeper lymph nodes had grown 50% in size so my oncologist wanted to start chemo right away.  I had no other symptoms associated with the CLL other than increasing WBC.In October, I started treatment with a ""cocktail"" of Rituximab and Bendamustine.  My WBC at the start of treatment was 120k.   At the end of the first month (prior to my second chemo session) my blood tests came back with totally normal numbers!  My WBC was 7k! It was as if I did not have CLL.  My blood was clean!  Few side effects (constipation/heart-burn) & about a 20% reduction in energy.",Steve K
1,Rituximab,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,10.0,,"August 22, 2014",14,"This has been an AMAZING medicine for me.  I've taken it alone (after pre-administration medicines; Pepcid & Solumedrol (steroid)) for several series (of 4 infusions each) the last 3-4 years.  It has put me back into remission every time, so far, especially knocking the WBC down into normal range from as high as 214k.  No major side-effects, either.  I can't sleep the night after my infusion (not tired, and too ""hyped up""); also I coughed a lot last time, but they slowed the drip down, and I was fine.",GEEBREE
2,Rituximab,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 14, 2014",15,"Finished my first round of Rituxan for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. Premeds- Tylenol, Zurtec and Ativan. About 5 minutes after they started the infusion, I experienced heaviness on my chest, chills, back pain and vomiting. It was managed very quickly with steroids and Benadryl.  About an hour later, it felt like a bowling ball was sitting on my chest. The nurse came rapidly to the rescue with Benadryl and Ativan. After that, I woke up when it was all over. I slept pretty much all day and night. Feeling flu like symptoms and very thirsty. Experienced night sweats and had to change my pyjamas in the middle of the night. The next day, I had flu like symptoms without a fever.   Make sure you drink a lot of water to flush your system.",Beach_Bum
3,Rituximab,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 2, 2013",84,"Rituxan (rituximab):I was diagnosed with CLL 10/2005. I began Rituxan 5/2012 once the lymph nodes began to enlarge and my counts were doubling.  Initially I was infused once per week for a month;  I have continued with this infusion but moved to a monthly visit. It is now July/2013 and my numbers have dropped significantly and my doctor has moved to a maintenance program....infusion every other month.   I have never had any side effects from the infusions and doctor is pleased that I've not required chemotherapy medicines added to get same results.  Prior to each infusion, I take two 25mg Benadryl and a Tylenol. Perhaps these medicines beforehand have aided me. I have no complaints!","Judi in Bon Air, Va."
4,Rituximab,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 2, 2013",43,"Rituxan (rituximab):I have gone through three rounds of Rituxan for Auto-Immune Hemolytic Anemia triggered by early stage Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.Each time I have had initial reactions with the first dose.  My throat and ears get itchy and my throat starts to swell.  They give me IV Benadryl and have administered Decadron, slowed down the infusion and I have done okay.It is very gradual improvement in my hemoglobin.  So slow that I'm not sure it is working but my doctors believe it is.  The only alternative is prednisone which makes me completely hyper and unable to sleep. Rituxan is the better alternative.  Unfortunately it is not stopping my AIHA just keeping my hemoglobin up.  It is extremely expensive though. ",Sydmave
5,Rituximab,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,,,"June 17, 2011",26,"My husband had been treated with rituximab for CLL.  He has had some scary reactions while receiving the infusion like uncontrollable shaking and the last time his blood pressure dropped dangerously low as well. He was taken off and given IVs to bring his blood pressure up, sent home and the next morning he completed the infusion and then his chemotherapy.  This time he also experienced dizziness.  His condition is deteriorating in other ways such as severe weight loss.  I read the severe side effects of this drug for the first time today and see him experiencing almost all of them.  I think we will try to find an alternative.  Scary for people with these reactions.",Anonymous
