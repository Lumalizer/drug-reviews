0,Rituxan,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 2, 2013",84,"I was diagnosed with CLL 10/2005. I began Rituxan 5/2012 once the lymph nodes began to enlarge and my counts were doubling.  Initially I was infused once per week for a month;  I have continued with this infusion but moved to a monthly visit. It is now July/2013 and my numbers have dropped significantly and my doctor has moved to a maintenance program....infusion every other month.   I have never had any side effects from the infusions and doctor is pleased that I've not required chemotherapy medicines added to get same results.  Prior to each infusion, I take two 25mg Benadryl and a Tylenol. Perhaps these medicines beforehand have aided me. I have no complaints!","Judi in Bon Air, Va."
1,Rituxan,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,8,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 2, 2013",43,"I have gone through three rounds of Rituxan for Auto-Immune Hemolytic Anemia triggered by early stage Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.Each time I have had initial reactions with the first dose.  My throat and ears get itchy and my throat starts to swell.  They give me IV Benadryl and have administered Decadron, slowed down the infusion and I have done okay.It is very gradual improvement in my hemoglobin.  So slow that I'm not sure it is working but my doctors believe it is.  The only alternative is prednisone which makes me completely hyper and unable to sleep. Rituxan is the better alternative.  Unfortunately it is not stopping my AIHA just keeping my hemoglobin up.  It is extremely expensive though. ",Sydmave
