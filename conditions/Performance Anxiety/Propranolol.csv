Overachiever, perfectionist, always got through but terrible anxiety and some panic attacks public speaking somehow got through it but would haunt me for weeks and months ahead of time .Had to do an event for 50 people for an hour presentation. Try different doses to make sure it works for you but for me the best dose is 10mg 2 hours before, then  10 mg 1 hour before zero fight or flight and 10/10 great feedback said it looked easy.",Experience101
1,Propranolol,Performance Anxiety,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 10, 2022",2,"Like most others have commented, propranolol has saved me. When public speaking, I'd shake, sweat, feel weak, have tunnel vision, and borderline pass out. I'd also feel sick days/weeks before the presentation. I even felt sick getting called on in class or having to introduce myself. I dropped so many classes throughout college due to presentation requirements and knew I would have to face them at some point. I read about beta-blockers (propranolol specifically) and got a prescription (which wasn't hard to do). When taking them for my first presentation, it was a world of difference. Literally, all of my symptoms had gone away and I could actually speak coherently without these anxious feelings shutting down my body. I tell everyone about this who deals with this struggle.  I usually take 20 mg about 1.5 hours before and another 10 mg about 45 mins before a presentation/scenario where I'll have to speak.",Anonymous

I am a young professional and throughout my life have been confident at giving speeches. I had a bad experience where I was not prepared and it mentally scarred me. I would then go on to have tremors l, shaking, dry throat and quivering voice. My career was being hindered so I began seeing a hypnotherapist, to no avail. I then came across propranolol and I feel like my old self, it’s actually incredible. Take 2x 40mg tablets 1 hour before the event and all symptoms were gone, allowing me to focus and be my old self.

I shake uncontrollably, dry mouth, sweat profoundly. I was so terribly embarrassed and every experience dampened my confidence further until it was rock bottom. I never thought to seek medicine until my early twenties - I was about to start my career and many interviews for jobs required presentations. I found Propranolol online, decided to try it and was prescribed 40mg tablets to take 1-2 times daily. It has been a complete game changer. Particularly when I made the jump to director level, it involves constant meetings and presentations where I'm expected to contribute. Propranolol takes away the physical symptoms so that I can focus and deliver. It won't take away mental nerves, but I've built up confidence to the extent that I no longer need to take it as frequently as before because of the positive experiences I've had.",user_156

Still already for few years I am the director of 200+ people company and I could not manage it without this drug. The only negative aspect of it is that you become dependant (not physically of course, but mentally). Personally I don't believe in therapy or other similar methods and not sure if it even possible to change anything for such harsh cases of public speaking anxiety as mine so I think it is the only possible solution.",Kareem

I have struggled all my life with severe public speaking anxiety. When you are young you are told it will get easier and you live in hope but for me it only got worse, particularly with work pressures and an increasing feeling of inadequacy. During a recent presentation at work I could not even speak, pounding heart, quivering voice, shaking...you know the symptoms! And then the shame and feeling of humiliation which seems to stay with you forever.  I've meditated, read countless psychology books, therapy and nothing ever worked. I came across this thread and although skeptical I decided to give it a go and Oh my god! I could not believe how calm I was in that presentation..I tried it again a couple of times for presentations and it worked every single time without fail. 40 mg an hour before and thats it.

It even got to the point early in my career where I’d have panic attacks even meeting 1 on 1 with my boss. It nearly ruined my career. Every time I presented in front of a group I’d suffer the worst physical symptoms of anxiety and fear. When I was 35, I was preparing to present in front of about 300 people and was crippled with fear leading up to the event. A friend recommended beta blockers so I visited my doc and got a prescription for 40mg. Well I smashed the presentation out of the park and since then my career has taken off! I now give presentations weekly and take 40mg 90 mins before. Beta blockers have been the best thing for my career and I’ll be forever in debt to modern medicine. Miracle drug!",Alejandr0

Since then it has really gotten in the way of my studies and work. I literally would fill with dread, go red, feel choking sensation, go blank. Well, reading these reviews were so comforting just to realise I'm not alone and so many others are going through exactly the same. I tried 40mg propanolol before a work video call where I was to be presenting. Normally doing any form of formal speaking sends me into a spin, I fret for ages and feel that horrible, gnawing nervousness and panic. Well this time was different! I took 40mg 1 hour before and I was cool as a cucumber - I love this stuff! My plan is to only use it for when I have to present and to eventually not need it but this allows me to not avoid the situation and train myself to lose the fear! Thanks propranolol.",Lexia

I just did two presentations today and knocked it out of the park. I had prepared like I usually do and was still anxious leading up (just because of my past experiences) but when it came time to perform, I had no rapid heartbeat or any other physiological responses that cause me to stutter, shake, etc. If you are like me and were wondering if this would even work, it does!

Over the years I advanced anyway and would be required to manage and speak in front of large groups. I still had the same dread and potential bad side effects.

But THIS MEDICATION is like a gift from God.

It was in the form of adrenaline rush, fast heart rate, tunnel vision, shaky voice.. pure panic.I've been trying to get more comfortable in these situations, so I joined Toastmasters for public speaking improvement (Highly recommend). But, I still needed that extra bit of confidence so my dr prescribed Propranolol (10mg) to be taken before the event.I had my first ever speech to give at toastmasters, which was really worrying me, so I took a 10mg first thing in the morning to help with the nerves that build during the day, then 10mg 90mins before, then 10mg 20mins before the speech (at 7:20PM). I actually really enjoyed the speech, absolutely no fear or symptoms and I got to work on being a better public speaker, rather than focusing on not dying and failing.

Such a fear that I would do anything to get out of speaking in front of classmates.

I walked out of the classroom and emailed the professor that I forgot my laptop somewhere and went to go find it before it was stolen (total lie). While presenting my heart pounds, I lose my breath, my voice quivers etc. It is beyond embarrassing and I stress days before I know I'm going to present. I finally went to my doctor after reading the reviews on this website and was prescribed propranolol. I took it today and felt so great during my talk in a 200 person lecture hall.

Now I don't need it nearly as much. It used to be that I couldn't even speak up in a small meeting.

I must stop Propranolol completely - I just don’t understand how I went from being able to tolerate 40mg or 20 mg with little to no side effects to taking a few mgs and having every side effect possible. (It’s really been the worst 3 weeks of my life) I’ve lost quite a lot of weight recently and now I’m quite slim - would that affect the metabolism of the drug or something? Does anyone have any alternative drug suggestions? I definitely need something!!!",M

I developed a crippling fear of public speaking in graduate school that has plagued me for almost 4 years. I Now realize that my mental illness was actually spawned from my fear of public speaking.  I now plan to wean off of my SSRIs. I would go to elaborate lengths to never have to speak in class or events. Once I told my professor that a family member was in the hospital so that I didn’t have to read a summary which every student had to prepare. So that he wouldn’t reschedule me, I pretended that I wasn’t in a state to focus on anything school related. I have suffered immensely. The thought of having to present will put me in the worst place for days. I just gave a speech which I in NO WAY could have avoided. And holy shit. You will feel like it’s not going to work.

So it takes a bit of trial and error to find your dosage for optimal performance and minimal to no side effects. Initially I took a high dose as I wanted to err on the side of more effect than not so I took 40mg in a 1 hr window. Still worked but had a pretty bad h/a and drowsiness after. With a little trial and error I have found the best dose to be 20mg 1.5 hr prior and another 20mg 30-45 minutes prior to speaking. This has been the perfect dose for me.

I took some in the morning after waking up, 40mg 3 hours later, and 40mg 3 hours after that which was 1 hour prior to a job interview in front of a panel of 6 people. I normally would've frozen up, got bad anxiety, and found a way to get out of there. But happy to say, not only did I stay, I think I did very well the whole interview! Didn't have to worry about anxiety at all! Yes, I did have normal nervousness leading up to the interview, but as soon as it began I felt more and more comfortable as it progressed and had no problem answering the questions.",Gabe
83,Propranolol,Performance Anxiety,10.0,,"March 17, 2019",18,"Stage fright since I was around 9-10 years old. Throughout high school I then avoided every presentation scenario possible by pretending to be sick etc. These few times that I had to do it were horrific, sweating hands, shaking voice etc. Starting a new job, I get given the dreaded task of having to prepare a 45 minute presentation for what was supposed to be 2 clients, but I arrive and they call in another 6 members of their team, 8 people in the room now. Took the same dose as before, 40mg 2 hours before and 40mg 1 hour before. Lets just say miracles do happen... I owned the room. Still had the nerves inside my head, but all physical symptoms gone. I would say this - it is crucial you are confident about the information you are presenting/talking about, but as long as you have prepared that, this drug takes away all physical symptoms. I walked out of that building with one of the best feelings i've ever had, it was like i'd finally overcome my fear.Propranolol has changed my life.",realreview

Public speaking gives me the worse anxiety, hands shake, voice starts to tremble, and the sweat starts to pour.

Once my first words came out standing in front of 200 people, I realized my anxiety suddenly disappeared almost to the point where I was excited to be up in front of everyone. After my speech was done, multiple people have told me that it was the best best man speech that they have ever witnessed. This came to a total surprise because I'm normally so nervous that I forget everything I am supposed to say. For the people that really want to know how this works its simple.  It also gives you the ability to think about what your saying before you say it rather then just rambling on. This drug took out my ""Ughhhhs"" and replaced it with short pauses.",Andrew

The dread before hand, during a presentation, standing in front of a group of people, shaky hands, dry mouth, stuttered voice, racing words. But it is not the be all and end all.It reduces the physical symptoms of anxiety.  It will stop you shaking somewhat.  It will stop you sweating somewhat, and help you get ""the edge"" to make that presentation or performance.  Your voice will not be as shakey.You must also try to improve you performance techniques.  This drug will help calm to a little extent some of the things that unsettle you during a presentation.  If you do not know presentation skills, if you do not know your subject you are presenting, then this drug will do little to aid it.  A pharmaceutical fix to you being unprepared will NOT WORK.For me, someone who takes this drug to help me through presentations - the type where I am on a podium in front of an audience of hundreds - it works to steady the nerves.",SJ73R

To take them 15 min before presentation is to close. The effect of propranolol is best if you take 2x20 mg 1 hour before the presentation. The effect of that dose is very good 1-3 hours after you took them. Also remember that you also must prepare very well what you shall present. Then the 2x20mg  will make you able to talk with no problems at all, even if you feel nervous in the brain. The nervousness will stay in brain and be blocked from choking the heart, throat and lungs.  Good luck brother:-)",Guest 210918

However for some reason I have this nagging performance anxiety that arises randomly when put on the spot to speak after I build something up too much in my head. Or when I know I have some presentation coming up.  I'm talking racing heart, catching my breathe, barely able to muster a couple of sentences. Feel like a damn fool. (I honestly think it all started when a grade 10 teacher would randomly pick me to read things in front of the class unexpectedly.. !) I'm a musician and can sing/play no problem in front of people, but when it comes to speaking without propranolol I'm a mess, with propranolol I'm quite good. Safe to say this drug has helped me immensely, including in my career, where many times you can't shy away, you have to face your fears.",richy

Even introducing myself caused me to have red blotches on my chest, shaking hands and a loud noise in my head that blocked my ability to say anything in front of people.  I could easily be further along in my career if I had known about this miracle drug earlier on.  I finally talked to my doctor about my stage fright. He prescribed Propranolol - 10mg up to however I needed.  The best part for me is that it was situational. Take about 45 min prior to presenting. I did not have time to try it out - took 30mg prior to speaking in front of approx 100 people and it worked beautifully!!!  This does not replace not being prepared. My anxiety was gone and I was truly focused on the message. As far as side effects, my throat was really, dry!  I had to take a drink a couple times during my presentation. This has died down since I've taken it more recently. After getting home, I crash. Overall, it's worth the side effects.",Professional Woman

But the whole thing worsened at age 48 after a couple of bad experiences and when I actually invented excuses to leave rooms - the flight in practice.  My therapist recommended Propranolol and it was fantastic!  Firstly, just reading all the reviews on this board, that fear of fear days before the event reduced sharply.  Then on the day of my presentation, heart rate and shakiness increased as usual hours before so I took 20mg 3hrs before, 10mg 90mins before and 5mg 30mins before.  I was not nervous.  Gave me control before I walked on the stage.  Different to others on this board, I felt it working before the speech and it gave me a total confidence boost.

Taking the Propanol relaxes me and I am doing much better sharing--it gets rid of the dreaded fight or flight feelings.

I found that taking it more than 2 hours before my presentation was ideal, that way it helped me stay calmer during the wait for my turn to go up on stage. It’s true that this doesn’t effect the feeling of dread before your event, but when you get on stage, can look at 75 of your colleagues and your heart isn’t about to explode, you’ll be amazed! You’ll hold that mic with no tremors, your muscles won’t tense up. As far as side effects, I’m pretty sure this pill makes me sweat more/feel hot which is so weird (felt this way even when testing in a nonstressful environment). It also took a few tests to get comfortable with the small amount of drowsiness / sluggishness.

Have been to numerous Dr’s over the years and tried everything - many antidepressants, Xanax, even MAOI’s. Nothing helped. In college I avoided classes and skipped presentations by making excuses.   The new company I work for has an annual meeting and I have to stand in front of 170 people and introduce myself. After fretting over this for months (contemplating resigning), I knew I had to find something to help. I finally found this board for Propranolol.  I went to my PCP and he prescribed 20 mg one hour prior to the meeting. What a blessing!  I was able to stand up there without blushing uncontrollably, no elevated heart rate and no adrenaline rush. I think 30mg might have even been better if I had to talk more. I am so happy to have found this!  Thank to all who left your stories on this board!",Nrrvous

Decided to give up acting as I couldn't cope with the extreme anxiety. I auditioned for and landed an amazing lead role but was immediately panicked by the thought of not being able to do it due to anxiety. The Dr prescribed me propranolol and oh my gosh does it work! I did three performances and took 20mg 90 mins before, 20mg 30 minutes before and 20mg in the interval and I loved every second of it. For the first time in years I actually enjoyed a performance. I had normal nerves (jitters, butterflies and dry mouth) but nothing unmanageable and they disappeared when I got into the swing of things. It felt like a miracle.

My adrenaline set my heart racing so fast I had to leave after about 30 seconds - And what is so horrible about it is that you are powerless against it. My doctor said just substitute the Propranolol at a lesser dosage and don’t take my Metoprolol when I have a presentation  This morning I gave a speech and took 15 mg of Propranolol instead of my 25 mg of Metoprolol about an hour before my speech.  At first I was worried because I could not tell if it would prevent the onset of a panic attack.  I walked up there and aced my speech.

My doctor told me to take 10mg 30 min before the speech and I tested it out and it didn't work. I ended up taking 30mg 1 hour before and 10mg 30 min before (that was probably too much because I am short and don't weigh a lot). I was initially nervous before the presentation but as soon as I got up there, I OWNED it. I have never felt more confident and calm.",iukiddo

But boys and girls please remember there is no such thing as a free lunch.    Propranolol is a powerful prescription drug and has side effects.  Specifically it dampens your emotions and your creativity.  So whilst you can give that speech confidently , sustained use will have a negative impact on your relationships and your performance.      Ultimately the best solution is to work on techniques to change your emotions and make you more confident when you speak.     Specifically practice for the moment when things might go wrong .

I started using it in graduate school and I had classmates come up to me after and ask me how I learned to speak so well.

I wasn't even thinking about the crowd, and when I walked down the aisle I was cool, calm, and collected. That drug truly saved me on the most important day of my life.

If you are crippled by Anxiety, mainly the body reaction (face muscle tense, weakening legs, voice, vision etc..) these will very much numb those things. It will not effect your mind however you will probably find your new found confidence will chip away and your anxiety and lead to recovery. I now use less frequently in areas i once would. good luck.",Malc D

337,Propranolol,Performance Anxiety,8.0,,"November 5, 2015",31,for me I'd say betablockers work well for performance/social anxiety.Reading the comments on this page sound so familiar to me.They will not stop you from being nervous but will bring you to a level where the physical aspects of your fear won't manifest ie pounding heart and trembling voice so once you start and realise this usually things will go better. I have found though that certain brands are better than others. I order mine online but yes they have been a lifesaver in certain situations such as introductions in meetings or big interviews etc. Normally for me around 30mg works well about 45 minutes to 1 and half hours before.,elpocketo

This sudden inability to do what I've always done led to depression.  I finally went to see my family physician.  She immediately prescribed me propanolol.
