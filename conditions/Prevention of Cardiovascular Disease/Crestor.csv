0,Crestor,Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,2,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 23, 2020",58,"I was prescribed Crestor after a triple bypass. 40mg daily and I finally weaned myself off of this drug after 7 1/2 months due to side effects. I was to the point where I could barely walk, my knees and feet were extremely painful. My shoulder joints had me in rehab therapy also. No energy, weight gain, and a thumb that now locks in place which is anything but pleasant. All these symptoms have significantly eased up and hoping to get back to 95% of my old self!",Lucy
1,Crestor,Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,2,,"August 9, 2017",59,"Took Crestor for four months and it lowered my cholesterol. Took it until my feet, shins, and calves went into cramps. Couldn't sleep, and could hardly walk. Cramps ended two days after quitting.  Cardiologist put me on it and my family doc took me off it and told me never to take it again.",chasp
