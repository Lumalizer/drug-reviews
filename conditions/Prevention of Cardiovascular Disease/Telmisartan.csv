0,Telmisartan,Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 5, 2021",3,"Micardis (telmisartan):Added 20mg to losartan and diuretic. Has helped BP. Now in week three, every kind of flu symptom. I thought it was the beginning of covid until I read the side effects. Everything but the fever. Will see how much longer I can stay on it. Maybe side effects will fade. Had I started at 80mg Iâ€™d think I would have been hospitalized.",Tired of covid
1,Telmisartan,Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,6,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 2, 2012",27,"I have been on Micardis HCT (telmisartan/hydrocholorothiazide) for over 5 years.  Lately my urine output has been less and I've developed a cough and leg cramp.  The leg cramp I assumed was from strain from exercise and the cough from dust due to construction work in the neighborhood.  However, after both conditions subsided the symptoms were still there. I checked the post marketing experience for Micardis and these symptoms were adverse signs.  Will consult with my physician as the warning says these symptoms should be reported immediately.",C1orrect
