0,Lipitor,Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 11, 2022",3,My experience with this drug was not very good. I was prescribed 10 mg 1 tablet to be taken per day. I was healthy with normal blood pressure and walked and exercised probably 4 miles per day and was generally fit and healthy. I was unable to take the tablet every day and ended up having to skip days because of the side effects. On day 3 it gave me a dizzy feeling and a sense of anger like wanting to snap at someone for no reason. Day 4 was a spacey feeling like floating and generally feeling like no desire to want to do anything. Went out for a walk got the most terrible muscle cramps in the calves which came and went. Also a panic anxiety feeling that lasted about a minute which felt like I was going to die and a general feeling of not being well. Then the doctor said take it every other day and this was causing me insomnia where I would sleep for a hour then be awake for 4 hours trying to sleep . Also very low sex drive and a feeling like I was being poisoned. Eventually came off it,here
1,Lipitor,Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,10.0,,"August 12, 2021",2,My chlosterol was high and after some blood work my doctor told me that my risk factor was high. I was put on atorvastatin 40 mg. My cholesterol went down and I am doing well. I have no side effects so far. I continue to do blood work and it's fine.,Prako
2,Lipitor,Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,2.0,,"February 3, 2021",12,"71 years. Heart attack with 5 stents. Automatically prescribed this as part of the ""cardiac cocktail"" as they call it. Had numbers on the getting slightly high for both cholesterol and BP before HA.Within 3 months this drug injured my liver and my GP stopped it. Continue to be tested to see if liver will recover. Numbers are down so I have my fingers crossed. I have been unable to use the gym due muscle pain which is now subsiding and hopefully I will be able to utilize  gym again . My mood was adversely affect with me becoming easily irritated and angry inappropriately. The pain over my shoulders and between my ribs was so painful and exhausting. And then it started to affect my memory which became so disconcerting. The daily dose was 80 and if the liver heals we will look at the minimum dose of a statin and see how that works",Jotdog
3,Lipitor,Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,10.0,,"September 22, 2020",25,"My cholesterol has always been in the normal range, about 145, although my LDL/HDL ratio, 90/55, is not optimal. I eat healthy,  10% body fat, work out over 300 days a year. But a heart scan at 60 gave me a shock, showed a lot plaque in my LAD, not good.  Started Lipitor 10mg daily, cholesterol dropped into the 90s, with LDL of 50.  Went to 10mg/5mg alternating days, last lipid panel showed cholesterol at 114, LDL 72.   I have never had any negative side effects.   Two very athletic friends with high cholesterol  used statins but quit because of muscle pain I  third athletic friend, with cholesterol of 300,  uses a statin, cholesterol into normal range with no side effects.  So if you have high cholesterol, don't be afraid to give a statin a try, start low and titrate up, if the side effects are too bad, quit, but you may be one of the lucky ones like me and my third friend, for whom a statin is very effective and does not have side effects.",John R
4,Lipitor,Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 16, 2019",101,"I was put on Lipitor after a mild heart-attack and stent placement. A short time after starting the script, my hands started hurting daily. They woke me up at night. Then the pain spread through out my body . It got so bad I could not push up off a chair or bed. Nothing helped. It was nerve and muscle pain. Took it for a year before the doctor finally heard me and took me off Lipitor to see if that was the cause. Within days the pain started letting up . Now 4 months later I’m back to normal. The pain was so bad I  thought I was terminal and felt that way to the point of writing out a will . Not everyone has this reaction . But pay attention if you start taking it and then have body pain. It can be dangerous.  I don’t know what long term effect may show up later from it. Now my hands still hurt daily from it . But less than when I was on the pill.",Product user

6,Lipitor,Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,1.0,,"September 14, 2016",128,"This drug is the absolute worst in the world for me. I have been on it for five years or more and being in excruciating pain for three of those years. I have been on Tylenol three, Codiene contin and hydromorphone and the doctor argued every time when I went in to get more pain meds. My legs have been in unbelievable pain for so long I can't honestly think of the time when I was not in pain. I just started reading about this and stopped taking Lipitor and told the doctor that I would never go back on it again. In about a month I have started to feel better but I am left with weak legs and a huge bill from the chiropractor, massage therapist, acupuncturist, exercise therapist and naturopathic doctor. I have had three trips to the hospital emergency department with no help in the long run. I am very very angry. I hope my lingering pain goes away soon.",Lollipop 2

8,Lipitor,Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,,,"September 11, 2009",127,"I used Zocor for first statin follin angioplasty December 2009. I must state that I have a high degree of sensitivity to medications and high degree of allergies. With Zocor, I experienced abdominal cramps increasing daily, muscle pain and off and on nausea. The cramps were a concern because I have experienced anemia in the past. My doctor, whom I trust with my life, suggested that I not take Zocor. After several months I had blood work, my LDH still higher than doctor wanted, so he prescribed Lipitor. I had same bad effects, but on a higher level. Fortunately, my doctor trusts my reports. There is one ""weird"" change that I have not shared with my doctor, but I am sharing with all of you. In several days, and increasingly, I am losing hair. Help me!",Anonymous
