0,Rosuvastatin,Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 18, 2021",1,"My doctor prescribed rosuvastatin which I took for a year and a half.  As a result, I suffered from low energy, memory loss, stiffness, and worst of all, severe muscle pain in both shoulders.  I could not raise my arms without intense pain.  The pain would flare up at night.  I did not have a full night sleep for 6 months.  Pain medication did not work.  It has been 1 year since I've stopped taking the statin medication.  Most of the pain is gone and my energy is back.  It was a long painful year that I will not repeat.  I quit taking statins and quit seeing the doctor that prescribed them.",Angry Patient

I was to the point where I could barely walk, my knees and feet were extremely painful. My shoulder joints had me in rehab therapy also. No energy, weight gain, and a thumb that now locks in place which is anything but pleasant. All these symptoms have significantly eased up and hoping to get back to 95% of my old self!",Lucy

5,Rosuvastatin,Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 14, 2020",18,Its so good to know that other people are having these terrible side effects from rosuvastatin and its not just my imagination.  It is very scary stopping taking it post heart attack but the muscle pain and weakness plus the bloatedness especially in the stomach etc. made me feel like I was being given a disease by this drug.  I will take my chances and monitor with my GP my cardio consultant won't like it but this is the second one I've tried and the side effects were the same but much worse..,Mandy
