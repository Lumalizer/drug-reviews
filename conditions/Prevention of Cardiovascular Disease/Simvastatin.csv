0,Simvastatin,Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 1, 2021",1,"I have been taking Simvastatin per request of my endocrinologist for a while. I am a life long sufferer of Psoriasis and thought for some time it had gotten worse. It got to the point where the itching/burning/skin cracking and bleeding was so bad I would wake up at night unable to sleep. I took antinhistamines, meds for the pain and more. I altered my diet and did all I could think of to get it to stop. Other symptoms were that I had diarrhea - explosive at times - fatigue, ears filed with liquid and more.  I finally thought about looking up my meds and seeing what the side effects are. I stopped taking the Simvastatin and within 2 days the rash began to heal around my neck. The goo behind my ears began to grow less. (I was having my hair stuck in goo most mornings) I am not going to take it any more. My fatigue is getting better. I truly believe I am allergic to this medicine. I cannot live like that. I will risk what it was supposed to help deter.",itchygirl924
