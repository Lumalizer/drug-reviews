0,Bactrim,Bacterial Skin Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2022",0,"I had cellulitis on my face, which swelled up significantly. Having worked in healthcare as a nursing aid for several years, I knew it the diagnosis before the physician confirmed it and realized antibiotics would be necessary. What I didn’t expect was a horrendous neuropsychiatric reaction to the medication. I was extremely nervous and could not sleep on day 3 and ended up having a severe anxiety attack. The episodic depression and odd behaviour such as standing in one place without moving for hours was frightening. Thankfully, after 2 MORE hospital visits, I was put on a Cephalosporin which eliminated the anxiety. My family physician has put this medication on my chart with beside the penicillin allergy (anaphylaxis) and wrote neuropsychiatric reaction. Bactrim is BY FAR the WORST medication I’ve ever be on.",Cam

This time,  beginning day 3 of 7 I felt like I was hypoglycemic, nervous, jittery, anxious, and like my heart was racing.  Day 6 of 7 my resting heart rate was 142, anxiety so bad I was crying. I called the hospital that prescribed it and the nurses spoke to ""talked to TWO doctors and NEVER heard of ANYTHING like that"" I said ""never mind that it's listed under severe side effects right?"" I stopped taking it then (Dr said I could keep taking it or stop, it doesn't matter) 24 hours later,  I'm back to normal.  Resting heart rate is 83. I'll never take Bactrim again.",Bex232

3,Bactrim,Bacterial Skin Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 6, 2021",0,"After I got what I thought was just a minor infection from a wound caused by an ill-fitting pair of Vans, things progressed to the point where I had a festering boil on my right foot. This was alarming, since I'm not immunocompromised, but I ended up spiking a fever of 102 degrees and was rushed to urgent care. The doctor had prescribed bactrim for the infection, specifcally 800/160mg of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim. I learned that this was a staph infection 3 days later when the wound culture results came back. The bactrim worked perfectly, with my staph infection clearing up in about a week, although it had made my acne slightly worse due to ""purging."" Apart from worsening acne, there were no other side effects. The pills were large but easy to swallow.",KillerVans
4,Bactrim,Bacterial Skin Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 1, 2021",1,"Bactrim is extremely effective - where other antibiotics might fail - but many doctors seem to underestimate the severity of side-effects (including uncommon ones). It is always difficult for me to be consistent with Bactrim dosage because I experience severe nausea and bouts of dizziness. It may be easy to complain, but I also recognise that an alternative might not be appropriate. Instead, I asked to also be prescribed anti-nausea medication. It's not fun, but it can be tolerable.",fleurfleur
5,Bactrim,Bacterial Skin Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 9, 2021",0,"I am sharing my experience because I want others to know there is hope from recovering from the extremely rare and life changing side effects that happened to me on Bactrim. I took it for 3 weeks for recurring acne cysts that kept forming behind my ear that started with an abscess being drained in front of my ear. The first week I felt ok but by the 2nd I could hardly eat and felt depressed and anxious. I quit taking it and the cysts kept coming so the dermatologist told me to keep taking it to clear up the infection. At 3 weeks I woke up with knee joint pain and a couple days later noticed my calves got very sore from doing normal things. I immediately quit the Bactrim but it was too late. A week later the pain was worse and I was very scared. Had every blood test done, MRIs on my knee and calf, and everything normal. I got worse as the months progressed and finally 6 months later I began to feel better. Had to quit my amazing job and was in the most depressed state  I'm healthy and 31 female.",Lilly
6,Bactrim,Bacterial Skin Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 20, 2021",0,"DO NOT take this if you are an athlete. 3 days into my treatment for a staph infection I started developing bilateral ankle pain. I brushed it off as nothing. However, the pain gradually increased over the next several days. By day 8 of my 10 day course my ankle pain was terrible. I have never had any ankle problems in my life until now! It feels like I am 90 years old! On top of that my achilles' also started acting up. I stopped the course right then. Yes, the medicine cleared up the infection, but the alternatives could have done the same. 4 days post last dose and I am still experiencing ankle pain and am currently unable to do any sort athletic activity. I am hoping this goes away soon. Demand an alternative if you are prescribed this.

I'd get one, it would go away, and I'd get another one. Doctors would put me on expensive medication that did nothing. Then I found the best dermatologist in the city and waited for four months to see him.  The doctor said I would take Bactrim/sulfa 500mg 2x's a day for 30 days. I did that and they disappeared. He said some people have to take them for life, others would take them for 10 days when you have any little sign or a boil or cyst. I start taking the medication and the cyst or boil disappears.

I was tachycardic, nauseous, gassy, itchy on arms/legs & had no appetite, jaw clenching & severe panic attacks. Plus, my symptoms were just getting worse. I was forming clusters of stinging/itching blisters around my cuts, my wrist was swollen & warm to the touch, & I felt feverish.I ended up getting prescribed Keflex to take with Bactrim starting Day 3. Side effects subsided & symptoms got better. Some nights I'd wake up at 3AM with a panic attack that lasted until I took my next dose. Other nights I'd be able to sleep just fine. Days 6-7, I got gas pain that felt like chest pain. The side effects didn't get better until Day 8. By then, all I had was some itchiness but no full-on rash.I never want to take this drug again.

So far so good here- still early on. I was on clindamycin for a tooth abscess. I must have been unknowingly treating a mild staph infection. When the clindamycin stopped the bacteria became aggressive. Now here I am on Bactrim. One sore has lightened in color and pressure within 24 hours. The other sores still hurt, so I took ibuprofen.   You won't get headaches if taken with pain/ fever reducer.  The clindamycin wrecked my gut but I actually haven't had a hard time with the Bactrim.
