0,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Bacterial Skin Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 14, 2022",0,"Bactrim DS (sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim):I was prescribed a 10 day supply of Bactrim DS for finger lesions infected with staph. Within 2 days I noticed that the infection started to heal. I also immediately experienced side effects of nausea, diarrhea, and heart palpitations. My doctor ordered me to have an echocardiogram/heart monitor as a result of irregularities she saw on my EKG while taking Bactrim. At the end of the 10 day supply, the infection had not cleared completely and I was given a second round. After starting the second round, I broke out into a rash that covered my entire body. I had to have a shot of Prednisone and take an additional 6 days. It has been more than a month since I took the last dose of Bactrim and I still am dealing with the original infection as well as being treated for chronic hives. I have not had heart palpitations since stopping the medication.",HivesbutnoBees
1,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Bacterial Skin Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2022",0,"Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim):I had cellulitis on my face, which swelled up significantly. Having worked in healthcare as a nursing aid for several years, I knew it the diagnosis before the physician confirmed it and realized antibiotics would be necessary. What I didn’t expect was a horrendous neuropsychiatric reaction to the medication. I was extremely nervous and could not sleep on day 3 and ended up having a severe anxiety attack. The episodic depression and odd behaviour such as standing in one place without moving for hours was frightening. Thankfully, after 2 MORE hospital visits, I was put on a Cephalosporin which eliminated the anxiety. My family physician has put this medication on my chart with beside the penicillin allergy (anaphylaxis) and wrote neuropsychiatric reaction. Bactrim is BY FAR the WORST medication I’ve ever be on.",Cam
2,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Bacterial Skin Infection,2.0,,"January 13, 2022",0,"This antibiotic may work very well for most, however I had severe nausea and nonstop, uncontrollable vomiting on the 2nd day of taking this. I literally just had to sit next to the toilet for hours because I couldn't stop vomiting bile. I finally called my doctor and was told to stop taking bactrim.  I have now been switched to cephalexin to see how that goes. My sister had taken bactrim as well and also had severe and uncontrollable vomiting, so I'm wondering if intolerances to sulfa just runs in my family. I was taking bactrim for a suspected trauma-caused cellulitis infection, and it did seem to help with that. The side effects were just way too severe for me.",Zees

I called the hospital that prescribed it and the nurses spoke to ""talked to TWO doctors and NEVER heard of ANYTHING like that"" I said ""never mind that it's listed under severe side effects right?""

She told me to take this medication I took 1 pill at 7pm, around 7:40pm I felt my body feeling all kinds of sensations from head to toe. Around 10pm I noticed my hands were completely swollen!!! I got so scared, my right hand looked like a glove that got blown up, my left hand the veins were popping up so high and big, I called a 24/7 nurse line that comes with my insurance, she told me to keep my hand elevated and rest it and if it gets any worse to go to the ER. it took a day for my hand to go back to normal, I took no more doses, this is not for me",Kar

This was alarming, since I'm not immunocompromised, but I ended up spiking a fever of 102 degrees and was rushed to urgent care. The doctor had prescribed bactrim for the infection, specifcally 800/160mg of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim. I learned that this was a staph infection 3 days later when the wound culture results came back. The bactrim worked perfectly, with my staph infection clearing up in about a week, although it had made my acne slightly worse due to ""purging.""

It is always difficult for me to be consistent with Bactrim dosage because I experience severe nausea and bouts of dizziness. It may be easy to complain, but I also recognise that an alternative might not be appropriate. Instead, I asked to also be prescribed anti-nausea medication.

It started with my face burning so badly it woke me up out of my sleep to find my entire body red, itchy, burning and the right side of my face in hives. I took a Benadryl and was able to comfortably sleep until the next day. I naturally have anxiety and noticed it flare up the next day, along with random muscle aches and noticeable fatigue. I go to the gym often so muscle soreness isn't uncommon, I also have natural anxiety about any and everything regarding my health.

I took it for 3 weeks for recurring acne cysts that kept forming behind my ear that started with an abscess being drained in front of my ear. The first week I felt ok but by the 2nd I could hardly eat and felt depressed and anxious. I quit taking it and the cysts kept coming so the dermatologist told me to keep taking it to clear up the infection. At 3 weeks I woke up with knee joint pain and a couple days later noticed my calves got very sore from doing normal things. I immediately quit the Bactrim but it was too late. A week later the pain was worse and I was very scared. Had every blood test done, MRIs on my knee and calf, and everything normal. I got worse as the months progressed and finally 6 months later I began to feel better. Had to quit my amazing job and was in the most depressed state  I'm healthy and 31 female.",Lilly

I brushed it off as nothing. However, the pain gradually increased over the next several days. By day 8 of my 10 day course my ankle pain was terrible. I have never had any ankle problems in my life until now! It feels like I am 90 years old! On top of that my achilles' also started acting up. I stopped the course right then. Yes, the medicine cleared up the infection, but the alternatives could have done the same. 4 days post last dose and I am still experiencing ankle pain and am currently unable to do any sort athletic activity. I am hoping this goes away soon. Demand an alternative if you are prescribed this.

Never any severe pain, or vomiting etc. THE METHOD I USED - I drank on average 5 liters of water a day. NO other drinks. I took my first one with brunch and the second one with dinner. Typically 7-10hrs apart. Also, usually easily digestible foods. Nothing heavy and greasy. To avoid upset stomach.

I waited a weeks before I saw a doctor, this was dumb, but I am uninsured.  She prescribed this medicine for 14 days (twice daily) and Bacitracin ointment. The Doctor also tested this medicine with a culture from my nose and she told me that this will kill the type of Staph I have (and it was a normal variety, not MRSA).  However, after the 14 days my nose was still somewhat infected.  Follow up visit with same doctor that week where she just prescribed the same stuff again, and it produced the same results. I am now working on my FOURTH 14 day supply of this antibiotic, and the infection is still holding ground. ",Anonymous

I am so happy that this is working and thank God that it was not an expensive medication either considering I am a widow and single mom. I would tell anyone with this problem to try this first and skip anything else. It is just an infection. Best of luck to you all.,Unsound

It started out as a few pimples and quickly erupted into large, painful, pussy boils with blisters after breaking open. After trying every cream imaginable, my doctor prescribed Bactrim and the rash was literally better over night. In a few days, it was cleared up completely! He did, however, experience a lack of appetite, lethargy, upset stomach, and diarrhea. Nothing severe, but a little uncomfortable for him...but not as bad as his painful rash had been!",mommytofour
