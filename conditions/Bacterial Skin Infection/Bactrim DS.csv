0,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Skin Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 14, 2022",0,"I was prescribed a 10 day supply of Bactrim DS for finger lesions infected with staph. Within 2 days I noticed that the infection started to heal. I also immediately experienced side effects of nausea, diarrhea, and heart palpitations. My doctor ordered me to have an echocardiogram/heart monitor as a result of irregularities she saw on my EKG while taking Bactrim. At the end of the 10 day supply, the infection had not cleared completely and I was given a second round. After starting the second round, I broke out into a rash that covered my entire body. I had to have a shot of Prednisone and take an additional 6 days. It has been more than a month since I took the last dose of Bactrim and I still am dealing with the original infection as well as being treated for chronic hives. I have not had heart palpitations since stopping the medication.",HivesbutnoBees
1,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Skin Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2021",0,"So I've had a small boil that turned into what I believe is a carbuncle because there were many heads/sore spots now about 5 or 6 all gathered around that 1 boil I noticed before it got bigger, its like they are all bunched up in a gumdrop/hill looking shape. The area would not drain on its own and the hill looking shape feels firm to the touch, I finally went to the doctor after not healing or draining on its own after 4 weeks. She told me to take this medication I took 1 pill at 7pm, around 7:40pm I felt my body feeling all kinds of sensations from head to toe. Around 10pm I noticed my hands were completely swollen!!! I got so scared, my right hand looked like a glove that got blown up, my left hand the veins were popping up so high and big, I called a 24/7 nurse line that comes with my insurance, she told me to keep my hand elevated and rest it and if it gets any worse to go to the ER. it took a day for my hand to go back to normal, I took no more doses, this is not for me",Kar

Over the next few days I had barely any appetite and wanted to sleep all day.  I felt like I could not get enough sleep.  I was also extremely sensitive to the sunlight which only enhanced my desire to sleep more.  Over all the infection did not appear to change in the 3 1/2 days on the antibiotic but that is not to say it did not work.  I just was not able to function on it therefore I called my doctor for something else.,GloryGirl2005

I could not eat for a week because of the terrible sores in my mouth. I was prescribed Cefidinr and after being on that for 3 days had no improvement, but as soon as they put me on Bactrim it started clearing up within hours!",Anonymous

51,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Skin Infection,8.0,,"June 7, 2011",33,"I have been on Bactrim for 1 week now and my skin is almost completely clear. I had a very bad infection across my chin and up to the right side of my nose, small red pumps, and and itchy rash that would peel over and got infected. Within 2 days I noticed a huge difference. This medicine saved my life for sure. Dermatitis and skin issues on the face can really do a number on your self esteem. I am back to almost clear skin and so so happy. A little tired and was dizzy at first but promethazine helps with that if your doctor can prescribe it, helps with nausea. other then that, this medicine rocks.",Anonymous
52,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Skin Infection,7.0,,"June 2, 2011",20,"I was prescribed Bactrim 2x a day for 30 days, for Staph Infection. However, after taking it for about 7 days, I developed a rash. The rash did not itch, but started at my shoulders and went down to legs. I've now begun taking Benadryl to counteract symptoms. So far, it hasn't helped, rash still there. As far as the Staph infection, it looks a lot better.",Anonymous
53,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Skin Infection,8.0,,"April 18, 2011",29,"I found that within a day of taking Bactrim the infection got better, which was GREAT because I had had it for a while.  I experienced a few side effects, dizziness, lack of energy, insomnia if I took the pill a few hours before bed (I found to overcome this I took the pill just before going to sleep) and headaches but they seemed to dissipate after 2-3 days.",Anonymous
54,Bactrim DS,Bacterial Skin Infection,10.0,,"May 2, 2009",39,I have been using this for about 6 days now and already notice a huge difference. The first few days I was very tired but it was well worth it to get rid of the skin condition that came from nowhere. I am 32 and my skin had never done this before. I am so happy that this is working and thank God that it was not an expensive medication either considering I am a widow and single mom. I would tell anyone with this problem to try this first and skip anything else. It is just an infection. Best of luck to you all.,Unsound
