0,Clonazepam,Sleep Paralysis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 8, 2020",10,"I put up with parasomnia (hallucinations and acting out dreams) for 5 years before being properly diagnosed and put on Clonazepam. Started out at 0.5mg but increased to 1mg, and went from having regular hallucinations and ‘active dreams’ every night to sleeping solidly and feeling refreshed every day. This was my miracle drug. I’ve been on it for 5 years now... Currently weaning off it while pregnant, but I miss my sleep! It’s good stuff.",Elbee
1,Clonazepam,Sleep Paralysis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 26, 2020",16,"I'm 61 yrs old. I started having sleep paralysis with hallucinations upon waking when I was 17 yrs old. It happened ver frequently. I started taking Clonazepam in my early 40s. After a few years I realized I wasn't having this horrible experience anymore. I did an experiment by going off Clonazepam twice and both time the sleep paralysis with hallucinations came back. I will take this medication until the day I die! This medical condition, especially with hallucinations, is so horrible, I would never even wish it on my worst enemy. I hope this helps even one individual!!!",Bing
2,Clonazepam,Sleep Paralysis,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 5, 2017",11,"I've had sleep paralysis on and off for years but never asked my doctor if there was any medication that treated it, didn't even mention it happened to me every once in a while cuz it wasn't every night. However, I got prescribed clonazepam for my anxiety/panic disorder. One night I kept experiencing the tremors and sleep paralysis while trying to fall asleep and I researched how to stop it from happening and came across clonazepam. I then took my medication and boom! Was able to fall asleep shortly after with no disturbances. I just had another episode last night and had not taken my clonazepam for a few days since I don't need it everyday, and once I took it, it went away and I slept like a baby. 100% recommend this medication, it works.",nghtmres
