2,Ibuprofen,Back Pain,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 16, 2020",3,"Motrin (ibuprofen):Motrin is truly the best form of Ibuprofen, it seems to last a lot longer than other brands. I highly recommend it.",BeeRealz
3,Ibuprofen,Back Pain,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 16, 2020",1,"Ibuprofen is great, I don’t know how I would live without it, it’s very effective but sometimes I have to mix it with Acetaminophen to help the pain relief longer.",BeeRealz
4,Ibuprofen,Back Pain,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 22, 2020",4,"Advil (ibuprofen):The new ad with the catchy songwe want to praise you for your strength seems to empower you with the thought that you keep strong through all your pain and maybe Advil helps this too. It does, it did for me. I took two in the AM and two in the pm for 3-4 years and kept doing anything physical I wanted to- until I was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease CKD. I only have 30% kidney function and I am not able to take any NSAIDs any more. I can only take acetaminophen and I am in constant pain because acetaminophen does not reduce inflammation like Advil does. BE CAREFUL the ads say  what pain?  well when your kidneys won't function properly you will learn what pain is when you can’t take Advil anymore because you took it for too long and then a Dr says would you like me to prescribe an opioid for you pain now? No thank you. Read The Label!!!",Chris
5,Ibuprofen,Back Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 29, 2020",0,600mg ibuprofen tablets from Ascend Laboratories hardly worked as an anti-inflammatory compared to the 600mg tablets from Amneal Pharmaceuticals which worked very well for me.,Bubba
6,Ibuprofen,Back Pain,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 15, 2020",4,"Works like a charm, mainly for headache but can reduce the pain in your back as well, definitely recommend ibuprofen for headache and other things as well.",Jared
7,Ibuprofen,Back Pain,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 12, 2018",7,"Ibuprofen certainly seems to reduce the pain in my back, and has been very effective in eliminating pain in my toothache. But it can (mildly) upset my stomach, especially if I take it without food. Even if taken with food, My Stomach can feel 'strange' and feel as if something is irritating it. It's hard to properly describe. I could be imagining it. There is increased intestinal (loud) rumbling and other noises as well. Still, it seems to work where paracetamol is totally ineffective.",psychlops

9,Ibuprofen,Back Pain,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 17, 2017",16,"Advil (ibuprofen):I bought the New Advil minis and they stink, They did nothing for my back pain as the originals did. I took 2 gels at once and they usually work right away, but these minis did nothing. I don't believe there is 200mg in each one as they say. Why change something that works, they lost my business..I hope others test it and let everyone know if they worked for them.",Roeb

11,Ibuprofen,Back Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 4, 2015",15,"Advil (ibuprofen):Awful, to say the least. Don't even consider this if you have anything more than a headache, and even that won't be tolerable after taking a few of these.",L5-S1 hern/nerve damage
12,Ibuprofen,Back Pain,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 23, 2015",15,"Advil (ibuprofen):This works very well for me, and needless to say is readily available.  The trick is knowing when to take one or when to take two.",Marcus99
