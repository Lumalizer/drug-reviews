0,Voltaren,Back Pain,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 11, 2022",10,"I've had severe unrelenting L4-5 radiating pain, searing sciatica, and overall spine fatigue.I  am only 56 years old and normal BMI so I'm not sure why I've even got so many spine issues that are unrelieved by therapy or posture improvement. That aside, my dr rx'd me voltaren pills..and honestly, the side effects were scary. Then I saw a gel available. I turned around went back to my drs room and asked about the gel, his nurse said she had a sample + $5 off coupon. I've used the gel for 2 days and I already feel noticeably less pain. I'm a little concerned that all the American articles say to not use it on your back, but Australian and New Zealand articles seem to use the emulgel voltaren which looks to be the about the same thing to me. Mine has 1% active ingredient and I think the emulgel . I will ask my doctor when I see him in a month.but so far I would say it is definitely a noticeable difference even after one day.. of course if I develop a side effect I will update this review.",Ambrid
1,Voltaren,Back Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 18, 2022",3,I just started getting terrible back pain. Went to the doc and realized that I have arthritis. She prescribed Voltaren and the pain went away immediately. My whole body felt so much better. I have not felt any side effects. It’s a great drug.,Anonymous
2,Voltaren,Back Pain,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 31, 2021",1,Voltarten works 100% on Back pain that comes from Fibromyalgia. I’ve suffered for years with horrible lower back pain from Fibromyalgia muscle pain. I first use Real Time a muscle ache creme. I rub that first which opens the pores with Menthol then I apply the Voltaren and almost immediately I get relief. I’ve tried about everything over the counter and prescription and either I had reactions or no relief. This combination works 100% without burning my skin or other reactions. This along with my prescription Hydrocodone works totally. I also use both in other areas of pain and it works. It keeps me totally out of pain during the day and also at bedtime so I can get a good nights sleep.,Dave
3,Voltaren,Back Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 24, 2021",19,"I have arthritis in lower back.  Physical therapy helped my pain, but not completely.  The addition of Voltaren use has brought me tremendous additional back pain relief.    My pain level is the lowest it’s been in 20 years.    I am so thankful that this product exists!!!",Jomi5

Now that I’m taking Voltaren daily I have much less pain and inflammation, more range of motion and get so much more out of my physical therapy sessions. I finally feel like I am getting my life back.",Mbz
5,Voltaren,Back Pain,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 21, 2019",33,"My Voltaren is destined for the trashcan. I used the product several times for moderate back pain over a one year period.  Did absolutely nothing for me. It's a pricey product, not covered by my insurance, and  proved ineffective.  I switched back to the cheaper products on the market which are much more effective.",Disappointed
6,Voltaren,Back Pain,10.0,,"May 9, 2019",65,"My back was in pain and I was bent over and couldn't stand up straight, the pain was bad and I have taken  strong pain meds for years.I started taking Voltaren 75mg.The next day I was 75% better. The following day my back pain I was 100% better, so  I am very pleased that the voltaren tablets worked.",Marky
7,Voltaren,Back Pain,9.0,,"May 11, 2017",45,"Personally it's the best gel I have used to warm up my back muscles, making the muscles feel like I've stretched for 15 - 20 min. Don't expect miracles. You should not be expecting this gel to completely alleviate back pain. It's not supposed to do that. It's supposed to get your muscles to a place where you can do other things more easily to attain painlessness via a combined effort. For a lot of back pain, if you use the gel in conjunction with consistent stretching (twice daily) whilst consuming the correct diet and being active enough to lower your body weight, you will be in a much better place in no time - so be encouraged! The gel really helps you do the things you need to do physically to get to that place.",IrishAido

10,Voltaren,Back Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 2, 2016",46,I have bulging and degenerative discs from my cervical all the way down to my lumbar.   I would have it rubbed on my back on days when I couldn't get out of bed or stand up. The cream along with my meds would put me to sleep and then allow me to get up pain free. It's really great after a long day.,GummieBear09

23,Voltaren,Back Pain,5.0,,"June 12, 2009",44,This medicine is very good for those who can take it. At first it worked very well for me. By the third refill I had developed a extreme allergy to this drug. First sign was extreme itching and severe sweating with dizziness. If this happens go to hospital quickly and stop taking the drug. When this started Doctors can't always determine it quickly enough as in my case. Second time wasn't as severe but by the third time when my reactions started I knew. So please don't take again if you get these reactions. But I do highly recommend this drug for those able to use it.,LazarusL1
