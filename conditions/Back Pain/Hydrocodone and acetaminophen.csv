Share it with as many people as you know: People are being forced to buy drugs on the street, stronger, non-regulated, and often deadly alternatives to their pain medications, because of the re formulations that have taken place in the commonly prescribed hydrocodone formula. I have been a pain patient and practitioner for over 25 years. Norco is an easy medication to prescribe - while addictive in nature, if taken as prescribed, the risks are fairly mitigated.People are dying because they cannot get access to a low risk medication that works. SHARE THIS MESSAGE. It feels like no one is hearing us!!! Due to pressure, lawsuits, and the like, the reformulated generic Norcos are very unpleasant. The active ingredient is the same, but it isn't derived the same way. Much of it is derived abroad. Qualitest/Par/Endo formulated the yellow ones that the pain patients here refer to. It worked well and didn't create the side effects of the others.",Michael Wilsher

Worked like magic was able to live a normal life, until they no longer manufactured brand. Struggled with different manufactures making generic. Had a lot of reactions and no real pain relief until l found it made by Amneal. Only mom and pop pharmacy was able to keep it in stock for me but the trip to the pharmacy was long and stressful. The chain pharmacy like CVS has absolutely no interest in helping people that can only take it made by your preferred manufacturer and say there is no difference even if your Dr writes on the script the manufacturer you can only use. CVS sneaks others past you and you go home to see it's made by another company. You tell the pharmacy they have the wrong manufacturer and they will not refund your money or order the one you need without a new RX from your Dr. so because you are out of the medication you try it and have nothing but problems.

Today, almost a decade later, the Qualitest brand which is the yellow has been discontinued and now I have M367 and the pain is bad.

I will also stop making all my supplemental health insurance payments and work on a plan to become an expat of U.S. It is a shame I have to make plans to leave after building USA infrastructure for close to 40 years of heavy construction work. The daily, close to 40 years use of heavy construction tools that caused vibration throughout the body created multiple levels from neck to lumber of herniations and stenosis.

And on top of that I've been having allergic reaction problems since they switched to these brands. I have a DMAPA allergy and asked if these were Canadian pharma, (loaded with DMAPA), the Pharmacist said no. I reported mine to the DEA twice already. I suspected that they were counterfeit. I was on percocet-they dropped me down (levels were too low at pain mgmt drug screen), and I was also having an allergic reaction to it as well.

They are weak and being in pain daily is no fun , to put it mildly. I have a pain management Dr. But she says my options are either this or some implant pain pump. Not gonna happen. The opioid crisis is the cause for those who really need medication to suffer because of the pill mills and unscrupulous Drs that prescribed them to those who either sell them or abusing the drug.

I was given the yellow pill which after I researched show that is made by Qualitest pharmaceutical. This brand of acetaminophen/hydrocodone does absolutely nothing nothing! I even called and asked my doctor if I could take extra because it wasn’t doing anything. Even after that I had absolutely zero relief. Believe me someone could take two or three of these things and get absolutely no relief if you catch my drift.  So how in the world do you get a chemical analysis to see if there’s even anything in there to help with pain relief. My back was hurting so bad I even had to leave work early. I can’t do anything around the house I can’t complete my job I can’t do anything because of the pain. What are we supposed to do with this company probably are not even putting the right amount of pain medication in it.

32,Hydrocodone and acetaminophen,Back Pain,4.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 24, 2021",9,Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone):I do think it was some TV reporter a few years ago that exposed the research done by some pharmaceuticals that found a way to reduce the instant high affects with opioids that caused these continuous deadly overdoses by changing the content of the pill so that it didn't cause quick highs. If I remember correctly the FDA was requested by the govt. to do this research.  Chewing the older pills or absorbing them in the mouth rather than swallowing them brought about that instant high. The downside is that the patients on the study reported less effectiveness of the new pills for actually controlling pain due to reduced absorption.  I agree with all of the reviews stating their experiences with reduced benefits and especially the mallinckrodt.  I too have different worse or less side affects with all the generics out there.,Screaminouch!

I can remember in my past a long while ago I could take one Percocet and it would last all day.  Now you don’t even feel them period.  So I totally agree with everyone here that these new drugs do not seem to have the medication active ingredient in them that they say they do.  Maybe it is time to write to your senator and ask if they can help make a change for people like us that are not getting relief from these meds they give today.
