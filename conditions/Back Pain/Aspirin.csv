1,Aspirin,Back Pain,10,,"October 27, 2013",27,"Asprin is much better,than Advil,Aleve for back pain and pain in joints. It's cheap and effective. The biggest disadvantage for aspirin is gastrointestinal disturbances.",cccv2

3,Aspirin,Back Pain,9,,"November 14, 2011",34,"Bayer Aspirin (aspirin):It works.  I always take Bayer when I have a headache, and it always works.  I took store brand aspirin for four days battling a headache, and it just DID NOT work at ALL.  Popped two expired Bayer today and they still worked like magic on both my back pain from menstruation and the headache I haven't been able to get over.  I feel so much better that I literally went online to write a review about it.  If that doesn't convince you, I don't know what will.  Try it, it works.",Anonymous

6,Aspirin,Back Pain,10,,"June 29, 2009",24,"Have tried Motrin, Aleve, Tylenol for back pain and nothing works as well. Take it with food and take a brand that is coated and even the few side effects are lessened.  It's still the safest and most effective in my personal view.",Renlynn
