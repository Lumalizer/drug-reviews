0,Xodol,Back Pain,10,,"May 15, 2011",23,"I have kidney and liver problems. So far this is the best pain medicine that I have found with the least amount of Tylenol or Ibuprofen.  Xodol has half the Tylenol than Lortab so it is easier on my liver. As far as how well it works, for me, it works very well most of the time as long as I take it before the pain gets too bad. I would recommend it over any of the other pain medicines I have taken.",GeorgeD2
