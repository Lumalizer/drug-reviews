7,Tramadol,Back Pain,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 5, 2021",0,"I've had chronic back pain after an accident which has never gone away. I've had three back operations which helped some but also have given me left  testical pain since my second operation which comes and goes . I've had so many meds I can't remember them all now. Tramadol with ibrufen (800's) is the best for me as I can function on them with other meds also at times providing I can lie down when pain levels start to raise or sit down but still pretty much house bound. Other meds I've had may be better for pain but I can't function on them and really hated them and what they did to me. I have now been on them for approximately 10 long years now. For me, they are the best to work out between pain and function. I have heard cannabis cbd oil is very good but New Zealand government won't make it legal.

I also have such allergic asthma and have taken every drug ever made for it and surprised I'm still alive. Tramadol 50mg clears up my asthma/sinus quite effectively and better than all asthma drugs.

21,Tramadol,Back Pain,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 24, 2020",28,"So I was on alprazolam for over a year for anxiety and seizure related purposes and a few weeks back, I pulled my entire back out and didn't know what to do. Went to the doc and was prescribed tramadol. It has helped with my anxiety and pain which I didn't think would happen. I take 100mg a day but I find I can't sleep on these so I take 50mg in the morning (8am) and again at 4pm so that by 9pm I can take my melatonin and go to sleep. I've heard long term use causes horrible withdrawals so I'll prob take it for another week and should be good as new. So in conclusion if you got anxiety and really bad back pain or pain in general, I'd recommend it but only for short term use.",Dave

This drug is pushed by drug companies to replace narcotics that, with responsible use, actually relieve pain very well. Tramadol is called ""baby aspirin"" by many people who have been pushed into using it. Meanwhile, Tramadol includes ingredients that can cause suicidal thoughts or a potentially lethal serotonin syndrome when it interacts with other medications. It did nothing to relieve my lower back pain after a hard fall. I have been in agony.

Once I'm up and focused on work, I can usually get through the day without any more. Without it, I probably would not be able to sleep at night or work in the day.

41,Tramadol,Back Pain,3.0,,"September 30, 2019",25,"Took tramadol for 14 years as a result of shoulder injury and ongoing issues. Worked wonders throughout time frame for moderate pain. By the end I was taking 100mg three times daily. As I entered my 50s  I believe the long term use triggered an acute mental health nightmare of anxiety. I slowly weaned myself down over  2 weeks. The physical  withdrawals were significant, particularly night sweats, intestinal complications and constant tremors. After six months of non-use  I slowly returned to normal and all physical symptoms of withdrawal were absent. My mental health is well one year later and under consult of psychiatry . Indeed Tramadol took the edge off of pain but retrospectively was also leaned upon for the opiate like feel good mentally. Shoulder pain still sucks but much better than loosing my mind  and now I am  staying well grounded. I’m stunned to hear the off script uses for depression. Maybe initially it’s all good - but there are classic opioid consequences.",Bill

I would rather go thru hydrocodone withdrawals 10x over to the withdrawal off of tramadol. Norco withdrawal took around 5-7-10 days. Had been thru that many times over 11 years.

Apparently my doctor did NOT know that Tramadol is a partial antidepressant and he prescribed me this medication for a herniated disc in my back.  For one, this medicine is useless as a painkiller for me.  It doesn't even touch the pain.  And then on top of it, Tramadol induced the worst manic episode of my life leaving me severely anxious, wound up, restless, unable to sleep, and in a dark place.  I've almost gone to the emergency room about 5 times because of my thoughts.  I finally googled tramadol and bipolar disorder and realized that I should never have been prescribed this medication.  I failed to read the paperwork the pharmacy gave me because I had taken this medication in the past, before being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and had no adverse reactions.",Jen

It affects opioid receptors in the brain and gut, and acts in the same way as a serotonin uptake SSRI / SNRI drug.  So, it makes you feel good and acts like an anti-depressant.  For short term use (very short) it's useful, but it is highly addictive in spite of what the docs and FDA say.  The withdrawals are insanely awful if you have taken it for more than a week or so - since you are withdrawing from an opiate and an anti-depressant.

Stay safe & check this site for drug interactions.Doctors prescribe Tramadol for pain they don't consider severe enough for say percocet or vicodin, but severe enough that it still needs an opiate to manage the pain. Tramadol is the little brother of the opiate/opioid family. People don't talk about ""Tramadol abuse"" but it is very addictive and for tons of people it simply does not cut it for chronic pain",IrishHillbilly

I was prescribed 2 things at 2 different times: Lortab 7.5 and tramadol 50 mg. At first I took the (opiate) Lortab only to relieve pain. Anyhow, I knew I'd run out of them eventually, and I did. Today the expected withdrawal began: rebound pain, tense & achy legs, bad stomach and weakness. Typical opiate withdrawal. I worked all day like that. Tonight I decided to take a tramadol, to see if it'd relieve the yucky withdrawal. WOW! After 1 hour I feel like a totally new person. An amazing change. It works better than I expected.
