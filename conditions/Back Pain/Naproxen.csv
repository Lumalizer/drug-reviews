I couldn't walk for 6 hours. As the drug began to leave my system things began to get better. I had to wait 96 hours to take Ibuprofen again which is my miracle for pain. During the hours the Aleve was leaving my system I got slowly better. I followed all the rules. No alcohol, nodrugs that might interact but this drug was a total disaster. These drugs are both nsaids - they should react similarly. But there has to be a difference in the way they mix them or the non-activeingredients. Any similar experiences?",Cowgirl15

I would struggle to stand up from a sitting position. The pain would go down my legs and into my abdominal region, and have been trying all different kinds of treatment from gels to moderate pain killers all with different degrees of success, but none that actually took the pain away completely, and not for any length of time. I was eventually prescribed Naproxen and in less than a day I felt a different person. The pain has gone completely from everywhere.

Xrays revealed nothing (although at 62 I highly suspect some type of osteoarthirits), 6 sessions of therapy to correct what was a suspect patellar tracking disorder aggravated the condition, chiropractor, massage, Voltaren gel rubbed in the knee. Nothing brought long term relief. Three weeks ago I decided to give Alleve a try. And so far it's worked. I take one before bed. My knee occasionally hurts, but the tight hamstrings and sciatic have cleared up.",tenaj52

As I was sitting down comfortably and had to get up to make dinner, I noticed drastic change that I was in lesser pain, but still in pain. I was able to move better than I have been in two months. The physical therapy was helping, but it was a slow progress due to my work environment that requires me to lift heavy things. The massages were a bit helpful, but I wanted it everyday sort of a thing to get a relief. I ended up taking 2 Advils, but it wasn't enough for me. I told the doctor and she gave me this!

I took the dosage, and the pain was gone in absolutely no time.The dosage of 2 Naproxen Tablets will last me 2-3 days before the effects wore off. However, I still had difficulty walking for a moderate to long amount of time before the sciatica came back, and my lower back felt weak. No side effects either, so that's a plus.",Anonymous
