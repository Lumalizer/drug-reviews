0,Aleve,Back Pain,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 13, 2022",0,"After taking this drug for back pain, I had the most painful experience of my life, more painful than back surgery. I couldn't walk for 6 hours. As the drug began to leave my system things began to get better. I had to wait 96 hours to take Ibuprofen again which is my miracle for pain. During the hours the Aleve was leaving my system I got slowly better. I followed all the rules. No alcohol, nodrugs that might interact but this drug was a total disaster. These drugs are both nsaids - they should react similarly. But there has to be a difference in the way they mix them or the non-activeingredients. Any similar experiences?",Cowgirl15
1,Aleve,Back Pain,1,,"January 6, 2021",8,"This has to be the most unproductive company on the face of this planet, this product does absolutely nothing for you other than give you false hope. I can’t for the life of me understand how they are even allowed to put back relief on the front of their bottle. Not only is that theoretically impossible for these generic pills to fast target your back pain but it actually doesn’t do a single thing to benefit your body in any way shape or form.",Anonymous

3,Aleve,Back Pain,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 13, 2020",15,"I had real lower back muscle pain for two weeks. Dr gave me Cyclbenzaprine-- not good. Saw an Aleve commercial on TV, it was a back pain reliever. Within 15 minutes of taking it sharp pain was reduced dramatically. That's all I can tell you. I still am on it and have no bad comments.",Rob

6,Aleve,Back Pain,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 23, 2019",24,I have been taking norco 5mg a day for a bad lower back pain and of course this really did remove all pain. But many countries don't have this drug so my pharmacy said to try Aleve. I was so surprised that I still can't believe that it took 95% of my pain away. I travel with Aleve and won't have problems in bringing drugs into other countries.,ken

12,Aleve,Back Pain,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 24, 2016",30,Not as good as THC but very effective for me. One wants a solution that allows your mind to not constantly be aware of pain. This does the job for me.,Anonymous
13,Aleve,Back Pain,4,,"January 3, 2016",23,"I have severe scoliosis so my pain is pretty strong most days. My doctor recommended Aleve so I take 2 caplets (440mg) and there is a bit less pain for a few hours. The package says it works for 8-12 hours, but I'm lucky if it stretches out to 5. Takes my pain from a 7 (out of 10) to a 3 or 4. And then I can't drink for another 8 hours which is no fun.",Steeeeve

15,Aleve,Back Pain,4,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 4, 2015",23,"This should be the first thing you take when you realize you have back pain. At the very least this will take the sharp edge off and give you enough time to get to Urgent Care or an immediate doctor appointment. I have noticed that for extended use (2-5 days) the pain symptoms slowly come back, but at least this is something I can buy OTC.",L5-S1 hern/nerve damage
16,Aleve,Back Pain,9,,"November 27, 2015",51,Female 20 years old - I recently started a new job as a cashier. I started to experience pain after having to pick up heavy packs of water bottles and other heavy items. The pain was all in my lower back. I went to visit my chiropractor and that would alleviate the pain until I went back to work. I would rate my pain on a scale from 1 to 10; a 7. It was a sharp stabbing pulling pain in my lower back and it even hurt to take a deep breath. Today was the first day I took Aleve when I went to work and my back pain was almost completely gone. I was able to move around without being uncomfortable. I am extremely satisfied with the results.,Kris1369

18,Aleve,Back Pain,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 2, 2015",65,Male - 33years old. Excruciating pain in lower SI region of my back following an aggressive 30 mile bick ride and a few days of surfing. Woke up the next morning with shooting pain in low back which progressed to shooting pains running down my glutes and referred pain to the hip flexor region. For two weeks this was extremely painful and did not subside even w/ ice applications and finally chiropractic visits 5 total and lots of Advil. Per the suggestion of my wife I tried aleve (2 pills for first dose and 1 pill each dose after that. After 2 pills I noticed a HUGE difference and significantly reduced pain as well as better range of motion as inflammation had gone down. I highly recommend for anyone with back pain as it really helped me!,Nick T

24,Aleve,Back Pain,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 6, 2013",62,"Ibuprofen bothers my stomach so I tried Aleve/naproxen some years back and as to this day it works better then anything else, over the counter, that I have taken. It may not take away all the pain but it takes that evil edge off so the pain becomes less likely to make me vomit. I take Aleve in the morning to prevent the pains and again when I do get the pains.

25,Aleve,Back Pain,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 11, 2012",76,"I bent over and suddenly experienced severe pain.  With either a pinched nerve or a pulled muscle, I could barely make it to a nearby chair.  I took 2 Aleve and applied an ice pack for the entire afternoon.  Within 45 minutes I could slowly walk and I continued to take Aleve as recommended on the bottle.  The next day I resumed my life as usual and in 3 or 4 days I no longer needed Aleve.  Wow, better than a chiropractor.",Agape Light
