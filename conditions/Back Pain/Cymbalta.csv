0,Cymbalta,Back Pain,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 16, 2021",0,"I've suffered from SI pain for years. I've been on 300mg. of Tramadol ( daily), plus regular lower back injections. All of these treatments  have a minimal effect on my pain. My dr. started me on 30mg Cymbalta daily. I'm on day 30. I am experiencing a lot of itching, insomnia, and nausea.  I wish these things would go away, because this medicine combined with the Tramadol is helping the pain. I am now terrified of ever getting off this drug after reading reviews about withdrawal.",Tami
1,Cymbalta,Back Pain,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 29, 2021",1,I have been taking Cymbalta 40 mg/daily since 2013.  I had seen an ad on TV for taking Cymbalta for chronic pain and suggested it to my pain manager and she said why not.  I could have been the poster child for Cymbalta from the very start!  I was completely relieved from the chronic back pain due to degenerative disc disease in my lower back.  I continue to take it today although I have had some problems getting the brand name Rx without a huge copay cost.  Getting a reduction of this huge cost has been extremely difficult ever since the generic came out.  Fortunately my pain manager is very helpful and diligent about getting the cost reduced for me.,Mary

Since I quit I suffer from PSSD, which is persisting Sexual Dysfunction after the use of SSRI or SNRI.I have no libido - I am asexual now. Before I was more on the hypersexual side. My Penis is numb. I cannot feel, when somebody touches it. My penis and testicles shrunk maybe 1/3 to 1/2 in flaccid state. I have severe Erectile Dysfunction. Even Viagra etc is not working. I am 39 and have lost my girlfriend due to this. I have lost my sexuality, my personality, all my hopes for living a normal life. It is the worst that has ever happen to me.

I also experienced lack of appetite for the first couple of weeks and felt very energized.  It faded, but same things when the dose was increased to 60mg.

5,Cymbalta,Back Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 10, 2021",7,This drug should be taken off the market. I have suffered from extreme dehydration. I had to go to the ER. Extreme diarrhea for five hours at a time. My skin felt electric. Blood in diarrhea. I’m weaning off after four weeks and it’s a living nighmare. I feel like the weaning is going to be impossible. Migraines. Shaking and shivering. My doctor never mentioned this to me. Pharmacist never mentioned this. I have quit my job because I cannot work. Everything is aching. I’ve been in bed for two days. Do NOT take this medicine. Read about the life long side effects.,Rayray
6,Cymbalta,Back Pain,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 11, 2021",5,"ZERO STARS ! Twice now have been prescribed this and twice quit it cold turkey. (DO NOT QUIT COLD TURKEY VERY DANGEROUS!) I just did not react well with this medication. It did help a bit with the pain alongside topamax. I just didn't like the fact that you must have this with you at all times and cannot miss a dose. I’m not going to be handcuffed to a medication because if you miss a dose you start horrific withdrawals. Sounds more like a street drug to me ?  Took weeks if not months to get out of my system completely. Never, ever, ever, ever again. I’d rather live with my SI joint dysfunction pain than use this as a bandaid ! I did however finally find a surgeon who specialized in SI joint fusion. No more band aids on a fixable lower back issue ! Please do your research. Effexor is even worse !",Doesn’t matter
7,Cymbalta,Back Pain,1.0,,"November 13, 2020",21,Doc prescribed Cymbalta for nerve pain resembling shingles. Entire right torso front and back feels like I had been drug on asphalt behind a truck! I also have severe diabetic neuropathy in my feet and hands. 1st day on cymbalta I was a little nauseous  with a noticeable headache.  Had trouble sleeping.  I didn't hear alarm so overslept. 2nd day (today) still can't sleep. Even with ambien. No change in pain levels yet. Going to try taking it before bed tonight. Hoping it will work for me. Would like to get off gabapentin.  Taking 2400 mg per day which can't be good for me!Thanks for listening.,Lynn
8,Cymbalta,Back Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 23, 2020",44,"Prescribed for back pain. I was told I have to start with 30mg. and in a week increase it to 60mg.  After two days on Cymbalta, I knew I would never make it.  I got sick almost immediately - stumbling, brain fog, diarrhea, jaw pain, headache, and nausea. I told my doctor I wanted off but she said to take it ""a few weeks"" before I went up to 60mg.  I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt, so I stayed on it for a few more weeks, but didn't get better and it actually got a lot worse.  I called my doctor's office and told her I wanted off. There was no way I was going up to 60mg.  Since I had never increased the dosage,  I immediately went to every other day for a week, then stopped.  The withdrawal was every bit as bad as the reaction to the pill.  There is finally a slight alleviation in the symptoms, so I've decided just to wait it out.  MY RECOMMENDATION:  My experience is this is the worse pill I have ever taken.  Bottom line?  DON'T TAKE THIS PILL!!!!",Mazie
9,Cymbalta,Back Pain,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 25, 2020",53,I had previously got steroid injections for DDD and hip problems all caused from earlier undiagnosed injury as a child. Later in life turned into severe arthritis and facet joint issues. I am only 38 years old. The injections made me feel like a puffer fish and weight ballooned from fluid retention. However it got my inflammation down. So after speaking to my doctor and not wanting to resort to these injections again she tried me on Cymbalta. At first I will say side effects were odd and I felt awful. Helped immediately with weight loss however and after 2 weeks I started to level off and be able to do things I hadn't in almost a year. I literally couldn't bend to pick up my baby. Everyone is different but I have pretty severe back issues daily and for this to be as positive as it was after the first 2 weeks has made a great impact on my life.,Jess

This is the weirdest medicine I've taken.  Taken Fluoxetine for years with no unusual side effects or withdrawals. Reducing because of side effects of night terrors, sweats, etc. It does work for pain but the cost is high.",tessmc57
48,Cymbalta,Back Pain,10.0,,"March 15, 2012",136,"This medication saved my life. I had been suffering from a back injury for years, and the last 4 years were the worst. I've done everything except surgery. I started gaining weight because my back pain limited my daily life.The final straw was after having a child I couldn't walk for 2 months. The amount of narcotics it took for me to even stand was a fight with these doctors. Seems like it's a fight to get help with the pain. I finally asked to try Cymbalta, within 2 days I was taking only a 1/4 of my other medications to help me stand.I've been on it for 8 months, and from the day I gave birth I was 270lbs, I am now at 150, my daughter is only 10 months old.I'm just out of pain and can do things any normal 31yr old can do",ShelbyMx
49,Cymbalta,Back Pain,,,"February 13, 2012",70,"I have had chronic low back pain for over a year now.  The doctor at the pain clinic said, ""Cymbalta is now FDA approved for low back pain.""  It didn't help my pain at all and gave me the worst nausea, no sex drive, insomnia, random sweating, and stiff muscles, this is it!",Anonymous
50,Cymbalta,Back Pain,10.0,,"January 28, 2012",66,"I've been taking Cymbalta (90) for three years because of back pain. I have four fusions in my lower back. I tried to go to 60, because of the unfortunate side effect with orgasm, but upped it back to 90 when my pain level went up. The biggest issue is with feeling dehydrated all the time - very dry mouth, I also seem to take more time to heal and get over respiratory infections.",Roxascat
51,Cymbalta,Back Pain,9.0,,"January 17, 2012",94,"Been on 30mg Cymbalta 1x/day for just a week. Helps a lot with my back pain, almost like its not there and I don't obsess about it constantly. I've had 2 lower back surgeries for herniated disks over the past 15 years. So far a wonder drug with only minimal nausea at first and some fatigue. Never took any other medicines except Aleve in the past, but that just didn't cut it.",pittpete
