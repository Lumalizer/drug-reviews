1,Norco,Back Pain,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 15, 2022",4,"We need to make sure that this message gets out. Share it with as many people as you know: People are being forced to buy drugs on the street, stronger, non-regulated, and often deadly alternatives to their pain medications, because of the re formulations that have taken place in the commonly prescribed hydrocodone formula. I have been a pain patient and practitioner for over 25 years. Norco is an easy medication to prescribe - while addictive in nature, if taken as prescribed, the risks are fairly mitigated.People are dying because they cannot get access to a low risk medication that works. SHARE THIS MESSAGE. It feels like no one is hearing us!!! Due to pressure, lawsuits, and the like, the reformulated generic Norcos are very unpleasant. The active ingredient is the same, but it isn't derived the same way. Much of it is derived abroad. Qualitest/Par/Endo formulated the yellow ones that the pain patients here refer to. It worked well and didn't create the side effects of the others.",Michael Wilsher

I take it as prescribed and it worked to keep me functioning adequately.  Now that they're pharmacies are getting their hydrocodone from the manufacturers listed in these comments I get no relief. My last prescription I took my pills with food and immediately threw my food up. It's not right to not have a choice to get American Pharmaceutical FDA inspected medications.

4,Norco,Back Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2022",6,"I filled a small script at Walmart for hydrocodone/acetaminophen5 - 325 When away from home. Not my normal pharmacy.

Otherwise I cannot sit still from nerve pain and jumping in the nerves. I am 62 years old, and healthy.I couldn't understand why I got no pain relief when taking the script from Walmart until I started reading this forum.I did NOT KNOW it was a different brand than my pharmacy so it's NOT ALL IN MY HEAD. This brand of Hydrocodone does NOT work.I tried it 4 x And I got zero pain relief.Had 4 sleepless nights.Finally got my normal script from my pharmacy.

5,Norco,Back Pain,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 29, 2021",13,"This is a follow up of a review about a year ago. The Mallinckrodt brand has gotten even weaker to the point where I have decided to stop taking them. They are starting to give me a NERVOUS TYPE of SICK FEELING on top of the daily pain. I will also stop making all my supplemental health insurance payments and work on a plan to become an expat of U.S. It is a shame I have to make plans to leave after building USA infrastructure for close to 40 years of heavy construction work. The daily, close to 40 years use of heavy construction tools that caused vibration throughout the body created multiple levels from neck to lumber of herniations and stenosis. The medications do not work anymore for reasons only FDA and CDC can explain. I pray for an advocate to start legal action to see why the medications don't work anymore.",GandyDancer

My pharmacist informed me I wasn’t the only patient stating this, in fact about  20 patients said the same thing. I had to switch pharmacies at the advice of my pharmacist. I now am running into the same issue now at my new pharmacy. I believe they are removing the hydrocodone from our medications.

Its worthless. WALGREENS uses Mallinckrodt which is worthless.  The best effectiveness I've had is from Watson . I've requested the Watson brand from all major pharmacies.  They can get it, but the insurance won't cover it.  The only bad thing about the less expensive Norco I've experienced is shortness of breath and the panic it causes.",Johnny Reb
12,Norco,Back Pain,4.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 24, 2021",9,I do think it was some TV reporter a few years ago that exposed the research done by some pharmaceuticals that found a way to reduce the instant high affects with opioids that caused these continuous deadly overdoses by changing the content of the pill so that it didn't cause quick highs. If I remember correctly the FDA was requested by the govt. to do this research.  Chewing the older pills or absorbing them in the mouth rather than swallowing them brought about that instant high. The downside is that the patients on the study reported less effectiveness of the new pills for actually controlling pain due to reduced absorption.  I agree with all of the reviews stating their experiences with reduced benefits and especially the mallinckrodt.  I too have different worse or less side affects with all the generics out there.,Screaminouch!
13,Norco,Back Pain,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 22, 2021",11,"Short but to the point, I agree with almost all of these posts. Broke my back in 1993 have taken every pain medication on the market (back when doctors were able to help their patients). After my 4th surgery doctors say that was all they could do for me and I would be on pain management the rest of my life. Well like most all I too have seen a drop in pain relief from generic Norco, been taking these since 2004 and used to work just fine , nothing gets rid of all the pain, but helps have a life so to speak. The past couple years I have not only experienced lack of pain control, but hives from some manufacture (Eywa Pharmaceutical, blue pill purchased from Winn Dixie being the cheapest), (along with stomach problems with Amnell) and of course (Mallinckrodt severe lack of pain management) but stuck as more and more companies are being forced out of the market.",RedFred

However, I always had a problem getting refill and he always gave me the DEA story of how he didn't want to write the script. I finally went to a Pain Management clinic. Worse mistake I ever made! The pain management doctor treated me like an addict. I have never misused my pain medication. I got so frustrated that I stopped taking them. I have not had a good day since. And of course the pain management clinic won't return my calls. It's very sad that because some people have misused this medication and the government has stuck their hands in the doctor's office that people with legitimate pain has to suffer.",Bwayne66

Lately I’ve been helping my son and daughter-in-law babysitting my 3 grandsons which is not easy. As most the manufacturer is Mallincrkrodt. The script I just had filled is way different! The pain doesn’t subside and I literally feel very sick! While I normally feel pain relief and also more alert I now feel I can’t stay awake and honestly feel horrible! I’ve called all pharmacies and they all use nothing but Mallinckrodt!  Also none of them have name brand Norco anymore!When I was getting Norco when colored yellow that worked the best.

First visit the Dr came in said I read your chart you’ve had everything done to try and help your pain, so why are you here. I explained, I’m here because of a pharmacist,  I explained he was shocked a pharmacist could do this and with all my surgeries. A pharmacist would complain about four pain pills a day. Dr wrote my RX added do not fill with Mallinckrodt, Aurobindo or Amneal . 2 years no problems last few months CVS said No Sun REALLY !!

I used to take generic Watson never had an issue but when most pharmacy switched to that Mallinckrodt manufacturer I had to quit taking due to severe allergic reactions.  So, after reading these comments I see I'm not the only one, now I don't know where to get meds refilled,  pharmacies are doing something different for sure,  these pills look the same but something is off, and they thought people would not notice, well I did right off the bat.

24,Norco,Back Pain,8.0,,"February 18, 2021",9,I actually respond well to Mallinckrodt M366 acetaminophen & hydrocodone for 2 years. Walmart switched to Camber T258 which are useless even at a higher dose and impair sleep where M366 actually improved sleep if taken at the right time.

30,Norco,Back Pain,9.0,,"September 12, 2020",92,"For years I took brand Norco (acetaminophen/hydrocodone) when it was manufactured by Watson.  When the drug went off patent, many companies jumped in to manufacture generic versions of the drug.  At one time, Watson was manufacturing a generic, which was great, since it was exactly the same as the brand, but Watson was bought out, and it's impossible to know (except through trial and error) whether the purchaser is using the Watson ""recipe.""  As for generics acetaminophen with hydrocodone, for me, the generic Norco manufactured by Aurobindo has been excellent, as has that manufactured by Mallinckrodt and Rhodes.  I have also been able to take the generic manufactured by Tris with what is usually adequate pain relief (but not as good as Aurobindo, Mallinckrodt or Rhodes).  The generic that I absolutely cannot take is Amneal - it's like not taking anything at all.  I'm not sure why, as all of these drugs should have the same amount of opiate in them, but I might as well not fill the prescription if the generic is Amneal.",JP

33,Norco,Back Pain,3.0,,"May 10, 2020",386,"2 years agoI went to Walgreens instead of CVS and got my prescription filled  that month for Norco 10 / 325 it was a pill look like my yellow ones little football but it was white. Absolutely  did not work. I'm 67 years old and I had a horrible car accident 23 years ago and with the help of Norco I live with the pain. The last few years they're screwing with the medicine - everybody - not just Walgreens, Walgreens is the worst by the way. I believe that they are no longer putting opiate in their pills I mean if you get a 10 / 325 you shouldn't be able to break it so easily, used to be so hard to break that little yellow pill in half. I mean a lot of us are in pain if you're in pain why should we have to live in pain I don't get it.

( THOSE ARE AWFUL) however Mallinckrodt is the best I can come up with because Watson no longer makes this medication and the looks from the pharmacy just because it doesn't look like I have anything wrong doesn't mean that there isn't. My doctor has shared with me that he won't increase my dosage even though my condition is chronic nor will he change it to Percocet because I would have to go to a hearing I don't know if anyone has ever heard of any of these things but if you have please share I'm in Ohio the Cleveland area.

Pain management cut me down to four 10/325. Work went OK...(only 7 hour days)...then pain management cut me down again..(against my will )...down to four   7.5/325, then down to three 7.5/325 a day.

I was trying Zohydro 30mgs...but with 60 mgs I STILL needed 30 more mgs of another medication.

I’ve taken Norco off and on and it does help with the pain but it just doesn’t last long and I need a high dose that makes me sleepy. My big complaint is the restrictions on opioids.

I gave up & she suggested 1 last med Norco. I was skeptical & given in to the pain but took just one pill & after 1 hour, I had no pain for hours! I’ve had excruciating pain for so long, it honestly feels strange not to have it a few hours a day now. Another plus is NO SIDE EFFECTS like others (dizziness, out of it feeling (I guess euphoria which I hate), no constipation) and it just works!

I called around and Par told me you are with AmerisourceBergen and that you can order par. The 24 hour locations can try but they are mostly stocked fully with Mallinckrodt and can’t order past a certain threshold. Call the locations that are open to 9pm. BOTH of the non 24 hour Walgreens were able to go in their system pull up Par yellow norco and order them. They also notated my file that I have a bad reaction on Mallinkcrodt and can only be filled actavis (which is still made I called them as well) or Par. Hope this helps.,Jazz

I've taken it for 4 years and have had times off of the medication and it's tough but only because the pain returns and I become sleep deprived. It really is a miracle.",Anonymous

I just want to have a normal day to get up and care for my family. I don't drink or abuse medicines but I'm thankful for what relief I get from my medicines.",Mrs. Lissa
112,Norco,Back Pain,10.0,,"October 8, 2011",52,"As a former Firefighter who suffered a back injury 17 yrs ago. The surgeons said surgery would not help and that I should stay on pain medicines for relief. I've tried them all. Norco 10/325 has been the best. I have been able to get a job and hold it, which has done wonders for my self esteem. To be able to return to the work force and lead a relatively normal life. I can't do a lot of things but since being on Norco 10/325 for 4 years now I no longer suffer any depression and family and friends say I'm my old self again. I still suffer times where I have to slow way down but overall this medicine has been life changing for me.",DragnSlyr

115,Norco,Back Pain,9.0,,"September 15, 2011",37,"I am a female, 20 years old and have been on Vicodin since I was 17 years old. I had an accident in '07 and had major health issues and found that I have Scleroderma (a hardening of the skin and tissues) and it had caused me to have mild arthritis through my body. This year I found out I have full nerve damage in my left leg and it's completely numb. This is caused from an 8mm herniated disc in my L4. My doctor bumped me up to Norco and I must say it does work. At most I take 2 every 5 hours. But normally 1 and a half does the trick. Withdrawals are bad, BAD anxiety, depression (coming off and being on), also decreased sex drive and libido. But does work wonders for pain. ",ACLHERXIISS
116,Norco,Back Pain,10.0,,"September 6, 2011",12,Norco has been extremely useful in helping relieve my lower back pain. Now my doctor is switching me to Ultram though so we'll see how they compare in effectiveness.,Anonymous
117,Norco,Back Pain,9.0,,"August 13, 2011",37,"I had a traumatic injury to my neck and shoulders about 7 years ago and didn't have proper treatment to repair the injury, so now I have constant moderate-to-severe pain in my neck/shoulder/back. Norcos really help a lot, but, as others have said, they don't last very long. I have to take 1.5-2 10/325mg tablets every 4 hours (at the most). WORST SIDE EFFECT: Constipation. By far. Since my back hurts all the time, the thought of going and playing sports is intimidating to say the least, so I don't exercise nearly as much as I should (I've gained 35 pounds since the accident and I'm 28 now). Overall this is a great medicine and one I would recommend.",MateoKC

My back is a mess. I have had multiple surgeries for stenosis and disk problems. I have tried all the pain killers, Oxycontin, MS morphine, Lortab, etc. Norco works the best and I have only minimal side effects. I have taken the Norco 10's, one every 4-6 hours for the past 5 years. I am able to work and function almost normally with the pain killers.",Okiebiker
