1,Nabumetone,Back Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 25, 2021",5,"I was just diagnoses with psoriatic arthritis. Normally I have neck, back, hands and foot pain. Some swelling in my fingers. Also have had blurred vision and a cough due to the inflammation. Was prescribed Nabumotone 750mg. First time I took it I was very drowsy and felt sort of rubbery as opposed to the stiffness I normally feel. On my second day my pain is less in my back, neck and hands, still there but less. Not drowsy. My cough and eyes are better. After only taking it two days I can see improvement.",JayRay
2,Nabumetone,Back Pain,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 21, 2020",15,"Helped some for my back pain, but the side effects far outweighed the benefit which was just slightly better than regular old ibuprofen.  It totally changed my personality, made me irritable, and just put me in an overall bad mood.  I was also very confused and tired on this medication.  And on top of all that, it made my stomach hurt and began giving me headaches.  I stopped taking it.",Shank

But it is apparently not like mine. I have noticed NO relief whatsoever! I'm taking 500mg bid. Why not just take 800mg of ibuprofen?",Thom the painter
10,Nabumetone,Back Pain,10.0,,"November 11, 2017",17,Degenerated Disc in neck was replaced with a pig bone substitute about 15 years ago.  Waited too long to have surgery so I have some spinal cord nerve damage which periodically gives me a sharp pain (count of 10-11 range on a 1-10 scale) over my left eye.  Severe enough to make me stop whatever I'm doing including get off the highway if I'm driving.  Take one pill and 10-15 minutes later it's gone!  I usually take a second pill 10-12 hours later.  I some times take one if I've abused my neck more than normal also.   No side effects and it works every time!,NightScannner
11,Nabumetone,Back Pain,1.0,,"October 17, 2017",20,"Worthless! May as well take a dose of sugar. Took low dose lortab for years off and on for back pain, but the political pressure on doctors is too much for them to bear. The CDC tells them what to prescribe now. Criminals!!!",Dougnwv

MD stopped opioids pain meds and we are trying different types of pain management.  Allergic reaction to Lyrica and Meloxicam didn't do a darn thing.  Relafen didn't work at first but now?  It's a life saver. I do also take protonix due to terrible upset stomach issues from taking Ibuprofin for many months.  It's a life changer for me!  I am only 43 and feel very thankful to have this med!",AHL

15,Nabumetone,Back Pain,1.0,,"November 30, 2016",19,"Actually seemed to make my spasmed muscle in the shoulder blade area worse. It got better almost immediately after I stopped. I know this makes no sense. Tried it again after a couple of weeks with a flair up and it immediately got worse again. I don't understand why, but definitely didn't work for me plus during the second use I developed a rash. Not for me, too bad",Rebecca Oakland
16,Nabumetone,Back Pain,3.0,,"July 5, 2016",14,"I have tried this drug once, it did help out my back pain greatly, but it has me the worst nausea ever. After about an hour or relaxation, all went to hell and I thought I was going to throw up right there and then. I didn't thankfully but I had those feelings off and on for another 2 hours and after that the drug had worn off. I don't think the hour of relaxation was worth the horrible nasuea.",Tyler3842

I found a specialist when I start having pain in my lower back and sharp pain in my leg.  My doctor put me on Relafen taking 2 pills a day.  My symptoms were well managed by this medicine.  I had no side effects and I was able to function quiet well. I think this medicine is a very good one for the type of pain I have for my back and pain down my thigh. I really recommend this to anyone with back or leg pain or arthritis in the back. It really works.",Weej

I dislike taking opiates but found myself taking way too high of a dose of Ibuprofen on a regular basis and found it no longer working effectively.  Relafen works great.  I do get a slight bit of initial dizziness for about 20 minutes after I take it and I'm a bit drowsier than normal but the pain relief is well worth it.  I sleep great at night, no more waking up or tossing and turning.",Anonymous

About a month ago, my Doctor switched me off of Naproxen and onto this drug. It seems to be a little more effective and I am only taking it twice a day.
