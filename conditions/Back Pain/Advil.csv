0,Advil,Back Pain,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 22, 2020",4,"The new ad with the catchy songwe want to praise you for your strength seems to empower you with the thought that you keep strong through all your pain and maybe Advil helps this too. It does, it did for me. I took two in the AM and two in the pm for 3-4 years and kept doing anything physical I wanted to- until I was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease CKD. I only have 30% kidney function and I am not able to take any NSAIDs any more. I can only take acetaminophen and I am in constant pain because acetaminophen does not reduce inflammation like Advil does. BE CAREFUL the ads say  what pain?  well when your kidneys won't function properly you will learn what pain is when you canâ€™t take Advil anymore because you took it for too long and then a Dr says would you like me to prescribe an opioid for you pain now? No thank you. Read The Label!!!",Chris
1,Advil,Back Pain,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 17, 2017",16,"I bought the New Advil minis and they stink, They did nothing for my back pain as the originals did. I took 2 gels at once and they usually work right away, but these minis did nothing. I don't believe there is 200mg in each one as they say. Why change something that works, they lost my business..I hope others test it and let everyone know if they worked for them.",Roeb
2,Advil,Back Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 4, 2015",15,"Awful, to say the least. Don't even consider this if you have anything more than a headache, and even that won't be tolerable after taking a few of these.",L5-S1 hern/nerve damage
3,Advil,Back Pain,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 23, 2015",15,"This works very well for me, and needless to say is readily available.  The trick is knowing when to take one or when to take two.",Marcus99
