0,Ultram,Back Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2022",0,"I have severe scoliosis implant in back, degenerative discs in upper middle and lower back. I have been taking Ultram 50 mg. for a couple days and this stuff doesn't work.  I am having more pain as my upper back is in a lot more pain and just as much in the rest of my back. I will not take anymore.  What a ripoff! I give this medicine a 0!",mike
1,Ultram,Back Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 6, 2021",1,"Ultram is totally different from the generic tramadol. Much, much better. I had to switch as it was giving me headaches. I to take more than 2x the tramadol than what I take of ultram",Dakota
2,Ultram,Back Pain,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 16, 2018",59,"After car accident, back surgery, I have failed back syndrome, severe sciatica, neuropathy soles of feet, meragia (thighs numbness or pain in the outer thigh due to pinched or compressed nerve),  I have used Ultram since 1998.   First I used it just when required and slowly increased to 2- 3 day and it gives me life.  I can keep my pain level at an endurable level and still teach classes, volunteer with seniors, drive car unimpaired.  It is important for  me. NSAIDs ate my stomach lining away. Tylenol causes heart palpitations.  Some patients need this med to keep doing things and not encumbered with horrible sciatica and chronic pain, debilitating neuropathy. No cure for these conditions so must treat!",Juju
3,Ultram,Back Pain,,,"February 14, 2018",14,My sister was prescribed this medicine and has become addicted to opioids. Tread very lightly if you plan to take this drug. I would advise not going near it. ,pegasaurus
4,Ultram,Back Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 5, 2016",84,I told my physician that I would no longer take Percocet for my chronic back pain. He suggested I try tramadol and assured me it is not a narcotic. I have been talking the tramadol now for a year and although it is no miracle drug it has managed my pain immensely. I can finally sleep at night and function normally. One down side to the drug for me is if I run out and the withdraw starts it is nasty. Be careful you stop the drug abruptly. Good health to all.

5,Ultram,Back Pain,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 6, 2014",97,I've been on tramidol for 5 years and I have 3 crushed vertebra' s and it works great when I comes to relaxing me enough to get out and do things I normally can't do without them....,gundy
6,Ultram,Back Pain,10.0,,"September 17, 2014",96,"Around the same time this year I have had a baby and shoulder surgery for osteoarthritis. Hence, I suffered from both shoulder pain AND post-partum depression. Percocet didn't stop the pain and Zoloft made me feel worse. My doctor prescribed Ultram and it is now my miracle pill! It helps with both issues. It allows me to be a normal functioning mom. I love how it helps my mood and physical pain!",Newmom84
7,Ultram,Back Pain,10.0,,"August 8, 2014",122,"I have had a degenerative disk for almost 10 years, and have taken Ultram for the past year and a half. For almost 8 years, due to no insurance, I took nothing and lived with the pain. No narcotic such as hydrocodone has ever touched the pain, but Ultram completely eradicates the pain! It helps my mood and I'm able to work long hours with no pain. As of July 1, 2014 it is a schedule 4 narcotic and now I'm unsure whether I'll be able to get the dosage I need.",shepppy

9,Ultram,Back Pain,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 2, 2014",84,"Started taking for back pain took two doses and ended up in hospital with halucinations, dizziness, and feeling faint.

11,Ultram,Back Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 12, 2013",184,I took two tramadol and had the best night's sleep for longer than I can remember.  I have chronic back pain I got from from when I was younger where I was in a tournament fight. I am 40 now with a kid and working 50 plus hours per week (mostly sitting down). I have taken everything and been in physical therapy and nothing seems to work.  I hate being in a fog of the other narcotics. I want to enjoy my life and my family not be oblivious to it.  This is amazing. I don't want side effects so I'll keep it to a minimum.,SFOG
12,Ultram,Back Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 5, 2013",123,I have found that this medication not only relieves my chronic pain but I am able to take it and still work- I could not do that with the standard narcotic pain relievers which are typically prescribed. Thanks to my doctor's recommendation of this medicine I am able to live a much less painful and much more fulfilling life.,J Nic
13,Ultram,Back Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 28, 2012",181,I have been on Ultram for a few years now I had a spinal fusion and they put me on Ultram 50 mg for pain every 4 hours and I must say it helps me tremendously! Even more then Percocet or Vicodin so I would highly recommend this medication for back pain.,jenn8701
14,Ultram,Back Pain,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 20, 2012",100,"I have a degenerated disc and arthritis in my back. At first the pain was intense and I couldn't sleep. My doctor prescribed Vicodin but that made me feel drunk and couldn't function. I take Ultram 50mgs every 4 hours. At first I took them only when I was in pain. But realized through articles that taking it when pain starts it's not as effective! I now sleep pretty good, before I couldn't sleep and I was like a zombie! Little side effects. After 4 hours I get a little air headed. Been on it about a month! Trying to determine if I as I have been taking it every 4hrs pain or not. I'm pleased that I have a lot less pain and can function!",Drgrandps
15,Ultram,Back Pain,9.0,,"April 17, 2012",110,"I have osteoarthritis, bursitis in my shoulder, degenerative discs, and have had surgery for a herniated disc. I have been on hydrocodone and Percocet, but Ultram 100 mg by far does a better job keeping me comfortable and able to function without feeling cloudy.",kjp
16,Ultram,Back Pain,9.0,,"February 27, 2012",115,"I have 4 herniated discs (C1/C2 & L4/L5), Fibromyalgia, and Migraine Headaches. I also have  Atrial Tachycardia, which basically means that my heart beats at extremely fast irregular rates, and the surgery that fixes 95% of these cases won't work on me.       My Doctor put me on Ultram 60mg 3 times daily and Morphine Sulphate Extended Release 50mg recently. I have to admit, at first I wasn't thrilled about the Ultrams. I'd taken them in lower doses before and told my wife I'd be better off on Tylenol. But I gave them a shot and to my surprise the pain relief was amazing! I love Ultram because I don't live in ""FOG"" all the time. I can drive, go to work, play with my Baby and spend time with my family. I would recommend Ultram!",nyte_trane_25
17,Ultram,Back Pain,10.0,,"October 24, 2011",95,"It works better than any narcotic for my neck/back pain, without the side effects of narcotics, such as nausea and tiredness.",Anonymous
18,Ultram,Back Pain,9.0,,"April 13, 2011",101,I'm only 26 years old and have been suffering from chronic back pain for 6 years (due to a fall). I haven't gotten much help from all the doctors I've had. They all treated me like an addict because I'm so young. Anyway my new doctor has given 50mg of Ultram but only 15 day supply. I wish I could have it everyday but the risk of addiction is not worth it. I'm am super grateful I get 15 days of relief a month. It has helped me be my happy go lucky self. I recommend it.,Beatrix kiddo

20,Ultram,Back Pain,4.0,,"January 28, 2011",61,"I have been using Tramadol for back pain due to spinal fusion. I found that when I am on a higher dose, I feel OK but once I am under 200 mg a day, it doesn't work for me. Unfortunately, this medicine has to be weened from so I have to go through the lower dosages to be able to try another medicine.",Anonymous

22,Ultram,Back Pain,8.0,,"January 8, 2011",155,"Good at relieving pain for a short duration (4 hours at a time) with few side effects. I found that at 200mg/day my pain was cut in half and I had increased energy and a brighter mood.  I have used this medicine for 4 years now and find that it is very effective for about four months.. and then effectiveness decreases.  At that point, my doctor switches me to a narcotic for three to four weeks and then I can continue with the tramadol over again with a ""reset"" in the effectiveness factor.  The strongest negative for me is getting off the tramadol... withdrawl effects include major mood swings, insomnia, and dizziness.  But overall, it is quite effective and has very few bad effects for me while taking it.",Runosai
