0,Ketoprofen,Back Pain,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2020",4,"I""ve been taking OTC ibuprofen for my back pain and cramps for days but pain became severe which leads me to hospitalization. The pain intensify like I'm giving birth so ibuprofen has no effect on me at all, it doesn't even cured my migraine.  The doctor prescribed me ketoprofen  and it is very fast acting, so magical that the pain I'm enduring for days just gone in about 30 mins and Ive been recommending it with my friends and families who had muscle inflammation, arthritis and so on.. really thumbs up!",Gha
