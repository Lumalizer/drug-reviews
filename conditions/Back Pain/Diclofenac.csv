0,Diclofenac,Back Pain,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 11, 2022",10,"Voltaren (diclofenac):I've had severe unrelenting L4-5 radiating pain, searing sciatica, and overall spine fatigue.I  am only 56 years old and normal BMI so I'm not sure why I've even got so many spine issues that are unrelieved by therapy or posture improvement. That aside, my dr rx'd me voltaren pills..and honestly, the side effects were scary. Then I saw a gel available. I turned around went back to my drs room and asked about the gel, his nurse said she had a sample + $5 off coupon. I've used the gel for 2 days and I already feel noticeably less pain. I'm a little concerned that all the American articles say to not use it on your back, but Australian and New Zealand articles seem to use the emulgel voltaren which looks to be the about the same thing to me. Mine has 1% active ingredient and I think the emulgel . I will ask my doctor when I see him in a month.but so far I would say it is definitely a noticeable difference even after one day.. of course if I develop a side effect I will update this review.",Ambrid
1,Diclofenac,Back Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 18, 2022",3,Voltaren (diclofenac):I just started getting terrible back pain. Went to the doc and realized that I have arthritis.

2,Diclofenac,Back Pain,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 31, 2021",1,Voltaren (diclofenac):Voltarten works 100% on Back pain that comes from Fibromyalgia. I’ve suffered for years with horrible lower back pain from Fibromyalgia muscle pain. I first use Real Time a muscle ache creme. I rub that first which opens the pores with Menthol then I apply the Voltaren and almost immediately I get relief. I’ve tried about everything over the counter and prescription and either I had reactions or no relief. This combination works 100% without burning my skin or other reactions. This along with my prescription Hydrocodone works totally. I also use both in other areas of pain and it works. It keeps me totally out of pain during the day and also at bedtime so I can get a good nights sleep.,Dave

6,Diclofenac,Back Pain,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 11, 2021",26,"I am a 49 year old woman with cervical stenosis/myelopathy due to impingement from disc degeneration and bone spurs. Also severe pain from cervical radiculopathy down my right arm. During a terrible flareup six weeks ago with unbearable pain, I began taking 50mg diclofenac three times a day plus paracetamol (acetaminophen), with diazepam and codeine at night when the spasms were bad. Over time, I've achieved pain relief from the diclofenac and have been able to drop the paracetemol, diazepam and codeine. The pain isn't gone completely but I can work, sleep, etc. Anytime I forget to take it, or try stepping down to ibuprofen instead, the pain comes back viciously within hours! So I know it's doing its job. I've had minimal side effects (some constipation). You do need to take it with meals. I understand it's not intended for longterm use, but hoping it will see me through to surgery next year. I'm very grateful for it!",Jane

I was prescribed Diclofenac by my doctor which did nothing. There was no change of any kind to my pain and in the middle of the night I was actually sobbing. For 3 days prior to this prescription I had taken neurophen which did provide some relief and I took 5 mg valium tablets, 1/2 a tablet at night with the neurophen which enabled me to sleep. After seeing my doctor ,she prescribed me ten tablets of low dose valium to take with the Diclofenic  causing me to feel drowsy but leaving me with mind-blowing pain.

Now, earlier today, I had an awful pinched nerve in my back (probably due to wallpapering yesterday), and I put a Diclofenac patch over the nerve pain area and it has taken all of the nerve pain away. The patches are absolutely wonderful for local pain, and especially for people like me whose stomachs can't handle meds like ibuprofen very well. I did try the Diclofenac tablets once years ago, but they really bothered my stomach, so I won't take those again. However, the patches are an absolute god-send whenever I have localized inflammation / muscle pain or nerve pain, as was the case today.",C8

After struggling with injections, pain killers, muscle relaxants, physical therapy, chiropractic, and acupuncture.... 50 mg diclofenac 1 to 3 times a day for 1 week took out the stiffness and pain in my back completely.Almost equally as good as steroid injections.I have lower facet joint syndrome, spondylothesis, and some sciatica.I really wish it had a better side effect profile particularly on the arterial changes it can make increasing risk for heart attack and stroke!!!I've taken 1000mg of Naproxen for weeks with no noticeable difference, though it's safer side effect wise.I plan on using the quick release and or the time release diclofenac to calm down intense flareups without staying on it for long periods of time.It's too bad, the pain relief is better than percocet, which you have to be a criminal to get anymore !!!

Then  my mobility scooter got stuck in reverse and I went flying backwards down the hill, dumped me in the woodpile, battery flew off and hit me in the back. I was off the diclofenac for the surgery. In the ER room they put me on pain meds they were not working so I went back on the diclofenac. It works very well, I have weight gain, pain in arms at night and diarrhea and I sleep more than I used to. But the pain of bone on bone is way more than I can stand. I'm sold on the diclofenac.

Don't expect miracles. You should not be expecting this gel to completely alleviate back pain. It's not supposed to do that. It's supposed to get your muscles to a place where you can do other things more easily to attain painlessness via a combined effort. For a lot of back pain, if you use the gel in conjunction with consistent stretching (twice daily) whilst consuming the correct diet and being active enough to lower your body weight, you will be in a much better place in no time - so be encouraged!
