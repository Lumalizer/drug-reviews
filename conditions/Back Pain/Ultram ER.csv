0,Ultram ER,Back Pain,7,,"November 19, 2011",16,"2005 started taking tramadol 50mg, and the within a few months started on 100mg time release. These past few months I feel the medication hasn't helped like in the beginning. Sciatica pain 24/7, Thursday had another round of epidural, and doctor wants me off tramadol. Well tonight I've had such bad anxiety I can't sleep.  I thought he would ween me off this medicine, like all other medicine in this category! Will call the doctors office Monday, this is ridiculous to be miserable at night, due to the doctors advise.  I'm tempted to just take a pill just to get some sleep, I have a little tingly on the right leg, but not in any pain.  Hope this epidural works this time.  Back in 2006 it did not help. ",monakona
1,Ultram ER,Back Pain,10,,"May 30, 2011",110,"Been on it for three day, and feel like myself again. Decompression, fusion, injection therapy, muscle relaxers, opiates, nerve blockers, NSAIDs. Nothing has given me long term relief the way Ultram ER has. Aside from the dependence issues, I think I found my wonder drug. I have degenerative disk disease and spinal stenosis.",Jkish1232000
2,Ultram ER,Back Pain,8,,"April 1, 2011",32,I had scoliosis surgery about 30 yrs ago. Was in an auto accident herniated cervical and lumbar discs. Now fused T1-S1. Lumbar fusion resulted in nerve damage with pain radiating through right leg to my toes. Lyrica and Neurontin didn't help. Tramadol worked wonders. I take 2-50mg tabs and they get me moving. But they keep me up at  night the pain keeps me up all night too so I take temazepam for sleep. Now I'm trying the extended release version at night hoping the lag time until they start working will allow me some sleep and I'll feel better when I wake up.,Scoliosis girl
