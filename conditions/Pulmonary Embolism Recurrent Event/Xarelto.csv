0,Xarelto,Pulmonary Embolism Recurrent Event,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 2, 2019",18,I had multiple pulmonary embolisms a month ago and are using Xarelto 15mg in the morning and 15mg at night. I am very happy with it compared to warfarin I used 15 years ago for a DVT.  The only complaint I have is that I feel tired an exhausted most of the time.  My hair loss is less than with warfarin.  I hope these side effects diminish because I have to be on blood thinners for life.,Tess
1,Xarelto,Pulmonary Embolism Recurrent Event,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 21, 2018",11,"Developed multiple PEs as a side effect of the oral contraceptive pill - after discharge, I took Innohep with Xarelto for 2 weeks, then Xarelto alone for 6 months. Taking Xarelto instead of warfarin stopped me from becoming even more of a pincushion from needles and prevented frequent hospital visits. I experienced next to no side effects, aside from feeling cold and dizzy occasionally. I was lucky with my government's healthcare as they covered virtually the entire cost, but it would have been very expensive otherwise (about â‚¬300 a month).",Jo
2,Xarelto,Pulmonary Embolism Recurrent Event,8,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 3, 2017",19,"Xa inhibitors such as Xarelto are increasingly becoming more commonly prescribed and very effective in treating Antiphospholipid syndrome (an autoimmune disorder that causes 'sticky blood' resulting in clots) as an alternative to Warfarin, particularly in the cases of patients such as myself who had unstable INR results. The side effects have been minimal, and possibly can't all necessarily be blamed on Xarelto as I take many other medications, some with similar side effects such as tiredness and headaches. The worst side effect for me is dizziness, but my specialist recommended I take it just before bed instead of the morning as the dizziness wears off within several hours.",fizzypop
3,Xarelto,Pulmonary Embolism Recurrent Event,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 10, 2017",23,"Developed a serious DVT blood clot in the arm that broke loose into a small PE in my left lung.  I spent 3 months on Xarelto (3 weeks at 15 mg/twice a day and then 20 mg/once a day).  Completely recovered from PE and arm clot during that time and felt great (no side effects from Xarelto at all!).  3 weeks after quitting Xarelto, I developed a massive bi-lateral PE and found out I have Anti-Phospholipid Syndrome.  I'm now back on Xarelto (and will be on thinners for life) for a little over a month.  The PE has cleared up and I've returned to hiking.  No side effects/symptoms at all from the Xarelto.  Despite a few bumps and scrapes while hiking, I don't even have abnormal bleeding/bruising!  I'm guessing this is due to it's short half life.",48 yr old Male
