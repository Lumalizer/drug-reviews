0,Coumadin,Pulmonary Embolism Recurrent Event,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 11, 2020",1,"I've been taking Coumadin for about 20 years. I have many times gone too long without going for my blood work, but I work a lot of hours. The only occasional side affect is a bad headache. I went to one of the top hematologists in our area and was told if I tolerate it well that I shouldn't switch. My internist has been trying for years to switch me to a 'equivalent' that doesn't need the maintenance but if I don't have any problems with it I am going to stick with it I am. It has saved my life for a long time, between having DVT's and PE's. Apparently, a congenital problem according to the experts.",Pug
