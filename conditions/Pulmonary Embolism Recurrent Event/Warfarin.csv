0,Warfarin,Pulmonary Embolism Recurrent Event,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 11, 2020",1,"Coumadin (warfarin):I've been taking Coumadin for about 20 years. I have many times gone too long without going for my blood work, but I work a lot of hours. The only occasional side affect is a bad headache. I went to one of the top hematologists in our area and was told if I tolerate it well that I shouldn't switch. My internist has been trying for years to switch me to a 'equivalent' that doesn't need the maintenance but if I don't have any problems with it I am going to stick with it I am. It has saved my life for a long time, between having DVT's and PE's. Apparently, a congenital problem according to the experts.",Pug

I've been on Warfarin 5mg since Mar 2012, prior to that I had a blood clot in one lung back in 2007 following surgery. My experience has been devastating like a walking Time Boom.

Just  have to be extra careful on any other meds my Doctor puts me on.",teeia50
2,Warfarin,Pulmonary Embolism Recurrent Event,8,,"May 6, 2012",19,I was 39 years old at my first clot after surgery. I went off Coumadin after a year. Then had a pulmonary embolism and was put back on Coumadin.  My INRs had great fluctuations. I now have my own home Coagucheck and adjust my Coumadin with a Dr's supervision and no clot since. I have had side effects but no clots since then.,janny age 56.
3,Warfarin,Pulmonary Embolism Recurrent Event,8,,"May 17, 2010",35,"I was first diagnosed with Pulmonary Embolism in 9/2007 and was on Warfarin for 3-6 months. Over the next 2-3 years I would get blood clots in the legs but never too serious again. Then in Late March 2010 Guess what was back, you guessed it Pulmonary Embolism.  I was told this time that I would have to take this medicine for the rest of my life. I am only 39 years old and I feel so helpless that I have this happen to me.  But I am alive and I will do what I need to do to stay that way....Please don't ignore the symptoms.",DVT/Pulmonary Kid
