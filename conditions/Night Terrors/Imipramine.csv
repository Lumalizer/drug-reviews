0,Imipramine,Night Terrors,10,,"January 2, 2010",72,"Tofranil (imipramine):I had panic attacks (Night Terrors) for over a year or more and had lost hope for  medication to help. Since the first night of taking Tofranil, I slept normal without the 3-4 am wake up(night terror) and have been free of them for 12 years without changing my medication. I am so thankful to have finely found and inexpensive medicine that actually worked from the first dose.",XXXXXXXXXX
1,Imipramine,Night Terrors,9,,"January 8, 2009",30,"I take Imipramine for Cataplexy and Night Terrors.  For cataplexy, Imipramine is by far the most effective treatment my doctor has tried, as it has eliminated about 70% of the attacks.  As for night terrors, they are completely gone. However, if I take a nap during the day, I will have nightmares about half the time.  I take 150mg just before bed.  The first couple months I was faced with some side effects.  If I didn't go to bed right after taking the medicine, I would be in a dazed state and could fall asleep standing up - that is gone. Erectile dysfunction and studdering were also present in the first 90 days or so.  Both have disappeared.  This is a drug you must give a little time before you see the benefits.",BenKY
