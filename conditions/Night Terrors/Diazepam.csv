1,Diazepam,Night Terrors,5.0,,"May 13, 2021",6,I got prescribed this because I was having chest spasms and was shocked to see that this helped people’s night terrors because since I’ve been on it I’ve had vivid night terrors every night since taking it for the first time in a very long time.,Al
2,Diazepam,Night Terrors,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 27, 2021",4,"Valium (diazepam):Diazepam has turned into a staple for long-standing MOTN insomnia and/or night terrors. Although the half-life is quite long, the active duration of effect seems to be about 5 hours after adjusting to the medication/benzodiazepine tolerance. 10mg works rapidly, and helps me get quality sleep that I would not otherwise be getting. In conjunction with therapy, exercise, good diet, and meditation, I have increased my REM and SWS (deep sleep) *significantly.* I’ve tried Nitrazepam, Clonazepam, Temazepam, Lorazepam (did nothing for me), and Triazolam. I have to say that none relax my nervous system quite like Valium and have to pay tribute to this classic that proves to be an effective adjunct to a holistic treatment of chronic insomnia.",Jimmy

6,Diazepam,Night Terrors,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 10, 2017",11,"I have fibromyalgia and general anxiety disorder. The mix of the two causes seriously disturbing nightmares. I started taking 5mg of valium at night about two weeks ago. The nightmares are all but gone. In fact, most of my dreams now just make me laugh at their absurdity. It's been a real blessing.",Emmalene
7,Diazepam,Night Terrors,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 6, 2016",14,Without 5 mg. of Valium shortly before bedtime I awake in 20 minutes to two hours with an anxiety attack that keeps me up and yet unable to concentrate enough to read or even watch TV. With 5 mg. of Valium I sleep through the night! I've take it before bed for 10 years now. I've taken it  once in the daytime three or four times a year (before  a speech or flying) but otherwise have never gotten any kick out of it or craved it.,JumboJet
8,Diazepam,Night Terrors,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 15, 2014",31,"Valium (diazepam):I was having night terrors several times a night at the end of my pregnancy. I would awake several times a night believing that the terrible nightmare I had was real, I would be terrified, one night I even woke up believing that I was just touched on my arm and woken up. These are worse than nightmares, they are extremely lucid horrific dreams, your lucky when you actually wake up. Being 9 months pregnant I was very hesitant about taking Valium but there came a point when I had to. The first night I got relief from the night terrors and every night after. It's a great medication for this problem but I would make sure that the benefits always outweighed the risks.",Nikkinicole11234
9,Diazepam,Night Terrors,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 12, 2013",13,If you're having night terrors (you find yourself in an awakened state sitting on your bed after a bad dream or bad pain) this is THE medicine.  I've used as little as 2 mg to control this condition but I find 6mg to be the right dose for me. Taken at night or spread out during the day and then 2mg at night I've had wonderful success. I've lived with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder since childhood (almost lost my life in a house fire). I have many other health issues most stemming from obesity. I hope this helps someone else as this is truly a miracle.,ROMANBEAR

I have tried many medications but nothing works as well as Valium does. This includes Klonopin, Xanax, and SSRI's used for this condition that do not work at all.",Matt d
11,Diazepam,Night Terrors,10.0,,"January 3, 2009",100,"Valium (diazepam):I have been taking Valium for about 6 months now and I thank God every day.

I hope this has been helpful to you. I know it has been for me.",Thank God
