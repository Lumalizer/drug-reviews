0,Valium,Night Terrors,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 27, 2021",4,"Diazepam has turned into a staple for long-standing MOTN insomnia and/or night terrors. Although the half-life is quite long, the active duration of effect seems to be about 5 hours after adjusting to the medication/benzodiazepine tolerance. 10mg works rapidly, and helps me get quality sleep that I would not otherwise be getting. In conjunction with therapy, exercise, good diet, and meditation, I have increased my REM and SWS (deep sleep) *significantly.* Iâ€™ve tried Nitrazepam, Clonazepam, Temazepam, Lorazepam (did nothing for me), and Triazolam. I have to say that none relax my nervous system quite like Valium and have to pay tribute to this classic that proves to be an effective adjunct to a holistic treatment of chronic insomnia.",Jimmy

3,Valium,Night Terrors,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 15, 2014",31,"I was having night terrors several times a night at the end of my pregnancy. I would awake several times a night believing that the terrible nightmare I had was real, I would be terrified, one night I even woke up believing that I was just touched on my arm and woken up. These are worse than nightmares, they are extremely lucid horrific dreams, your lucky when you actually wake up. Being 9 months pregnant I was very hesitant about taking Valium but there came a point when I had to. The first night I got relief from the night terrors and every night after. It's a great medication for this problem but I would make sure that the benefits always outweighed the risks.",Nikkinicole11234
