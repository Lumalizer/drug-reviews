1,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 13, 2022",0,"Developed oral thrush while on H Pylori treatment. The huge amount of antibiotics kills off all bacteria and can make the normal yeast that lives in your mouth get out of control. Mouth was dry, sore, fissures opened up on my tongue whole mouth was painful and white spots started to form. On day 3 using nystatin I  noticed fissures are healing and moisture is returning to my mouth. Only side effects are weird taste in mouth. Chemical banana flavor not the best. Nystatin 2.5 ml 3 times a day, after meals.",Mary

3,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 27, 2021",2,"Wow! I actually found these comments by searching to see if Nystatin causes a horrible taste in your mouth. I was diagnosed with Thrush a couple of months ago by my GP after noticing a white coating on my tongue, plus my tongue was burning and I had a terrible taste constantly. No change. Went for my yearly pap & showed my tongue to my gyno, who told me to throw the Nystatin away (I was on my refill at this time), and he prescribed Fluconazole 150 mg. Told me it was better, and it was only one pill. Made no difference. Got the refill on that, still no change. Back to GP...he told me to mix Cepacol and Hydrogen Peroxide and use as a mouthwash & to make an appt. with my dentist. Used that combo four to five times a day and the coating on my tongue went away, as well as the burning sensation...I thought I was cured. Went to dentist yesterday, he said I still have it on my gums and side of tongue. Made appt with ENT..what's up with this medicine??",Silly Sally

7,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 16, 2021",0,"Hello, I have been told to take nystatin to clear up oral thrush I accidentally gave myself from using a steroid based nose spray to help with night time allergies. I didn’t rinse my mouth out because I didn’t know this could happen from using a nose spray. I foolishly got the nose spray from chemist without seeing a doctor first. My question to everyone using nystatin is how long do you keep it in your mouth gurgling or swishing until swallowing? The directions on the bottle says for as long as possible but I’m unsure what that means.",Clueless

11,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 15, 2021",10,"So far I’ve been on Nystatin mouthwash for 4 days and it’s been miserable. My mouth is so dry it’s uncomfortable and my tongue feels raw and dry. Nothing is helping so I’m beginning to wonder if this side effect isn’t from overusing. My thrush cleared in 2 days with this, so by all means it’s amazing for oral thrush, but I’m beginning to wonder if it’s not just burning my tongue since there’s no longer thrush in my mouth to fight?? That rubber banana flavor is quite literally vomit worthy, my tummy has been making LOUD noises and like others, I’ve had a few strange heart palpitations(?) after taking it..but it DID work (4ml 4x daily) to clear the icky.

14,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 20, 2021",7,I am very experienced with oral thrush mostly due to corticosteroid inhaler use. I've had this bout of thrush now for two months. I'm on my second bottle of Nystatin and I am still not better. I told my primary doctor it does not help me but he insists on prescribing this stuff every time. I see my pulmonologist soon and I will ask him for the troches as I find I have better results with this medication. Plus the taste is so much more tolerable!! Nystatin is gag worthy!! For the whole day and night I have such a sour taste in my mouth. It may work for some but not me.,Georgiegirl

On the second day I ended up in the er due to rapid heart rate.   Once I stopped swallowing this med.  And it was out of my system my heart rate returned to normal and so did my blood pressure.

17,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,1.0,,"February 3, 2021",31,"This is my second round with nystatin, which came back about a month after having thrush for 3 months, because I was put on antibiotics for a staph infection.  I combine the nystatin with holistic measures, #1 being diet.  NO carbs, sugar or alcohol, as candida thrives on sugar, and carbs and alcohol break down into sugar in the body.  The last thing you want to do is to feed the candida fungus. The first round didn't work at all, and I suspected actually made it worse.  This time I caught it early and started right away on the diet, Candida-Killer-tea, baking soda swishes, and hydrogen peroxide swishes.  I didn't start with the nystatin until a few days in.  I noticed after 24 hours that it had gotten worse, so I researched the ingredients.  First ingredient:  Alcohol!  It also contains sugar!  Nystatin also contains saccharine, which upsets the flora system....again, the last thing we need.  In a nutshell, nobody should take this medication as it is counter productive.",Shay

19,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 19, 2020",11,I just started taking the oral Nystatin medication. I just read all the comments regarding not having success with it.I just caught myself taking a sip of water 5 minutes after I swallowed it. I could see that being an issue. Subconsciously I was thinking how awful it tasted and just grabbed the water. I'm thinking for it to work to the full affect you can't drink anything for 30 minutes otherwise I'd be flushing my mouth and not giving the Nystatin time to work on my tongue and throat.Just my two cents.One last thing I don't like the taste of it going down and the after taste hangs there for a bit.,Vinny

So, dr. put me on nystatin because the back/side of my tongue hurt on both sides.  I finally looked at it in mirror and saw white spots.  It starting spreading on the back of my throat and tongue.  I took one dose 4x a day faithfully.  It started clearing up after about my 5th day of taking med.  So everything was fine until 3 days after my med. ran out.  Its now back and starting the same way as last time with my tongue hurting on both sides.  Dr. is going to do another treatment, same as last one.  If it doesn't stay away they want to send me to ear/nose/throat dr. and have biopsy done.

I'll never use that inhaler again as not worth all of this. Was prescribed nystan 30ml and the dentist told me to swirl it in my mouth for 5 mins at a time, 4 times daily. I can't keep it in my mouth for no way near that long as makes me heave, the feeling of it in mouth with all the stickyness makes me heave, the second dose was worse, especially when it says to swallow it slowly, never again.

34,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 5, 2020",34,Nystatin is absolute garbage.  I’m now on my 4th bottle with no sign of it doing anything.  I’ve also pumped myself with probiotics and limited alcohol.  Very frustrating and Nystatin seems to do nothing.  Tastes good at least but not effective.  Based on so many other negative reviews it’s surprising how popular this is prescribed to adults with oral thrush.,Joe

36,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 4, 2020",47,I actually developed oral thrush from something really bizarre... So because I had to work during this Corona virus crisis.. Every time I came in I was so paranoid about something being in my mouth.. Like virus particles that I was rinsing with an extremely heavy alcohol mouthwash. I developed thrush because of this..I have been taking this medication for about 2 days. So far it has not helped. I noticed that somebody else wrote something which is actually happening to me also which makes me a little nervous.. I have been having some kind of weird twinges in my chest. I am really paranoid that the infection has spread down my a oesophagus and into my lungs.  This is a possible complication of thrush. I will give it another 2 or 3 days and then I will go back to the doctor the only problem is I'm really scared because I have to go to urgent care and with everything that is going on I am so paranoid about going to urgent care.,Amanda

40,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,1.0,,"April 2, 2020",49,"I developed oral thrush for the first time after taking macrobid generic for UTI. The antibiotic made me outrageously ill from all of the extreme side effects I experienced. I was able to get nystatin over the phone. However I immediately had a severe reaction of chest tightness, rapid and abnormal heart rate. Luckily about 24 hours later it seems to have subsided but now I’ve been trying everything I can OTC. Nothing is giving me relief. The feeling in my throat is horrible and sometimes it’s unbearable and impossible to swallow. I’m definitely dehydrated as I cannot even force myself to sip let alone drink water. Doctors have been less than helpful as they don’t want to see patients due to social distancing guidelines from COVID. I’m Hoping the use of baking soda and saline mouth washes as well as acidophilus probiotic pills will start being effective as I can’t take much more of all of these issues.

Keflex had plenty of times no reaction when other antibiotic metronidazole was given by ER doctor I had a thrush reaction on mouth.  Then nystatin liquid worked, but had to use virgin cononut with a cotton swab to alleviate later to rebuild my gut to down size the thrush colony in my body.",Guinea pig

64,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 13, 2018",27,"I developed oral thrush after taking the notoriously problematic antibiotic known as Metronidazole and was prescribed Nystatin liquid for the thrush. after swishing and swallowing this medicine 3 times a day for a couple days, I notice I’ve started to have sudden and painful urges to have a bowel movement and when I do, it smells like rotten eggs and has an odd consistency. This is the only side effect of the Nystatin I’m experiencing which has already made a noticeable difference in my thrush but I’m ready to be done taking this medicine. The cramps and bathroom trips are inconvenient and embarrassing. I notice the longer I leave the Nystatin in my mouth and gargle with it, the better it works in clearing up my tongue. It also helps to wait as long as possible to eat/drink after taking Nystatin.",Candidaddy
65,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,,,"February 2, 2018",13,"I developed a fungus infection of the bottom lip.  My doctor wanted to put me on a systemic pill, but I asked if there was anything topical I could try.  He suggested Nystatin.  I have been on it three days and my lips have not peeled.  They were peeling every two days before.  I just use  Q tip and put it on my lip.  I got it because I am immune compromised and my white count is at the lowest it has been in a long time, 1.7",Healing One
66,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,8.0,,"January 7, 2018",26,"I have COPD, and between prednisone and all the inhalers I use I always have thrush on my tongue. This week the thrush went into my throat. It was awful. My doctor prescribed nystatin and within 2 days my throat stopped hurting and my tongue is clearing and feels much better. Nystatin works great for me the only had side is you lose your taste buds while you're using it. They do come back once medicine is fine though. I can deal with temporary losing tastebuds as long as my tongue and throat don't hurt.",Lee1225

Omg my tongue started to get numb and I have issue breathing. So don’t use it right before or after u plan to brush your teeth. My  tongue would feel half numb. Not a good feeling.,Cj rey

I've been suffering with unknown Candida for 4 years with it now affecting my stomach, throat and tongue. The coughing has subsided and my tongue is amazingly clear! I thought I was an alien of some sort dealing with a weird looking tongue all of these years but thanks to my Dr's diagnosis and prescribing Nystatin I feel sooooo much better. I suffer with Systematic Lupus and all of my medicine's are causing the thrush. Amazing product and it doesn't taste half bad either. My only gripe Is that nothing taste the same anymore but maybe that's temporary.",Verymotivated1

It really works and right away. My mouth, throat, and chest stopped hurting after taking it twice. I have coughed up blood before I started this medication. My cough is better also. I just can't figure out why my lips are black. I go to the doctor this week for a biopsy,  so, I'll show the doctor.",BrendyLou

75,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 30, 2014",63,"63 yrs old, was prescribed liquid, 120.00 nystatin, 100,000 unitls/ml, 2 tsp., for 4 times a day as needed, for thrush that was in throat, and I believe going into esophagus.  Was not in mouth this time (had it 6 yrs ago).  Read where hydrogen peroxide kills it, and had been using toothpaste with hydrogen peroxide in it, so wasn't on tongue.  But throat hurt, was actually coughing up blood in sputum.  Only two doses and throat and chest doesn't hurt, coughing has lessened, and I believe bleeding has stopped! Notice the dose is for kids, but I'm 63.  But it is working!  Could hardly swallow, hurt so much. Not hurting so after only 2 doses. Amazing medicine! Was given 3 day supply.",Illinois resident

77,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,2.0,,"December 23, 2011",49,I had to take this medication for oral thrush after a couple of rounds of antibiotics. Unfortunately the oral nystatin suspension gave me a terrible allergic reaction. I developed a very itchy body rash (hives) so I never got to find out if the nystatin would have worked for the oral thrush.,Anonymous
78,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,9.0,,"April 28, 2011",61,"I've been using Nystatin suspension to cope with the oral thrush I get from all of the Prednisone I have to take.  I've got systemic lupus and my kidneys went and started to fail.  The prednisone is a life saver for me, but the thrush hurts.  Thanks to the nystatin, the thrush is coming under control.  My only gripe is that the nystatin is starting to make me nauseous, really nauseous.  I don't need EXTRA nausea.  Between the lupus and the prednisone, my stomach is already hooped.  I DO love how fast the nystatin got started on giving me relief from the thrush, though.  I can sing again!",Anonymous
79,Nystatin,Oral Thrush,10.0,,"July 11, 2009",171,"My father, a brain tumor patient, had oral thrush, which is very common for those taking long-term Dilantin. This swish-and-swallow medication worked wonders for him, within about 3 days. Be sure to take it for the full prescription period, usually 14 days. Also, the longer you can hold the gargle, the longer the contact between drug and organisms. Thrush can also move from the mouth into the throat, and it can recur quickly, so out of sight doesn't necessarily mean anything. Again, take it for the full period recommended by the doctor.",brainhospice
