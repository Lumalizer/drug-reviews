0,Fluconazole,Oral Thrush,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 2, 2021",2,"Took the one dose for thrush in my mouth. Within the hour I threw some of it up.  24 hrs later I end up with red (tomato red skin) and itching and rash all up my arms over my belly and neck. Been drinking water, had a bath (which helped calm the rash a bit) and now trying to ward off a panic attack. Horrible, horrible experience I would have rather dealt with the thrush...hoping this med leaves my body soon",tomatosally

4,Fluconazole,Oral Thrush,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 1, 2020",7,fluconazole didn't work for my oral thrush. I guess it wasn't a strong enough antifungal,Leah J
5,Fluconazole,Oral Thrush,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 23, 2020",29,"Diflucan (fluconazole):Diflucan had no side effects for me. Taken this like a million times. For thrush, vagina yeast infection, skin yeast infection, and athletes foot. Wait it out with the results of the pill. It's not instant, it takes 24- 48 hrs to work and then it is better quickly. If you need instant relief, use cream or antifungal mouthwash immediately and then take the pill. Only reason I didn't give 10 stars is you never know how many you need to take. I stick with 3 each time as that seems to do the trick.",Lindseylovely
6,Fluconazole,Oral Thrush,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 23, 2019",11,"First time I took fluconazole I experienced diarrhea and dizziness often (was on it for several months due to oral thrush as a result of too much antibiotics and weakened immune system). Second time I took it, my side effects were completely different (again was on it due to oral thrush and weak immune system). Had diarrhea for only 1 day, and only felt dizzy once. But I started breaking out severely on the T-level of my face with severely painful cystic acne. I was only on the medication for 5 days and I broke out so much! I realize by the 3rd day that the reason I was breaking out was due to the fluconazole. It takes about a week after finishing the medication for it to completely flush out of the body. Horrible experience, had to call out from work as a result. It took me months to recover from the cystic scars. Always be cautious of what you take and how your body reacts to medication! I learned that the hard way.",Stein

10,Fluconazole,Oral Thrush,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 28, 2018",19,I have taken diflucan many times for a yeast infection on my bottom lip caused by my steroid inhaler. 150mg 1 week repeated the next. It worked great for the first few times. But now it clears it up a little but not all the way. If anyone could tell if the dosage is wrong it would be great. These doctors have no idea.,Laking

12,Fluconazole,Oral Thrush,10.0,,"July 12, 2016",70,"I get yeast infections often.  Recently, I've experienced the hell that is thrush!  I thought only little ones got this, but I was wrong.  I tried the Rx mouth wash and there was little to no change.  So I asked for a Diflucan pill because it's always worked on my vag yeast infections.  What do ya' know, within 24 hours there is a marked difference, and my poor tongue is getting some relief.  Great med, love the one dose system, and it works for me.",Anonymous
13,Fluconazole,Oral Thrush,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 22, 2016",45,"A few days after finishing a round of antibiotics (metronidazole) I started to get oral thrush. I took two rounds of nystatin (oral rinse) and still had the thrush. Doctor prescribed fluconazole (150mg for 7 days) - thrush responded very well but at the end of the duration it started to come back. Dr called in another prescription (150mg for 5 days) and so far my oral thrush is gone (I've been done with the prescription for 4 days).The only side effect I have noticed is a 'side stitch/pinch/ache' type feeling. It's mild but noticeable and started the day I took the fluconazole and continues today. I've read it can stay in your system for 7 days so hoping the pain goes away very soon.",Anonymous

15,Fluconazole,Oral Thrush,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 8, 2012",36,"I suffered with a yeast infection in my milk ducts which made breast feeding extremely painful. My baby also had oral thrush that would not go away as we continued to pass the fungi back and forth with all other treatments (nipple cream, gentian violet, nystatin, probiotics). I took one pill per week for 2 weeks, continued to breastfeed and we were BOTH cleared of candida!",Lo-ro
