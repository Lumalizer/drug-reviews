0,Ketoconazole,Oral Thrush,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2018",2,Do not take! I am a healthy 27 year old female that had a bad case of oral thrush due to an antibiotic and instantly started experiencing side pain. I waited five days before experiencing pain excruciating  enough to make me chose childbirth over this pain. I went to urgent care and was diagnosed with gastritis because of this medication and it messed my liver up! Do not take!! There are better options!!!,rhemcg1413
