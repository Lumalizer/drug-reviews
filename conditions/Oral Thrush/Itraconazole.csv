0,Itraconazole,Oral Thrush,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 20, 2019",19,"Sporanox (itraconazole):Took maximum dose of 400mg for two weeks as other antifungal didn't work. My side effects were many nausea, diarrhoea feeling sad dry mouth racing heart rate. I'm glad its over and thrush is 100% eliminated.  Works well but I guess every drug has its side effects. Now after completing course the side effects have all gone expect for dry mouth which I was told by the gp could be with for a few weeks after completion.",Faz
