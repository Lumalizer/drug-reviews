0,Diflucan,Oral Thrush,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 23, 2020",29,"Diflucan had no side effects for me. Taken this like a million times. For thrush, vagina yeast infection, skin yeast infection, and athletes foot. Wait it out with the results of the pill. It's not instant, it takes 24- 48 hrs to work and then it is better quickly. If you need instant relief, use cream or antifungal mouthwash immediately and then take the pill. Only reason I didn't give 10 stars is you never know how many you need to take. I stick with 3 each time as that seems to do the trick.",Lindseylovely
