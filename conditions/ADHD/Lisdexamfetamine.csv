1,Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 30, 2022",0,"Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):I've been on Vyvanse for 12 years, starting when I was 6 years old. Thus, it's impossible to think of my life without it. It has given me the gift of focus and clarity. I can't really go into specifics as Vyvanse has played at least some role in every one of my life achievements that I can remember and that built my character. However, I also must look at what Vyvanse took from me. Middle school was a bad time in which I was small, lonely, and awkward (I was on 60mg). In high school I decided to change my habits for the better and learned to take better care of myself. This was one of the best decisions I made with Vyvanse, and I wish I had done it earlier. My best advice is to not take Vyvanse during your main growth stages. If you are, make sure you eat in a caloric surplus every day no matter how hard it is & play a sport to stay healthy and lean. Take value in forming relationships and be confident. If you take these steps, I'd recommend Vyvanse 100 percent.",SomeVyvanseUser

The side effects outweighed the issues it solved. it's quite literally borderline crack cocaine. side effects:-extreme lack of appetite (it was so difficult to eat even with reminders, it felt like being permanently bored/uninterested in food.)-constantly sweating even if you're cold (which resulted in always being dehydrated)-so much anxiety! it increases your heart rate so if you think about something that gives you anxiety, it's almost impossible to calm down again.-extreme weight loss (I was 89 pounds -  that's not healthy.)-always feeling strung out (headaches, shakiness, weakness, fatigue, etc)I started out on at 30mg dose and gradually decreased my dosage to 5mg but the side effects were still extreme so I just stopped taking it. this medication is great it's just very hard on your body. everyone will react differently.",16 female

4,Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 26, 2022",0,"Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):I've been on Vyvanse for 6 months. The first few months were glorious! This was the 'honeymoon phase' and I was euphoric. Overall, the first 4-5 months were great. I felt like a completely new person. All my problems seemed to vanish. I was energetic, happy, calm and ridiculously motivated. I would work 14 hours straight every day (self-employed), and I loved it! I felt like it was going to change my life completely. Adjusting the dosage is a bit tricky initially, but I eventually seemed to stabilise on 40 mg./ per day. In the past two months, it's all been downhill. Extreme flushing and all the positive effects are gone. I tried raising my dose to 60 mg., which gave me ONE great day, then nothing. All motivation is gone, I feel spaced out, I can't focus, and my mood is very low. And, worst of all, I have SEVERE hair loss. It's so bad, I want to cry. This is a known side effect.

If you plan on taking a higher dose (40mg or more), prepare to be dependent on it. I am not a person with an addictive personality but I am completely dependent on Vyvanse (60mg everyday).  On the positive side, it has helped me considerably - I am able to complete my school work more efficiently and get better grades, I'm more motivated to do things and attend to my responsibilities, and I am overall a much higher-functional human. The only problem is that without this drug I am a complete disaster.  I feel depressed, no motivation, I overeat, I become extremely on edge and can easily lose my cool and result to many impulsive and destructive actions and before I started taking Vyvanse I did not have these issues. Overall, the drug significantly helps me but over a period of time prepare to feel like a different person if you plan to stop taking it.",UnknownCanadian

The only thing is I am NOT locked in, laser-focus but I am still productive and my personality is still Jessica lol. I think the next medication refill; I am able to manage a higher dosage 50mg or more because I am not sensitive. My only side effect is dry mouth, and non other, slight appetite suppressed. I just stay hydrated which is awesome. I wish I started on Vyvanse first...but with all things through trial and error, we learn. This medication is worth every penny!

Non stimulant medication did not work for me and Wellbutrin was a nightmare for me.  Because of past substance abuse this was the only option I had. While it’s true you can abuse it, because of how this works the potential for abuse is much lower.  It is a pro drug that your body’s enzymes convert to the active parent drug.  It has been a game changer for me and it works best if you can eat small amounts throughout the day.  I am more focused, calm and my friends and family can tell when I am not on it.

I had read so much bad reviews but my doctor told me not to worry. Even at 20mg I noticed (2 hours after taking) a calmness in my thoughts. I’ve always had a constant chatter of a million thoughts going on. I was shocked. It silenced my thoughts. I still had trouble focusing and keep on task. Increasing my dose to 30mg then 40mg. I have had little to no real side effects. I can’t believe how long I went untreated because I was scared of stimulants. It has made an amazing change in my life.

Normally I'm a scatterbrained mess due to ADHD, but Vyvanse has allowed me to live a productive and wonderful life. Not sure where I would be without it. Have only had to raise my dose once in the 12 years that I've been on it, and only because I started an anxiety drug that slightly diminished its effects. Started at 40 mg daily, now at 50 mg daily. The only lingering side effects have been minor: decreased appetite in the mornings (I take my pill with breakfast to help with that), dry mouth in the mornings, and increased libido (girlfriend loves that, as do I, so I'd say it's a positive!). I highly recommend Vyvanse for ADHD. It is a life changer. Only downside is that it is incredibly expensive, even with insurance.

I don't snack very often and I'm not into big breakfasts, secondly even those days the drug is not working like it should I got very aggressive to the point it almost got me to jail. I'm not usually an aggressive type of person, never in my life did I think this drug would get me into trouble. It really gave me no patience for people, became isolated and I did have more energy to do personal tasks and keep focus but dehydration, aggressive behavour, being paranoid and feeling like the drug wasn't even working half the time like it should.

I lost a childhood best friend of 36 years to this poison. 5 years she’s been on it. She went to 90mg a day/ then crashing at noon so a Adderall booster was prescribed to her in the afternoons all within a year. She developed antisocial behavior, agoraphobia, apathy, rabbit hole syndrome, spending addiction, drank alcohol like a fish, lost a ton of weight, and much more. Slowly she stopped calling, texting, and literally dropped me and everyone but immediate family. It’s been almost a year since we’ve spoken. I had drug addict parents & sibling, & know the signs. I miss her deeply, & my hope and prayer is that she finds a way to rid herself of this drug before it destroys her life completely.

Without it, I probably would be failing my chemistry class right now, but thanks to it I have been getting 80s and 90s on my tests and quizzes after I started it. One problem with it though is getting distracted, be sure to tune out all distractions before it kicks in, or else you risk concentrating on something else. Tolerance is also an issue, but you can reduce it by only taking it when you really need it and trying to take drug holidays. I didn’t have much side effects on it, but it can result in euphoria and so is addictive, especially If you try to chase that feeling with higher doses. It also hasn’t really helped my fidgeting at all, but I also have social anxiety and it’s actually helped increase my confidence. The only big problem I have with it is needing to take tolerance breaks, since taking it everyday seems to make it less effective.",lI-Texas-Il

Making connections that are not there. To me it felt so real. I didn't seek help because of paranoia. It ended in me getting into a bunch legal trouble because I thought people were out to get me. My life was completely ruined. I lost everything and I mean everything. I lost the love of my life because I threatened her family thinking they were replaced by robots because I thought AI was taking over and messing with me. I thought the craziest stuff. After coming off it I spent months wanting to commit suicide. I ended up homeless because of my depression. I slept in my car. One night I got drunk wanting to commit suicide. I woke up to cops. Impounded vehicle and dui. I tried to get help everywhere. I never got the help I needed. Keep this in mind when you decide to take this drug. You will be the one suffering alone.

I did not want to go up any higher on my dose so my doctor switched me to Vyvanse. We have landed on 50mg of Vyvanse a day. It does work well for focus but does not give me the morning boost of energy adderall did because it releases over time instead of peaking earlier. I do not have the curbed appetite side effects some people have reported but I have been on stimulants for several years and am used to it.

It was just discovered that I may have ADHD. At 35 years old. I researched it and did questionnaires for my dr and my parents provided my history throughout childhood to determine I do in fact have ADHD. This explains why I’ve been self medicating with stimulant drugs and other drugs since 12 years old. I also have depression/ anxiety/ addiction issues/ borderline personality disorder. I take other medicines too. Leading up to now I reached rock bottom with drug addiction leading to homelessness and three rehabilitation attempts. I am currently on disability and sleep all the time. Possibly due to relying on stimulant drugs for years to function. I am so hopeful this is the medication I’ve needed my whole life.

I’d been scoring between 171-176 (with just adderall). Although taking vyvanse again felt great and I felt very focused and that I could remember details about the passages, I saw my score drop and stay at 169 (a statistically significant difference for the LSAT). When I stopped vyvanse again and went back to just adderall, my score immediately went back up to a 174.

Before, I got Focalin XR (20mg) for ~4 years but started to experience inconvenient side effects (heavy sweating, crash when the effect would fade).1st time taking Vyvanse was amazing: great mood, very focused, extremely motivated (Focalin lacked this motivation component for me).However, after several months the effects aren’t as significant anymore so there’s a tolerance. Also it can make me very tired and irritated when I don't take it (not always). I started to have the same lack of focus/procrastination behavior like with Focalin again, maybe not as significant though. Sometimes I feel empty and sad too but I don‘t blame Vyvanse for this, it can have other reasons.So all in all I‘d say it’s a good medication, especially in the beginning, but it won‘t do all the work for you.

I have been on several stimulants since 2019, including Adderall XR and Dexedrine Spansule, and I find Vyvanse to be the optimal choice. My dose is 60mg and it improves my focus for several hours without a sense of agitation. It also seemed to calm my mind and allows me to do one thing at a time. As an academic, I have found that to be particularly beneficial when reading long texts.While I appreciate the relief Vyvanse can bring, I need to reiterate that no single pill is going to offer an immediate fix for any mental health condition. Especially with ADHD, sleep and regular exercise are paramount. Over the last two years, I have realized that stimulants simply won't work for me if I am not well rested, which I believe is the case for most people.In terms of supplements, I take vitamins (important to find a mix that is suitable for you), omega 3 fish oil, and magnesium daily.",pptom

I should say one morning I had just gotten out of my driveway when I remembered I had forgotten to take it. By then it was nearly 7am so there was a definite notice when the medicine started to work that day. Usually I take it around 5:30am so by the time I get to work it’s working well. I’m well focused throughout the day, less anxious, I don’t fidget as much, and less agitated. The same cannot be said for Adderrall. If I had to say one negative thing about Vyvanse is that my engine is still revving when I’m ready to wind down for the day, so it takes me a few hours to wind down. I have a great insurance plan but before the prior authorization kicked in the cost was well over $400. With the coupon well over $200, once the prior authorization kicked in with my insurance, $30.

The side effects are very minimal and it doesn’t affect my appetite or social skills. There is no high and no crash.

My daughter initially tried Biphentin but it did not help her symptoms and caused her not to eat or sleep. With Vyvanse there is a dramatic improvement of her symptoms and less side effects. It just suppresses her appetite. We take her off occasionally to help her appetite and have also tried a short acting formulation  that she takes after breakfast and again after lunch so her appetite isn’t as effected. I experience very good results on Vyvanse as well (and don’t mind curbing my appetite slightly).,T2T
78,Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,5.0,,"February 1, 2020",103,"Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):My (unprofessional) advice is to take positive reviews from people who have taken this drug for a short time with a very large grain of salt.  Vyvanse is basically a legal amphetamine and the body takes time to react to it and eventually builds tolerance to it.  The ""Vyvyanse Crash"" is real, in  my experience, as many others have observed.  This often leads to patients continually upping their dosages.  As for ADD and ADHD, it is interesting that both have become epidemics in the U.S., but not in Europe.  I believe this is because in the US of the massive profitability pharmaceutical experience in developing new drugs for every affliction.  That is just my opinion.  Regular exercise and diet are natural ways to address depression, ADD, ADHD and other conditions.  Common sense, but the pharma companies can't profit from it.  Everyone's physiology is different, so give Vyvance a try.  I hope it helps you.",Roscoe

Another side effect is a reduction in patience, hence slight increase in anger, things seem more irritable however this is something you can easily control if you are aware of it.

I liked Vyvanse for the first week.  The problem was the potency and the crash.  I experienced 3 hours of euphoria followed by 3 hours of hyper focus and then the final huge crash.  The super highs and super lows made life much worse for me. The thing was the Vyvanse had potential.  If it was more even throughout the day I might have something really good.  Adderall was ok. Too much irritability.  I wanted focus and mood benefits  not anger and excess energy.  After tons of research I found Dex.  I started on 10mg IR 3 times a day.

It takes a long time for the Vynase to kick in, but when it does it causes tremendous dry mouth like I've never experienced.  I would take it at 5am. At 10:30 I would feel dry mouth and anxiety for about an hour. On my ride home from work around 5:30pm, I got very drowsy. By 8:00pm  I was extremely drowsy and would fall asleep on the couch if I sat down to watch TV. This never happened with Adderall. My overall anxiety seems better while on the Vynase. My mood also stayed relatively constant throughout the day, versus the ups and downs I feel on IR Adderall. I found that my appetite actually increased on Vynase, and I gained 8 pounds in 1 month which is unacceptable to me. Nothing else changed in my life except the medication, and I attribute the weight gain to this. Also, constipation was worse.

I does not matter how much Vyvanse you take, your body will not let the amphetamine level go any higher than it can process it. This gives you control. Vyvanse is a spark, it lets you chose what to focus on, rather than make you hyper and euphoric like other ADHD meds do. Why it does not work for some people? Because most people fail to use ADHD meds accordingly! No med is a ""magic bullet.""
