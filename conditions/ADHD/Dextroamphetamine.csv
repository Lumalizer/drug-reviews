1,Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,10.0,,"March 5, 2022",1,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):This medication works really well for helping me feel more focused, and more energized as well. I don't feel sleepy while taking this medication, which is good because part of the reason I started taking it was due to excessive sleepiness that wasn't caused by any other medical problem. The slow-release capsule kept me awake for too long so I didn't sleep so well at night though, so I switched to the short-acting version of this medication and now I can be very alert for about 6 hours from one tablet of the short-acting tablet, and if I need another one I can have one, but I usually don't take two in a day because I don't feel I need more than that. I do find that makes me feel more confident, happy and outgoing. It certainly helps me be more awake and attentive.",Elyse
2,Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 7, 2022",5,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):I’ve been struggling with emotional/social numbness, lack of focus or drive, an intense caffeine addiction, procrastination, apathy, depression, an inability to improve my life, binge-eating, self-loathing, and even the seedlings of alcoholism, all connected to my severe ADHD. Been on a very high amount of Dexedrine for a couple of months now, and my life is completely different. My self-confidence skyrocketed, I’m able to go to a very drunk people-infested mosh pit and not have to get drunk to have a blast, I’m doing the most work I ever have, I’m focused and driven, I’m organized, I’m eating healthy, I’m realizing my worth and making breakthroughs about myself, and I’m ten times more empathetic and able to support my family and friends and girlfriend more than ever. This stuff truly changed my life. The only negatives are that I still have a caffeine addiction, which has given me very very intense panic attacks. Also insomnia. But nonetheless, I’d say 9.6/10",Boatboy
3,Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 25, 2022",3,Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):Extremely beneficial and helpful to this day. Not only does it actually help me focus therefore lowering my level anxiety I get so much more done and I quite frankly do not notice unpleasant effects when it wears off.  Fringe benefit is that it does suppress my appetite and tend to overeat.,Mdf111982
4,Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 21, 2022",5,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):The very best ADHD medicine I’ve tried! I started out on methylphenidate which did absolutely nothing for me then switched to Adderall which worked but caused me anxiety quite often.  After being on Adderall for a while I did my own research and came across Dexadrine/dextroamphetamine and how tons of people who struggled with anxiety on other ADHD meds loved It. I asked my doctor to switch and I am so thankful that I did!! With Dexadrine I don’t feel anxious or jittery but have tons of drive and focus to get things done! I have to point out, for those of you who like Adderall and the speedy feeling you get from it then Dexedrine may not be for you.  However if you are like me and don’t like feeling like you’ve taken a narcotic stimulant then you should certainly try Dexadrine/dextroamphetamine…You won’t regret it!! It feels far more natural for me personally than the Adderall ever did.  I am so thankful for this medication!",Anonymous Panda
5,Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 18, 2022",7,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):No buzz, no crash, just adds the focus I need to overcome my ADD (not hyperactive) and get things done. I don't need to have the gun of deadline on my head to start and complete quality work. I always knew I had good intellectual potential but I was diffuse like a lens out of focus. This enables me to deliver my full measure since 2010.My MD had me trial vyvanse, Ritalin, Adderall and Dexedrine. While all helped me with ADD symptoms, Dexedrine is the one that does not have any detrimental side effects and feels the cleanest (does not change my behavior, my head feels normal, but focused). I also like the possibility of getting ""off"" the medication if I don't have anything important in the afternoon I just will not take the noon pill. It also helped me keep my tolerance down over the years. I am still at 5mg twice a day. My BP is 120/80, I am physically active at 50 years old.

My two complaints would be recently in Dec 2021 I've had trouble with my Zenzedi 30 mg getting to the pharmacy due to a backorder. It has interfered with my treatment and didn't realize how effective this medicine was until I went back to generic adderall. It has been a very underwhelming change to say the least and on top of it my doctor wrote the prescription for same mg of generic adderall as I was on for Zenzedi and can say anyone that has experienced this knows they are not near equivelant per mg. Second complaint- I recently was laid off from work and lost my insurance that had me at a $30 copay for my medicine. Well no problem I remember the savings card through Arbor Pharma said cash paying patients pay no more than $75, well how dishonest that was. Cheapest I've been able to pay was using a Goodrx for $230 each fill. Not a pleasant experience paying that much!",Anonymous

It changed my life. Impressive the performance increase at work. My talk is much more fluid, I can organise my thoughts much faster, I miss or forget stuff much less, my memory got much better, stabilise my appetite (I am slightly overweight), much more energy to do stuff. The only significant side effect was I lost a little bit the fine control of my hand and sometimes I lose the equilibrium, but it is minor face to benefits.",Felipe

Methylphenidate gave me anxiety and irritability on the comedown, where as Lisdexamfetamine was barely noticeable because it's a prodrug which is slowly converted into Dextroamphetamine in the body. I have zero side effects from this ""dangerous"" drug compared to all the SSRIs I tried, which gave me concentration issues, sexual problems, and extreme tiredness. Dex on the other hand has given me my life back and is smooth as butter.",ret
11,Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 11, 2021",4,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):Wow. I have tried Ritalin, Adderall and now Dexedrine. Let me tell you this drug works the best. I don’t know why this drug doesn’t get prescribed more or first line med to try. To tell you the truth I think Adderall should be banned. Adderall has Dextroamphetamine which is Dexedrine but here where I think Adderall should be banned. Adderall also has Levoamphetamine which gives you ungodly vasoconstriction. Levoamphetamine should actually be banned. There is no need to have Levoamphetamine and Dextroamphetamine in 1 pill. Adderall is like 3:1 with both Dextroamphetamine and Levoamphetamine. All Levoamphetamine does is raise your blood pressure and constrict your blood vessels. Dextroamphetamine doesn’t do this. Well it does but no where near like when I took Adderall. I feel calm on Dexedrine and when I took Adderall at any dose, I felt like a crack head. I believe that’s the Levo and Dextro  combination does this, even my psychiatrist agrees with me to a certain extent",Mike
12,Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 9, 2021",25,"Zenzedi (dextroamphetamine):I'm 37, was dx'd ADHD at 9. My parents thought it was rubbish due to my grades and voracious reading, and that my typical ADHD (and ASD) traits was me being lazy/immature/bratty/oversensitive. After two decades of life failure (grades don't predict success) I sought treatment. Only Zenzedi (NOT any of the generic d-amps) helped reliably with my inability to not procrastinate, interrupt, lose things, feel so overwhelmed that I avoided everything. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of this med and I've heard that it may be discontinued in favor of a new ""non-abusable"" IR d,l-amp product by the pharma corp that makes Zenzedi!

13,Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 22, 2021",1,"I've been using dexamphetamine (Elvanse, 50mg) for a few months now. The first thing I noticed is that it makes me feel more euphoric. When school started I could pay attention throughout the entire lectures (1.5h each) without losing focus. Studying is a lot easier because I don't get distracted and I don't have the urge to move or take a walk every second. I can just sit down for 5 hours straight and study without getting exhausted. I do lose track of time because of this however.Benefits:Motivated, euphoric, confident (reduced social anxiety by a lot), no distractions. no restlessness.Side effects:Not hungry-->weight loss, inc. heart rate/pressure, not tired (I use melatonin), have dump more often, dry mouth, irritated easily, cold feet.I am still chaotic like before and impulsiveness (spending money) is still a problem. But it doesn't bother me as much.Besides being chaotic, the medication takes care of most of my ADHD complaints. The side effects are for sure manageable.",Jason

It has helped me to focus and manage a demanding career throughout the years.  It is important to be aware of the best pharmaceutical company for your drug.  My health plan’s go-to is cheaper and less effective than my preferred brand.  It can make a difference.

19,Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 2, 2021",1,"I will keep this short. I have been wanting to switch to dexamfetamine ever since Vyvanse was introduced and Vyvanse just being the prodrug version of dextroampetamine. Vyvanse worked so well that I was confused why the drug itself is not prescribed more regularly. I take 50 mg of Vyvanse with 20 mg of dex spilt across the day or as needed.Adderall feels like it just makes me motivated not focused if that makes sense. Dex, if I take it and sit on a task. I will remain on that task. Eveoko or whatever is so bad, just makes me anxious. Like one user mentioned, it's the levoamphetamine possibly that contributes to that. I realized that the reluctance is a historical thing more than anything else. It was synthesized sometime in the 19th century and was heavily utilized my the military with ww1 and ww2. Given the widespread availability, abuse followed, and thus it was the scapegoat that eventually led to the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act",Beadking
20,Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,9.0,,"August 1, 2021",7,"Zenzedi (dextroamphetamine):I have ADHD, formerly known as ADD. It wasn’t caught until I was about 19 years old, around the same time my mom was diagnosed with it as well. Turns out that it is usually hereditary, and is related to Neuro degenerative conditions and can actually progress into things like fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s and even Alzheimer’s. I have fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome, narcolepsy, suspected multiple sclerosis but insurance won’t pay for the test, and even now getting symptoms of Parkinson’s.There are only four ingredients in this formulation. They are also free of lactose and gluten, with no generic company will guarantee. I am lactose intolerant and celiac, so the generic medications would make me very sick. These have far fewer side effects and are almost as good as the original dexedrine tablets.

21,Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 29, 2021",2,"Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):This med has been the most useful for me for my ADHD. Vyvanse didn't feel quite the same for me, but it might for you since it's the prodrug version of this. Adderall helped but made me feel cloudy-headed + physically overstimulated at the height of it's effect. Dexedrine targets most of my issues; being able to shift focus, getting side-tracked less, completing non-stimulating tasks/chores, and drifting off in my own head mid-conversation less. It quiets my head so it's not constantly buzzing with random distractions. However, If I don't eat within 3 hours of taking it, I get intense neck pain which causes a bad headache/stiffness/pain all day. It's kind of a bizarre side effect, but I should be eating in the morning anyway. Since this med does decrease my appetite, it's probably good that is has a built-in punishment system for if I neglect to feed myself lol. But I would definitely recommend this med, especially if adderall made you feel cloudy-headed or overstimulated.",Hello

Dexedrine makes me feel completely calm, clear-headed, and motivated. I used to be so tired and foggy-brained, and many days were lost to 'recovering' from, well, life. Now I feel like I can do anything I want. I can hardly believe it. I tried Ritalin first and found it to be rubbish - it gave me headaches, insomnia, and mild anxiety, and seemed very unpredictable in terms of effects too. Dexedrine is nothing like that.

It helped my emotional overreactivity, but not other ADHD symptoms like initiation of tasks and related anxiety/irritability, procrastination, and negative ruminations (mentally getting ""stuck""). Obviously, my brain needs help with dopamine, and too much norepinephrine is dulling and unpleasantly sedating.

I don't know how else to describe it other than being ""smooth"" and without it I don't know what we would do.  His specialist basically said this medicine is a more pure form of amphetamine than the other name brands on the market. If you have tried medicine after medicine....give this a try.

Grades in school went from 60s-80s, I could actually focus long enough to plan my life and pay attention. Only problem I had was the tolerance, although my dosage was raised and now I can take it regularly without feeling it, it made it really hard to sleep if I took it to late, and if the dosage is too high, or you are just starting, you get a really unpleasant buzz. Even though that buzz makes you super motivated and lets you get stuff done, it makes it really hard to relax and makes you more prone to panic attacks.",Lizzi Tree
