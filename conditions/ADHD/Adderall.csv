1,Adderall,ADHD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 29, 2022",1,"I was on Ritalin for a few months before switching. I’ve been on Adderall for 4 days now and today I called my psychiatrist to tell her I will never take this drug again. Sandoz was the generic I took and in under a week I felt suicidal, I was eating less than 500 calories a day due to extreme appetite loss, and I can barely sleep more than 5 hours. I’m miserable. None of my ADHD symptoms were improved, I honestly feel like the drug never kicked in. I was taking 20mg 2x a day and nothing. I cannot wait to go back to Ritalin.",badadd2
2,Adderall,ADHD,,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 15, 2022",1,"Lannett is horrible. Good to see so many agree. My CVS and Walgreens claim its the only mfg they can get. This is just wrong. Sandoz was by far the best. My pharmacist would order it for me, now it's only Lannett! To expect a patient to accept what they're given, without choice, is absurd. If ALL of us contact FDA they may pay attention. AND(!) each state, or region, has a FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator.The form looks daunting but not that difficult. Google fda consumer complaint form and go from thereStrength in numbers! We can sit around and complain, but that is not going to make the change. Good luck!",Jeristert

ADHD diagnosed @9 went through all and adhd med up till 16, I didn't  like them all. Stayed on each one like 1-3 days tops. Fast forward to age 16 a girl @summer job saw me keep forgetting things tablets etc. She suggested I try adderall as she takes it and it works. So me clueless of the med I asked my Dr and she starts me on 20 IR and 10 IR and Wow I couldn’t believe the focus and motivation.  Long story short I become nasty and violent to my family no longer the loving ,caring funny person I was, so Dr blamed it on the crash so he increase it from 20mg 2x to 30 IR 2x. & WOW the Euphoria I had at 16 still sticks to me today at 21. The dose I was on was maximum adult dose I was 5ft 7 120 pounds. Mom was crying @dr visit telling dr I was changing but  the doctor wanted to keep me on it. So she stopped it. Never felt the same since. Today @21 years old I flashbacks of the euphoria I had. Restarted med @18 was in shock how weak teva became tried Sandoz and wow but not as good as 2016.",13 Rehabs l8ter

I’ve fallen asleep twice during the day since I filled it, and my watch says my heart rate is low too. Usually it is normal. I have made no changes to anything. What is going on?? Can we do anything or do we just have to deal with it. Teva has always been decent, actually I don’t even notice generic brands until now and I realized I’ve been getting Lannett until this refill.

After 16 years taking this, I’ve never had a problem with a generic brand (aside from Aurolife aka Aurobindo aka Northstar). I had no problem with Lannett unlike others here. I’m falling asleep after I take it. I took an old Lannett I still had and I’m back to normal. This is extremely frustrating; there’s nothing we can do about it.",Teva 2022

All in all it was solid, I felt it did have a sedative effect which I don't know how that's possible?! The next month I decided to try a different Manufacturer called Lannett, this worked the same without the sedation. Again, very helpful. This medicine helps me to focus IN on what I have to do throughout the day, especially at work, I am able to multi task so much better! The following month I had a different Manufacturer TEVA. A terrible generic as the only thing this RX allowed me to do is STARE OUT! Compared to focusing In? I apologize for not being clinical here, but I'm sure others can relate! TEVA should not be allowed in the same drug class! LANNETT & SANDOZ ARE GREAT!",ADD2PENNIES83

It definitely helps me get through my work day more positively as it does stimulate me like a good cup of coffee with out the side effects afterward. XR didn't seem to last all day so my dr. added IR mid day and this keeps me going. I'm able sleep fine. What I like most is that it helps to lift me depression and mood even if it's for a short while as I also have Bi polar 2 and my antidepressant doesn't seem to give the drive I need.Each day on Adderall is a little different for me depending on my mood and mindset but overall seems to be a great addition to my treatment.Best effects for me.

13,Adderall,ADHD,9.0,,"December 27, 2021",1,"It is not the drug for some people. Now not everyone who has a neurological disorder should take adderall, but the people who do need it thrive from it. It is not the drug. It is the prescription directions and the lack of knowledge of different types of people with neuro problems and how their natural chemicals react to certain stimulants that drs still don't fully understand. I need adderall to function. I'm on 20mg XR. When I'm not on it I can't function. That was  my whole life without medicine and living with severe ADHD; I only know 2 modes, I'm calm and productive, I can have a monster to wake me up and I can get back to work more functionally 'or' oh hey every single thing I shouldn't be worrying about is in my head. Why am I so awake it is night? Why am I so tired at work? I slept 12 hrs?!'

15,Adderall,ADHD,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 2, 2021",7,"This medication can make your life significantly better or completely ruin it. You have to be very self aware when taking it. The main problem I have faced is the detrimental side effect of weight loss. I am currently on 20 mg pills, taking one twice a day. I am a 18 year old girl who was around 115 lbs,  and since I started taking adderall, my weight has dropped to 90 lbs. I am also anemic and have really low iron as a result. I am currently struggling with my health and weight, and I am at my physical and emotional lowest I have ever ever been. Be warned that your appetite will be suppressed for a good amount of the day, so eating before you take it and after it wears off is crucial. Overall, maintaining a healthy and consistent meal plan everyday is SO important when taking this medication. Please be safe and smart with it!

However, I agree with many others, that the generic manufacturer of this drug does matter. I suggest speaking to your neuro or psych doc about these concerns. Also, I had my pharmacist order my Adderall from a specific generic manufacturer, or have the doc write a script for brand-name. This medication isn't for everyone and shouldn't be used by everyone. It is not a study aid, or a 'help you to work longer, faster' aid. It is a helpful, often necessary tool, for use by neurodivergents. Adderall helps give control over my ADHD experience.",Robimat1

Started at 20mg, then tried 40mg, and finally 60mg today and only noticed a slight quieting for my racing thoughts (but it could've been some brain fog since they still were pretty bad), still felt restless, etc.  Came on here to see others experiences and saw that Lannett was a really bad generic manufacturer and so I went to check my prescription and BOOM Lannett.  Knowing that this mfr has been garbage across the board with people has at least been comforting and gives me hope for the next medication attempt (which I will be making sure my psychiatrist puts the name of an authorized generic and that it must be from that mfr)",Cap7070

21,Adderall,ADHD,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 28, 2021",4,"I just started a log of the different versions of generic Adderall I'm taking. The reviews posted prior to this seemed to resonate with my experience. I just now realized that the drug/pharmaceutical industry seems A LOT like the hotel business (build, own short term, file bankruptcy/transfer/buy out/change holding companies & so on). That was definitely new to me. Now that I'm tracking my meds, I'll update this in the future. For now I can say that from about 2018 to 2020 I was taking 30mg TEVA from Walgreens. TEVA b974 oval peach worked like clockwork. My dumb butt switched elsewhere because of a cheaper price & because I was getting fed up with the inconsistent refill dates at Walgreens. Anyways, when I moved, I switched to generic focalin. Just switched back to generic Adderall from Harris teeter for the past 2 months. 1st month=ZYDUS N 956 oval peach (these were soft, chalky, & sucked). 2nd month=SUNRISE N35 round peach (3rd day in but I think I like these things... So far).",Juiceman

Don't get scared off by all the bad reviews, I feel for those people, and I'm sorry they had a bad experience, and I hope they have a good medicine that works best for them now, but not everyone has bad experiences. It helps me focus, and actually HELPS me socially, to interact better with people, feel more confident, listen better, but most importantly, impulse control, to slow down and think before I speak, I don't feel jittery on it at all. It helps me relax, and take better control of my thoughts, and think clearly. I have anxiety, and Adderall helps me feel a lot less anxious too!",EF123

I have tried a number of generics and have never had any issues until now. Save yourself the grief and avoid Mallinckrodt's generic Adderall.

24,Adderall,ADHD,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 30, 2021",14,"There is so much misinformation and fear mongering about Adderall, so I am going to share my personal experience as someone with ADHD who has taken Adderall for years.    When I was 18 and in college, I sought treatment for ADHD and was initially put on Concerta, which is time released Ritalin (methylphenidate).  I didn't like the way the Concerta made me feel.  I felt like a zombie.  I could just stare at the wall for hours without blinking or talking to anyone.  It was a horrible experience.  I went back to see my doctor and he prescribed Adderall which is an amphetamine based drug.  The difference between the two drugs was like night and day.  It was like putting on glasses for the first time in my life.  The Adderall didn’t make me a zombie and I was able to focus without distracting thoughts.  Work became easier to manage.  Studying wasn’t a battle for me anymore.  My quality of life improved significantly.  I have taken Adderall for a long time and I’m not turning to meth.",Michael

26,Adderall,ADHD,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 16, 2021",6,"Adderall can be a game changer for those of us who have always struggled with Chronic Fatigue/Daydreaming/Depression/anxiety etc.... BUT, ONLY IF YOU TAKE IT WITH DISCIPLINE.While taking Adderall, these points will come in handy:1) Go to bed at the same time everyday.2) Wake up at the same time everyday.3) Take Adderall in the same dose(s) at the same time(s) everyday (Or giving, weekends as drug holidays to avoid developing tolerance to it.)4) Eat like a gym pro. Eat a disciplined diet taking medium portions of food at the same time everyday. Eating frequently during the day will only help you to be more productive.5) Avoid Cigarettes and alcohol. Nicotine could make the Adderall last longer than its natural process eventually stopping you from sleeping deep enough and you need 6-8 hours of quality sleep for it to continue to help you. 6) You can ask your doc for Ativan etc. to deal with Adderall tapering off depression in the evening.",Whizbang1111

I typically take 10mg when my alarm goes off. Then another 10mg about 20 mins later. I’ve been getting my scripts from Costco, which carries the Alvogen brand. I recently (2 months ago) switched to Kroger since it was closer. A few days after starting my new bottle from Kroger, I. was. dragging.  It’s taken me 6 weeks to actually get around to researching this, but Kroger carries the Teva brand (which everyone raves about). I don’t see why it’s the preferred brand! I’m literally taking up to 40mg a day now, where I was maybe having to take an additional 10 mg in the afternoon on Alvogen. And I CANNOT make it through the afternoon!

28,Adderall,ADHD,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 22, 2021",3,Adderall is the most dangerous drug on the market. I started taking it at 22 years old. I was taking 3 5mg pills a day as prescribed. Initially I lost 10 pounds and I enjoyed the focus it caused. Then I started to notice I was craving smoking and drinking alcohol more. I began behaving very differently and w time it effected my life and relationships. I started breaking out and was constantly in a state of fight or flight. I was addicted to the drug after a few months on it and didn’t get off it till I was around 27. I believe it rewired my brain and caused me extreme health issues. I have extreme health issues now- mainly with my adrenal glands which are vital organs in your body. My sister also used the drug in her early 20’s and she did not have physical health issues- unfortunately she had mental issues and became a paranoid schizophrenic. I’m writing this to say please be careful with this drug it is very dangerous and they will not tell you that.,Aaliyah

Second month, the nightmare began with refill. Not sleeping and when I finally do, wake with crippling headaches, intense uncomfortable hunger, not to mention it stopped working completely! This drug is toxic IMO and I can't even imagine the generic fillers that are being used in this drug causing these horrible problems, not to mention where the company purchases their generic fillers. In process of changing to Teva brand by Monday. This stuff is junk, and due to incompetence of a pharmacy this could have been remedied over 3 weeks ago.

31,Adderall,ADHD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 16, 2021",3,"I have had ADD for a really long time. I am a creative and always have so many ideas that I sometimes bury myself in them. It affects my ability to pay attention to teachers and life. I began abusing Meth when I was really young and in a lot of ways it was helpful but the dark aspects of it almost destroyed my life. I felt like doctors were always quick to give me an SSRI and send me on my way but they wouldn't ever listen to my needs without labeling me as drug seeking behavior. I understand there are protocols but anyway I finally have my own adderall and it has solved my issues with meth and with my ADD. Meth is a huge problem in USA and it is nobodies fault, so don't for a second think that I am against any users because I get it. Luckily, for me, finding something that is more controlled, regulated and safe has really been beneficial to me.

Ended up with some acute OCD do to some other factors. Switched back to TEVA and I'm instantly clearer. Whatever FDA regulations they have controlling this product are either wrong or being ignored. There is a difference between what is supposed to be and what is sometimes; and this is one of those times. I take 30mg twice a day. I always wake up an hour early and take it then go back to sleep so I wake up naturally. With ALV it would 4 hours later instead 45min later.

45,Adderall,ADHD,,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 8, 2021",167,"Generic Adderall varies significantly depending on mfg. Reason being, the FDA says the mfg only has to demonstrate it works in the same way  as the brand-name. i.e. generic ingredients do Not have to be same which is why so many don’t work and/or make people feel sick. My experience, the only generic that works like the brand-name is Prasco, which acquired Teva’s generic xr in 2016. Few pharmacies use Prasco as their generic because it’s more expensive!  My Dr specifies Prasco generic only on my prescription for D-Amphetamine ER 30MG Salt combo. By law, the pharmacy must comply if Prasco is one of their overall suppliers. My insurance changed so I called Prasco to see if they sell to Costco. They do. Just takes a day or 2 for the pharmacist to order and fill my script.

Yes, fixes concentration problems, makes you feel functional, driven, capable, great...but see more side effects like (super high blood pressure, low libido, binge eating when off medicines, moody/short temper). Worried about long term impacts on health - not being able to quit, sex life and inability to take it while pregnant/nursing.  Would love to hear from long time users in their 30s.
