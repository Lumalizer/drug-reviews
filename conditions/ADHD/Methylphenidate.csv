2,Methylphenidate,ADHD,7.0,,"March 21, 2022",0,"Concerta (methylphenidate):Trying this for the first time at 45 years old. Lifetime ADHD diagnosed in first grade. Found that symptoms that were mostly manageable gotten much worse at midlife with the demands of parenting, accumulative trauma, demanding work situation. Start it off at 18mg and definitely felt more alert and a bit of a fog clearing. Moved up to 36mg and definitely noticed it was a little harder to go to bed at night because of the activating effects. Side effects were a little bit more anxious dreams and definitely noticing once I started an activity whatever it was it was hard to stop and switch gears, so hyper focusing on whatever I was doing; talking, working, eating, household chores.I am mostly writing this review to put it out there that you cannot drink alcohol on Concerta. This was not shared with me and I became extremely physically sick for two days with symptoms of alcohol poisoning after drinking one beer. Please be super careful about this!",June

4,Methylphenidate,ADHD,7.0,,"March 12, 2022",0,"It is effective for controllably managing executive deficits related to prioritizing proactively, persistent drowsiness, avolition, selective attention, processing speed, working memory, sustained attention (i.e. delays onset of mental fatigue, becoming distracted or falling into a state of perseveration). Likewise, I experienced a highly unfavorable effect on mood that gradually worsened the longer I took the medication. These included a lack of ability to derive pleasure out of the usual stimuli (anhedonia), decreased level of emotional expressivity, reduced suggestibility and amiability, a blunted feeling of intrigue or excitement by the prospect of reward, where, together these contributed to secondary feelings of irritability, melancholia and mild dysphoria.

5,Methylphenidate,ADHD,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 3, 2022",0,"Ritalin-SR (methylphenidate):I have tried dexedrine spansules and the IR tablets. They worked well, maybe too well and although it gave me almost no side effects the thought of long term amphetamine usage made me seek an alternative. I tried most methylphenidate products available and found IME concerta and biphentin (once a day) were too long lasting and took 2 hours to work. The crash was also terrible so I was tried on Ritalin SR with a 10 mg IR booster at night. I have tried Ritalin IR (which was the most effective) but it wears off (for me) in 2.5 hours so even with three doses a day I'd only get 6-8 hours of relief. Tried strattera and found it be good for atypical depression and it mildly helped my ADHD but with more side effects than the stimulants. Lastly comes bupropion and I was tried on it for a few months and it did not help my ADHD but made me more anxious and my mind was not focused.

Despite them both being methylphenidate, Concerta felt like a very different drug. The side effects were significantly worse - I had terrible headaches (though I’ve heard that can be mitigated by drinking a lot of water while on it), as well as worrying cardiovascular issues and strangely the drug was really inconsistent. One day it would be somewhat effective, the next day it would give me really bad anxiety that made it difficult to focus, etc. I wasn’t taking any other medication that could have interacted with Concerta, so I have no idea what was causing such varying reactions. Even after discontinuing use, I still have some cardiovascular issues from this drug. Tread with caution!

I started on 10mg of generic Ritalin four days ago.  This is the closest thing to a real miracle that I have ever experienced.  For my ENTIRE LIFE I believed that I suffered from major depression and social anxiety disorder.  Every last thing in life was difficult.  My memory was terrible - forgetting every single day what I was talking about mid-sentence, forgetting why I went into rooms, forgetting goals that I had set just a day or two prior.   Years of undiagnosed and untreated ADHD left me with a nervous breakdown and unemployed (after a 23 year, very STRESSFUL, career as a public school teacher).  I never thought I would ever work again.  That was almost two years ago.

Children have innately low attention levels, it is 100% normal. The vast majority of people either grow out of this or learn to cope with it without any trouble. I was 12 years old when I was prescribed this drug. I took it for two years before switching to adderall, a very similar medication that is extremely closely related to methamphetamine. I am now 28, and rely on this medication and my tolerance is 3 times the amount I am prescribed, which is the maximum dosage allowed. Please heed this advice parents. My grades improved drastically at first. Then I rapidly developed a serious pill problem and it has caused an unbelieveable amount of harm and damage to my life.

I don't have as many bad days like I was having before. I still get them but they seem to be more mild and less often.

My psychiatrist suggested I try Ritalin at a low dose to see if it helped. I finally agreed because I wondered if my ADD was causing most of my psychological issues. At first Ritalin was only a little helpful. I still had to get used to using a stimulant, but after a couple months when my body became accustomed to it, I found I needed my dose to be increased, and the higher it was increased the less I needed other antidepressants or anxiety medication like Xanax. I took Xanax for years and it never solved my psychological problems only bandaided them. Ritalin actually gave me control over my thoughts and emotions and took away all my fears. I need a fairly high dose of it (80mg per day) for it to work at its best but I no longer need Xanax.",Chris

After spending years trying to stabilize my condition I faced with a choice: either drop out of college bc I couldnt keep up or risk going manic by trying an ADHD med. It took months for my doctor to agree to give me something, anything, for my ADHD because the risks were too high, but she finally did.

I've been trying to find the right stimulant with bearable side effects since I was in high school. Please excuse the lengthy review I just know the search can be tough and long. I have Depression, ADD, GA & SA, and OCD skin(cuticle) picking tendencies. It's been very hard finding a stimulant that didn't worsen my anxiety related symptoms. I could tolerate 5mg adderrall XR but my body burned through both the XR and IR in about 3 hours. Then I would crash for the rest of the day (depressed, irritable, anxious).  Vyvanse gave me zero motivation and made me calm but in a weird way. For example, I didn't care or worry about anything... I didn't even want to talk to people. I would just want to sit there alone and stare at a wall or something. It was nice to be that relax but too weird. But the real problem was the crash! It was the most extreme of all the stimulants I've tried by far! I took it only twice and threw it out. I almost didn't try Daytrana patch because Ritalin was actually the first stimulant I tried, which was over 10 years ago and I remember similar symptoms to that I had on adderrall. I ended up giving it a try with the logic that it might be smoother since its was for children and I was also desperate since I'm working and study for the GRE. I'm so happy I gave Daytrana a shot!! I'm telling you if you suffer from anxiety, can't tolerate the crashes, and metabolize the other stimulant too fast you have got to try this one!! I've only been on it for a week but I can't believe it! I leave it in for the whole 9 hours and I never crash. In comparison to Adderall is still the best stimulant for getting you motivated, I have to motivate myself a little but unlike adderall I can stay focused ALL day with Daytrana. Im also less likely to do something ""stimulanty"" like start reorganizing my closet for no reason but I do get the necessary cleaning, errands, bills etc done effortlessly. And the best part is that it doubles as an anti-depressant since, what I assume is the increased dopamine stays in my system pretty much all day and night. The ""happiness"" doesn't feel like a high it feels more like an absence of depression. I don't have anymore of the repetitive negative thoughts. The constant emotions of hopelessness, guilt, embarrassment, you name it, just aren't there anymore. There is still a mild degree of sadness I carry with me but I have major depression so I feel like it's only normal and I can handle that :)!! As far as the negative side effects: Like all the stimulants I've been on I still have the insomnia, loss of appetite, and increase urge to pick at my cuticles at night when it's wearing off. But there is not a ""crash"". no evenings being completely drained of energy, fits of irritation, major anxiety or depression. Also, the patch is applied to your hip and I'm experiencing some muscle tension in my legs which I think might be slowly subsiding. Im drinking a lot of water and taking vitamins in precaution of cramps.  Advice on taking the patch off- It's easier for me to take it off when it's wet.

As soon as this came out, we switched him to Quillivant and he's had great success in managing his ADHD during the day. He starts having trouble at school around 1pm, so it does wear off somewhat, but overall we have been impressed with this medication.

It helps low energy depression and works well with most SSRIs and some low dose SNRIs.  Life feels exciting again and it offsets SSRI sexual side effects.  Works fast and well.  Main problem is that it wears off in a few hours so you need to dose multiple times a day.  It causes you to sweat a little more and be a little more irritable than usual but it is really a great med to help depression.  It is much different and better than Wellbutrin for sure even though both are NDRI's.  Check out the research on stimulants for depression and bipolar depression.

The patch works well for him, no side effects observed and hopefully we keep him on the lowest dose available.",Anonymous

Has enabled my youngest to concentrate in class but has caused urinary (urgency) symptoms which the doctor claims are unrelated.
