0,Atomoxetine,ADHD,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 22, 2022",1,"Strattera (atomoxetine):Strattera almost ruined my life. First of all, it didn't help my severe ADHD at all. It caused me to have severe nausea every day, dizziness,  insomnia every night and it caused severe aggression and mood changes on just 40 mg for two months. The first day my doctor moved me up to 80 mg it sent me into an induced psychosis state where I wound up fracturing my foot and dislocating my finger so bad that I may have to have surgery. I've been in a splint for almost two months now since that horrible night and scariest part of all is I don't even remember how it happened. It literally caused me to go insane. This drug was the worst drug I've ever taken and it even warns you on the bottle ""Warning: May cause mood changes"" boy, what an understatement. This medication made me so angry all the time. What they don't tell you about this medication is it can cause induced psychosis and violent behavior. It states that on the FDA website. I was only on straterra for two month's! Very dangerous drug!",Anonymous

I started noticing flat affect and low mood at around this time and at week 7 I'm going off of it. it feels like I'm totally removed/disconnected from social situations and nothing is funny/interesting to me. It seems to have made me more depressed than when I started simply because I don't feel present. Also has given me major fatigue.

Mine is a somewhat particular path I have moved a lot with my family between US and Europe.  I speak 3 languages, I managed to go to university to pass admission tests to the HTZ in Zurich (third best university in the world), and I graduated with excellent results (as a construction engineer), I lead my life perfectly. The drug never gave me problems except that it helped me study when I was in middle school, and high school.  However my doctor has opted to reduce the dosage of the drug over the years to help me snap from this.  I sincerely thank who I am now and what I was able to do thanks to this drug.

I've always struggled with both of those conditions and finally decided to ask the doctor for help. At first I was on 25mg twice a day. After 4 weeks I didn't feel any different and only had dry mouth as a symptom. My doctor upped my dose to 40mg twice a day and after 3-4 weeks on that dose, one day I realized I felt so much better. I felt so calm, like I had just meditated but all the time. When there was a chore I needed to do like cleaning dishes I just did it, no thinking required. My nighttime routine took me less than 10 minutes when it usually takes an hour. Everything was suddenly so crisp and clear like the fog I was used to living my life in was just gone. When I had to assign my intern something, instead of feeling super anxious and needing to psych myself up for it like I had the previous week, I just was able to do it.

I have had bad luck with mental health medications & providers in the past, so until about 9 months ago, I was self-treating with alcohol. Because I was honest about that, my current psych med provider refused to treat my ADHD with anything but Strattera. It turned out to be a disaster. I started out on 25mg, then he upped it to 40mg, and then to 80mg. After two days on 80mg, I started having heart palpitations & ended up in urgent care.

I was incredibly focused, my mind was able to process things easier, I had barely any anxiety, all around the first day felt like a breeze. No stress at all. Felt like an entirely different person. I felt like this for the majority of the 23 days I was on this medication. The negatives to this drug were it made my insomnia even worse and I eventually broke out in hives!

Was prescribed a non stimulant because I go to a government funded clinic that doesn't give out stimulants due to drug abuse in the area. I personally think this doesn't stop our high addiction rates, people will always get their fixes, but instead just makes it harder for people that need it to get the help they need.First you have take it after a meal to avoid the violent nausea. I'm a very spotty eater and in the morning I don't want to eat at all but that's the best time to take it to get any benefit with such a short halflife. So I compromised and do it at lunch, still no real benefits. The medicine's short halflife gets absorbed by anything used to mitigate or fight its effects: sleeping to counteract the drowsiness, food to combat the nausea, battling through nausea is near impossible or exhausting so its benefits are wasted.",Kay

This drug did very little to help me but had painful side effects which never improved over the 2 months I took atomoxetine. For the first few days, I had painful constipation causing bleeding and hemorrhoids. Urination is slow and painful and often followed by involuntary, even more painful semen discharge.  Around the same time every day, my testes would painfully swell up making all movement difficult. Meanwhile, I noticed no difference to my executive function, racing thoughts, inability to focus, or hyperactive muscles.On the positive side, I noticed a pleasant change to my overall mood, including improvements to my temper and anxiety. The change was noticeable enough that I was willing to continue taking the medication despite my painful side effects, although after an additional month with no positive difference I could no longer bring myself to continue.",Nick

Strattera worked for about a month and a half on 50mg before i had to go up to 100mg due to the medication not working anymore. Once on 100mg a day, it did little to help me get everyday tasks done and on top of that it came with terrible irritability and insomnia. As someone with bipolar disorder, this medication only extrapolated my mood swings. I’m now off of the medication after 6 months and taking Lamictal to treat the bipolar symptoms that I feel Strattera made worse. In my opinion, Strattera could work for an individual but personally I absolutely could not get over the side effects. The increased heart rate from the medication also caused regular fatigue and chest pains. I let out an audible sigh of relief when my psychiatrist told me I should stop taking the medication. I definitely would not recommend Strattera.",bingobutslow

I mean, here I am writing a review on it when I'm supposed to be doing university work. I think I noticed an slight improvement after a few weeks, but lately I have been very stressed, so maybe that is negating the benefits of the Strattera. The only side effects I have had were nausea in the first week, and random chills during the first week as well. Both are long gone now. I also have been having trouble sleeping, but I'm not sure if it is from the Strattera, because I've had some good nights of sleep here and there. I also think that Strattera has helped improve my anxiety a bit along with my Viibryd. I might increase to 40mg soon. If my sleep gets worse, then I'll know it is from Strattera. I'll keep taking it and see how I feel.

These range from mental, including depression, to physical, including but not limited to erectile dysfunction, body aches, and severely inhibited ability to exercise (I am a long-distance runner in good physical shape on days when I did not take Strattera).However, by far the worst aspect of this drug for me has been the horrible fatigue.

I’ve assumed I’ve had it my entire life but regardless my wife begged me to try something. So my doctor recommended trying this first before a stimulant because of my high blood pressure. The only thing I feel has improved is maybe my anxiety and my potential to feel a little low. But I feel like I don’t enjoy things as much and my implulsiveness hasn’t improved nor my focus. I’m tired all the time now but I cannot sleep. When I do get to sleep it’s never a deep sleep I always wake up at 2am and can never go back to sleep. I’m on 40mg I’ve tried taking it in the morning and at night. When I do sleep I get extremely vivid dreams and nightmares. So I was really hoping this would work but I’m back to the doctor next week to see what she says. It seems like it ether works really well for you or it’s a complete disaster.,Chase Fresno

I recommend eating lightly with it and make sure you drink water so your stomach acid isn’t going toe to toe with extended release. You may vomit if you don’t take it with a little food.

These side effects were not able to be relieved with painkillers, eating or drinking. Then my dosage was increased to 40mg. I was now experiencing insomnia, an extreme heart rate and would often nearly faint when I stand up for too long or too quickly. I also started to experience depression and suicidal thoughts. I had my dosage decreased to 10mg but the side effects persisted, only to a lesser extent. Whenever I come off the drug, I immediately feel better. To anyone reading; I spent 3 months well aware of the side effects and common negative reaction because I desperately wanted it to work and to be one of the few that seem to get positive effects, but this did not work out and it caused a lot of unnecessary grief in my life in the past few months.

175,Atomoxetine,ADHD,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 19, 2019",6,"I've been taking atomoxetine 80mg for 8 weeks for ADHD and here is my review: I noticed very slight improvements in controlling racing and intrusive thoughts - only slightly. This medicine does take a while to achieve maximum effectiveness, but I'm still at level 1.  I sleep way more on this drug than off. For example, after 20-30 minutes of taking 80 mg on an empty stomach, I fall asleep for up to two hours.   I do feel somewhat calmer and able to slow down to actually listen to to people. I don't get upset and frustrated like I did before, but my focus is pretty much the same. I still haven't done anything remarkable.  In other words, atomoxetine is good at taking some of the tension away, but nothing for focusing thoughts. It works great for some people; I wish I was one of them.  I am going to try a stimulant, like Adderall. I don't need to sleep all day anymore.",Meh

This medicine takes 4-6 weeks to fully go into effect and I will be waiting till then to see how it goes. Medicine works differently on everyone, so while some people think it's awful, others may think it's the best thing that's ever happened to them. If your doctor prescribes it, I suggest taking it and waiting till the 4-6 week mark unless it makes you physically ill, and even then I would give it a week or two to see if it goes away. This kind of thing is normally hit or miss and you might have to go through a few meds before you find one that is right for you.

At the end of the day I may only have 8 things of the 10 done but they are complete. The only side effect I had was some very bad vertigo which strangely enough seemed to lessen as the dosage went up. May be due to tolerance.",C-Rod

I am no longer on an emotional roller coaster and definitely more patient and no where as near irritable as I used to be. I'm on a dosage of 120 mg daily. I take it at night before I sleep. However, a possible side effect for me is hypothyroidism - but, I did have hyperthyroidism as a child so I don't know if Strattera caused it to come back as hypo or it's because of my age. I did unfortunately gain considerable weight, but with the thyroid pills, I have been slowly losing it again.",Anonymous

My biggest problem was that it caused erectile dysfunction and a strange lack of sensation in my prostate area, even at low dosage (18 mg/day). It was sufficient to stop use.  I am on Adderall XR now which doesn't do nearly as well.  My doctor is going to try me on some antidepressants as they also influence the norepinephrine levels.

It takes a while before you notice a change in the ability to focus. When earning my 1st degree, I struggled in school, probably all my life. While on Strattera, I could sit and study for hours and not be distracted. I went from struggling to earn C's maybe a B, to Earning A's and maybe a B.
