0,Concerta,ADHD,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 26, 2022",0,"The first day on Concerta was amazing, I was able to focus more on my homework, and felt happy and full of energy, after the first day it still worked but just not as much in terms of focusing on homework, but now I am starting to notice that the comedowns are really bad, just feelings of depression and unhappiness and it doesn't work as well as it did the first day with focusing on homework. It also causes me to hyper focus on things even when they cause me anger or distress. I don't think this is the medication for me but I would recommend giving it a go if recommended by your Psychiatrist.",LHJ
1,Concerta,ADHD,7.0,,"March 21, 2022",0,"Trying this for the first time at 45 years old. Lifetime ADHD diagnosed in first grade. Found that symptoms that were mostly manageable gotten much worse at midlife with the demands of parenting, accumulative trauma, demanding work situation. Start it off at 18mg and definitely felt more alert and a bit of a fog clearing. Moved up to 36mg and definitely noticed it was a little harder to go to bed at night because of the activating effects. Side effects were a little bit more anxious dreams and definitely noticing once I started an activity whatever it was it was hard to stop and switch gears, so hyper focusing on whatever I was doing; talking, working, eating, household chores.I am mostly writing this review to put it out there that you cannot drink alcohol on Concerta. This was not shared with me and I became extremely physically sick for two days with symptoms of alcohol poisoning after drinking one beer. Please be super careful about this!",June

During the pandemic, I started to have depressive thoughts and I failed multiple classes. I have been taking Concerta for approximately 2 weeks now and I feel motivated and focused. I am able to clear my thoughts and to be more positive. I am slowly getting back on track with my studies. I don’t forget appointments and lose things anymore. I feel more happy and optimistic towards the future. However, I experience small side effects such as weight loss and trouble falling asleep.",Rose
3,Concerta,ADHD,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 22, 2022",0,"I was initially prescribed Ritalin, which worked well, but after moving to a country where only Concerta is available for ADHD I had to switch over. Despite them both being methylphenidate, Concerta felt like a very different drug. The side effects were significantly worse - I had terrible headaches (though I’ve heard that can be mitigated by drinking a lot of water while on it), as well as worrying cardiovascular issues and strangely the drug was really inconsistent. One day it would be somewhat effective, the next day it would give me really bad anxiety that made it difficult to focus, etc. I wasn’t taking any other medication that could have interacted with Concerta, so I have no idea what was causing such varying reactions. Even after discontinuing use, I still have some cardiovascular issues from this drug. Tread with caution! Avoid Concerta unless all other possibilities have been exhausted (other stimulants, neurofeedback, Clonidine/ Guanfacine, etc)",pilkington

I started with 18mg and worked up to 54mg. It was great at first because it got me out of bed. I had been staying in bed for almost 8 hours a day and neglecting all my responsibilities before I started on this medication. Unfortunately, Concerta increased my anxiety and had me experiencing mood swings and suicidal ideation. I definitely think that my brain chemistry is not compatible with it.",Mitski

Concerta has worked for me all these years. Little to no side effects. I don’t see how it could become addicting like they say but maybe I don’t have an addictive personality. I’ve tried going off meds a few times in hopes that I can live life without them but I never see any improvement so now I ALWAYS take it. I definitely recommend.",Maddy

With medication, therapy, mindfulness, exercise never really helping. I still had all of the symptoms. I was finally diagnosed with ADHD after I kept getting recommended videos on them, and I was shocked how I had every symptom they were talking about in the video. After getting diagnosed by my doctor I was put on 18mg of Concerta (potentially upping it to 36mg after my first month, we will see.). But WOW, I have been on this medication for only 1 week, and this is the best I have felt in honestly, forever. My racing thoughts that usually are a mile a minute with 100 tabs opened is finally, quiet. I am able to focus on the task at hand, I have energy to get everything done I need to for the day (school, work, social etc). I genuinely feel this medication has saved my life. Please do not let stigma or the side effects scare you, to me, these minimal side effects are worth having the will to live.",Anon

I got the lowest dosage too. I felt like I was high off cocaine all day and could not sleep when night came until the a.m. whew! Never again.

8,Concerta,ADHD,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 4, 2022",3,"I moved to Concerta from IR Ritalin after needing a much higher dose than Australia's 5mg tablets could provide. At my highest dose I was taking two 54mg tabs (108mg / day) and whilst I felt at the time it was working well, it was only when I tried out just taking 1 tab I realised how overmedicated I had been. I love Concerta and even came back after a few weeks of trying dexamphetamine. Finding the correct dose is critical however, with both too low and too high a dose ineffective.To be completely honest, Concerta really did change my professional life and social life. I have the energy now to socialise and I can focus at work and get things done which I just couldn't before.",Anonymous

I have been on 18mg for almost 2 weeks. I noticed a change right from the start. It feels like there is more time in the day, I am more productive, less procrastination, don't feel like staying in bed all day anymore due to being overwhelmed. I also feel more level headed and haven't snapped at my family. However!! I am getting side effects that make me wonder if it is worth it. Some of the side effects I have are nausea, headache, and over all just not feeling great. Kind of like something is ""off"" with me. I also notice becoming more emotional in the evening as the medication leaves my system but not unbearable. The weird thing is; I mostly feel side effects on slow days, and no side effects on days that I have a lot on my mind/lot's to do.",Ali

I’m 24 and I’ve struggled all my life with mental illness, 4 months ago I was diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar II Disorder. Psychiatrist said I had to get the mood balanced from the Bipolar before we could treat the ADHD. Once my mood was stabilized, I started to try some stimulant medications. I tried Adderall 5mg, 10mg. Absolutely awful experience. I had two friends recommend Concerta to me so I requested it from my provider. Was prescribed 18mg and after ONE day.. let me tell you I was feeling like that best self that I knew was there all along. Calm, attentive, and enjoying every passing moment with bliss. It keeps on getting better and I hope it continues to. Going to up my dose next month. If you are struggling with ADHD, try this I feel so amazing I could cry (in the good way), no hassle with multiple doses. I was on the brink of giving up but I gave this a go. Please please try it.

We put him on Vyvance and that had horrible side effects that scared me so badly I took him off and just was like the teachers can just deal with him. Now he’s in 6th grade I’ve decided to try again. They started him out on Concerta er 18mg. It did nothing for him other than make him nauseous. It didn’t help or hurt him other wise. Tomorrow he starts on Focalin Xr 15 mg.

I tried Concerta a few years ago and I hated it.  It made me feel like a zombie.  I would stare off into space, stop talking, and feel like I could sit in the same spot without blinking for hours.  I will say that when I was working, it made me a rockstar but the above mentioned side effects were unbearable. I went back to my doctor a couple weeks later and told him I would no longer take methylphenidate in any form whatsoever.  I had been on amphetamine based stimulants in the past without the zombie effect.  I switched to Adderall IR and Vyvanse and I have found benefit without the getting rid of my personality and zombie like effects that methylphenidate caused me.  If you have similar symptoms after taking Concerta, ask about amphetamine based stimulants instead.  The difference for me is night and day.",Michael
16,Concerta,ADHD,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 7, 2021",1,"Concerta is the first ADHD med that I tried and I only could handle one day. I have anxiety disorder so I was hoping that the smallest dose (18mg) wouldn't give me increased anxiety. Concerta worked really well for my ADHD and I actually felt calm and clear-headed when it was in my system. But after a few hours, my heart would start to race and I would feel really nervous like I had a lot of coffee. When the medication wore off (which was about 8 hours for me) I felt HORRIBLE anxiety. I also felt moody and depressed. I suppose this was a rebound effect for me. At bedtime, I was so exhausted but I couldn't sleep at all, like I involuntarily pulled an all-nighter. It was a terrible night for me. I'm giving it 3 stars because it did essentially eradicate my ADHD while it was in my system, but it just was too strong for me with my anxiety I guess.",Anonymous

Tapering off was a whole other story that actually landed me in the emergency department I was so mentally unstable. I’m not anti medication at all, but these drugs are absolute band aid cover ups for something that can be managed in many other ways. A high protein diet, proper cardio, routine, sleep, dietary supplements, THERAPY!! have all helped my learn to live and even excel without stimulant meds.

I can read without forgetting, I can watch movies now without moving a thousand times or pulling my phone out, also I can pay attention to audio books. The downside are the side effects. I burn through this in 6 hours max, I get a headache, dry mouth, increased heart rate, and bad nausea if not eaten with a meal.

Before starting this medication I felt miserable always anxious had poor nutrition and always forgetting to drink water. I've been on adderall vyvanse and focalin but they did not help me. Once I started concerta my anxiety was gone I felt happy and started eating healthy and remembering to take care of my self. I am on 18mg and feel this low dose does me wonders. If your skeptical about trying this medicine because your afraid it's a stimulant I'd like to say I was the same way but it truly has helped me a lot and would recommend this above any other ADHD medication. Also it helps me get a better night sleep and does not affect my appetite, although I have lost some weight on it I consider that a plus because I don't eat less so it's a win win.",Jacky

I can now complete simple everyday tasks without an issue which I really couldn’t manage before, such as cleaning my room, watching TV without turning it off randomly and not being thrown off by background noises.

If you think only taking Concerta will fix you, that is the wrong attitude. You have to make other efforts like counselling, or changing your environment. Concerta changed my life, but it was coupled with a lot of effort to create the right conditions for me. I began waking up early to work in the morning so would not be distracted by anyone or anything. I made sure to eat my three meals a day, even if the drugs suppressed my appetite.

Thankfully, that has lessened a lot and I’ve gained some of the weight back but definitely something to consider if you have concerns about being under weight or disordered eating. As well, if you try to have caffeine, nicotine, sativa, or any stimulants you’re going to feel like absolute garbage, so follow the doctors order and avoid them. Only other warning you might not find online is that the brand name Concerta is expensive and not always covered (in BC, Canada).

His appetite has actually increased! His sleep has not been affected..He actually goes to bed now the first time we tell him to. He will still express that he doesn't feel tired and that he doesn't want to go to bed but when we tell him that he needs to he just goes to his bed without the fighting or trying to do anything else to stop from going to bed.  He is more loving and affectionate now whereas before he was always so defiant. He does cry a bit easier now but it's better than the anger he felt before. He's helpful and considerate and empathetic. We reluctantly gave him this drug and it has saved my marriage and our overall quality of life has improved drastically.

Because of it I've been able to wean off my antidepressant and no longer have to take it. The appetite suppressant does help me out since I'm working on weight loss, but it can also be a struggle to eat at times or find a food that is appetizing in general because of it.

The plus side with this medication is that it works when I have plenty of sleep, and have some sort of workout schedule. But right now being in school, it barely gets me to do my homework. But once I am studying, I can focus. So it does help. But I have zero side affects. The reason I liked Ritalin LA is because I never felt hunger, and the focus was awesome. Concerta is very clean, I react perfectly with it, but we work with what we can.",Biff

Before getting on it I was suffering from depression and I almost dropped out of college due to the number of courses that I had failed, but then I was diagnosed with ADHD and since then, with a dose of  18mg/day  of concerta I managed to graduate. The depression never really went away but it definitely got milder. My panic attacks decreased to the point where I almost never had them anymore. A few years back, my doctor suggested to try taking the 36mg ones, but for me this didn't work because I felt kinda lost and foggy. So all in all concerta did wonders for me until half to one year ago. I have severe insomnia and I get irritated really easily. I had some milder panic attacks but I also had two that were really intense. I have lost weight even though I eat the same.

The best part of Concerta is that it stops my obsessive anxiety. I can control my thoughts now- this is something I was never capable of in the past. It gives me a sense of mental relaxation that I’ve never had, and it’s life changing. I feel on edge, kind of jumpy, and alert, but no uncontrollable anxiety like before. At first, I had some weird side effects, like tics, shakiness, lack of appetite, and peripheral hallucinations, but these side effects are SO worth not having the terrible anxiety like I used to.

Once the medication wears off you become hungry and return to normal. In my opinion, the benefits outweigh the cons.

I got off it when I moved overseas for 8 yrs and now I’m back on it. The first couple weeks are a bit rough, it gives me anxiety and restlessness, it’s an instant laxative, and makes you pretty antisocial. But  remember your body adjusts and you start feeling more normal and less anxiety. However if I take 36mg and have any other stimulant like caffeine, I literally feel like I’m having a heart attack and anxiety attack at the same time.

He is taking it and Strattera both for his condition, and the Strattera worked well for a long time, but when he was prescribed Concerta in addition to this to further help with his symptoms, it was just amazing. His breakdowns and tantrums decreased in number, he started doing his chores and homework again, and he started doing random little things to help other people out. This medication is a controlled substance, so it's harder for him to get than his other medicine-- he has to have an appointment with a specialist every two months to stay on it, though I don't think it's that way for everyone. He was born addicted to the painkillers my mother was on, as he was seven weeks early, and therefore has a higher chance to become addicted to substances in the future, but this does not seem to be a problem so far with Concerta.",Anonymous

At first it was for my ADHD but it also helps with my depression. It makes me feel awake but not jittery and anxious. I feel more social and talkative (I'm very shy and people always make comments on how I don't talk that much). I don't have as many bad days like I was having before. I still get them but they seem to be more mild and less often. There is a slight come down period when it is wearing off and you can get a little bummed during this time.

I have also been diagnosed with major depression and bipolar after years of taking Concerta (diagnosed in 2007 and 2013 respectively (both are genetic in my family)).

Because of my horrible ADHD we decided to give it a chance and its nothing compared to the 'kick in the nuts' Adderall is known for. My grades have improved in school, my mood is slightly elevated and my cavings for sugar have ceased. It has not affected my sleep and so far works great. This is my experience and everyone reacts differently. I highly suggest this medication for anyone like me who has ADHD and possible addiction issues.

He had an excellent school report in every area.  His teachers are thrilled, he is confident and happy and enjoys school. He doesn't take Concerta in the holidays or at weekends and manages fine going back on it on a Monday morning.  Only one side effect which is lack of appetite.

My life did a complete 180.  Once unfocused, unmotivated and disorganized, I transformed to near perfection in everything I did.  The price you pay for perfection - I've lost my friends and my social abilities.  I used to be fun and full of life!  You begin to seclude yourself because you are too focused, too mechanical.  You lose weight because your appetite goes away and you are indeed anorexic.  I couldn't sleep, had extreme anxiety, headaches, dry mouth, highs and lows....I can go on and on.

There were no jobs available, so I decided to go back to school and get a second degree.
