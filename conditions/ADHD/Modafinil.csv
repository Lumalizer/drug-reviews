0,Modafinil,ADHD,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2022",0,"I tried this drug for ADHD as an alternative to methylphenidate because it was causing disturbing side effects. While Modafinil increased my energy and motivation, it made me anxious. This seems like a drug that would do wonders for lethargic depression because it’s simply impossible to spend the day in bed while on Modafinil. But if you have co-morbid anxiety I would tread with caution. I tried experimenting with lower doses and found that with a low dose I would still derive some benefit without the anxiety. Overall, this medication definitely has therapeutic potential for some people with ADHD, though it doesn’t give you the kind of robotic, almost artificial focus that typical ADHD stimulants do in my experience.",pilkington
1,Modafinil,ADHD,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 12, 2021",0,"I begged my doctor for this after taking adderall for my ADHD. I was desperate to get off Adderall, it ruined my life and my brain chemistry. It made me extremely depressed and couldn't function without taking it. Besides just sitting around on the couch watching tv and browsing the internet I just could not bring myself to do anything else. Cleaning the house was like climbing mount everest. Long story short I begged my doc for this to stop the Adderall and I had such high hopes because of all the fantastic reviews and I even know a couple friends it worked great for. Unfortunately besides give me massive diarrhea and headaches it did nothing for me. I took a full 200mg pill and it felt like drinking a bad cup of coffee. It didn't give me the motivation or anything as others raved about. Give a try though! Everyone is different. Good luck!",Jas223
2,Modafinil,ADHD,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 8, 2021",0,"When I found modafinil, I had the best couple months of my life. I felt confident and focused; for the first time, I was able to put my mind to something and do it. I felt alert and engaged with the world around me. My mood was even getting better. I no longer felt anxious; I was self-assured, confident, and even a bit cocky.Unfortunately, modafinil is not perfect. Care must be taken to not take it too late, because you will be up far later than you may want to be. Modafinil lets you feel 100% even with just a few hours of sleep, but it WILL catch up to you, and you don't want to be caught in a cycle like that. I also developed tolerance. After the first couple weeks, I was no longer able to take it daily and had to use it every other day at most for it to be effective. Even doubling my dosage didn't help much.Modafinil is great, but it is just a tool and it needs to be used correctly. Don't rely on it to always be there.",Pepper
3,Modafinil,ADHD,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 19, 2021",2,"I love modafinil. As someone without much options for treating adhd, it calms me down and I can focus on existing instead of overthinking. I’m not saying it’s a miracle pill as it’s a hit and miss for many but I feel like it’s better than nothing (with nothing I’m anxious and moody).  I tried armodafinil but I think it’s making me spacey and anxious so I went back to modafinil and it’s great. Worth a go!!",Anonymous
4,Modafinil,ADHD,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 14, 2021",8,"Doctor wanted me to try this before going back on amphetamines after years off of them in my early 20s. At 200mg a day it didn't do anything. Didn't feel side effects thankfully but didn't feel any relief. I have severe ADHD and social anxiety which is helped by amphetamines, so we stopped this and doctor put me back on amphetamines thankfully. I'm glad modafinil works for some but definitely didn't for me.",Maggie
5,Modafinil,ADHD,8.0,,"April 12, 2021",10,"Been on it for a month, 200mg per day. I like it, but definitely not the same person now.- Helped my chronic laziness. - Better focus. Feels very right, very normal. - I can hold coherent conversations with people now.- I can read more than a few lines without my mind drifting. - Confidence boost of sorts.- Makes me extremely jovial and exuberant. - Always had an eccentric and loud personality, but now I have literally no filter or composure and my ability to control or 'hold back' my impulses is worse, and I'll often find myself doing or saying whatever  is on my mind, more often than before. - Hyperactivity is worse.- Attention span is longer now, it's still not long enough to achieve much really. - Forgetfulness and overthinking I'd say is the same.Overall not sure if it's the Modafinil or the placebo effect that is owed more credit here, but works either way.",kitty
6,Modafinil,ADHD,7.0,,"June 8, 2020",24,"As a kid I was on Ritalin, without it I would have flunked. Once I reached my mid 20's the famed ADHD depression kicked in and I spent 10 years on anti-depressants.Work wise I ""grew out"" of my concentration problems, BUT it came back recently and I lost all focus. All I did at work was day dream for months.I code all day, and no this is not a magic pill to motivate you, you don't feel anything. Nothing at all..... BUT, I am sitting down at my desk and I'm typing. I still get distracted with the office chat and I don't get the unrelenting hyper focus others describe, but they helping.My mood is more level, dopamine is dopamine, my mood is neither up or down, or numb. I feel balanced but still like myself.I gave it 7 stars because my appetite vanishes and I get a dry mouth. When the effects subside I grow very hungry very quickly.",DannyDice
7,Modafinil,ADHD,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 14, 2020",40,"For those whose insurance won’t cover Modafinil: Try its prodrug Adrafinil. It’s metabolized into Modafinil in the liver, way cheaper (like $30 a month), classified as a food supplement in the US and unregulated in most countries.I (m, 38) have used both, Modafinil and Adrafinil for my ADD non hyperactive with considerable success. They seem to be interchangeable, but given a choice, I would prefer Modafinil as for me it seems to act faster and puts less of a strain on the liver. I am able to function well on it and it helps me overcome my task initiation blocks. I can stick to a boring task and get it done. It also helps improve my mood. Correct dosage is really important and I did develop tolerance after prolonged use. Taking a break from it for a few days every now and then helped with that. What I don’t like is that it makes my urine smell weird.",Martin

9,Modafinil,ADHD,2.0,,"April 6, 2020",7,"For ADHD and narcolepsy. I took 300 MG a day for several months, hoping some improvement, but nothing, any difference. Even not side effects! Anything",Roro
10,Modafinil,ADHD,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 11, 2019",43,"I took this drug for a month and then stopped because I fell into my seasonal depression and needed some time to relax. Before this drug I took Adderall 30mg a day and eventually it wore me down and I was unwilling to take more. Modafinil came with virtually no negative side effects compared to Adderall. It feels like you are just at ease with whatever it is you want to be doing instead of trying to do things and feeling like you need to find your bed, It feels like the ultimate coffee. I recommend this drug as an alternative to Adderall any day of the week to anyone. It is much less neuro-toxic and has no side effects but yet gives me the mental clarity, focus, and stay up that I need to do what I want. Also people are saying this drug is expensive,I can get coupons and buy it for $35 in generic form. My insurance does want me to pay a lot though,",CJ
11,Modafinil,ADHD,10.0,,"May 9, 2019",134,"My whole life I struggled to with focus, energy and confidence. It took great effort to pay attention and I struggled to complete things. Teachers, family and friends told me I was a daydreamer, an underachiever and lazy. I felt shame that I was not good enough and must just try harder. Then I was prescribed Modafinil at age 40 and was able to focus, had energy and social confidence. When visiting museums I was unable to focus on exhibitions for more than 2 minutes, I now spend a whole days museums reading everything! I've been discriminated for being forgetful, distracted and underachieving. Now I'm succeeding in a new career, communicate effectively and no longer feel shame. Unfortunately here in the U.K. doctors it is so hard to get a prescription. Shouldn't I have the right to a drug which makes me equal to my peers, able to reach my dreams and contribute to society. My greatest fear is access to obtaining it being blocked.",JayR
12,Modafinil,ADHD,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 1, 2019",19,"Since I am unmedicated for ADD, I've been trying several natural nootropics in the past. After reading about Modafinil, I've decided to give it a try. I mostly have problems with concentration and procrastination, and unfortunately, it doesn't work. I know that Modafinil is supposed to keep you awake and focused, but it doesn't help with motivation. Well, the thing is that it's not even keeping me awake. I've been experimenting with several doses, in various situations, I was taking care of not eating or drinking anything that interacts, but most of the time I can take a nap on it. And when it works, it makes me very anxious and irritable, so I can't take things done because of the anxiety. I gave it 5 stars, because some days it helps, kinda, but so far I'm not happy with the results. I think it works, but not for ADD.",BeeBee

14,Modafinil,ADHD,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 17, 2018",13,"I used Provigil for about 6 months off label for ADHD , non hyperactive type. I was trying to find something that wasn’t as strong as the Adderall (60mgs) twice daily. My Psychiatrist had me take one 30mg in the morning and a 100mg of Provigil at lunch time. This was generally when I took the second Adderall. The Adderall was immediate release. It seemed to work, but made me have headaches, neck and shoulder pain, and irritability. After 5 months on this regime I started noticing urinary retentiion. I finally got a UTI and had to go back to the Adderall! It’s a good medication for some people, but it wasn’t for me. Also it’s unbelievably expensive if you don’t have insurance that will pay for this medication, even the generic version.",1Texasbear

Out of bed, no anxiety or very little.  Now doctor thinks I have ADD so was prescribed Adderall.I hate it.  I can't tell how well it's working because of having to cope with the anxiety and crashes it causes.Stopped Adderall and tried modafinil again and feel so much better.I don't know exactly what my condition is beyond PTSD.  But modafinil has been a life saver.  The cost which insurance won't cover Is too high and you do build up a tolerance to it.  You have to stop sometimes to clear your system.If I take a high does it doesnt work, or I feel terrible.I take only 50mg at a time-lasts about 4 hours right now..cuts the cost downNever had withdrawals just some sleepiness.Better Compared to other drugs and the horrible side effects and addiction potential.",Ccr

She mentioned it also might be helpful for my ADHD. I am also prescribed Adzenys (amphetamine) which is great for the cognitive and emotional dysregulation aspects of ADHD, but Modafinil handles other symptoms: overwhelmed mood that results in low energy, anxiety around task initiation, and of course excessive daytime sleepiness. This should be approved for ADHD. And no crash when it wears off!",Catdad
18,Modafinil,ADHD,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 23, 2018",28,"This is an untapped gem for people with ADHD. Yes I take it off label (particularly armodafinil) but it certainly works. Yes you might not feel as energetic as you do if you take adderall.

19,Modafinil,ADHD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 8, 2017",14,"I had been on Concerta in high school for questionable ADHD diagnosis, and it had a VERY minimal benefit. So minimal that after 2 school years it was determined my problem was probably more attributable to being ""smarter than your average bear"" and I just was not being challenged in my non-honours and non-dual credit classes. Made it through Uni and my doctorate degrees OK by overloading my schedule and surviving on coffee and caffeine tabs, taking 18 hr semesters instead of the rec'd 12-15 hrs.Fast forward to a few yrs later, I have been on Adderall for about 4 mo, titrating to the perfect dose of 2×5mg at 8am & 5mg at noon.

Tried one pill in my free days - had no real effect. Later I found a bigger dose had a great effect on my ADD. Dosage matters.

21,Modafinil,ADHD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 7, 2017",140,"This medicine is literally a life changer. For so long I took adderall to get me through the day and to sustain focus during college courses. Adderall gave me severe anxiety and depression and I thought I had lost all hope seeing as that is ""the best"" drug for ADD... WRONG! Modafinil gives you the same level of focus without ANY side effects... no anxiety, no depression, no euphoria (which is great because adderall is very addictive) and minimal weight loss. It has improved my life to the point that my friends and family members have been commenting on how great I sound. I just wanted to share my experience (never have before, but I felt compelled to because this is an emotional topic for me) in case you're nervous about giving it a shot.",There is Hope
22,Modafinil,ADHD,10.0,,"February 11, 2017",75,I started taking this for adhd when I realized that adderall wasn't cutting it anymore. Adderall works for about a year and then starts to become ineffective unless you keep upping your dose. After a year and a half I started searching for alternatives and came across this MIRACLE. It is not prescribed for adhd in the united states so insurance will not cover it for the most part. I have to order it overseas (it is technically illegal to do so in the US but customs only cares about abusive drugs). I really hope some researchers test armodafinil and modafinil for adhd and depression. It has done a lot for me. I highly recommend it.,kat kat

I tried the stimulants and like the way they helped my concentration and focus but I couldn't take them because of my high blood pressure. I've also tried Strattera which worked really well but again I couldn't deal with the side effects (not being able to urinate can be painful). Provigil really helps slow down my racing thoughts but it doesn't seem to help with my concentration or distract ability. I take it first thing in the morning and usually can't get to sleep until midnight or 1.00am. Luckily I work at home so that's not a real problem.

It is a great drug for ADD because it doesn't cause all those nasty side effects other ADD drugs have.
