0,5-hydroxytryptophan,ADHD,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 14, 2020",2,"5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):I am trying 5 HTP now as of today. I have been taking 500 mg of l phenylalanine  for the past few weeks. Overall my mood, focus and attention levels have been optimal thus far.  Thoughts have been more entertaining rather than anxiety stricken. I still get some anxious thoughts and sometimes impatient that's why I am trying to stack 5 htp as well.  I usually even with the phenylalanine have times where it's hard to relax another reason for the 5 htp addition.  But I would definitely  say if you have adhd try phenylalanine you  should see an improvement.",stevo
1,5-hydroxytryptophan,ADHD,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 11, 2019",22,"5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):I am 54 and have ADHD (combination-type). Numerous tests show no anxiety, no stress and no depression. I've been taking 5-HTP for about seven years. 160mg every morning, thirty minutes before food, is my current sweet spot to help with my irritability. It doesn't help me with any other ADHD symptoms, eg. dysfunctional working memory or concentration. If I've had a 15-hour working day, I may have a 100mg dose before retiring, as I feel exhausted the next morning and know that I'll be irritable (stop the world, I want to get off) with everyone who rubs me up the wrong way, until my morning dose kicks in. Only side effect is nausea if I wait more than thirty minutes before eating. Just remember to keep your stock levels sufficient (set a reminder), so that you don't run out and then have the added drama of rushing around to buy some while you're in a bad mood. I buy them from a website in New Zealand, and they arrive in Australia within a few days.",Kitty
