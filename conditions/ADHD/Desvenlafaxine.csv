0,Desvenlafaxine,ADHD,7.0,,"April 2, 2018",11,"I started this medication in Dec of 2017 for anxiety, depression, and ADHD. After a couple of weeks I noticed a huge difference in my mood. It helped me think positive and feel great about myself with no side affects. After a few months however I am back to the same old me...I went from 50 to 100 mg. I guess my body got used to the dosage :/ Oh well. It was nice while it lasted.",It's okay
1,Desvenlafaxine,ADHD,10.0,,"February 11, 2016",32,Wow. Pristiq is AMAZING. I've had severe depression since I was 13/14 and have been on everything under the sun. Nothing has worked as well as Pristiq. The only side effects I have noticed are:1) Increased happiness2) Easier to organize thoughts3) Increased motivation4) Decreased appetite5) Lows aren't as low 6) Less irritable I'm currently looking for something to pair with Pristiq to get my ADHD in check. Hopefully I can find something!,CBeesta
2,Desvenlafaxine,ADHD,,,"December 2, 2010",38,Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):I've been taking Pristiq for 6 months now and I can not believe the change. When you notice it yourself you know it's working. I wake up singing and I haven't done that in a very long time! My focus is back and I'm doing my art again. I am so happy.,Happy!!!
3,Desvenlafaxine,ADHD,9.0,,"December 14, 2009",23,"Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):Was given a prescription to Pristiq to help with ADHD in addition to Xanax for anxiety.  The first day I noticed an improved mood, but initially thought it was the Xanax.  After taking Pristiq first thing in the morning and holding off on the Xanax, I noticed a significant improvement in mood over no medication, and a slight improvement over taking both Pristiq and Xanax.  Between the two of them, they seem to keep my anxiety and focus in a healthy range.  The only side effect I've noticed is slight jaw fatigue from clenching.  Pretty minor though, and something I have no problem dealing with.",provotrout
4,Desvenlafaxine,ADHD,7.0,,"November 25, 2009",37,"Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):I have been taking 100mg every morning for 9 months,with Trileptal 450mg at night and Adderal in am and after lunch. I was so scattered and depressed last January 09 due to a lot of life changes but really all my life I have sabotaged myself living without treatment. These medicines saved my life and I will continue on them as long as they work. Pritiq is good for me. I mistakenly got my dose mixed up when I first started Pristiq and took 200mg. Never felt better but soon found out that it was dangerous and max is 100mg. Whew...must be careful. Life is good today and it can be for you too. I also use the Pristiq discount card and pay half price...really helps.",Napleskt
5,Desvenlafaxine,ADHD,,,"May 7, 2009",32,"Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):What a great antidepressant - No side effects and I actually feel happy. My mood swings have improved and I feel calm and happy inside. Things that used to irritate me, don't anymore. I can tell I have less of an appetite and more energy. I am on 1 x 50 mg a day. If you have had bad luck with side effects and antidepressants, you need to try this. I applaud Pristiq. I've been on it for ten days and am very impressed. I still get anxiety, maybe I'll have to take something else as well. It seems about 50% of people on Pristiq are doing really well (from all the boards I've browsed). ",sadbuddha
