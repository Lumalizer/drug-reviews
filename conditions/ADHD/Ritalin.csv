3,Ritalin,ADHD,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2022",10,"At 48 years old I was diagnosed with severe ADHD/combined.  I started on 10mg of generic Ritalin four days ago.  This is the closest thing to a real miracle that I have ever experienced.  For my ENTIRE LIFE I believed that I suffered from major depression and social anxiety disorder.  Every last thing in life was difficult.  My memory was terrible - forgetting every single day what I was talking about mid-sentence, forgetting why I went into rooms, forgetting goals that I had set just a day or two prior.   Years of undiagnosed and untreated ADHD left me with a nervous breakdown and unemployed (after a 23 year, very STRESSFUL, career as a public school teacher).  I never thought I would ever work again.  That was almost two years ago.  Now that I am on the medication?  1) My anxiety is GONE.  2) My depression is GONE.  3) I can remember what I am doing - whether that be in a task I am performing or in a conversation that I am participating in.  4) I feel calm.

It’s my 6th day taking it and it feels like it’s doing the complete opposite of what it should be doing. It’s worsened my anxiety and depression, I feel robotic and numb, my moods fluctuate more than usual, I can’t focus, I feel tired and lethargic, irritable, nauseous, dizzy, racing heart, and none of my usual coping mechanisms that I had before I started meds are helping at all. It’s helped so little and made me feel so much worse. I've started dreading having to take them. Called my Dr today and waiting for him to call back so I can speak to him about it.",Skye

7,Ritalin,ADHD,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 2, 2022",0,"I took ritalin in elementary to middle school. And I stopped in high school. As I got older, I did my own research and reflected to times when I was prescribed. Funny but no laughing matter. The damn thing made me do what it was supposed to treat. As ritalin was told to me to help treat with my hyper energy and it would keep me calm. When in actuality, I was fidgeting with cracking my knuckles constantly. A poor attitude from being malnourished. And a whole bunch of other things. When in my own honest opinion and defence. I think I was just a kid being a kid. Right? So, in short. It me do the very thing I was told it was to treat. I will, however say that in high school. I remember I found some old pills and I used it for losing weight for some sport and I remember a significant difference to controlling my self and what's around me at a older age then I did at a younger one.",Mieko7me

I take one in a.m with sertraline 100mg as per usual the past year. I.find I am way too relaxed and almost restful minded.

Don't feel like it. I used to walk fast now I walk slow lol. I needed white noise to sleep, now I can just sleep with silence. Hated loud noises and flies but now I don't stress about them.

9,Ritalin,ADHD,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 22, 2021",1,"I had a horrible experience with Ritalin. At first it was fine when it was initially prescribed. I only took it during the weekday or on some weekends when I had grad or teacher word to do. I was prescribed 5 mg.  After a few months of taking it, I noticed my heart was racing; I would initially ignore it. But then it started to get worse and I would get a little more concerned.  I also noticed I was super irritable and would get frustrated easily. Finally, after taking it 3 days in a row coupled with being super stressed about being quarantined and teaching from home, my heart raced super fast. My anxiety was also worse because I was freaking out about my heart rate. I ended up calling 911 and the paramedics wanted to take me to the ER to get further testing done. After a few tests, the cardiology team wanted me to stay overnight.  They wanted to check if I had a heart attack at the age of 32, it was negative.

10,Ritalin,ADHD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 26, 2021",6,"I have taken Adderall for years and made the switch to Ritalin. Adderall just wasn’t cutting it for me and was actually affecting me negatively (it only lasted a couple of hours, and the comedown was terrible. It also affected my ability to think after the affects took place 30 minutes prior). Ritalin may not last as long, but splitting the dose into 3 different times lasts me 10-14 hours. With the Adderall, I would take 20mg twice daily, it affected my appetite which caused it effectiveness to perish. With Ritalin, I take it first thing in the morning, eat about 3 hours later, take the second dose, eat about 4-5 hours later, then take the third dose (I wake up at 7am). It starts to wear off around 6-7 pm, which I’ll then eat dinner and it kind of reactivates it, lasting until it’ll ready for bed (which would be after dinner or 1am, it doesn’t keep me awake like Adderall). Take it 10-15 mins before a meal for max effectiveness. I take 60mg a day, but 40mg is just as effective.",Kaden8597

Freshman and sophomore years were terrible, I was depressed and anxious and had horrible grades. Got on Ritalin during junior year and my grades went up. I was getting straight A's and homework didn't feel like a chore anymore. Ritalin does exactly what it is supposed to do. However, I started to notice after a couple months that the down falls off of the medication made me very irritable and just ticked off and wouldn't want to be near anybody. I feel like that is a very normal feeling with this medication though. I also had a very hard time overcoming the mental barrier of me having to take this medication just to like a normal student and felt it was very unfair that other kids didn't have to go through this, but those were my own issues. In the end, there are negatives to every medication and I just want others to be aware of what I went through and to see if anyone else had similar experiences.",anonymous

My social relations were tense and my behaviour hurt everyone around me.

16,Ritalin,ADHD,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 11, 2021",1,"I'm recently diagnosed with ADHD(ADD). I've tried Ritalin and Dexedrine. Dexedrine is absolutely amazing, but also expensive, and I find that if I don't take a break of 1-2 days per week, it stops working entirely and can even make things (much) worse. I initially didn't like Ritalin as it gave me crazy headaches, hard comedowns, and, on one occasion, anxiety. However, I think this is important: Just because Ritalin isn't great straight away, it doesn't mean it's a bad drug. Over the last few weeks, I've grown very fond of it. I still don't like the LA, but 5 mg IR 2-3 times per day is currently perfect for me, and I now have zero side effects. I feel good, energized, and clear-headed. Ritalin is cheap, and IR is super flexible in terms of dosing. Dexedrine makes me feel even better for longer, but it's pricey and requires breaks. I currently prefer Ritalin for everyday use and Dexedrine perhaps once or twice per week. Best of luck.",Calliope16

I have bad social anxiety I was able to have a conversation with the barber without all of the intrusive thoughts. Which was just amazing for me. But that’s all the good that came from it. By that evening it was clearly worn off. I have sensory processing disorder too and when this wore off it felt like my senses came back with a crash. Everything was way too much. My anxiety was horrible. I called a friend around to come get me cause I was having the worse panic attack ever. And on top of that I kept humming and rocking. I couldn’t seem to control it. I felt absolutely crazy. I took an extra  xanax and was able to relax and calm enough to not feel panicked. So disappointing cause it started out so good.  Hopefully I can find something that quiets my mind without the horrible come down. But I would never take Ritalin again. Absolute nightmare,Nlsr03476

19,Ritalin,ADHD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 27, 2021",23,"(F35) Like many others I went through many different antidepressants and mood stabilizers, even EMT and nothing would help me with depression, lack of attention and energy. When I was finally diagnosed with ADD, I was worry because I am bipolar, that the medicine would make me hypomanic, but quite the opposite, it makes relax, focus, I don't need to spend the afternoon in bed like I used to. I can finally go back to work full time. For me, is best to not take it in the morning when I am more fresh, and wait until I have the afternoon crash, that happens between 12 and 2. I try to do a single dose of 10 mg, unless I have to work after 5, in that case I take the second. I also try to take it only 3 or 4 days a week, to avoid tolerance and become too dependent.

Then I switched to Vyvanse which was a massive mistake and damaged my heart. So now I'm back on ritalin since 2.5 years. My dosage at the beginning was 10-20 mg ritalin/day. It increased over the years to 60-80mg/day. But 2 years ago something weird happened and I got more sensitive to it again. So now I'm back at 20 mg/day and it works great.

After a slew of failed benzos, every class of reuptake inhibitor, and a horrible experience with a low dose antipsychotic, I accepted the ADHD diagnosis, and Ritalin is nothing like I feared it might be. 10mg 2x/daily doesn't give me energy or euphoria, it simply makes me more aware. I have better comprehension skills, move more deliberately, and I don't talk over people. I pay closer attention while driving, haven't even been pulled over for speeding since starting this medication (previously an almost monthly occurrence), I'm patient, and I sleep better. The only side effect I've experienced is drowsiness when it wears off, which is extremely inconvenient mid-day, but that's what calendar reminders are for.

This pill is amazing for organization and for getting tasks done that need to be completed. I have no complaints with this medications regarding how effective it was at treating my ADHD and increasing my focus. The reason that I scored this medication on the lower spectrum is because when I was taking this medicine I would get severe headaches. The headaches would happen 30 minutes into taking the medication. The headaches were not ordinary headaches. It felt as if I was going to have a brain aneurysm.

43,Ritalin,ADHD,1.0,,"June 28, 2019",79,"First off, it was horrible for me. I will never go back to Ritalin ever again. I was on 10mg of Ritalin and it lasted around 2 hours. It was the weirdest experience. I felt simultaneously euphoric, jittery and stimulated, but also lazy and just wanted to sleep (???). It did give me a strong boost of energy which lasted throughout the day.After 2 hours was when things got really bad. I guess this is the 'crash'. It made me horribly depressed, anxious, and filled with rage. The anxiety was so bad that every single thing I set eyes on would trigger me, like looking at the laundry basket filled with laundry. I also felt extremely anti-social and didn't want to talk to anyone, not even my husband. Finally towards the end of the night I would return to my normal self again, but you can imagine the emotional roller-coaster I experienced the entire day.I tried to brush it off and chalked it down to stress.

It causes you to sweat a little more and be a little more irritable than usual but it is really a great med to help depression.  It is much different and better than Wellbutrin for sure even though both are NDRI's.  Check out the research on stimulants for depression and bipolar depression.

140,Ritalin,ADHD,7.0,,"March 11, 2009",67,"I've been on this medicine for about a month and lost around eleven pounds. I initially got on it to stay more focused in school although I don't have a serious case of ADD but I don't mind the weight loss. I could spare a few pounds. You get a rush for about 45 minutes after it kicks in and that feels better than it should. I feel I can concentrate when I use it, but I'm not myself when I take it. My personality is dulled a bit and even if I have homework to do, I'll find something to distract myself. Whether it's choosing a simpler assignment or just writing because I still feel like I'm being productive.",Anonymous
