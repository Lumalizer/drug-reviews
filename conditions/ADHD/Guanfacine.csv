Have issues with hypercalcemia which can cause symptoms of anxiety, confusion, irritability, ADHD,  depression, mood swings, etc. Doctors don't know the reason so I did research and discovered soy is not good for calcium absorption. It seems that a lot of products lately are using soy products ( soybean oils, canola, vegetable oil) canned foods( tuna, chili, hotdogs, beans(soy), processed meat, cookies, sodas, deli meat, etc. Try eating fresh or canned fruits and vegetables and meat( fish, liver, beef, chicken). Not saying diet alone will cure anything nor am I saying to stop meds. I'm just saying try incorporating a soy-free diet for a month or two and see what happens. I am.",Hill8989

2,Guanfacine,ADHD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 4, 2021",2,"I had been on vyvanse and dexedrine for about 5 years. However, I developed an alcohol problem after college, and ended up in long term treatment because of it. The treatment center took me off of my stimulants to pursue non-stimulant medications, one of which was Guanfacine.Even on the starting+intermediate dose(s) I noticed extreme fatigue, and when the dosage was upped after a week I became full on narcoleptic. Falling asleep randomly throughout the day, fatigue so extreme all you can do is sleep, and think about sleep, every waking moment.I tried clonidine as well, and it literally did the same thing to me as guanfacineYMMV but everyone else at the treatment center I was at had the same issue as me with both clonidine and guanfacine.Back on vyvanse now, will never consider non-stimulants for ADHD again",AndrewB

My son, being an active boy and going into high school next year I feel more comfortable with the one tablet and me knowing his taking it.  The first day was good but second he has been very sleepy so we are going to swap to night time dose of 1mg to see if that helps and then after the week to 2mg.

I take 5mg of it in the morning along with three 27mg Concerta pills. When starting Intuniv and ramping up the dose my doctor wanted me at, with each dose increase I'd get the tiredness in the afternoon and the upset stomach in the morning for four or five days after, then it would settle. Intuniv started working for me at 3mg and really really worked at 4mg. 5mg didn't seem as good but I know it takes a while to adjust so I waited. Then I got my period and it was like the Intuniv had suddenly and completely stopped working. It actually seemed to be worse than it was before starting the Intuniv. I haven't experienced my ADHD this strongly since I was a child. I've never experienced a medication so clearly ceasing to function before. It hasn't started up again a few days or so later, so I'm going to be talking to my doctor about it. I may also try going down to 4mg again as that's where it really seemed to work.",Sarah

It has greatly reduced impulsive and sensory seeking behavior. He started with 1mg and worked his way up to 4mg. I read lots of reviews and was so worried about side effects, but the only side effect he had was constipation, which has gone away over time. It does not turn him into a zombie or sedate him. He still has his fun loving personality and plenty of energy to run and play. I will say that after a few months at the 4mg dose it seemed to lose some of its effectiveness, but still much better than without it.",Katherine

Currently I take 20mg Focalin XR and it works pretty well, however my parents are thinking of upping the dosage a bit. The first medication I was put on for my ADHD is guanfacine (5 mg of it). Something to note is that I have naturally low blood pressure thanks to genetics. While the guanfacine did help me to sleep, I felt like I was a zombie when I was on it. It didn’t do anything at all for my ADHD aside from making me sleepy, which made me even less focused. The thing guanfacine does is it lowers your blood pressure. With mine already naturally being low, I fainted numerous times after getting up. I do not recommend this medication. It may work for you, but both me and my friend who were put on it got similar results - bad side effects, barely any good outcome.",ANG3L1Cs

It sedates you and turns off your inhibitions which makes you less impulsive. But that’s not helping ADHD at all. Same goes for autism and anxiety. You can argue that it helps certain things but for a drug to work you need to stay functional and not completely shut off and brain dead. I could not function normally while on this.

I have also had severe anxiety, depression, suicidality and other fun stuff when I hit puberty. It got worse and worse and worse. I was never happy. I was always scared. Nothing I did, no drug I was put on ever made a single difference at all and I thought I was irrevocably unable to get better. I never thought it was the guanfacine until I couldn't afford all my meds so I couldn't fill it that month. And then I got better. Significantly better.  I was genuinely happy. My anxiety decreased dramatically. I actually felt like I was living life. Eventually I figured it out. It was the guanfacine. That was the only change in my life that could account for that  I looked closely at the website for it and I found out that it was a depressant. They try to avoid outright saying it but if you research it enough, and know what to look for you find out it is. It literally gave me depression I didn't have.

Week two, we were to increase the dosage to 1 tab in the morning and 1 tab in the evening. I usually give it around 8 am/8 pm.

31,Guanfacine,ADHD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 3, 2020",25,"MY goodness this medication guanfacine was terrible for my daughte, It  gave her awful hallucinations and it broke my heart to see her that way. She would wake up out of her sleep screaming ""Spiders are on me "", then I thought she just had a bad dream, NOPE, while she was awake, she jumped up and started screaming, and jumping around and pointing at her arms saying 'spiders"", my baby was tore to pieces. Then another time, We are all watching a cartoon movie 'Trolls' and she did it again, jumped up crying so bad, saying ""Mommy please help me, they are going to get me, I'm scared"". She insisted they were really there and didn't understand why we couldn't see them. Knowing that really hurt her feelings and her self esteem. I wouldn't try this on younger kids like my daughter who is 7 yrs old, FOR ADHD. In sensitive kids. It is hard to restore that self esteem they once had.

The only issue is I will be falling asleep by 5pm now, and if I take the night before to try and curb this I'd be having the same side effect at around 12pm. It really did help me feel not so frayed in my thoughts, I didn't even realize I'd be thinking about multiple things at once in my head and not really focused on anything before taking this medication, and I felt this help in that regard, not entirely but it took the edge off it felt.

Her Neurologist prescribed this and the twitching went away immediately.  She has ADHD and I feel like her twitching was just a problem with impulse control because it didn't look like normal tics or Tourette syndrome that I've seen in others.

Lots of issues at first - very tired, upset stomach. But the change at school was near immediate. That was good for 2-3 weeks & seemed to fade. So we upped to 2 mg & had the same thing happen. Upped to 3 mg & was still having tiredness around 3-4pm, so Dr. advised to switch to dosing at night. Now everything is normal & we've been on the 3 mg for a few months now & the change in his behaviors has been life altering.

Essentially, it lowers NE. So, lower motivation, which nearly completely negates the easier task performance. THIS IS A COMMON THREAD. Therefore, works better in conjunction w/ stims.It also created depersonalization.

This summer we started him on Intuniv and completely dropped Focalin. The behavior and personality are great now. He is the sweetest boy when on Intuniv. He grew 3 inches in 3 months and gained weight (which is great for him!) However, huge side effects are sleepiness, tiredness and headaches (which he never had before). School work or homework remains undone. We have issues at school where teachers%u2019 complaining that he just does not care about anything and not participate in class. We have huge issue with completing home work. I am very frustrated.",Lora123

First day on 1 mg he was super hyper, then seemed unchanged.  A week later we went to 2 mg.  It's great.  He is more focused, less wiggly, finishes task in a more timely manner.  He still squirms but not as much.  His teacher is happy with the improvement.  Side effects-sleepy, dry mouth, emotional.  We have been giving him the pill in the morning.  Around 5pm he gets super sleepy.  The doc told me there is no peak in when the drug works but there is a peak in when the side effects occur.  They tend to be 8-10 hours after taking the drug.  We are going to try giving him the pill at night and see if it helps him with drowsiness.",mom2boys

He is much more focused and less irritable. Although in the end of week one and beginning of week two of this medicine, he was very cranky and irritable. He is sleepy in the afternoons, but he also takes Clonidine along with this medicine, which also makes him sleepy. So I hope the sleepiness improves. He has started the last week having severe stomach pain. He gets up many times in the night saying his tummy feels funny and he gets some diarrhea in the night. He also has a harder time staying asleep at night, which is new. Hoping the stomach pain stops so we can continue the medicines, as I feel they are helping him.",Anonymous

For two days, he could hardly get out of bed, was very cranky, and slept for nearly 8 hours on a drive home from school vacation (very unusual for him.) I called his doctor on Monday morning and she said to stick it out a few days. See how he did at school, and with getting up in the morning. The last two days have been problem free. He is MUCH more agreeable than ever. He is less emotional (a good thing), less cranky. He is remembering all the things he should. Overall his behavior is better.

His Doctor added his Risperdal back to try to cut down on the yelling out, singing at school, but so far I am not convinced that this is going to work.

Sleepiness has NOT been an issue, even though I had read many reviews and the label that said it might be.
