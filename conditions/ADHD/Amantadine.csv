0,Amantadine,ADHD,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 23, 2022",1,"In my experience, Amantadine helps a lot with motivation, mood, very little concentration on attention, although in my case I felt many side effects, my face swelled a lot, low-quality blood circulation gave me panic attacks. In my opinion, every body is different and it can be a good treatment for people who tolerate it well",alvaro

4,Amantadine,ADHD,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 19, 2018",43,"My sons neurologist put him on this because of behavioral problems, memory issues and lack of self control and not focusing.  After 2 weeks on it we saw positive changes in his mood and 3 months dramatic changes that even the teacher commented what an amazing positive change.  After a yr on this medication, he went from an C average student to an A avg.  and no side effects.",Gotchugirl
5,Amantadine,ADHD,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 28, 2018",29,"This has helped my son tremendously with ADHD and Hyperactivity. He couldn’t tolerate stimulants and was not able to absorb/focus on schoolwork. He started this and within weeks was doing much better. He had to stop this medicine for a surgery for 2 months and he was right back to not being able to concentrate/learn. Started back and 6 months later is doing REMARKABLY well, I can’t tell you how much of a positive difference this has made.",Whit
6,Amantadine,ADHD,8,,"January 13, 2016",45,"Primary related symptom was mild cognitive impairment: memory in particular, almost entirely episodic memory (autobiographical memory: stuff that's happened to you, including events, names, etc.) & short-term memory. Thought I was developing Alzheimers. Severe enough to derail career, finally lost ability to work. Amantadine effects: built slowly, subtle but noticeable improvement in memory over 6 month period. Huge improvement after 2 yrs. Problems remain in calibrating decline & improvement; I've certainly improved some functionality enormously: can remember day-to-day events, plans, commitments; can remain aware of what I'm doing, keep up focus; can multi-talsk (limited but definite) so I can interrupt & resume interrupted activities...",James in Canada

8,Amantadine,ADHD,10,,"December 14, 2011",59,"I saw amazing results! Happy to report that the phone calls from school stopped! His overall behavior improved in so many ways! Saw positive results with concentration and mood.  He was pleasant and easy going.  He was on 100 mg per day for the past 8 months, teachers, grandparents and friends saw the positive behavior as well.  3 weeks ago, he decided he does not want to take any medication, needless to say I am sad, for I feel that he will go back to struggling with school work and following rules and back to his oppositional attitude. So far in school things are just okay. His attitude at home is not good.  Hope he goes back on Amantadine!",lucky sunday
