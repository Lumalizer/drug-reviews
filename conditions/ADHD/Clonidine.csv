2,Clonidine,ADHD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 4, 2021",0,"I had been on vyvanse and dexedrine for about 5 years. However, I developed an alcohol problem, and ended up in long term treatment because of it. The treatment center took me off of my stimulants to pursue non-stimulant medications, one of which was clonidine.Even on the starting dose I noticed extreme fatigue, though when the dosage was upped after a week I became full on narcoleptic. Falling asleep randomly throughout the day, fatigue so extreme all you can do is sleep, and think about sleep, every waking moment.YMMV but everyone else at the treatment center I was at had the same issue as me.Back on vyvanse now, will never consider non-stimulants again.",AndrewB
3,Clonidine,ADHD,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 15, 2021",5,"Just started clonidine today, testing out the idea with my psychiatrist that as a 31 yo F, I’ve had undiagnosed ADHD since childhood. It is far too early to make lasting claims, but for me the effect was shocking within a short time of taking it. I would describe it as, literally the volume on my thoughts has been turned down. My thoughts would often be so rapid, and escalate to catastrophizing before I could even catch them. I can think clearly and even sit through a movie, which is something I struggled with significantly, since a very young age. I started with .05 and found that while it helped me quiet my mind, it didn’t seem to be quite enough for sleep. Will try the prescribed .1 dose tomorrow!",Quiet
4,Clonidine,ADHD,3.0,,"May 28, 2021",4,"At first, it was fantastic. I actually was able to sleep well and nothing could wake me up. About a year ago, though, I began having one notable side effect that was so hard to shake and it occurred daily: Morning sickness but I am not pregnant. Every morning when I wake up, I am greeted back to reality by bouts of nausea, dizziness, vomiting and exhaustion. It goes away in the afternoon and then I’m fine at night, but it can get bad. I want to try to get off of clonodine as well, but I'm still in the final stages of discontinuing seroquel so it would be too hard on me. The withdrawals aren’t that bad if you miss a dose, until you realize your blood pressure has spiked through the roof. My blood pressure on both seroquel and clonodine was so low, and I have a feeling it’s not a great idea to prescribe neurodivergent and mentally ill patients with a medication. It’s not the worst med I’ve ever been on, but there are some side effects that have never gotten easier to shake.",Cloveerika
5,Clonidine,ADHD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 23, 2021",6,"I was prescribed this for sleep, since I take Adderall in the morning and my job had gotten so crazy lately. I would come home and didn’t feel like I could actually relax. So I was prescribed a dose of 0.1mg ER at bedtime. By the second time my anxiety had gone through the roof and I felt like If I fell asleep I wouldn’t wake up! Some people tried to tell me that it was just in my head and that I should give it a chance, but I honestly think I’m too young to be taking a blood pressure medication, and I never want to feel that way again. Xanax felt safer than that medication...",Jacobtree
6,Clonidine,ADHD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 17, 2021",4,"My son's biphentin (Methylphenidate) slow release wears out by midday sometimes.Son has 0.2mg clonidine twice daily as needed as I can't get him out the door to go outside etc without it.  So he has one before we can go anywhere to avoid a problem.  One at bedtime if that's needed mostly it isn't but sometimes but it is to help him sleep through the night.The clonidine is amazing.  Without it phobias to guess etc, his emotions all get the better of him and affect the day for hours.  After this medication he can focus, stay calm and function so well.It's a fantastic medication, we used to have huge problems at home and out and about, but not when he's on this one.

So far I’ve had no side effects that I know of. I’m excited to see further down the road how it works.  It’s a tad pricey but I use good rx so much cheaper.

I also wanted to stop my stimulants because they didn't improve my quality of life like my neurologist kept telling me they would. My PCP recommended Clonidine. It really helps me relax and focus within about 30-40 minutes. I take 1 or 1.5 pills during the day when feeling anxious or overwhelmed and it really helps me relax, focus, and better control my thoughts. If I take 2 during the day, I get too sleepy. I do take 2 before bed and it helps me sleep really well. I really enjoy this medication, especially because it doesn't have addictive qualities. I'd definitely recommend this to others. Worst side effect was dry mouth that went away after the first few months. This med changed my life and is so simple.",Chris

20,Clonidine,ADHD,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 25, 2017",28,"This review is more frustration with my doctors than this drug. I was diagnosed with inattentive type ADHD over a year ago, although I've had it for my entire life. Because my heart rate was high, I was initially put on Strattera. Didn't work, massive headaches, gross night sweats. Gave up for a while. Finally got a new doctor and she puts me on Catapres because it helps with anxiety (which I have bundles of) and prescribing a stimulant would lead to ""questions about her qualifications"" (seriously tho). Taking it at night with my Trazodone does help put me to sleep, but has long-lasting lethargic effects during the day that end up causing ironic panic attacks at work because I hate feeling sedated when I need to be alert.

He takes Clonidne as needed for anxiety as the Zithromax (antibiotics) got rid of his tics so he doesn't need the Clonidine anymore for that. But sometimes his anxiety acts up at night and Clonidine relaxes him so he can sleep. He also has 1/2 a 3mg of melatonin but he can only take melatonin now that his tics are gone because before it made him tired while he was wired and that was uncomfortable.

We were worried because he talked SO much like he was on speed, and ran around the house looking for paper, books, pens to write with and never sat still but he was very pleasant when we started the Vyvanse. However, he was Always saying I'm sorry for blurting, please, and thank you which was unheard of before starting the Vyvanse.  We were noticing around 4:00 the Vyvanse wearing off and the aggression and whining came back with a vengeance! We added another .1 mg Kapvay after school with his Depakote and the result was AMAZING. He is pleasant ALL day long.",hmurphy
48,Clonidine,ADHD,7.0,,"April 4, 2011",66,"Kapvay (clonidine):My 8-year old son has been on various stimulants, in addition to regular clonidine, Intuniv, Risperdal, Seroquel, Strattera and Abilify.My son is extremely impulsive and aggressive to our family on a daily basis, and I had been thinking that nothing would help our son. Our new psychiatrist recommended Kapvay and we were very skeptical, as our son was irritable and even more aggressive regular clonidine with Kapvay, there has been a SIGNIFICANT decrease in our son's aggressiveness.  He is still very obsessive, rude and defiant verbally.  So physically, we rate Kapvay a TEN in decreasing aggression.  But only rated it a seven due to other factors.  It is the ONLY medicine that has helped physical aggression for our son.",Rampage

The only issue I am having is he is falling asleep around noon every day.  He hasn't had a nap since he was 16 months old.  He is 7, going on 8. I can't imagine his teacher will be all that amused when he goes to sleep during class tomorrow.",BeckyBeird

This has been a trying year as we started him on Concerta, Focalin 2.5, & Focalin ER, Intuniv:(Although the stimulants were great and we saw the benefits, it was difficult for me to see the negative side effects (tics and meltdown).  I had mentioned to my doctor a month ago about Clonidine to reduce side of effects of stimulants. She declined as she was uncomfortable with providing adult medication to children. However, she contacted me about Kapvay which has been wonderful. Day 6 and a bit sleepy unlike Intuniv (sedated). I will keep you up to date.",phenomenalmom

We see a wonderful and highly respected psychiatrist. He is very knowledgeable on ADHD medicines. I was told when their is an emotional factor to the ADHD, Clonidine is the best medication for this. We tried Clonidine after MANY stimulants and non-stimulants also anti-psychotics. Clonidine 1.0 mg 2x a day this was the only medicine that we saw immediate results with. The only side effect was the tiredness, which did go away. I started him on the Kapavy 2 weeks ago. This medicine is a true GOD send. He is calm, focused, and far less emotional. We can't say enough great things. Please give this medicine a try.",Aliathome4
