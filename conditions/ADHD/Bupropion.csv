1,Bupropion,ADHD,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 17, 2022",0,"So, I was put on Wellbutrin  150mg off label for ADHD and the possibility to lose some weight. I am roughly about 2-3 weeks in on taking this alongside 75mg Effexor and I am not having a good time. I am SO SLEEPY ALL THE TIME, not just slightly sleepy like full force falling asleep at my desk sleepy. Secondly, I am SO dissociated ALL THE TIME, and it's really preventing me from being my authentic self. I wanted to try and take this med at night but that is when I take my effexor and my fear of having a seizure prevented me from doing it. I most likely will just stop taking this med as the cons are too significant. I can't honestly think of any pros besides MAYBE helping my sex drive.",jaywal
2,Bupropion,ADHD,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 28, 2022",1,"Doesn't completely knock it out, but makes it POSSIBLE to concentrate, as opposed to Ritalin which FORCED me to concentrate.I still jump from thought to thought, and task to task, but far less so, and am able to do a single task for longer periods of time.  I'm also much better able to manage my daily activities, and things that need to be done (basic chores around the house, etc).  The executive dysfunction is pretty much gone (or at least greatly reduced).Had some stomach pains and nausea during the first week or two, but those seem to have pretty much subsided.  I AM eating substantially less, but I needed to lose weight anyway.",Jenn77
3,Bupropion,ADHD,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 24, 2022",0,"Used to take Adderall as a kid for ADHD and always worked. Needed to improve production at work, control hyperactivity and impulsive behavior. I'm disorganized and forgetful and it hadn't improved at all in adulthood. Doctor prescribed Bupropion in attempt to help with what he thought was Mood Disorder and not ADHD, incase he was wrong about diagnosis he has seen bupropion work for some people with ADHD. Prescribed as follows, 75mg 3 days, 75 mg twice a day after that for about a month. It wasn't doing anything for me other than helping me sleep within 5 minutes of trying to fall asleep, normally it takes me longer. Went back, was prescribed 300 mg daily for one more month. Started with first 3 days not feeling anything, sleep was heavily disturbed and couldn't fall asleep and if I did I'd wake up at 2,3,4 AM couldn't fall back asleep. Felt a little calm day 4 and 5. After that it was just complete stress. high blood pressure. My hair fell out. Sleep never improved. Tapering off now.",Henry Plowlane

I was really upset today quitting but I’m sleepy and can’t function and I’ve got worse every day there’s no way it’s normal to be unable to get out of bed this is the worst drug I’ve tried and I’ve tried almost everything I think this drug is energetic if you have only depression or sad but for adhd it has paradoxical effect and slows the brain down so much you can’t move and that’s on lowest available dose in uk,Zyban xl

The current doctor thought bupropion was a better choice and would help with weight loss.  I am an adult female 53.  Initially I experienced headaches, which I never did before.  I did not lose any weight on this medication.  I took it for about 4-5 months over the summer months.  It did not seem to help with ADD symptoms, but caused me to lose interest in everything.

6,Bupropion,ADHD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2022",0,"I was diagnosed with ADD and Bipolar II.  I was doing really well on Topamax as a mood stabilizer, Adderall 20mg twice per day, and Seroquel 200 mg at night to sleep.  However, every time I see a new doctor, they think if I keep taking Adderall it might throw me into hypomania.  This is not a proven fact, especially if you are on a mood stabilizer, and it's never, ever happened to me.  As a matter of fact, when I am taken off of Adderall, I get severely depressed.  One doctor put me on Wellbutrin instead of Adderall and I couldn't sleep for a week!  And, this was on Seroquel, which would completely knock anyone out otherwise.  I believe it threw me into a hypomania condition.  Every time I see a new doctor, I am afraid they will try and change the medicines that have worked for me for a long time.

I thought it might be temporary adjustment to the med. I took my dose on the 3rd day and the ringing intensified. I discontinued use at that point. It's been a week and my ears are still ringing. I had no idea this was a potential side effect. If you get any ringing in your ears, I would get off this med.

8,Bupropion,ADHD,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 21, 2022",0,"I started taking it last August for ADHD + depression + anxiety + mild OCD. At first my blood pressure would spike giving me bad headaches. That threw me off a bit, but I decided to stick with it and sure enough it improved in 1-2 weeks. It has definitely helped me with: - mood: I still have bouts of depression and anxiety but they are MUCH shorter, and with some support I'm back on my feet quickly (hours/days versus weeks previously)- energy: less hyperactive bouts, higher energy level overall (more stable)- binge-eating: so much easier to resist! Often don't feel the need at all. I've lost 5kg because of this.I don't feel like it helped at all with the OCD and it actually made my tics a bit worse, but the mood and energy effects are great and I'll definitely keep taking it.Now I would say I have fewer headaches than before because of being able to organize myself better, keep somewhat regular routines and get out of bed in",sara

I am 67 years old and never had treatment for my AD/HD  until now. I am able to complete tasks, my self-care regimen has become more solid and my thoughts are clear, not scrambled and overwhelmed. I have three healthy meals a day instead of crazily bingeing. I was a  little afraid to take it because anything that has been prescribed in the past that is an antidepressant has made me feel suicidal and that is not a challenge I ever normally have. I was only prescribed those off-label for migraines. I had a little nausea the first two days. Now life is different and I look forward to the rest of it.",Pix
13,Bupropion,ADHD,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 8, 2021",1,"I was prescribed Bupropion to help with my recently-diagnosed adult ADHD. I really wanted this to work for me, was very optimistic about trying this medication. I am now about two weeks in, taking 150mg extended-release once daily. The first two days, I felt fantastic, very good mood. The effect started to wane the 3rd day on, but I stuck with it because I had read it can take several weeks to become fully effective. Well, today is day 10 for me and I feel awful - not in terms of mood, but I was hit with sudden and intense nausea, as well as waves of feeling faint. Not subtle, but very intense.

I was already on escitalopram (10mg). Honestly I don’t really feel that it helped with anything. Not on focusing, or making my anxiety go away. Anyway, I gained 30 pounds between the time I began taking it up until today. I never suspected this medication to be the culprit of why I gained so much weight so fast. I thought it was because I started an office job and wasn’t moving around as much. I tried to eat lighter and got up as often as I could at work, but I continued to gain weight. So I started working out and STILL no change. I couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me until I looked back at when the changes began and I didn’t start gaining much until I started taking this medicine.",ACF

So I went to see my doctor, and she recommended this drug. Literally about 45 minutes after taking it I was in Costco shopping with my fiancé. She left me with the cart to go grab an item, and it took her a while to come back. I am usually very patient, but for some reason it infuriated me. It infuriated me to the point that I wanted to punch a hole in the wall. When she got back I bit my tongue, but wanted to scream. Then, as we were leaving I literally had a full-blown panic attack. I never have anxiety, but today I really felt like I was going to die. I was overwhelmed, angry, felt like I couldn’t breathe or swallow, and quickly left the store.

I wanted to try to fight the symptoms with a non-stimulant rather than just jumping straight into stimulants and this was the med my Dr decided on. I was on this for about a month and noticed some change with my attentiveness but not much. The negative side effects I had were the reason why I had to stop taking this drug. I had some irritability problems beforehand but this amplified them and made the spouts unpredictable, anything could set me off in any moment in any mood and I mean pretty intense bouts of irritation. It also brought along suicidal ideation which I had never experienced before using this med. Overall it changed my mental health and in a very negative manner so I had to stop taking it.",ricked

All these years (I am 60), I had undiagnosed ADD, fighting against which caused depression.  Transient side effects: mild headache, change in detecting odours (not in a bad way...noticed some perfumes that appealed before no longer do so, and visa versa with others.)  But overall, this has been a godsend.  I've done more ADD research (really, had no idea I had it as I was never hyperactive and am fairly high functioning) and am having both my son and mum tested.

Dr then started me on 200 mg SR.  2 weeks into it I started crying hysterically randomly and my depression got to the point where I didn't want to exist anymore. I pushed everyone away, I wanted to be alone.. I quit my job. I stopped being able to function and then the ideations got a lot worse. It may work for you, but if you feel worse just get off of it.

25,Bupropion,ADHD,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 7, 2021",8,"My medical insurance is very limiting, therefore I see a ‘doctor’ (nurse prac.) that believes his way or nothing.  Bupropion was all that I was offered. Being quite miserable I had to accept.  Upon first week, I felt no change in me; then began to feel a bit ‘different’ in regard to my depression and anxiety, a bit calmer, more pleasant perhaps.  This was supposed to be for my ADHD and help with the challenges of university.  For that, there has been no change.  Task wise:  I’m still in a dozen places at once.  With no choice in providers, I’ve reluctantly taken this for a year now.  Only recently an onset of bad memories, dark thoughts, agitation, frustration.  Nothing new or different in my life to bring this on, I can only blame this medicine.  I’m going to wean myself off, as I’ve been warned of harsh withdrawal symptoms.

I was hoping it would be a holy grail medication.The first day I took it I felt like I was on a strong stimulant. I was speed talking, getting lots done and the world was moving very quickly around me. Not necessarily unpleasant, but odd.During the first week, I started to feel very irritable. Every email I received at work would make me want to toss my laptop at the wall. Very extreme emotional reactions to minor upsets. I waited for this one out and for a few weeks and saw no improvement. It stopped my appetite, I would forget to eat for 8+hours and it was refreshing to not be a slave to my appetite and make choices about my food intake instead. If I didn't have a history of suicidal ideation and anger trouble, I would have stayed on this medication.

Tried the other non stimulants (clonidine made me sleep, guanfacine made me sleep, and strattera actually resulted in me throwing up about 30mins-1hour each day after taking the dose).

Maybe a little bit of a fuzzy feeling and pressure in my head.  I attribute all of those symptoms to the fact that this drug can raise your blood pressure.  Only slight dry mouth/lips.  No constipation, ringing in ears, no nervousness.  I could tell it was doing something within 2 hours of taking it.  I was alert in a way that I haven't experienced since childhood.  Getting things done was much much simpler.  My appetite wasn't really affected.

Luckily I'm being referred for a formal ADHD assessment so hopefully I will be put on an actual FDA approved ADHD medication, but until then I've been put on the sustained release version with another upped dosage. I've read a bunch of reviews on bupropion for treatment of ADHD and I've concluded that it is really hit or miss, and for me it's a major miss.

Even in the first few weeks I noticed how it helps with my ADHD, but recently I have also noticed that it takes about 4 hours until the effect ""peaks"" and it really starts becoming effective. So with my schedule it's around 11 when I feel like it's easier to get stuff done. I've also lost weight, but I'm not quite sure why, since I still get hungry and I still eat regularly.",Hello_friend
