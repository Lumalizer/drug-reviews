0,Hydroxychloroquine,Lyme Disease Arthritis,1.0,,"March 3, 2022",0,I've been suffering for 5 years with Lyme arthritis and have been taking hydroxychloroquine for a little over 2 months with no effect. How long does it take to see results? 400 units daily.,Janjones
1,Hydroxychloroquine,Lyme Disease Arthritis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 26, 2020",48,Unbelievable!  I’ve suffered with Lyme Disease for several years.  2 days ago I began taking Hydroxychloroquine for treatment of Covid-19 exposure. The first morning after I had taken 400 mg I felt fantastic!  Even my neck pain was completely gone and I felt awake and alive!  How can I get HCQ to treat Lyme?  What’s the proper dose and length of treatment?  Feels so good!  Glad I got exposed to  Covid19 (sniffles)  and decided to do the HCQ treatment!  Now I know it’s treating Lyme!  Wow!,Mickey
2,Hydroxychloroquine,Lyme Disease Arthritis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 13, 2020",24,"I started on Plaquenil 400 a day, about 10 days ago. Mild nausea after first dose but no side effects since. Slept good for first time in weeks yesterday and actually felt rested afterwards for first time in months with pain all but completely gone. I am weaning off steroids slowly while it gets in my system. Optimistic!",Juli

4,Hydroxychloroquine,Lyme Disease Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 21, 2020",54,"Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine):I took this drug Plaquenil  for a longer period and nearly lost an eye.  I had to have eye surgery the day it was discovered I had multiple retinal tears.  I had to be awake for 1+ hours and had a bubble in my eye for 8 weeks.  I have had continuing issues with my other eye, having laser surgery for tears (also awake) numerous times.  It will be a threat for the rest of my life.",yankeedoodle
5,Hydroxychloroquine,Lyme Disease Arthritis,6.0,,"October 6, 2017",53,"I have been taking Hydroxychloroquine, 100 mg for several years off and on for chronic lyme which cranked up arthritis soon after being bitten approximately 50 times on the first exposure. This seems to help once my body has adjusted. Often I can feel that it must be working because it will seem to bring on a Herxheimer reaction now and then but overall, this drug has worked well for me.",GoJ
6,Hydroxychloroquine,Lyme Disease Arthritis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 25, 2014",49,I have taken hydroxychloroquine  for less than a month  prescribed by my rheumatologist. As yet I see no improvement in arthritis symptoms but Dr. said it would take at least two months to see results. But  like some of the others on this website I am experiencing thigh pain that is unbearable by afternoon and evening. It is almost impossible to navigate stairs. I did not have this pain before taking this.,Snookey

8,Hydroxychloroquine,Lyme Disease Arthritis,10.0,,"January 26, 2012",127,"Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine):I felt better than I have in 20 years! After 20 years on NSAIDS needed for Lyme arthritis, my kidneys were affected, and when I stopped NSAIDS cold turkey, it was amazing how much pain my body was in.  Now a year into Plaquenil I feel like a new person. Get eyes checked every 6 months.  Had a little visual aura two days ago, don't know if from Plaquenil, but getting it checked next week.  Eye doctor said it wasn't serious.",jj120
