0,Plaquenil,Lyme Disease Arthritis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 21, 2020",54,"I took this drug Plaquenil  for a longer period and nearly lost an eye.  I had to have eye surgery the day it was discovered I had multiple retinal tears.  I had to be awake for 1+ hours and had a bubble in my eye for 8 weeks.  I have had continuing issues with my other eye, having laser surgery for tears (also awake) numerous times.  It will be a threat for the rest of my life.",yankeedoodle
1,Plaquenil,Lyme Disease Arthritis,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 17, 2014",106,"Plaquenil has been great for me.  It has reduced the stiffness & swelling in hands & feet to almost nothing.  Started at 200mg twice a day, and have since reduced to one time per day.  I have a complete eye exam once a year to watch for possible retina side effects.",Jason K
2,Plaquenil,Lyme Disease Arthritis,10,,"January 26, 2012",127,"I felt better than I have in 20 years! After 20 years on NSAIDS needed for Lyme arthritis, my kidneys were affected, and when I stopped NSAIDS cold turkey, it was amazing how much pain my body was in.  Now a year into Plaquenil I feel like a new person. Get eyes checked every 6 months.  Had a little visual aura two days ago, don't know if from Plaquenil, but getting it checked next week.  Eye doctor said it wasn't serious.",jj120
