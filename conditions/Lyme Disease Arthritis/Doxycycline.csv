0,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease Arthritis,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 10, 2019",4,"I've had chronic Lyme and now arthritis for several years now.  I've been on methotrexate, Enbrel, several others.  But nothing has helped my pain and to help with confusion as much as the Doxy has. It used to hurt me from the 'herxing' (releasing toxins faster than the body can eliminate them).  But not now.  I take twice a day 100 mg and it's helped with my arthritis tremendously. I have more energy as well. It could be where I'm feeling better but at least I AM feeling better being on Doxy. It's been a miracle drug for me for the Lyme and Arthritis both.",Possumlover
1,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease Arthritis,5,,"April 15, 2016",6,For  many years Amoxicillin was my drug of choice. Last year it stopped work on me.I had to use  Doxycycline which caused terrible burns all over my skin after 1  week of use. Even  the layer of sunscreen cream  did not prevent the burns. It did not matter - if I stayed in the shade of the tree or if it was not sunny days - I got those burns. Because I had to do multiple jobs outside the house and go to the stores - this side effect created terrible problems for me. For somebody who can stay inside for entire month - this side effect probably non existent. The drug effectively cured the condition.,Simon777
