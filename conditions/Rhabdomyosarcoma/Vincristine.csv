0,Vincristine,Rhabdomyosarcoma,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 8, 2022",0,"Prophylactic administration of VAC (Vincristine, actinomycin-D, cyclophosphamide) with 2mg of Vincristine every week for 10 weeks, 2 weeks break, then further course proposed of 10 doses. Doses ceased after 11 infusions of Vincristine due to severe peripheral neuropathy, in lower legs and lower arms, feet and toes being the worst. CIPN continues in my feet more than 5 months after my oncologist ceased the Vincristine doses. My cervical embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma had been almost certainly completely resected during pre-chemo surgery. The low grade and early stage of my tumour enabled a conservative chemotherapy approach to be taken once the side effects of Vincristine became unbearable. It is hard to say what role the Vincristine played in reducing or eliminating my tumour cells. As for side effects, not a good experience. But I’m cancer-free so it’s worth it.",Edith
