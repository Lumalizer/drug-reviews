0,Mesalamine,Lymphocytic Colitis,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 6, 2012",25,"Asacol (mesalamine):I have been on this medication for about 5 years now, 4 tablets a day, down from 6 a day.  Thank goodness it has worked, as when I had attacks, I lost 20lbs in 6 weeks.  Symptoms are pretty much gone, and life returned to normal about 2 months after beginning this medication. I was 55 when diagnosed, and just turned 60 and am doing fine.  I have no apparent side effects.",Anonymous
1,Mesalamine,Lymphocytic Colitis,8,,"February 4, 2011",27,"Asacol (mesalamine):I am newly diagnosed with LC, I am 38 years old and suffered with various GI issues for years.  Finally got a diagnosis and was started just last week on Asacol 800 mg tabs three times a day.  I have noticed that the diarrhea is slightly less frequent and less explosive after only one week.  I am hopeful, especially after reading the other user's comments, that this will help me.",Anonymous
2,Mesalamine,Lymphocytic Colitis,9,,"December 13, 2008",57,"Asacol (mesalamine):I have been on Asacol for about 5 years and it has changed my life. I had diarrhea for about 5 years previously and my doctor and 2 specialists couldn't found anything specific to help it.  We moved to another state where the gastric specialist did uncover the problem and I was started on 6 Asacol daily (2 tablets, 3 X a day). It took about 2 months, and one day my diarrhea completely vanished.  Gone. After about 8 months I began lowering the pills daily, kept on with 4 a day and am now taking 3 Asacol daily for maintenance. For the past 8 years have been swimming 4 X weekly at a wellness center.  Couldn't do that with bowel problems.  I had a colonscopy in December 2008, 5 days ago, and all is normal.  I'm 72 years.",cajunjoy
