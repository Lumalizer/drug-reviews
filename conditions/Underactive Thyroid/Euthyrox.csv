0,Euthyrox,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 1, 2022",0,"When my dr upped my dosage from 50mcg t0 75, Walmart gave me this box, instead of the bottle of 3 months supply at once. Euthyrox. I've never been completely happy with the hypothyroid meds, as I've never gotten rid of my symptoms of hypothyroidism. My dosage is too low and my dr won't listen to me. My last test showed my blood level at a 2.8. The 'normal' range being 2.4 - 4.2. Being that low is NOT ok for me as a woman still of childbearing age and my hair loss has not let up at all, like it should if I was on the right dosage for my body. But since June 24, 2021 when I was switched to this Euthyrox, I'm even more miserable. I didn't realize the side effects were so bad from what I'd been on previously. I started doing research in March and everything I've found has not been good for Euthyrox. My symptoms/side effects have been the shortness of breath, muscle spasm, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness associated with euthryox. No more of this rubbish.",Mountain Troll
1,Euthyrox,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,,"March 1, 2022",0,I was switched to Euthyrox by Walmart. I was on Levothyroid. I have had a major drop in my TSH. I am taking 100msg. I guess I will have to switch pharmacies.,FayeC
2,Euthyrox,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 25, 2022",3,"Euthyrox was given to me by my Walmart pharmacy instead of my regularly prescribed generic levothyroxine about 1.5 years ago. When I questioned the difference in the med, the pharmacy clerk said it was a new levothyroxine and that it was identical to my previous prescription (the pharmacist never explained anything to me). Since then my thyroid levels have been way off, my PCP kept changing the dosage thinking it would help level things off. After doing online research and discussing with my physician at length, we figured out that the changes to my levels was due to this medication. She immediately switched me back to levothyroxine, but I also had to switch pharmacies as Walmart Pharmacy only dispenses Euthyrox for levothyroxine. Seems like a deal was made with the Pharma company!!! This makes no sense and it’s very dangerous for Walmart to be making a decision for patients that could eventually be detrimental to their health. Bad business Walmart! I am no longer a customer.",img

4,Euthyrox,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2022",0,"Walmart changed my levothyroxine to euthyrox I questioned the pharmacist because I had never taken one in a blister pack she said it was the exact same thing that they had taken the dye out of the pills and repackaged. I started taking them I got severely ill, lightheaded, fatigue, headache, heart palpitations, cold sweats, chest pain and dizziness. I went to doctor he said tested positive for the flu still did not think about it being meds so I wound up at the ER with chest burning, dizzy, body shaking, uncontrollably they said all my test looked ok. Then he ask if I had started any new meds I told him I started Euthyrox about 16 days ago he told me to go back to my old pharmacy not Walmart and get them to fill a new prescription with the levothyroxine that I was suppose to be taking! I have been back on my regular meds for 2 days still have a ways to go to get back to normal.  People please do not take this drug I can’t believe Walmart is still dispensing this drug",Nina

7,Euthyrox,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 9, 2022",0,"I’m so thankful for this comment section. Walmart Pharmacy switched my Levothyroxine for  Euthyrox. After a month and a half of taking it, I noticed I was feeling very poorly. Severe headache, thirst, muscle aches, extreme feeling of being cold and generally achy and fatigued.

Third week most of my hair has fallen out and I experience tiredness and pain in my hips. After taking Euthyrox 27 days I had Wal-Mart to switch me back to my old medication.  Its been 6 weeks since I’ve switched. The tiredness and hip pain are gone. The rash on leg is mostly gone. The horrible hand and feet condition remain. Primary doctor gave me cream for eczema. Dermatologist has given me two different creams for eczema or psoriasis.  Hands were dry, scaly very red and flaky.  Hands itch and hurt at the same time.  Appear like burnt hands.  Feet are very hard and dry patches. I am praying for some answers. How long will this problem last before it clears up? Has anyone else had this rash?",Marie

Had headaches, terrible fatigue, muscle cramps, foggy brain. Probably more symptoms,  just didn't make the connection. After researching I read all the side affects. Went to Walmart and told them I did not want this Euthyrox anymore. It is confusing when I compared the generic of Synthroid and Euthyrox it both said Levythyroxine. I told Pharmacist I no longer wanted the Euthyrox, but if they label it all as Levythyroxine.....my rx history only shows Levythyroxine. So very leary. Will be asking for Synthroid generic to be more specific. See if that changes anything. Until then, I am miserable right now. I suggest DO NOT TAKE EUTHYROX.",Buttercup

Muscle aches, fatigue,brain fog, headaches, dizziness, dry mouth, weakness.  It was relatively easy to tell myself Iwas depressed, I was working too hard, it was age related (I am 74), and on and on.  FinallyI went back to when my symptoms began and knew the only change in that period of timewas my medication.  Then I checked out patient reviews of Euthyrox and knew I was not aloneso why is this medication still being prescribed?  I called my pharmacy to put me back onmy levothyroxin and never substitute that medication with any other drug again.  My following lab level also showed a decrease in my level.

I ended up a month later at the ER again for the same plus major digestive problems I eventually talked to pharmacy about switching me back, they did and I started to get better after a couple months. Then a week ago I got the Euthyrox again  and I thought it was probably just digestive problems and gave it another try well all my problems are back rapid heartbeat, head ache, bloating and nausea.

Started having strange symptoms - sensitive skin from scalp to foot, itching, insomnia, palpitations, and weird headaches that seemed to come from nowhere, and then the rash started.  Nothing put on topically helped.  Changed detergent, lotion, shower gel and it got worse.  Suspected the Euthyrox.  On Mar 30 found these reviews that explained it all.

I had headaches, low energy, dizziness, confusion and foggy brain. Didn't want to move as it hurt. I am retired nurse and knew the recent change was medication. I stopped taking it on 19th November. Went to Doctors office , was told to stop taking it. By Thanksgiving I was feeling better. Took a few weeks to feel normal again. Have been prescribed synthroid today. Going to try it. It is brand name of levothyroxine. Hopefully I can use it. They need to tell people how dangerous medicine is. I will stop using walmart. They told me I was sick with virus.

50,Euthyrox,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 10, 2021",11,I was switched to Euthyrox by Walmart four months ago.  My  TSH levels low so he dropped my meds down a small amount.  That's not unusual with my condition to have to change the meds a bit now and again.Within a few weeks I had constant muscle aches and pains.  I started feeling tired all the time.  My husband kept complaining because I was in his words unusually cranky.  My sleep habits changed. I did not associate this with my new medication until today.  Today I got my TSH levels back from the lab 10.59.  The only change in anything is this medication.  I'm seeing my doctor in two weeks and I will never again accept this medication.,MaryF

I feel like myself again after a year of anxiety, not being able to sleep, feeling uncomfortable in my skin, dizzy, tight chest, heart palpitations, and the list goes on and on. Not only was 2020 one of the worst years of my life because of the pandemic, but also because of this horrible medication.

I was on a different generic (I am not sure of manufacturer, but the usual color coded variety).  Same deal, Walmart just arbitrarily changed the script.  I DID protest when I received it but assured it was the ""same"". I was on this drug for approx. 2 weeks, and I started feeling horrible. Depression, anxiety, TREMORS and dangerous high blood pressure.  I ended up in the ER with sustained BP of 220/110.  This lasted for several hours. I went cold turkey (I am on 50mcg) and it took about 4 days to feel somewhat normal. I told ER docs to check my TSH, it was down to .2 from about 1.8. It should be pulled from the market.

He switched me back to the product I had been on for the last five years without any all these side effects. Euthyrox should be banned in this country as it was in France.

Since starting the new medicine I have had hives, angiodema, anxiety now going on a month. I called Walmart and they immediately filled my levothyroxine and they told me the two medicines had the same ingredients but different inactive ingredients and that was probably why I was breaking out with hives/angiodema.
