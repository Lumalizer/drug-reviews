0,Unithroid,Underactive Thyroid,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 1, 2020",10,Unithroid is first FDA approved thyroid meds.  I noticed when my mother took this over synthroid she was more alert. I have been on it 20 years. No problem.,Samantha
1,Unithroid,Underactive Thyroid,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 29, 2018",22,I was on generic Levothyroxine for just about under a year or so. At first it was ok. Then when I recently went to get my refill the pills had a very strong odor. It's hard to describe. Like a strange mix between a chemical smell and dirty feet. Makes you want to gag when taking them. I learned about Unithroid from a family member and asked my doctor to change me to Unithroid. It is really reasonable ($) like the generic but Unithroid has no nasty smell. I also just found out that it is made in the USA so that's cool. I am happy about switching over.,otaku-guy
