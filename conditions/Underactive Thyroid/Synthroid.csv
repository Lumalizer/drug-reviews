Never had any issues that I can relate back to synthroid.But I’m curious if my anxiety and panic disorder is related to this, because I have had it since around the same time I started this med and suffered my whole life. I also recently started having chronic dizziness that is pretty much 24/7 for the last 5 years. It’s probably not related but I’m curious if anyone else feels the same.",xdoll
1,Synthroid,Underactive Thyroid,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 9, 2021",3,"By far, the best T4 brand. I was first diagnosed with hypothyroidism whilst in Germany. There, I was given Euthyrox - which was absolutely terrible. So terrible, that I decided it was better to stop taking the drug and face all the symptoms of hypothyroidism. It's worth mentioning that a class action suit against Merck, the German laboratory responsible for Euthyrox, was successful in France. Now, back home, my endocrinologist changed my medication to Synthroid (same active substance, different brand) and she also told me that many patients had faced the same thing while on Euthyrox. It's been a bit more than 6 months and I'm feeling absolutely fantastic. Depression is gone, hair loss is gone, lost tons of weight. Recently, had my dosage reduced from 200mcg to 175mcg. I take it systematically every day right after waking up on an empty stomach. Really changed my life. + I'm also taking Wellbutrin XL 300mg (for 7 years now) and cholecalciferol. No interactions or heart palpitation.",M. L.

4,Synthroid,Underactive Thyroid,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 12, 2021",7,"I've been on levothyroxine for a year now and my life is so much better. When I graduated college at 21 and started working full-time, I was suddenly tired. All the time. Basic tasks made me exhausted. I always thought it was depression and tried counseling for years. I finally went to the doctor when I was 25 to get antidepressants and she made me get bloodwork done. I had an atrophied thyroid! After about six weeks on levo, I had so much energy and even lost 10 pounds! Then it stopped working, so we had to adjust the dosage. I haven't had any long-term weight loss unfortunately, but my energy is back up and I wake up refreshed, which is exactly what I needed.",NoSleepProbs
5,Synthroid,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 6, 2021",7,I have been taking random dosage of levothyroxine for 1 year now and my endocrinologist and I still haven’t found my perfect dose. I switched over to synthroid at 125 MCG and I’ve been on it for about 2 weeks now. I know it takes about 4-6 weeks to hit its peek. But I am just so impatient and tired of it not being my proper dose. I’m 27yrs and my left eyebrow hairs started to turn white and by bottom lashes are all white and now my top lashes are starting to turn white too. It’s very concerning I was told it’s from my autoimmune disorder. Is anyone else going through this?,Kimroid
6,Synthroid,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,,"June 17, 2021",19,"I have taken Synthroid (branded) since 2005 (dose .075) with no issues or side effects, have kept annual notes on TSH t3 t4 test results since that date.  Recently, my TSH dropped to .25 with t3 and t4 in normal range.  Doc switched me to .50  from .075 because my TSH was low.   The side effects were absolutely awful for 5 weeks with the worst being muscular pain throughout my whole body afraid my legs would give out.  I stopped taking after 5 weeks for 2 days while waiting to see Doc to see whats happening.  Within 1.5 days, the symptoms relieved without any pain medication.  I believe there is some change to the drug and have contacted Abbvie (waiting for an answer) to see if the fillers (which are numerous) have been changed from 1 dosage to another.   If you are having any side effects, you must call them and report it, especially if they are long term or severe as  mine were.   I am back on .075 with no issues...... something is wrong here.  Will keep posted.",Marbunk

It was and is the help I needed. After being on Synthroid for about a decade, my insurance requested I switch to a generic.   After a couple of months, my TSH levels were no longer balanced and my dose was increased.  After nearly a year of no control, no matter what dose I was on, my levels and symptoms wouldn't stabilize.  My doctor and I realized the change happened when I was switched to the generic.  It took several months back on the Synthroid before I was stable again.  No more generics for me, now it's my wallet getting lighter because of how expensive it is.  But at least my levels are stable.",CatB

Maybe it would be different had I been started on Synthroid from the get go but I've tried Synthroid two times, once at 75mcg and this week at 88mcg and the results were the same. Within three days I had muscle weakness, muscle spasms, more pain in neck and extreme fatigue. Regulation mandates 95-105 % of the active ingredient be present. I've taken Unithroid 88mcg and I never had the extreme symptoms like with Synthroid. I steer clear of this med because I can't afford to miss another week of pay fiddling around with it.

11,Synthroid,Underactive Thyroid,10.0,,"November 13, 2019",60,"Mine is a long story.   I began taking synthroid in 1993 after a required dr visit.  All I can say is WOW!  It was not a sudden boost but a lifetime of feeling listless and tired was gone.  I have been on the medication now for about 22 years.  If I miss a dose, generally doesn't feel bad.  Miss it for several days and I start getting tired etc.  Can't imagine being without it.  Certainly changed my life.  Didn't do it overnight but it sure did take away that sleepy feeling.  In 1997 the doctor told me it was known to be uncommon for men to have thyroid issues.  Well, I think thats because men aren't tested as much.  Now in 2019 I believe the treatment rate for men is probably just below that for women.  Good deal.  Never had a real bad experience.  Not sure though where the meds come from and the whole concept of changing brands.  I'm sloppy in taking it as I do it in the morning then drink coffee and often can eat breakfast right away as well.  Good Luck to all.",Spudth

So when my physician told me I had a under active thyroid I didn't really know what to think because I didn't feel as though I had any of the common symptoms. I just thought the symptoms the doctor mentioned were just normal ageing since I am 55 years old.     I have been taking this medication now for a little over 4 months and have started to see some noticeable changes. 1) my hair stopped falling out. 2) nails started growing faster and stronger. 3) All around much more energy. 4) Able to focus better.

I only have good things to say about this drug.  However, when you start blood tests are essential to determine the right dosage.  You must take on an empty stomach and no food for about an hour.  Also, you need to keep the Synthroid level constant in your blood system.  If you skip a day or two It is like you have to start over  to get back to the dosage you were prescribed.  This drug works.

29,Synthroid,Underactive Thyroid,6.0,,"May 24, 2017",143,"I have been on synthroid for approx 10 years.  Here are several points that I have learned:1.  You may initially start feeling better in a couple weeks but It takes MONTHS to see the full effects.2.  Depending on your TSH levels, your Dr should start you at a low dosage and gradually increase as needed.  Starting with too high of a dosage is shock to your body and will even make you feel more tired as your body is working overtime.3. See a Physician who is very familiar with thyroid issues.  If you are not seeing positive results with family Dr. see an Endocrinologist!  Many of the negative comments I have read may be a result of your Dr not understanding this disorder.  4. There are alternatives if this medicine is not working.",Jaybee63

Synthroid (T4 hormone), Cytomel (T3 hormone), and Armour Thyroid (T4 & T3 Hormones). Synthroid has gotten a bad rap because it's synthetic and it only covers the T4.

I refused to take this drug initially when I was first diagnosed in 2011 because of a bad scare taking the generic brand, so I let my new meds sit for six months before trying this brand. It works wonders for me and being a life-long gym and karate guy, I have more energy to do laps in the pool and do weights too. I have taken iodine and it works ok, but nothing like my Synthroid.
