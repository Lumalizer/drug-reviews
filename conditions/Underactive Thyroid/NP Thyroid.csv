1,NP Thyroid,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 22, 2022",3,"I have taken this for a month now 60mg- within the first 2/3 days I could tell it was working well. I felt drastically better, then a few more days my stomach started to bother me for a few hours after taking the meds. Then my stomach pain starting growing to hurting more painfully and longer, every couple of days it was intensifying. I'm in my 4th week taking it and I started to become bloated and gassy. Like I can feel and actually hear it moving through me and getting gas pains now too. Last nights pain topped it all- severe pain, nausea, running to the toilet because I really thought I was about to throw up. I was rolling over, curled in a ball in my bed for 12hrs in serious pain. Took mylanta, pepto, tums, tylenol and gas pills, even rubbed aspercream lidocaine on my stomach and back over the course of those 12 hours desperate for any relief and am just now starting to get some. Also I have had lower back pain that started maybe 2 weeks ago and was also very bad during this 12hr episode.",Ashleylauren

5,NP Thyroid,Underactive Thyroid,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 2, 2022",0,"I was originally prescribed 30mcg of NP and while it put me in normal range, it was on the very low end of normal. I told my doctor that I didn't feel a difference at all. So he upped my dose to 60mcg and wow! I feel myself again! So much more energized and motivated for the day. I wake up feeling more alert and ready for the day. The first couple of days I had some lingering headaches and some wild dreams at night but that was it. I will say, I read these reviews before taking it and was terrified but what you new takers need to account was most of these reviews were made when taking the NP during a recall of the med. Which obviously isn't their fault I'm not placing blame. But of course the side effects were awful and I sympathize with those that had to deal with that, but it is no longer recalled and works great! I felt like a whole new woman! Definitely recommend :)",EmSax
6,NP Thyroid,Underactive Thyroid,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 24, 2021",2,"I don't understand these poor reviews. Sounds to me that the prescribing physician is more likely the problem. In a lot of these reviews, sounds to me like over prescribing issues and I'm not even a doctor myself.  I've been on NP thyroid so several years after armour thyroid became ridiculously expensive and occasionally unavailable. My TSH levels have been right on target and I experience no side effects or symptoms described in many of these reviews.",Danielle

I have gotten married and all in this time being on the new med. I literally felt like I was dying with the amount of panic and anxiety attacks I was having, not feeling myself, brain fog, feeling doomed, exhausted, overwhelmed and overall just off. Instead of checking on the thyroid medication because I have taken a few different kinds since I was 11 years when I was originally diagnosed (I’m 35 now) and never having any side effects, I completely regret it. I literally thought I was losing my mind.. the waves of emotions along with the ups and downs, just brutal. I had complete loss of my sex drive along with any feelings at all. I thought that it was stress from work and my wedding, thought I had a mental breakdown, I went as far as therapist to a psychiatrist trying multiple medications trying to fix this.

8,NP Thyroid,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 2, 2021",6,"Was okay until the company making it stopped putting the correct amount of thyroxine in the pills. I was falling asleep all the time, everywhere! And had absolutely no energy for anything. The Company making the drug, finally talked & I had to go back to levothyroxine. Things have been a little better, but not great. Throw out this medication when you get a different one, but follow up on all the things that are contraindicated to taking synthetic thyroid for Low thyroid. Your doctor probably has NOT researched or even read the accompanying information concerning the drug he/she is prescribing.  DO YOUR OWN research, no one else bothers!!!",Palatine
9,NP Thyroid,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,,"October 25, 2021",10,"I was on Armour Thyroid for many years. Pharmacy recommended NP, because of price difference, so switched me to NP and I noticed extreme flu-like symptoms, head aches, hair loss, insomnia, swelling, (even facial swelling), all-over body pain and constant exhaustion. I asked to be switched back to Armour after a month of misery on NP, and to please make note on my account to NEVER give me NP again, because of the terrible reactions. After new bloodwork, I unknowingly was given NP again, and took it without realizing that it wasn’t Armour. My life became a living nightmare! The anxiety attacks have been awful. My nails break easily, hair falls out in alarming amounts, continuous dull headaches, accompanied by brain fog that has been very concerning. The feeling of exhaustion is unbelievable and I cannot sleep. Joint pain, miserable indigestion & reflux, profuse sweating, inflammation, and muscle aches.

I could actually be productive during the day. But then slowly all that energy turned into anxiety, I couldn't rest, I caught myself ready to argue with anyone at anytime, I felt such intensity ,the negative kind. So I asked the doc to switch brands bc what I was feeling didn't seem normal to me, also my blood test showed even lower thyroid (meaning the medicine wasn't working) & that I needed a testosterone booster. They switched me to Armour. The first week I was crying uncontrollably, I had a breakdown at work, it was ridiculous and then another breakdown for no reason!. My boss thought I was crazy. I've been on Armour for 2 weeks now, this 2nd week they gave me a higher dose (45mg) and I don't cry anymore but now I feel tired, like I'm on caffeine all the time.

A week into taking this I noticed my body aching and heart palpitations. Then my heart started pounding and I got all jittery. My hands and knees were shaking and I felt weak with a headache and brain fog. I called my pharmacist and after talking to them they exchanged that medication for my regular Armour.

Do a search for it. You’ve been warned! Acella can’t get it right & it’s just not a reliable choice. Go with brand-name Armour Thyroid instead (it’s literally the only one left that isn’t horrible) or get a script for 2 synthetics (Tirosint/Tirosint-SOL are the cleanest T4) along with T3 (Cytomel/liothyronine, or compounded synthetic) to balance the thyroid, OR if Naturethroid/WP ever come back on the market, try one of those",Aimee

It is now coming back, thankfully, and I also feel like my emotions are back in check. NP Thyroid, I believe is the cause for my hair loss. I just received a letter from Kroger(where I had my prescription filled) that there’s a recall for certain lot numbers of NP Thyroid because testing found these lots  are super potent and may have 115.0% of the labeled amount of Liothyronine(T3)! This is unbelievable and so wrong! Everyone who starts feeling worse on this med needs to stop immediately and get on something else.

Within a few hours I was fatigued, headaches, joint pain, incredible water retention, chest tightening... After doing this a second time, I knew for sure it was the medication. I then noticed that my med bottle said NP Thyroid. I called the pharmacy and they said they had replaced with Armour with NP 6 weeks before. They did not inform me! NP totally didn’t work at all for at least a month. And while I took this failure of a medication, my pregnancy failed because I had no functional thyroid hormone to sustain it.

I stopped taking the medication and a few days later the headaches went away and my knees felt better..,Anonymous

I’d snap at the drop of a hat and have fuzzy thinking. I stopped and switched back to Levothyroxine, still dealing with the initial hair loss of starting Levo but I’m so much happier, more energetic and not moody. Legs veins have disappeared. I’d never recommend T3 or NP thyroid to Anyone.",Anonymous
95,NP Thyroid,Underactive Thyroid,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 12, 2019",37,"I have used almost every desiccated thyroid med out there. Armour was great until forest labs ruined it, Nature throid was the best until RLC ruined that and now after 3 bad batches of NP Thyroid this refill is working great. Nice to finally get something that works without side effects. NP  is working as well for me as the old Naturethroid used to work. Started losing weight, improved energy and feeling a ton better. Hope the next batch is this good. Makes you wonder why the manufacture screws this stuff up all the time making those of us who need this to feel better.",Biggie B

There was even one occasion where I was hospitalized for heart palpitations and come to find out my thyroid was all messed up. I had been on 150 mcg for two years but started to notice my skin, hair, nails and of course weight was off (weird weight gain, no diet changes). I moved and started a new doctor who recommended NP Thyroid. She started me on 90mg. The first two weeks I noticed rapid heart beat but nothing scary. By week three I felt like a super woman and had my normal energy back! After four weeks I finally feel better!",Coley

I'm not sure what is causing out T3 to tank out, but so far this is the only Thyroid medicine that works and it's like night and day difference for us.  I have energy, I sleep, joint and chest pain have stopped, and depression symptoms have lifted.  I would recommend anyone searching for thyroid medicine to try one until their symptoms change.  My numbers became 'normal' with other thyroid medicines, but this is the only one that fixed my actual symptoms.",Kris

I couldn't get up to my  3rd floor  apartment it was awful was switched to NP Thyroid and I got my life back. I've found that if you take it before bed or if you get up in the night it  works better on a empty stomach then when you get up in the am you don't have to wait for your coffee. I  even called Acella Lab  and asked them if they had any intentions of reformulating NP Thyroid they said absolutely not!!  Keeping my fingers crossed!!!!  This is the first time in 5 yrs my  levels are right on track I Love this Medication. My Insurance doesn't pay for it but At this point I'll pay for it to  feel myself again.",Lylly

They claim this is the generic.  On NP Thyroid, I feel tired all the time, and have all the symptoms of hypothyroidism.  My hair is falling out again in clumps and my weight loss is stalled.  I used to be on WP Thyroid before they had manufacturing issues and loved it but I can't get on it anymore.

Normal :)I have not done well on NP ....I went back on NT for a few months and felt normal again. I returned to NP and felt sick yet again. I stuck it out for 6 weeks so I could do labs and raised my dose. I did not go hyper but the ill feeling got worse. I have no sensitivities, allergies etc. I did not think switching to NP would be difficult.  I've tested this 2x now and the same response. My symptoms each time on NP are; headaches eventually becoming migraines. Severe leg edema. Dry eye, rash on my face, stomach bloating, loss of appetite, tired, food tastes like cardboard, and general feeling of unwell. All of these symptoms are signs of hypo for me and I haven’t had them at all since I was treated with NT. I’m not against NP but wanted to share it isn’t working for me for unknown reason.",Kel

Fatigue ok BUT brain fog much worse, painful joints, stiffness in muscles and leg pain that feels similar to restless legs. The worst symptom though, is headaches. Constant. Am now experimenting with altering my dose (again!) but I’ll have to swap to Armour I think. I’m in the U.K. Getting hold of NDT is like finding a unicorn. I despair. I wish Naturethroid had never changed. I know they deny a reformulation but it worked like a dream for me before their manufacturing issues and I felt well. Now I’m back in the hypo pit and it’s dreadful.",Momof3

My bp has mysteriously gone up in the past year so decided to give NP thyroid a try to see if my blood pressure stabilizes and so far so good! It's been only a few weeks so in 8 weeks I shall see how it goes but I am pleased thus far. It seems nature throid has a huge amount of fillers my body just can't tolerate at least that is my conclusions. Everyone is different but I definitely don't want so many fillers in my meds all my life!,Crissy

Periods became irregular again, eyebrows thinning, hair falling out, insomnia, mood swings, weight gain...the last straw was a trip to the ER for heart attack symptoms last week. Thank goodness, NatureThyroid is available again...and now directly from my ND. Just got back on it yesterday. Looking forward to feeling great again.",acook

I looked for alternative and was on Nature-Thyroid and had no problems when suddenly it disappeared for the market.  I went back to Armour but was sick of the price gouging and found NP Thyroid.  I have been on it for a month now and have been an utter mess.  First week was fine, but then a sudden drop in general well being.  I cannot focus, constant fatigue, grogginess, barely able to function, balance is off... just generally horrible.  Thankfully I am able to get Nature-Thyroid again and am waiting for the new prescription to arrive.  Once it does NP is going in the trash. Avoid... avoid... avoid!!!",Dave

It took a month to realize that it was causing my eyebrows to thin, my skin to be bad again, and my moods to be all over the place. I’m very weepy. I don’t have a lot of energy. It is supposed to be the same formulation but if it is, why would I experience this? I have a lot of NP, and have been adding an extra pill each day. It helps a little, but I don’t even think that’s enough.  I’m unable to concentrate and I just want to sleep! I’m switching back as soon as I run out and my insurance provider will cover the next prescription. They won’t cover the switch right now, because I have a 3 month supply of NP.",GJG .......
