A non traditional Endo finally agreed with me after testing more than just my TSH and considering my symptoms. But finding something that worked has been hard. I felt almost worse on T4 alone. Armour thyroid helped for awhile but then I began crashing and found my reverse T3 numbers had skyrocketed. My doctor pulled the AT and started me on 25 mg of cytomel. Within a day, my constant headaches were gone and I felt lighter and more energetic. It’s only been a week but I’m optimistic",Hypofor5years

At first it helped my energy level but then I had rapidly changing moods, insomnia, sweating, anger/irritability feeling like I might go crazy/jump out of my skin, severe bloating all over, but the worst part was the feeling of depersonalization/derealization. Scary! Lowering the dose down from 10 to 5mcgs didn’t help. I’ll just stick with Armour without this added.

I started taking it a few years ago, due to inability to convert T4 into T3 - it seemed like a miracle worker, although, I was on a very strict diet. I did lose weight, but never could get my body back to what it was pre hashimotos Thyroiditis. I also noticed lots of sweating, water retention, mood swings (especially when the dose was incorrect, it changes often due to what You eat, etc.), hair loss; although, I noticed it growing back in after about  7 to 8 months, it was very thick. I also had an increase in appetite throughout the years, with less absorption capabilities when not eating very low carb.

Luckily, my current doctor let me try it (Nov. 2020). Two hours after taking one 5 mcg pill I felt better. My mood lifted and my mind was clearer. I had the energy to complete a work day. It has been a godsend. We have slowly increased my dose... two pills, three pills and four pills (20 mcg) a day. Any more is too high for me. While initially I had the occasional headache when I first woke up in the morning, that is gone now. No other side effects. No weight loss, but holding steady.

I then went on tirosint and begged my endo for t3 cause everyone said my numbers weren't optimal. She put me on 5mcg and I have taken that with 88mcg tirosint for over a year. I have had cycling depression the whole time and slowly put in weight no matter what I do. Recently had a bad flare and doc said maybe it's the t3. Stop taking it. I did and a lot of my pain and fatigue lifted. I tried re dosing several times and everyone in my support group is shunning me because I want to quit. I am withdrawing now and hope that is over soon.

You won't believe this:  25 mcg Synthroid and 5 mcg twice a day Lyothyroninr (Cytomel, or T-3) and the weight is practically falling off. I started on it May 13, 2016. That's 4 weeks. It started a few days ago and is I'm losing over a pound a day, sometimes 2. I wish I had known. See, my body makes antibodies to the desiccated porcine thyroid, as well as to my own. That's supposedly very rare. They were three times as high on Armour and Naturthroid as my own thyroid, and it's pretty high anyway.",Janine Maria

I had a huge reaction to the pill.  I felt like I wanted to get out of my skin,  Bad stuff.  So I started taking the dessicated thyroid, which was much better and I have been on it for many years. Recently, one doctor changed to liothyroine .  I got huge headaches that would not go away no matter what I took.  In two days of taking the pills, I stopped taking it on my own and switched back to the one that I had been on for so long.  The dosage now has to be increased, but at least I will not get the headaches.",Elaine33081

Large dosage of Synthroid ineffective, nurse practitioner certain nothing wrong, physician A dosage is ok but maybe a small bump, small effect for short period then return to prebump effect, concerned that observation due to psychological rather than physiological waited, physician B does further workup, physician B sees most of Syntroid dosage going to reverse T3 (physiologically ineffective) adds Cytomel, the improvement was immediate; not psych.",A Complicated Patient
