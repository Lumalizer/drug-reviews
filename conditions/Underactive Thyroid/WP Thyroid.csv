0,WP Thyroid,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 21, 2020",30,I was on the original WP thyroid in 2014 and loved it! It was a life changer for me with energy etc. I started on the new WP and it landed me in the hospital. I’m STILL dealing with the effects. I had edema from head to toe and put on 12 pounds in one week. My gut microbiome was totally wiped out and I literally stopped digesting food properly. That along with severe bloating/fluid retention made me look 9 months pregnant. I’m very healthy and normally thin. This drug has some really dangerous new components. Don’t use!!,JG
1,WP Thyroid,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 24, 2020",16,"I was on WP before RLC went through their new lab. Started back on WP since reopening lab and wow, this medication does not do a darn thing for me. Nada....all my symptoms have blown up. This is pathetic of this company. Why would they allow this to happen? What a disaster for sure. Going to try something, I'll be damned if RLC receives another dime from me.",DLF
2,WP Thyroid,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 25, 2020",38,"This worked absolutely AMAZING until the supposed shortage. I was losing weight, my mood was good, skin clearing up, great energy levels and then out of nowhere the drug is gone. I called RLC labs (when they were still responding to patients) and was assured they were on backorder and were working hard to fill the orders. When it started coming back on the market I was thrilled, but after the first dose I knew something was seriously wrong.This drug is a reformulation, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The best way to describe it is that I felt like I was being poisoned ( Not surprising given that the FDA took over RLC labs and the manufacturing is occurring in China). It’s a real shame when money and profits come before patient care and peoples lives, I will never use a product from  RLC labs again, and they should be absolutely ashamed of themselves (probably why you can’t speak with a representative when you try to call and question the company regarding the product.)",CalmClould123
3,WP Thyroid,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,,"February 8, 2020",25,"I've been hypothyroid for 20 yrs. I can't tell you this when the thyroid medicine is bad or not the same. I had horrible reactions to Synthroid, Armor NT and NOW WP. I choose WP 6 years ago, and man do I feel like a rockstar! Weight loss was easy, mood, fatigue, skin, hair loss all gone! Yes I'm agreement with everyone here, since recall not only WP-NT as well, weight gain thyroid numbers T3-4 FT3 LOW RT3 high, now my iron is off the charts and I don't use Iron, since the shortage and here and there getting some last year, I'm mess. WHEN I SPOKE TO MY pharmacist when it AKA ran out he said they are making the dugs in China, really? What pig glandular are they getting??? I swear my  iron is elevated from these meds. I never had this issue. I'll be back to report my experience with the GMO free-grass fed cows bovine from New Zealand. Well its my turn BYE BYE thyroid meds. And a HUGE thx u to you all and Thx you Drugs.com",Wellness Coach Marie
4,WP Thyroid,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 16, 2020",23,"WP thyroid last year. Did ok. Just refilled and what happened? I take it now and within an hour I crash! Like taking a sleeping pill instead of NDT.So unhappy. Stopped for several days. Started again today. Forgot about the symptoms then got slammed again, wondered, ""Why am I so tired!!??"" Looked at the clock and realized I had restarted WP an hour before. Shame on RLC! The ratio of T3 to T4 was changed!",Lucky1
5,WP Thyroid,Underactive Thyroid,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 29, 2019",40,I lost over 60 lbs when WP thyroid was working before the remanufactured product. My thyroid was like it used to be before my thyroid problems started. But then the labs lied. And changed the formula. And it is garbage. Don’t use WP thyroid. It’s like my thyroid is worse now. I had to triple the dose and it still isn’t enough. Throw away your new WP. I would like to take legal action against the manufacture.  We have been lied to and now we have physical harm on top of it. ,Eileen
6,WP Thyroid,Underactive Thyroid,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 14, 2019",52,"I was taking the old batch of WP Thyroid and it worked beautifully for years!Switched to the New Batch you know how they have since  started reproducing it. Now, I'm having severe side effects from the New WP Thyroid, severe joint pain stiffness, fogginess, dizziness, chest pain, rapid heartbeat,fatigue, and night sweating. I tried contacting RLC and no response. I think they are not responding because they know there is a problem.There is definitely a change in the new formulation... and terrible side effects. BEWARE!!",gwensha
7,WP Thyroid,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 3, 2019",33,"I WAS on WP thyroid last year (2018, from 2016-for about a year & 1/2) & had the best results EVER. Then WP thyroid  was gone, and I went onto NP...which was horrible. Weight gain, mood swings, brain fog, swelling. So MD put me on Armour. Not bad; things improved & I levelled out but the swelling remains (I've had it my entire life in my right lower leg, only & I mean ONLY the WP relieved me of it! It was literally a God send!). So, when I saw that WP was back in production I hounded my doc to order it. I've been on it 5 days & it STINKS. Foot swelling returned with a vengence, irritability, constipation, head aches!! I called the MD after reading reviews on here (which only confirmed what I knew) & said put me back on the Armour. It seems the formula MOST DEFINITELY has changed, for the WORSE!!  I was surprised my insurance covered it (it didn't last time!), now I'm imagining why...Don't waste your time with this garbage. It IS TERRIBLE, in my case!",GingerAmy
