0,Levothyroxine,Underactive Thyroid,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 1, 2022",0,"Euthyrox (levothyroxine):When my dr upped my dosage from 50mcg t0 75, Walmart gave me this box, instead of the bottle of 3 months supply at once. Euthyrox. I've never been completely happy with the hypothyroid meds, as I've never gotten rid of my symptoms of hypothyroidism. My dosage is too low and my dr won't listen to me. My last test showed my blood level at a 2.8. The 'normal' range being 2.4 - 4.2. Being that low is NOT ok for me as a woman still of childbearing age and my hair loss has not let up at all, like it should if I was on the right dosage for my body. But since June 24, 2021 when I was switched to this Euthyrox, I'm even more miserable. I didn't realize the side effects were so bad from what I'd been on previously. I started doing research in March and everything I've found has not been good for Euthyrox. My symptoms/side effects have been the shortness of breath, muscle spasm, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness associated with euthryox. No more of this rubbish.",Mountain Troll

When I questioned the difference in the med, the pharmacy clerk said it was a new levothyroxine and that it was identical to my previous prescription (the pharmacist never explained anything to me). Since then my thyroid levels have been way off, my PCP kept changing the dosage thinking it would help level things off. After doing online research and discussing with my physician at length, we figured out that the changes to my levels was due to this medication. She immediately switched me back to levothyroxine, but I also had to switch pharmacies as Walmart Pharmacy only dispenses Euthyrox for levothyroxine. Seems like a deal was made with the Pharma company!!! This makes no sense and it’s very dangerous for Walmart to be making a decision for patients that could eventually be detrimental to their health. Bad business Walmart!

After five days of taking this drug (yesterday was my final dose), I discontinued it and advised my PCP. I've read a few online articles written by MDs that say there's controversy within the medical field re: what's normal for a TSH level AND most labs use a normal reference range of 0.5-5.0, meaning that, at most labs, my TSH level would be normal. To boot, the article also says that older patients (like me) should have a TSH level greater than 4.0 or 5.0 because TSH levels increase with age.

I have heart failure. The Euthyrox made my life miserable. I had  HORRIBLE leg cramps during the night, I had no energy. I had gone from getting a lot done around the house into just sitting. The Walmart pharmacist told me that Alvogen's warehouses are in Miami and that the Haiti hurricane had flooded the warehouses and now there was a shortage of Alvogen Levothyroxine. Finally, yesterdqay, I called the Walmart pharmacist and insisted that this drug is a bad drug. He switched me back to the product I had been on for the last five years without any all these side effects. Euthyrox should be banned in this country as it was in France. I am wondering what it has done to other organs of my body and if it was sufficient to keep my thyroid at a working level. Without a blood test at this time, I don't know.",Jo
