0,Niacin,Niacin Deficiency,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 16, 2021",1,"Niacin supplements have been miraculous in eliminating my symptoms. I had both psychiatric symptoms like depression and anxiety, and also had skin issues. In the skin, I had a thick, scaly, darkly pigmented rash around my genitalia. Dark scaly pigmented skin is classic symptom of pellagra that often manifests around the neck or hands. For me it was around my genitalia. 2 weeks on niacin and the rash has completely cleared up. I also no longer suffer from depression or anxiety.",Fodzee
