0,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 16, 2022",0,"I also am an RN and had Versed today for cataract surgery (I do not know the dosage - I was dosed x 2, but asked post-op what I had been given) with absolutely no affect. Fortunately, the numbing eye drops that they used many times kept me from feeling any pain.",Deborah
1,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 23, 2022",0,Does not work on me at ALL! I've been given the most you can give a person and still had a panic attack during 4 different procedures. I think it shouldn't be used for patients like myself with anxiety and panic disorder. It's useless.,Dragon_Mom
2,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,,"December 28, 2021",3,I tell the nurses and dr each time I have a procedure that this medication does not work for me. They totally ignore me. I had a trial stimulator put in my back today after telling every nurse and dr they still used it. I was totally awake until they finished. Horrible experience. It was so painful. I am not happy!!!,Upset
3,Versed,Light Sedation,,,"October 2, 2021",0,"I just had an injection in my back and was given Versed. The anesthesiologist knew that the first experience I had with an injection in my back went very badly and was extremely painful. After this terrible terrible injection, the anesthesiologist told me he even gave me more Versed because of the previous experience. I’ve felt everything they did and it was excruciatingly painful. I don’t think I can blame the anesthesiologist though. It may just be my reaction to the drug but I’m totally traumatized now and I can’t imagine ever getting a third injection in my back after this experience. This better work is all I can say!",Jennifer Chapma
4,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 28, 2021",0,I had a vertebroplasty done on two back fractures.  Have had versed in past and worked fine.   Not this time. I felt every minute of dr working  on me.   Not sure it worked in past but not this time,Chris
5,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 19, 2021",0,I was given versed and fentanyl for wisdom tooth extraction. I specifically choose a doctor who would sedate my and clearly expressed I did not want to have to feel and remember what was happening. My doctor explained I’d be in a dream like state and not very aware. I remember everything. It didn’t really hurt and they also gave me a bunch of shots of local anesthetic (probably lidocaine but I didn’t ask). It was uncomfortable and I could hear the tooth crack and I still remember the sensation of them twisting my teeth out. I also remember the entire conversation they had while working on me which was very unprofessional ( they were talking about family issues and how they hate the other hospital nearby and stuff like that). I’m now scared to ever need another procedure and I can’t keep replaying the feeling of them twisting my tooth out in my head.,Wisdomtooth
6,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,,"August 17, 2021",0,So I went in to have my wisdom teeth taken out and they gave me Versed but I did not fall asleep why not?,Dentist
7,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 7, 2021",4,"Had what I swore was PTSD after horrific experience with IV versed for cardiac cath- could not move nor talk but knew it was taking way to long. Was uncomfortable from positioning and kept having waves of impending death. Now I need cataract surgery and allowed them to convince me that the cath experience was due to how gravely ill I was and the fact that it was a lengthy procedure. 1st eye went OK-partial amnesia, no pain but again feeling of impending blindness/death. Procedure only took 10 min which I could deal with. 2nd eye,  another horrific event. After procedure given tylenol and ushered out the door. Sorry state of American health care. I went home and took tramadol. PS-shame on me I am an RN and should have known better but in my area if you ask to many questions or complain they throw you out of practice and supply well exceeds demand so what can you do. No more invasive care for me EVER !!!!",horrified
8,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 8, 2021",8,"I was given Versed twice for cataract surgery.  First surgery went perfectly, and I had the sensation of being asleep and then awakened in recovery.  The second surgery a month later resulted in a situation where I remembered every aspect of the surgery, but had no pain, likely due to the anesthetic eye drops being used.  I will not choose this drug for anesthesia again.",Magoo
9,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 16, 2020",14,"Had paradoxical reaction before hernia repair - was supposed to be light sedation but instead had to be put under to finish the surgery. Had anxiety attacks for years after. Had numerous operations - before and since - with nothing but local, and they were fine. Two hand surgeries involved Fentanyl, which I have no issue with. For me, Versed is the PCP of Benzodiazepines.",Versed Busters
10,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2020",21,My dad was given versed during a colonoscopy at the VA and he never recovered his memory.  He was absolutely independent prior to the versed.  He was robbed of the rest of his life because of this drug.,MC
11,Versed,Light Sedation,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 12, 2019",30,"Although I have too enjoyed Versed, I'm writing this as a witness to what my friend went through. My buddy dislocated his arm for the second time. After learning about Versed and memory loss he asked to be knocked out. The Doctor refused and rather insisted on Versed with plenty of Demerol. The drugs were given and my friend laid comfortably until it was time. The Doc and helper started trying to put his arm in. That's when the screaming began! While under the drugs my friend was communicating (yelling/crying) with the doctor, begging him to put him out. He even told the doctor, ""I'll remember this"". It was a lengthy painful struggle but the arm finally popped in. My friend then quickly fell asleep. Once he came to, he didn't remember a thing! Witnessing that, I've have disturbed feelings about the drug.",Friend
12,Versed,Light Sedation,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 20, 2019",4,"I had Versed for 2 steroid epidural injections today and the Versed maybe lasted 2 minutes, if at all.  I remember the nurse saying my lower back will be very cold and I remember the 2 injections because they felt like big bee stings.  I questioned not receiving the Versed and was assured I did.  My hands were over my head on the table and the IV was in my hand, so I didn’t actually see anyone putting anything in it.Next time I’ll skip the Versed and then I won’t need someone to drive me home.",Jjones
13,Versed,Light Sedation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 26, 2019",4,"I'm extremely claustrophobic and needed to have an MRI done on my neck. Could not do an open MRI because I have a heart monitor implant. so I had to do one of those MRIs that looks like a donut hole opening to a tunnel. Was given Versed IV (conscious sedation) to calm me. The MRI was 35 minutes long but it actually only felt like 10 minutes. The nurse who administered the IV was there the whole time monitoring my vital signs. The Versed worked. No side effects, other than being sleepy for a couple of hours when I got home, which they told me to expect that. I never would have made it through that MRI without Versed sedation.",CT
14,Versed,Light Sedation,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 8, 2019",7,"My husband has some mild short-term memory loss after taking Neurontin 2 1/2 years ago.  Last summer, he has had several procedures needing light sedation in which Versed has been used.  It has been effective for unawareness of the procedures themselves, but after each dose, his memory loss seems to be progressively worse.  We will be talking with his PCP about this, and with any future procedures, he will request no sedation or a different medication.",Mountain Gal
15,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 28, 2019",9,"I had a port surgically implanted in my shoulder in March 2016. They used Versed and Fentanyl. I never fell asleep and remembered everything, including each cut of my skin, the implanting, and felt every stitch pulling. Only the Lidocaine was effective to tolerate the procedure. On 09/26/2019 I had a 15-20 minute procedure to take a large amount of bone marrow from large bone that runs horizontally across the low back. Again they gave me Versed and Fentanyl. The Versed did nothing to sedate me or make me sleep. I was fully awake and aware of everything. Again Lidocaine was used at the incision site and I believe the Fentanyl helped me because although I felt most everything I was never in any excruciating pain. Since I was fully coherent, walking and talking, they let me go home right away. Twice now I was given Versed for sedation but it did not work and I have no memory loss. In 2005 it worked for a colonoscopy but not these last times.",Annie
16,Versed,Light Sedation,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 24, 2019",4,"Had Versed for a colonoscopy. I vaguely recall saying ""Ow! ... Ow!"" as some parts of the procedure were very painful.The doc asked me later ""So you don't remember a thing?"" with a smile. I replied ""I remember saying ""Ow"" a lot"" and he brushed that off as me ""dreaming"". I have since learned that making you forget is a major part of why they use this, and yes colonoscopies can be painful. Despite the above I'd still recommend this, as I certainly did forget most of it, and being such an embarrassing procedure I'm glad of that!Didn't have any side effects that I'm aware of.",Biggs
17,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 11, 2019",12,Had a paradoxical reaction. Had anxiety flashbacks for years after. ,KSG5
18,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 15, 2018",12,"I had this during my colonoscopy along with Fentanyl, and I woke up in the middle of it wide awake and feeling a lot of pain. They tried giving me more with no success. Did not work for me.",Lola
19,Versed,Light Sedation,,,"July 7, 2018",7,"I have been thru a lot of spine surgeries and complications with car accident. With permanent damage I get versed for spinal epidurals and trigger point injections every 4 weeks. Obviously I have a tolerance to this.  But even from the beginning, I always fall asleep and relax easily. Once or twice I have I grogginess after and I believe was due to administered more because was soon after surgeries and tolerance was higher. Other than normal tiredness it helps wonderfully get me through the procedure. Don't remember anything and can function few hours later after a long nap. Every person is different and matter how much is administered as with any medication. I would say has high rating doing what it is intended for.",Justme
20,Versed,Light Sedation,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2018",5,Had it for oral surgery IV.  Since then I have had loss of hair.  A fairly large amount.  Just wondered if anyone else had this problem.,Mona Gail

22,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 1, 2017",20,"I was given Versed during a surgery on 12-27-2066, starting on 12-28-20016 and through the next two days I have been having periods when my heart starts beating wildly for no reason and other periods that it seems to slow and flutter.   I needed to return to Dr.'s office for an EKG, but nothing was happening during the time of the test, so he saw nothing. This should pass in time, but who wants to mess with this for days to weeks after surgery? Five days after surgery I still can't focus my eyes together properly, and my vision is still blurry, and I am l a little dizzy. Close up objects are perceived as double.",No Versed For ME!
23,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 10, 2016",10,i highly recomend the non-amnesic fentanyl instead.. see other review,Miki_Ens
24,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 14, 2016",22,I had 3 surgeries within 3 months as a teen. This drug is what the pre-op physician gave me 1-2 minutes prior to wheeling me back into surgery.  It is supposed to calm nerves but it had the opposite effect for me.  I was very nervous about the surgery so I was given syringe of it in my hand 1-2 minutes prior to them wheeling me back.  It caused instant anxiety and impending feelings of doom. I was hyperventilating/blubbering/crying/freaking out as they put me to sleep. My surgeon was in tears and was petting my head to calm me. I ask for no IV pre-sedatives now.,LisaKay91911204
25,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,,"August 9, 2016",31,"Went in to get a celiac plexus block. Was given three doses of versed. Kept telling the docs that I was fully awake, aware, and very anxious because what they were doing hurt considerably. I have been put under for multiple procedures, and know the point when you are starting to go ""out."" This never occurred. They just kept repeating that I was fine and I would ""forget everything."" To which I kept reiterating that I would not and the versed wasn't working. They might as well have given me water in my IV. I ended up jumping off of the table, and had to leave.My main doctor's office that referred me to have the procedure kept telling me that there's no way I would remember anything.Wish that was the case. Would not recommend.",19937839929919
26,Versed,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 25, 2016",20,"Following major jaw surgery, wires and screws were to be removed from my upper jaw, extending all the way to my eye sockets. I arrived at the center, was asked to sit in a dental chair, and had both arms strapped down. I wondered about that.Then, versed was administered. Off to neverland? Never. When I awoke, thinking it was all over, the doctor was quite upset with me. I had unknowingly become agitated and combative and he was unable to begin.Versed didn't work for me. I was very embarrassed to hear how the drug caused me to behave.",L. Camino
27,Versed,Light Sedation,9.0,,"April 1, 2016",15,"I have UC and get a colonoscopy every year...the ONLY good thing about this whole procedure is getting 1 to 2mg of versed in the prep area and just before they give me propofol. I think it's one of the greatest drugs out there, so much euphoria, everything is awesome, calmness, all the anxiety, and any stress you have is gone!!! Wonderful drug, just wish it would last slightly longer. regardless high recommend if your going to get a out patient surgery or in my case a colonoscopy",Alan135

29,Versed,Light Sedation,2.0,,"April 6, 2015",18,"I had a total knee replacement three weeks ago and Versed was used as an amnesia drug while they prepped me, etc. I barely remember anything for the next two and a half days, had short dreams, one in which I was painting and when I woke up, my hand was up and moving like I had a paint brush. I don't remember eating a thing in the hospital, to this day. My friends who visited told me I had chicken, etc., When my Mum and friend came to visit, we were watching television and I asked her who did she find to hang her big screen tv on the wall. She didn't, we were in the hospital. I called my best friend at 3am to ask her if she could come and get me at a friends house, I was in the hospital.  I'll never have this drug used on me again, ever",Mhami
30,Versed,Light Sedation,2.0,,"December 10, 2014",17,Used as a light sedation for cataract surgery.  It was marginally effective during the first procedure and had almost no effect for the second procedure a week later.,guest3333333
31,Versed,Light Sedation,10.0,,"October 3, 2013",13,This was given to me through an IV before an ICD implant. It worked fast and in less than a minute I was totally relaxed and a little sleepy. I don't remember being wheeled into the OR or being put under. Really helped relieve all anxiety I had before surgery.,Heartpatient
32,Versed,Light Sedation,10.0,,"July 11, 2012",32,I was given Versed as a sedation for 3 colonoscopies. It is great. After the procedure I have no grogginess and it is fast acting and doesn't linger throughout the day. My last procedure I was given propofol. It was terrible. I was sick for 2 days. I will definitely have Versed used here on out as long as its available.,kbee
