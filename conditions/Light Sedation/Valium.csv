1,Valium,Light Sedation,9.0,,"September 10, 2019",36,I had an MRI today took valium  2mg 35minutes before it worked great,Alex
2,Valium,Light Sedation,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 17, 2018",12,Was prescribed Valium 2mg to increase sleep quality as I was sleeping with my fists clenched and clenching my jaw. It seemed to put me to sleep but I noticed that I would still wake up a number of times through the night and worse; I was so irritable and angry the next day that everything frustrated me. Only took it for 2 nights. Dr felt that an increased dose would only worsen the symptoms the next day.,bpd789

6,Valium,Light Sedation,9.0,,"June 29, 2011",75,For instant light sedation Valium is the number one choice. It is fast acting even in small dosages like 10mg but for full effect 20mg is preferred. Though it can lead to unwanted dependency after a few weeks so beware.,fettes5
