I have had that before and it has worked they way it was supposed to… I remembered nothing.  But, for some reason, yesterday was different.  They gave me Midazolam and it only made me feel like I had taken a breath of laughing gas… basically it did NOTHING.  It was a terrible experience.  I read my file afterwards and even took photos of it.  They gave me 3 doses of Midazolam equalling 7mg and I was still wide awake and remember every moment of the endoscopy.

The anesthesiologist knew that the first experience I had with an injection in my back went very badly and was extremely painful. After this terrible terrible injection, the anesthesiologist told me he even gave me more Versed because of the previous experience. I’ve felt everything they did and it was excruciatingly painful. I don’t think I can blame the anesthesiologist though. It may just be my reaction to the drug but I’m totally traumatized now and I can’t imagine ever getting a third injection in my back after this experience.

When I had it 10 years ago I remember giggling as I went to sleep. Two days ago when I had it I remember laughing hysterically while they wheeled me down the hall to the OR and saying that Versed was great and that I wanted some to take home with me. I remember continuing to laugh hysterically as I moved onto the OR table, and I also remember looking at the big lights over the OR table and saying, ""This is so cool!"" After that I was out. Hope I didn't annoy the staff too much. I know it knocks me for a loop and makes me very giddy. I stay groggy from it longer than other people, but am totally fine the next day.

I specifically choose a doctor who would sedate my and clearly expressed I did not want to have to feel and remember what was happening. My doctor explained I’d be in a dream like state and not very aware. I remember everything. It didn’t really hurt and they also gave me a bunch of shots of local anesthetic (probably lidocaine but I didn’t ask). It was uncomfortable and I could hear the tooth crack and I still remember the sensation of them twisting my teeth out. I also remember the entire conversation they had while working on me which was very unprofessional ( they were talking about family issues and how they hate the other hospital nearby and stuff like that). I’m now scared to ever need another procedure and I can’t keep replaying the feeling of them twisting my tooth out in my head.,Wisdomtooth

Scope goes in, and I’m gagging and admittedly a little anxious, waiting for the 4mg of Versed to kick in. Nothing. I was fully coherent, aware, anxious and ADHD as always, and attempting to speak during the procedure. I remember it all, could have easily driven myself home. It wasn’t the worst procedure in the world, I’ve got a laundry list of medical traumas, so this was a walk in the park. But still, this drug had absolutely 0 effect on me.

I’m so glad I’m not alone that it didn’t work though. I remember everything. I remember crying under the face mask they had shoved over my eyes, and trying to show my discomfort with my body. They administered more, but it didn’t do anything. It’s terrible. I’m surprised it’s even used after reading all of these. I’m now even more scared of the dentist than I was before.

Was uncomfortable from positioning and kept having waves of impending death. Now I need cataract surgery and allowed them to convince me that the cath experience was due to how gravely ill I was and the fact that it was a lengthy procedure. 1st eye went OK-partial amnesia, no pain but again feeling of impending blindness/death. Procedure only took 10 min which I could deal with. 2nd eye,  another horrific event. After procedure given tylenol and ushered out the door. Sorry state of American health care.

Thankfully the procedure wasn't too painful but the nurses seemed very surprised that I was awake and able to hold a full conversation with them. They asked if I was a heavy drinker (nope) and I do not use drugs recreationally. Strange how I was able to stay fully awake on such a high dosage.

Specialist explained that it would sedate but not put me to sleep because they need you to move around. I told him that I was not sedated AT ALL. The procedure was okay at first but because parts of my bowel has adhesions on the outside, the procedure was extremely painful when they were 'going around corners'.

26,Midazolam,Light Sedation,1.0,,"November 13, 2020",3,"I had a colonoscopy today. The pre procedure written information stated that there would be an hour and a half recovery time from the 'anaesthetic'. The intavenous sedation was in fact Midazolam. Unfortunately it had no effect at all and I was completely conscious during and after wards. I experienced a lot of pain during the colonoscopy which was clearly observed by the consultant and the attending nurses. Afterwards I queried this to the consultant and he responded that all patients get the same dose and that there is no way they can know if it will work with a particular patient or not. He suggested that strong painkillers or sleeping tablets could impede it's effectiveness- neither of these possibilities is relevant in my case.

28,Midazolam,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 18, 2020",5,At 6pm I had Versed 3mg.  I was having a heart cath done so needed to be sedated.  The worse part was the initial plunge of the scope going into my leg.  I was moving my leg so they strapped it.  I told them calmly it was hurting and was assured I would not remember a thing.  I watched the blue meds flowing and saw all of my arteries including 2 previous stents.  I was excited to see no major blockages and know I had one small amount in one artery.  The Dr said the amount was unnecessary to stent.  It hurt terribly when he had to apply pressure to my upper thigh to stop bleeding.  The kind Dr wrote a thorough report.  He talked to me this morning and was shocked at my play by play .  I pray I don’t have to do this again.,Ticking clock

It took me about a half hour to come truly aware of where I was and what was going on with each procedure. I am scheduled for rhizotomies in the next few weeks and look forward to having the versed again. As a teen I had Valium for an upper GI and came to in the middle of it.

How ever although I had a needle inserted at the back of my hand prior to going into the Theater I do not remember or see any one giving the injection.

I vaguely remember telling a story and forgetting what I was trying to say and couldn’t finish my story. I also had taken a selfie and video of myself crying with laughter that I don't recall at all. But I find it quite funny. Even reading through messages I sent is hilarious because I can’t recall sending them. Today I noticed though my memory is still very odd. For example: my dog had walked down the hall and then I was sitting on sofa on phone and then he was sitting beside me. Also, on a call to my friend I had just stopped talking and she had to ask if I was there, and I forgot I was on the phone to her.

The drugs were given and my friend laid comfortably until it was time. The Doc and helper started trying to put his arm in. That's when the screaming began! While under the drugs my friend was communicating (yelling/crying) with the doctor, begging him to put him out. He even told the doctor, ""I'll remember this"".

I had to go back to the OR/ procedure room and get in her face and tell her over and over who I was and that it was ok and that I loved her, calming her, like a child even though she was just over 18 at the time. After about 5 minutes she seemed to snap out of it. But she probably screamed for ten minutes. The sad thing is she had it another time because the oral surgeon insisted it wasn’t the versed before that caused it. He was wrong.  When I first heard her I told them immediately that  I needed to go back, that I could get her to calm down. Never again.

On 09/26/2019 I had a 15-20 minute procedure to take a large amount of bone marrow from large bone that runs horizontally across the low back. Again they gave me Versed and Fentanyl. The Versed did nothing to sedate me or make me sleep. I was fully awake and aware of everything. Again Lidocaine was used at the incision site and I believe the Fentanyl helped me because although I felt most everything I was never in any excruciating pain.

I don't mind getting hungry and eat but the thing is that I go to the kitchen like a zombie, I cook and dropped glass/cups on the floor. Its crazy. One day I woke up with my foot all covered in blood and that happened because I dropped a plate on the kitchen and I stepped on it. I don't remember anything. Besides that I love midazolan.

With permanent damage I get versed for spinal epidurals and trigger point injections every 4 weeks. Obviously I have a tolerance to this.  But even from the beginning, I always fall asleep and relax easily. Once or twice I have I grogginess after and I believe was due to administered more because was soon after surgeries and tolerance was higher. Other than normal tiredness it helps wonderfully get me through the procedure. Don't remember anything and can function few hours later after a long nap.

I must admit that after reading some many negative reviews I was hesitant to take the midazolam, however I was pleasantly surprised, Being a very anxious person I was extremely nervous about getting my wisdom teeth removed, the midazolam worked a treat, it helped a great deal with relief from anxiety, and I was super chilled, nothing really bothered me, I had some interesting time distortions, time passed quicker, was in the dentist chair for about more 45-50 minutes, it felt like 15 minutes. I was a little wobbly on my feet, but could easily get myself about no problems.  No negative after effects, great stuff.",Steve

At first it just made me laugh at bad jokes the doctor made and then I decided to close my eyes and I just fell asleep. It wasn't like a forced sleep like when you take general anesthesia, it felt like a normal sleep at home. Turns out that was so out of it that I was apparently singing the background music the doctor had on the whole time. I woke up really relaxed. Note that I do not speak of the visual part the drug does because I had closed my eyes the whole time to make sure I wouldn't scare myself by seeing a third eye on my doctor which is something she said I might see.",Ant2003

This drug is what the pre-op physician gave me 1-2 minutes prior to wheeling me back into surgery.  It is supposed to calm nerves but it had the opposite effect for me.  I was very nervous about the surgery so I was given syringe of it in my hand 1-2 minutes prior to them wheeling me back.  It caused instant anxiety and impending feelings of doom. I was hyperventilating/blubbering/crying/freaking out as they put me to sleep. My surgeon was in tears and was petting my head to calm me. I ask for no IV pre-sedatives now.,LisaKay91911204
