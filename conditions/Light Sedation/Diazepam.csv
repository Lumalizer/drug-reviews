0,Diazepam,Light Sedation,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 12, 2022",3,"Was very frustrated with doctor fobbing me off as if insomnia wasn't that serious, to me it was having had it for 5 years without a decent nights sleep so sent for diazepam. I could always fall asleep no problem, falling asleep no problem but always woke up 2 hours later wide awake again despite valium. This still happens I don't think people takes this problem seriously enough its very debilitating leaving you washed out permanently.",Valium
1,Diazepam,Light Sedation,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 14, 2021",1,Great medication if you have self control and know the dangers of addiction. I only get 20 X 5mg tablets once every 3 months or so. Sleep guaranteed for 6 hours for me when I take 10mg. Great for stress. But again they are addictive and doctors are getting strict.,Garry
2,Diazepam,Light Sedation,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 10, 2021",1,"This drug is great for getting to sleep but if you have depression and anxiety it should only be used when absolutely necessary. I would take one to two, 4 mgs a week maybe less maybe a bit more. This didn’t seem to effect me but when I had a UTI I was taking 6-10 mg nightly. Huge mistake as it made me feel like I was literally losing my mind one morning. Utter hopelessness, anxiety, sadness , inability to cope with anything. It wore off by the afternoon but it was a nightmare. I felt like I was going mad. Needs to b carefully managed if you have severe depression or anxiety.",Zelly
3,Diazepam,Light Sedation,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 8, 2021",14,"Hi dear people, after being the personal caretaker of my wife for longer than a year I developed an obsessive compulsive disorder by checking each few hours upon her. 24/7 and at night which lead to insomnia for me now, even after her passing away almost 5 months ago! Well and here I am, Valium makes me sleep 10mg. But, I am afraid that I will not be capable to go to work coming Monday! I am drowsy like I never ever was before! I have to work to survive! Anyone had some tips for me? Don't get me wrong, it's a blessing to finally sleep! Valium is the only thing that works for me! Blessings!",Erik

5,Diazepam,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 8, 2020",13,"I am terrified of needles and am getting my wisdom teeth out today. They told me to take a valium the night before and then two day of the surgery. I took the first one, it’s been 2 hours now and I feel not different at all in absolutely any way. I am terrified I’ll go in to the appointment and they won’t have done anything at all, even after two. I haven’t taken a med like this before, so it’s not like I have a tolerance. I don’t know why it hasn’t kicked in",blueslushee

7,Diazepam,Light Sedation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 23, 2019",31,So I have been prescribed valium (a 7 night dose to be taken for 3 or 4 nights then stop for a couple of days then take for remaining nights) This is to help me sleep because I am in pain over the trapped nerve in my neck and have a numb arm My question is this is my 2nd night of taking 2 pills an hour before I go to bed. Both nights nothing has happened. I don't feel drowsy or tired at all. I took tonight's dose two hours ago and still wide awake. Hasn't done anything for muscles relaxing either (actually I didn't realize that was an effect)Any way I want to know why it isn't working. Or is is to just help me sleep more deeply rather than make me tired? I am confused. 1st time I have ever taken it. Or does it take a couple days to work?,Youtnickname
8,Diazepam,Light Sedation,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 21, 2019",22,"I have insomnia.  I have been on Valium, 10mg before bed.  It lets my brain shut off without waking up groggy.  I never use it other than at bed.  I do not have an additive personality.  After seeing a show about withdrawal, I am now a little concerned.  I think I might taper off to see if I can sleep on my own.I am not sure if I have an addiction or not.  I have fallen asleep once in awhile without it.",DZ

10,Diazepam,Light Sedation,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 17, 2018",12,Valium (diazepam):Was prescribed Valium 2mg to increase sleep quality as I was sleeping with my fists clenched and clenching my jaw. It seemed to put me to sleep but I noticed that I would still wake up a number of times through the night and worse; I was so irritable and angry the next day that everything frustrated me. Only took it for 2 nights. Dr felt that an increased dose would only worsen the symptoms the next day.,bpd789

15,Diazepam,Light Sedation,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 24, 2014",50,"Very good! I use it for insomnia and I fall asleep in less than 30 mins after taking 10-15 mg. I sleep for 7 hours after that, a completely recovering sleep and I feel very good and awake the next day! I even don't need my coffee in the morning. ",CrisSpain

18,Diazepam,Light Sedation,9.0,,"June 29, 2011",75,Valium (diazepam):For instant light sedation Valium is the number one choice. It is fast acting even in small dosages like 10mg but for full effect 20mg is preferred. Though it can lead to unwanted dependency after a few weeks so beware.,fettes5
