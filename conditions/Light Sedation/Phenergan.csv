0,Phenergan,Light Sedation,7,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 8, 2022",0,"Started taking this about a year ago it worked ok but gave me awful restless leg syndrome. Did not take it for a while then started again, worked ok for sleep but I felt short tempered and low mood. It is worth a try as everyone reacts differently from it",Brian
1,Phenergan,Light Sedation,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 8, 2021",0,I had taken 25mgs at 22:00 to help  me sleep at 2am took another because still awake! Now 3:30am still awake. I am drowsy but my whole body feels weird kinda irritating sensation it's awful.  I am going to have a cup of tea (caffeine) to see if it will counteract this horrible weird sensation. No more phergan for me that's for sure. I feel I have to move around all the time.,Brooke
2,Phenergan,Light Sedation,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 9, 2021",2,"This medication transformed my life. I have ADHD, I can sleep through the whole night and have been using it for years. It helps me slow down my brain, so I am able to get deeper uninterrupted sleep.",Erla
3,Phenergan,Light Sedation,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 16, 2021",27,"Almost magic, treating insomnia it works better than my ambien & after waking up I won't discover I have emptied the cookie jar or fridge like has happened on ambien a few times. The downside of phenergan is how long it works, yes the next morning there is some lingering fatigue but it fades & coffee clears that fast. For nausea which I get a lot, it also helps without giving you the gift of constipation like zofran does. Phenergan gets an ""A"" rating in my book.",Marty
4,Phenergan,Light Sedation,7,,"January 22, 2020",12,"This does the job for stressful periods of insomnia, but I wouldnâ€™t recommend it if you have something important to wake up for the next morning - one 25mg pill makes me feel drowsy for hours after waking",Oli
5,Phenergan,Light Sedation,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 1, 2019",23,My sleep is terrible.  Phenergan helped but it made me anxious and shivery if I didn't take it and jump into bed straight away to settle.  I'd sleep well but wake the next day feeling like I'd been hit by a truck and low in mood.  It does help with sleep but it's not for me.  Back to insomnia for me.,Maggie Thatcher

9,Phenergan,Light Sedation,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 29, 2012",33,I took the recommended dose and was extremely drowsy yet angry and restless. It was like I wanted to scream out of frustration but was too tired and edgy. ,Anonymous
10,Phenergan,Light Sedation,10,,"August 31, 2011",45,"This is my magic pill.  I suffer from vertigo, chronic spinal pain, sleeplessness, mild depression because of the spinal pain, and usually I get sick to my stomach with even one aspirin. I take 1/2 of one pill of this every night before bed and sleep like a baby and awake feeling rested, happy, and nausea-free.  I hope the vertigo is gone too but haven't taken this long enough to know about that.  I take small doses of everything because I feel the effects of any medicine very strongly.  WHY hasn't a doctor offered this to me before?",Anonymous
