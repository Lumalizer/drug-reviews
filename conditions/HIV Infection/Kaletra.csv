1,Kaletra,HIV Infection,8,,"October 4, 2009",8,"Since I've been changed to Viread/ Epivir/ + Kaletra, my viral load has remained constantly Undetecable for ~4 Yrs;  my T-cell count went from 210 to 325 very quickly; in the last year, with no changes to anything my V-load remains undetectable & my T-cell count has soared to 725!!!  Sounds fantastic.  However, during this same period of rapid TC rise I have slowly become more & more tired, weak, & my bones ache from head to toe.  I no longer have the strength to ride my horse or even do the yard work.  My Doctor believes I may be suffering from Lactic Acidosis.  But he is convinced that it is because of the Viread ~ NOT because of the Kaletra.  I will now be replacing Viread with Abacavir & CONTINUE taking Kaletra.   Hope it works.",Anonymous
