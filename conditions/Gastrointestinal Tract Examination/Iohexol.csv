0,Iohexol,Gastrointestinal Tract Examination,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 9, 2021",3,"Despite having a warning for imaging dyes on my MedAlert Card, the ER doctors ignored that warning and sold me on having a CT scan for a dull lower left GI discomfort, not a much safer MRI. Otherwise I was fine. The adverse neurologic events began within hours after getting home. On the third day I suffered a large explosion in my head. I went instantly blind in my left eye due to massive instantaneous retinal/macular pucker/damage, (I was 20/20 before. Eyesight never returned.) In addition I suffered Vestibular damage, instability, chronic balance disorder, ataxia, severe nightmarish tinnitus that's nonstop, chronic cluster migraine headache with aura etc etc. My life became a living nightmare. They do not care, I was nothing but a $ figure to them. I now am bedridden... from being fully active to a severely injured person. My treating physicians at Johns Hopkins fully concur that it was Omnipaque that did it.",Cappy
