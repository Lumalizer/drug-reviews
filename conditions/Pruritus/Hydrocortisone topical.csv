3,Hydrocortisone topical,Pruritus,,,"September 27, 2011",9,We have a lot of mosquitoes in our area. They are very attracted to me and I develop quarter sized bumps shortly after being bitten.  I have found that if I apply Hydrocortisone 1% cream to a mosquito bite as soon as possible the swelling and itching will be relieved within minutes.  It is important to apply the cream prior to scratching the bite.  I highly recommend using this cream; it makes my life here tolerable.,Anonymous
