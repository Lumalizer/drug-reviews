0,Diphenhydramine,Pruritus,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 31, 2019",5,"I have 2nd degree sunburns, sun blisters all over my body, not a fun time. I haven't been able to sleep for a week. Burns are now starting to go away after 4 or 5 days of bad pain, and the itching is going crazy. Took two pills, within 15 minutes, the itching is gone. Within 30 minutes I'm out cold. Wake up 3 hours later, make dinner, and in due time ready to take next dosage. Makes me feel extremely tired, so I go to bed, woke up 11 hours earlier. Such a life saver, just improved my sleep amount from 5 to 11 hours. Thank you modern medicine!",ToastyBurns

2,Diphenhydramine,Pruritus,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 10, 2019",0,"The doctor ordered 50 ccs of Benadryl when I was in the ER for a bad breakout ofEczema among other things. As soon as the medicine got in my veins-I was useless! My mouth got instantly dry, I couldn’t speak anyway. It felt like it does when they put you to sleep. I was out for 3 hrs in the ER! I received a couple phone calls while I was there and didn’t remember them after. Luckily I didn’t drive myself there, but I felt strange the rest of the day. It definitely stopped the itching because I wasn’t awake to feel it!!",Suzyq
