0,Cetirizine,Eustachian Tube Dysfunction,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 25, 2022",5,"I've had a hellish experience with eustachian tube dysfunction for the past few days and trying different antihistamines just to stop it and none worked. Then I took cetirizine. 15-30 mins later ALL HEALED. JUST LIKE THAT. Amazing. Just a point to look out for, sometimes it can make you drowsy, so look out for that.",Hewo
