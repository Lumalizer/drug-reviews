I felt immediate relief after first day. For me however, I eat a brat diet while on Carafate which is bananas, rice, applesauce and toast. Bland diet. Pain gone. Stomach healing.

1,Sucralfate,Stomatitis,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 2, 2018",11,"Took my chest and back pain away which were INTENSE from the GERD. However, I was barely able to stand up and walk to and from the bathroom by day 4 without feeling dizzy and nauseas. I felt forgetful and the vertigo was becoming debilitating. I do not recommend this for anything other than treating be actual ulcer if and when itâ€™s diagnosed through an upper GI series.",Annie
