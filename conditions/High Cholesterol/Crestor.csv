0,Crestor,High Cholesterol,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 30, 2021",2,"I’ve taken both Crestor( Rossuvastation) and Atorvastation and both have made my joints and muscles ache like mad. So much so in fact that I have trouble getting in and out of the car and when walking downstairs I feel like my legs could buckle at any second. Other side effects are spells of dizziness, loss of balance and a distended stomach.My 2 teenage sons have noticed a material impact on my mobility and have said I hobble around like a 90 year old.I’ve been on the tabs for 3 months but have had enough and I’m stopping them today. I will report back with hopefully better news on the mobility front. Let’s just hope I don’t keel over with a heart attack in the interim. I’ve also asked my doctor about a new cholesterol reducing injection I’ve read about but not sure if it’s mainstream enough yet.JohnUK",Jweare
1,Crestor,High Cholesterol,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 8, 2021",3,"After much resistance I decided to try a statin to lower my cholesterol. I tried to give a chance but the stomach pains were worrisome. I even tried cutting the 5 mg dose in half, but this didn’t help. After stopping there is a huge improvement in my stomach issues.",Anonymous
2,Crestor,High Cholesterol,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 20, 2021",9,"I was on Crestor for several years. I was also on Wellbutrin for depression, Trazodone for insomnia, and Topamax for headaches. In 2020, my headaches got steadily worse. By the beginning of 2021, I was on 4 migraine meds and nothing was helping. Then my doctor took me off Crestor and started me on Zetia instead. Within a few weeks, I started falling asleep in the evenings without Trazodone. Then I noticed my headaches were less frequent and I was in a better mood throughout the day. I was able to stop taking 6 meds — my antidepressant, my sleeping med, and 4 migraine meds — because almost everything I was being treated for was a side-effect of Crestor. I had been on so many meds, and I still felt awful all the time because of Crestor. I spent thousands of dollars in therapy trying to figure out why I was so depressed. My relationship with my husband was stressful, because I had absolutely no sex drive. Crestor cost me dearly for the past decade. I would never recommend this drug.",TCR07

4,Crestor,High Cholesterol,8.0,,"December 15, 2020",33,"My prescribed dosage, which I stuck with for 5 years until I reduced it, was 1x20mg per day. This eventually resulted in severe Hip/Leg pain which greatly reduced my ability to walk. Being very obese, I did not need any decreased mobility. After a period of experimenting based on my own research, not the doctor's, I have arrived at a dosage level that prevents angina, lowers my cholesterol to a level my doctor is happy with. I am now taking 6x20 tablets p/wk. That is not a big decrease, but it seems to be enough to almost completely stop the intense pain I was suffering. I have investigated/experimented with the reduced dosage extensively, and is the ""happy medium"". For me, it is a good drug, if used at the right level. Without it completely, I know I would be experiencing heart/circulation problems. Prior to me making my own decisions about dosage level, my previous doctor told me that I would need a hip replacement. I have since changed doctors, and am happy with the adjusted dose.",Hip to be square
5,Crestor,High Cholesterol,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 15, 2020",16,"Between Crestor and Lipitor, Lipitor was the one that gave me the side effects, cramps that felt like an UTI. Insomnia and a few other muscle pain here and there. Also felt it affected the libido. Doctor switched me to Crestor, so far no side affects, maybe some bizarre dreams that some will describe as nightmares, but I live dreaming any type of dream.....lol....I believe finding the right statin might take a few different brands until you find the right one.

Tried it again and had side effects of gained weight, my GERD increased, had trouble getting my legs to move, nightmares, intermittent blurred vision, increased left hip pain so I had to curl my leg up in bed instead of leaving it straight which caused pain. I had a hard time driving due to blurry vision. Crestor is an expensive medicine. Because the HDL cholesterol number are decreased, well, I don't know if we know enough about cholesterol to know how much it helps.  Could not stay on it long enough to see if helped the HDL.",cjg

50,Crestor,High Cholesterol,10.0,,"April 5, 2016",402,"I'm 45 years old and have always felt like I was in good health.  Non-smoker and have never had a weight problem.  However, blood tests from the last few years have revealed that I have a problem with high cholesterol and triglycerides.  Eight weeks ago, when my triglyceride number was a shocking 583 and LDL over 200, my doctor insisted that I needed some help to bring these numbers into a healthy range.  Reluctantly, I agreed.  I was prescribed 20mg of Crestor daily at bedtime.  It scared me to death to read reviews on Crestor and statin drugs in general and I almost didn't even give it a chance but also committed to making some changes in lifestyle.  For example, I started skipping most of the sweet, fatty foods and actually paying attention to serving sizes and TRYING to stick closer to recommended allowances.  I have also been going on brisk, half-hour walks at least 5 days a week.  Nothing tremendously difficult but something that has required consistency.  After eight weeks of using Crestor and living a little differently, I am happy to report that my Triglycerides are now down to a mere 67 and my LDL level is down to 57.  I’ve also lost 15lbs and I wasn’t overweight to begin with.  I expected the numbers to show improvement but I was shocked to see them this good!  What's more is that I have not noticed any of the negative side effects mentioned by so many.  Trust me, I was looking out for those for any excuse to stop taking it.  I will mention a positive side effect I was not expecting.  I've been burdened with IBS (irritable Bowel Syndrome) for many years.  I've just lived with it and been careful about how long I might be away from a bathroom.  Interestingly enough, since I have been on Crestor, I have been much more regular and, well, solid.  Maybe that is TMI but I have appreciated the change.  People seem to be more motivated to write a review about anything if they are displeased.  I'm taking a different approach, my experience with Crestor, so far, has been very good and I am very excited about the results.",Pikester

My only concern is there is no generic alternative and it is VERY expensive when the insurance companies declare that it's not in their formulary of preventive medications.  I've been lucky that my PCP has been able to convince the ins co that I can't tolerate an alternative, so have not had to pay for the medication for the past several years (treated as preventative).
