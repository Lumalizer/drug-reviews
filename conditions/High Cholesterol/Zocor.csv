0,Zocor,High Cholesterol,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 12, 2022",0,"I was prescribed simvastatin and took it daily for 3 years.  I have been diagnosed with a condition ""Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome"" back in 2007.  I have been on Nexium for that diagnosis, and due to High Blood Pressure, I take Metoprolol and Lisinopril and have been since 2013.  2015 is when I was prescribed Simvastatin (Zocor) for High Cholestorol.  Before the Zocor, I was only having an CVS episode approximately every 2 to 3 months and the episode would only be for 2 to 3 days.  After the Zorco, I was having CVS episodes almost every month, and they were so bad I would have to go to the hospital and would need fluids. I would be in the hospital about 5 to 7 days.  In 2018 I lost my job for being absent due to illness so often and lost my insurance as well.  So I made a decision to only get the medicines I needed most.  I stopped the Zocor, and about 3 weeks later I stopped having CVS episodes so often, they are now down to about 2 a year, and haven't been to the hospital since.",Dedi

3,Zocor,High Cholesterol,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 29, 2015",61,"Started this med about 11 years ago.  It dropped my level to below avg.  I always associated my aches and pains to my age and activity level, but I've discontinued its use for about 3 weeks because my finger joints felt swollen and arthritic.  I'm starting to feel a slow improvement.  My additional symptoms are sore hips and other joints.  To be fair, I won't be able to discern whether this is the drug or some other factor until staying off it longer.",JohnGotts

12,Zocor,High Cholesterol,1.0,,"October 1, 2010",116,"This medication landed me in the ER after a week. I was having so much back pain that I could not stand or walk. I was wheeled in. The pain was so severe they had to use Dilaudid to bring it down and send me home on it for several days. I have always had back pain so I was not sure at first that this was the cause. I am now. I figure I can not take ""Statins"" and currently take nothing. I can take Zetia if I have to. It felt like my back was bone on bone. All my disc felt out in my lower back and crushed. The most pain I had been in ever. Probably a good drug for some but not for me.",Anonymous
