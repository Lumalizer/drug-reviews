0,Pravastatin,High Cholesterol,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 11, 2022",2,"Cholesterol was 4.2 when I started 10 mg  Pravastatin 1 tablet to be taken at night. Was on it 17 months. It gave me very severe pain on right side of the back area with spacey feeling, insomnia and very low sex drive. Also was causing left leg to buckle when walking with fatigue and very low energy causing me to feel generally unwell and unable to excercise. I am male with normal blood pressure and otherwise healthy and was walking 5 miles every day before medicine. 10 mg Pravastatin was not effective at maintaining or lowering cholesterol as it was 5 on a blood test. I stopped taking Pravastatin because of the side effects and the right back pain took about 6 weeks to resolve. When the cholesterol was done again after being off the tablet 6 weeks the cholesterol was 4.",Again

Also I have developed a horrible rash under my breasts which I never had before. Now that I stopped the pravastatin it seems to be going away. I don't know what to do because I think that I need a statin because of clogged arteries and high cholesterol but the side effects were too much to handle.

16,Pravastatin,High Cholesterol,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 22, 2020",43,"I started Pravastatin over five years ago and it did lower my bad cholesterol.  However, my legs began aching badly after a few years.  I attributed it to my lower back pain until I had a procedure for my back that burned the nerves. This  helped my back but didn't help my never ending leg pain.   My upper and lower leg muscles burned and ached, the back of my knees and ankles hurt to the point that it was hard to walk, and my urine turned brown.  My doctor stopped the Pravastatin and the pain  gradually lightened, giving me hope that it will eventually stop.  It has been three weeks and I hope to be off pain pills eventually.  Never again will I take a statin.  It did its best to debilitate me completely but it did lower my cholesterol.  The price of pain was too high.",Eddie
