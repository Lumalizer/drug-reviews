An ophthalmologist confirms I have floaters and some bleeding behind the eye retina.I’m devastated that my vision is impaired and I have this bleeding, I asked the ophthalmologist if the niacin could’ve been the cause and she says it’s quite possible.

5,Niacin,High Cholesterol,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 27, 2019",4,Niaspan (niacin):I have been taking Niaspan 2000 for the last 8 years with ok results. But the last time I went to the Dr. my cholesterol was 220.  The Dr put me on Zetia since I cannot take statins. Unfortunately Zetia had the same reaction on my body as statins. Terrible joint pain. After only 10 days I had to stop. I was hoping it would be the answer but it wasn't. I went back on Niaspan. I watch what I eat and have been a vegetarian for 45 years. Dr said it was hereditary that my liver makes too much cholesterol and it was not my diet. I am at the end of my rope now if the Niaspan stops working. Suggestions?,Jan

7,Niacin,High Cholesterol,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 22, 2017",12,"I started taking niacin to increase HDL and lower LDL because I suffered a heart attack a couple of years ago.  It did raise my HDL and Lower the LDL a bit, but not all that much.  HOWEVER, I noted an unexpected benefit.  For years I would wake in the middle of night to go to the bathroom and found I was soaked in sweat.  I was having disturbing dreams.  They weren't terrible.  Most dreams consisted of things like parking my car in a large lot and not being able to find it.  Also being lost in a strange city.  Or, getting a new job and not having a clue what I was doing while trying to prevent my boss from finding out how confused I was.  Once I started the niacin the strange dream were gone as were the night sweats.",Michael Parish

15,Niacin,High Cholesterol,4.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 18, 2014",12,Niaspan (niacin):Off it completely for 2 days now. Acid reflux much better and more importantly no Pronounced heart beats or racing. Feeling normal again thank God. I truly believe after my experience with both Niaspan and Crestor is that they actually starve your heart of the Oxygen it needs if your an athlete. Heart rate problems or potential Arrhythmia's may not be revealed in people who have more sedentary lifestyles. The fact that the new recommendation is to stack COQ10 with the statins should prove that they can rob your heart of energy when you work it hard during intense exercise. ,Trainhard

Then as an active person who is involved in teaching Cardio Boxing classes I began to experience weird feelings in my chest along with a more pronounced heart beat during and after exercise. Felt like I swallowed a Basketball at times. Also could not have any alcohol Beer or Wine while taking this. I decided to stop taking it in fear of creating an Arrythmyia or Stroke during my exercise which also is my Job. This is day one off of it and feel better.",Trainhard

20,Niacin,High Cholesterol,8.0,,"July 29, 2013",41,Niaspan (niacin):Age 51. Went to get my regular bloodwork with my Doctor. My cholestral has always been >200 and have a family history of Heart Attack and stroke. I tried everything over the years including Crestor which was an absolute disaster for me after only 4 doses. Since then tried the natural methods Red Yeast Rice (may as well be on a statin the side effects are basically the same) and lots of fish and Krill oil. I was disappointed that my bad cholesterol was high after all that still and my number was 219 total. Based on my unwillingness to try another Statin my Dr. suggested a 500mg pill of Niaspan to be taken nightly. I have experienced no flushing as yet after a month on it and really no bad side effects.

She then suggested 500 mg of Slo-Niacin twice a day with a baby aspirin.  I started it but in a few days I was terribly constipated.  I backed off to once a day which helped.  Then I started taking potassium iodine (kelp) and the constipation problem is completely solved - better than ever as I've always been constipated - probably slow thyroid.  Anyway, when I was taking the two Slo-Niacins a day, I felt 20 years younger.  Going up a flight of stairs felt like walking on a flat surface.  Now one a day so I only feel 10 years younger.
