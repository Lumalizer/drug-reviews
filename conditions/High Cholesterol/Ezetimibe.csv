In less than 4 weeks on this drug, I lost complete use of my right arm and knee, had severe back pain, the bloating was so bad that it pushed up against my chest wall, then the pain went into my chest and under my breasts, the final thing that happened that convinced me to never take another cholesterol drug was lightning bolts in my heart; that was scary!! The sad thing about this drug was the cost, $173.99 with insurance for 3 months, spoke to CVS and there's nothing they can do, I wasted $173.99 and have 2 1/2 months of this drug left. I'm sharing this to warn you, this drug is so awful and it's very expensive, will damage your heart muscle, kidneys and liver; I prefer to change my diet and lose some weight, not worth the risks nor the pain it causes.

18,Ezetimibe,High Cholesterol,10.0,,"January 29, 2021",5,"After heart attack, I started Vytorin (Zetia & Zocor).  My total cholesterol dropped to 120. When components went generic, I took Ezetimibe and Symvastatin.  My first Ezetimibe was from Impax labs. I had about 2 weeks of diarrhea in conjunction with the change.  I got back on Vytorin for 3 months and diarrhea promptly cleared up.  Guessing all generics are not exactly the same, I found different manufacturing for Ezetimibe via Walgreens, and had no problems since. Doctor ran experiment for three months by dropping Ezetimibe, and my total cholesterol went up to 135.  I got back on Ezetimibe and my cholesterol went back down.  I concluded the combination works well for me.  I take it and my other medications during evening soon after dinner with small amount of food.
