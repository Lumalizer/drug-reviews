0,Simvastatin,High Cholesterol,,,"March 20, 2022",0,"I've been on Simvastatin about a month.  I have experienced foot & leg cramps, mostly at night, sleepless nights, maybe some memory issues, back & chest pain.  I just spent several days in the hospital because of chest pain which I had never experienced before.   When I had upper right severe back pain (not spinal) I was also very light headed and my legs stayed quite weak for over two days.  I believe I'll work on my diet, stop the simvastatin, and pray that The Lord grants me the wisdom to care for my body in a reasonable manner.  I'm 81 & not too shabby physically.",Ivory
1,Simvastatin,High Cholesterol,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 12, 2022",0,"Zocor (simvastatin):I was prescribed simvastatin and took it daily for 3 years.  I have been diagnosed with a condition ""Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome"" back in 2007.  I have been on Nexium for that diagnosis, and due to High Blood Pressure, I take Metoprolol and Lisinopril and have been since 2013.  2015 is when I was prescribed Simvastatin (Zocor) for High Cholestorol.  Before the Zocor, I was only having an CVS episode approximately every 2 to 3 months and the episode would only be for 2 to 3 days.  After the Zorco, I was having CVS episodes almost every month, and they were so bad I would have to go to the hospital and would need fluids. I would be in the hospital about 5 to 7 days.  In 2018 I lost my job for being absent due to illness so often and lost my insurance as well.  So I made a decision to only get the medicines I needed most.  I stopped the Zocor, and about 3 weeks later I stopped having CVS episodes so often, they are now down to about 2 a year, and haven't been to the hospital since.",Dedi
2,Simvastatin,High Cholesterol,,,"June 15, 2021",24,"If anyone is on any type of cholesterol medication...GET OFF OF IT AND STAY OFF!!!  My husband died from this!!!Any cholesterol medication shuts down the part of your liver that produces cholesterol.  So now you're not getting what the liver was intended for.  Since the part of your liver is shut down, it also isn't filtering other things you put into your body, such as other medication. 2003 January my husband received a clear bill of health, retired in 2003 February,  2003 February 19th he turned 55 taking full 100% of his retirement.  2003 May 3rd HE DIED FROM MEDICATION TOXICITY!!!BUT, because no other claims about the cholesterol medication had been made, I COULD NOT SUE!!! Now I live on disability and widows pension no where near what his retirement plan should be paying. So, think of my life the next time you hear of someone taking the cholesterol medication or you being offered this by your doctor",Nahnie5

I started taking it last night, my first ever pill 10mg, I started experiencing a burning chest and I was feeling kinda funny. It wasn’t a good feeling as I was struggling to sleep too. Woke up with a burning chest, since the pill is still in my system. I’m going to see a different Dr and explain the symptoms. Surely there’s something I can replace the simvastatin 10mg with.

I am a 72 year old retired registered nurse.  I first started waking up in the middle of the night with horrible cramps in my legs, it felt as if a knife was sticking in my leg. Then I developed a rash under my breasts which after being prescribed 4 different creams just got worse. Then I got gout in my big toe and when I woke up in the morning my feet felt numb.

9,Simvastatin,High Cholesterol,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 22, 2020",6,"So I was a STEMI and after stent insertion, I was put on Simvastatin.  I have been taking it for almost 18 months.  Over the last couple of months I began developing pain in my hips, thighs and knees with some lower back pain.  I thought perhaps it could be sciatica.  Saw Cardiologist a week ago and talked about the pain.  He said highly likely it is Simvastatin.  He said to stop it for 3 - 5 days, go back on and report how I felt to him.  Well day 2 off the pain was almost gone.  Day 3, pain completely gone.  I asked Dr. why after all this time?  It can build up in your system.  So day 3 back on Simvastatin and pain is slowly returning to my knees and hips.  He is talking about injectable Repatha (not sure if I can afford that).  My Cholesterol was great.  Right where he wanted it to be.",LO

I started on 10 mg and presently take 40 mg. My cholesterol has been reduced but the discomfort associated with coldness at all times regardless of temperature and amount of clothing worn is very disconcerting. I have discussed this with several doctors and they all say its a side effect of ZOCOR. I cannot find this in the list of published side effects.

The latest is the generic simvastatin . Muscle soreness in legs, hips, wrists have seemed to be my life. Up every two hours to pee like clockwork, sometimes more irritable for no apparent reason and irregular heart beats I can feel, and are picked up by my BP machine. After reading these reviews, I'm going to self de-medicate for a spell to see if my sleep pattern changes as well as other possible side effects I've listed. It seems too many people have the same symptoms as me, and have stopped taking the medication with positive results.",door2

After taking it as prescribed for several months,  my cholesterol levels did reduce to healthy levels.  I continued the treatment,  until I realized that nothing I was eating tasted right.  I consulted my Pharmacist because I take other medications,  and he said it was the statin that had this side-effect.  I stopped taking it immediately,  and my taste has returned to normal,  and my cholesterol is elevated again.  I will be trying other methods to increase HDL and reduce LDL.

29,Simvastatin,High Cholesterol,1.0,,"April 15, 2017",32,"Was prescribed this by endocrinologist who was not aware that this drug causes major spikes in blood sugar. I had to increase the amount of insulin I was taking by about 10 fold.  This is dangerous because studies have confirmed that high doses of insulin are related to heart disease. So the very disease this is designed to help improve (heart disease) by lowering cholesterol, his drug actually could make heart disease worse (increase my diabetes) Had I stayed on this drug, I'd be dead in a year. No one, especially diabetics, should ever take this drug. It is dangerous and life threatening. I had muscle cramps and felt horrible. This should be off the market. Manage high cholestoral with diet, skip the drugs. I'm convinced this drug led to a family member's kidney and heart failure.",Roburpa
