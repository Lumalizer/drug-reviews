0,Lovastatin,High Cholesterol,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 21, 2021",1,"Lovastatin has helped me keep my cholesterol in check.  I have had no side effects whatsoever. I also have two friends taking it. One, like me, has been taking it very long term with no side effects. The other had muscular issues and switched to something else but I don't know what it was.  For me, it's been great!",Denny
1,Lovastatin,High Cholesterol,8,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 18, 2018",19,"I have taken 20mg lovastatin for over 25 years.  Wondering if I really needed it, so stopped taking it for 6 months last year and blood work was all bad:  Chol 196 to 243HDL  52 to 49LDL  106 to 145Trig  188 to 246All of the above varied very little during the 25+ years on the drug, so back on it for nearly a year and looking forward to next blood work.  Also, never experienced any side effects that I'm aware of.",Russ
2,Lovastatin,High Cholesterol,8,,"January 2, 2018",5,"I've lost 25lbs. in the past 6 months. The weekend after Thanksgiving I got a strange pain in my stomach and threw up, felt sick for the next 2 days so I thought I had the flu. I never really did get my appetite back. The day after Christmas the same pain came back, which made me throw up 10 times worse. I am now due for my physical, but that is why I was asking, since I lost weight, would 20mg lovastatin be making me sick?",Janette T.
3,Lovastatin,High Cholesterol,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 13, 2017",9,"10th day in of taking this, woke up to severe muscle pain in both legs, shoulder hand and wrist, now at 3 wk mark. Still in pain have been using a walker to get around, showing slight improvement, how long does this take to get back to normal, it's been horrible.",gig1327
4,Lovastatin,High Cholesterol,1,,"July 12, 2017",8,"Two pills almost killed me.  Left me bedridden for a week.  I couldn't even lift my arm to call 911.After 5 days, managed to call my doctor.  They dismissed my symptoms.I hadn't drank or urinated for days.  When I finally did, my pee was Brown (this stuff destroyed your muscles).I will NEVER take another statin as long as I live.",Peter Abbott

8,Lovastatin,High Cholesterol,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 14, 2014",34,Mevacor (lovastatin):This worked better than Lipitor.  I changed due to cost and my blood work is beyond excellent.  I've had no adverse side effects. ,Zanesgrammy
9,Lovastatin,High Cholesterol,9,,"March 30, 2012",27,Constipation is my number one problem. I drink 8oz of prune juice every other day and the problem is 100% solved.,Horsecreeker
10,Lovastatin,High Cholesterol,1,,"November 1, 2011",55,"Mevacor (lovastatin):Lowered cholesterol about 65% as well as Lipitor. Had eventual adverse effects after 1.5 years of use. Caused extreme joint and muscle tendon pain in the fingers, hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, thighs and knees. This was with the typical starting dosage for Mevacor. Lipitor has NOT had any side effects for me in over a decade of use. Different statins have different effects on different individuals, but Mevacor's side effects were crippling for me until I discontinued use. About a year later, I began 20 mg of Lipitor.",wwaldok
11,Lovastatin,High Cholesterol,10,,"March 2, 2011",86,"Altoprev (lovastatin):I have never had any major side effects with this medicine.  I would say it is probably the best on the market, though it is expensive. When I was on another medication related to statins my eyes were RED, and they hurt.  My heart ached and I felt like my days were numbed.  I asked my doctor to switch me back to Altoprev and I am back to normal, full of energy, my eyes are clear and the heart pains went away.  I highly recommend this to anyone suffering from high cholesterol.",Anonymous
