Starting at 40mg my LDL cholesterol level dropped dramatically, and my HDL climbed slightly.

Short term memory almost non-existent; large gaps in long term memory.  I’d meet someone on the street whom I’d worked with for 20 years and could not remember their name.It also made me a very nasty, rude, insulting person.  I lost several good friends because of nasty things I said, and destroyed a 20 year relationship.  My wife threatened to leave me if I didn’t stop taking it.  I stopped, my cholesterol went high again, and I don’t care.  That was ten years ago, and my short term memory has pretty much returned, but there are still large gaps in long term memory.   I don’t care how high my cholesterol goes; I will never take another statin.",Craigboy53

66,Lipitor,High Cholesterol,1.0,,"September 21, 2009",283,"I was taking the combination drug Caduet, of which Lipitor was one of the two drugs. Steadily over a year my doctor increased the medication from 20mg to 40mg, and then about three months ago he increased it to 80mg. Within a month I was experienceing severe tiredness, and eventually sever muscle weakness, coupled with elevated CK readings. On doing some research on the drug I found that the symptoms I had were indeed a major drug reaction. Although Lipitor helped in the reduction of my cholesterol levels, the side effects were debilitating. Within a week of having the medication changed to a non-statin I was beginning to feel better. A month later I am close to being back to my old self. There are other better alternatives.",Anonymous
