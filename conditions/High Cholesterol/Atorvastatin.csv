Was due for a follow up visit at 6 months so I just continued thinking my body would adjust. It had become so bad that I told my husband that if this was how my life was going to be from here on out, I was just ready to die, that is how poor my quality of life had become. During the 6 months, I worked hard to lose 30 pounds eating clean, also eliminating dairy and gluten, and develop an exercise regimen to include cardio and resistance training. I added CoQ10 and magnesium supplements but didn’t see any relief from the symptoms.

I took it for a month and a half, but started getting red blotches on my skin.  These hives appeared everywhere on my body. The itch was horrendous.  I didn't see the correlation between the drug and the blotches until my wife googled my condition.  I was having an allergic reaction to the Atorvastatin. It was  CIU (Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria). A ""living nightmare"" I was experiencing! My wife advised me to get off of it and for one week, no problems. But my Doctor advised against it. Got back on it and the hives came back with a vengeance. Hopefully, this drug will soon be exorcised from my body (metaphorically speaking of course), and I will be able to get back to some sort of normalcy? People, be careful if you take this drug!

Stopped after 9 days and things are improving slowly.These drugs stop the essential HMG-CoA pathway in the body which produces many molecules that are essential for cellular health. They also build up in muscle tissue in their toxic lactone form. This is especially serious if you have an acidic blood pH. There are genetic variations in the bodies ability to clear these through the liver that can lead to a dangerous build-up of these drugs in your body. This basic biology is all hard science and confirmed by peer-reviewed studies.Educate yourself and make your own decision before letting your doctor scare you into taking these dangerous drugs.",rivervan

There is also a handful who claim that statins are ""poison"" and ""should be taken off the market"".  This is, clearly, an overreaction by those who have the adverse reaction, which - despite what you would think from reading these reviews - are very low frequency events.  Statins are probably as close to a wonder drug as modern pharmacology has ever gotten.  Yes, there are those who are intolerant, allergic, or simply confused as to the genesis of their symptoms.  The truth is, statins work for the vast majority of people taking them, and they work well.  Having said this, I am also perplexed as to why some folks in their later 70s or even 80s are taking them?",98zeitgeist78
