0,Vytorin,High Cholesterol,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 12, 2019",13,"I had heart problems from the age of 50, well first heart attack. Then I was a test rabbit for the hospital with new coated stents. I had four over a couple of years. I even died on the table but thank God I came back. I am 64 and had a heart attack at 62 years  I had surgery on my heart. Then they gave me Vytorin 10-40. I have had nothing but pain in my muscles memory problems and stomach problems. So stopped the drug and have changed my diet, I have never felt so good. Don't take this drug. ",big o
1,Vytorin,High Cholesterol,1,,"December 2, 2018",10,"Don't take this. It was introduced in 2004 and I was forced to use it in 2006 by a physician who knew no more about it than I did and I'm an engineer. All he knew was that he was being paid 200K a year to get people to take it. Since I had heart surgery, taking all sorts of recovery drugs, nobody knew what was causing all of the side effects we finally found were being caused by this 1 drug. Only a small test was done on this drug and it was found to not work as intended and caused many side effects. As such, the drug companies hid the drug study under the rug to avoid law suits. I saw many doctors over this, then found out one day in 2008 at my pharmacist that he had just received a national warning that the drug was toxic, found not to work as advertised, and the drug companies had hidden the test results to avoid law suits. No success in suing, but 1 of my engineering associates died and 2 of my cousin's employees died as a result of ingesting this poison.",Washington
2,Vytorin,High Cholesterol,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 14, 2018",8,Excellent results in just 14 days on the dose 10/20.  My levels have gone from 270 to 160.,Xo
3,Vytorin,High Cholesterol,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 23, 2018",3,Prescribed Vytorin around 2003. It worked well on keeping cholesterol in check. Never went into the red using this drug. It did seem to have an effect on HDL keeping it in the mid to high 40â€™s. New Doctor took me off Vytorin and cholesterol is stable but HDL dropped 10 points.,Greg
4,Vytorin,High Cholesterol,10,,"November 4, 2016",8,Vytorin took my cholesterol from 300 to 125 with just a half of a 10/40 tablet. Excellent results for what is considered to be a half dose.,Rwd681
5,Vytorin,High Cholesterol,10,,"July 6, 2014",23,"My cholesterol had been over 300 for years. We (myself & Dr.) tried diet from a nutritionist along with my regular exercise, cholesterol, no change. We then went to medication. After three different meds, which two did lower the count, but not enough to really matter. So, a year or so later my doctor ask if I was willing to try Vytorin, and I said, Why not. After being on Vytorin for approximately 2 1/2 months I was scheduled for my routine blood work-up and when the results came back I was shocked when the doctor read the results. My LDL was below 100 and the HDL was up to 75. I have been on Vytorin for about 6 years and I never worry about my cholesterol. I try to eat healthy, but I no longer worry about or read food labels.",Gary 692
6,Vytorin,High Cholesterol,3,,"December 29, 2011",35,This medicine reduced my cholesterol but gave me abdominal pain as well as muscle cramps and weight gain.  ,jellydounut
7,Vytorin,High Cholesterol,9,,"October 11, 2011",42,"Everyone in my family has exceptionally high cholesterol, in the 370 range. We produce it. Don't let anyone tell you that you have a bad diet if your cholesterol is high. It is produced by the body and in some people, apparently including me, reduced cholesterol intake results in increased cholesterol production. For several years I was on Lipitor; it never lowered my cholesterol reading below 280. I've used Vytorin 10-40 for probably eight years with no ill side effects. Vytorin took it down to 170 or less. The government contends Vytorin is no more effective than anything else in lowering cholesterol. They've never tested me, of course. Now, because of the government's position, I find Vytorin dropped from my Medicare plan. I'm switching.",cwpnewpaltz

10,Vytorin,High Cholesterol,10,,"December 27, 2010",30,"Vytorin is working wonders for me.   Finding the right cholesterol lowering medicine was the key.  Lipitor gave me the leg cramps, Zocor was good, but did not lower my numbers well enough.  Same for Pravachol.  On Vytorin, my liver numbers are good.  I have not experienced any negative side effects and my numbers are excellent.",Anonymous
11,Vytorin,High Cholesterol,5,,"December 28, 2009",32,"I started on Vytorin high dose and it worked well, then it was cut in half and continued to work.  After about two years I had some bad blood work and due to the Vytorin my CK enzymes were just under 2000. I am off if it altogether. ",docgraham
12,Vytorin,High Cholesterol,2,,"December 7, 2009",51,Vytorin did a great job at lowering my total cholesterol level but the side effects are so bad. Leg cramping and muscle pain. I took myself off of it and I will never go back on it. All my aches and pains went away totally within 2 weeks! So I will ask my doctor to try something different. ,juliewest

15,Vytorin,High Cholesterol,10,,"December 6, 2008",22,My last labs were awesome.  My doctor was quite pleased.  Both my LDL and triglycerides were way down and in the low normal range.  No small feat since I have had Type 1 diabetes for 31 years.,Anonymous
