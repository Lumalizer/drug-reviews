0,Rosuvastatin,High Cholesterol,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 25, 2022",0,"I was prescribed 5 mg of Crestor 18 months ago for high cholesterol. My story is much like everyone else’s on this site. I was 68 years old when I started this medication, in good health, active, exercising regularly and at a normal body weight. Gradually, I began noticing back pain, hip and leg pain. At first I thought it was just due to the ageing process, but the pain continually increased, where I could hardly stand up from a sitting position. I was laying on a heating pad each night to try to sooth the discomfort. It was hard to lay in one position very long. I went to an orthopedist, thinking my hips must be severely arthritic. I was eating Motrin like candy. He said my hips were fine. Each time I went walking 2 miles, the pain increased, so I stopped exercising.  My neck became stiff and the range of motion turning my head was impaired. It was hard to drive looking behind me. I was having frequent dizziness. I stopped the Crestor, 7 days later, I was better.",Almondjoy33
1,Rosuvastatin,High Cholesterol,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 12, 2022",0,"I was on this medication off and on for a year.  I finally took myself off due to horrible side effects.   My Dr told me I had no choice but to go back on it so I took her advice and restarted the med.  It lasted for TWO DAYS before I realized why I went off of it the 1st time.The muscle aches/pain and fatigue were HORRIBLE.  My quality of life took a nose dive in only 48 hrs.  I have come to realize that Doctors aren't always right, and most are there to push legal poison (medication) without looking at healthy alternatives.  I have adopted a new way of eating (Mediterranean diet) and started to exercise more often. I also do intermittent fasting for 16-20 hrs.  My numbers aren't great but they're a lot better than they used to be, plus I have quality of life. I'm going to find a new Dr and continue to educate myself on healthy alternatives to some medications.   I realize some are absolutely necessary, but I will say.....be proactive with YOUR life and do your research.",Sadie2794

My cholesterol at the time of the attack was 164. But in my docs infinite wisdom, WENT TO 40mg. After the switch, one night I’m laying in bed, and CAN'T BREATHE IF I LAID flat, I was gasping for air. I’d fall asleep, within seconds, I was out of breath just laying in bed. I thought for sure I had more heart issues. But during the day I was semi fine. I put 2 and 2 together when several night I did not take my Rosuvastin. It’s one of the scared things that have ever happened to me, just trying to sleep, and every couple of seconds, I’d wake up gasping for air, almost starving for it. Mind you I’m 48.

What followed was six weeks of misery and a trip to ER which I attributed to a covid related set back. Things we’re not improving so in desperation I stopped taking rosuvastatin and felt normal within two days. So I am horrified to say the least. My symptoms were increased fatigue, stomachache, awake every night from 2am for at least 3 to 4 hours, loss of appetite, anxiety, trouble thinking, breathing problems, heart palpitations, chest tightness and burning, unsteady and hopelessness.",Nkennedy345

No muscle cramps or pain.   I have some slight shedding of my hair but at this point I can't say if it's the medication or if it's seasonal since this has happened before during the fall.  Before starting rosuvastatin, my labs were Cholesterol - 265, HDL - 101, Triglycerides - 59, and  LDL - 149.  Liver enzymes were AST - 21 and ALT - 14.On my 3 month followup labs, the results were: Cholesterol - 179, HDLK - 96, Triglycerides - 46, and LDL - 70.  Liver enzymes: AST - 33 and ALT - 31.   The ALT was +2 over the normal range and AST was only 2 point away from being abnormal.  I was told to continue on this course but I was hoping they would reduce the dosage to help the liver enzymes.  I will update this post if any significant changes.  Hope this helps someone.",Michele

So when it comes in the mail I take 10 mg with lunch and within an hour my heart is pounding in my chest and my pulse is racing up and down.  My reading that morning was pulse of 74. My new numbers keep going from 54 to 110 or higher and back. So I go into emergency room for treatment something had triggered afib.

I stopped taking it 3 weeks ago and the symptoms have not resolved.  Some studies show it could take as long as 2 to 3 months to recover if indeed I recover.

By the beginning of 2021, I was on 4 migraine meds and nothing was helping. Then my doctor took me off Crestor and started me on Zetia instead. Within a few weeks, I started falling asleep in the evenings without Trazodone. Then I noticed my headaches were less frequent and I was in a better mood throughout the day. I was able to stop taking 6 meds — my antidepressant, my sleeping med, and 4 migraine meds — because almost everything I was being treated for was a side-effect of Crestor. I had been on so many meds, and I still felt awful all the time because of Crestor. I spent thousands of dollars in therapy trying to figure out why I was so depressed.

Before seeing a doctor, I felt youthful, energetic, and symptom free. My doctor prescribed rosuvastatin.   What a mistake!  Worst of all, pain in my shoulders was so severe that I could not sleep.  I have been off the medication for 12 weeks now and the shoulder pain still exists.  I have been unable to do any shoulder exercise for 16 weeks which really makes me angry.  Last year, I was swimming 80 to 100 laps per day.  Now, I can't move my arms above my head.  While on the medication, my body became very stiff.  I walked like an 80 year old man.  I noticed my memory was failing when I had trouble recalling people's names.  Fortunately, these symptoms reversed after I discontinued the medication.  Now, only the shoulders are a problem.  There is no treatment for statin-induced muscle pain.  In other words, there is no ""safety net"" when a problem occurs.  I fired my primary care doctor.  I just want my life back!",SickandTired

This eventually resulted in severe Hip/Leg pain which greatly reduced my ability to walk. Being very obese, I did not need any decreased mobility. After a period of experimenting based on my own research, not the doctor's, I have arrived at a dosage level that prevents angina, lowers my cholesterol to a level my doctor is happy with. I am now taking 6x20 tablets p/wk. That is not a big decrease, but it seems to be enough to almost completely stop the intense pain I was suffering. I have investigated/experimented with the reduced dosage extensively, and is the ""happy medium"". For me, it is a good drug, if used at the right level. Without it completely, I know I would be experiencing heart/circulation problems. Prior to me making my own decisions about dosage level, my previous doctor told me that I would need a hip replacement.

However, blood tests from the last few years have revealed that I have a problem with high cholesterol and triglycerides.  Eight weeks ago, when my triglyceride number was a shocking 583 and LDL over 200, my doctor insisted that I needed some help to bring these numbers into a healthy range.  Reluctantly, I agreed.  I was prescribed 20mg of Crestor daily at bedtime.  It scared me to death to read reviews on Crestor and statin drugs in general and I almost didn't even give it a chance but also committed to making some changes in lifestyle.  For example, I started skipping most of the sweet, fatty foods and actually paying attention to serving sizes and TRYING to stick closer to recommended allowances.  I have also been going on brisk, half-hour walks at least 5 days a week.  Nothing tremendously difficult but something that has required consistency.  After eight weeks of using Crestor and living a little differently, I am happy to report that my Triglycerides are now down to a mere 67 and my LDL level is down to 57.  I’ve also lost 15lbs and I wasn’t overweight to begin with.  I expected the numbers to show improvement but I was shocked to see them this good!  What's more is that I have not noticed any of the negative side effects mentioned by so many.  Trust me, I was looking out for those for any excuse to stop taking it.  I will mention a positive side effect I was not expecting.  I've been burdened with IBS (irritable Bowel Syndrome) for many years.  I've just lived with it and been careful about how long I might be away from a bathroom.  Interestingly enough, since I have been on Crestor, I have been much more regular and, well, solid.  Maybe that is TMI but I have appreciated the change.  People seem to be more motivated to write a review about anything if they are displeased.
