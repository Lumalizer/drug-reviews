The area of the tear would swell up and I would start to limp.  It seems that I have some form of a connective tissue disease. The limp got really bad.  A week after I started Praluent I noticed I was no longer limping.  About the time I needed another dose the limp started up again. This pattern is still going on after three months with my thigh getting better and better.  Plus, all my numbers are great. My VA doctors have no idea what is going on. Anyone else have this happen??",Sitter
4,Praluent,High Cholesterol,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 13, 2022",0,Miracle drug for me! I am 26 and had very high cholesterol (309mg/dl total cholesterol). My cardiologist did not want me to go on statins so instead prescribed this drug. I was prescribed it in November and have been giving myself 2 monthly doses since then. I just got my blood work back and my total cholesterol was 180 and my HDLs were up and LDLs were down. I give myself the injection in my thigh and have no issues. Slight soreness at injection site but that is it.,DG95

Numbers still staying low and no bad side effects. Maybe some foot cramps, some lower back pain, but I'm 71 so aches and pains are expected. Stuffy nose for a few days after injection. Started on 75mg pen every two weeks. I'm now on 150mg injection pen every 2 weeks (300 mg monthly). My cardiologist loves this stuff and my numbers. I worry about long term kidney or liver damage.

9,Praluent,High Cholesterol,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 24, 2021",0,"61 yo male, had LDL ~200, doctors found a blocked artery but couldn't stent it. Tried numerous statins with moderate LDL improvement, but serious side effects (muscle pain, severe anxiety). Switched to Repatha, which dropped LDL to 45, but developed severe sudden BP spikes after 3 months. Switched to Praluent 75 every 2 weeks. Dropped LDL to < 75. Praluent injections didn't bother me as much as Repatha. I do have annoying side effects: 3 days after injection I retain water and my urine is like syrup for a couple days. After that clears up, I get severe lower back pain in the morning for a few days. After that clears up, I get constipated for 3 days (very uncomfortable, but not debilitating). After that clears up, its time for my next shot and the cycle begins again. Net-net, compared to statins and Repatha, Praluent side effects are tolerable given the LDL reduction.",Axel

I'd had some walking difficulty due to a torn Achilles, which grew worse until I needed a cane whenever I left the house. I was working from home due to the pandemic. Three months after starting Praluent I couldn't stand long enough to prepare a meal due to leg pain & weakness. I didn't associate it with any medication. Then after a year on Praluent I had trouble getting up off the couch & a lightbulb came on in my head. This is what happened in the past when I had taken statins - I had finally told my Dr. that I'd never take them again. I immediately stopped taking Praluent & contacted my Dr. She was concerned that my cholesterol counts would go up. Tests showed that they had gone up since I'd switched from Repatha.

After the 3rd injection I experienced a strange scary weakness in my legs, I went to the neurologist who ruled out any neurological issues. After the 4th injection I started gradually experiencing a serious rise in BP (u pto 170/110 !) and a constant feeling of auricolar pressure as though my head would be close to explode. My symptoms tend to clearly get worse after every new injection. I was seen by an ENT and by my cardiologist who could not understand the cause of my symptoms other than suspecting they are undocumented side effects of Praluent. This drug is still fairly new so pay attention, some side effects are scary and NOT LISTED in official leaflets but there is already one ongoing study about patients who developed hypertension as a consequence of it.

20,Praluent,High Cholesterol,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 13, 2021",0,My numbers were brilliant. But after several months I suddenly became very ill. I would have episodes of severe dizziness and feeling of total detachment when all I could do was sit with my head on the table and wait to get back to myself. Or get my husband to guide me to the couch and lay me down. Sometimes the episodes were milder but more frequent like up to 3 times a day. My consultant was unreachable so my gp agreed that I should discontinue the praluent although he made it clear that he didn't quite believed that the problems were effects of the injections. When the attacks disappeared shortly after I took my last injection it became obvious that the praluent was to blame. About 3 months have now gone by and I still don't feel back to myself.

I called the company and spoke with the representative, the questions went on for 30 minutes as he asked me to take photos of the pen, several serial numbers and lot numbers, and so on which I did. At that time the man said that it was not his department to replace it and the average time would be 3-5 days (but could be longer) before that department could look at my case. The man then continued reading from a script. I had it at that point knowing that he was not going to replace my medication. The man was pleasant and I know he was just reading their policy but I was done. I do not fault this man, but the company policy sucks! Any good business would have provided me with my needed medication and then conduct their investigation. My concern is if one or both of my pens had been tampered with.

Bend to tie my sneaker; spasm in my butt.  Stretch to clasp on my bra;  spasm in my midriff.  These have subsided somewhat.  I still have the same kinds of excruciating thigh/muscle cramps at night that I got on statins.  The big difference is they aren't as bad or long lasting.  I still get cramps in my feet and the calves of my legs but, again, not as bad.  My feet get sore and tired when I take my walks, which never happened 3-4 months ago.

It was miserable.  Then six weeks later had another UTI.  Only thing new was the Praluent.  I started looking into the side effects and see that was a highlighted side effect.  As I read more on this drug I see it may be causing the fatigue and pain in my lower back and pelvic area.  I told my doctor I wasn’t going to continue.  This was a last option as I have severe side effects from everything else we have tried.  I did have blood work the other day and my numbers were lower but triglycerides were still high.,PE
47,Praluent,High Cholesterol,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 29, 2020",15,"Mine is the usual story.  I got horrific muscle cramps, especially in my thighs, from taking even the smallest imaginable dose of a statin (5 mg per week).  I just had to stop taking any statin.  I tried diet alone to lower my numbers and that didn't work.  I fought trying an injectable for my cholesterol/cardiovascular issues for several years until I didn't have any options left.  Two weeks ago I gave myself my first Praluent injection.  I'm needle phobic so imagine my surprise when I never even felt the tiny needle and had to check to make sure it was actually in my skin.  Then yesterday I did my second of my two monthly injections and it was the same; over in about 5-10 seconds!  This was the big hurdle for me, so if you think you can't do an injectable, try it.  It's really no big deal.  This drug costs me $250/month with my Blue Cross insurance.  I am hoping as users go up, the price will go down.  Time will tell if my cholesterol goes down.",uniquetta

I had one injection in October of 2015. within 24 hours my joints swelled to the point where for example I could not safely grasp my steering wheel. My B/P rose by 52 points to 191/ 106. My Cardiologist made no diagnosis outside of it might not be the Praulent, but began to try every drug that was available. My new normal B/P is  161/98.

98,Praluent,High Cholesterol,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 7, 2016",53,"My dad is taking this med as no Statin drug was tolerable for his high cholesterol. As other reviewers have noted, his LDL decreased quickly from 144 to 34. However; his HDL also had a significant decrease. It is now 34. We have a concern with this medication lowering both ""good"" & ""bad"" cholesterol. I think all individuals using this med are part of a bit of a continued experimental process given the controversial recent approval by the FDA to release. Sharing info on sites such as this can be useful. Please share feedback if others have similar experiences. My dad's doc told him to return in 2 months. He didn't seem too concerned about the low HDL number.",Fathersdaughter

100,Praluent,High Cholesterol,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 20, 2016",42,"So far this drug is amazing!  I did my first injection of 75 mg on 1-6-2016.  I had a lipid panel drawn on 1-8-2106 to see what my starting base line will be.  In the 48 hours between the injection and the lipid panel, the results were nothing less than miraculous.  My total cholesterol went from 222 to 170, LDL from 152 to 96!  I can't wait to see the results at 30 days and on.The self injection was virtually painless and quick.  I didn't even have any injection site reactions like swelling or redness and I always have those side effects from almost all shots.I'm not on the Pralulent payroll, just a 68 year old man who couldn't take statin's and now have a great alternative drug.  I hope you have the same results as I have..",Badge263

My HDL only decreased minimally from 42 to 37. My most interesting side effect is that I have had a tremendous increase in libido. I'm on testosterone replacement and about 8 meds for my heart disease and had minimal to moderate sex drive for about 5 years.
