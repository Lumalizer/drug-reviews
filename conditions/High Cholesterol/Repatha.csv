0,Repatha,High Cholesterol,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 28, 2022",1,"I have to say I'm truly surprised at all the negative reviews. I took repatha twice a month for a year and a half and never had a single side effect. The statins, and we tried five or six of them, made me miserable. Some caused back pain, some caused muscle pain and others caused sexual side effects. Once on the Repatha I felt fine and my blood test results were one's my doctor said he would pin to his refrigerator, they were that good. I would have continued taking it but my health insurance got canceled.Repatha does such a good job of reversing plaque buildup that before you quit taking it I would seriously investigate other reasons for the supposed side effects. Statins are much more likely to cause side effects and everyone I've talked to that takes Repatha is not had any of the side effects people here are talking about. Personally I think it's a life saver.",JAD
1,Repatha,High Cholesterol,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 20, 2022",0,"Started Repatha in November of ‘21 because I could not tolerate statins. Too much muscle pain and spasms. I was prescribed one Repatha injection every two weeks. After the first month I started having fatigue and joint pain. Needed a cane to walk, and after 4 months can now barely walk. I need a Walker now. Constant pain in almost all joints, swollen knees, muscle spasms. Had my last injection a week ago and now understand why I’m in such agony. Hopefully, the drug will be out of my system in 3 months and also hope there is no permanent damage. Will have to use diet and exercise (if I can ever walk again) for cholesterol. Repatha is poison. My cholesterol has been reduced. Quality of life dropped with the cholesterol. Very poor trade.",In Pain
2,Repatha,High Cholesterol,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 18, 2022",0,"We thought Repatha was the answer for my husband.   He had bi pass for the Widow Maker at 38, and was intolerant to all statins. He was placed on Repatha at age 50 and we didn’t think he was having any issues with Repatha. He has gradually been losing his short term memory, becoming more confused, agitated, depressed, and anxious over the last 2 1/2 years. We continually asked if could be the injection and was assured that it was not the cause.  We noticed when he skipped doses, he got a little better. We missed 2 doses while on vacation and attributed the improvement to being away from stresses, but as soon as he got his shot, his mental status deteriorated. He is 55. He will take a holiday from the medication for 3 months. The more I read, the more I’m blaming the medication for his mental decline as it is reported in some reports to pass the blood/brain barrier and deplete the cholesterol in the brain. We will continue to monitor as he has spent more time off of it.",Cognitive

Because of Inclusion Body Myositis arm and leg weakness, no statin drugs, niacin, zetia could be taken. My doctors wanted me to take Repatha because they felt that it would be OK for me. Repatha web site did not show any side effects of ""muscle weakness"". Called a nurse at Amgen, maker of Repatha, and she said they had no reports of muscle weakness. Ordered Repatha. Pharmacy script and info sheet in the packaging from Amgen did not mention any muscle weakness issues. Started 140 mg/ml injections 30 Sep 2021 every two weeks. I did notice some weakness, however, the bloodwork just prior to the 4th injection showed excellent reduction in most cholesterol #s. With doctors approval went to 3 week injections. I had several bad falls, very weak. prior to starting Repatha, I only raised my lift chair half way. After 7th injection I was lifting to the top, after adding 4"" pad to the seat.

8,Repatha,High Cholesterol,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 10, 2022",10,"I started Repatha because I can't take any kind of statins.  I am 21 years old and hard work out 5 times a week (gym). With statins CPK in blood test was going 800+ and its limits are 175 , after first injection I was doing workout like before but after 5 days I couldn't even move much pain (CPK was normal), I had to lower the time I was going to the gym. I talked with my doctor and he told me to do 1 injection each month and not 2.  I hoped that my body will get used to it and I would be better. Well thats not possible before I had so much energy I could sleep like 4-6 hours per day now if I sleep 8+ hours and still feeling tired. I feel my legs really weak and I have pain in muscles (that will stop if I sit on a couch all day). It's awful you won't have any energy, you will have muscle pain.  Its my only choice because I can't take any statin (260 LDL) with Repatha 150, but no thanks, I have a life to live.

This drug is a miracle. My first results brought my cholesterol down from 280 to 117. As of January 2022 it sits at 91. My first ever lab results were at 405 so as far as I'm concerned this stuff is miraculous. Any muscle issues I've had have all been related to using statins.,Niles Boatwrigh
11,Repatha,High Cholesterol,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 22, 2022",4,"First let’s discuss their autoinjector.  I’ve given injections for years as a nurse and administered to myself with less pain and bruising.  I would much prefer to draw up the medicine and do it myself.  Autoinjector needs complete redesign.  It is terrible.Now for Repatha.  I’ve been on this four months every two weeks.  According to my doctors it’s the wonder drug for lowering cholesterol.  Maybe so, but it’s side effects are so bad your life isn’t so wonderful.  Seriously, the fatigue, muscle weakness, nausea, lack of appetite.  About four days after the injection the real fun hits.  Starts with chills and drenching sweats.  Fatigue.  Muscle weakness so that you can barely function.  This is not a life worth living.  I’ll deal with the high cholesterol and not being sick three weeks out of each month.  I also have ulcerative colitis and this drug is a trigger for flares.

Things didn't get better! My ear was still a mess! My ear ended up draining into my lungs which put me in the ER. I still was not any better.

I've been going to doctor after doctor getting MRI's and x-rays and scans to see what's wrong with my thigh. They say I need hip replacement however my hip doesn't hurt. I was first on privilegent and my leg was hurting so they took me off and put me on the Repatha. They said neither one of these medications would cause muscle cramps or pain. That is not true AT ALL!!!! WHEN I GO TO GET UP I CAN'T EVEN WALK. I have scheduled hip replacement but I canceled it because if they do hip replacement and my thigh is still in severe crippling pain I'm going to be very upset.

48,Repatha,High Cholesterol,10.0,,"July 12, 2021",0,A lot of these reviews are unrealistic.You will always have side effects no matter what drug is taken unless you are talented not to have any.When side effects become serious or unbearable such as with  Statin sthat can cause terrible side effects. The worst being Lipitor.I doubt Rapatha is in the same league and side effects are to be expected.I was on Statins and I can agree they are known to have severe side effects. I too could not use them. Rapatha has done me well. It managed to get the cholesterol levels to what it should be without any big side effects.If Statins work well for some then that is ok and the same is for Rapatha and all other medications.As with everything. Consult your Doctor in finding alternative options suited to your individual needs or issues.,Rainer

After about two years I started having lots of muscle pain, cramps and severe headaches. Five months ago I had a stroke. At the time I thought I was having a  migraine.

I read most of the reviews and see some patients reporting negative reviews!  I too was having some problems at first.. but then I started to use an App called   CronOMeter  which allowed me to keep track of my daily Fats, carbohydrates, and Protein I was eating on a daily basis!  I found as long as I keep my daily Fat grams intake equal to my carbohydrates and protein grams combined, I do not experience any side affects!  This is called a Low carb diet.  What I would like ALL heart patients to know is it essential that you are fully aware of Fats, carbohydrates, and Protein grams you have in your body at all times and include that in your review of using Repatha!For example on a daily basis I consume 140 grams of Fats, 80 grams of Protein and 60 grams of Carbohydrates.

I read a study that said that this was occurring in women over 65.  I stopped the Repatha.  It took a long time to get my blood pressure back down.  I've had a calcium heart scan and my score was 2!  This is amazing for someone my age -73- with such high cholesterol.  This drug did lower my ldl to around 140 from 290 but not worth the side effects!  Will be staying away from Repatha!,Polly

239,Repatha,High Cholesterol,,,"March 15, 2018",16,Repatha cut my ~200 LDL in half to ~100 with no other drugs. It also significantly lowered my TriG and raised my HDL. I'm in my 50's with treated heart disease. Stent in one of my coronary arteries. I've tried every statin and most of them twice. The statins all gave me side effects: serious brain fog and/or muscle aches. Thus Repatha is a life saver for me. I have had no side effects with Repatha--I am very pleasantly amazed. The injections are easy but its key to allow it to warm up fully to high end of room temp to allow it to thin out and inject easier. I took the other Praluent for about 5 months with similar results. It was a little faster and easier to inject with less sting. Key is to pinch your fat fold at injection site so you don't feel it. Since I'm not on a government insurance of any kind both PCSK9 companies supplemented my insurance with a copay card so I only pay $5/month.
