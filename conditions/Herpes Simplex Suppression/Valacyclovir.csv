0,Valacyclovir,Herpes Simplex Suppression,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 28, 2022",0,"I contacted HSV2 years ago & had used the brand Aurobindo Pharma for suppression without issue.  I went off of it when I was no longer sexually active.  I started back on valacyclovir on 2/22/22 1 gram a day. I take it in the evening because it can cause drowsiness. The new prescription is by Camber Pharmaceuticals.  After taking is for a few days I was awakened by strong heart palpitations.  I took my pulse with a pulse oximeter & had pretty severe tachycardia up to 126bpm.  This happened two nights in a row.  I reduced it to half a pill or 500mg and it was better.  I reported to my pharmacist, physician & the drug company. It was very difficult to hear and understand their customer service.I would not have related it except there is a report on here that there have been other post marketing reports of tachycardia when taking this drug.The drug helps but I also take 1 gram of L-Lysine a day and avoid high arginine foods especially soy. Use GoodRx for better prices.",mema

I remember going to school incredibly embarrassed because I had giant cold sores that covered part of my lip and chin. In sixth grade, I went to a dentist appointment with a cold sore and my dentist actually prescribed me valtrex to take whenever I felt that familiar burning and itching sensation on my lips. It worked like a dream. In adulthood, I started getting more frequent outbreaks. I  got a cold sore once a month that corresponded with my hormones. I started taking valtrex daily and only get about one cold sore a year now. I just got a small cold sore on the corner of my mouth so I started taking the valtrex every 12 hours. I woke up today and the thing is almost healed, just from doubling my dosage for one day. This medicine is a life saver. My quality of life is so much better after taking valtrex and I would recommend anyone who suffers from herpes to take it.",gratefulteacher

I can see I’m not the only one. If anyone reads this I’ve read about a possible therapeutic vaccine that’s actually going to hold human clinical trials in the UK soon. To push for more therapies or vaccine studies we have to reach out to government officials insisting that there be more effective treatments.

Antivirals can actually make things worse for some people, myself included. I've had HSV2 for 4 years now and just recently decided to start taking Acyclovir daily to lower the chances of transmission to my new partner. This has been the worse two weeks of my life. I've experienced constant nausea and headache's. I also have been having prodrome symptoms that will not go away. Prior to this I never even thought about my herpes. My last partner and I who is negative had unprotected sex for 2 years without me being on antivirals. We just avoided sex whenever I started experiencing prodrome symptoms which was only maybe 2-3x per years. My body really doesn't like pharmaceutical drugs and I always have the worse side effects no matter what it is.

A month and half later (fast forward to end of March) I got another breakout.  I am also using Lysine.  My question is, has anyone who has been using this drug lost their sense of taste, either  partially or fully.  I've noticed my sense of taste has been altered.  I recently got tested for COVID and it was negative.  I’m trying to figure out if my partial loss of taste is from using the Valtrex.

I was having outbreaks for years but didn’t know it was and outbreak because it was always by my anus. So I thought it was my hemorrhoids acting up. I now know I had it for years. I do take Valacyclovir and lysine as soon as I start having that tingle. By the next day I can feel it subsiding. I take another dose the next day and I’m good.

Then when I turned 30 I had an outbreak not associated with a cold at all. I got on 500mg Valtrex immediately and still I was having 1-2 outbreaks a month.So based on that I switched to acyclovir 400mg 2x a day because 500mg valtrex was already more expensive, I didn’t want to pay for the 1G.I did some digging and finally found that this actually is a documented medical experience, published in a couple journal articles.For people with high outbreak numbers 500mg valtrex is ineffective, while acyclovir, 1G valtrex, and famicyclovir are.It would certainly shorten the length of the outbreak to 3-5 days when I took the treatment dose, but did not prevent. With 400mg acyclovir 2x a day, I still get tingling and itching sometimes but it’s been two months and I haven’t had any outbreaks.",HerpDerp

I had went to the doctors and I was misdiagnosed! They told me it was a yeast infection and gave me medicine for that. Fast forward to October 2020, I had my second outbreak, not as intense as the first but still bad, went to my regular doctor this time and boom, tested positive for type 1 herpes. I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship with my boyfriend and I automatically knew I'd gotten the virus from him. I was broken, depressed and thought my life was over. But valtrex is really a life saver, after 3 days my symptoms started to disappear. Reading you guys’ messages brings me to tears. It lets me know that I'm not alone and my life isn't over.

I really just  wanted to share this hopefully helpful tip with ya'll:  I would run out of my script all the time due to various reasons and it would result in a breakout after a day or two of missing my dose. So I told my doctor that I needed to raise/double my daily dose. She did. So now I keep taking the same amount that I've always taken AND I SAVE THE REST OF THEM. THAT WAY I NEVER RUN OUT. I have  a few extra bottles full of valacyclovir. That way if anything ever happens I know that I won't have to go without. Because this medication is something most of us will be on for the rest of our lives. So why deal with running out forever if you don't have too? I hope this helps.,Blondie

The OB lasted 2, maybe 3 days, and never blistered or crusted. I can't say enough good things about Valtrex/Valacyclovir.",Staying Anonymous

140,Valacyclovir,Herpes Simplex Suppression,10.0,,"April 4, 2012",12,"I'd gotten my first cold sore in 2004 & my lip had gotten really huge. I would get maybe one cold sore each year after that and then at least 3 a year for the last 3 years. Between the months of May 2011 to Jan 2012 I gotten about 5-6 cold sores total and I'd noticed that they were all due to an onset of stress. I spoke with my doctor in Feb 2012 & she prescribed Valtrex 500mg to be taken once a day, daily but I gotten the generic Valacyclovir for insurance purposes. I don't take it daily for suppression as prescribed but I do take it immediately when my lip feels tingly and again the following day and I won't get any sore(s). I've had a few stressful situations since getting the prescription but no outbreaks. So far, so good!",jemannie27red

I did and have not had an outbreak in 13 yrs. Neither did my ex from 10 year relationship get the disease.

Just contracted HSV2 in Dec. 2011 its now Feb. 2012.. Went to hospital day after I saw all the lesions and was on famciclovir (Famvir).. Didnt really seem to do my for the lesions. I only had one week's worth of Famvir and was off antivirals until 3 weeks ago and had 3 mini outbreaks since then with 1 lesions each. Got on Valtrex haven't even had itching or tingling since. Thanks Valtrex.,Anonymous

I have taking 1 gram daily (somewhat consistent) until about about 2.5years ago. It was great, and I didn't have one single outbreak in almost 14 years, nor did my two long term ex's get the virus. Unfortunately, I developed an allergic reaction from long term use, and can no longer tolerate it without major skin rash, major itching, hypersensitivity and also had some hair thinning. I'm trying Famvir, but so far I'm back to having outbreaks. I have gone on and off the medicine 6-7 times and within weeks have had negative symptoms, which subside within days of discontinuing.

The outbreak was the worst I had experienced in the 20 years that I'd suffered.  The daily 500mg treatment worked immediately in clearing up the outbreak, and much more importantly, I've been OUTBREK FREE since then to the posting of this note, July 2011.  I'm a believer.  Now the VA has changed my prescription of Valtrex, once a day, to Acyclovir, 400mg twice a day.  I'm fervently hoping the suppressive qualities I've enjoyed with Valtrex remain...keeping my fingers crossed.",unicovato
145,Valacyclovir,Herpes Simplex Suppression,10.0,,"June 4, 2011",31,"Valtrex (valacyclovir):I took Valtrex once last week for 7 days 3 x day during the outbreak (oral) and wow caught it right in time. I actually felt tingling right before and took Valtrex and next morning there it was. Immediatly took 500mg 3 x a day.  It worked so well with almost zero side effects at least for me. I have had HSV-1 since 6/08 and now I've got this oral for life. Anyway I started 3 days ago on suppressive therapy 500mg x1 a day and I take it at bedtime- same time every night, because it does make me sleepy so night is perfect for me. Unfortunately I have 2 dental appointments coming up soon and that usually triggers an outbreak. I'm anxious to see if it works.",goodtimes39
