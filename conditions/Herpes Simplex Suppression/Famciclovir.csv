0,Famciclovir,Herpes Simplex Suppression,3,,"June 6, 2019",1,"I am in my 60's and used Ezovir (famciclovir) to suppress the cold sores that I have suffered from since I was about 3.This treatment was used in conjunction with injectable lip fillers (to prevent an outbreak) as over the years my lips have lost their pigmentation and thinned -so I look like a Muppet!I used this medication twice and felt slightly odd but thought maybe I was imagining it, but today (the third time)my pulse started racing and I felt so awful that someone had to come and collect me after treatment as I felt driving was unwise; that was 5 hrs ago and I'm much better but not 100%.I'm pretty fit and healthy with no known allergies, so I guess this medicine is not for me.",Ziggy
1,Famciclovir,Herpes Simplex Suppression,6,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 11, 2018",6,"Famvir (famciclovir):Dr ordered tests which revealed Epstein Barr, Parvovirus, and Herpes Virus (forgot the number). He put me on 500mg 3 times a day. I’ve only been on it three months so I don’t know effectiveness. I had genital herpes outbreaks fifteen years ago for about a year but none since. I started the medication and had severe headaches that went away after three weeks. No other side effects",Elaina

3,Famciclovir,Herpes Simplex Suppression,10,,"July 22, 2008",51,"Famvir (famciclovir):Famvir works the best. I have a lot less breakouts, and when one is coming on I take it and it is gone within a day. I don't have any side effects like I did with the others (headaches and breakouts). It is worth the money.",Anonymous
