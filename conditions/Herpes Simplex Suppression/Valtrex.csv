0,Valtrex,Herpes Simplex Suppression,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 25, 2021",1,"I have been suffering from cold sores since I was a young child. I remember going to school incredibly embarrassed because I had giant cold sores that covered part of my lip and chin. In sixth grade, I went to a dentist appointment with a cold sore and my dentist actually prescribed me valtrex to take whenever I felt that familiar burning and itching sensation on my lips. It worked like a dream. In adulthood, I started getting more frequent outbreaks. I  got a cold sore once a month that corresponded with my hormones. I started taking valtrex daily and only get about one cold sore a year now. I just got a small cold sore on the corner of my mouth so I started taking the valtrex every 12 hours. I woke up today and the thing is almost healed, just from doubling my dosage for one day. This medicine is a life saver. My quality of life is so much better after taking valtrex and I would recommend anyone who suffers from herpes to take it.",gratefulteacher
1,Valtrex,Herpes Simplex Suppression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 31, 2021",2,"I have been using Valtrex 1mg since the third hsv 2 outbreak, however it does not improve the healing time, despite taking on the first symptomatic day, also the outbreak comes back one week later unlike the natural healing which allows suppression for 3 to 6 months.Further, I am on valtrex for 1 mg suppression for 1 year and whenever I catch cold or flu, the out breaks keep coming in new areas different than the first outbreaks, e.g., shaft and testicals, besides it keeps coming for longer periods at multiple location.It is so annoying this expensive medicine which does not improve anything and will start taking L-lysine after finishing one year on valtrex supressive.Note: I am not immunocopromised.",Franco James

3,Valtrex,Herpes Simplex Suppression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 3, 2021",6,"Did not work, actually seemed to make it worse if that’s even possible. Also, had the worst side effects - made me incredibly tired. Acyclovir works better for me but I’m still getting multiple outbreaks a month (short lived) while on suppressive therapy. I can see I’m not the only one. If anyone reads this I’ve read about a possible therapeutic vaccine that’s actually going to hold human clinical trials in the UK soon. To push for more therapies or vaccine studies we have to reach out to government officials insisting that there be more effective treatments. Either the virus has become more virulent or the drugs have become less potent...who knows.",Anonymous

5,Valtrex,Herpes Simplex Suppression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 27, 2021",8,"I was diagnosed with HSV 2 in February with an outbreak, one single blister (I guess I got lucky with that).  I took Valtrex for 10 days and the blister went away.  I started 500 mg suppression therapy immediately following my last regular dose.  A month and half later (fast forward to end of March) I got another breakout.  I am also using Lysine.  My question is, has anyone who has been using this drug lost their sense of taste, either  partially or fully.  I've noticed my sense of taste has been altered.  I recently got tested for COVID and it was negative.  I’m trying to figure out if my partial loss of taste is from using the Valtrex.

9,Valtrex,Herpes Simplex Suppression,3.0,,"January 1, 2021",8,"Okay. I long suspected I had herpes, I’d notice single outbreaks any time I had a cold. Then when I turned 30 I had an outbreak not associated with a cold at all. I got on 500mg Valtrex immediately and still I was having 1-2 outbreaks a month.So based on that I switched to acyclovir 400mg 2x a day because 500mg valtrex was already more expensive, I didn’t want to pay for the 1G.I did some digging and finally found that this actually is a documented medical experience, published in a couple journal articles.For people with high outbreak numbers 500mg valtrex is ineffective, while acyclovir, 1G valtrex, and famicyclovir are.It would certainly shorten the length of the outbreak to 3-5 days when I took the treatment dose, but did not prevent. With 400mg acyclovir 2x a day, I still get tingling and itching sometimes but it’s been two months and I haven’t had any outbreaks.",HerpDerp

I had went to the doctors and I was misdiagnosed! They told me it was a yeast infection and gave me medicine for that. Fast forward to October 2020, I had my second outbreak, not as intense as the first but still bad, went to my regular doctor this time and boom, tested positive for type 1 herpes. I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship with my boyfriend and I automatically knew I'd gotten the virus from him. I was broken, depressed and thought my life was over. But valtrex is really a life saver, after 3 days my symptoms started to disappear. Reading you guys’ messages brings me to tears. It lets me know that I'm not alone and my life isn't over.

But of course no herpes results as they don't test for it routinely,  it's only accurate when you have an outbreak.  I got my tests and all clear. But this guy had herpes and he did not tell me. Cruel and unusual and malicious thing to do. He knowingly gave me herpes.  He knew he had it. He told me afterwards.  I have been in constant pain for months.  Valtrex seems to work.

I took it for months with nothing changing. I had outbreaks even while on the suggested daily recommendation and when I began breaking out, I’d take heavy doses hoping it would help. It didn’t. As other reviewers have said - it basically appears to be placebo pill. Unless you have insurance and can get the real valtrex - do not support Camber manufacturing.

I ran out of my script and had trouble getting it refilled about 3 weeks ago, so I decided to try just taking L-Lysine.  Nope, had the worst flare in 20 years and even had trouble sleeping because of the itching, burning pain.  I started back on it and immediately my blisters started healing.  Yay, science!
