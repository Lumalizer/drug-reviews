0,Brimonidine,Glaucoma Open Angle,1.0,,"February 11, 2022",0,"Alphagan P (brimonidine):Horrible, like all the rest I have tried. Same effects as others, intolerable burning, beet red eyes, itching, blurring, rapid heartbeat, swollen upper eyelids, pouches and discoloration below eyes, loss of hair and eyelashes,on and on. Embarrassing to appear in public. People assume I am either an old lush or smoking too much pot. Not to mention my bald spots. You need to update your responses, what occurred in 2016 may be different than 2022. I think we need to band together and fight the big pharmas. Many $ for eye drops that are toxic to your system? One prescription cost $500 for 2 month supply. I had to discard it. My skin burned like fire.  I have gone through this list of drops and not one is safe to use. S.O.S. someone help us!!!!!!",Carmen
1,Brimonidine,Glaucoma Open Angle,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 2, 2020",2,"I have been using Brimonidine Tartrate 0.15% for many years now twice a day. It has significantly decreased my intraocular pressure. The only thing it is not helping is my eye redness which is aggravated by my dry eyes. Also it is very expensive at CVS for a 90 day supply (around $600-something until I reach our insurance deductible, then I only have to pay 15% of cost).",Soaplvr4evr
