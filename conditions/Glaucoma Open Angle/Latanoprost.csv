I used it for two weeks as a trial and both went down to 14.  Have used it six months now. My eyes stay very dry and red and irritated, and feels like something is in my right eye all the time.  I've gotten super sensitive to sunlight and tv  light.  Went to dr. yesterday, now pressure is 18 and 21.  It has increased my eye pressure plus my eyes often have white globs of gunk when I wake up.  The doctor ignored any and all of my concerns with this xelpros,( latanoprost) now wants me to have laser surgery.  I'm trying to find another doctor for a second opinion.  The last three months of meds are made overseas.  I am extremely frustrated with both the doctor who explains nothing, just throws pamphlets in my lap when I ask something.  Unfortunately, due to Covid, appointments are made months in advance, and I am concerned about waiting several months to see another doctor.  She refuses to offer anything else.",very stressed
1,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 7, 2022",0,"Doctors should warn people before prescribing this. I think the side effects and incidents of side effects of this and even other drugs are under reported.  When people stop a medication due to side effects, doctors should be required to log this with the manufacturer.  My case with this drug.  Within a few days of use I started to have a runny nose.  After a few weeks this worsened such that I felt like I had a head cold all the time.  Runny nose, sore throat and cough.  Very hard to get any good sleep.  In addition, it lightened the iris color in both my eyes. At least they both were lightened equally, however, I used to have very dark brown almost black eyes and now they are medium brown.  I stopped using these drops a few days ago.  The runny nose is getting a little better but still persists.  I am hoping the cold symptoms will eventually go away but now I read that the iris color change can be permanent.",AmnelK
2,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 5, 2022",1,"This stuff is absolute poison and my built up in my body over several months, culminating in a multi-systemic reaction that has taken over a year to recover from.  I do not recommend this for anyone, especially those with with potential MTHFR genetic mutations, vitamin B metabolism issues, beta-oxidation disorders, nor for humans, period.  There is not one system that didn’t suffer.  Even a year later, I still have occasional reflux (bile & acid) issues and focal aware seizures.  I only had psoriasis and glaucoma before this drug—but my physical and mental health were nearly devastated by it.  They don’t understand the method of action of the pharmacokinetics of this drug, but I’ll tell you: it dysregulated ALL of my smooth muscle tissue.  It’s supposed to affect only by the back of the eye, but if you can’t oxidize this poison, may Heaven help you as it did me.",Redhead

To tell you the truth I think they are great. I take them as prescribed, I have noticed however that I get really drowsy and nod off.

6,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 16, 2021",5,"I have been prescribed latanoprost and received the Greenstone brand. This was to replace the Dorzolamide HCI and Timolol Maleate which caused a severe drop in O2 and wheezing. I wound up in the hospital (I have ongoing lung issues and should never have been prescribed that). The new Dr. prescribed latanoprost. At first I thought it was okay. But I developed pretty severe night sweats about the same time. I didn't put it together at first... but just looked it up, and sure enough (buried in the literature). I've also had lower O2, just not as bad as the Timolol, and sinus issues, chills, jaw pain and anxiety. PAY ATTENTION! It's hard to believe that eye drops can affect so many things, but they have a direct pathway into your body. They are DESIGNED to lower ""pressure"" so that should be a clue. It's interesting to note the differences between manufacturers. It seems that medicines are not as regulated as they should be, I wish that we made our own medicines in this country!",Stampede Queen
7,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 6, 2021",3,"I've been using lumigan and dorzolamide for 5 years with no problem, but the dr. wanted less pressure for my right eye so prescribed Rocklatan, which is half latanoprost: only one drop of Rocklatan in one eye per day and only for the past 5 days. Such a TINY amount, but it has had a huge effect! I am a healthy and active 70-year-old  -- swim every other day for 30 laps. Today I thought I had Covid (I've been vaccinated).  Yesterday and today, I had an episode of a retching dry cough until I had to sit down. Today it was kind of scary -- it was hard to catch my breath because I was coughing so hard. This was after a swim. Latanoprost increases cough sensitivity -- look it up. I rarely have anxiety -- but I've have had a dread kind of anxiety for 3 days. This morning when I woke up and tried to look at the weather report on my tablet in bed, I could not read it -- vision too blurry! I have put FOUR FREAKING DROPS IN ONE EYE-- that is all. This medication is too strong for me.",cgrantg
8,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 10, 2021",16,"I am 52 years old, great shape and on no other meds. After about 4 months being on latanoprost I realized my joints hurt, like shoulders, hips & knees (I had ACL surgery years ago). I felt so stiff and sore and couldn't figure it out. Eye Dr nurse said she never heard of that before & pharmacist said a small % showed muscle and joint pain. That has gotten a little better... but I can't tell you how fatigued I am. I have NO ENERGY TO DO ANYTHING. I could sit all day long... that's not me!! I had a hard time believing two eye drops at night would do this, until I read all these reviews. Thank you for your time, everyone. I hope mine message helps someone. I'll go back to Dr and see if another Rx is an option, just to see if I get my energy back & joints feeling better. It's a fine line between that and treating my glaucoma....(!?) My pressure went from 21/22 to 18/17, so not as low as he wanted, he may switch me for that reason.",Jod
9,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2021",3,"Well today would of been my third day using the drops but I slept all day will skip. Dose until tomorrow.  I read all the information inside out the box I did all the internet searches - googled binged, duckduckgo u name it.  I read that the medication must be kept refrigerated until I open it  that means when I buy it from my local walgreens CVS target or rite aid or the victorian pharmacist it better be cold. Please understand that I read what it meant which means I don't want to hear oh no it's ok it can be 6 weeks to months. No to me it means JUST LIKE THE VACCINE  YOU MUST KEEP IT COLD OR ELSE CHANGE THE LITERATURE",QueenZ

After reading the reviews, I have to admit I was skeptical about this medication.  However I thought, I won't know if this will work for me if I don't try.  Been on the drops for a month, and followed directions.  So far no side effects at all.  I keep my meds in the fridge, even though the package say you don't have to.  But no stinging, burning, blurred vision, dry eye, runny nose, heart palpitations, shoulder or any muscular pain, etc.  The drops are easy to use.  The only reason I rated this med a 5 is because I have not been back for my follow up yet.  I will update.",Mary
11,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 10, 2021",3,"Xalatan (latanoprost):This is better than LUMIGAN. LUMIGAN gave me flu like joint symptoms. Have stinging pain but tolerable. At least Xalatan doesn’t have flu like pains.  Though by 5:30pm each day, my eyes and eye areas are super burning. Had to use aloe Vera sunburnt creams and cucumber (it was either that or a packet of frozen peas on my face) FYI laser didn’t change my pressure turns out it only works 80 per cent of people.

I have developed straining with pooping that started shortly after, trouble swallowing that started after four months, then heartburn acid indigestion, the feeling like ulcers are described, and acid reflux—I used Maalox and when I took an antacid, my stomach burned like I had more ulcers, throat burned, saliva burned and my mouth tastes like bile.

14,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 16, 2020",17,"Used Sandoz, made by Akorn in Ft. Worth, for 3 1/2 years with great success in lowering eye pressure. Went from 22 to 25 down to 12 to 14. Humana Pharmacy switched supplier to Rising made in India. After using, for 3 months, went back to eye doctor for checkup and pressures were all the way back into the low to mid 20's. Switched to others and have now settled on Lumigan, costs dramatically higher, plus Timolol Maleate in one eye only twice a day. Glad to see another commenter on here having the same issue after Humana switching source. I have suspected all along it was the quality of source and not the actual drug. Positive it was cheaper for them. Incidentally other than eyelashes growing longer, did not have any of the other side-effects mentioned in the posts below.

First is my vision seems to be strange in not focusing right.  I had a small amount of floaters and now they are so many and much more often.  My eyes sting and are red, even was brownish in the corner one morning that scared me.  I have coughing, shortness of breath, over all tiredness and lack of motivation.  I feel anxious all the time, never felt like this before unless I was ill.  I am quitting this drug and taking my chances on high pressure instead.   I can't believe they prescribe this to small animals that can't tell you how horrible they must feel since many are only 12 pounds whereas a person is 150 or so.  They will push these drugs on anyone and anything to make a buck.",jazzie

18,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 2, 2020",85,Ended up at Optho. with high eye pressure and prescribed latanoprost. First night I had a fast heart beat.  I have been fighting a strange tiredness that I barely can do anything during the day.  No motivation for projects or general chores.  I feel anxious most times and never did before.  I have trouble catching my breath and had small trouble before but nothing like this (not a smoker).  Coughing all the time.  Why would an eye drop to lower pressure cause all these problems with general overall well being.  I am not myself and can not live in this state of unrest and sickness.   Why does it affect all these other aspects in my health?  Eyes are important but so is staying healthy and being happy.

21,Latanoprost,Glaucoma Open Angle,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 8, 2019",52,"Latanoprost gives me pain around my eyeballs, where they meet the eye sockets, above and behind the eyes.  It also has blurred my vision (impedes focus) & has increased my floaters, either physically or perceptually.  It works against my slowly detaching retina; the decrease in IOP exacerbates a forward or inward drawing of my retina, like suction.  This would explain the floaters, as coming from behind the retina edges.  The drops do lower my IOP but the cure is worse than the disease in my case.  I have stopped them for weeks at a time to deal with adverse effects, but have been persuaded to resume for fear of glaucoma blindness.  There needs to be treatment of glaucoma's root cause:  optic nerve deterioration.  I am going off this med, to allow side effects to improve; I will then either seek alternative treatment, or a second opinion, or take my chances by leaving well enough alone.",Jon

The drops dropped my pressure into normal range.  One draw back:  The drops did make my eyelashes grow longer, but they also made eyelashes  to grow in the inner corners of the eyes, dark hair on cheeks and chin,  and ""crazy eyebrow"" hairs to grow.  I also have PCOS with some facial hair.  After being on latanoprost, the facial hair got WAY worse because of the prostagladins in the formula.  If you are ""blessed"" with extra facial hair as a female, be sure to tell your doctor.

I was begging for the hospital to section me. Within a week of coming off of this drug I was fine . I am writing this review not to tell you not to take this drug as I was fine on it for several months. I am just saying watch out for the signs and have a backup plan as far as medication goes.
