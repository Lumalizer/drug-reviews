0,Xalatan,Glaucoma Open Angle,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 10, 2021",3,"This is better than LUMIGAN. LUMIGAN gave me flu like joint symptoms. Have stinging pain but tolerable. At least Xalatan doesn’t have flu like pains.  Though by 5:30pm each day, my eyes and eye areas are super burning. Had to use aloe Vera sunburnt creams and cucumber (it was either that or a packet of frozen peas on my face) FYI laser didn’t change my pressure turns out it only works 80 per cent of people. Re xalatan, I’m not sure I can tolerate this extreme sunburnt for that long",Bc
