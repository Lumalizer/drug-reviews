0,Bevacizumab,Macular Degeneration,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 16, 2020",1,"My dry age related macular degeneration went wet on December 9, 2015 and within an hour I went from 20/20 in my left eye (already legally blind in my right) to 20/200+.  The next morning my retinal specialist saw me and gave me  my first avastin injection into my left eye.  By the next evening I was able to read text on my computer (with some difficulty).  It's been four and a half years now and I've had 37 injections but I'm still able to pass my drivers license test at the DMV.  So far it's worked well for me...",HowardB1
1,Bevacizumab,Macular Degeneration,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 20, 2019",2,"I have macular degeneration and have taken bevacizumab shots for 2 years,  it hurts some but if I am able to see it is worth it. Anyway  I still try to sew as I was a quilter but my husband has to thread my machine and be my cheerful ripper I make a lot of mistakes now and it is very frustrating. Also I lost my drivers license 4 years ago, I  am 82 and get pretty frustrated.  I hope they get some new meds for this or figure out why it happens.",Buckjo
2,Bevacizumab,Macular Degeneration,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2015",5,"I have a rare retinal condition. I have had 3 injections into my left eye, 6 weeks apart. The medication helped reduce the cyst/fluid & blood build-up behind my left eye. (Nothing can be done about scarring on the retina from the cyst) So, I have a problem with my central vision because of it. My condition was caught early. I am checked at 6 week intervals. Did not need a shot last visit. Last injection made my eye hurt for 2 days. Other than that, no problems.  My retina specialist takes pictures each visit & is following me closly. Also monitoring my right eye.",Century21cyn
3,Bevacizumab,Macular Degeneration,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 10, 2012",57,"Avastin (bevacizumab):My 15 year old son has been receiving injections of Avastin, directly in his eye, for nearly 5 years now. It does not cure the macular degeneration, but it restores his vision temporarily for anywhere from 3 months to maybe 15 months. It has managed to save his vision in the affected eye, at least temporarily, and hopefully a cure will soon be found. He suffers no side effects, and has even gone straight to school afterwards (his choice).",MommaLaughing
