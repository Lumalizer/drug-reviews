0,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 29, 2021",0,"Been getting Eyelea for 1 year every 4 weeks. The last injection took my vision away immediately. I saw sparking white dots and black dots. An opaque big spot blocked my central vision they said it would go away. It never did. That was my right eye. Now, one year later it’s the same. The flashing sparks of lights and zigzags are exhausting. Now I see in my left eye the damage from my right eye. Has anyone had this happen?",Cat
1,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 6, 2021",2,"I am 74 and developed wet macular degeneration in the left eye quickly but got to a retina specialist within a week. Vision had dropped from 20/25  with glasses to 20/160. After one injection with no side effects, vision had improved to 20/60 and blood had been reduced by 80% in four weeks. The injection is essentially painless but does feel like something in your eye for a day afterwards. The results are amazing",Scott
2,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 20, 2021",1,"I was diagnosed with Macula Degeneration at the age of 48. One of the youngest my doctor has treated. To say that I was scared to death is putting it lightly. I, like most others saw the wavy lines. I had my first injection of Lucentis and eventually was able to go 2 years with no injections. We started again and the Doctor decided that it was no longer working. I switched to Eylea. My opinion is the Eyelea hurts more at injection. I have been told maybe because it is thicker than Lucentis? After many injections this year I am now having an injection every 10 weeks. Hopefully being able to go longer. My one problem with Eylea is a minute after my injections I get terrible head pain in the back, temple and around my ear. It’s like an ice cream brain freeze but much more intense!! It doesn’t last long but it’s so strange! Does anyone else have that issue?I am very thankful I this treatment has allowed me to live a normal life.",Connie
3,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,1.0,,"August 9, 2021",0,"I no longer get injections. Although I have been told that the fluid  blister has dried up the remaining scar tissue has obscured my central vision. It cannot be removed. My eye pressures are satisfactory but the distortion and poor depth perception are troubling.As was the burning down that side of my face later diagnosed as  inflammation of V2&V3 by a neurologist.I now take medication for this( Duloxetine)I will be followed by my retinologist every three months. The choice that I was given : continue treatment knowing that my vision is as good as it could get or discontinue treatment. I opted for the latter. It seemed to be a zero gain scenario.This is my experience only. There have been many successes judging from other reviews.I was just unlucky, I guess.",KatieG
4,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 3, 2021",9,"I have been diagnosed with Macular Degeneration about 7 years ago. Every 8 weeks I have Eylea injections in both of my eyes. Thanks to that I am still able to work, read and drive.",Rusty
5,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 21, 2021",21,"I complained to my consultant after the first EyleaInjection that I was suffering from visual distortions.  He said he could not explain my difficulty but insisted Eylea was doing its job. I continued to have 2  more injections as I trusted his advice.  This series of treatment ran from June to September 2020.  The distortions got worse with each injection . I am now suffering from debilitating distortions, unable to read , watch tv , sew etc.",Chillie
6,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 21, 2021",20,"Recently, I had an Eylea injection on 4th of December 2020. My vision has not improved but my ophthamologist told that the fluid has gone. The problem which I'm facing is really making me anxious and agitated. There is  emergence of floaters in my eye, although my doctor says that retina and the macula are fine but still the eye floaters are in my entire visual field ,sometimes they go away but most of the time they are there and cause curtains on the top and bottom of my eye. Vision is blurry and the eye floaters obstruct my vision and I can't see clear",Mooses
7,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 13, 2021",7,This is an update to my October 8 th 2020 entry. The vision in my affected right eye took a dramatic turn in the third week of October. It was like a large black mass in my central vision. I was seen the next day by my retinologist. The scans showed that the  blister behind my eye had burst despite treatments. As it was explained to me the remnants of the blister is like a rug being pushed up. It doesn’t go away. This happens in 5-10% of the population where treatments are ineffective. I am still getting treatments every 6 weeks and now worry about my left eye.,KatieG

9,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 27, 2020",11,I am 75 year old male and have been taking Avastin shots once a month for about a year. Avastin stabilized my eye but my vision did not improve. I have had one lot of  Eylea and one day out I can see an improvement.  Straight lines such as a door jam are much less wavy (you know what I am talking about). So I am hopeful about this new drug.,Desert Rat
10,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 8, 2020",27,"I have been undergoing treatment with Eyelea for wet  macular degeneration in my right eye for three years.However there was a nagging discomfort that seemed to coincide with more frequent treatments:eye pressure, burning and numbness down the side of my face on my affected side.I have been told by the retinologist that it has nothing to do with the treatments.I was referred to a neurologist thinking it was trigeminal neuralgia. Neurologist didn’t think I was in  enough pain to confirm that as a diagnosis. I am now getting Eyelea every 7 weeks as the fluid behind my eye has continued to be a problem. The burning and numbness has become very distressing once again. I am at the point of comtemplating discontinuing the treatments. I am being told that these injections have  saved me from going blind.Is there anyone out there that has experienced this pressure, burning and numbness as a side effect of these treatments?I am 69 years old.",KatieG
11,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 22, 2020",29,"After several treatments, the last injection in my right eye caused blindness.  I cannot see anything. I have been told by doctors this problem might clear up after 1 to 3 months.  It has been 1 week and there is no improvement.  This is kind of ironic, considering the injections were supposed to prevent blindness, not cause it.",rgphila
12,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,,,"June 15, 2020",17,"I have been getting Eylea injections for about 18  months, the right eye cleared up immediately but it took months to clear up the left eye.  They are both dry now and the doctor extended injection time to every 3 months, however, now the dry macular degeneration has gotten worse with distorted vision, can't read with the left eye. Doctor wants to increase injections to every month in the left eye but I'm afraid, read this could increase progression of the dry macular degeneration. Has this happened to anyone else.",Cat
13,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,10.0,,"May 18, 2020",17,"87 years and my first injection 2 months ago was a disaster, the injection really stung in my eye and was upsetting, however  my second one 3 weeks ago was perfect, I didn’t realise the injection had taken place. No improvement in blurred vision yet but a long way to go. I feel the  anaesthetic was left too  long before the first injection.",Billy T
14,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,10.0,,"April 17, 2020",30,"Wet AMD in right eye - age 58.One Eylea injection. Had been getting very wavey straight lines and considerable indentations on objects such as peoples' heads and faces.  Not a pleasant experience! Not because it hurts but just because of the idea of having your eyeball injected.However, the local anaesthetic worked well and whilst it wasn't fun, it wasn't painful. I noticed a large, back floater later in the evening but that was gone by morning. No real pain but there was a lot of blood in the white of my eye - looked like one of those red-eyeballed birds for about 2 weeks.There was no obvious improvement in the blurring, so I stopped thinking about it. Then one day, after about 16 days, I just thought - 'hang on, the blurring is hardly there anymore'. So, it appears to have worked well in reversing the symptoms. Of course, I'm not looking forward to the next injection but that's OK because it has worked for me and is obviously worthwhile.",Django
15,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 10, 2018",49,"I was terrified at the prospect of an eye injection. But I found it totally painless Quick. And the only downside was blurred vision for about 20 hours. I got it done in Dublin.M ore people need to write their positive experiences , I see so many awful reviews . I will never fear going for my injections ever again.",Vonnie
16,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 29, 2018",58,"I have had wet macular degeneration for 4 years.  So far I have had 14 Eylea injections in left eye, spanning once a month for the first year lessening to only one injection in the last year.  Injection pain and redness varied a lot, some injections were painful and messy others not so, I put it down to the experience of the injector.  All cleared up fine.Afflicted eye on last examination had no active signs of AMD.",Peter Pan
17,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 28, 2017",17,"Been on off the drug for 18 months, not on any regimented schedule, but as of now I am able to skip a treatment, the same a year ago.  But this time I am taking herbs and a more veggie type diet, which for the past 6 month has equated to no longer have hypertension. 116-126/70 etc verses 142-155/90. (depends on when I am checked).  Cutting meat and adding Q-10 and Phytosterol complex, some Fish/ Krill oil and garlic helps a lot.  I say helps, the aforementioned items are the variable plus stopped using Generic Areds2 and back to the more expensive Brand name Areds2. I have two insurance polices  Tricare always turns down claim due to the word injection triggers the non-Ambulatory (Dr Office walk in, not surgical center)",Deputy Dog
18,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,10.0,,"May 12, 2017",49,"I am a 69 year old female with extensive family history of vision loss from wet AMD.  I was diagnosed with bilateral dry AMD at age 55.  In March 2017 I noticed distortion and smudging in the right eye. I immediately sought treatment and was administered Eylea. I have now had 3 monthly injections.  The macular edema has subsided and the leakage has stopped.  I am now scheduled for injections at 8 week intervals. The injection procedure is painless, however once the numbing medication wears off the discomfort is intense for approx. 6 hours.  I manage the pain with ice packs, one hydrocodone tablet and a long nap.  I am cautiously optimistic that the Eylea medication will protect me from the same fate of my numerous relatives who were blind.",JJune

20,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 7, 2015",27,"I am 86 & have Wet Macular Degeneration. I had the 1st injection of eylea into my ""good"" left eye on Tuesday morning, September 8, 2015. Wednesday night, approximately 36 hours after the 1st injection I had a significant bleed in the injected left eye. I went back to the doctor the next morning who verified the bleed but insisted the eylea did not cause it and that it's lucky I just had the injection. I saw another retina specialist who said that it does happen that people get bleeds after the eylea. When I asked about eylea and infection, he said I'm worried about infection when I already got a bleed. He said I have to way up the risks before further treatment especially because my left eye is the only one with some vision left.",Hanem
21,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 29, 2015",52,"From my experience Eylea is not as easy to inject as Lucentis, but the results speak for themselves.  I was able to go four months without an injection after only two shots of Eylea.  It completely dried up both of my eyes.  Lucentis never did this for me and I was getting monthly injections for over two years.  I have varied side effects from the injection ranging from eye redness to redness, itching, burning, and feeling like something is scratching my eye.  Giving the injection slower helped some.",Kaara
22,Eylea,Macular Degeneration,10.0,,"January 24, 2013",210,"I have been in clinical trials for 4 years for Eylea and have had no side effects.  Eylea has allowed me to return to a quality of life that I had given up with sewing, painting, cooking, driving, reading and other areas pertinent to being able to live independently. Before Eylea, I had even stopped watching television! Now I feel confident again and go out and do things on my own without fear. This has definitely been a positive, life changing experience.",Mogulsmom
