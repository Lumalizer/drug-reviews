0,Itraconazole,Sporotrichosis,8,,"July 1, 2014",15,"I'm a Canadian living in Mexico.  After picking mangoes, I contracted a fungal skin infection called sporotrichosis.  Got it diagnosed about a week after the symptoms started.  I now have been taking itraconazole for just over a week.  My dose is 400 mg a day, or two capsules twice a day.  I'm happy with the results so far.  Its a little slow to work, but it is definitely working.  The skin lesions are healing and its not spreading to any more areas of the body.  I know I'm gonna have to stick it out for a while with this medicine, but it is effective.  The only thing is I've missed my period this week.  I read another comment of a woman who said she didn't get hers for three months, so I imagine I'm gonna be in the same boat.",MangoConChile
