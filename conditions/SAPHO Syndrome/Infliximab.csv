0,Infliximab,SAPHO Syndrome,7,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 24, 2019",1,Reduced the disabling effects of Sapho syndrome. Had to go to an infusion center to be monitored medically to get this which was time consuming but not too bad to undergo infusion. Developed a skin issue which got worse instead of better. After a lot of persistence....eventually got diagnosed with Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma. A non Hodgkin lymphoma. Was immediately taken off the infliximab. Am under a lot of care and am on different meds now.,Karah
