0,Pradaxa,Deep Vein ThrombosisPulmonary Embolism Prophylaxis Following Hip Replacement Surgery,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 26, 2018",17,"I was on two 110mg Pradaxa a day post hip replacement. I have suffered cramps and severe swelling from my diaphragm to my groin, the cramps very like bad period pains. I had rectal bleeding (fresh blood) of varying intensity every day I took the capsules, nose bleeds every morning. I did not know that it could cause stomach bleeding but since it felt just like the internal bleeding I had years ago on iron tablets, had I been warned I would have contacted the hospital. I guess I was lucky that it got no worse. Scary. Glad I'm off this drug now.",4 Upton
