0,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 28, 2022",0,"Might work for some but it nearly finished me.  Within 4 hours of first minimum dosage tablet, heart rate was below 40bpm, blood pressure was 80/40.  Barely conscious.  Extremely fatigue the next day.  Took 1/2 of minimum dose tablet and same response within 4 hours.  Third day took a tiny piece, maybe 1/10th of a pill and same results.  Stress echocardiogram revealed healthy heart, no blockages and normal ejection fraction.Emergency room doctor and cardiologist said to keep taking it and increase dose.  No way in he'll!  Zero out of ten for me.",Dr m
1,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 4, 2021",8,I took metaprolol for 27 years with no problems that controlled my PVCs and worked wonderfully. Inderal made it worse so different people might need different medications to control them. I had no side effects. I wouldn't hesitate to use it again. I don't use it anymore as I got a cardiac ablation that stopped my arrythmias permanently.,Lamb

All of a sudden Propafanone started giving me dizziness, got PVCs for hours on end, like felt them every other beat. Cardiologist prescribed Metoprolol 25 mg. Took it and it ruined me, BP dropped, heart rate dropped was in the ER with Hb of around 45-50 bpressure 80/40. Not good. Finally discontinued Propafanone and obviously Metoprolol. Gonna wear a heart monitor for couple of days, discussing ablation surgery. Can’t take the meds.",Hoof Hearted

4,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 25, 2021",7,"I take Metoprolol Succinate ER along with a variety of other heart meds. My cardiologist prescribed the Metoprolol at 50mg twice daily. The drug not only is extremely effective at controlling my BP,  I have also noticed almost a complete absence of PVCs. I have had PVCs for my entire life (76 yrs).As far as I can tell, I don't have any negative side effects from this Beta blocker.",Biohacker
5,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 7, 2021",5,"Was given metoprolol to use prn for premature atrial contraction (PAC) and developed bloating, indigestion and intermittent constipation. Only used it at night small dose 12.5 mg. After a few weeks woke up at 2 am with severe LLQ pain and 101 fever. Was dx with diverticulitis. Very painful and heavy duty antibiotics. Not sure if this happened because of metoprolol but will never take it again. Stopped the metoprolol it never stopped the PAC’s anyway. and started on Inderal.",JoB
6,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 7, 2021",38,"No prior history of cardiac issues or anxiety, 30 yr old female, been working through COVID as a nurse, unsure if I ever had COVID. Was recently diagnosed with stress induced pvc/pac’s, symptomatic and pretty frequent but not enough to require any immediate treatment when I went to the ER. Thought it was anxiety then it persisted every couple minutes a swift kick to my chest, losing my breath, so I gave in after almost a day of relaxation techniques.  ER doc started me on metoprolol. Awful. They helped the symptoms but I felt like rubbish. Dizzy, tired, my vitals were fine but just that 10-15 point drop in my blood pressure was giving me headaches and dizziness affecting me! My resting HR was 50’s which was concerning at first but I was asymptomatic so no issue, gave me anxiety tho and made me restless at night. Started on 50mg, was only taking 25mg by the end of it after 2 weeks and was switched to propranolol. Much better after a couple days of that med, way less symptoms.",Stressed out nurse

9,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,1.0,,"August 12, 2019",47,"Was on metoprolol for 4 weeks. I had nausea, headache,  no energy, stayed on bed for 3 days straight. It also dropped my blood pressure to 90/55 & stayed in that range. After that Dr took me off, no taper  - just cold turkey. On day 3 of no metoprolol I ended up in ER with rebound PVC's.  I was in a constant panic attack for the first 4 days of withdrawal.  It is day 7 & the panic is gone, but still have anxiety, still have bad headache & rebound PVC's. Dr said could take up to 3 weeks until normal. Never would have taken if I had known.",Trec
10,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,9.0,,"July 25, 2019",35,"I have been on metoprolol about 2 yrs now. Started at 25mg once a day and increased  now  to 75mg 2 times a day. It helps to control my heart rate and most of my palpitations ( to what I now know are PVC's). It controls them for the most part. There are days that the pvcs slip thru and my anxiety shoots up. The only 2 side effects I have are dozing off and a lot of weight gain.  I'm 41 yrs old, 5 foot 2 inches tall 228 pounds now my highest weight ever and started pre-menopause",Beba
11,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 19, 2019",13,I take 25 mg Metoprolol Succinate once in the morning it has no effect. A higher amount causes occasional visual hallucinations.,Mary
12,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 29, 2018",22,"It was 3 years ago I suddenly realized I was grieving a terrible loss...loss that grieved me very terribly.  At 57  at that time I was very healthy, exercising regularly and eating well  and taking my good health for granted,  needless to say because of the stress I was under my blood pressure was very way up which was very unusual and I was suffering from PVCs. I was prescribed  10 mg  lisinipril and 25 mg Metroprol. As I continued  to grieve, exercise and eat well,  and take the medication as prescribed my blood pressure became normal and PVC disappeared. I went off Lisinopril  a year later...I’m 61 now and I’m experiencing some different stress and PVC back with blood pressure normal.  I’m bit scared. I do have appt to see my  nurse practioner next week.",Jamie
13,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 17, 2018",50,I'm 43.  I've had PVCs on and off since I was in 9th grade.  I played basketball in college and that's when they really started to be more consistent.was prescribed Atenolol and it helped for about 6 hours. When it wore off they were bad. Dr. prescribed metoprolol succinate as it is an extended release beta blocker.This medication works very well for me.people claim beta blockers don't stop the PVC themselves rather the beta blockers simply numb the sensationFor me this is not the case.It actually stops them.I take 25mg.  If I have a bad day I take an extra half.Only side effect is during intense exercise my max HR is 155 ish instead of 170Not a huge deal as I can still push myself pretty hard.,Pvc guy
14,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 25, 2018",63,"I started experiencing PVC's in 2007 during a really bad bout of depression and panic attacks. The panic attacks were daily and this lasted about 12 weeks until my doctor put me on an antidepressant. Anyways, once I started getting them, they stuck around and I still have them now 11 years later. I take metoprolol 100 mg 3x a day along with Amlodipine 5 mg 1x a day. Sometimes I take it 2x's a day if my PVC's act up. The PVC's are really scary but this combination of medicine does help them. When I first started getting them, I had to wear a Holter monitor for 24 hours and I also had an echocardiogram of my heart. My doctor told me these things are benign. They don't feel benign though when it feels like my heart's gonna stop and I'm gonna drop dead. I gave this medicine a 7 out of 10 because while it does work, I need the combination of these 2 medications to really notice a difference. I'd just like to add that I am a 38-year-old female. I've been on this medication since I was 27.",Blue
15,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,4.0,,"May 7, 2016",43,I started metaprolol 12.5 mg for pvcs. The 25mg dropped my heart rate. I still have pvcs often. Do you think dose is too low.,60 year old
16,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,8.0,,"February 8, 2016",37,I'm a 50 something female and I've been taking Toprol XL 25mg once a day for about 10 years for PVC's. It has worked very well to control my racing heart that woke me up in the night. Occasionally I still feel the extra/skipped beats but they are no longer worrisome. For about the past year I have been experiencing some shortness of breath at rest. I am wondering if this is related to the medication. Does anyone have any ideas about this?,TexasMomof2

I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC's, and also slows down my heart rate. When I first started taking Metoprorlol Tartrate, it made me very tired, but after about 2 weeks, my body got used to it, and I was fine.",IMBARB
18,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,5.0,,"September 2, 2015",49,"I find my pvc's respond better to increasing my magnesium.  I take it at night it also helps me sleep better and has a easy laxative affect in the am.  I just converted over from the 50 mg extentabs to 25 mg twice a day,  I'm hoping that the new regimen may be a little better in controlling this soccer game I have going on in my chest. I really think that the magnesium helps the most.  If I don't have better results, I may try just the magnesium without the metoprolol and see if there is a difference.",misswb
19,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,9.0,,"October 30, 2013",59,"I have PACs and PVCs mostly related to stress and anxiety. Nothing that was overly concerning. I was medicated because the feeling of the PVCs was interfering with my quality of life. Between metprolol, antidepressants and prn ativan, I gained 40lbs in 1.5  yrs.   I got more depressed.   I was exercising too. I stopped  all meds  and no change despite amping up weights and cardio/  no sugar etc.   Nothing. I stopped the metoprolol, and I drop 16 lbs in 1 1/2 months.  It also causes depression and weight gain as a side effect.  However it  is effective in treating many other conditions. I do not condone stopping medications without consulting your physician.",ray13
20,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,4.0,,"December 13, 2011",67,"I just started the Metroprolol for premature ventricular depolarizations. I was on one 25 mg pill a day and it wasn't touching it. I recently was upgraded to two 25 mg pills a day, we will see how it goes. My symptoms include rapid heartbeat while at rest and what feels like skipped beats or double beats. Most of the time they are on the aggressive side. I'm a 32 year old male.",Anonymous
21,Metoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,9.0,,"June 3, 2010",93,"I've been taking metropolol for alomst 2 years to control heart PVC's (premature ventricular contractions) and it's worked great! I take 25mg 3 times a day. Many people have PVC's but I used to feel mine and they would scare me, like a sudden gush of blood through my heart or an extra thump. I've had no side effects with this medicine except that the afternoon pill can make me sleepy. But since I'm at work, I usually drink 1 diet coke, or 1 cup of coffee in the afternoon to offset it. Otherwise I only drink decaffeinated beverages the other parts of the day. Just that one boost of caffeine in the afternoon will offset the sleepiness of the metoprolol. I'm a 46 year old female that smokes.",JackieFL
