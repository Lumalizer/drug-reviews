0,Bisoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,9.0,,"December 12, 2020",29,"Hi, was diagnosed about 3 months ago with ectopic heart beats at above 3%. Doctor recommended starting Bisoprolol. I was very concerned as worried I might not be able to stop once started. Anyway having had to wait nearly a month with these weird ectopic beats, thought I should give it ago. After about 6 weeks noticed the beats were back to normal albeit much slower heart rate at around 50 - 60bpm resting. I only take 1.25mg once a day and it seems to have helped a lot but must stick to taking at regular times. Iâ€™m waiting for echocardiogram and just hoping heart will show up as normal Structurally! All in all I think it has been worth taking it, as mild side effects much better than dealing with panic attacks daily and ectopic beats.",Jimmy
1,Bisoprolol,Premature Ventricular Depolarizations,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 14, 2020",29,"Hi thereHad a novacor monitor for 5 days recently it recorded some irregular activity and the cardiologist advised to start me on 2.5mg Bisoprolol fumarate.After one week I now have heart rate as low as 35 when tired at night with an average of 39-42 during the day. What do I do? Should I stop taking these and suffer the wonky heart beats, feels like a no win situation.",Lee

The medication has entirely stopped the palpitations and I feel much better. Only side effect was tiredness at first, but has now gone. Would recommend this beta blocker over any other, it is very effective.",Toby66
