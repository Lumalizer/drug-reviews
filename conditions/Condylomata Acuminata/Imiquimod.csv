0,Imiquimod,Condylomata Acuminata,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 9, 2021",1,"I am a physician myself. I developed anal warts of small to large size, and I had more than 10 of them. I was in all honesty very skeptical of this medicine working for the size of my warts. I thought the warts must be surgically removed, but what is the harm of giving Imiquimod a go. This was magic.  used it only twice so far. I did not have any side effects, I really did not feel it at all. All the small ones just disappeared completely. The large ones are very small now. I am not saying that this will apply to everyone. I cannot believe how fast this worked.",Anonymous
1,Imiquimod,Condylomata Acuminata,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 13, 2020",2,"Aldara (imiquimod):Been struggling with 2 anal warts since beginning of 2020, one big and the other one small. Been using podophyllin to burn the warts, but they kept coming back. And recently I started using Aldara, and within 2 weeks of using it (8 applications) both warts disappeared. I couldn't believe it. I didn't have major side effects. Just minor itching some days, but nothing bad. The cream does work. I just hope the results will last longer and not have warts back any time soon.",Brian
2,Imiquimod,Condylomata Acuminata,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 15, 2020",0,"I had 4 treatments with TCA for genital warts with no results. So, I went to a dermatologist who prescribed imiquimod. I used it every day. By day six I was no longer in pain. By day 12, 2 small warts were gone from vagina. I lost count now but thrilled to comment that I feel less around the anus. On any day I felt rash or pain/discomfort I rubbed a little vaseline to the area and went about my day. Initially, i just wanted to cry due to no relief. I couldn't pay for Laser surgery and when I heard it would be 16 weeks. I felt so sad, but I am happy that all those warts are gone and only a couple to go.",Anxious
3,Imiquimod,Condylomata Acuminata,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 23, 2019",0,"I used daily on my genital warts as directed by my doctor. The warts were small and spread out, so as was careful during application because I was told it was strong. 1 week later, my shaft and scrotum are raw, blistered, infected, and hurt so bad that I went to the ER yesterday. I couldn't see my normal doc bc I'm out of state. Anyhow, it hurts to walk, sit in a bathtub (or anywhere for that matter). Doc prescribed ?bacticirin? (neosporin), naproxen, and an antibiotic. Worst pain I've ever felt",Jeffrey
4,Imiquimod,Condylomata Acuminata,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 12, 2019",10,"Aldara (imiquimod):Aldara works, takes time and the side effects can be heavy. Mild depression, lethargy, hypertension, brain fog and headaches but persevere with it for results.",Dan
5,Imiquimod,Condylomata Acuminata,2.0,,"February 6, 2019",1,"Zyclara (imiquimod):Used 6 days and now have over 50 spots on face, 30 on neck and chest with 11 fever blisters.  Felt feverish, achey, sick at stomach, headache and lower back pain.  I guess I’m weak, because I can’t go another day.",Anonymous
6,Imiquimod,Condylomata Acuminata,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2018",3,"i was diagnosed with Gential Warts last month and was told to apply the imiquimod 5% 3 times a week. When I applied the medicine I just laid it on with it sitting on my scrotum (unaffected area) my first week went well but I guess I never rubbed it in (because I wasn't told how to apply the damn medicine!)..I had a wart under the base of my penis and 9 small ones on top near the base..now on the 2nd week I have blisters and sores that ooze pus! Even the doctor told me she was sure that it was herpes! Now I don't know if i have herpes or not but from reviews I see here, I hope that its just a severe reaction and nothing else! My culture reading should be in soon!",genital warts
7,Imiquimod,Condylomata Acuminata,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 11, 2018",3,Aldara (imiquimod):I used aldara for 6 weeks it done nothing but spread the infection and caused severe pain I would not recommend this at all,anonymous
8,Imiquimod,Condylomata Acuminata,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2018",12,"Zyclara (imiquimod):This drug is a miracle. I had genital warts, and all the distress that goes with them. They were spreading all over my vulva, down to my anus. Doctor prescribed Zyclara, told me to apply to general area every night. Reading some of the reviews on here freaked me out but I did it anyway. Nothing happened for 3 days. Was despairing, bracing myself for months, years. 4th day it started getting sore. New red spots, blisters, stinging when urinating. Applied it anyway. Next day, more soreness, though nothing so dreadful as some people report. Still no change Decided to give soreness chance to heal, didn’t apply the next 2 nights. When I went to apply it the next night I discovered that the warts had drastically shrunk. I applied it that night, took the next night off. A week and a half after starting, the warts are all gone except for a couple of tiny little bumps. I am SO thrilled and surprised at how fast it worked.",Anonymous
9,Imiquimod,Condylomata Acuminata,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 22, 2017",5,Aldara (imiquimod):I'm a gay male and had developed a killer case of internal and external anal warts about 6 or 7 years ago.  I thought I would never again have anal sex because my butt was just so nasty. I went to the derm and she gave me Aldara to try.  It didn't really do much.  I ended up finding a wonderful proctologist who performed laser surgery on my behind.  My butt is completely like new! ,Anonymous
10,Imiquimod,Condylomata Acuminata,1.0,,"November 19, 2016",1,"There is not a visible or doctor confirmed improvement in my plantar wart.  I have been applying to my foot for one week.  Curiously, I am now being treated for bronchitis that appeared after a week of usage.  The side effects table indicated a 15% chance of upper respiratory infection and a 7% chance if sinusitis.  The correlation is unconfirmed.  I live in an area of drought with wildfires creating smoke.  The respiratory problems I have are most likely related to that.",Pepperell Dragon 28
11,Imiquimod,Condylomata Acuminata,10.0,,"April 6, 2015",11,This really started to work for me around 8-10 weeks into 3x week treatment. And once it started to work they just started to fall off. By just putting small amount of ointment on the warts I was able to skip all the bad side effects. Put the ointment on before you go to bed and wash off in the morning. You will be highly satisfied with the results. Don't give up. If area gets irritated apply destin - for baby diaper rash - in the morning after you wash off.,Anonymous
12,Imiquimod,Condylomata Acuminata,10.0,,"March 17, 2015",13,"I had numerous cryotherapy treatments and used Condyline paint which both worked but the warts always came back. My doc prescribed Imiquimod as a last resort and it worked marvellously. The warts had almost completely disappeared after two weeks and I had none of the pain, burning or itching I had with condyline. After that the doc said twice weekly would be enough and after six weeks I was completely clear.",Anonymous
13,Imiquimod,Condylomata Acuminata,10.0,,"November 26, 2011",40,"Aldara (imiquimod):This works well. It takes time, but if you follow the instructions precisely the warts get smaller and smaller until they're gone. No scar, no freezing or drying, no acid. The warts just shrink until they're gone.  Less side effects than Condylox. It does not affect healthy skin like Condylox does.",Anonymous
