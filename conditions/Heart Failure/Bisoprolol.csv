0,Bisoprolol,Heart Failure,4,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 1, 2022",1,"At first, I was thrilled with the pills: they calmed the pulse, reduced fatigue, and I felt great. However, after two years of use, I realized that I was gaining weight, that I did not have the will to train, that I was actually getting tired very quickly without my heart rate exceeding 60 beats. I gradually stopped taking the pills and only then realized how sleepy and slow I was. I do not recommend this medicine to anyone, there may be better ones.",carpathia
