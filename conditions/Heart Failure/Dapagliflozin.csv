0,Dapagliflozin,Heart Failure,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 16, 2021",0,"I have been taking it for 2 months because I got worse after a heart attack, but I have pain in the left arm, this pain lasts 2 minutes it is intense then disappears it always comes at the end of the day , but does anyone feel this ?  I went to the doctor and told me that it could be a reaction to the medicine but that I should try to continue because the medicine would be good for me.  Please does anyone else have this symptom? Thanks .",Hope

2,Dapagliflozin,Heart Failure,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 20, 2021",18,"Farxiga (dapagliflozin):In October 2020 an ICD wire had failed as my heart failure advanced. I felt terrible - to say the least. Every meal was miserable for me as the shortness of breath became intolerable. I thought the end was around the corner. Long story short, FARXIGA was and is the last thing they could do for me short of a LV PUMP. FARXIGA was a little rough around the edges for a couple weeks, these days, I'm doing very well. Perhaps, I'll take it easy a couple days a week, other than that, I take care of myself and every chore and travel. Ask your cardiologist to give you chance with it.....Incidentally, I was not a candidate for Entresto (angio edema caused by lisinopril, I was happy with lisinopril for 5yrs)",Steve
