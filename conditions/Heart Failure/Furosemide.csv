0,Furosemide,Heart Failure,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 5, 2021",2,"Taking 3mos. I took a stool softener after 1 st month when had no change & then peed every 3 mins for a few days, was uncomfortable but had swollen so much couldn't bend & skin was tearing from inside out, so was worth it. Most of the hair on my body had fallen out, & lost 30lbs in 3wks. Spent 30 days swollen because 1st hosp said allergy then Dr said glands. Went to diff hosp & found had congestive heart & liver failure. Was severely swollen then. This med actually brought me back to my real weight of 120lbs from 149lbs. The stool softener was critical tho & it sucked for the 1st few weeks having to stop if in car every 15 minutes, but now at normal weight tho still taking & if miss a day will swell some",Lzargia

I will see how it goes for a while longer before I get my doctor to change it there are other pills you can get instead of lasix does not agree with you. Keep safe and well.,Inpain

4,Furosemide,Heart Failure,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 3, 2018",21,"I'm only 32 years old and I have been diagnosed with severe CHF, they prescribed me furosemide 40 mg twice a day and spirrolactonone in the morning. Yet the furosemide only becomes effective when I must check in with ER to have fluid removed. I'm still coughing constantly, out of breath and nauseous. It's terrible till I get to hospital.  They'll get average of 7 liters of fluid and I'll skip out of there singing like I never had a heart problem to begin with.",Jay
5,Furosemide,Heart Failure,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2018",19,"I was in the ER for hypertension, and water in my lungs, 6 months ago they prescribed me Lasix, for my kidney, immediately after that, I had severe edema that lasted 2 months and ended up  in the ER again with excruciating pain, there was nothing they can do. My Nephrologist took me off , but this time In the ER they gave me Lasix again through the IV, and sent me home with pills, the very next day , both my legs swelled up and again in excrucitiang pain, I don't think this medicine is helping me with swelling , it is making it worse.. It is going quite the opposite of whats supposed to do.",Ann
