0,Lisinopril,Heart Failure,1.0,,"December 15, 2020",3,I heard my heart beating so loud that I couldn't sleep. After I climbed the steps I felt an extreme pain in my heart. It was so weird. I took the 20mg of lisinopril. It gave me a way worst condition than the high blood pressure. That medication is extremely dangerous.,Z.Y.
1,Lisinopril,Heart Failure,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 25, 2016",12,It is the only molecule which does not raise createnine. For CKD patients it is the best and only choice,Ratneshwar Banerjee
2,Lisinopril,Heart Failure,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 11, 2016",16,"Have been on a combination of Lisinopril 5mg and Acebutolol 200mg daily for 21 years, due to valve leakage.  BP and rate without meds is 112/72 (78), with this combination 94/54 and (56) is ""normal"" for me.  Resting can go as low as 86/46 (48) without issue.  Works VERY well to reduce BP and consequently leakage.  I do have some issues with stomach acid, mild ED, Raynaud's, and occasional light headedness on standing; BUT cannot confirm that most of those are solely related to Lisinopril, and can be counteracted with other meds.  Did ""bottom out"" once when also taking Cialis, Temazepam, Cannabis and cracked a couple ribs in the process.  Just be careful how fast you stand up, and avoid getting dehydrated.",Clinically Complex
