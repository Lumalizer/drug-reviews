0,Carvedilol,Heart Failure,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 16, 2022",0,"I am pleased, overall, with the performance of Carvedilol for my heart diagnoses (irregular heartbeat, left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, angina, and high blood pressure).  I had a terrible experience, previously, with taking an ACE Inhibitor.  So, after getting a thorough work-up at a top-level cardiology clinic (we live close to one of the top 3 in the country), I was put on Carvedilol (along w/ a Calcium Channel Blocker).   I had low energy as a side effect, at first, so my Dr. reduced the amount to half the original dose.  I have gotten used to having somewhat lower energy and accept that even without Carvedilol, at age 66, I'd be having lower energy anyway.  I nap a bit more & that's OK.  The fact that it is such a good fit for my diagnoses, is effective for me,  and is free of serious side effects makes it a very good choice for me instead of ACE Inhibitors or ARBs.",Martij

2,Carvedilol,Heart Failure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 8, 2022",1,"I started this medicine last year and things just gradually got worse. I have congestive heart failure with left ventricular dysfunction and mitral valve issues. I was first prescribed this drug at 6.25 mg then switch to 12.5 mg and then 25. Twice a day. At 25 mg twice a day I could not even get out of bed. I was switched back to 12.5 mg twice a day. The last 6 months things have gradually gotten worse I have had severe body wide extreme pain. My hands my wrist, knees ankles toes and my back. I have been able to unable to sleep in any position. Within the last few months the congestion became worse. I also started getting rashes on my face and back. When I was sitting for a half an hour or more I could barely get up. I stopped this medicine today. I know that is dangerous. But I can no longer tolerate the pain and since it's the weekend I can't get a hold of my cardiologist. I found an alternative doctor who treats heart failure with alternative natural remedies.",sandrad
3,Carvedilol,Heart Failure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 31, 2021",1,"I had a dermatological procedure on my face called blue light for some precancerous spots. It left me with neurological damage to my nerves basically fried them so my face was red like an apple. I was put on 10 pills 60 mg. To heal the nerves. Was on it for a year and 1/2. I’m an exercise freak, eat organically and was extremely healthy. This drug played havoc with my body. I developed bad lower abdominal cramping and backache along with upper abdominal irradiation.  My urinary track was hurting me with little flow and urge to go. Each one came on separately. It continued for about 3 months. I assumed it was the drug because I’ve never had issues. I didn’t want to stop meds because my face was being cured. There are no other ways to cure this. Finally I weaned myself off the drug which basically took 3 1/2 weeks. I’ve had every test available to figure out what is wrong from MRI, ultra sounds, blood, biopsies of everything nothing found. Now I need a colonoscopy . Still in pain",Susan
4,Carvedilol,Heart Failure,1.0,,"June 15, 2021",9,"I was diagnosed with CHF and EF less than 35% in March 2021.. 3.25mg of Carvedilol twice a day doubling dosage every two weeks until 25mg 2x a day was reached. Immediately starting this medication I felt like my heart was getting worse. I had read the side effects and I waited for my side effects to calm down. They didn't they got worse with good day tucked in here and there. The pain in my upper legs was unbearable and constant chest pains, the feeling of disconnect with my surroundings, constant fighting off dizzy spells and weakness. I went from doing handyman work up a ladder all day in January to barely able to get out of bed by the end of May. My blood glucose levels went completely nuts. Beware of this med I felt trapped and I was told I had to take it to help my heart but then felt as if it was really bad for me making me worse than I was. It made me completely nonfunctional in a matter of months. I felt so much better in a matter of hours after discontinuing its use.",Reevesworx
5,Carvedilol,Heart Failure,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 11, 2021",70,"Since taking carvedilol I have gained about 40 lbs.,without any change to my diet. My cardiologist says no, that doesn’t happen. However, I have seen this same complaint from thousands of online comments. What is a good alternative to Carvedilol that does not add excessive weight? Doctors, if you’re not taking the drug, do not make ridiculous comments about side effects. Your drug company rep isn’t going to tell you the truth on side effects.",TMon
6,Carvedilol,Heart Failure,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 10, 2020",16,"Carvedilol has saved my life. I can't see any issues with this drug. Before taking it, my EF was between 14-19, now after years of taking it my EF ranges between 29-40. In 2004 the docs told me without a transplant for my Cardiomyopathy I had maybe 5 years left. Guess what, 2021 is coming up and I will be celebrating it with my 2 teen daughters thanks to carvedilol. My one and only side effect is some light headedness and that is expected from a beta blocker, cause it will lower your blood pressure some.",Baldwin Bill
7,Carvedilol,Heart Failure,1.0,,"May 28, 2020",54,"I had a leg injury.  Doctors would not give me a real pain pill.  They only gave me over-the-counter naproxen sodium Aleve which does not control pain at all and caused stomach ache and mild heart failure.  After some weeks of rest,  my heart was perfectly good,  back to normal.  The problems did not start,  until the doctor put me on Carvedilol Coreg which is a Beta Blocker,  it blocks some brain chemicals and hormones,  such as Adrenaline,  and causes the heart to pump slower.  After that,  I went into a steady decline.  Worse every month.  My heart now feels that it struggles to pump,  and blood pressure feels too low.  Leg muscles are now too weak to do leg lifts.  I feel less youthful,  feel suddenly older, and my heart muscle struggles to pump strong enough.  Heart is over exerting. I have sleep apnea and sometimes it is easier to sleep sitting up.  Carvedilol Coreg makes my heart too weak to sleep in a sitting position,  I need to be laying flat,  for heart to pump comfortably.",Age 30
8,Carvedilol,Heart Failure,7.0,,"August 18, 2019",15,"2 weeks into taking Coreg CR 10 mg I noticed blurring vision, felt like I was walking with a lean to the right side and dizzy kinda like after 4 beers chugged in 10 minutes and would break out in cold sweats with chest tightness. I quit for 1 day and called nurse telling her the above. She agreed no more CR at 10 mg so I switched to the 3.125 mg morning and evening dosage. Wow what a difference in how you feel and act.  The reason I am on this drug is I had my lungs fill up with fluid and they have no idea the reason as to why as I was in bed and merely rolled over oxygen level tumbled down into the 60's and I had very bad wheezing and felt as if I were drowning and I know that sensation all too well. But without any form of insurance I could not have all the test most people get but I did have a nuclear stress which showed no blockages and the echo showed a EF of 34%  so the diagnosis was CHF .",9 Lives

In April my heart EF was 15% the doctor put me on Carvedilol 3.125mg twice a day for one month then doubled the dose, I suffered a lot from dizziness, shortness breath almost pass out. The doctor said that’s all for my benefit. I continued  my work out, I improved a lot I am able now to do 2 miles in 25 minutes. In July 2019.

10,Carvedilol,Heart Failure,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 1, 2019",46,"I was taking metoprolol for a couple of years for heart failure and high blood pressure with absolutely no problems. Then my cardiologist left the clinic and the new guy switched me to Carvedilol 25 mg twice a day.  Immediately I suffered shortness of breath, profound weakness,  and dizziness to the point where I almost passed out a few times. Demanded to be taken off it and put back on the metoprolol. This was just my experience with Carvedilol and yours may be different. But doctors who think nothing of playing with a patient’s medications for no good reason make me sick.",Jelly Bean

12,Carvedilol,Heart Failure,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 2, 2018",52,"Coreg (carvedilol):Coreg (Carvedilol) saved my life for 2.9 years then one day my defibrillator activated & sent me into a blackout in my bathtub.  After a device check reading of 325 beats per min., a heart cath & no other findings at the hospital, the Coreg got the blame; they changed me to Metroprol; wrong.  Coreg kept me active, happy & gave me my life back.  Sure there are side effects but they don't last long; I could function daily.  With Metroprol, gained weigh, stayed very fatigued & developed vertigo.   Finally, I had a move & got another cardiologist.  I told him my wish was to go back to Coreg & explained why I was taken off this med; now, I'm back on Coreg.  I know beta blockers are not all kosher but NEVER EVER go off meds w/o your doctor's knowledge.  Also, lost my hubby to basilar artery stroke 10 days before his 30 year retirement due to his belief in no meds.  Don't do it! It may your life you save.  Always talk with the doctor & you always have the right to a 2nd doctor's advise.",Angel36608
13,Carvedilol,Heart Failure,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 16, 2018",21,"Coreg was slowly killing me and I didn't know it.  I kept passing out, broke my nose, broke my back along with other injuries from just dropping.  My last horrible experience was Ischemic Colitis from very low blood pressure.  I was in the hospital for six days and cardiology realized my very low dose of this was dropping my BP dangerously low along with my EF dropping 15%.  They switched the Coreg to Metropolol.  I am no longer coughing uncontrollably, wheezing, coughing up a lot of white mucous!  This was all due to Coreg!  Never again!",Dee
14,Carvedilol,Heart Failure,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 14, 2018",18,"Started taking carvedilol the first week of May. My EF is at 33%. In the first week I already felt a difference. Prior symptoms were chest pressure, shortness if breathe, extreme fatigue. I would say these symptoms are 80% gone now.  I feel it's time to start my cardio workouts again! In two months I will have another echocariogram. Hopefully I see some improvements. Also I would like to add that in some reviews I read of people combining CoQ10 with this medicine and I am now taking it as well. I feel more energized and I feel it makes side effect of carvedilol dissipate with it.",Belle
15,Carvedilol,Heart Failure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 3, 2018",20,"I have had always had low BP and am very active.  After Mitral Valve surgery, my  ejection fraction (EF) was 29.  I could still play tennis and lift weights even though the doctor was not sure how.  He put me on Coreg to strengthen my EF, but it has no effect because lowering low BP and whatever else it supposed to do does not work.  If I had high BP, maybe it would help, but it has only gone sideways or slightly down since I have been on Coreg for 6 months.  I still play tennis, etc.  The medicine should not be prescribed for people with Low BP in my opinion, but was told it is what is indicated for  low EF.",Rburks

I was put on Coreg for 6 months, and I experienced periods of dizziness and muscle pain.  I worked out and played tennis 3 times a week--surprising my doctor.  I had no problems, but my EF never improved above 30-35 range.  Since Coregs main purpose seems to be to lower blood pressure, I am not sure why they insisted I go on it for low EF.  I started taking CoQ10 and no Coreq  and now my EF has improved to 40 and I felt better and no dizziness.  I don't believe that Coreg actually helps with EF.  I think the studies were flawed to prove something that is not true.",RBrks

21,Carvedilol,Heart Failure,7.0,,"July 8, 2016",25,"Symptoms using Generic:  Sudden severe weakness nearly always occurring mid morning, blood pressure plummets and one time it went so low my defibrillator had to zap me.  There is a difference between Coreg brand drug and generic carvedilol.  I have been in the ER many times in the past because of it and they found nothing each time.  Thanks to O-care coreg costs $110 out of pocket now and I cannot take the generic for very long without the side effect I stated.Cure:    Short term:  drink some V8.  The potassium in it will help reregulate your heart quickly     Long term: Pay for Coreg BRAND prescription.
