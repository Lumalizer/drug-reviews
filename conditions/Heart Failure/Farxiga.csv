1,Farxiga,Heart Failure,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 20, 2021",18,"In October 2020 an ICD wire had failed as my heart failure advanced. I felt terrible - to say the least. Every meal was miserable for me as the shortness of breath became intolerable. I thought the end was around the corner. Long story short, FARXIGA was and is the last thing they could do for me short of a LV PUMP. FARXIGA was a little rough around the edges for a couple weeks, these days, I'm doing very well. Perhaps, I'll take it easy a couple days a week, other than that, I take care of myself and every chore and travel. Ask your cardiologist to give you chance with it.....Incidentally, I was not a candidate for Entresto (angio edema caused by lisinopril, I was happy with lisinopril for 5yrs)",Steve
