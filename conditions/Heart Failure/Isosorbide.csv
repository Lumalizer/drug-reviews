5,Isosorbide,Heart Failure,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 19, 2018",17,"I recently had 2 stents placed in my heart. I was put on 60mg ER Indur. I have been on it for 30 days. The headaches are horrendous, body aches, back pain, dizziness, extreme exhaustion, mental confusion. I feel like my brain is in a constant state of confusion. The headaches are still bad 30 days later. When I stopped taking the medication all the symptoms eventually left including my chest pains. I might have had better results if they had started me on a lower dose. I do not want to take this medication anymore.",Lottie

7,Isosorbide,Heart Failure,9,,"January 24, 2015",53,"I was exhausted and constantly gasping for breath.  My cardiologist put me on isosorbide mononitrate, one pill a day.  The difference was astounding.  I no longer was gasping for breath and no longer had to take naps.  The pill would wear off during the night so the doctor recently changed me to two/day.  Am experiencing some pretty severe headaches and dizziness when get up to fast.  Doctor had told me I would experience headaches but they would go away eventually.",savemyheart
