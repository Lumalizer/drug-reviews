0,Isosorbide dinitrate,Heart Failure,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 18, 2019",6,"I was put on Isosorbide Dinitrate after taking another med that cause my heart rate to go so low, which caused me to have a mild heart attack and be hospitalized.  Upon leaving the hospital, I was given a prescription for the Isosorbide Dinitrate 20mg 3x a day.  I started having angina pains so bad that I was hospitalized because of them.  I had never had angina in my life until taking this med.  I started cutting the dose slowly and noticed the less I took, the LESS I had angina pains.  Now off of the isosorbide and no more angina.  I took this med for over a year and endured this horrible pain before I figured it out.",Its Me
