0,Metoprolol,Heart Failure,,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 15, 2021",1,"I was diagnosed with heart failure and was prescribed metoprolol more than 16 years ago! I also was briefly on Coreg (carvedilol), a more effective heart medication, in my opinion, but I couldn't take the side effects, including the racing heart and the nervousness.  Let's face it, most medications cause side effects, some more serious than others, because of this asked my cardiologist to allow me to take all of my heart meds at night, which made a huge difference in my being anxious, dizzy, and lightheaded during day.",Life Is Sweet

3,Metoprolol,Heart Failure,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 28, 2020",14,"So I've been on metoprolol for over a year. Not knowing until very recently that this medicine has been giving me horrible side effects the entire time. Within the last 6 months those side effects worsened to the point of dropping my BP so low that I felt dumb or slow, confused, couldn't think straight, almost in a dream like daze. Problems sleeping, anxiety went through the roof, panic attacks multiple times a day, pain in my chest, pain in my arm, short of breath laying down, just all the way around feeling OFF. Would give this medicine 0/10 also I only take 25mg and this medicine seems to very dramatically affect me when I mess with the dosing. Also it has been dropping my BP to 80/60 an when that happens is when all of the symptoms get exaggerated",The 29yr old
