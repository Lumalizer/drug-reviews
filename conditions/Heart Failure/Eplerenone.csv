Unfortunately Inspra had the same effect.It would help if these drugs were available in combined forms, starting at very low doses in order to minimize non-compliance amongst patients who experience troubling side effects.Inspra did not have any noticeable symptomatic benefits but the low BP was very unacceptable.",kEITH-C
