0,Spironolactone,Heart Failure,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 30, 2021",0,"Was taking spironolactone for a few months alongside many other heart medications to help aid water retention unfortunately after a few months I noticed my breasts were enlarging and becoming very sore (gynecomastia) being male I was quite worried about this as they were getting rather big, having spoke to my community heart nurse I was taken off spironolactone and put on eplerenone hopefully this will stop any further growth. If you notice this tell your Gp Immediately, these are obviously not for me.",Stumandoo
1,Spironolactone,Heart Failure,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 4, 2021",2,This is a bad drug. Caused me to have muscle pain and severe cramping. I had to stay in bed for three days. My kidney function dropped to 30. Canâ€™t believe they would put this stuff on the shelf.,Anonymous
2,Spironolactone,Heart Failure,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 31, 2021",2,"For me Spironolactone was a miracle pill.  I was on Lasix, Losartan and Metoprolol for heart failure, and I significantly improved, but my ejection rate was only between 35 and 40.  My cardiologist wanted to insert an ICD, but I was not convinced.  I went to UCLA and the doctor put me on Spironolactone instead of Lasix, and a few months down the road, my ejection rate was 55 and my heart looked completely normal.  Yes, like other people, Spironolactone gives me bad leg cramps at night, but if it saved my life, I can put up with it.",Claudette

7,Spironolactone,Heart Failure,8.0,,"September 21, 2010",62,Having Heart Failure(E/F 20%) and edema and no longer able to take lisinopril my doctor put me on this. My edema has improved dramatically and it is proven to help extend the life of patients with CHF. The bad part is this medicine has horrible side effects for men and I have exhibited some. I believe it will help extend my life (I am 53) so I continue to take it.,Anonymous
