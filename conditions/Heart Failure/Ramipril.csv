0,Ramipril,Heart Failure,5,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 6, 2020",23,"Was taking ramipril in conjunction with Carvedilol for Congestive Heart Failure.  It *does* lower blood pressure.  For that, it works.  But I was waking up several times a night with foamy phlegm.  Worse, I had tonsil stones every single day (and previously had them only half a dozen times in 50 years).  The most concerning, though, was that I wanted to ditch my husband and just disappear from everyone; thoughts that were completely foreign to me. Forgot my prescription med when I went on a week-long trip and guess what?  The cough is near gone, I'm sleeping through the night, no more tonsil stones, and I love my family again.  You have to choose what's worse.  For me, my BP was only in the 130s/90s.  The side effects aren't worth it.  Cut out most salt instead and losing weight.  If your BP is dangerously high, the Rx does lower it.  The side effects are miserable, though.",Broken
1,Ramipril,Heart Failure,1,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 21, 2019",22,"Altace (ramipril):I took this for over 20 yrs then all of a sudden it became toxic to me. It almost killed me. Fell over one day, was air lifted to a major hospital, and was on life support for 4 days.",Cssn
2,Ramipril,Heart Failure,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 27, 2015",40,I found this medicine remapril caused me excessive itching so much that I ended up with sores on my backside. I also found I was unable to leave my home because of the frequent accidents I was having. Diahorria. I stopped taking the tablet and all is well again. I was surprised by my Doctors reaction when I asked for an alternative tablet. He told me it was alright to stop and didn't offer any alternative. This is puzzling after having read why the tablet was prescribed in the first place,tirade03
