0,Amlodipine,Heart Failure,3,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 20, 2021",7,"I have been taking this drug for a year at least, high blood pressure although I am taking several other drugs due to heart failure (taking Warfarin) and arrhythmia problem. I also have asthma I have not had my blood pressure checked from the time I was given Amlodopine. Doctors are not doctors any more I’m afraid, we are just statistics... and at the age of 78 I feel I am expendable...I have all the symptoms others have mentioned for a long time can’t walk straight dizzy all the time. My ears are blocked and ringing, I am breathless for the most - meaning I can't do tasks. I am  completely lethargic , I can sleep any time, I do not want to get up from my bed.  My legs gone hard, swollen ankles, dry skin, tongue hurts all the time. I want to stop taking all these meds but can’t stop all of them but had wondered if I could stop the Amlodopine at least.. makes me feel is it worth being here living this way.",Jenpen
