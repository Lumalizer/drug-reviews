1,Digoxin,Heart Failure,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 5, 2013",48,"I have been on digoxin for 25 years for congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation, still going strong with no negative side effects.",gambrel
2,Digoxin,Heart Failure,9,,"March 15, 2008",89,"It has improved my husband's life. His heart doesn't beat so weak or irregularly. Doctor says it is essential to his remaining heart muscle to beat strong & regular. Has lessened some of the chest discomfort. Only side effect noticed (at initial dose,) was the effect it had on his appetite. Initial dose was w/a.m. meds; but, went all day without eating a thing. I suggested taking w/p.m. dose. Cardiologist approved; works great. Now eats his 3 regulars daily and looks a lot better.",mpmizell
