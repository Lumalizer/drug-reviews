3,Keytruda,Melanoma,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 25, 2021",1,"I had stage IV  Melanoma went on Keytruda  for over two years as it kept shrinking. It worked really well compared to the drugs that I have had since. I had no bad side effects, and I would say it was a great drug and wish I could go back on it! I had to go for treatment every three weeks, it was for only 30 minutes. Great drug.  No itching nor rash as well.",Edna
4,Keytruda,Melanoma,1,,"August 5, 2021",2,"My husband had successful surgery to remove melanoma from his back together with three lymph nodes in December 2019.  His oncologist recommended he do Keytruda immumotherapy as a precaution to ensure no additional cells were hiding in his body.  He was not in favor of this but both his oncologist and myself encouraged him to proceed with the immunotherapy.  After two or three treatments he started having reactions to the drug and was put on steroids to counteract the reaction.  After seven treatments the immunotherapy was discontinued and health continued a downward spiral with numerous other reactions and in an out of the hospital due to the reactions.  On September 25th, 2020 my husband passed away from pembrolizumab toxicity.  We had received two sheets of paper advising of adverse reactions to this drug but nowhere did it warn against death, had it disclosed that it could cause death I certainly would not have recommended that my husband be injected with this deadly drug.",Red
5,Keytruda,Melanoma,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 13, 2021",23,"My father got his first dose of Keytruda 3 weeks ago and he has been in ICU ever since. It started with a mole!!  He was fine otherwise. Now he can not breathe, it’s damaged his lungs and ALL of his muscles! At this moment he has a feeding tube and they just gave him a tracheotomy to help his lungs. He can’t talk or even hold his head up! This is just awful! Plz don’t use this drug! I would rate it a zero",A Adams
6,Keytruda,Melanoma,1,,"January 28, 2021",0,Keytruda spends enough money on advertising that could reduce the price to a level that you could afford it.,Buzzy
7,Keytruda,Melanoma,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 30, 2020",7,"I started keytruda Feb 2020 for stage 3 aggressive melanoma. Almost immediately my moods were awful. Swinging like a kid hitting puberty. The doc said it wasn't a side effect. This continued. The fatigue increased. I felt miserable. By late August I couldn't get off the couch without moaning in pain and couldn't even get into bed. No appetite. Nausea. No energy. I knew I was dehydrated. Declined my next treatment and got fluids. Went to next appointment to tell Doc I was quitting. Finally they did labs. My cortisol was > .1 Another lab test result had ridiculously low levels as well. I should've been in the hospital. Now I'm on steroids, was waiting to see an endocrinologist and hoping there's no permanent damage. Keytruda almost finished me off",Sunflower
8,Keytruda,Melanoma,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 3, 2018",31,My 79 year old husband died having 2 treatments of Keytruda.  He declined over 1 month it was horrible. I am so upset and was told immunotherapy killed him. His oncologist said the toxic side effects took his life. I believe it is responsible  for his death,shorty
9,Keytruda,Melanoma,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 9, 2017",21,This drug gave me all kind of side effects that made it impossible to continue taking the drug.
