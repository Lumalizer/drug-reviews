0,Opdivo,Melanoma,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 24, 2022",0,"I had a spot of melanoma skin cancer on my side, and it spread to two lymph nodes. All the cancer was removed by surgery. No more cancer, but Opdivo was strongly recommended as a preventative. I was told there may be side effects with Opdivo, but had no idea of what that really meant, or how severe they could be. I was put on the once a month regimen so was given the double dose. A few days later my daughter rushed me to the hospital with a fluttering heart and a pulse way over a hundred. My body was beginning to experience massive inflammation. Opdivo attacked my heart, thyroid, liver, eyes (double vision), severe muscle pain, no control of bowels, severe rash and itching, extreme weakness. I was put on six weeks of prednisone to as they said, ""put out the fire"". The Opdivo had already done its damage to my heart, had to have a catheter ablation, and I will be on thyroid medication the rest of my life. Don't just jump into Opdivo, do your own your own research, or have someone help.",J P
1,Opdivo,Melanoma,2,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 15, 2021",0,"Boyfriend diagnosed with 3C Metastatic Melanoma in 2017.  Surgery (WLE) to remove tumor in upper arm and several lymph nodes removed.   One year of monthly Opdivo infusions following surgery.  Hasnâ€™t been the same since.  Multiple infections and syndromes (C-diff, diverticulitis, SIADH...) one thing after another.  He has lost a ton of weight and is pretty much bedridden 20 hrs per day.  In his case I truly question whether the benefits outweigh the risks. After watching his decline, I would have serious reservations.  NO quality of life at 64 years old.",FoothillFilly
2,Opdivo,Melanoma,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 17, 2019",26,My husband has stage 4 melanoma that developed tumors in both lungs 2 years after the melanoma was surgically removed.  His infusion were a combination of the Yervoy and Opdivo.  His tumors have shrunk to being almost undetectable on the left side and very small on the right.  No side effects except a rash which was treated with steroids or ointment.   We are beyond thrilled.  This is an amazing medication.,Oldiebutgoodywife
3,Opdivo,Melanoma,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 6, 2019",15,"After two treatments of Opdivo for Melanoma my father experienced many of the side effects, including muscle weakness, swelling (including in his brain), loss of appetite, constipation, droopy eye muscles, blurred vision, and irregular heartbeats and blood pressure. He is currently being treated at the Mayo Clinic in the ICU. He is the third case they have seen with similar reactions, but are having trouble treating the side effects. Thankfully he sought help before the symptoms worsened. My advice is to learn the side effects, and immediately let you doctor know if they appear.",Ivy M
4,Opdivo,Melanoma,1,,"October 17, 2018",21,"My sister (age 35) was diagnosed with melanoma April 2018. The cancer had spread to her Lymph-nodes but was confirmed to have not spread to any organs. In May 2018, after removal of 40 lymph-nodes, she had no detectable melanomas. She immediately began her infusions. Pain started within the first 2 treatments, but was determined to be a side effect of this treatment. Then in early September she was in such pain she went to the emergency room. It was shortly confirmed that she had large tumors were pretty much everywhere except her brain. Within 3 weeks she died. This treatment in no way worked, indeed her oncologist believes it actually accelerated her melanoma. Please consider not using this treament, it is like playing a game of  roulette! For those that it doesn't work on, it REALLY doesn't work. She would have lived much longer by just dealing with the tumors as they arose and without the last 3 months of her life filled with terrible pain.",Amos
5,Opdivo,Melanoma,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 19, 2018",15,"Everything was going  well on the 2 week treatment for 8 weeks- then doctor tried to do a monthly dose and my sugar skyrockets to almost 500. I was hospitalized and had to start insulin shots! Still on shots for about a week hoping things get back to normal after the Opdivo is out of my system, just not sure how long that will take.",Paul
