0,Nivolumab,Melanoma,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 24, 2022",0,"Opdivo (nivolumab):I had a spot of melanoma skin cancer on my side, and it spread to two lymph nodes. All the cancer was removed by surgery. No more cancer, but Opdivo was strongly recommended as a preventative. I was told there may be side effects with Opdivo, but had no idea of what that really meant, or how severe they could be. I was put on the once a month regimen so was given the double dose. A few days later my daughter rushed me to the hospital with a fluttering heart and a pulse way over a hundred. My body was beginning to experience massive inflammation. Opdivo attacked my heart, thyroid, liver, eyes (double vision), severe muscle pain, no control of bowels, severe rash and itching, extreme weakness. I was put on six weeks of prednisone to as they said, ""put out the fire"". The Opdivo had already done its damage to my heart, had to have a catheter ablation, and I will be on thyroid medication the rest of my life. Don't just jump into Opdivo, do your own your own research, or have someone help.",J P
1,Nivolumab,Melanoma,2,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 15, 2021",0,"Opdivo (nivolumab):Boyfriend diagnosed with 3C Metastatic Melanoma in 2017.  Surgery (WLE) to remove tumor in upper arm and several lymph nodes removed.   One year of monthly Opdivo infusions following surgery.  Hasnâ€™t been the same since.  Multiple infections and syndromes (C-diff, diverticulitis, SIADH...) one thing after another.  He has lost a ton of weight and is pretty much bedridden 20 hrs per day.  In his case I truly question whether the benefits outweigh the risks. After watching his decline, I would have serious reservations.  NO quality of life at 64 years old.",FoothillFilly
2,Nivolumab,Melanoma,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 17, 2019",26,Opdivo (nivolumab):My husband has stage 4 melanoma that developed tumors in both lungs 2 years after the melanoma was surgically removed.  His infusion were a combination of the Yervoy and Opdivo.  His tumors have shrunk to being almost undetectable on the left side and very small on the right.  No side effects except a rash which was treated with steroids or ointment.   We are beyond thrilled.  This is an amazing medication.,Oldiebutgoodywife
3,Nivolumab,Melanoma,8,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 17, 2019",5,"My boyfriend was diagnosed with Stage IIIC Melanoma in February 2018.  I am fairly sure he had been sick for a few years prior to diagnosis.  He had a 5.5 cm tumor excised from his upper arm and 18 axillary lymph nodes removed (one node lit thus the IIIC staging diagnosis.)  Opdivo 480 once per month started in March 2018.  He finished his last infusion on 4/2/2019.  No Evidence of Disease as of last PET scan.  The side effects have been extreme fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea and rash.  He has and continues to take Prednisone daily.  He also has prescription steroid creams for the rash.  He expected to feel better right away after his final infusion, this has not happened yet.  Still very low energy and he sleeps a lot.  Hoping he feels better very soon.  Considering that until the last few years only traditional chemo regimen and/or Interferon were available we consider ourselves quite fortunate that Opdivo was made available.  Time will tell.  I hope an actual cure is found soon.",NoCalgirl
4,Nivolumab,Melanoma,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 6, 2019",15,"Opdivo (nivolumab):After two treatments of Opdivo for Melanoma my father experienced many of the side effects, including muscle weakness, swelling (including in his brain), loss of appetite, constipation, droopy eye muscles, blurred vision, and irregular heartbeats and blood pressure. He is currently being treated at the Mayo Clinic in the ICU. He is the third case they have seen with similar reactions, but are having trouble treating the side effects. Thankfully he sought help before the symptoms worsened. My advice is to learn the side effects, and immediately let you doctor know if they appear.",Ivy M
5,Nivolumab,Melanoma,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 11, 2018",6,"I had two treatments of Nivolumab two weeks apart.  When I went in for my third treatment I mentioned that my muscles were sore.  They did not do the third treatment and recommended that I see a Rheumatology Doctor.  Saw her one week later and she sent me for blood work.  Got a call that night that my sugars were above 600 and I needed to check into my preferred Emergency room.  Spent 3 days in the hospital adjusting my sugars.  At home I have to test my blood 4 times a day and inject insulin according to the numbers.  They do not think my pancreas is improving and that I might have to continue this for life.  ""Diabetes"".  A week later it was discovered that my Thyroid was very low.  Now on Thyroid medication.  Debated whether to even start Nivolumab injections, because of all the side effects, but were advised by most of my doctors to start it and then I could always stop if side effects occurred. I guess you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.  Live and learn.",Robert
6,Nivolumab,Melanoma,1,,"October 17, 2018",21,"Opdivo (nivolumab):My sister (age 35) was diagnosed with melanoma April 2018. The cancer had spread to her Lymph-nodes but was confirmed to have not spread to any organs. In May 2018, after removal of 40 lymph-nodes, she had no detectable melanomas. She immediately began her infusions. Pain started within the first 2 treatments, but was determined to be a side effect of this treatment. Then in early September she was in such pain she went to the emergency room. It was shortly confirmed that she had large tumors were pretty much everywhere except her brain. Within 3 weeks she died. This treatment in no way worked, indeed her oncologist believes it actually accelerated her melanoma. Please consider not using this treament, it is like playing a game of  roulette! For those that it doesn't work on, it REALLY doesn't work. She would have lived much longer by just dealing with the tumors as they arose and without the last 3 months of her life filled with terrible pain.",Amos
7,Nivolumab,Melanoma,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 19, 2018",15,"Opdivo (nivolumab):Everything was going  well on the 2 week treatment for 8 weeks- then doctor tried to do a monthly dose and my sugar skyrockets to almost 500. I was hospitalized and had to start insulin shots! Still on shots for about a week hoping things get back to normal after the Opdivo is out of my system, just not sure how long that will take.",Paul
8,Nivolumab,Melanoma,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 19, 2017",13,Opdivo (nivolumab):My Husband has had wonderful success with this medicine it never made him sick the whole time he has been taking it. He is presently still on it for maintaince,Rosebud8986
9,Nivolumab,Melanoma,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 10, 2015",25,"My mother recieved this treatment as part of a clinical trial for advanced stage 4 melanoma. She was given 9 months to live. As a reality of taking this ""miracle"" drug for Melanoma, she ended up with Adrenal failure and Advanced Diabetes. She died within 7 months. This is not a cure or a means of ""living longer"". Drug companies need to stop feeding on the time patients have left and leave them be. Honestly...do you want to sit with your loved one during their last days and talk and laugh and enjoy your time? Or watch them receive a multitude of medications in a coma state and die?",Mommas baby
