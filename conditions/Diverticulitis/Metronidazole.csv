After reading some of the experiences of others here I started taking it today, 500 mg three times a day, so I hope and pray that it works without any problems. First I was beginning to believe I was coming down with COVID but then it hit me that my diverticulitis was starting to act up and two days later I was on the bathroom floor so cramped up and couldn’t go to the bathroom until about six hours later then war broke our between me and the toilet. I’ve never had a problem with most meds ( antibiotics ) so hope all goes well within the next few days. Not a great way to start the New Year.",Roger Candodger

Pain was excruciating!  Was on this medication ritual for 15 days.  I didn’t realize what these two drugs were doing to my good bacteria in my gut!  Ended up with C-diff!

6,Metronidazole,Diverticulitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2021",1,"I was prescribed Flagyl and Cipro for diverticulitus-14 days-I stopped at 10  (did check dosage) as all info I found on web never went beyond 10 days-I had loose stool, headache, lips felt swollen, rash, nausea and weak.  There were times I just could not take one of the prescribed doses as I felt so horrible - each hour felt like 5 - it was very hard to focus on the end.  Some suggestions helped, take your doses at least 2 hours apart not together, take with applesauce to help with metallic taste (-really worked well)- I was immobile for the 10 days I was on these medications awful.

7,Metronidazole,Diverticulitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 31, 2021",1,"I’m taking it right now for a diverticular flare-up.  Aside from feeling tired, no problems.  Things are starting to settle down in my bowels after only two days. In the past, I was given Metronidazole in tandem with Cipro, which is a common combination.  I had to stop the Cipro because I got severe pain in the tendons in my ankles.  That is a known side effect of Cipro, and in some cases has left people with permanent damage if they are taking it long term.  One thing, they tell you to wait before three days after you are done taking Metronidazole before consuming any alcohol.  Three days is not enough.  I rarely drink but the last time I took the Metronidazole, about 5 days after finishing it, I decided to have a little white wine with a meal, forgetting about the interaction. I thought I was going to die! Immediately facial reddening, rapid heartbeat, etc.  Drank a lot of water to flush whatever drug lingered out of my system.  Take that warning seriously.",Nonny

Ended up in the hospital following three days of oral Cipro and Flagyl that did not work. Three days of IV Flagyl and Cipro helped. But I had to follow up with10 days of oral Cipro and Flagyl in order to get rid of the infection totally. The metallic disgusting taste of Flagyl was horrible. The only way I could get it down, and I will say this works very well, is to take a big spoonful of applesauce, bury the pill in it and swallow it whole. It eliminated the horrible taste after taking the pill. Still had a mild metallic taste on my tongue the whole time I was on the medication. But eliminated the awful taste while taking and following. Flagyl caused a lot of abdominal bloating and I didn’t like the side effects, but the pain from diverticulitis was unbearable. Drank Kombucha every day as a probiotic.

16,Metronidazole,Diverticulitis,10.0,,"March 19, 2021",62,"Metronidazole or Flagyl is very powerful. I have diverticular disease, and the alternative is surgery from flare ups. While I probably will get surgery later on, this is the go-to drug before. It happens between 2-4 times every year, and I know what it feels like when slight cramping and urge to go then escalates to straight up sharp pain within hours. Long story short, this drug is not pleasant. It leaves a metallic/bitter aftertaste in your mouth for the two week duration you are on it, it takes a few days AFTER ceasing the treatment for that to end. But otherwise, it is doing its job. The gas, bloating, cramps, and diarrhea are all symptoms of diverticular disease, not necessarily this drug. This drug is the solution, and it is a powerful one. It is not pleasant, but it works and its cheap. That's my experience using for the past decade with this terrible disease, this drug has kept me off the operation table so far, and I'm hoping it can extend that for several more years until I have no choice.",Beegee

Went to ER and was admitted to the hospital for 5 days for IV Flagyl and Ceftin.  Flagyl is worse than the diverticulitis.  Constant explosive diarrhea, extreme nausea, weak, tired, anxiety to the point of panic, and elevated BP.  Took 5 days in hospital and then 5 days oral once discharged.  My diverticulitis pain has subsided, but the constant diarrhea makes my colon feel like it's been beaten with a baseball bat; I feel internally tender and bruised.

I have done this and it's worked out well, he discussed with me the side effects of the Flagyl and explained it will upset my stomach and to eat when taking it I am only on my meds twice a day and I am done with the prednisone.

26,Metronidazole,Diverticulitis,10.0,,"September 25, 2020",21,Flagyl (metronidazole):A little early to give a thorough report on Flagyl for Diverticulitis. But I have to admit it has helped so far. I have a light case of diverticulitis. Saturday night at midnight I drove myself to ER.  I was in EXTREME PAIN from a hole in colon. It is small so it only is leaking gas into my abdomen.  I was on flagyl IV from Sunday am till Wednesday am.  When I ate even Jell-O the gas pains would come back. 24 hrs after taking the 2x day 500mg the gas pain was gone while/after eating.  No bad taste. No elevated BP.  If this keeps me from needing surgery I would take for months. I am on a 2x day x 7 days.  Drugs work differently on people.  So far. This is a miracle drug for me.  On another good note. I have been a heavy drinker for years.  You can’t drink alcohol while taking. Flagyl could have possibly saved my life in two aspects?,Gregory

It is very stressful on your body. My diverticulitis is better but the side effects of the treatments take a toll on your body.

I could not sleep at all that night or the following three nights.  I lay in bed wide awake, with my leg muscles randomly fasciculating.  I had a headache and neck ache from not being able to sleep.  Occasionally, my entire body would suddenly jerk while I was lying in bed.  I could not concentrate at work, and even though I am a Pharmacist, I kept forgetting the names of medications that I had been taking and the names of the medical conditions with which I had been diagnosed.  I had been taking ibuprofen for a few days the prior week, and I had stopped taking ibuprofen due to heartburn.  Even though I was on Protonix to treat my heartburn, Flagyl significantly worsened my pre-existing heartburn to the point where I had to stand erect throughout the day and night, moaning with pain.  My epigastric pain would begin about an hour after taking Flagyl and be at its worst four hours later.  I also felt as if I constantly had to urinate, but only a small amount of urine would come out each time.  My mouth was extremely dry with a metallic taste and a furry looking tongue.  I ended up in the ER the following Wednesday writhing in epigastric pain which was a 10 on the 1-10 pain scale.  I literally thought that I was going to die, and I spoke with loved ones by phone to say my good-byes.  My blood pressure was moderately elevated and my ECG, which had always been normal, was now borderline with atrial enlargement.  My ER doc switched me to Augmentin, and my Flagyl-related adverse reactions rapidly subsided.  Flagyl significantly helped my diverticulitis, but at a horrible cost in terms of lost sleep, lost work, poor work, personal and family anxieties, and time spent at the ER.  If your doctor prescribes Flagyl, my advice is to ask him/her if there is an alternative antibiotic, especially if you have any pre-existing gastroesophageal problems.All of my adverse events appear in the Flagyl labeling:  epigastric distress, abdominal cramping, incoordination, confusion, insomnia, a sharp, unpleasant metallic taste, dryness of the mouth, furry tongue, glossitis, stomatitis, flattening of the T-wave in electrocardiographic tracings, polyuria, a sense of pelvic pressure, convulsive seizures.

Let me start off by saying these two medications together SUCK, however they DO work. I have never had any problems with medications...ever. (in 40 years) This time though, at times, I thought I was dying! Best described as the worst flu ever. Massive nausea, occasional vomiting, diarrhea, exhaustion, horrible taste in my mouth, nothing tasted good, and my appetite was bad. Day 4 was the peak of feeling awful. I went to every review sight trying to gather what worked to curb the symptoms. Everyone is different so what worked for others, didn't necessarily work for me. Here is what did work for me a bit, in case it can help anyone else. 1.) Try to not take them together. Split up the doses by like an hour or so. 2.) Take each dose with a little food, (even if you aren't hungry) something bland. DO NOT USE DAIRY PRODUCTS. This made my nausea worse! 3.) Have mints or candy at all times. Your mouth will feel gross and things will taste funny. However, I found spearmints also helped sooth the tummy a bit. 4.) Pepto-Bismol. 5.) Try not to take them immediately before bed at night. Give it about an hour or two. I noticed nausea will wake me up throughout the night if I take them to close to going to sleep. GOOD LUCK, and remember: Your doctor prescribed these for a reason. A reason that could turn into life threatening unless you get it controlled.

These led to terrible stomach pain and headache. One pharmacist told me this couldn't happen, not enough alcohol would get in, but another said Yes, it happens, and some people even have a reaction to alcohol in the slight fumes you get while pumping gasoline that includes alcohol.

It never leaves your mouth, no matter what food is eaten.  I can't sleep AT ALL and am having diarhhea.  I have 5 more days to go on a 10 day course of the medicine.

It was quickly effective every time I took it.  I had no negative side effects. The worst was a bad taste in my mouth.  Would take again if needed.,Brodied
