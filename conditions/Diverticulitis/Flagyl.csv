0,Flagyl,Diverticulitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 13, 2022",1,"Have had a bottle of this on my desk for six months and never used it, had a bad bout with diverticulitis for the third time in ten years. After reading some of the experiences of others here I started taking it today, 500 mg three times a day, so I hope and pray that it works without any problems. First I was beginning to believe I was coming down with COVID but then it hit me that my diverticulitis was starting to act up and two days later I was on the bathroom floor so cramped up and couldn’t go to the bathroom until about six hours later then war broke our between me and the toilet. I’ve never had a problem with most meds ( antibiotics ) so hope all goes well within the next few days. Not a great way to start the New Year.",Roger Candodger
1,Flagyl,Diverticulitis,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 30, 2021",0,Waves of nausea and constipation. Seemed to settle the diverticular symptoms at least. Makes you feel generally crap and I can't wait to have the last dose behind me. Worth asking if there are alternatives.,John
2,Flagyl,Diverticulitis,8.0,,"August 31, 2021",0,"The pain from diverticulitis was unbearable. I could hardly walk. Ended up in the hospital following three days of oral Cipro and Flagyl that did not work. Three days of IV Flagyl and Cipro helped. But I had to follow up with10 days of oral Cipro and Flagyl in order to get rid of the infection totally. The metallic disgusting taste of Flagyl was horrible. The only way I could get it down, and I will say this works very well, is to take a big spoonful of applesauce, bury the pill in it and swallow it whole. It eliminated the horrible taste after taking the pill. Still had a mild metallic taste on my tongue the whole time I was on the medication. But eliminated the awful taste while taking and following. Flagyl caused a lot of abdominal bloating and I didn’t like the side effects, but the pain from diverticulitis was unbearable. Drank Kombucha every day as a probiotic. If I wasn’t allergic to penicillin I would pursue a different medication.",Jo S
3,Flagyl,Diverticulitis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 17, 2021",0,"Prescribed this for Diverticulitis.  Dizziness, brain fog, confusion, increased anxiety (which might be because I thought I was dying at one point) and dark urine.  I have taken this med before without these side effects, which is why I didn't tie the side effects to the medication.  I was actually looking to see how other people combat the taste when I stumbled across this.  I mean, for the diverticulitis pain, it works... you just have to figure out a way to deal with the side effects.",Jill

5,Flagyl,Diverticulitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 8, 2020",45,"I have had a recent flare-up of diverticulitis, and was given Metronidazole (Flagyl) and Cipro for 10 days.  I immediately started have severe gastritis (severe pain and burning) in my stomach.  I suspected it was the metronidazole and every day the situation became worse!  I developed painful urination and bladder symptoms, sores in my mouth, and severe stomach burning/heartburn.  I read online that these were serious side effects of metronidazole.  I had to stop the metronidazole after 5 days, even though my doctor insisted that I take it.  Bladder symptoms resolved in 24 hours after stopping the drug.   It has been 5 weeks and my stomach is still on fire.  I can’t eat properly as everything causes me stomach pain. I am now scheduled for an endoscopy to see what is wrong with my stomach and esophagus.  I will NEVER take metronidazole again!",FloidaGal

7,Flagyl,Diverticulitis,10.0,,"September 25, 2020",21,A little early to give a thorough report on Flagyl for Diverticulitis. But I have to admit it has helped so far. I have a light case of diverticulitis. Saturday night at midnight I drove myself to ER.  I was in EXTREME PAIN from a hole in colon. It is small so it only is leaking gas into my abdomen.  I was on flagyl IV from Sunday am till Wednesday am.  When I ate even Jell-O the gas pains would come back. 24 hrs after taking the 2x day 500mg the gas pain was gone while/after eating.  No bad taste. No elevated BP.  If this keeps me from needing surgery I would take for months. I am on a 2x day x 7 days.  Drugs work differently on people.  So far. This is a miracle drug for me.  On another good note. I have been a heavy drinker for years.  You can’t drink alcohol while taking. Flagyl could have possibly saved my life in two aspects?,Gregory

I was asked to take Flagyl for 7 days. By day 2 I was already in pain with side effects with bad muscle cramps especially my legs. I kept going not realizing the damage it was doing. On day 6 I gave up. The side effects were unbearable. I was taking regular pro-biotics during this period and after. Flagyl wiped my gut clean to the extreme that I kept getting urine Infections / Cystitis (inflammation of the bladder) for weeks after. The constant urine infections / Cystitis continued for the next 5 months. Eventually when I saw my naturopath, he gave me a special blend of flora (pro-biotics) to help restore my gut back to normal.

14,Flagyl,Diverticulitis,3.0,,"August 27, 2019",108,"First diverticulitis (DVT) attack, was in such pain & had been in a very stressful situation. I had  CT and diagnosed with DVT and prescribed flagyl & cipro. Became very ill, nauseated, headache, confused, lost my way back to husband's hospital room. Very frightening & debilitating. Called former GI dr & he took me off 1 of the drugs & I slogged it out & finally got well again but at what cost?I'm 1 that get frequent flare ups. Now take 250 mg amoxicillin 3X day for 10 days which is very inexpensive & have no side effects. Nothing to compare to the horrible , torturous side effects of those other 2 drugs. I sought advice from 3 GI drs, and consulted 3 colorectal surgeons. It is hard to imagine that they still do not really know what causes these DVT flare ups. It's all best guess & try this or try that. With so many people suffering from DVT I can't find a major study being conducted to ID any specific bacteria that seems to get out of hand causing these repeated infections.",Mary

No major side effects provided that I used probiotics and yogurt religiously during the week long course. I would take a probiotics about 1-2 hours before dosage, then eat a yogurt, then another probiotic 1-2 hours after each dose. I was on a soft diet anyhow.

The nausea and stomach ache are horrible.  I am now on the 7th day and this morning I began thinking about why the problems remain so many hours after I take the drugs. I thought perhaps the drugs were not dissolving properly, so I cut the pills in half and took them in 2 pieces. I have not had nausea or stomach pain today.

18,Flagyl,Diverticulitis,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 2, 2019",107,I have had Diverticulosis for years.  The first attack was awful.  Went to ER.  So very very sick.  Did the Flagyl/Cipro routine.  felt worse.  Over the years I have discovered many things. First of all you DO NOT WANT TO TAKE CIPRO. Google up Cipro.  It is poison and even have groups of people with horror stories about Cipro.FLAGYL:  All you have to do is ask your doctor to write brand medically necessary and the pills come coated with a smooth blue coating that slides down easily and do not dissolve in your mouth so no bad taste when taking taking Flagyl.  If you have diverticulosis and get flares of diverticulitis do not wait.  IMMEDIATELY start on flagyl  A lot of the symptoms you all describe are not from the pills they are from the disease.  No Cipro and start Flagyl immediately.  I keep a supply always in the house.,SIGLEINDA
19,Flagyl,Diverticulitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 17, 2018",38,"I'm all to familiar with the Flagyl/Cipro combination......I've dealt with diverticulitis many times/years. I have tried several ways to get through the unpleasant task of ingesting  these medications. I found that alternating one pill every 6 hours instead of taking two pills every 12 hours really helped. Also, taking milk with the Flagyl and making sure you eat 2 hours before and after to taking Cipro really makes a difference. Keep hydrated also. I do get the metallic taste and find that drinking water just makes it worse. I'm a huge water lover but not when taking these meds. I drink water that is cut with juice. I hope this helps.",Kelly

I have never had side effects like this. Debilitating nausea, headaches, chills and sweats, lethargy, metallic taste, diarrhea and I am having trouble sleeping because of the nausea and my upset stomach.

I was diagnosed with diverticulitis and was prescribed Flagyl, Bactrim, and Tramadol, none of which I have taken before. Gag! That's all I've been doing since taking the antibiotics, that and the hot & cold sweats, and feeling terrible. The worst is the Tramadol which after the third dose I will not take another. I felt terrible anxiety and googled that drug and found that is a side effect in some people. I'm sipping chamomile tea to try to help the gagging with little relief but I am taking in fluids. I have no appetite, food makes me gag when I look at it. It was good to read others comments that this is expected with the antibiotics. This is day 2, I have 5 more to go.",ADB
22,Flagyl,Diverticulitis,8.0,,"September 15, 2018",30,"I went to ER with acute diverticulitis and was prescribed Metronidazole along with Cipro and pain pills.  I was administered a couple pain shots and thought I could go home and take these meds and get better.  Three days later I was back in the ER and let them admit me this time.  The terrible headaches, horrific taste in my mouth, nausea and vomiting was about more than I could bare.  I have had sleeve surgery and so my stomach is small, but this gave me such bad heartburn and indigestion, I could not imaging a medicine making a person this sick.  I, also, had diarrhea with every bathroom trip and very dark urine.  I couldn't even stand the taste of water or the food I ate tasted horrible along with a lack of appetite, lethargy, and light headedness.  I finished my prescription of ten days, but I hope  I never have to take this horrible drug again.

23,Flagyl,Diverticulitis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 7, 2018",97,"I am a Flagyl survivor. Today I finish my 48 hours of it getting out of my system following 7 harrowing days of physical assault. Day 3 brought debilitating  stomach pain, incapacitating nausea, dizziness/brain fog. The hospital had to confirm for me that the diverticulitis was not worse it was the medication’s side effects. What??? Is this 2018? I am a healthcare provider and this has given me insight into people’s distrust of the medical profession. The medicine first patented in 1963...now in generic form...and never an attempt to refine the med to reduce side effects?  Or produce alternatives? I have an intense full time job, got lucky I was sick over the long weekend (????) and just made it through day 6 and 7 at work with the use of partially effective Zofran (anti-nausea). Find any alternative drug or treatment. I just lost 10 days of my life first to illness then to the treatment. I believe quality of life matters. Good luck diverticulitis suffers!

25,Flagyl,Diverticulitis,7.0,,"July 29, 2018",32,Took Cipro and Flagyl for a Diverticulitis flare up.  I paid extra for the name brand of Cipro. Generic brand gave me all the nasty side effects people are sharing.  I also found I ate something before taking either meds made a huge difference.

I have gone 2 years since my last bout with diverticulitis.  At first I hated the drugs and quit after 2-3 days - only for the pain to come back within a month.  So I quickly learned to stay the course of the drugs, then I learned to monitor my diet better because my eating habits was the culprit. When I was 43, I had a flare up from diverticulitis, since I was used to the symptoms I drank a lot of water and tried to get by the pain, not a good idea man that diverticulitis spread through my urine tract, then to my liver...all because I didn’t want to take the medication...probably the worse episode",Seandini

Because I had pretty rough experiences with Flagyl / Cipro combination in my previous episodes, I asked for the pharmacist to advise me, with my prior history in mind. I really wanted this time to be different. He said the most important advice is DO NOT USE ALCOHOL, which sounds like common sense; but that includes mouthwash. (you might swallow a bit)  It's a slow recovery; absolutely. I live in So Cal and this was during a heat wave, but I slept day and night the first few days with a heating pad on my lower adbomen.

Just put me on antibiotics as soon as I get symptoms because I always go into the fever eventually . Yes going on this for  7 to 10 days can give you diarrhea.  I found quite a while ago since probiotic yogurt came out as long as I eat lots of that I rarely get diarrhea now.

50,Flagyl,Diverticulitis,7.0,,"November 13, 2015",69,"Day 3 on Flagyl and Cipro. I thought I was having a heart attack. This stuff has horrid side effects. Discomfort in my chest and arm. Foggy headed feeling,  dizziness, unbalanced, headache, very nauseous,  metal taste, very blurry eyesight. No energy, at 55 it is not a good thing to feel this way, especially when you are overweight and out of shape. This is only day 3 I don't think I can take this stuff for 7 more days. They say the IV kind is worse though. Supposedly it's helping (I do feel less pain in my abdomen I think). IF I make it through this stuff I bet I will watch what I eat and make better choices in the future. I called the pharmacy and the doc and both said to stay on it, cipro 2X daily and flagyl 4X daily. Scary stuff.",Anonymous

Had some side effects but not sure which medication they came from. Plus the diverticulitis itself  causes gas, bloating, diarrhea, headache, nausea so how do you know what was meds and what was the illness? I experienced urine discoloration-slight rusty tone. I can say that the taste of the Flagyl pill is horrible. Also, after starting the meds I became over sensitive to smells and everything I ate or drank, even water, tasted disgusting. (Not so bad as I'm not supposed to be eating foods). I found that if I swallow the Flagyl with a sip of a  smoothie (from supermarket) it slips down easy with no sticking and no bad taste.",metalmaiden

No nausea with the Flagyl alone but about an hour after adding the cipro the exhaustion and nausea are awful.  Also, dark urine and diarrhea which are unsettling but sound normal.",Gardengirl67

Stomach cramps and pretty much constant nausea all day today (day 2). Eventually had to leave work early. Pepto did not help. Going to try taking Nauzene with me to work tomorrow, see if it helps.

Came back to work today and I am SO NAUSEOUS! The bad taste in my mouth has returned, and I really don't feel well at all.

There are some issues I have had taking them such as low energy level, limited concentration when getting tired, but most of all nausea. I recommend if you are going to be taking either or both of these meds always take with plenty of food (meal time not just a snack), don't plan on doing too much (you won't have the energy), and ask your Doctor for a as needed prescription of a nausea medicine just in case you need it.

I believe it is working because my abdominal pain has significantly decreased since being diagnosed with diverticulitis about 1 week ago.  I am also taking Cipro. The reported side effect of having a metallic taste is very understated! Not only do I have an AWFUL paint/chemical taste constantly in my mouth, but my sense of smell is on overdrive! This has contributed significantly to my loss of appetite, nausea, and in many cases my inability to function.
