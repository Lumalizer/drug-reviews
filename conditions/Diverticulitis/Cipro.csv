0,Cipro,Diverticulitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 17, 2022",2,"Started taking this with the flagyl, oh goodness did it ever mess me up bad starting one hour after the first, no reason to get into detail because you can read all the other reviews but whatever you do don’t take this unless it’s a complete emergency and even then ask your dr for something different.",Junior
1,Cipro,Diverticulitis,1.0,,"December 29, 2021",5,Horrible drug. I was given Cipro and flygl when my CRP rose to 140. Completed the course even after I got rashes. Now I have been suffering a lot after that both physically and mentally. I think that doctor prescribed me to suffer when those were not needed for a young man like me.,Anonymous
2,Cipro,Diverticulitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2020",25,"I was given Cipro for mild uncomplicated Diverticulitis. Not only did it not help, but it caused me to be drug resistant and I got the Super Bug, C Dificile. That nearly  was the end of me. The infectious disease doctor said people should stay away from Cipro. It is causing serious issues!",Gilda
3,Cipro,Diverticulitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 25, 2019",25,I have taken Cipro for bronchitis numerous times & I am now taking it for diverticulitis. I have never had any bad side effects from taking it. It has always worked for me.,Anonymous
4,Cipro,Diverticulitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 4, 2019",60,"DO NOT TAKE THIS POISON!  I was given Cipro for Diverticulitis 2 years ago. Please read every precaution & side effect of this drug. It effects your DNA, and never leaves your body. My right leg went into a spasm, I couldn't walk for over a month.! The tendons and ligaments in my ankles, knees, thumbs, neck and back started cracking , which has caused a crippling affect to this day. All the toes in my left foot are numb. It has changed my life and I still have depressing days. My advice is never take this drug, you will never be the same!  Just research Floxie Hope to see how many others have been affected",PES
5,Cipro,Diverticulitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 7, 2018",15,"Worked, no obvious side effects.  Took the last pills yesterday (Cipro + Flagyl).  I have been taking a probiotic as well.",Tom
6,Cipro,Diverticulitis,5.0,,"June 18, 2018",25,"This works, but the side effects are horrible. Nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, right-side neck and shoulder pain and stiffness, mental fog and general malaise. This medication has ""black box"" warnings I was never told, what a mess. Quitting after 5 days and hoping for the best. Nasty stuff! If there is an alternative, they should not even prescribe this stuff!",Yazmine
7,Cipro,Diverticulitis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 22, 2018",19,"I took it twice, once in August and again in December.  Since this drug is so strong it stays in your body for a long time. I ended up with Kidney Failure and ended up Hospitalized!  Very scary, I was close to going on dialysis. Never, ever taking this drug again!",Lmp
8,Cipro,Diverticulitis,9.0,,"October 22, 2016",23,"Taking Cipro made me almost sicker than the bout of pain.  I couldn't function, slept most of every day.  Developed thrush, heavily coated tongue. Staggering when walking, off balance at times, thinking process was not normal, crying jags for no reason.  This drug in the class of quinolones causes CNS problems.  I will never take another in that class.  Diarrhea was continuing days after the 10 day course was done.  Read Cipro can actually cause C. difficile and Immodium can aggravate that!  It's been one month since I started the ten day course of Cipro and still having side effects of CNS.",M E P
9,Cipro,Diverticulitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2016",29,Cipro was horrible. I have never had a reaction to an antibiotic before. Mentally disturbed head. It was very strange and made me panicky. Broke out in a rash on forearms and itchy tight chest.  Read how awful this drug is. Thank goodness my reaction happened after a few doses and not a week or two. Flouriquinolones are poison for me. I never would have thought an antibiotic could be so harmful.,Sbrb
10,Cipro,Diverticulitis,8.0,,"February 16, 2013",58,Cleared up but terrible taste in mouth...but better than alternative.,wawah pain
11,Cipro,Diverticulitis,5.0,,"February 28, 2012",52,By day 6 Cipro was helping with the symptoms but I started having blurred vision.  Day 7 vision even more blurred and had a headache and pain behind right eye.  Doctor took me off Cipro and put me on Doxycycline.,Anonymous
12,Cipro,Diverticulitis,9.0,,"December 20, 2011",108,"Kills diverticulitis quick for me, typically by the 3rd or 4th dose.",hellotheremate
13,Cipro,Diverticulitis,7.0,,"August 12, 2011",56,"Last year, when I had my first diverticulitis attack (a bad one), I was put on Cipro and Flagyl.  Condition did clear up although I was left with a nasty case of Thrush.  This time only on Cipro - don't find the one medicine alone very effective.  I'm nearing the end of my prescription (10 days of 2 per day) and still having some pain and nausea.  Will see my doctor next week.",Anonymous
14,Cipro,Diverticulitis,10.0,,"March 16, 2010",111,Have used once or twice a year for last 10 years and start to have relief within 24 hours with symptoms usually gone by day three.  I take two a day after first tinge of pain (you know what I am talking about) and continue for one week minimum or two days more than symptoms persist.  Makes me a little fatigued and I start to get diarrhea after about 4 days but it is worth it.,mature
15,Cipro,Diverticulitis,8.0,,"December 14, 2009",86,"Nausea after 3rd day. Some disorientation-dizziness on 6th dayNervousness-shakiness after 4 days. DOES KILL the bacteria well, though.",Anonymouos
