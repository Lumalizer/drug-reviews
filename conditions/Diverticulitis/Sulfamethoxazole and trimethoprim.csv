0,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Diverticulitis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 4, 2021",6,"We all agree, this medication is horrible. I have to take it for reoccurring bouts of Diverticulitis, along with Flagyl.  I refuse to take Cipro because it ruins ligaments.  I have found some things that help.  Powerade Zero is a lifesaver because Bactrim tanks your electrolytes.  I buy a 12 pack when I have to take Bactrim.  Take this medication with food, and drink plenty of filtered water.  Eat sugar Free Yogurt. Chobani Zero is good. Eat a clean diet as much as you can.  Take a probiotic 2 hours before or two hours after you take Bactrim. It will do no good taking it at the same time.  If you develop yeast (I always do), despite taking a probiotic, you can use caprylic acid gel caps.  Make sure you take the probiotics at least a month as Bactrim stays in your system 1-2 weeks.  CBD oil helps with the insomnia, nausea, and anxiety it causes.  Soda crackers are good for the nausea. Hydrate with Powerade daily! Move your bowels regular. Prunelax helps! Hope this helps! Hang in there!",Kay

Bactrim makes me feel like I'm walking around in some drug induced stupor. My tongue is irritated, I'm itchy. This drug should be pulled off the market.",LB
2,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Diverticulitis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 17, 2020",18,"Bactrim DS (sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim):My doctor has me taking Bactrim DS daily for Diverticulitis as whatâ€™s called a prophylactic, or a prevention of inflammation. It helps me very much as I have not had an inflammation in several years. You must take it every day. And of course you must know whether or not you are allergic to any Sulfa medications.",Tominfl

Thankfully I was able to rest, but had trouble sleeping. Almost done the course - grin and bear it, it is working",LM

6,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Diverticulitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 15, 2018",3,I took Bactrim for diverticulitis. Within hours of taking my skin began itching between my fingers and vagina. I only took one and by morning I had a severe yeast infection and blisters on my hands between my fingers and in my mouth. This was from one pill .... the yeast infection and blisters went all up my backside. I had a very severe reaction. Took 6 days to get over one pill. I would not recommend this to anyone. I will never take it again.,Hunibee
7,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Diverticulitis,8.0,,"May 11, 2010",124,"Bactrim DS (sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim):I have frequent episodes of diverticulitis. My doctor prescribes a 10-day supply of Bactrim DS. Many times 10 days is not enough to completely clear up the problem so I wind up needing an additional 10 days worth of medicine.I have not had any bad side effects from this drug. I wish someone would create a drug to prevent diverticulitis.",Anonymous
