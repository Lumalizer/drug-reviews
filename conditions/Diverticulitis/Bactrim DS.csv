2,Bactrim DS,Diverticulitis,8,,"May 11, 2010",124,"I have frequent episodes of diverticulitis. My doctor prescribes a 10-day supply of Bactrim DS. Many times 10 days is not enough to completely clear up the problem so I wind up needing an additional 10 days worth of medicine.I have not had any bad side effects from this drug. I wish someone would create a drug to prevent diverticulitis.",Anonymous
