1,Ciprofloxacin,Diverticulitis,1.0,,"December 29, 2021",5,Cipro (ciprofloxacin):Horrible drug. I was given Cipro and flygl when my CRP rose to 140. Completed the course even after I got rashes. Now I have been suffering a lot after that both physically and mentally. I think that doctor prescribed me to suffer when those were not needed for a young man like me.,Anonymous

4,Ciprofloxacin,Diverticulitis,1.0,,"January 2, 2021",8,"I developed diarrhea that even OTC Immodium could not stop, along with a low-grade fever. I went to the ER to be evaluated, and the ER doctor diagnosed diverticulitis, prescribing 500 mg ciprofloxacin tablets to be taken 3 times a day, for 10 days. Three days later, I was almost completely paralyzed and feeling intense, sharp pains throughout my body any time I tried to move. Every tendon in my body was completely frozen. I returned to the ER, and the doctor immediately had a MORPHINE drip administered (yes, the pain was THAT BAD), and told me to cease taking the ciprofloxacin. This occurred 3 years ago, and fortunately I did physically recover from what I consider to be a ""poisoning,"" without any lasting side effects. But, the horrible experience that ciprofloxacin put me through has left me traumatized, to the point where I heavily scrutinize any new medication that is prescribed to me by my doctors. IMO, ciprofloxacin is a dangerous drug that needs to be banned.",Prairie Rose
5,Ciprofloxacin,Diverticulitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 17, 2020",7,"I took this antibiotic ciprofloxacin as a precaution to make sure my diverticulitis abscess was cleared up.  It was healing on Amoxicillin already.  I only took it two days and the side effects were extreme.  I couldn't even get up.  What really makes me angry is that now my finger tips are cold, all the time, even when it's hot outside.  I have livestock and I'm outdoors normally without even wearing gloves all winter long.  Now my fingers are nearly frozen in minutes!  This medication should only be taken as a last resort if your other choice is a terminal condition",Sherry

7,Ciprofloxacin,Diverticulitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 15, 2020",15,I have taken Cipro every time I have had a flare-up. I have had no side effects. I highly recommend NOT taking a generic version of any antibiotic let alone this one.Quality control can be an issue in generic versions.   Follow the directions how to and when to take it and never...ever...double dose. If you miss a dosage...screw it u miss it.  If you're in pain be smart don't be risky.,Anonymous

To the point where I was home alone and had to call 911 as I was going in and out of consciousness.  Paramedics arrived and I couldn't stop the vomiting and pooping. All the way to the hospital. While in ER the  diarrhea was so bad and uncontrollable to the point that the floor was pooled with this mess. I was sent home with a diaper and a different medication. I refused to take. Got better a week later with nothing but now 8 months later the diverticulitis is back.",Bella
13,Ciprofloxacin,Diverticulitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 14, 2019",15,"How is ciprofloxacin still legal??  It has annihilated me, my joints, and my immunity.   It’s been a year now and I still can’t walk right, and I’ve had continued issues with immunity.  My hips, and my achilles which I never had an issue with a constant medical issue.  If you feel anything going on in any joint that doesn’t feel right, stop moving and stop this poison!  Do not take this, even if you think you’ve taken a before and you’ve been fine. If anyone is up for a class action suit, I am happy to join in! The problem is, the doctor had prescribed, and a Doctor who screwed up my colonoscopy that caused the gut infection, will not admit to any issues with Cipro and keeps prescribing it. Listen to these reviews.    I even asked my doctor if I should take it after reading the blackbox warnings and reviews and she said this is the standard protocol  and I was very healthy and there was no reason to feel I was at risk . I hope it doesn’t kill me in the end.  It is that bad.",Wren
14,Ciprofloxacin,Diverticulitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 22, 2019",16,I’ve taken Cipro a few times mostly for diverticulitis.  Never had any major issues as long as I took probiotics religiously as well as lots of yogurt and soft meals.  Kind of comes with the territory having a terrible diverticulitis flare which landed me in the hospital.  4 days of IV antibiotics (Zosyn) and home with oral antibiotics of cipro and Flagyl.  After a few days there is some slight nausea but nothing terrible and quite manageable with ginger tea and rest.,Usnvetak1

Please read every precaution & side effect of this drug. It effects your DNA, and never leaves your body. My right leg went into a spasm, I couldn't walk for over a month.! The tendons and ligaments in my ankles, knees, thumbs, neck and back started cracking , which has caused a crippling affect to this day. All the toes in my left foot are numb.

16,Ciprofloxacin,Diverticulitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 2, 2018",20,"This drug is not a joke. I foolishly did not read the patient information before taking these pills. Read the patient information before you take this. This drug should come with a warning and it should be illegal to dispense it without a huge warning. After 3 days I had such severe panic attacks I thought I was going to die. Insomnia and the worst panic attacks I have ever felt in my 52 years of living. Then came the nausea, vomiting, wretching with an empty stomach and more abdominal pain which I already had when I started this. My feet were on fire and I had shooting pains in my legs and horrible muscle pain. I could not drive, I could not focus, I could not remember anything from one minute to the next. I have been ""floxied"" and from what I read that is very serious. I feel it will take months for me to repair the damage done to my body after 3 days of this drug. It was not worth the risk and I completely regret it.",canuck55

Likely not a coincidence.

Shortly after taking I would become increasingly warm, cheeks bright red, intense chest pain and short of breath. I had taken this medication twice before and didn't recall this side effect (Levaquin made me agitated).

As soon as I started taking this drug I started getting hip pain so bad I couldn't even walk to the bathroom.  I went to Physical therapy, Aquatic Therapy, Massage Therapy and nothing helped.  I finally put two and two together that every time I took Cipro this happened.  When I was diagnosed with Diverticulitis I was given intravenous Cipro and Flagyl and although it helped the pain and swollen stomach by the 3rd day the hip pain was getting really bad again.  My doctor says Cipro would not cause this but everybody in my Diverticulitis support group has experience the same thing.  My foot was even super painful.",Squadcar

Developed thrush, heavily coated tongue. Staggering when walking, off balance at times, thinking process was not normal, crying jags for no reason.  This drug in the class of quinolones causes CNS problems.  I will never take another in that class.  Diarrhea was continuing days after the 10 day course was done.

24,Ciprofloxacin,Diverticulitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 3, 2016",34,"I was on metronidazole (flagyl) & ciprofloxacin for diverticulitis. Let me start off by saying these two medications together SUCK, however they DO work. I have never had any problems with medications...ever. (in 40 years) This time though, at times, I thought I was dying! Best described as the worst flu ever. Massive nausea, occasional vomiting, diarrhea, exhaustion, horrible taste in my mouth, nothing tasted good, and my appetite was bad. Day 4 was the peak of feeling awful. I went to every review sight trying to gather what worked to curb the symptoms. Everyone is different so what worked for others, didn't necessarily work for me. Here is what did work for me a bit, in case it can help anyone else. 1.) Try to not take them together. Split up the doses by like an hour or so. 2.) Take each dose with a little food, (even if you aren't hungry) something bland. DO NOT USE DAIRY PRODUCTS. This made my nausea worse! 3.) Have mints or candy at all times. Your mouth will feel gross and things will taste funny. However, I found spearmints also helped sooth the tummy a bit. 4.) Pepto-Bismol. 5.) Try not to take them immediately before bed at night. Give it about an hour or two. I noticed nausea will wake me up throughout the night if I take them to close to going to sleep. GOOD LUCK, and remember: Your doctor prescribed these for a reason. A reason that could turn into life threatening unless you get it controlled. The worst thing ever is to start taking an antibiotic and then stopping it mid-cycle as your body then becomes immune to it and is essentially ineffective.",AmyS1006
25,Ciprofloxacin,Diverticulitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2016",29,Cipro (ciprofloxacin):Cipro was horrible. I have never had a reaction to an antibiotic before. Mentally disturbed head. It was very strange and made me panicky. Broke out in a rash on forearms and itchy tight chest.  Read how awful this drug is. Thank goodness my reaction happened after a few doses and not a week or two. Flouriquinolones are poison for me. I never would have thought an antibiotic could be so harmful.,Sbrb

Was sent for an immediate bloodtest which showed signs of infection. was prescribed cipro and flagyl and was sent for barium for ct scan of the abdomen the next morning. The barium produced severe diarrhea but ct showed acute inflammation of the colon.I took the cipro and flagyl and was nauseated and had diarrhea for 7 days. I finished the flagyl but had 3 more days of cipro to go. On the 8th day the nausea and weakness was so bad along with back pain and joint pain. I couldn't take it any more, so I quit the cipro 2 days early.24 hours later I resumed my multivitamins and simvistatin and had a little diarrhea but has stopped now.",starrynites
27,Ciprofloxacin,Diverticulitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 26, 2016",9,"Whilst this may have worked well on the diverticulitis, the side effects were so awful.  I used Cipro for 10 days in April, and was almost crippled with heel pain in my left foot, and big toe pain in my right foot.  I had to put a box in my bed to keep the sheets off the foot, it was so painful.  Once off the Cipro, my heel and toe pain slowly lessened, but I had a serious diverticulitis flare-up last week and they put me back on it in hospital.  Despite telling the doctors about the heel pain (imagined, they said) they prescribed it to me when I went home.  Then I started doing some research.  Am now off the Cipro and will never take it again; just hoping the damage done to my tendons isn't permanent.  Back on Augmentin.",Doogs
28,Ciprofloxacin,Diverticulitis,5.0,,"June 20, 2015",8,Was prescribed cipro 2x/day with Flagyl 3x/day and they seemed to work although not as quickly as other reviewers.  Not sure if it was the cipro alone or the combination but nausea was the main symptom.  I would be fine for a few hours after the Flagyl but within an hour of taking the cipro I would have to lay down due to nausea and exhaustion.  Still taking it and counting the days.
