2,Folic Acid,Folic Acid Deficiency,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 16, 2017",19,"Over the counter folic acid can sometimes make depression, related to common folate abnormalities, worse!! Or do nothing at all.  Usually, Deplin or another prescription folate is required. ---Insurance companies still won't pay for the prescription versions, saying that over the counter is basically the same!?----It is not.  This needs to change!!  The non-prescription folic acid CAN be helpful for pregnant women. ---It is useless for my condition as my body can't convert it into what I need.",Seeker28
3,Folic Acid,Folic Acid Deficiency,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 4, 2017",28,"I have some genetic defects pertaining to folate and I read people have had some success with methyfolate so I thought it might help with some of my issues (Depression/anxiety/ADD-PI ). I tried it as a individual vitamin and it made my brain fog worse, and I developed a feeling of being somewhere between tired/fatigued and agitated. I tried lowering the dose but it didn't help. However, for some reason, I have no issues with it intertwined with other vitamins/minerals in a whole food multivitamin....it seems very strange to me, but whatever works.",RjoyD
