0,2 in 1 Dandruff Topical,Dandruff,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 5, 2020",2,"I get a lot of zinc in my diet due to eating garlic or onions with legumes. So possibly as a result, I'm one that had a reaction to using a conditioner with the chemical at 0.5%. Maybe a half hour or after I used it, skin would start oozing liquid, and would keep going until it dried up and made an awful flaky mess. It caused normal winter low dandruff into shedding flakes constantly. Taking about a month to clear up after use, having heavy flaking the whole while, while skin heals from the irritation. If you use the product in the shower and some skin on your body starts to ooze liquid, discontinue use. Anywhere where the product flows can be aggravated, and you can have heavy wetness and crusting that's a pain to live with. There are parts on your body that will likely have an adverse reaction before your scalp does. So skin wetness is the first warning sign I wish I knew immediately, was because of the product for my scalp.",Healthy plant eater
1,2 in 1 Dandruff Topical,Dandruff,9.0,,"February 6, 2014",6,"I grabbed a ""Fresh Mint"" bottle by Top Care in the store because it looks similar to Head & Shoulders.If you have ever used Burt's Bees lip balm, and liked the feel of that, just think:  this stuff is like Burt's Bees on your head!Long story short, even without any scalp condition, I have found that this is invigorating. Definitely try it.",The Finisher

I tried rinsing and rinsing a,but it was so hard to get my eye open. Once I took out my contact lense, the burning intensified. I went to bed that evening and awoke 2 hours later with severe pain,eye was swollen and closed shut with puss. I went to the emergency room & was told I had a chemical burn.",AFRIENDSHA
