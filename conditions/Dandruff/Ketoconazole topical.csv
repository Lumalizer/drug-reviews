0,Ketoconazole topical,Dandruff,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 5, 2021",1,I never knew my dandruff will go away until my pharmacist suggested I use ketoderm gel. Less than a month no more flaking and itching. Please if a ketoderm hair oil could come up that would be super great. The hair gets too dry after shampooing.,Anonymous
1,Ketoconazole topical,Dandruff,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 25, 2020",16,I absolutely recommend this ketoconazole shampoo for anybody struggling with dandruff. Honestly I was struggling getting out of the house I didn't wanna go out cause my dandruff got to be so bad. And I already struggle with bad anxiety. I do not like being out in public. So I got sick of my itchy scalp and dandruff and finally looked up a good dermatologist around my area. So I was asking my doctor for a referral and she actually recommended this shampoo to me. She told me how good it is. And so I gave it a try and already second day of using this I can see a huge improvement of my hair. No more dandruff or itchy scalp!! I am so shocked by this. I have tried so many dandruff shampoos and none of them ever worked for me. But this right here is a miracle!! I just recommend using a good moisturizing conditioner with it as it was a little drying to me. But other than that I Highly recommend this!:),Nick

3,Ketoconazole topical,Dandruff,9,,"March 11, 2018",21,"Nizoral Shampoo (ketoconazole):I'm from UK.I suffer with dandruff every time I'm going through a stressful time. I tried many products and shampoos with little success. FinaIly I tried Nizoral shampoo which is an anti fungal preparation for dandruff. It worked brilliantly. That's when I realised my stress- induced dandruff flare- ups were caused by a fungus. Presumably, the stress was affecting my immune system and therefore I was getting an over- growth of the fungus on my scalp, every time I was going through a stressful period. The nizoral kills the fungus and the dandruff goes away until I go through a period of stress again when the dandruff comes back. But I use Nizoral again and away the dandruff goes again.Of course, the nizoral deals with the symptoms (i.e. dandruff) and not the cause (i.e. stress) but hey, it works on the dandruff so it does the job it's meant to do. The only down side, I find it a bit expensive for such a tiny bottle of shampoo.",Lilly Hill
4,Ketoconazole topical,Dandruff,5,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 14, 2017",13,Nizoral Shampoo (ketoconazole):I used Nizoral for about 8 years.  It was excellent for eliminating dandruff which was a bad problem.  But about one year ago I started having severe itching on my upper back and upper front (chest) area.  It was complete itching so severe that benadryl ointment (over the counter) for poison ivy relief and similar products were needed to calm the itchiness.  Crazy itchiness!  My dermatologist gave me steroid creams for the itching and I requested a biopsy to find out more.  Inflammation showed.  I decided to quit using Nizoral and finally the itching went away mostly.  I use baby shampoo now followed by Head and Shoulders shampoo.  So far so good.  Be warned that you might develop an allergy to Nizoral or the generic years later.,luckyladysmom
5,Ketoconazole topical,Dandruff,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 14, 2017",4,"I used this shampoo and cream for 2 years now , what a great job it does for my face and my scalp ! My only problem is I have very long hair so they need to make bigger bottles because it takes a little more to get to my scalp ! As for the cream on my face it worked great at first but now I can tell it's not working as good but it still helps.Great product !",Ricki lynn

7,Ketoconazole topical,Dandruff,10,,"April 25, 2015",33,"Nizoral A-D (ketoconazole):I have been struggling with severe dandruff for a little over 2 years and I have tried everything. From head and shoulders to selsun blue to even going to the dermatologist for a long time. Nothing worked. I finally stopped going to the dermatologist because they didn't help me. I found reviews on nizoral and decided to try it. I've only used it twice now and it's already pretty much gone. Flaking is gone, itching is gone and I love it. I highly recommend it to anyone out there who is struggling with dandruff/scalp problems! It works miracles!",Anonymous
