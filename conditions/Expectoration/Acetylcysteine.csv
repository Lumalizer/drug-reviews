0,Acetylcysteine,Expectoration,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 21, 2022",0,"I am a recovering lung cancer survivor with COPD, GERD, TBM and severe eosinophilia asthma. I was given vials for inhalation to clear the mucus from my lungs. After using this one time I became acutely ill and unable to breath. I cannot stop coughing and I feel so heavy in my chest I can’t even breath. I don’t understand how this could happen but I need medical assistance after 2 days of this I feel like I could be the end of me. Going to ER.",Noddy5280

2,Acetylcysteine,Expectoration,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 3, 2021",9,Acetylcysteine in the form of ACC200 has been very important in my recovery from COVID19. The chest X-Ray during hospitalization showed quite a lot of covid damage to the lungs. I have been taking 1x ACC200 x tid. It has definitely helped to clear my lungs of mucous. I am very grateful to have the benefits of acetylcysteine in my long road to recovery from a terrible case of Covid19.,Polly

Today I am taking the Acetylcysteine  200 mg tablets  lemon flavor called Reolin 3 times a day. It is made in Germany and I got it in Israel.

It works great for me loosening up my phlegm. The only issue with it here in Delaware County, Pennsylvania is that not one Pharmacy can obtain it. There is a shortage.",Franky
5,Acetylcysteine,Expectoration,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 14, 2019",18,I purchased acetylcysteine over the counter from a pharmacy in Barcelona Spain in December 2018. I had chronic bronchitis that was aggravated by a cold or respiratory condition. This miracle drug stopped my coughing soon after taking it. Now in 2019 I have chronic bronchitis and it is the only thing that clears up my coughing and makes me feel better too. I don't understand why they discontinued it in the U.S. when you can purchase it all over Europe.,JS

Got a sinus infection, my pulmonologist could not believe my breathing remained clear. Diagnosed 2 years ago, for me that best thing yet.

9,Acetylcysteine,Expectoration,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 12, 2017",16,"Personally, taking 600mg. orally bid (or tid if symptomatic) for allergic bronchitis has reduced overall severity of seasonal exacerbations.  Have recommended it to others with chronic sinus or respiratory conditions where it's indicated, and most of the time, reports are very favorable.  A safe older drug that is largely neglected in the U.S.  Recent trial in China showed decreased hospitalizations in persons with COPD who are maintained on N-acetylcysteine.",Avid Reader
10,Acetylcysteine,Expectoration,10.0,,"January 10, 2016",10,my mother was taking this drug at 10% with her nebulizer treatment of 3ml albuterol bronchodilator and it was working well. But now hospice has sent the 20% for her to use and it is NOT breaking up the mucus as well. They say that the drug is on backorder for the 10% and she is suffering by what seems to be by using the 20%. I was told by a pulminologist that it must be diluted with a bronchodilator  which is the albuterol but in switching to the 20% I'm not sure what the mixture should be.,juliescolors
11,Acetylcysteine,Expectoration,1.0,,"June 14, 2015",40,"Mucomyst (acetylcysteine):As a heathcare professional having given Mucomyst to patients over more than 30 year career, I've yet to observe any benefit from the aerosolization of this med. I don't want to minimize the previous comments. Used during a bronchoscopy in liquid wash, it will dissolve thick mucus quickly and effectively but the benefit of aerosolization has not been demonstrated or established in any controlled study. Also, after more than 24 hours of use, the lung tissue will begin to ""weep,"" this is a very caustic substance to lung. Too often it's order for a specific problem area of the lung. As the laws of nature take effect in that gas follows the path of least resistance, Mucomyst is delivered to all areas of lung with minimal effect to the problem.",Anonymous

13,Acetylcysteine,Expectoration,10.0,,"November 7, 2013",33,"I had severe bronchitis while traveling in the south of France this summer and had an excellent experience with the French socialized health system.  A local doctor in a small village in Provence prescribed Exomuc (an orange flavored granular form of Acetylcysteine made to be taken orally when dissolved in a small glass of water).  My cough was gone within 48 hours!  Why is this not a commonly prescribed drug in the US?  I normally take steroids, decongestants and cough formulas for 1-2 weeks in the U.S.!",Relief-in-Provence

It was causing me severe pulmonary distress.  I was taking my rescue inhaler every 2 hours.  The doctor in Hungary prescribed acetylcysteine, to help clear the lungs.  My lungs cleared in days.  What a difference!  The only side effect I had was dripping from my nose.  It liquified the mucus there too.  Usually back home in the US they prescribe steroids (prednisone) and albuterol nebulizer treatments for weeks while the coughing clears.  No more for me.",TLD - California

My bronchitis disappeared. My FEV1 increased 25 per cent. My sinus condition cleared up and the headaches were gone.

16,Acetylcysteine,Expectoration,10.0,,"June 24, 2011",38,"It helped my asthma a lot, diminishing the cough quite a lot. I didn't get any bronchospasm from it despite the warnings, however some itching appeared but soon went away. Before my asthma was under control it also helped a lot by making the mucus much easier to cough up. It works very well every single day (if a stop taking it the coughing soon enough increases).",the_chemist
17,Acetylcysteine,Expectoration,10.0,,"November 12, 2009",40,"When I came down with pneumonia while living in Israel, acetylcysteine (brand name Siran) made all of the difference.  The medicine came as effervescent tablets with a lemon flavoring taken with water four times a day.  Within 48 hours I could feel a world of difference as I started to purge all of the fluid and congestion from my lungs.  Siran is one of the most effective medicines for expectoration I have ever used.",Anonymous
