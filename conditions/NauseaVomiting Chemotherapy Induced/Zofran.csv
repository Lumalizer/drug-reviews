1,Zofran,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 13, 2020",9,"I went through pure nightmare during chemo for my Triple Negative BC in 2015.  Nausea is an understatement.  My oncologist told me that I was the worst patient she ever had with nausea.  This is a woman who was practicing in the 70's when they still treated with mercury.  I cannot tell you how many nausea medications I was prescribed.  Zofran was by far the BEST medication at relieving my symptoms.  5 years later I still cannot 'handle' any kind of nausea.  I have an 'emergency' prescription that I have with me 24/7.  I only need it maybe twice a year, but it is still the Magic Bullet that relieves any nausea/vomiting I may have.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MEDICATION!!!",swinlin
2,Zofran,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 3, 2018",10,"I'm one of those people that would rather be in pain than nauseous, so when I started chemotherapy I knew I was in for a ride. I was given a cocktail of meds right before chemo and then Decadron and Zofran for a couple of days after for allergic reaction and nausea. For the times after that ""as needed"" I have Zofran & Compazine for nausea and Ativan for ""anticipatory nausea"". I guess the Ativan would help some commenters in this thread who actually get sick from thinking about getting sick. It made me too drowsy so I was left with the Compazine and Zofran. I found the Zofran to be by far the most effective; I take one 4mg tablet as soon as I start feeling queasy and within 10-15 minutes I am fine - I'm even able to eat. Thankfully my insurance covers it as it is a little more expensive than some meds for nausea but to me it's worth not vomiting. I recommend this medication highly.",NormT
3,Zofran,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 1, 2016",8,"Could not tolerate this drug during chemo rxHated it prescribed for thee cycles of my red  devil chemo treatmentIt caused paranoia constipation which caused increased vomiting and also probably added to the chemonesia issues Zophran Was replaced by Emend and i had 180 degree different drug and had no issues whatsoeverZophran interferes with serotonin in the brain",Susan from NC
4,Zofran,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,8,,"May 1, 2016",13,"I had a very long treatment time, 3Xweek, 2 8 hr. sessions with three types of chemo   radiation.  It was every 3rd week, Wed, Thur, & Fri. Wed/Thur were 8 hr. sessions, Fri, 4 hrs.  I was constantly vomiting, morning, noon and night.  I took this from the get go, but after about my 2nd session, I threw up a lot in the mornings, or if I coughed too hard even.  I know it would have been SO much worse without the Zofran. I think with the amount of treatment I had, both chemo and radiation, to both my chest and to my brain that I was VERY lucky I wasn't more sick, and frankly, I'm lucky to be here at all. Thank you  Cancer Treatment center and of course, thank you God!",Zofran saved me during cancer.
5,Zofran,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,5,,"December 7, 2015",5,"Sadly, oral Zofran (or at least the generic of it) was not enough to combat my nausea while on GDP. However intravenous zofran along with hydration did help.",Trish one of many
6,Zofran,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 5, 2014",19,"Going through chemotherapy for ALL for 3 years, and I've tried EVERY available CNIV that I could get when I was doing my chemotherapy. Zofran by far was the best for me specifically the sublingual (melt under the tongue) it also has a cherry taste to it and the taste of it gives me an almost instantaneously feeling of the symptoms being not as bad and then as it finally melts it greatly reduces the symptom if not completely stops them. Sometimes unfortunately there's times that even though it reduced symptoms that the CNIV was just stronger and I'd still not feel to well and still have CNIV but it did at least help and make it more tolerable when it didn't completely take it away.",DaMaFia6iX

8,Zofran,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 21, 2012",16,"Overall, it has been the best anti-emetic available for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. The downfall is gastric slowdown-- which can become more pronounced if on vinca alkaloid chemo or opioids.",Anonymous
9,Zofran,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,10,,"March 16, 2010",57,"My Mother was diagnosed with Ovarian cancer and had to undergo months of chemotherapy which caused her to be severely sick (she was 69 at the time of diagnosis).  The medication for sickness that the hospital gave her didn't work, and she still vomited and felt drained etc from both the vomiting and the chemotherapy.  I went to my GP (I'm English) and asked him if there was anything which he could prescribed to help her as it was terrible seeing her going through this, and he prescribed Zofran.  I cannot praise this medication enough, within moments of her taking it, her sickness subsided and she continued through her chemotherapy taking only the Zofram and she was never sick again!!",Anonymous
