0,Gabapentin,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,1,,"December 23, 2016",4,I had a very horrible experience with this medicine. I was prescribed 900 mg for tingling and numbness in hands. I was good with this medicine for a few days when I started to have horrible back and neck pain and severe headache. Other doctors did prescribe me other pain killing medicines but nothing worked. I had it for fifteen days when a doctor said to consult with a neurologist . Then the neurologist said that I should be admitted into the hospital since they had found an infection in me.  I was in there  for at least one and a half week . It was a horrible experiance.,Neetu1234567865
