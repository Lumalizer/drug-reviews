1,Lorazepam,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 21, 2012",13,"Thank you for this medicine when chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting gets to its worst. It acts quickly and sedates me well. It is also good to have on hand when undergoing invasive medical procedures, I take about 90 minutes prior. Don't get hooked because it will stop working for you. If you need this for nausea, rely on it as a fallback medicine when Zofran does not work.",hat_hat
