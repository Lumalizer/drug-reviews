0,Dexamethasone,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 4, 2022",0,"I’m given 8mg IV Dexamethasone prior to Chemo. You are then prescribed Dexamethasone 4mg orally breakfast and lunchtime post chemo for 3 days. The first time i took it I thought I was losing my head - the headache was mind blowing unrelieved by Paracetamol. Never again, I’ll put up with the nausea. My weight also ballooned and I couldn’t stop eating. Dreadful stuff!!",SailorGirl
1,Dexamethasone,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 3, 2017",6,"I receive this drug with chemo and am supposed to take it days 2-4 afterwards. Other than anxiety it does the trick of improving abdominal pain but once I stop I am in agony. Burning pain and cramps, indigestion, back pain and decreased urine output. I'm ready to give up on the whole thing.",Lizzie5
2,Dexamethasone,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 9, 2016",9,This steroid nearly killed me. Receiving as part of my chemo took 2 a day for 3 days straight after chemo. Was only on them for three months when they induced diabetic ketoacidosis. Was on life support for 10 days. Will never touch a steroid again. I have given this a high score on the bar because it did stop me feeling sick,Maggie Gallo

5,Dexamethasone,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,10,,"December 29, 2014",13,"When I started chemo again for the third time, I was surprised that I had a lot more issues with nausea and loss of appetite, and also fatigue, then I did the other chemos. The previous times I only had 2 days of loss of appetite. Now I was experiencing 4 - 5 days of stomach upset, acid reflux and extreme fatigue. My chemo is Carboplatin  and Gemzar. I tried other nausea medicines that weren't very effective, or made me very drowsy. The Dexamethasone 4mg dose -1 pill in the morning, did the trick. My doctor also gave me a pill for indigestion. I could eat anything, and wasn't tired. I know I can't stay on it for very long, but I hope it will be OK for the next 9 weeks I have left of Chemo.",Lindylouwho32
6,Dexamethasone,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,9,,"April 18, 2012",31,"I had tried Zofran and Ativan, to no avail.  I had dreadful vomiting and nausea from the chemotherapy, and was losing weight as everything I ate came back up again.  But once I was prescribed the dexamethasone, I was able to get both the nausea and vomiting under control, and start eating again.  It worked well for me!",StillMe
