0,Metoclopramide,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 26, 2019",9,"I take 10 mg of metonia (generic) before chemo and whenever I feel a twinge of nausea starting and it works excellently! I'm on an 8-week cycle (7 on, 1 off) for pancreatic cancer which can't be cured but the tumour can stay status quo for a while with chemo so the metonia is a godsend. I'll be doing chemo until it doesn't work anymore so this drug is my best friend (with no unwanted side effects)! Good luck to all out there!",nancy
1,Metoclopramide,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 15, 2017",5,I was going to my family doctor for heartburn and try to every prescription in the book for my indigestion come to find out I had Hodgkin's lymphoma cancer. Then when taking chemo I was getting nauseated and still had the indigestion even worse my hematologist put me on this drug and I praise it to this day it's the best thing out there. I am currently in remission but still side effects from the cancer and chemo so I have indigestion problems and as long as I take it before meals and before bedtime I no longer have indigestion,Sean McCoy
