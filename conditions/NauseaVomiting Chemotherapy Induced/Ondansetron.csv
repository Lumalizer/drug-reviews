1,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 13, 2021",0,"I was prescribed ondansetron for vomiting associated with a mystery virus/food poisoning that caused painful stomach and bowel cramping—-then vomiting. Prior to the medication, I was unable to eat anything. With the med, I was able to eat bland food.  I only needed it to get through whatever weird virus/food poisoning that I had (about four days). I had none of the other side effects described in other folks’ reviews, but I was not taking this for cancer treatment, so that is probably why.  I found this drug to be very helpful.",Cleopatra
2,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 29, 2021",0,"Had Chemo for breast cancer.  Very effective drug, took care of my nausea immediately for the whole day.  Down side is that it was very constipating for me.  I already am chronically constipated and this drug made it worst.  Had to take laxative to keep myself going.",Marilyn
3,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 13, 2020",9,"Zofran (ondansetron):I went through pure nightmare during chemo for my Triple Negative BC in 2015.  Nausea is an understatement.  My oncologist told me that I was the worst patient she ever had with nausea.  This is a woman who was practicing in the 70's when they still treated with mercury.  I cannot tell you how many nausea medications I was prescribed.  Zofran was by far the BEST medication at relieving my symptoms.  5 years later I still cannot 'handle' any kind of nausea.  I have an 'emergency' prescription that I have with me 24/7.  I only need it maybe twice a year, but it is still the Magic Bullet that relieves any nausea/vomiting I may have.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MEDICATION!!!",swinlin
4,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 31, 2019",2,Horrible drug. Been on chemo and this was my 4th cycle and you can have a severe reaction to ondansetron. I thought I was going to b the end of me. Apparently you can get sensitive to this medicine as time goes by. Thank fully I'm here to tell the story. This drug should be taken very carefully by doctors. Next time for my chemo I expect no ondasentron for me!,Maddoxmed

6,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 8, 2019",4,"Zofran ODT (ondansetron):The brand Zofran worked perfect. Generics (Mylan, Rising, Glenmark) began coming out 2 years later. These made sicker & caused headaches. Zofran contains .03 mg aspartame. Generics have .51 mg.  Naturally insurance won't cover Zofran. I'm just glad I got it when I first started chemo when sickest.",lw
7,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 3, 2018",10,"Zofran (ondansetron):I'm one of those people that would rather be in pain than nauseous, so when I started chemotherapy I knew I was in for a ride. I was given a cocktail of meds right before chemo and then Decadron and Zofran for a couple of days after for allergic reaction and nausea. For the times after that ""as needed"" I have Zofran & Compazine for nausea and Ativan for ""anticipatory nausea"". I guess the Ativan would help some commenters in this thread who actually get sick from thinking about getting sick. It made me too drowsy so I was left with the Compazine and Zofran. I found the Zofran to be by far the most effective; I take one 4mg tablet as soon as I start feeling queasy and within 10-15 minutes I am fine - I'm even able to eat. Thankfully my insurance covers it as it is a little more expensive than some meds for nausea but to me it's worth not vomiting. I recommend this medication highly.",NormT

9,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,8.0,,"May 1, 2016",13,"Zofran (ondansetron):I had a very long treatment time, 3Xweek, 2 8 hr. sessions with three types of chemo   radiation.  It was every 3rd week, Wed, Thur, & Fri. Wed/Thur were 8 hr. sessions, Fri, 4 hrs.  I was constantly vomiting, morning, noon and night.  I took this from the get go, but after about my 2nd session, I threw up a lot in the mornings, or if I coughed too hard even.  I know it would have been SO much worse without the Zofran. I think with the amount of treatment I had, both chemo and radiation, to both my chest and to my brain that I was VERY lucky I wasn't more sick, and frankly, I'm lucky to be here at all. Thank you  Cancer Treatment center and of course, thank you God!",Zofran saved me during cancer.

12,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 5, 2014",19,"Zofran (ondansetron):Going through chemotherapy for ALL for 3 years, and I've tried EVERY available CNIV that I could get when I was doing my chemotherapy. Zofran by far was the best for me specifically the sublingual (melt under the tongue) it also has a cherry taste to it and the taste of it gives me an almost instantaneously feeling of the symptoms being not as bad and then as it finally melts it greatly reduces the symptom if not completely stops them. Sometimes unfortunately there's times that even though it reduced symptoms that the CNIV was just stronger and I'd still not feel to well and still have CNIV but it did at least help and make it more tolerable when it didn't completely take it away.",DaMaFia6iX

The downfall is gastric slowdown-- which can become more pronounced if on vinca alkaloid chemo or opioids.",Anonymous
15,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,10.0,,"March 16, 2010",57,"Zofran (ondansetron):My Mother was diagnosed with Ovarian cancer and had to undergo months of chemotherapy which caused her to be severely sick (she was 69 at the time of diagnosis).  The medication for sickness that the hospital gave her didn't work, and she still vomited and felt drained etc from both the vomiting and the chemotherapy.  I went to my GP (I'm English) and asked him if there was anything which he could prescribed to help her as it was terrible seeing her going through this, and he prescribed Zofran.  I cannot praise this medication enough, within moments of her taking it, her sickness subsided and she continued through her chemotherapy taking only the Zofram and she was never sick again!!",Anonymous
16,Ondansetron,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,10.0,,"July 21, 2008",23,My mum started taking Zofran when she was on Folfox-4 Protocol (5-FU and Oxaliplatin) for the treatment of Stage IV colorectal cancer. Zofran was instrumental in removing the nausea and vomiting side effects that usually accompanies this treatment. Mum rarely had any vomiting or nausea attacks while she was using Zofran. The only side effect was slight chapping on the lips which was easily treated by using topical creams.,omaralim
