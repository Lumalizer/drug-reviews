0,Olanzapine,NauseaVomiting Chemotherapy Induced,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2022",0,"I’ve been having unexplainable nausea for six months now. I’ve seen my GP, several gastroenterologists, neurologist and psychiatrist. I wanted to rule out anxiety disorder and the doctor agreed it wasn’t anxiety. I was diagnosed with SIBO. Apparently my GI believes the nausea can be caused by SIBO. Olanzapine has worked wonders for me!! I tried reglan, compazine and zofran with little to no relief. The nausea has subsided and I can now eat! From a scale of 1-10, 10 being terrible. The nausea is at a one and at times I don’t feel nauseated at all. It’s definitely worth a try.",Alexa
