0,Effexor XR,Social Anxiety Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 19, 2021",1,"My social anxiety resolves around me feeling inept, boring, awkward, annoying & straight up unlikeable. Also resolves around me feeling judged harshly by others. It ruins social situations. Situations I experience this are around strangers, answering the door/phone, meeting new people, hanging out, shopping, school, the list goes on. I've been on Venlafaxine XR for depression and social anxiety since late July and it’s helped give my my emotions back so I feel less boring but I still overthink a ton, albeit less. My anxious thoughts are somewhat suppressed but they’re still there. It’s been helpful for depression but for social anxiety I feel maybe an increased dosage to 225 would benefit me since I feel it working just not enough.",Joey
1,Effexor XR,Social Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 5, 2021",29,Effexor has absolutely changed my life for the better.  It's massively helped with my social anxiety.

2,Effexor XR,Social Anxiety Disorder,10.0,,"November 24, 2020",25,"Literally, I was having a meltdown. Until I sought help, and this angel of a woman prescribed me with mirtazapine + Effexor combo  ( commonly known as California Rocket Fuel) + Rivotril and my life is now changed. I feel like I haven’t felt in decades. I got my life back. I almost didn’t follow through with this because of the side effects you get in the beginning. But if you stick to it, 3 months in you’ll see for yourself! I seriously don’t give a damn if I need to take this the rest of my life. Well worth it!",Oooppot
3,Effexor XR,Social Anxiety Disorder,,,"January 23, 2020",132,"This drug has been amazing for me. My NP first started me on Zoloft 50mg and I felt no difference and then bumped me up to 100 mg and my anxiety got super bad, which I didn’t even know was possible because I have severe social anxiety. I got prescribed 75 mg of Effexor and the side effects were really bad the first 2 weeks and I was ready to tell my NP that this wasn’t the drug for me but I gave it about 2 more weeks and noticed a HUGE difference. Before taking this when I would walk into class my heart would be beating so fast that I thought I would have a heart attack, I would be shaking so much and would feel like I can’t even walk or function at all. But with this drug I was able to walk into class calmly, no shaking, and didn’t even mind asking a question in front of the class. I never in a million years thought I would have the courage to do that. I know everybody is different but this drug really has saved my life!!",Andrea
4,Effexor XR,Social Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 20, 2019",50,"I have been using this medication for about a year now I am on 75 MGs per day and I usually take it around 6 o’clock in the evening. In the beginning I noticed a few side effects however this medication has been amazing for me. I have missed a dosage by accident and did not notice any symptoms I work really hard not to miss any dosages. I don’t think I even realized how bad my anxiety was until I started this medication I feel like a new person it is helped me a lot. However I think medication works differently for everybody, everybody’s body chemistry is different so it might react well for some and not so well for others. I think it’s important to have open communication with your doctor and to talk about negative and positive side effects you might be feeling with any medication.",Mer
5,Effexor XR,Social Anxiety Disorder,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 18, 2019",19,I've been on a few antidepressants for social anxiety disorder. It is difficult to find the right med. I think Effexor with Lamictal is a great combo.,JHJ88
6,Effexor XR,Social Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 10, 2019",45,"Bodies and brain chemistry change from person to person so try not to generalize with chemicals. In my PERSONAL experience I've experienced improvements on depression after a month on Effexor 37.5mg, then upped to 150mg. It wasn't until my dose got to 300mg which I'm right now that I'm feel a lot less anxious and capable to try small talks, eye contacts, get to the social game without feeling awkward and inept. Don't know how I'm going to come off this, maybe I won't.",Papadopaulo

8,Effexor XR,Social Anxiety Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 22, 2019",58,"I see a lot of people complaining about the withdrawal of this drug or side effects. I hope this drug never gets discontinued. This drug is the only thing (besides benzos, but try get prescribed that these days..)that has ever helped me with my major depression, social anxiety, and panic attacks. This drug is not meant for everyone .. if you have slight anxiety or depression you should not be on this drug.. yes the withdrawal is bad but for some people with severe issues we NEED this to function in society or until we are stable enough through therapy to get off. This is the only drug that works for some people like me with severe anxiety issues",Kay
9,Effexor XR,Social Anxiety Disorder,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 1, 2019",12,I've been taking 150mg of Effexor for 2 weeks. 2 weeks ago I was super depressed and afraid of everything. My symptoms are decreasing. Nothing for social anxiety so far. I suffer from severe generalised social anxiety. I'm hoping in the months to come. It may be a miracle drug for me. I've read so many good reviews on this drug for this debilitating disorder.,Wolverine
10,Effexor XR,Social Anxiety Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 22, 2019",18,"I was started on 37.5 then moved up to 75mg then 150mg  I always had brain zaps when it was just about time to take my next dose,  I also got hives when I started this drug which  I thought was bug bites.  I got really red-faced and flushed and got dizzy and nauseous on a continued basis.  This drug may work for others but not for me. I anxiety all the time.  Now I am going off of it.  I was on it for 1.5 years.  It has been living hell.  Very bad brain zaps, non stop crying, dizziness.  very unfocused.  I have had to take off three months from work because of this drug.   I am feeling so sick right now.   Best of Luck to those who take this.  They have banned the non Extended Release in Canada  so they need to take this off the market here too. It also made my heart rate go to 190bpm and had to go to the ER and given two IV treatments to slow it down. Don't take this with clarithromycin or Biaxin it can cause heart issues.",indigogirl

My initial side effects for the first three days were excessive fatigue, I think I slept for two days straight. I also had nausea and sweating. After four days the side effects stopped except the nausea still continues. My overall mental health is a lot better. I am calmer, less stressed, and able to concentrate better. I have also lost 6kg since starting the medication. So far I'm happy on it, the nausea is slowly subsiding but is still there.",Laura
12,Effexor XR,Social Anxiety Disorder,10.0,,"March 3, 2018",67,"I had anxiety for 20 years and didn't really know the reason for it. I moulded my miserable life around my anxiety demands and tried my best to change things but all gone vain. It was one good day that I saw  neuro surgeon  about another issue who prescribed me effexor alongnwith other medicines. While I was searching the uses and dosages of the medicines the word ""Social Anxiety Disorder"", for the first time, came in my knowledge. I was amazed that all symptoms and behavioral pattern that were described in this context were almost identical with my situation.  I am on effexor for six months and things are altogether changed. My relations with family, workplace, friends are quickly restored. I am very happy and really enjoying my life now.The side effects are far less important then the major damages that the disorder itself creates. Effexor works like magic spell and within days it change the life and lifestyle.",Salam Esapzo

Taking 37.5mg now in the morning and still am dealing with being very jittery at night when trying to relax or sleep. On the positive side this has been a great  in dealing with past negative issues and moving past them. Also much more relaxed in social situations and a much more positive attitude about life in general. Every day more confident and things seem a little better,R.carpenter

15,Effexor XR,Social Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 12, 2017",60,"After years of Social Anxiety/Panic attacks I had to sort myself out. I did some research into SNRIs/SSRIs and like many, was fearful of the side effects described by others and how bad it made people feel.I went to the GP who prescribed Venlafaxine/Effexor.The first few weeks I felt a little nausea, increased anxiety/panic attacks, delay in ejaculation. It never felt unmanageable. After 6 weeks all had gone.I feel 80% less anxious in social/all situations, I feel calm and very much unphased by most things. I feel more confident, my mind is clearer and it is physically impossible to dwell on negative thoughts. Haven't had a panic attack!Everyone reacts differently.

18,Effexor XR,Social Anxiety Disorder,2.0,,"November 2, 2016",21,"The first two months of Effexor Xr 37 mg were great, I felt good. But that apparently is just the start up. The first couple days of taking it I felt an awesome  euphoria and a high like I was on cocaine.  I was a little restless,  had a hard time getting to sleep, had  diarrhea . The doctor bumped me up to 75 mg one week ago, the first day was awesome I felt like I was on cocaine again. after that first day I felt nothing  other than an overbearing fact that I wanted to get off of the shit. I feel like complete trash.  I feel emotionless but reaally down  I don't know if I can make it another week on this medication . I've been on 4medications and none of them have help so far.
