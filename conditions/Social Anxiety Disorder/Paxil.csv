0,Paxil,Social Anxiety Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 8, 2021",0,"I was on 3 SSRI  before Paxil for social anxiety and this one worked the best I was year and a half on it but unfortunately I started to shake to much and I got black spots on my legs like someone punched me. My psychiatrist told me it was from Paxil and I got hot, burning in some areas which hurt. I had to quit paxil I was on 30mg. Now I tried to quit and my anxiety is slowly coming back. I was thinking of trying zoloft because everyone is saying that it's great. So yeah sad but I  hope I will find some drug that will work great with me.",Mayah
1,Paxil,Social Anxiety Disorder,10.0,,"July 22, 2021",4,"This drug changed my life in a positive way. I was put on (10 mg) for depression and social anxiety disorder. The only side effects were drowsiness, and it was a bit rough in the beginning as described (Restlessness, loss of appetite symptoms got worse before they got better, brain fog, etc.) But it was worth it. I can finally live my life. My brain fog diminished by a tenfold and I was able to talk to people, I was surviving in situations that would make me have a nervous breakdown only months prior. My depression lessened and I felt more happy again; I feel like I'm allowed to live again. I was scared to take this after reading all the negative experiences, but I've had not one regret after going on Paxil. I finally feel positive for the future.Paxil is different for everyone, and you need to see which medication works for you. It may be either a great or a terrible fit; you'll never know until you try it.",Daisy

3,Paxil,Social Anxiety Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 1, 2020",6,"I started taking paxil after being SSRI free for 8 months. Side effects of citalopram were worrying in the long run. My very good memory was suddenly poor and when I drank alcohol I  could barely remember the night. So I stopped the Paxil. But I could only live with my mind for 8 months. I had panic attacks at work daily and it was too much to take. I'm 25 so having social anxiety which is a nightmare. Paxil. Initial side effects of paxil were bad considering I only started on 5mg dosage ! Ringing in ears. Tingling in my arm. Constant and for weeks ! Side effects stopped and I really did feel better Until now. 3 months in. And my hair is falling out in chunks. I'M FEMALE. My hair is thick and curly and one of the only things I liked about myself. Liked, because now it is thinner by half. I googled a link between paxil and hair loss and although poorly reported I wasn't the only one that has experienced this. Pills are not a cure. This is not a cure. It's a disease.",Mm99
4,Paxil,Social Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2020",59,"I was prescribed this about 10 yrs ago and I cannot remember why I was taken off it and put on Sertraline. However since then my social anxiety has been debilitating even on the highest dose Of  sertraline.  I was thinking and trying to remember a really relaxed happy time and I remembered the paroxetine period. My whole life  since then has been gripped by fear and anxiety and fear of scrutiny I rang my Dr and asked if I could try it again. He was a bit reluctant because of the withdrawal problems but agreed. My goodness, I am SO thankful, within a week the anxiety and constant fear and tension had gone. It is amazing and I have my life back again !!! My heart is singing with joy and the release is so fantastic. THANK YOU PAXIL, I have a future !!",Anonymous
5,Paxil,Social Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 5, 2020",53,"I’ve been taking Paxil for almost a year now. I struggled with social anxiety all my life, but it was manageable. But when I started college, it got really bad. It got to the point where I couldn’t order food at a restaurant or buy a bag of chips at the gas station without feeling nauseous. My doctor thought Paxil would and put me in 20mg. And it really has made a huge difference. I can function like a normal human now. I’m not suddenly a social butterfly or anything, I’m still a rather shy person. This drug won’t change your personality, but it does help alleviate anxious symptoms associated with social situations.",MaryMac

I took Paxil as a child to help me with my anxiety, specifically social anxiety. I would have terrible stomach aches before and during school because I was so crippled with anxiety. I had a few friends, but never made an attempt to meet anyone new. I was prescribed Paxil and my life made a 180! I became very social and made a lot of friends very fast. I loved the life I was having! The downside and ultimately why I stopped was because I didn't have a care in the world and the hurt my schooling. I started to get behind on homework which hurt my grades.",B

9,Paxil,Social Anxiety Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 6, 2020",12,"My life is a little bit more complicated than just anxiety and depression. Paxil is good for depression and anxiety - I suppose, but it doesn't work by itself for me. Twenty years ago, my psychiatrist prescribed Paxil, but I continued to have intense anxiety in social situations as well as paranoia - no hallucinations; just delusional thinking which I THOUGHT was part of panic disorder. I'm trying Paxil again, but starting at lower dose due to ED. Currently, I take Lamictal, Klonopin, Paxil, Wellbutrin XL & Trazodone for sleep. Remember, if you don't get your anxiety under control, it will lead to social anxiety then agoraphobia and finally psychosis. Don't play around.",JC65

No sex drive at all, still anxiety but a few weeks ago I had forgotten to take for about 4 days, cried uncontrollably until I realized.

12,Paxil,Social Anxiety Disorder,10.0,,"August 1, 2019",107,"Paxil has been life-changing. I've suffered crippling social anxiety for as long as I can remember. I've been on all kinds of combinations of SSRI's from age 16 to about 25. After a couple years on nothing, I decided to give it another try. My doctor put me on Paxil. I started on 10mg for two weeks, then upped it to 20mg for a two weeks then 30mg and 40mg.  After a couple weeks on 40mg I was starting to give up hope. After about 12 weeks, I decided it didn't work and was ready to stop usage. I knew the withdrawals were pure hell, so I wanted to taper off very slowly, then one night I woke up and had this incredible sense of well-being. It was like all my anxiety and depression had suddenly disappeared. Since that moment all my anxiety has been gone. I have no idea why it took 3 months before I noticed anything, but when I did, it was profound. The drug has saved my life. I'm so glad I didn't stop before that 12 week mark. I would have never known the miracle this med has given me.",TJ

From feeling more positive to my thoughts being less overwhelming and much more easy to ignore. Especially in times in the winter (when my anxiety is much worse) it has helped to take the edge off.

I am petrified of social situations and I'm always 'nervy' & everything bothers me...literally everything!  Very easily annoyed & very easily stressed out, which is all part of anxiety.  Anyways, this medicine has worked wonders for me so far.  I can actually walk through the halls at uni without feeling the terror.  No panic attacks or flu-like symptoms afterwards anymore.

21,Paxil,Social Anxiety Disorder,,,"July 26, 2017",65,I've always had social anxiety but manageable as I would avoid social situations and worked independently for the most part. I was promoted to a management role and things started getting out of control. I couldn't speak to anymore for any longer than 10 minutes. I would shake uncontrollably and have panic attacks. I thought I would have to quit the dream job I worked towards my whole life. I spoke to my doctor and she put me on Paxil. I'm at 37 mg for 7 weeks now and my life has changed. I can hold meetings within my team. I can speak without having panic attacks. I love this drug. It has saved me from losing my job and my social life.,tazly

23,Paxil,Social Anxiety Disorder,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 24, 2017",19,"I started this for anxiety and depression, mostly social anxiety. It definitely helped with my social anxiety but not in a good way. I swear it caused a personality change. I went from being terrified of talking around people to randomly blurting out weird stuff in class and being squirrelly and hyper. I went from this quiet shy girl to being kind of whacko. I started getting in trouble in class for being disruptive. I was regularly displaying behavior that was inappropriate in public. Weirdest thing ever.

25,Paxil,Social Anxiety Disorder,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 24, 2017",21,"Paxil definitely works for social anxiety. However, the side effects just became intolerable over time. What are those side effects? Well, for one, you will be tired all the time. Secondly, I found it really hard to focus, and I would forget things that just happened. Thirdly, and most disturbingly, I became a zombie who didn't care about anything and couldn't empathize with people!! I couldn't feel any emotions; I couldn't cry. Not only that, but it was also hard to experience positive emotions/pleasure. This phenomenon is called ""emotional bluntness"". I didn't notice that I was experiencing this emotional numbness (and most others don't notice too) until people around me started pointing it out. That's just my experience.",J-Gar
26,Paxil,Social Anxiety Disorder,9.0,,"March 5, 2017",30,"I was very hesitant to take medication as I had been raised to associate it with seriously mentally ill people in a negative way. Social anxiety had extreme physiological effects on me, though, that therapy could not fix, i.e. the inability to speak loudly over loud noises or when out somewhere like a club, and premature ejaculation. Paxil basically fixed this immediately. Paxil makes it so much easier to silence negative thoughts automatically. I was and am on a very low dose (10mg) and it works so well. It really did change my life. The only negative side effects are that it makes me sleepy. It also gave me a weird sensation in my teeth for the first month or so, but I actually enjoyed that feeling.",JG696

I have tried at least 100 different supplements and anti anxiety treatments.....I have tried them all...believe me.....it is hell on earth when you can't provide for your family. I even spent $4000 having all my mercury fillings removed. I had genetic testing of SNP polymorphism's that revealed MTHFR and MAO mutations.I found a genetic reason for my anxiety. In short I can't make neurotransmitters and when I do I can't break them down so they build up causing social anxiety.,Jubaea

There are times when you have NO social anxiety, for instance, in my case, even after stopping 25mg CR version Paxil, there had been no fear of social confrontation, just shyness or may be low self-esteem or introversion.But when SA attacks again, its a very gradual process. Even if you notice a slight sign of SA coming back, you try to disprove your own opinion by thinking - ''Now I have learned, this feeling is just stupid, doesn't make sense and I am definitely not gonna develop a full fledged SA.""But when SA comes back you have no idea but to start taking Paxil again.",DeepanshuGupta_India

I've never had issues with weight. I've always had trouble GAINING weight. I didn't want to gain this much. No change in my exercise routine or eating habits.

I was quiet tired in the beginning but it got better. I felt the side effects as I gained over 10kg in the past 1.5, and also I didn't have much of a sex drive and almost impossible to orgasm (I'm Male). Regardless though it helped my life for the better. Unfortunately stopping recently was a bad idea, my anxiety has returned along with a certain feel of depression.

On the inside however I'm filled with self doubt, negative thoughts, jealousy of naturally confident people etc. It also made me (careless) not give a damn about socializing so I'm less interested in social situations = more isolated = fear people's views of me.

51,Paxil,Social Anxiety Disorder,8.0,,"October 26, 2014",76,I have been depressed with major social anxiety for over five years. I've always been scared to try any medication. Lately it's been unbearable. I have too much social anxiety that I can't even sit through job interviews or simple things like going shopping alone. I'm 25 and have been on Paxil for less than a month. The first two weeks were bad. I'd wake up at odd hours of the night and be wide awake. I'd feel like puking throughout the day along with being very drowsy. Don't worry. It does subside. I feel like going out more and I'm not too worried as I usually am about people judging me or looking at me. I participate in small talk with strangers. I am free to go out without worrying. I'm content.,MissJulia

Because I have two young children, I knew it was important that I gave this a go...even though I'm in early days my mind seems content. I'm still trying to get used to it though.

Going out in public would depress me, I constantly thought people were plotting against me and talking about me. I have been on Paxil for about a month. Thank God. My work days are MUCH better, I don't analyze the hell out of everything and I'm not afraid of people. I can now get out of bed and look forward to the day, not dread it.",Anonymous
54,Paxil,Social Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 3, 2014",24,"To the person who recommended NeoCitran, do not take NeoCitran if you're taking Paxil or any other SSRI, unless the form of NeoCitran doesn't contain Dextromethorphan. These two medicines have a major interaction that could cause serotonin syndrome, which is relevant to my review of Paxil.My experience with Paxil so far hasn't been the best. Side effects have been pretty bad, and as I also have ADHD, taking both Paxil and Vyvanse has lead to some serotonin syndrome-like symptoms. I got mild serotonin syndrome a few days after I started taking Paxil, because I had been taking both Paxil and Vyvanse in the morning. I find that if I take Paxil at least 12 hours after Vyvanse, the side effects are minimal and haven't had any further problems.",Anonymous

I had anxiety still, but it was controlled. Didn't care much about anything. But my anxiety was controlled. That went on for 2 years. Just over a month ago, I saw a new doctor (insurance changed and previous doctor didn't accept it). She pushed me to try Paxil. I replaced my 20mg of Celexa with 10mg of Paxil for 2 days, then went to 20mg Paxil. No issues at all. I am so happy I did it. I am a completely different person.  When I say anxiety was controlled on Celexa, I'll tell you I have NO anxiety on Paxil. I haven't thought about it at all.

It just got worse. Paxil is a good medicine for me but not sure at this point that 30 to 20 mg was a good weaning action. My social anxiety in AA has now increased due to decrease in medicine. When I look at the ""good"" Paxil has done, it far outweighs the ""bad"". Having social anxiety is something that can isolate a person. I am not perfect in that regard, but this medicine has definitely been a positive thing in my life. It's not perfect, as I have to work on myself constantly, but it has helped me!",Man 47yrs old

I have tried Zoloft also, but it did not work near as well as Paxil does for me. Since taking Paxil, I have been working a new job for two months. I only give it a 9 because of the minor side effects, which I have been able to find a way around anyway. If your social anxiety is so bad that it affects your ability to support yourself, I would recommend Paxil. I am on 20mg. When I was taking 30mg the side effects were enough to make me switch to Zoloft for a while, but 20mg of Paxil is working great for me.",working lady

Paxil helped immediately and made me way more sociable than ever before. I had confidence to say what I wanted to say and clearer thoughts than I've ever had. I've now been off for 4 months and am struggling again with the same issues. I've tried turning to herbal remedies like rhodiola, St johns wort, 5-HTP, and fish oil. Together they make me feel alright I guess but it's just not the same.

I have been taking that dosage for the past 10 years.  My social anxiety is much more manageable than it was, although I still have my moments.  I hate to increase the dosage, however, because the sexual side effects have been bad for me.  Climax is next to impossible unless conditions are perfect, and even then it is a struggle.  My sex drive is also down, possibly because of the disappointment the lack of climax creates for me and my wife.  Personally, I am happy with the results of Paxil in terms of my social anxiety, but the sexual side effects are rough.  Good luck.",Anonymous
