0,Fluvoxamine,Social Anxiety Disorder,2.0,,"April 26, 2021",3,"I've got severe anxiety (GAD, SAD, OCD, Panic Disorder) and have been taking this med for the past 4-5 months. I'm also taking this for my depression. Currently I'm taking 175mg. Since I'm not an adult it's only recommended I take up to 200mg, so I'll likely go to there with my psych's advice. To be honest, this is one of my least favourite meds (I've tried zoloft/sertraline, mirtazapine, bupropion, venlafaxine, quetiapine). Since taking this, I've noticed a sharp increase in panic attacks and over all higher levels of anxiety, and a higher need to do my compulsions. I've missed two weeks of uni and also my job which I absolutely love because of the anxiety. My parents tell me I seem even more sad, and it's even harder for me to shower and brush my teeth. Honestly, fluvoxamine just makes me feel bad, but I know it works great for others. Just goes to show everyone is different! Luckily I haven't had physical side effects like vomiting. I also take trazodone 50mg for sleep.",sarahjbrandt
1,Fluvoxamine,Social Anxiety Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 14, 2020",14,"Originally I was prescribed this for social anxiety disorder. I do feel like it helped with managing intrusive thoughts/anxious feelings when my SAD was worse, but because of therapy and perhaps the help of the med I don’t have that anymore. I struggle more with the occasional depressive episode now and I find that 100mg of this doesn’t really do much of anything for that. However, I haven’t experienced any side effects except for clenching my teeth more.",luvoxxxx

6,Fluvoxamine,Social Anxiety Disorder,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 26, 2017",11,This drug has been amazing for me. I was taking klonopin too often trying to control anxiety. This drug took a while to work - but now that it has - it has been a life saver for me. Lost some motivation with it so MD prescribed Wellbutrin for mornings to help with that side effect. Works like a charm.,Popgtw
7,Fluvoxamine,Social Anxiety Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 12, 2017",10,"I took Luvox for over a year at a low dose.  I decided that I should try being off of it, and I took a VERY long time to work my way off of it slowly, decreasing by 50 mg after a week at each step down.Even so -- I experienced something that I would call ""flashbacks"" for almost 18 months after stopping the medication.  It was the most scary thing I ever experienced, and I had no control as to when it would happen -- and it often happened at work or while driving on the commute home (I would pull over and try to get myself together, it was horrible).    Needless to say, I never want to take this drug again.  I was surprised when the MD who prescribed it said that he thought that the flashbacks were because I needed the medication.  No way.",Joypup
8,Fluvoxamine,Social Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 20, 2012",136,"Luvox CR (fluvoxamine):I was taking 300MG of this medication for almost 1 year. I stopped taking it for about 4 months because I wanted to see how I would feel being medication free. I faced withdrawal symptoms for 1-2 weeks after suddenly quitting from 300MG to nothing. The withdrawal symptoms weren't severe at all. During the time when I was on it, I had peace of mind. I can't describe the experience other than I felt so good that I have decided to start taking it once more. I suffered from Social Anxiety, OCD, and extreme depression.",Anonymous
