0,Zoloft,Social Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 25, 2022",1,"I started on 50mg, after 2 weeks I went to 75mg without telling my doctor (he was on vacation for a week). I was on that for 4 days and then I told my doctor and he said if I feel comfortable going up that I can go to 100mg so I did. After 10 days my psychiatrist said if i want I can go to 150mg. so now todays my first day on that dosage. SAD 80% better, I still feel depressed most days, it probably just needs a couple more weeks for my body to get used to it. I can’t wait to see more results. The only side effect I got was migraines first couple days after dosage updates cause I’m prone to them.",jeremy422003
1,Zoloft,Social Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 17, 2022",2,"I've been taking this medication on and off for years. It's really the only one I've found that helps with my general and social anxiety, and depression. I still suffer some dysthymia - but that's better than not being able to get out of bed. I developed social anxiety/phobia when I was around 14, but always felt 'different'. Unfortunately l am still somewhat isolated, due to avoidant habits developed over the decades... But I am able to function well at work, go shopping, go to the gym (when it's quiet!), and maintain a few friendships. I still don't feel any particular desire to socialise or seek company, but I also do not fear it as much when it becomes necessary. I have always taken 50mg. When I go off it, the old symptoms start creeping in over the course of a few months. I recognise that I could probably function even better if I increase my dosage. Increasing dosages has always seemed a bit scary, but I'm preparing to try 75mg for 8 weeks to assess the effect.",2BR02B

After that episode I started to have bad anxiety and panic attacks witch concluded with insomnia and loosing my appetite. My doctor prescribed me Zoloft 50mg .The first day I took it my anxiety was so much worse and I had panic attacks ending with me throwing up all day long. I was sure I was dying but my doctor told me to stick with it and I did .The first 3 weeks were the worse in my entire life I’ve never felt so bad  in my life and I started to read all the reviews in here and they gave me hope and I stick with it.

7,Zoloft,Social Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2021",1,"I was started on 50 mg Sertraline once a day, and the first couple of times I took it I got a bit nauseous, but it was fairly mild and disappeared pretty fast. After around just a week my social anxiety and generalized anxiety went down a lot, but I also found a lot of my other emotions like feeling motivated or happy also went down quite a bit. After more than 2 weeks it really started to work extremely well and I stopped overthinking every social situation and felt a lot more relaxed in social situations. Sadly, one side effect that has made me try to stop it was Apathy, which can be a side effect of ssri in general. Though I got pretty bad withdrawal which felt like I was sick and lightheaded and had to take it again, so you definitely want to wean off this medication.",lI-Texas-Il

11,Zoloft,Social Anxiety Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 10, 2021",3,"This is really good for Social Anxiety, and anxiety/depression all together and just kinda meh for my OCD. This is my second, almost third month I wanna say on Zoloft. At first I was finally able to sleep when I started 25mg 1x daily.  Over time I noticed most of my critical depression symptoms had improved so much to the point I was able to leave the house and drive again. Same with my anxiety, I can actually look people in the eyes when I speak without feeling shame, and I don’t always need excuses. Not saying I don’t have the obsessive thoughts, but I don’t feel hopeless anymore. Only real side effects for me would be, weird sleep cycles, appetite shifts, sweating, and erectile dysfunction would have to be my biggest drawback. But that’s okay, cause I was like a dog that hadn’t been neutered. I can still have a good time, it just takes a long time lmao.",Ranger_27

14,Zoloft,Social Anxiety Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 3, 2021",1,"I started out on 25mg of sertraline and I was met with the expected heightened anxiety, jitters and a feeling of pressure in my head. The pressure faded after about 3-4 days, and I was left with the anxiousness for the next 3 weeks. I attempted twice to up my dose to 50mg (my prescribing physician wanted me to eventually graduate to 100mg), but each time I did, I experienced massive panic attacks that would wake me from my sleep (took sertraline in the morning). I did experience some improvement in my anxiety around that time, but not enough to warrant remaining at 25mg, so I've now switched to escitalopram. My experience might be a one-off, but I'd exercise caution when starting sertraline, especially if you are already prone to panic attacks - it certainly was a frightening experience for me, and not one I'd be keen to do over again.",Jumbi

But he was always the sweetest kid around and wouldn't do or say anything to hurt anyone else's feelings or otherwise. In 2019 the doctors finally talked him into taking zoloft to help with his issues. He started on a low dose and they increased it to a high dose over a few months. My son was having severe sides effects from the zoloft and when I expressed my concerns because now my son was suicidal, very aggressive anger and having horrible impulsive reactions the doctor told him to stop taking the zoloft. Sleepless nights of watching and removing cords from the stairs because my son had such horrible thoughts that he would try to take his own life.

The downside is about a month ago I began having the issue I needed to constantly pick at everything and got my toes all infected because I couldn’t help myself- I found out that is actually one of the side effects. My doctor then moved my dosage down and I continued to take it. Now I am hallucinating all the time that my parents and talking loud outside of my door, my car is going down a hill on a flat road.

20,Zoloft,Social Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 20, 2021",11,"I fell sick during my 2nd year of college and I was in and out of the hospital. They couldn’t find what was wrong with me. The doctors kept telling me that I was just dehydrated when I knew it was more than dehydration. I couldn’t eat or even drink something as simple as water. After seeing a specialist I was diagnosed with a nervous stomach. My anxiety caused my stomach to literally stop functioning. I fell into depression and cried everyday for no reason at all. Exams, classes, and COVID all took a major toll on me. I finally decided to see a psychiatrist and she prescribed me Zoloft. Taking Zoloft was the BEST thing I could have ever done. Although the first two weeks were hard due to headaches and drowsiness, it was worth it. I finally feel like I can breathe. Honestly, stick to Zoloft. Get through the first two weeks.

My side effects were awful! Increased anxiety, excessive sweating in hands and feet, loss of appetite, diarrhea, fatigue, dizziness, insomnia, and overall panicked. I missed 2 days of work and wondered each day if it would be the day I'd start to feel better. I cut my pills in half after 5 days. I've been taking 25mg for 2 weeks. Lowering my dose helped the side effects subside. There are still times where the uneasy feeling comes over me then passes. I feel happier and relaxed but I know it takes longer for it to kick in. I'm afraid of gaining weight on it bc I've already gained 25lbs in the past 2 years. I've always been a small girl so I'm struggling with my body image. I've also noticed a difficulty being able to finish in the bedroom. Hopefully the benefits of this drug outweigh the side effects.",Kasey

My main cause of anxiety was going out to eat. I had always enjoyed going out before, but suddenly it was a cause of great anxiety. I would avoid going out if possible and going out was a crippling experience. I started taking 50mg of Zoloft, I did not feel it working so I upped it to 100mg 6 weeks later than eventually up to 150mg after 2 1/2 after starting. At 150mg and about 3 months after I started taking it my anxiety melted away. It really did give me my life back. I’m back to my old self. The first two-three weeks I took it I did feel more anxious and sick but just keep with it. Don’t be afraid to up the dosage of it isn’t work well enough for you. I suggest upping it by 25mg so that you don’t get sick when you start taking more. This is a good medicine, try it out.",22 y/o Male

I was fine for the first week and then all of a sudden I was on the verge of a panic attack.  I tried this drug because I have family who takes this drug and I figured that it would help me since it helped them due to the close genetic make up;  boy was I wrong.  My anxiety got so bad I was on the verge of going to the ER for it.  I have tried other SSRI's and not had this sort of response.  It is very puzzling, I suppose it could potentially be an allergy (I have no clue).  It's just unbelievable that the one thing that I was actually taking it for would get worse instead of marginally better.",pmillz0704
28,Zoloft,Social Anxiety Disorder,7.0,,"February 8, 2021",21,"It was a rollercoaster of misery before Zoloft finally worked. The beginning I had awful insomnia that drove me crazy. I had anxiety worse than ever before, mood swings, crying often. But I heard it gets bad before it gets good. And my doctor kept pushing me to keep going too. So I did. Month by month, and going up every 2-3 weeks it was bad until I reached 150mg it was FINALLY better but not 100% until I got to 175mg. Everytime I went up, I had bad muscle tension that I had to go get massages.Despite how hard these past 4 months have been, it was worth the reward of the peace I have in my life now. I’ve become a better person. I am no longer depressed, and anxious. I am calm and understanding and have patience. I used to be very aggressive too but not anymore. The one side effect I still have to this day is vivid nightmares, night sweats and I wake up randomly in the middle of the night. Good luck to anyone out there!

My doctor upped my dose and I have been on 200mg of Zoloft every day for a few years. It definitely helps with my anxiety but is not the best drug. I have experienced a non existent libido, inability to orgasm, and have definitely gained a few pounds. I’m currently weaning off meds all together and it has not been pleasant. My withdrawal symptoms are extremely fatigued, stomach problems, irritability, increased anxiety. All of this is expected but still uncomfortable. While taking the Zoloft my anxiety was better but I always felt apathetic. Not the worst drug for anxiety but definitely not worth the side effects for me.",Syd

When did I know it had started working? It was like a switch, from day to day. I just was this feeling that now I don't have this ""everyone is watching and judging me"".I still have it sometimes and that's why I'm in psychoterapy (which is also very helpful), but Zoloft changed my life maybe not totally, but it definitely helps but PLEASE GIVE IT SOME TIME, if something doesn't work for 2 weeks, DON'T GIVE UP and increase dosage.

So I started on 25mg and after 2 weeks I upped to the 50 mg my doc prescribed. Honestly week 3 and 4 were the worst for me because I couldn't eat and I felt so much worse with anxiety and lack of peace of mind. Because I was working from home, and others mentioned that the first month was bad. I felt like I was being pushed under emotionally. I had to do a lot of self talk like ""I am not my feelings, this will pass"" etc. I took my Zoloft at night and it seemed by evening I always felt better, but mornings were so difficult. But right at end of week four, a cloud lifted and I felt peaceful and calm.  So I appreciate others sharing their experience because that's exactly what happened to me. And I pushed through it and I'm glad I did because I feel much better. Hope that helps someone in week 3. It does get better. Hang in there.",Butterfly

Anxiety was soo much worse, feeling terrified, depressed, feeling guilt, crying, brain fog and nausea. I lost almost 8kg in 2 weeks because I couldn't eat. My Psychiatrist told me to take 0.5mg of Clonazepam till the side effects lift. After exactly 4 weeks I can say that all the side effects are gone. I feel a bit sleepy, but I am much more calm, no anxiety at all, no guilty feeling. Derealization is still here but much less, I don't care about her so she will go away with time too. I went back on work and started socalizing again. I take only 1/8 of Clonazepam. I will up my dose in a few days, but slowly. I PROMISE  you that the starting side effects will pass. Trust me!

I felt awful all of the time with headaches, nausea, dizziness, more panic and anxiety and would get fatigued in the middle of the day. I also started having tension in my neck and shoulders.  Because of these new developments, I was given Zoloft instead.  Once again, I had side effects like headaches, nausea and brain fog, but they are not as bad.  I did feel bad the first week but things are getting better.  While I still am nauseous and still don't sleep until my alarm, it isn't as bad.  I have more focus, which I didn't have prior.  I'm hoping that if I stick with this medicine, my sleep and phobia control will improve.  I have a follow up for 2 weeks from now to see if we might need to raise the dose from 50mg to 100mg.",SC

My Dr suggested Zoloft  because along with anxiety I had a lot of symptoms of PTSD. I felt it right away. I started at 25mg then up to 50mg and now I am at 100mg. I am a person that couldn't make phone calls , wouldn't leave the house alone, and I am at 0% anxiety. My mind is clear for the first time in years. Someone else used to term fearless and said they could tell people things they never would before. I kind feel that way as well.

Zoloft was the very first antidepressant I have taken. Honestly, taking this medication for the first time, you need to be prepared for every possible side effects. I’d recommend eating before taking the pill and taking a non-drowsy, anti-nausea medicine  eg Dramamine. So luckily I did not experience any nausea. I did experience tunnel vision, head  felt cloudy, it was almost like I was in a dream the first 3/4 days but it was manageable, I was very jittery and energetic but at the same time my muscles became weak when lifting almost anything .  My anxiety increased a lot the first 3 days. So I recommend starting this pill when you have a few days off from work.

Maybe that influenced it but both times  I tried it I found myself having intrusive violent thoughts which is not usual for me. The second time I had it it did not work out with Ritalin as it made me extremely depressed and had dark thoughts - granted that was only one day I took it but it was enough to reassure myself that I need to develop managing my anxiety without it as hard as that will be.

It is an awful feeling let me tell you but as long as you tell yourself to push through and do things to tire you out, it does get better. I would read, or watch boring sitcoms till I dosed off. I did take an over the counter sleep aid a few times when the restlessness was really bad and it did help.

I did not realize how effective Zoloft was until I decreased my dose. I started on 25mg, then 50mg did the trick for a while, & I ended with 75mg.  I was less aggravated, let things roll off my shoulder more, performed better at work, less depressed, a little numb, focused better, more social & confident etc. My personal experience was more than decent honestly. The reason why I decreased & plan to go on something different is because I felt I was gaining a bit of weight & it helped depression more than anxiety. In addition, I began having racing thoughts, struggled to stay asleep, & it gave me acid reflux. I was not comfortable increasing the dose in fear I'd have to increase more & more while also being fearful I'd gain more weight & have worsening acid reflux.

I've also been to talk therapy to work on these issues so I'm not forever dependent on medication.  It was my plan to wean myself at some point.  I forgot my medication for a week long vacation recently.  I guess you could say I was thrown into an involuntary cold turkey withdrawal.  Within a couple days, I experienced overwhelming nausea.  It has been 17 days since I took Zoloft and the nausea is still pretty strong.  Aside from the nausea, I have experienced a low grade headache and brain fog.  Had I known the withdrawal symptoms were challenging, I might have strongly reconsidered this medication.  I used to take Clonazepam on as as needed basis for anxiety and did not experience any withdrawal symptoms.  I hope these nausea symptoms improve soon.

My life overall is normal and I managed the episodes but I always knew they were there and didn't like feeling that way.

I don't want to scare anyone because I still functioned , Still was able to work, I was able to take care of the kids,  everything was pretty much normal but I could tell my mind was a bit off.

I started working out and that didn't bother me anymore. My wife would argue with me about normal marriage stuff but I wouldn't yell back. In fact I was able to see how foolish most of the fighting was and how pointless it was to yell back. My work life improved. My conversations with other people improved. I found myself more interested in what the person was saying and focusing more on what they were saying.At a follow up visit with my doctor he asked if I'd like to stay on the medication. I told him that my life has never been better and my mind never more clear so why would I choose to stop. He agreed and was happy with my progress.

I felt like posting here because I saw multiple reviews by people who had taken Zoloft for a few days, or a few weeks, and had bad experiences. I wanted to say that, though everyone is different, it will take at least a month or two before you start to feel ""better"" on any Anxiety med. Also, probably starting with a small dose and working your way up after several weeks would be a good idea. My GP told me to take half a pill, then go to a full pill after a week, which is crazy, and I had just about every side effect and dizziness for the first month. The second time around with Zoloft, I took one fourth of my pill, and ramped up every four days. If you have side effects, know that this is normal, and you will feel better soon.",Sleepy22116

My anxiety has been debilitating since my Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis in October of 2015. It became so bad that I was becoming bed ridden, afraid to leave my home. As a mother of 3 and a wife and daughter, my family needed me and I wasn't able to be there. I finally told my husband and parents I needed to seek help. After a therapy session and a visit with my family doctor I was given Zoloft. I received it on a Tuesday but was so afraid to take it, I didn't take my first one until Friday (I had read a few bad drug reviews, so I knew some things I could expect, but chose to focus on all the success stories for motivation.) For three weeks it was rough. Also must note, during this time we were hit with hurricane Matthew which didn't help and I believe set me back a few days. My side effects were tummy aches, diarrhea (sometimes 4 or 5 times a day), a few hot flashes, a couple days of zombie feeling, and I had 2 bad panic attacks. I know this sounds horrible, however, my opinion is that I felt as though I had hit rock bottom which is why I turned to medication. I already felt bad, so my commitment was to see this medicine through to the 4-6 week mark as instructed. If I had stopped taking it, I still would have felt horrible, that is what my life had become. With the wonderful support of my children and husband, a lot of take out food, and my parents helping to take and pick up my kids from school, I am SOOOOOO thankful I stuck with it and made it to the 4 week mark. I feel like I'm getting my life back. It is worth everything you go through. In full disclosure, some people get no side effects... my 20 year old son has been on Zoloft for a year and never had one side effect. I wasn't that lucky and seemed to have most.

It has definitely worked for me. This increase though I am noticing more dry mouth and stomach upset decreased appetite. I have had really bad anxiety about social situations and sleep (not getting enough) I hated going places or being around people. This medication has helped me greatly. I'm hoping it will continue to do so on 50 mg, and I hope to step back down so I do not get the burnout effect that so many people talk about.",Anonymous

I have dealt with anxiety my whole life and finally when I was having trouble going to school and work I turned to Zoloft. It has improved my quality of life. I have had the dose increased from 25 to 50 to 75. Side effects I have felt include: loss of appetite, dizziness, and mood swings. All side effects happened with start and increase of medicine and subside after getting used to it. I still have breakdowns sometimes but not as often. ",Anonymous
264,Zoloft,Social Anxiety Disorder,9.0,,"December 5, 2010",44,"I have been using Zoloft to treat mainly social anxiety for about 2 1/2 months now. I started off taking the lowest dosage- 25mg. Two weeks later, my psychiatrist doubled it to 50 mg, and four weeks later, he doubled it again to 100 mg, which is where I am at now. The first few days of starting it I felt absolutely miserable, and for those with severe depression, it may very well be debilitating. But I stuck through it! Over time, and still continuing, my moods have become remarkably stable and positive. My insecurities and obsessive negative thoughts, especially ones of a jealous nature, have nearly vanished. Sometimes it's harder to orgasm now, but my libido is still intact. Zoloft also helped me with me with my vaginismus and irritable bowel syndrome.",MellowFortress88

I've had social anxiety since I was 13 (I'm 22) but a year ago I had a traumatic experience and constantly felt like my stomach was in knots. After 3 months of feeling that way, I went to a doctor and was prescribed 25 mg Zoloft. The initial side effects were being incredibly tired (it was hard to stay awake just driving to class), dry mouth and anxiety for a short time. Eventually I was at 100mg/day and had lost about 12 lbs. I am on 75mg now, have been for about 9 months and have gained most of the weight back. Side-effects now are absolutely no sex drive and if I forget to take it I have ""brain shivers"". I definitely would recommend to anyone. I finally can talk to people without feeling my heart beat out of my chest.",Anonymous

I used to have terrible social anxiety, and was diagnosed with an anxiety and panic disorder. Since I have started taking Zoloft, my ability to speak with people has grown tremendously. I can't remember ever feeling happier than I do now, and the biggest change in me is the fact that I now feel emotionally stable. I'm only on 25mg, but I have found that it has helped me in incredible ways. The only side effects I have experienced are loss of appetite and slight nausea- I have lost a bit of weight while on this medicine, but not a dangerous amount. I highly recommend talking to your doctor about this medicine if you experience social anxiety, or have panic attacks.",Anonymous

I have been taking Zoloft for 3 days, and I am taking half of my 50mg dose for a week as the doctor said. The first day I took it I felt a sense that I was on top of the world, I didn't have any problems talking to people as I used to. I'm not sure if this was placebo, or if this drug is actually working. None of the other pills had worked for me. So far I have not experienced any changes in libido, but I have noticed my palms get clammy more than they used to. I am going to stick with this one for awhile.",16 y/o male
