0,Risperidone,Social Anxiety Disorder,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 21, 2021",1,"I have been taking SSRIs from a long time.But then my psychiatrist prescribed me this thing because she overeacted to a panic attack I had one night, I was afraid of taking it since I saw that it was prescribed to treat advanced mental health issues. But the worst was the awful side effects once I started.I have IBS, my physician got nuts when he heard that I was put under risperidone, I'd been having weird abdominal pain from almost 2 weeks. He told me this thing could cause megacolon. I returned to my standard SSRIs,  and stop having all those weird side effects.  Check the side effects, your family history and always try a second opinion.",Enhpow93
1,Risperidone,Social Anxiety Disorder,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2017",15,"It was an utter nightmare. I got heavy dissociation, felt like zombie just from one dose and couldn't shake it off for two days. It made me feel like I was sleepwalking and gave me more anxiety. I stopped it immediately. It was the worst I've ever felt. I then continued on SSRI's and had way better experience. My doctor made mistake with this prescription. Hope nobody else is given the wrong medication like I was.",heep
