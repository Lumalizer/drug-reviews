0,Sertraline,Social Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 25, 2022",1,"Zoloft (sertraline):I started on 50mg, after 2 weeks I went to 75mg without telling my doctor (he was on vacation for a week). I was on that for 4 days and then I told my doctor and he said if I feel comfortable going up that I can go to 100mg so I did. After 10 days my psychiatrist said if i want I can go to 150mg. so now todays my first day on that dosage. SAD 80% better, I still feel depressed most days, it probably just needs a couple more weeks for my body to get used to it. I can’t wait to see more results. The only side effect I got was migraines first couple days after dosage updates cause I’m prone to them.",jeremy422003
1,Sertraline,Social Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 17, 2022",2,"Zoloft (sertraline):I've been taking this medication on and off for years. It's really the only one I've found that helps with my general and social anxiety, and depression. I still suffer some dysthymia - but that's better than not being able to get out of bed. I developed social anxiety/phobia when I was around 14, but always felt 'different'. Unfortunately l am still somewhat isolated, due to avoidant habits developed over the decades... But I am able to function well at work, go shopping, go to the gym (when it's quiet!), and maintain a few friendships. I still don't feel any particular desire to socialise or seek company, but I also do not fear it as much when it becomes necessary. I have always taken 50mg. When I go off it, the old symptoms start creeping in over the course of a few months. I recognise that I could probably function even better if I increase my dosage. Increasing dosages has always seemed a bit scary, but I'm preparing to try 75mg for 8 weeks to assess the effect.",2BR02B

After that episode I started to have bad anxiety and panic attacks witch concluded with insomnia and loosing my appetite. My doctor prescribed me Zoloft 50mg .The first day I took it my anxiety was so much worse and I had panic attacks ending with me throwing up all day long. I was sure I was dying but my doctor told me to stick with it and I did .The first 3 weeks were the worse in my entire life I’ve never felt so bad  in my life and I started to read all the reviews in here and they gave me hope and I stick with it.

I can now say I have had zero social anxiety or even anxiety full stop since about 6 weeks into taking Sertraline. About 3 weeks in I started feeling significantly better. I had no side effects except being a little fatigued the first week. Two years on, I have been completely off the drug for a few months and I am still anxiety-free. It’s amazing, please try an SSRI like this if you are struggling.",Anonymous
6,Sertraline,Social Anxiety Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 22, 2022",1,Zoloft has helped my daughter with her social anxiety disorder. She also has panic attacks and OCD. She started on 25mg for a month and went to 50 mg for almost a month. She has definitely came out of her shell a little more. They may raise it again but I hope to get full recovery for her or enough that she can go a day without a headache or her stomach hurting from anxiety. We just did Genesight testing. If you are having issues with your meds or not finding the right ones then get this testing done. It tells the dr what meds work for your specific body. If your body does not metabolize SSRIs correctly then it’s not for you etc. You have to ask for it and they swab your mouth and send it out. Her psychiatrist ordered it because I had asked for it. It’s not always covered by insurance and may be $0-$300 but it is well worth it if you are seeing your specialist multiple times and changing drugs multiple times with no answers or hope.,Hope

10,Sertraline,Social Anxiety Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 13, 2021",1,"I took Sertraline for 4 years. I take it to lessen social anxiety. The side effect I have is a weaker erection. I have been on many other medications the past 2 years too so Sertraline may or may not be the cause of my poor erection quality so I don't want to blame it solely on that. I have been off Sertraline for about a month now, maybe a little longer, but now that I'm off it I noticed I'm getting depressed for no reason out of no where. I have no reason to be sad about anything in particular but I'm prone to depression again after not being depressed for several years. Sertraline helped me get over social anxiety which is the reason why I took it in the beginning and after being on it for 3-4 years I guess it helped with depression too. But being off Sertaline now has made me more prone to depression and I feel more agitated by people and things around me.",Vincent

After around just a week my social anxiety and generalized anxiety went down a lot, but I also found a lot of my other emotions like feeling motivated or happy also went down quite a bit. After more than 2 weeks it really started to work extremely well and I stopped overthinking every social situation and felt a lot more relaxed in social situations. Sadly, one side effect that has made me try to stop it was Apathy, which can be a side effect of ssri in general.

So basically I have been on and off taking sertaline for two years but never have been consistent on it. After reading the reviews I decided to start taking it again as was prescribed 150mg. The reason why I stopped taking this drug so many times is the awful beginning effects; its totally debilitating I have been in bed for the last two weeks with absolutely no energy, things like leaving the house or cleaning are so exhausting. I haven’t let my home for the last two weeks, the best way I can explain it is that I feel like gravity is just pushing my body down. I also have developed brown spots on my face, researched that this is also a less known symptom of sertaline. I also feel like a zombie and have a lot of brain fog, soForgive me if this post is all of over the place. Please if anyone has gone through this  please respond.",Jasmine

This is my second, almost third month I wanna say on Zoloft. At first I was finally able to sleep when I started 25mg 1x daily.  Over time I noticed most of my critical depression symptoms had improved so much to the point I was able to leave the house and drive again. Same with my anxiety, I can actually look people in the eyes when I speak without feeling shame, and I don’t always need excuses. Not saying I don’t have the obsessive thoughts, but I don’t feel hopeless anymore. Only real side effects for me would be, weird sleep cycles, appetite shifts, sweating, and erectile dysfunction would have to be my biggest drawback.

22,Sertraline,Social Anxiety Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 3, 2021",1,"Zoloft (sertraline):I started out on 25mg of sertraline and I was met with the expected heightened anxiety, jitters and a feeling of pressure in my head. The pressure faded after about 3-4 days, and I was left with the anxiousness for the next 3 weeks. I attempted twice to up my dose to 50mg (my prescribing physician wanted me to eventually graduate to 100mg), but each time I did, I experienced massive panic attacks that would wake me from my sleep (took sertraline in the morning). I did experience some improvement in my anxiety around that time, but not enough to warrant remaining at 25mg, so I've now switched to escitalopram. My experience might be a one-off, but I'd exercise caution when starting sertraline, especially if you are already prone to panic attacks - it certainly was a frightening experience for me, and not one I'd be keen to do over again.",Jumbi

I had developed agoraphobia during the pandemic, & have suffered with panic attacks since I can remember. I wasn't able to leave my flat/couldn't see family/ friends/most importantly couldn't get my covid jab. Even getting out of bed to go to the loo/shower seemed overwhelming to me. The Dr put me on Sertraline and he said I would feel well enough to get my jab within a month, I didn't believe him. I started on 25mg. The first week was tough for sure. I just kept reminding myself that I would be reaping the rewards soon. My main side effects were dizziness/loss of appetite/insomnia/tiredness. By the second week these were gone. I then upped to 50mg. Well, I've been on the tablets for 2 months. I've had my 1st Covid jab, been to the theatre several times, gone out for food with friends, seen my family.

I exercise, practice cbt, and maintain nutrition but anxiety and depression still take over my life. Went back on Zoloft.. started 25mg for 10 days and now 50mg seems to work pretty well. Literally 2 weeks after starting zoloft, anxiety, depression and sleep are improving. There are minimal side effects but initially some increase in anxiety and feeling high strung. If you would have spoke with me 3 weeks ago I was miserable, not anymore, looks like I'm a lifer on Zoloft and SSRI's but it beats my genetic nonstop mind torture.

41,Sertraline,Social Anxiety Disorder,10.0,,"February 9, 2021",9,"After having suffering from very serious and intense anxiety as a result of anabolic steroid abuse over years I finally decided to get help with a visit to the doctor. The first few weeks/months of sertraline were horrible. However after plugging away and biting the bullet sertraline has honestly changed my life. I feel like my old self, confident, outgoing and the best part is ...I feel normal again. I’m back working full time and socialising on the weekends which is such a huge step because I couldn’t leave my home at times because my anxiety was so bad. It probably took 4 months for sertraline to have its fullest effect on me. So be patient with this drug, it will take time. I also take CBD oil every day which has also been amazing at treating my anxiety. Also supplement fish oil, taurine, magnesium, vit d, and turmeric which are all also to have anxiety calming effects.",Codename12

The beginning I had awful insomnia that drove me crazy. I had anxiety worse than ever before, mood swings, crying often. But I heard it gets bad before it gets good. And my doctor kept pushing me to keep going too. So I did. Month by month, and going up every 2-3 weeks it was bad until I reached 150mg it was FINALLY better but not 100% until I got to 175mg. Everytime I went up, I had bad muscle tension that I had to go get massages.Despite how hard these past 4 months have been, it was worth the reward of the peace I have in my life now. I’ve become a better person. I am no longer depressed, and anxious. I am calm and understanding and have patience. I used to be very aggressive too but not anymore. The one side effect I still have to this day is vivid nightmares, night sweats and I wake up randomly in the middle of the night. Good luck to anyone out there!

I have severe anxiety and can’t sleep at night, the nausea is also horrific. I’m hoping these subside soon as I know the drug helped me before. I have noticed I’ve been given a different brand this time, maybe that is why the side effects are different.

I’d recommend eating before taking the pill and taking a non-drowsy, anti-nausea medicine  eg Dramamine. So luckily I did not experience any nausea. I did experience tunnel vision, head  felt cloudy, it was almost like I was in a dream the first 3/4 days but it was manageable, I was very jittery and energetic but at the same time my muscles became weak when lifting almost anything .  My anxiety increased a lot the first 3 days. So I recommend starting this pill when you have a few days off from work.

I took 25 mg for three weeks, followed by 25 mg in the a.m., and 25 mg in pm for 2 weeks, then final dose is 50 mg. Been on it for about 1 month now. Side effects come on quick, so that's why doc instructed me to take med this way. So far, side effects are little to none. I'm starting to feel so much better!!",Carol

I did not realize how effective Zoloft was until I decreased my dose. I started on 25mg, then 50mg did the trick for a while, & I ended with 75mg.  I was less aggravated, let things roll off my shoulder more, performed better at work, less depressed, a little numb, focused better, more social & confident etc. My personal experience was more than decent honestly. The reason why I decreased & plan to go on something different is because I felt I was gaining a bit of weight & it helped depression more than anxiety. In addition, I began having racing thoughts, struggled to stay asleep, & it gave me acid reflux. I was not comfortable increasing the dose in fear I'd have to increase more & more while also being fearful I'd gain more weight & have worsening acid reflux.

It has changed the way I feel just after couple of days. Doc prescribed me 50mg but the first day I took it it made me so sleepy I hated it. I was on Prozac once before for 2 months but stopped taking it because it made me so sleepy I would sleep like 14 hours a day and still feel tired. So I decided I could not feel like this again. Next day I cut the dose (bit the tablet of sertraline in half reducing it to 25mg) and i didn't feel sleepy anymore! I started to feel relaxed, after a week I've noticed my memory has improved and I can think more clearly. The overthinking went away almost completely.

I decided to get help because I was getting married and didn't want it to be the worst memory of my life.I'm now confident and not afraid. I can speak up. I enjoy work which is sales and I've improved drastically. I'm sweating less and have less nerves. No crazy heart pounding and mind blanking situations and unnecessary awkwardness. I could go on.. Be aware though, the 1st few days are intense.  I couldn't sleep a wink and my general anxiety was extreme. It was scary. Socially though, somehow I had improved the following day!!

The side effects I experienced were really terrible- increased anxiety for a few weeks... and I crapped my pants... but I promise, it was worth it. Now I'm 6 months on Zoloft and I don't suffer from social anxiety at nearly the same level as before. I feel much more confident speaking in front of groups and just being myself. I also feel less depressed.

I have just completed a 30 day supply of Zoloft. My anxiety has been debilitating since my Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis in October of 2015. It became so bad that I was becoming bed ridden, afraid to leave my home. As a mother of 3 and a wife and daughter, my family needed me and I wasn't able to be there. I finally told my husband and parents I needed to seek help. After a therapy session and a visit with my family doctor I was given Zoloft. I received it on a Tuesday but was so afraid to take it, I didn't take my first one until Friday (I had read a few bad drug reviews, so I knew some things I could expect, but chose to focus on all the success stories for motivation.) For three weeks it was rough. Also must note, during this time we were hit with hurricane Matthew which didn't help and I believe set me back a few days. My side effects were tummy aches, diarrhea (sometimes 4 or 5 times a day), a few hot flashes, a couple days of zombie feeling, and I had 2 bad panic attacks. I know this sounds horrible, however, my opinion is that I felt as though I had hit rock bottom which is why I turned to medication. I already felt bad, so my commitment was to see this medicine through to the 4-6 week mark as instructed. If I had stopped taking it, I still would have felt horrible, that is what my life had become. With the wonderful support of my children and husband, a lot of take out food, and my parents helping to take and pick up my kids from school, I am SOOOOOO thankful I stuck with it and made it to the 4 week mark. I feel like I'm getting my life back. It is worth everything you go through. In full disclosure, some people get no side effects... my 20 year old son has been on Zoloft for a year and never had one side effect. I wasn't that lucky and seemed to have most.

I am moving on soon, to Paxil or Lexapro, preferably Paxil. I'd recommend Zoloft for someone with a mix though",xDan
