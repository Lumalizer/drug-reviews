My psychiatrist told me it was from Paxil and I got hot, burning in some areas which hurt. I had to quit paxil I was on 30mg. Now I tried to quit and my anxiety is slowly coming back. I was thinking of trying zoloft because everyone is saying that it's great. So yeah sad but I  hope I will find some drug that will work great with me.",Mayah
1,Paroxetine,Social Anxiety Disorder,10.0,,"July 22, 2021",4,"Paxil (paroxetine):This drug changed my life in a positive way. I was put on (10 mg) for depression and social anxiety disorder. The only side effects were drowsiness, and it was a bit rough in the beginning as described (Restlessness, loss of appetite symptoms got worse before they got better, brain fog, etc.) But it was worth it. I can finally live my life. My brain fog diminished by a tenfold and I was able to talk to people, I was surviving in situations that would make me have a nervous breakdown only months prior. My depression lessened and I felt more happy again; I feel like I'm allowed to live again. I was scared to take this after reading all the negative experiences, but I've had not one regret after going on Paxil. I finally feel positive for the future.Paxil is different for everyone, and you need to see which medication works for you. It may be either a great or a terrible fit; you'll never know until you try it.",Daisy

Side effects stopped and I really did feel better Until now. 3 months in. And my hair is falling out in chunks. I'M FEMALE. My hair is thick and curly and one of the only things I liked about myself. Liked, because now it is thinner by half. I googled a link between paxil and hair loss and although poorly reported I wasn't the only one that has experienced this. Pills are not a cure.

I was thinking and trying to remember a really relaxed happy time and I remembered the paroxetine period. My whole life  since then has been gripped by fear and anxiety and fear of scrutiny I rang my Dr and asked if I could try it again. He was a bit reluctant because of the withdrawal problems but agreed. My goodness, I am SO thankful, within a week the anxiety and constant fear and tension had gone.

Not much effects on depression as of yet but anxiety is better and no hair pulling. Doc is happy about the progress and says I should give it 4 more weeks to see if it really is for me then we will go up in dose. As for me the benefits I see outweigh the negatives big time.

Now I have it mild to moderate and can have relationships, career etc. It took a couple months to know it actually did something. Am now on 40mg, 20mg works also but not as well. Might consider trying up to 60mg.I do augment with Propranolol 40mg 1-4 times a day and I feel it really helps for the physical symptoms.Side effects: Hard to reach orgasm, restless legs (countered with Gabapentin 600mg 1-2h before bed), memory not great. Having tried some other drugs for social anxiety (Gabapentin and Buspirone as well as a myriad of OTC stuff) I am convinced I feel Paroxetine is quite potent. I would like to try a MAOI type drug but in my country they are not really available without special license and even with it there is some hassle of getting it from the pharmacy etc.",kalle

And it really has made a huge difference. I can function like a normal human now. I’m not suddenly a social butterfly or anything, I’m still a rather shy person.

After about 12 weeks, I decided it didn't work and was ready to stop usage. I knew the withdrawals were pure hell, so I wanted to taper off very slowly, then one night I woke up and had this incredible sense of well-being. It was like all my anxiety and depression had suddenly disappeared. Since that moment all my anxiety has been gone.

I had to lay on the bed and talk myself out of the rapid heartbeat and sudden terror. A couple days later, I was practicing tennis with my team. Out of nowhere, my vision went black, but I was still conscious. I told the coach that I couldn't play anymore that day cuz I wasn't feeling well. He thought I was making excuses and told me to run 5 laps after practice. Anyway, I had to sit on the bench and calm myself down. I basically experienced a panic attack and nearly blacked out.

However, the side effects just became intolerable over time. What are those side effects? Well, for one, you will be tired all the time. Secondly, I found it really hard to focus, and I would forget things that just happened. Thirdly, and most disturbingly, I became a zombie who didn't care about anything and couldn't empathize with people!! I couldn't feel any emotions; I couldn't cry. Not only that, but it was also hard to experience positive emotions/pleasure. This phenomenon is called ""emotional bluntness"".

I suppose I've always felt moderately uncomfortable in size able groups and after my dad passed I was also very down in the dumps. Paxil helped immediately and made me way more sociable than ever before. I had confidence to say what I wanted to say and clearer thoughts than I've ever had. I've now been off for 4 months and am struggling again with the same issues. I've tried turning to herbal remedies like rhodiola, St johns wort, 5-HTP, and fish oil. Together they make me feel alright I guess but it's just not the same. If it weren't for the sexual side effects, I wouldn't hesitate to get back on Paxil but I'd like to get my wife pregnant soon so this is not an immediate option.",Joe D.
92,Paroxetine,Social Anxiety Disorder,9.0,,"June 14, 2011",76,Paxil (paroxetine):It has really made living life easier for me; but the only downside is that you become so un-shy that you can end up getting yourself into a lot of trouble. You care much less about the usual aspects of life such as school work or deadlines. It basically made me more prone to risky behavior.,Anonymous
93,Paroxetine,Social Anxiety Disorder,8.0,,"May 25, 2011",37,"Paxil (paroxetine):I developed an acute social anxiety disorder in my early 20's.  After trying 10mg of Paxil, my doctor upped the dose to 20mg.  I have been taking that dosage for the past 10 years.  My social anxiety is much more manageable than it was, although I still have my moments.  I hate to increase the dosage, however, because the sexual side effects have been bad for me.  Climax is next to impossible unless conditions are perfect, and even then it is a struggle.  My sex drive is also down, possibly because of the disappointment the lack of climax creates for me and my wife.  Personally, I am happy with the results of Paxil in terms of my social anxiety, but the sexual side effects are rough.  Good luck.",Anonymous

It served me well and improved my anxiety symptoms. Having gotten married 2 months ago, and anticipating getting pregnant, I began to wean myself off.  I went from 60mg/day to 40, then to 20, then 10, and now 5mg/day.  Each time I started to feel better and adjusted to the lower dose, I lowered it again.  The withdrawals have been awful.  I have been so sick for the last several weeks.  Nauseous, dizzy, insomnia, ""zaps"", no appetite, no energy.  Now at 5mg/day, I feel better.  The withdrawals are now quite tolerable.

My Doctor and I decided to ween me off due to feeling that it wasn't working as it used to and I didn't want to increase the dose. The weening process went too quickly and I suffered withdrawal symptoms- brain zaps, brain fog, crying, severe mood swings, just to name a few. I also had a rush of emotions that were hidden from being on it. My family and friends said that when I first started taking it, they noticed that I had been withdrawn but they thought that I was happy because my anxiety was gone. ",Anonymous

It didn't make me feel so good so after 6 months I went off it, cold turkey, and dealt with the withdrawal symptoms of that drug (zaps!).

In just these few weeks, my friends and I have noticed a huge change.  No weight gain, more energy, upbeat and outgoing, smiley and laughing, and optimistic for the first time in...my life?

After drinking alcohol to cover my anxiety and depression, my symptoms just got worse. I finally looked into lorazepam but I got a dose of 2 mg and it just knocked me out. Then I got Xanax 0.25mg and that made my face numb and I didn't like to smile, mainly my face felt weird and I was always to tired. Then finally I got 20mg Paxil and it helped right away. I felt like I could do and talk to anyone at anytime. Then I got used to it and jumped to the 30 mg which is doing alright. But the worst part of using this is constipation.

After 4 weeks, fill this prescription for 20 mg/day."" At 2-3 weeks, my son was raising his hand and greeting teachers in the hall. At 4 weeks, he initiated a belligerent locker room incident with a boy who mocked him. After doubling the dose, he was verbally aggressive to us and ran away.
