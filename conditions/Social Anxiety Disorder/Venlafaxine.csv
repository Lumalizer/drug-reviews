0,Venlafaxine,Social Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 20, 2022",3,"This medication has been a game-changer for me. After 15+ years of social anxiety, generalized anxiety, bulimia, and pure O OCD symptoms I finally have freedom from obsessive, anxious thinking. I tried SSRIs and Wellbutrin with no significant reduction in symptoms but 150 mg daily of this really, truly helps. I haven’t tried to wean off so I cannot speak to the withdrawal, but if you are considering trying this med please don’t scare yourself with horror stories. Those exist for all psychiatric meds but you and your doctor CAN find something that works for you, and you owe it to yourself to keep trying! Good luck :)",SHB
1,Venlafaxine,Social Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 19, 2022",1,"Okay so I had no idea this medication was used for migraines...cool cause I've had one for 3 days since I increased my dosage from 37.5 mg to 75 mg. Right now it's not bad just a little eye pain when I move my eyes hard down and up. Right so the reviews I've seen...I'm pretty sure this medicine is for people with social phobia and anxiety which I have. So the people saying they were outgoing and then started taking this...I don't understand why they needed this drug if they didn't have social anxiety to begin with. I legit have intrusive evil thoughts, social anxiety, introverted behaviors...I don't like people to put it bluntly and coronavirus made that more clear to me during the short lockdown we had. Going back into society after that was really hard for me cause not only did u not want people around me but I was freaked out about the virus. This drug has helped me so much so it depends on the person. Also sex drive went up A LOT big bonus",These reviews..
2,Venlafaxine,Social Anxiety Disorder,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 9, 2022",0,"I’ve been on Venlafaxine XR for about 7 months now. It’s tremendously helped my depression. It’s also helped my social anxiety as well, I’m able to show my emotions way more and have a lot less intrusive thoughts at 150 mg. I still do have intrusive thoughts, but they’re greatly reduced. I’ll probably ask for a dose increase because it wasn’t until 150 mg which I noticed a general change in my social anxiety and I’ve seen people go as high as 300 mg for anxiety if need be, but likely I won’t go that high. Side effects: For a week or two after increasing the dose it gave me erectile dysfunction (I’m only a teenager..) & an inability to ejaculate, but it went away. Also I'm not sure if it’s the medication but it seems like ever since being on Venlafaxine XR I have a harder time controlling my anger.",joey_12346
3,Venlafaxine,Social Anxiety Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 19, 2021",1,"Effexor XR (venlafaxine):My social anxiety resolves around me feeling inept, boring, awkward, annoying & straight up unlikeable. Also resolves around me feeling judged harshly by others. It ruins social situations. Situations I experience this are around strangers, answering the door/phone, meeting new people, hanging out, shopping, school, the list goes on. I've been on Venlafaxine XR for depression and social anxiety since late July and it’s helped give my my emotions back so I feel less boring but I still overthink a ton, albeit less. My anxious thoughts are somewhat suppressed but they’re still there. It’s been helpful for depression but for social anxiety I feel maybe an increased dosage to 225 would benefit me since I feel it working just not enough.",Joey

10,Venlafaxine,Social Anxiety Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 25, 2020",51,"This medication  Effexor saved my  life. As soon as I hit my 20s my social anxiety got ridiculously worse. I became depressed, was abusing drugs and eventually suicide felt like the only option. I failed out of uni which made things worse. But despite all of this I remembered that my social anxiety is mental illness and that my brain needed help. I am a good person and I deserve to be happy. This affirmation allowed me to finally go see a doctor to discuss medication. I started Effexor immediately and took it every day. 6 months later I completely changed in the best way possible!!! I am finally happy, confident, in control of my thoughts, social and at peace. I highly recommend this medication, be patient with it as it does take a while to fully work. Worth the  wait though let me tell ya!!! Stay strong my friends and please never give up. ❤️",Ellie
11,Venlafaxine,Social Anxiety Disorder,,,"January 23, 2020",132,"Effexor XR (venlafaxine):This drug has been amazing for me. My NP first started me on Zoloft 50mg and I felt no difference and then bumped me up to 100 mg and my anxiety got super bad, which I didn’t even know was possible because I have severe social anxiety. I got prescribed 75 mg of Effexor and the side effects were really bad the first 2 weeks and I was ready to tell my NP that this wasn’t the drug for me but I gave it about 2 more weeks and noticed a HUGE difference. Before taking this when I would walk into class my heart would be beating so fast that I thought I would have a heart attack, I would be shaking so much and would feel like I can’t even walk or function at all. But with this drug I was able to walk into class calmly, no shaking, and didn’t even mind asking a question in front of the class. I never in a million years thought I would have the courage to do that. I know everybody is different but this drug really has saved my life!!",Andrea
12,Venlafaxine,Social Anxiety Disorder,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 15, 2020",5,"venlafaxine is an odd drug- feels very different than lexapro, which I was on previously for years. If you’ve ever taken transdermal-scop it feels similar, very anticholinergic for me. Pros- Less apathetic/blank/dead than I felt on lexapro, more confident in social situations, more assertive, less panicked in social situations, less drained by social encounters, less mute.  Cons- Dry mouth, dilated pupils, still get quite depressed, reactive mood, psychomotor agitation/sometimes feel like I’m going crazy or crawling out of my skin, less empathy, less friendly. While I function better socially, I feel less inclined to be social in the first place. I take a dose of venlafaxine 75mg XR at night with 45mg Remeron. Overall a peculiar med, not the best, going to try Nardil next.",Anonymous

I suffer from social anxiety, and this medication, especially at higher doses (>225mg/day), helps me function more comfortably in social settings. I feel more relaxed, less self-conscious, and generally more able to communicate comfortably with others.  I don’t experience many side effects which is a blessing.

In the beginning I noticed a few side effects however this medication has been amazing for me. I have missed a dosage by accident and did not notice any symptoms I work really hard not to miss any dosages. I don’t think I even realized how bad my anxiety was until I started this medication I feel like a new person it is helped me a lot. However I think medication works differently for everybody, everybody’s body chemistry is different so it might react well for some and not so well for others. I think it’s important to have open communication with your doctor and to talk about negative and positive side effects you might be feeling with any medication.",Mer

The first week every  thing that I was taking the drug to cure - was heightened x10. I couldn't look my father in the eyes and I was for the most part barricaded up in my room. I toughed through it and was giving it a month for my body to accept it. Boy am I glad I did. I have a very colorful personality so it didn't turn me into a zombie by any means but put me back down to earth. I could focus outward rather then inward when around people. For the first time I could be my self for once. The withdrawals are terrible so if you choose to take this drug makes sure you are strict on the time and frequency. When off these I would get these brain rushes every 5 minutes, greatly increased emotions, and I always wanted to eat. My sex drive and ejaculation is nearly nonexistent when on the drug though but the positive effects make the side effects very minimal for me.",R0cKr0bsta

32,Venlafaxine,Social Anxiety Disorder,7.0,,"January 16, 2018",14,"In a nutshell, Effexor 150mg works best for Social Anxiety out of any SSRI or SNRI that I have tried. It also alleviates symptoms of associated with depression. 150mg is the ideal maintenance dosage. It will increase blood pressure and withdrawal can be deadly once discontinued, hence why your doctor needs to taper you off carefully. Keep in mind that this medication and any other SNRI(I.E. Cymbalta) can send anyone with Bipolar or Bipolar tendencies, spiralling into mania. You may find yourself drinking more, shopping, gambling, spending, etc. It should be coupled with Mirtazapine, as it will curb the effects of the Effexor.
