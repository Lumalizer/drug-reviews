0,Modafinil,Idiopathic Hypersomnia,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 18, 2022",2,"Provigil worked great at first. My body developed a tolerance very quickly though, and I had to start taking 200mg twice a day. Even though I’m taking this much of it every single day I am still really tired and have no energy. I might as well not even be taking the medication. The benefits are so minimal. It’s like instead of sleeping 20 hours a day, I sleep 19 hours a day. there’s not enough improvement.",sleepyhead
1,Modafinil,Idiopathic Hypersomnia,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 13, 2022",0,"My experience with modafinil has been good.  I've always had issues of severe ""sleep attacks"" about three times per day. Coffee tends to put me in a fog 9 out of 10 times.  So I would take short, power naps (< 30 minutes) to help alleviate the attacks.  The naps never truly brought me back to life. The worst of the attacks would be around 6pm. I would yawn a few times per minute and felt like I would faint.   With two kids under three, that can be a big problem as I'd have to leave the family for a moment while I napped. I slowly increased the dosage and found 200mg worked best.  I no longer have those huge crashes nor feel faint.  That being said,  I've found that I need to take it within two hours of waking up.  When starting the medication, I could feel the jitteriness but after a week that went away.  When you first start out, skip the coffee to see how the pill affects you by itself.",mafrazie
2,Modafinil,Idiopathic Hypersomnia,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 17, 2021",2,"At first this worked just okay for me. It worked for about 4-5 hours before I crashed hard, but I took it twice a day (100mg twice a day, combo with 10mg Adderall) and that worked better. In the past month, I noticed problems when at practices for my college swim team. When we were in more intense practices I felt like I reached a cap in regards to energy, I couldn't go any faster, felt out of breath, like my lactic acid was at its max after barely starting a hard set. Even when I didn't take the Adderall I had these same problems, after going to my dorm my heart rate was at 162, like it was going to jump out of my chest. After connecting the dots I remembered I've been short of breath a lot more often than I should be, just thinking my asthma was worse.Turns out, Modafinil is a Histamine inhibitor, which can cause the bronchials to swell and cause allergies. I'll have to halt  Provigil and Nuvigil unfortunately. It worked great for me, until it made me a worse breather.",Mark
3,Modafinil,Idiopathic Hypersomnia,9,,"November 15, 2021",1,This is the only thing that keeps me alert and ready for the day. It does not replace sleep. If I didn’t get a good night sleep of course it will not work as well. It must be taken in the morning or you will be awake super late. I cannot start my day without it. If I do not take it I will stay in bed napping all day.,Amanda
