0,Xywav,Idiopathic Hypersomnia,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 17, 2022",5,"I'm just about 30 years old. I've always known I had sleep problems but never thought of it as a medical condition until the idiopathic hypersomnia became majorly disruptive in my life. I tried so many stimulants and sleep aids and nothing seemed to work. This drug has greatly improved my life over the last 3 months. The dosing of the drug is still tricky for me. But I feel that I have my life back. I used to not not eat dinner because I was too tired after work to eat. And now I have enough energy to cook and even clean sometimes. I take 3.75g once nightly, and with 6 hours of sleep, I felt better than I ever did from 12 hours of sleep before I started taking the medication. I don't feel like superman, but the improvement is noticeable. No negative (besides during the first month) side effects besides a bit of teeth grinding in the middle of the day and making weird noises at night sometimes. Night sweats are common, but with the cold air cranked up, sometimes I never notice.",Sleepyman47
1,Xywav,Idiopathic Hypersomnia,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 14, 2021",4,"After 6 weeks of minimal response, I awoke and suddenly the room was spinning. That was my last dose. It's been 3 days...headache and nausea persist along with a loss of visual acuity. Withdrawal symptoms can last 3 to 14 days according to the literature. Wow, I'm still on day 3.",former patient
2,Xywav,Idiopathic Hypersomnia,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 6, 2021",11,"I knew I had the answer after the first night taking Xywav. I have struggled with excessive daytime drowsiness most of my life but now I am awake before my alarm and have no desire to nap. This is better than I could have dreamed. I have been living life with one arm tied behind my back. I now have full use of bothâ€¦ a new lease on life. I never knew life could be so enjoyable. I thought everyone was as sleepy as me, just that everyone else had self control or discipline. I am so grateful for Xywav.",JEF
