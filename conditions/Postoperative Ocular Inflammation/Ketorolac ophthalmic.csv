I am seriously allergic to aspirin and Acular states that it is unsuitable for People who are aspirin allergic.There must be an alternative that surgeons could prescribe.",Duval

2,Ketorolac ophthalmic,Postoperative Ocular Inflammation,10.0,,"July 13, 2016",4,"My doctor had me on a dosage of Acular LS of one drop per eye per day.  It ELIMINATED my photophobia (sensitivity and pain) which was caused by cornea transplants that I needed to treat my Keratoconus.Even though my dosage was 1/4 the normal dosage recommendation my doctor took me off the Acular LS since a known effect of the medication at normal dosages is thinning of the cornea.I have found no other treatment that helps with my photophobia.This stuff will sting when you use it, but it definitely works.  For the time that I used it, I could participate in outdoor activities, view fireworks, basically tolerate normal activities.  Without it, I'm confined to a dark hole.So the product is great!  Just wish I could continue using it.",Greg O
