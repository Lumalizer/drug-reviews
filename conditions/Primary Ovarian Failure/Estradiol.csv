0,Estradiol,Primary Ovarian Failure,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 27, 2021",0,Vivelle-Dot (estradiol):Anyone experiencing a drop off feeling using the dot after 2-2 1/2 days? Thought about adding some estradiol gel to the dot for this. Suggestions ?,Nerual1
1,Estradiol,Primary Ovarian Failure,1.0,,"May 23, 2021",13,"Estradiol Patch (estradiol):Last month walmart pharmacy replaced my estradiol patch to ""mylan"" manufacturer. I was shocked to see how big this patch is, it's bigger than the mouth of a colostomy bag, as thick as a regular cotton rounds, and it's not sticky enough to stay for days. I shower twice a day, the patch is off after 2 showers, technically I have to change my patch everyday. The worse part is aside from the rashes l have now on my pelvic area because of this patch, l'm having hot flashes. It's not effective at all. I cannot do anything since my insurance already paid for 3 months of refill. And since I have to replace patch  everyday, l already run out of it. Now, l have to endure more ""hot flashes"" for 2 more months. This is the worse patch l used since my hysterectomy. Well, thank you ""Mylan"" for making my life miserable for 3 months. I will rate negative on the effectiveness if it's available on the choices.",Jlowe24
2,Estradiol,Primary Ovarian Failure,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 3, 2021",64,"Estradiol Patch (estradiol):I’m 60 and had my ovaries removed 11 months ago. So for 5 months I have been using a new bio identical biest estriol & estradiol prescription along with progesterone gel. My hot flashes were bad, my vaginal irritation was unbearable.  I Changed to estradiol gel and progesterone gel. My Hot flashes got so severe and vaginal irritation was so unbearable. I Finally decided to try the estradiol 0.075 patch changing 2 times a week. In just 2 days saw incredible improvement in hot flashes, mood energy, motivation, emotional mood.   It gave me relief from all my symptoms. The brand I was given is manufactured by Mylan, which was given absolutely horrible low reviews. I was scared it wasn’t going to work for me, but decided to try it anyway because I was so very miserable. Can’t tell you how much relief I am feeling being in the patch and taking the progesterone micronized 100 mg pill. It’s been a lifesaver for me.",Rosie B
3,Estradiol,Primary Ovarian Failure,6.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 11, 2020",1,I had a medical required complete hysterectomy at age 55 and Vivelle-dot worked great for me. My insurance quit paying for Vivelle-dot and I was switched to Sandoz brand which didn’t work as well but helped some. Then the pharmacy switched to Mylan  estradiol patch which was a complete disaster. I got welts and sores to the point of bleeding and scarring using Mylan. Most all the pharmacies in my area only carry Mylan and it is a challenge to find out which brand they carry. I can no longer find Sandoz in my area and am trying Dotti which Is not as bad as Mylan.,Maksmom
4,Estradiol,Primary Ovarian Failure,1.0,,"May 24, 2020",5,"Estradiol Patch (estradiol):I did not have a positive experience with this patch.  I received the Minivelle dot and used it for a thin uterine lining.  I wore it for about an hour and felt hot, clammy, dizzy, and my heart rate went through the roof.  I also started sweating profusely.  I immediately took it off and the symptoms went away a few hours later.Several months later, I unknowingly received the same script from my endocrinologist for Minivelle for primary ovarian failure due to endometriosis and PCOS complications.  I decided to try it again - this time with a Xanax in case the symptoms were due to anxiety.  They happened again anyway so it was confirmed that it was the patch.  I am very sensitive to hormones and have not tolerate many forms of birth control pills, so I am not surprised.",MissLeopard83
5,Estradiol,Primary Ovarian Failure,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 21, 2020",3,"Estradiol Patch (estradiol):I started getting perimenopausal at age 34. I went on the estraderm patches which were a 5 layer gel patch, you could actually see the gel medication. They were the first estradiol patch produced and have probably been out of production 7 years.They were replaced by all these much cheaper to produce single layer patches with just a sticky adhesive side which is supposedly the drug delivery system. Climara, Vivelle, etc, NONE of them worked on me, my blood estrogen levels were at the most 19. Transvaginal delivery didn't work either.I don't believe in oral estrogens so now I inject myself IM every 2 weeks with estradiol valerate.",drjudy
6,Estradiol,Primary Ovarian Failure,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 14, 2019",0,"Started using the mylan estradiol patch .1mg big heavy round patch 2 weeks ago. Medication seems fine, my low rating is because the patch itself is bulky and uncomfortable. 2mm thick pad that I feel constantly, all day long. Beyond bulky and bothersome! I do not recommend!",pmbourque
7,Estradiol,Primary Ovarian Failure,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 6, 2018",11,Climara (estradiol):I just started using the patch a couple of months ago. It took me about half an hour to get the patch removed from the backing and ended up tearing it in half—very frustrating. I tried putting the patch in the fridge the night before application and it peeled away from the backing easily! I love the way the product works and now I don’t need to worry about struggling with the packaging.,Podfan
8,Estradiol,Primary Ovarian Failure,5.0,,"June 28, 2017",1,"I am 18 and was diagnosed with Primary Ovarian failure. The patch is ok, but I don't get enough estrogen and have to take an extra pill everyday. At first, I gained weight from taking this estrogen and I got super moody. I have been able to control my mood for the most part, and I don't think I will gain anymore weight. If I forget to put a patch on, my hot flashes get really awful. My periods are now about 4 months apart and the patch was the safest option in case I try to get pregnant. Overall the patch is alright. I would recommend it to women older than me.",BXBXBXBX
9,Estradiol,Primary Ovarian Failure,10.0,,"October 24, 2015",31,Vivelle-Dot (estradiol):Had preovarian failure at 30. Started on vivell dot and prometrium at age 38. Am now 60 and I will never come off. No side effects. I also added testosterone supplement injection and I am a new person. All this helps with mental stability and weight control and energy.,Isotope
10,Estradiol,Primary Ovarian Failure,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 22, 2014",14,"Vivelle-Dot (estradiol):I started premature ovarian failure/menopause at 31 and I'm now  35. I was skeptic of using the patch because of the side effects so I resorted to other forms of estrogen by birth control pills and changing my diet. They seemed to only work temporarily 2-3 months at a time and then the hot flashes and night sweats came back along with irritability and no libido. I finally said enough and tried Vivelle and after 2 weeks the hot flashes and not sweats were gone. I am currently on the ""week off"" of the patch so far so good. I can say that the only side effects that I've noticed is weight gain and breast swelling. I would recommend this patch to anyone in my similar situation.",hot flashes
11,Estradiol,Primary Ovarian Failure,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 28, 2012",50,"Vivelle-Dot (estradiol):I am in my early forties and menopause hit me at an early age. I struggled with whether or not I should go on HRT due to the risks.  With that said, the symptoms were creating shear havoc in my life (severe hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia and decreased libido-my poor husband).  I am happy to say that after my first application, I slept through the night for the first time in two years!  My hot flashes have decreased and I don't have that foggy feeling in my head. I am on Vivelle dot and a progesterone regimen. (light doses).  I began Vivelle dot two weeks ago and would highly recommend it.",Well Rested & Content

13,Estradiol,Primary Ovarian Failure,7.0,,"January 14, 2011",14,"Estrace (estradiol):I've been on Estrace for just over 2 years to treat Primary Ovarian Failure. I have grown about 3 inches taller, my breasts have not increased in size, they are just constantly sore. I have been getting a lot of discharge, which is not overly pleasant. I get dizzy spells sometimes. I have gained about 15 pounds in 2 years again not the greatest, but my growth could have something to do with it. Acne, comes and goes sometimes it is horrible, other times my skin is great! My feet have also grown 1.5 sizes. I am very moody. That comes along with being young though. Overall, I would give it a 6/10, as I did not notice too many pleasant side effects, however it handled my problem inside.",Anonymous
14,Estradiol,Primary Ovarian Failure,8.0,,"October 8, 2009",28,"Estradiol Patch (estradiol):It's rather early for me to be rating this product considering it has been just under 2 weeks since I started it. However, I am very pleased with it so far. I was on Vivelle Dot for about 4 months and after the first month, all my symptoms came back. I have just started this patch and so far it is wonderful! I feel a million times better, my hair is better, no more hot flashes and I'm starting to sleep again! The only complaint I have is that the patch is HUGE and it's thick and beige rather than small and clear like Vivelle. But at this point, I could care less what it looks like as long as it works!
