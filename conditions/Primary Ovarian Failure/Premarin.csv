0,Premarin,Primary Ovarian Failure,10.0,,"March 12, 2018",45,Had a hysterectomy at age 35 with ovaries left in tact. Night sweats appeared gradually and by age 53 were intolerable. I was awake most of night and kept my husband up as well. Was prescribed Premarin at the lowest dose. I experienced relief after 2 days. I can’t believe how much better I feel. Now 2 weeks in my brain fog is gone and I am so happy. I didn’t realize how depressed I was. No side affects at all. Just look forward to peaceful sleeps at night,Fbuds
1,Premarin,Primary Ovarian Failure,,,"June 5, 2017",21,"I'm 75 and have been taking 1.25 since l had a full hysterectomy at 36. 10 years ago cut dose to .65 at Dr recommendation. Noticed no change. Now taking .325 for about 4 weeks. Do notice I'm not tired, not as ""happy""... All those years no side effects.  Bone density excellent. General health excellent.. Think I'll go back to .65 but its expensive and insurance will not cover due to my age.",Suncitycool
2,Premarin,Primary Ovarian Failure,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 18, 2016",25,I've been on premarin for over 20years. When I started I had side effects of bloating and constipation. Over time those resolved. I don't know why I'm still having hot flashes 20+ yrs after menopause. Now I take.625 every other day due to the expense. That works. If I try to cut back to every third day the hot flashes return in a short time.,Midwestern
3,Premarin,Primary Ovarian Failure,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 17, 2012",24,"Worked great for many months. Then I started noticing my hair falling out, bladder irritation, and then the dark spots that were staying put while the rest of my summer tan was fading. It was great while it lasted though.",Anonymous
4,Premarin,Primary Ovarian Failure,10.0,,"August 31, 2011",57,"I couldn't take Premarin for about 5 years when I needed to because of cancer. I had bad symptoms. You name it - as far as having a hard time while being in my ""change"" period, I had them all. When the doctor finally put me on Premarin and it took effect I could have jumped for joy. I was myself again. I loved being on it. All the symptoms went away. I was so thankful. I was on it for many years. I tried to cut back at times but all the bad feelings would come back. Last year my doctor took me off it. He told me to take Estrace. It would be better for me. I'm having a hard time. Estrace does not work and my symptoms are back with a furry. I'm trying to find a doctor that will give me Premarin. ",Anonymous
