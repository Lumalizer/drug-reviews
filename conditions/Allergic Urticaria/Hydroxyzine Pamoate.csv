1,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Allergic Urticaria,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 15, 2022",0,Had case of shingles so pcp kept treating my back rash as if shingles. Nine times to be exact. Allergist treats me for mastocytosis. He upped my dosage of hydroxyzine from 20mg at nite( for excessive sweating) to 10mg during day spaced out so I have constant coverage. First time in a year I’m getting relief from itching. Because I take a lower dosage I don’t seem to get slammed with sleepiness? More effective than any other antihistamine I’ve taken.,Pjg
2,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Allergic Urticaria,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 22, 2021",0,Since being a teen I have  taken 100 mg that’s four tablets before bed for chronic hives. I also have insomnia the hydroxyzine has no affect on it at all I do however have strange dreams that I think are linked to the hydroxyzine. The dreams do not bother me that much they are just strange and could be described like a lucid dream. Hydroxyzine does help my hives most of the time like it’s meant to  it takes them away for about 23ish hours it’s like clock work .I never forget to take my medicine because if I’m even an hour over I’ll break out in hives,Joyo

4,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Allergic Urticaria,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 27, 2020",13,"I have chronic hives and have been taking this for over 5 years. I got my first outbreak of hives 17 years ago and they have never gone away. Biopsies, testing, blood work, and multiply doctors to no avail. I am prescribed 25 mg as needed but only go through 60 pills a year. They immediately take that deep itch away, so I’m not making myself bleed and driving myself crazy. The downside is you do stay groggy for over 12 hours but sleep like a baby. I will take that over the itching and rash any day. I highly recommend this. The doxepin I was on prior made me so mean and I didn’t even care.",Jen

I took the prednisone but not the antihistamine. Dumb me. The rash got better but the back of my head began to itch terribly.  As a result large welts began to form. My hands itched and other welts on my legs and chest began to form. So, I decided to take my hydroxyzine. I took it right before bed. When I woke up all the welts were nearly all gone. My hands stopped itching. This drug works wonders. Yes, it made me a little sleepy. Who cares. It knocked my hives out like a heavyweight boxer.",John.

In the past I've had debilitating hives and rash no matter what I was doing. It could be from showering or clothing myself to running on a treadmill. They were painful and felt like I had been dipped into a vat of itching powder. It could last hours to days. Summer and Winter were brutal for my skin. It has literally changed my life. Yes the first week or so, it made me super drowsy. Doctor recommended to take it at night instead of morning and night. I take one pill in the morning now that it doesn't make me sleepy.

I kept talking about how I hated the drowsy feeling that I had all day if I had to take Benadryl at night, because of my eczema induced hives. Three  Benadryl didn't do to me what this stuff did.  I took it last night, because I was starting to get a little itchy and I've been a stinkin' zombie all day!  I have slept my whole Saturday away!  I am so furious that I put the pills into the garbage disposal and will be changing doctors.  Why don't they listen instead of pretending to listen?  Don't take this stuff, definitely don't drive for several days after you've taken it!  I've been taking several Allegra at a time and it's taken away the itching & I've been willing & able to complete daily task",james516

Once I got on a cycle of of 40 mg hydroxyzine before bed and 150 mg ranitidine +5 mg of levocetirizine in the mornings I started to have noticeable improvement. After another 4 months my hives were completely gone. Of the three medicines, the hydroxyzine by far provided the biggest impact. This medicine stopped hives from forming during sleep and the anti-anxiety component definitely helped sooth my mood and get me to sleep more quickly.I will say that this medicine gives you some really wacky and vivid dreams. It also makes you feel very groggy after taking it, lasting well into the next morning. Those symptoms are worth it though.",Corb89

I managed to sleep through the night for over 9 hours - the alarm didn't manage to wake me until my 2nd super loud alarm! I was awake BUT I wasn't really AWAKE! I felt like I can doze off any second. Unless you want to sleep thru 24-hours maybe this is good for you but I won't be taking it the 2nd time. I felt horrible for the whole day! My mind was not functioning, I felt groggy, not alert at all, walk like zombie, it was just bad for me. I like to feel AWAKE! Not like this. My suggestion: Take with CAUTION!",FeyFey

I have never had a problem with drowsiness. The only time I realize I have this condition is if I run out of the medication and don't take it for a few days, then the itching comes back, usually starting on the palms of my hands.

A 5mg dose rapidly eliminates hives and has a lasting effect for 2-3 days. My doctor gives me an annual prescription for 30, 25mg tablets which I cut into four pieces. I only take 1/4 tablet therefore this very small dose completely resolves the hives for several days with minimal side effects consisting of slight drowsiness. For me, it is a marvelous medicine.

It worked 100%. Later in life they suggested I try some other antihistamine (Claritin), which I did and it worked but I have to take a pill every day so I went back to Atarax as I did not suffer from drowsiness (after taking it for so many years). Fortunately in 2011 the Urticaria disappeared and I no longer need any meds for it. If ever I get itchy skin again, Atarax will be my choice.",ItchyScratchy2

That is how I react to Benadryl, but not to Allegra, which doesn't seem to affect my sleeping. The little bit of relief that I have gotten from taking it is not worth the complete loss of sleep.

Then I found a new doctor who prescribed hydroxyzine and fexofenadine. Two days later 99% of the problem was gone. It flares up when I eat any meats with preservatives (sodium nitrate and sodium phosphate) and berries with small seeds (figs, raspberries, strawberries, blue berries, etc).

For the first time in months, I went an entire day without any hives - though I had to take the capsule four times a day.  If I took fewer capsules, my hives would come back.
