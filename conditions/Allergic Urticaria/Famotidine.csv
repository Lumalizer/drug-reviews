0,Famotidine,Allergic Urticaria,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 17, 2022",0,"I have a lot of allergies, grass, trees, outdoor mould, both kinds of dust mites, but the really bad ones are cold uticaria (hives when my skin gets cold) and food allergy to cashews and walnuts. I just went through an accidental exposure to cashews in my Asian Sesame Salad 2 days ago (who puts cashews in a sesame salad!). While I still experienced a lot of stomach pain.... I did not get hives down my throat with swelling, no throwing up for hours and no real gastric issues other than pain for a few hours. No EPIPEN used! I did add benadryl as soon as the pain occurred and I discovered what I had done... But Famotidine is a game changer for me! My allergies are better and no more hives all winter! As well as the best ever response to accidental exposure to Cashews! And the prescription generic is so darn cheap...",Cherie
1,Famotidine,Allergic Urticaria,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 1, 2015",66,"I took Zyrtec everyday for a month and saw zero improvement with my sudden outbreak of hives. Then I was advised to take double doses of Zyrtec AND Allegra. Only thing I got was sleepy. I've been taking Famotidine for three days. I saw almost immediate results. Today is day 3, and all my hives are gone. The itching is virtually gone. Even the dark spots the hives were leaving behind before seem to be fading. I haven't noticed any side effects except my extreme joy that something finally worked!",MIkaesia
2,Famotidine,Allergic Urticaria,6,,"September 17, 2009",45,"I just started taking it but I'm already seeing results. When I read that a lesser side effect was muscle cramps it bothered me a little. But, otherwise I'm seeing almost instant results.",Micah77
