0,Vistaril,Allergic Urticaria,10,,"May 10, 2020",13,"About 2 or 3 weeks ago, I started to get itchy after taking bath, I was very very itchy. My whole body was itchy and I was about to go crazy, It was like thousands of ants were running in my skin. It was very awful. I ran to the drug store and bought Hydroxyzine 25mg and hopefully this medication helped me. I've been taking it daily.",Henry
1,Vistaril,Allergic Urticaria,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 5, 2013",77,"Have taken Vistaril for nearly 30 years for hives that seem to be associated with exposure to hot/cold temperatures or emotional stress. A 5mg dose rapidly eliminates hives and has a lasting effect for 2-3 days. My doctor gives me an annual prescription for 30, 25mg tablets which I cut into four pieces. I only take 1/4 tablet therefore this very small dose completely resolves the hives for several days with minimal side effects consisting of slight drowsiness. For me, it is a marvelous medicine. Cost, even without insurance is extremely small.",Roachie
2,Vistaril,Allergic Urticaria,9,,"June 6, 2010",46,"My Doctor diagnosed me with dermatographia, and prescribed Singulair and Alavert.  The condition lessened, but did not go away.  I would still break out into hives on a daily basis, though they were not as frequent and covered a smaller portion of my body.  After a few months, she prescribed Vistaril in place of Alavert, and kept me on the Singulair.  Almost immediately, I noticed a significant change!  For the first time in months, I went an entire day without any hives - though I had to take the capsule four times a day.  If I took fewer capsules, my hives would come back.  I did experience severe drowsiness and a slight ""euphoric"" feeling, but it lessened over time.",Anonymous
