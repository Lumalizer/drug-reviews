0,Rituxan,Microscopic Polyangiitis,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 28, 2021",0,"I started on rituximab two years ago due to vascularitus which attacked my kidneys. I lost 50 percent of kidney function. I was already suffering from RA and was using embrel and methotrexate. Rituximab now treats both illnesses for me. I did however get  pneumonia twice in the second year but maybe that was due to the fact that l missed taking my antibiotic sometimes, so follow your doctors instructions well. I am so thankful for this treatment, l am in great form, had no side effects, no pain and my illnesses are stable. Scientific progress is great.",Cathy
