0,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 15, 2021",0,"Hi! I just remembered this website after coming across it back in the summer, several months ago. While reading these reviews, it frightened me because I was previously on Yasmin, which caused me to have weight gain but helped my acne. I decided to just give this pill a go. I was diagnosed with PCOS at the age of 16 after having extreme irregular periods and cystic acne.  My acne was my biggest issue, as those were my only signs (not over weight at all)  I was on Yasmin all throughout HS until this summer, where I really realized it had made me gain so much weight (15lbs) & I was tired of feeling so unconfident especially. Well turns out, I was right. After starting this pill, I had absolutely zero side effects at all, it didn’t make me break out, I lost 10 pounds & back to my normal weight, I feel so much more emotionally stable and normal now. Great Pill, I highly recommend for anyone struggling with cystic acne or PCOS. I promise give it a try :)",Amazing.
1,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8.0,,"July 11, 2021",0,"I began Yaz in 2019 after a doctor tried to give me a birth control that made me bleed constantly after I had a huge cyst.  They decided instead of the laproscopy more birth control changes would be cheaper. It was also not helping with cyst growth so I did my research and got a second opinion with a telephone doctor.  I got Yaz and it's helped me so much with my PCOS, my hair stopped falling out so much, weight loss became ""easier"" and I'm not bleeding constantly with severe symptoms!  It didn't matter how much pain I said I was in, that my stomach hurt, my back.  I still get pain, but it's not as extreme and I'm not crying over a rice crispies treat for no reason. Wish it did more for hirsutism.",Natali
2,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 15, 2019",21,"Yasmin (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):Yasmin (brand name only) has been a miracle drug for me. I have PCOS and when I'm not on it I gain weight, have severe acne on my back and chest, I grow excess hair on my body, I lose hair on my head, and I'm super lethargic. When I'm on Yasmin all of these symptoms go away. I will go on it again as soon as I can!",Kathy
3,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,1.0,,"February 19, 2019",9,"I was on yasmin for about 3 years which really helped with my symptoms of PCOS. For some reason my doc decided to switch me to yaz despite me telling her multiple times that I liked yasmin and that it helped me regulate (she also told me I didn't have PCOS even though I recently went to a new doc who has confirmed that I DO have PCOs).Anyways, Yaz completely messed me up, stopped getting a period first about 5 months, then started getting sick with migraines and extreme nausea. Finally I went off yaz and found a new doc to help me with the issues yaz gave me, she found that I have PCOS and put me back on yasmin. To clarify for me -  YASMIN works for PCOS, YAZ does not. They have the same hormones, but different doses.  The Yaz has less ethinyl estradiol (0.02mg) and the yasmin ahas more (0.03mg)Needless to say, I am so happy to be back on yasmin.",Toot
4,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 6, 2019",2,"I had almost lost one ovary by age 13. I’d had periods every 2 weeks that lasted up to a week each for years before that. I had a cyst on the end of my fallopian tube that had been constricting for probably a year or more. At rate I was losing eggs I’d hit menopause by 18. I was prescribed Yasmin 28. Anytime I’ve been off it I get acne and my PMDD gets worse as well as my PCOS. For my teen years I was still getting cysts just not as bad and they would ruptured before they got big. I had my first child at 19 or so. I also got pregnant only when I was off Yasmin 28 for a month insurance, orthotricyclin. I’ve been mostly cyst free for over a year & I’m 34. I have had a few when I was off Yasmin 28. I found for my body the generic for Yasmin 28, was not as helpful. As a teen it was the worst even on Yasmin 28. I do suggest this drug for pmdd and pcos. My insurance now covers it as my dr clicks preferred brand on the rx and I get a 3 month supply for like $60 on insurance.",ChristinaWNY
5,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 10, 2018",1,"Do not take this drug. It made me spacey, tired, anxious, and most of all extremely dehydrated. I could not hold onto any water and urinated large amounts every 30 minutes. As you can imagine, this has greatly interfered with my life. I constantly have dry, cracked lips and no energy. It took me years to finally figure out that this is the problem. I switched to a different pill without drospirenone, and I think I am slowly getting better. This dangerous drug should not be prescribed at all.",Anonymous
6,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 19, 2018",2,I took the generic brand from Lupin Laboratories for ovarian cyst. I did not experience nausea or headaches and it helped with the cyst. The only downside was I starting getting dark spots in face. My doctor switched me over to Migrogestin 1/20.,sanie
7,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 10, 2017",10,"I've had 2 surgeries for 2 ruptured ovarian cysts as a result of PCOS and I usually have very severe side effects to hormonal medication.  However, I did not want to experience the pain I did this last time so I found out about Yaz and decided to try it since it's anti-androgen properties could help my symptoms.  I was prescribed the generic thanks to my insurance - Nikki - and was skeptical that I would get the full benefit.WOW!  What a difference!  I'm not even thru the first pack yet and my brain fog is GONE!  My moods have evened out - I also suffer from PMDD - and I feel AMAZING!",MissLeopard83
8,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 1, 2016",2,"I was on yaz for three years. I am really torn on how I feel about it. I am an average weight non smoker. I am on birth control for ovarian cysts, not to prevent pregnancy. At first yaz was great. No periods, at all, but some bleeding after sex. I lost 10 lbs immediately, mostly just water weight, and my pms/pmdd was so much better. The negative part is the extremely painful breasts, low libido, a blood clot, binge eating, price, and eventual negative mood changes. I have finally connected yaz to two whole years of horrible light headed/dizzy spells, of which I originally blamed my antidepressant. I am now getting off of yaz to and going back on my antidepressant. I cannot yet prove it was the yaz but I do see dizziness as a side effect.",Frymommy
9,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 18, 2016",1,"I have been on Ortho Tri Cyclen for two years and rapidly gained over 15 pounds after the first year. I never felt full after a meal, and would always crave sweets. Finally, 3 months ago I decided to go on Zarah, a generic brand of Yasmin. Before I was on birth control, I was 104 pounds. 3 months ago, I was 131 pounds and started becoming very concerned about my weight. After being on Zarah for these 3 months I am now 123.0 pounds! I'm happier and less worried, and I want to lose at least 4 more pounds. This is a huge difference for me as birth control is something I need to be on to prevent any more cysts from forming. I've had two burst in less than two weeks and had to be hospitalized.",Anonymous
10,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10.0,,"July 2, 2011",50,"Yasmin (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):Well, I have had polycystic ovarian syndrome symptoms since the age of 13. When I was 18 my doctor prescribed Yasmin. Before, I was overweight, had bad acne, excessive hair growth on body and face, and was just angry/depressed. After taking Yasmin, my skin was amazing, seriously! I lost 20 pounds in 3 weeks (was active though), hair didn't grow as much, I had more energy, and I was content. The only side effect I had was a small rash on my ankle, that cleared up in 2 days.At that time, I only had a 28 day supply. I'm 26 now and haven't taken Yasmin since then. I've gained all the weight back plus more, I have way more hair growth and I'm angry and depressed all the time. I'm willing to try Yasmin again this year.",kayren
11,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,9.0,,"June 6, 2011",23,"Gianvi (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):I decided to write a review since I did not see anyone mention PCOS.  I have been on Gianvi since October 2009.  It is now June 2011.  I initially took Yaz until I was switched to the generic version, Gianvi.  Both medications have not given me any issues.  My periods are normal, no cramps (I never had any to begin with), reduced acne, and maintained weight.  I have always been an emotional person to some degree.  This hasn't seemed to increase my emotions and I do not get angry or get headaches as some as said.  My only worry is getting blood clots or DVT as I've recently read.  ",ohhhstella
12,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,9.0,,"March 23, 2011",17,"Yaz (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):I would be absolutely useless during my period and the pain from my ""episodes"", as we have come to call them, would be so bad that I would actually go into shock. I took Yaz for a little over a year and LOVED IT. My periods were nearly pain-free, my skin looked AMAZING (even though it wasn't horrible before), and I had no definite side effects. I went from needing 2 Acetaminophen and 4 Ibuprofen every four hours or a Hydrocodone (for the pain) to needing nothing! The pain had gone from unbearable to a mild discomfort. I had no change in weight, and my moods were much more stable. My only side effect was mild ""rocky"" stomach the first few days after initially starting the pill. It worked great for me.",Anonymous

14,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,5.0,,"August 11, 2010",12,"Yaz (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):I have been on Yaz for a little over a year now. My doctor put me on this pill because it is apparently a good one for PCOS. This pill did keep me from getting pregnant and helped somewhat with cramping. However, while on this pill I gained about 12 pounds and my sex drive was non-existent and I'm 21 so that's not normal. Also, while I was on Yaz my periods never came the day it was supposed to but rather the day it was suppose to end. My periods were often heavy and irregular. Before I was put on Yaz I was on Seasonique and today I am going back on that pill. I was on Seasonique for 4 years before Yaz and I never had any problems.",Anonymous
15,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10.0,,"June 18, 2010",10,"I have been on Ocella for a month and two weeks and have not experienced ANY weight gain. I was scared to hear all the negative reviews about Yasmin and Ocella and I didn't want to take it, but unfortunately I have PCOS and I had to.When my period came, I experienced extremely painful cramps, which some girls experience during that time of the week but I never have. A Pamprin solved that problem.I am nauseous a lot of the time, but it's not too debilitating, and I think it helps me eat less. I noticed my acne clear up tremendously after taking Ocella and I have regular periods again, which is a relief. Everyone has a different reaction.",Anonymous
16,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,1.0,,"January 20, 2010",9,"Yaz (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):I was on Yaz for almost 3 years. At first it REALLY helped with the symptoms of my PCOS....I had gained so much weight before starting the pill and my ache was horrible. When I got on the pill, acne went away...my weight started to slowly decrease. Now, however I've been on it for 2 years and all I can say is that it made me feel worse. My weight still has not dropped off (after diets and exercise) I got headaches and I'm always so tender now. I've developed GERD, which I never had a problem with before I started the Yaz. I recently JUST stopped taking it and now that I'm NOT on it I feel more in control over my thoughts and I started noticing roller coaster patterns in my moods from when I was on the Yaz. However I'm summing up.",0508
17,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,,,"November 6, 2009",28,"Yasmin (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):I started taking this - before I was very moody - caused a lot of fights with my boyfriend from mood swings.  I suffer from depression, PKD, POD, etc.  I took the medication and within the first month I noticed I wasn't as moody.  I'm also very overweight - lost 30 pounds first 2 months (granted I ate healthy and exercised but what a boost - POD is a heavy cause for weight gain). My hair also didn't grow as fast so I didn't have to shave as often and I was a lot happier person in the end.  I've been told to switch to another one and I'm very very hesitant too - only due to this not being recommended for kidney disease.",Anonymous

According to BlueCross, who has received tons of calls on this change, Ocella is now a brand name drug and is also non-formulary. Even though the drug worked great for me and was helpful in my treatment of PCOS, there's no way I can spend $160 for a three month supply, especially for something that used to be completely covered by insurance.",Leah77
19,Yaz 28,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,1.0,,"September 12, 2009",26,"Yaz (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):I was placed on Yaz in May and taken off of Sprintec because of extreme joint swelling.  At first, Yaz was great.  I had no complaint's the first month, then the weight gain started.  I have been 120lbs my whole adult life and went to 130lb, within days into the second pack.  By August (just months), I slipped into a depression with extreme hopelessness and could not stop crying.  I also noticed that my skin was getting oily.  I called my Doctor and they placed me back on my old pills.  Within a week, my mood has improved, I'm not crying uncontrollably and my skin is normal again.  The pharmacist stated that women either love Yaz or they hate it.  Too bad it didn't work for me, I am very glad to be off of it.",Anonymous
