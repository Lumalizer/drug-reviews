No weight gain, took away all my acne, lighter periods, and no more ovarian cysts (the reason I was prescribed this in the first place). I do sometimes feel the occasional mood swing and get very emotional. Additionally, I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life, this medication has not worsened it in my experience though. It affects everyone differently, so try it out for at least 6 months and see how you like it!",Allie

While less side effects than Tri estarylla, it was not effective for my condition. I first had a break through bleeding for 2.5 weeks with thick blood clumps and horrible cramps. It was awful! Then after the breakthrough bleeding I actually went from getting irregular periods to none at all. I made the switch however because my moods were out of control, especially anger. I did not experience weight gain or acne on this pill.",AnoNImous

5,Junel,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10.0,,"July 5, 2017",4,"I started Lo Loestrin Fe to help lessen the amount of cysts that I get on my ovaries. I had used different birth control pills in the past and had issues with mood swings, depression, and little to no sex drive so I was hesitant to get back on one. I have been on LLF now for about 3 years. It has helped drastically lower the number of cysts I get each year, although I do still get them occasionally. I had very irregular cycles before starting LLF that were light but painful and sometimes came with fevers, vomiting, and severe cramps. Since being on LLF I have had no full periods and only spotted a few times. I have seen no emotional change or acne change since starting this pill, but it may be causing a slight issue with losing weight.","Easton, Nicole"

I took myself off of the meds for about 6 months trying to rebalance my system and found a new doctor. My new doctor diagnosed me with PCOS and suggested Lo Loestrin Fe.

Didn't help with my ridiculously bad adult acne big problem. It went back to before. For a short period, I think it decreased my acne by 10%.

I have had pretty much zero side effects after a month of use. Breasts grew a little bit and were tender at first, but other then that I feel fine. I am typically hypersensitive to medicines.
