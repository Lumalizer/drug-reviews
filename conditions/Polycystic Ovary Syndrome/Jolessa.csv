0,Jolessa,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,2,,"April 7, 2020",3,"Background: 26 y/o female with PCOS since the age of 12. Been on and off 21/7 day birth controls many years. They worked fine, but with how bad my PCOS has gotten, I wanted to avoid having a period every. dang. month. so I finally found a doctor that *allowed* me to use a 84/7 pack. It is hard to get different medications at this exact point as my husband is in the military and they only dole out 1 month at a time and not a day before.I am almost done with week 7 of my first pack and I am getting bleeding on and off since week 6. I am trying to manage this problem by taking Exedrin's NSAIDs ingredient to manage the bleeding and pain. My main complaint is that the whole world is in the middle of a toilet paper crisis as it's COVID-19 time.. So if I started my period by stopping the pills and just toughed it out, I would be out of tp well before I stopped bleeding (and I JUST bought 12 rolls..) OR I have to stick it out for who knows how long (these comments have me fretting).",YeetHaw
1,Jolessa,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,1,,"December 28, 2017",3,"I was on Jolessa for 5 months. I had to stop because of the constant bleeding. I've literally been bleeding for four months. I'm depressed, sometimes have thoughts that I'm dying, feeling hopeless, have gained 13lbs that I can't seem to shake, and am exhausted. If I clean house, walk somewhere, take out the trash, the bleeding increases. My doctor put me on Beyaz a week ago, and the bleeding hasn't stopped. I'm starting to wonder if it ever will. I think Jolessa broke my uterus.",K in OK
2,Jolessa,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 27, 2012",8,"I have been on Jolessa for 41 days and for the last 16 I have been bleeding some days with terrible terrible cramping then clotting like crazy and just when I think it's over it remains and I am bleeding again. I can't wait for my appointment, I may stop before then.",TamaralnH
