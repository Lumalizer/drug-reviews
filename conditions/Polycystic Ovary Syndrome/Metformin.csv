1,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 7, 2022",0,"Started metformin over 7 weeks ago now. Starting from 500mg worked up to 2000mg. I did have side effects first 3-4 weeks, feeling nausea & upset stomach. But they went away. I've lost over 14lbs in less than a month even though I wasn't over weight to begin with, but my weight has been stable now. Only problem is I haven't had a period since starting them. My period is usually between 43-45 days. I'm nearly at 60 days, never been without a period this long! I'm starting to become quite uncomfortable. Good points is, my spots I have on my chest & back have cleared up and I haven't ever had a clear chest nor back.  I was diagnosed with PCOS at 13 years old  & I'm 29 now. My hair growth has slowed down. I also feel less tired. Before I use to have heavy eyes & felt tired throughout day, don't even have that problem no more. Only negative which I wanted most is I've had no period.Tips: Eat a HEALTHY diet, drink plenty & eat with medication it does make a big difference in side effects.",Longer cycles

10,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 22, 2021",4,"5ft 3in and my highest weight was 220lbs.  I've been struggling with PCOS since childhood.  Always struggled with weight up and down.  Had joined a gym, changed diet, and struggled to get the weight down and stay down.  Carb cravings were really bad and worse with emotional eating with no shut off.  Doctor put me on 500mg twice a day.  I started off with once a day because I wanted to step up to the full dose.  1 week in and I'm amazed.  Bloating is decreasing.  Weight is dropping.  Cravings are pretty much gone.  Before, the strong craving for carb food was like walking down a tunnel with a light on guiding me and now the cravings are almost gone but like in a fog so not really noticeable enough to act on them.  I love this medicine.  1st day was fine.  2nd day was a little nauseous.  3rd day had some bathroom issues.  4th day everything seemed to start to level off.  I'm having to make sure I eat enough calories now because my appetite is no where near where it was before.",JRez

I ended up going to the ER for possible lactic acidosis, they say it wasn’t the case but I honestly don’t believe it. I quit Metformin 3 days ago and I’m still having muscle cramps, aches and then a burning and numb sensation in my thighs.

I only have one ovary due to a dermoid cyst that cause one ovary and tube to be removed when I was 16 years old. So I figured that was the issue. But went to the doc this week and turns out I have PCOS in the one ovary I have. I'm a little over weight 170lb I would like to get back to 130 but my weight has fluctuated all over the place since I got my first period, despite not hardly eating at all. So my doc put me on metformin 500mg 1x a day and recommend a low carb whole foods diet and protein shakes during the day (since I don't usually eat until 5 or 7 at night) and to workout for 30 mins a day. Then I take clomid on day 3 of my cycle. So far no side effects really a little gas but I feel a lot better I sleep a lot better at least.

It made me feel dizzy and weak at first and also gave me diarrhea. I realized that I only get diarrhea from it when I don't have a good meal before taking it. Also I don't feel weak or dizzy from it anymore and I got my period 5 days after I started to use it. I think it works good if you take it like you are supposed to.

My doctor prescribed me 500 mg a day to start with, but for a week I cut it in half to try to lesson the side effects. Seems to have worked, because I am now up to the dose she prescribed with absolutely no side effects. I had a ton of anxiety for no reason. I eat a normal meal and then take the pill. For me I take it after dinner since I tend to skip breakfast. If you were prescribed this for PCOS, don’t be scared. Just try it. Cut your does in half if you’re like me and worry about everything.

The 3 guys outside the bathroom definitely heard what I did. They laughed at me.  My boyfriend panicked and everyone at the party wanted to know where I went It was an awful time I never want to go back. Metformin gives me the runs, but it helps regulate my periods.

I also have always had very very thick hair and I lost 40% of my hair. I realized my hair loss started a month or so after being on metformin. I mentioned it to my doctor and he disagrees with me and said my conditions cause hair loss. While I understand hypothyroid and pcos cause hair loss I never had hair loss until I took this medicine. I was diagnosed with PCOS at age 24 and hypothyroid the following year. I'm 38 now so Im not buying that it didn't cause it. Having diarrhea every day for over a year is not good for your health.

I just thought it was early menopause.  I gained 100 lbs in 2 years.

Then the second week, add the 2nd pill per day, etc. Its all about gradual adding.Per this smart doc, if you allow your body to get used to it the first week and take with food, you will be less likely to suffer the nausea, etc.Using it, I have finally had a period and my energy level has increased.

I ended up in the ER with two ruptured cysts and one the size of a baseball.  After years of feeling tired all the time and strange hairs on my breasts and random places I was finally diagnosed with PCOS.  I had also been trying to conceive for one year. My doctor started me on metformin 500mg once a day. Just 3 weeks later I conceived and 9 days after that I had a positive pregnancy test.  After a entire year of trying!!!  I feel so much better on this medicine.,Heather1989
131,Metformin,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 26, 2016",26,"I had my 14 year old daughter tested for PCOS because she had extra hair growth on her face and even though she was a very active girl, she never lost any weight. Only one hormone level came back slightly elevated, but her pediatrician still referred her to an endocrinologist. They ordered an ultrasound and sure enough, she was diagnosed with PCOS. She now takes Metformin 500mg twice daily and has lost 14 lbs since December. She hasn't suffered any side effects, thank God, but the hair growth continues. According to her doctor birth control pills will help with the hair growth, but I remain reluctant due to their side effects. We tried laser hair removal, but it's really pricey and has not helped. Any suggestions???",Mommy of PCOS
