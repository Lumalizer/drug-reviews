0,Zinc oxide topical,Dermatologic Lesion,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 11, 2021",0,"I had 3 flea bites on my lower leg and they were very itchy. I put some zinc oxide ointment on them before bed. It contained 20% zinc oxide, mineral oil and petrolatum. The next morning the bites had red striations around them that looked like broken blood vessels. I wiped off whatever ointment was left and the red marks finally dissipated over the next 4 days or so. I contacted the company to ask them if the product contained nano sized zinc. They said it didn't. I have never had a reaction to mineral oil or petrolatum so I assume it was a reaction to the zinc oxide. I won't use it again.",nettie70

3,Zinc oxide topical,Dermatologic Lesion,8,,"February 1, 2010",22,I have some facial scar tissue from a dog bite and it is generally looks reddish. I also have allergies to fragrances and I have very sensitive skin. A friend suggested that I try zinc oxide to reduce the redness and it has worked tremendously for me.  I use it around my nose and chin area and I thing the scar tissue looks minimal and the redness is much less.  I am using it nightly now.,Anonymous
