2,Methylprednisolone,Dermatologic Lesion,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 5, 2019",10,I was prescribed a blister pack for severe poison oak. It immediately started clearing up and I felt relief within two days. I did not finish the full course because it was giving me really frequent heart palpitations which was concerning.,el
3,Methylprednisolone,Dermatologic Lesion,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 15, 2017",9,"I was prescribed this in the ER for ulcers on my skin. Please, as I write this and am struggling with this. Do not take this drug. I was acting not myself for the time on it. I thought it was my anxiety disorder. After day 5 I fell into a deep depression, I have had panic attacks, severe confusion, I've debated if I loved anyone. And cried and have screamed because I was having thoughts about my significant other. I couldn't and am still struggling to go outside. I can't get out of bed. They wanted me on antidepressants and high dosages of anxiety meds. I saw a Dr at urgent care and they asked who was stupid enough to prescribe you this and why. I'm hoping all these feelings and emotions are from this drug. I haven't been myself since.",Anonymous
4,Methylprednisolone,Dermatologic Lesion,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 9, 2016",5,"My skin dermatoligist prescribed me this drug to heal inflammation on the skin that was caused by mosquitos and left blisters & deep wounds on my skin. She prescribed me methylprednisolone 8mg which I had to take 3x a day for 3 days... I had the whooping cough at the same time when I took this drug, I took Ambroxol before that but stopped when I took this drug. The pill did nothing much to me. I took it 2 times and then I stopped due to the side effects. After the pills my throat does not swallow properly and spitting out thick phlegm is difficult, I almost choked and was out of breath from my own phlegm when I tried to spit it out. It only stopped the pain in my leg but caused pain at other parts of my body. Not taking them again.",D2daC
