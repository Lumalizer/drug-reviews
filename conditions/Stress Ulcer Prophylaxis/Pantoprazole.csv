0,Pantoprazole,Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 19, 2021",6,"I've been taking Pantoprazole for 2 months and I feel absolutely awful. Nausea, lack of appetite, dizziness, crying and pain attacks. I didn't feel this bad before I started taking them.I went to the A&E department just yesterday and explained my symptoms.  She doubled my dose! I'm already taking 20mg twice a day and she advised 40mg twice a day. I don't plan on taking these and will finish my packet of 20mg (only 4 left) I would strongly advise anyone who is thinking of taking Pantoprazole to reconsider.",Lorriecan
1,Pantoprazole,Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis,1,,"November 21, 2020",3,pantoprazole is not a good drug. Worst side effects ever.  Makes life Horrible. My whole week useless thanks to this. It did help with the acid reflux but the side effects and withdrawal symptoms are nasty,Anonymous
2,Pantoprazole,Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis,2,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 13, 2019",11,"I started on 40 mg of Pantoprazole a couple of years ago because of severe acid reflux.  I was getting a bad cough because of acid going into my lungs.  The drug worked very well.  But just lately I read some research that PPIs greatly increase the chances of heart attack, so I quit taking it.  Well, after just one day the acid reflux was back with a vengeance and I soon started getting lung problems again.  It seems that stopping this medication makes the original problem worse.  I'm back on it again to stop the pain but I'm going to see my doctor to see what can be done.  I rated it a 2 because it does work, but it also makes the problem worse and very likely kills you early.",Buddha192
