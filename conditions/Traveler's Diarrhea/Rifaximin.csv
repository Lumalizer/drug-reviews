0,Rifaximin,Traveler's Diarrhea,9,,"November 22, 2011",48,"Xifaxan (rifaximin):Returned from a trip to Kenya, Africa and brought back an unexpected guest which caused my diarrhea for two weeks.  Tried the usual antibiotic regimen along with Questran, neither of which worked with total success.  Tried Xifaxan in combination with Probiotics and the cure was virtually overnight.  I will definitely remember this and refer to anyone I know with similar problem.",Anonymous

I was careful what I ate but got sick before we left the restaurant. 3 weeks of misery, called the doctor, got rifaximin, and was feeling 90% improved by second day of treatment.  Amazing-amazing-amazing drug!",anonemouse
