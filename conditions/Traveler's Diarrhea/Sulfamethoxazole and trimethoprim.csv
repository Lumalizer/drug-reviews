I decided to stop the medication immediately.",Rollie
2,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Traveler's Diarrhea,10,,"April 16, 2016",3,I've had a stomach disorder for two months. After several trips to the doc someone finally gave me this. I have had no side effects other then breathing heavy a little. But it rid me of what ever bacteria I had causing severe intestinal pain and massively messed up bowels. This helped in the first day. I was exposed to stagnant water. But it does say not work for some people. I would say if you had negative effects stop taking it. But it does work in the right situation.  I can't believe I can eat food again.,Dougarhia
