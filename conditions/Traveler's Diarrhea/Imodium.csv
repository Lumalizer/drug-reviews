0,Imodium,Traveler's Diarrhea,10,,"June 11, 2015",32,"I had loose almost diarrhea stools for almost three months after a trip to Florida.  I began to seriously worry, so before going to a doctor took a dose (2 pills) of Imodium.  I returned to normal in 2 days and have had no problem since.  One dose fixed a 3 month long problem!  Read the directions.  It said to take a second dose after a second event of loose stools.  I might have taken another dose that night after the first if I had read read the instructions carefully.  I suspect some of the reviewers who had stomach pains might have done that, because I had NO discomfort.  Just an almost miraculous immediate return to normal movements.  Thank you makers!",Carrell Photographer
