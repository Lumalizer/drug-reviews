0,Imodium A-D,Traveler's Diarrhea,10,,"December 8, 2019",6,"I just got back from Mexico 12/07/19 and would not have been able to board the plane if it were not for Imodium A-D. It absolutely saved my ass! I do not understand these complaints about packaging though it's quite simple, peel back paper cover and pop the thing through.  The packaging matters very little to me considering I would still be in Mexico if it were not for this medication. THANK YOU!!! from the bottom of my bowels.",Very Pleased
