0,Xifaxan,Traveler's Diarrhea,9,,"November 22, 2011",48,"Returned from a trip to Kenya, Africa and brought back an unexpected guest which caused my diarrhea for two weeks.  Tried the usual antibiotic regimen along with Questran, neither of which worked with total success.  Tried Xifaxan in combination with Probiotics and the cure was virtually overnight.  I will definitely remember this and refer to anyone I know with similar problem.",Anonymous
