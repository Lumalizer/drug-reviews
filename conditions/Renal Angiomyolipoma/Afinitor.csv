0,Afinitor,Renal Angiomyolipoma,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 8, 2018",7,I had my left kidney removed June 2016 and part of my left lung as it had metas. I was on Sutent and very ill and on another drug that did not work. So far this is helping to shrink my tumors in my lungs. The only side effect is a slight cough and some fatigue. Our family almost can not afford my drugs. So I have to change to the cheap generic drugs,Dsingh1900
