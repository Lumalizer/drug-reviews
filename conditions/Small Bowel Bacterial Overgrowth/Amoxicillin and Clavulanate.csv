0,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Small Bowel Bacterial Overgrowth,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2022",0,"I'm taking this medicine for SIBO. This is the third day of me taking it and I'm experiencing diarrhea every morning. It kinda of helps my symptoms since I constantly have constipation and excessive gas.  Before taking this medication, I usually need to take fiber to help me with my bowel movement.  Lets' see whether it can eventually help with my gas too!",jade
1,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Small Bowel Bacterial Overgrowth,8.0,,"August 6, 2019",10,"I used this for a pretty extreme bout of SIBO. GI had me take a breath test and the results were pretty high. I felt a million times better day 2 of this medication, though it did cause diarrhea. Unfortunately I’m having a second comeback of my SIBO. I was prescribed this again but I’m holding out a few days and trying to see if my current diet will help. If I’m not feeling better in a day or so or I’m worse I will resort to antibiotics again. I feel like this is a temporary cure and not a long term solution.",Anonymous
2,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Small Bowel Bacterial Overgrowth,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 30, 2019",19,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):I took Augmentin for a second episode of diverticulitis. The first time around (two years ago)  I took  Cipro and Flagyl which felt like a controlled forest burn of my intestines. Augmentin was MUCH easier to tolerate. I second those who’ve suggested taking it with probiotics. This makes all the difference. I took one or two probiotics about 2 hours before and also 2 hours after each dose. Definitely take it with a large snack or meal. Experienced only some mild indigestion about 30 minutes after taking it. My symptoms started improving around day 3 with continued improvement. For probiotics, I took a broad spectrum one with multiple strains plus a high powered version of Florastor. I was terrrified of taking Augmentin after reading all the reviews but dove in with the proper supports because there was no way I was going back to the Cipro combo. Good luck and I hope it works for you!",R.

4,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Small Bowel Bacterial Overgrowth,,,"December 26, 2017",3,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):After two years of very helpful regiments of xifaxin my insurance will no longer cover it. My gastro wants me to take augmentin, back to square one. She must have forgotten that before the xifaxin I took augmentin and my symptoms would worsen with higher levels of bacteria that would spread. No No No!",Sadder

6,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Small Bowel Bacterial Overgrowth,10.0,,"January 13, 2015",18,"I was prescribed Amox Clave 850 mg for Bronchitis. I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Diarrhea. After just a day or two of the medication my diarrhea was gone, totally! I know this is probably a temporary fix, but its been 3 weeks and I still feel fantastic. My Doctor was surprised as Amox Clave usually has the opposite effect on patients but not for me, MIRACLE! I have done all of the traditional suggestions, Fod Map Diet, Lactose and Gluten free but nothing has worked like this medication.",SO CAL LK
7,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Small Bowel Bacterial Overgrowth,1.0,,"February 16, 2011",16,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):This medicine was given as an alternative to Xifaxan because my insurance won't cover Xifaxan. My Doctor says there is a 60% chance it will work. I am on Day 5 of 10 and have seen no results as of yet with no relief of my symptoms. Side effects the first couple of days were brutal, I think my body has begun to adjust now.",Anonymous
