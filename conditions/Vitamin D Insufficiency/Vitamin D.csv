1,Vitamin D,Vitamin D Insufficiency,1,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 29, 2021",16,"I began taking this supplement 4 years ago when I was told my levels were too low. I began having hypothyroid symptoms within months. Hair loss, dry hair and skin, achy joints, migraines. But my levels were all normal. On a whim, I recently stopped taking the vitamin d and my symptoms have all disappeared! Every doctor I saw kept saying it wasn't the supplement. I am so frustrated that there is relatively no information about it causing more issues in some people such as myself.",Frustrated
