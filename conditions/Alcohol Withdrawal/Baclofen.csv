0,Baclofen,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 24, 2020",18,"Hello Friends, I do believe that this baclofen is a game changer for alcohol problems! I have been on Baclofen for 6 months now and have gone from a bottle a day down to only a few mini bottles every few days. Sure I still have a beer or two in between but I feel so much better and get so much more done daily. When I first heard the ad on the radio I was all over it because of how much money I was spending at bars and on bottles daily. (about $300 just on the weekends). I recommend this to anyone that get anxiety from not having drinks especially if they go a day with out drinking. Give it some time and let it work and you will be just as happy as I am",Roadrunner
1,Baclofen,Alcohol Withdrawal,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 17, 2020",34,"Severe alcoholism for over a decade. Tried everything to stop. Started to take this in the morning instead of the first drink. Reduced w/d symptoms: sweating, anxiety, obsessive thoughts about drinking, tachycardia.It took a a year or so of using baclofen while working hard to reduce drinking, but when I was ready, it gave me the ability to stop. It treated a host of related problems: panic, tremors from drinking for so long and the embarrassment that comes from that, balancing mood since it helped calm the mind, neuropathy from likely nerve damage, spasms, PTSD. Very dangerous to mix this with alcohol, so if you are not able to control yourself from mixing them to get an exaggerated alcohol effect, don't use it. I  think the desire to quit or reduce was essential to its effectiveness. It worked for me the way naltrexone is supposed to. But without the anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure in normally pleasurable activities). I still get anhedonia occasionally, but on naltrexone, it was constant.",Courtney
2,Baclofen,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 2, 2020",37,I have been on Baclofen for 2 months now to help me stop drinking and started at 5mg and SLOWLY titrated up. I’m now on 60mg and have no desire to drink. If I’m at a social event I’ll have a glass of wine but I drink it very slowly and most of the time don’t finish it which was highly unusual for me. If I started a glass of wine I would always end up drinking 4 glasses. Baclofen is the best thing that ever happened to me.,Uniden

At 60 mg I was nauseous, dizzy, and felt like I was kind of losing my mind. It definitely took away cravings though, but so not worth it if you can’t even function, bed-ridden. I’m on Naltrexone now  which seems to be working and there are no side-effects, so I’m going to stick with that and hope the extinction effect will help me control my drinking.",Acga

9,Baclofen,Alcohol Withdrawal,,,"October 25, 2019",64,"Having Acquired brain injury (ABI) and P.T.S.D made my drinking behavior very destructive to self and others. Booze made my depression go for a few hours and made me feel happy again, but its short lived, because in the morning when you are dehydrated, the paranoia and agitation, twitching and moods are very bad. Then I would drink again to fix it. But this is all wrong for me and others. I think if that doctor had not given me Baclofen for my  A.B.I. problems ten years ago, I would be dead by now. Now if I stop taking baclofen, the alcohol cravings return in a weeks, they are very over powering. If I crave alcohol now, it now means that I've forgotten to take my baclofen. End note, baclofen helped me stay a functional individual in society and a healthier War pensioner and Veteran. What a blessing. Lucky the War Pension pays for the medication too. ACE",Barruk Hashem

11,Baclofen,Alcohol Withdrawal,9.0,,"September 6, 2019",112,"I was prescribed 20 mg baclofen as needed  2 years ago for back pain (muscle spasms) and it works great for me for that purpose. I only needed it occasionally when my back pain would flair up....Here’s the amazing part- I stopped drinking (again) 10 days ago. I started exercising more. I experienced some back pain. So, I took a baclofen once a day for 2-3 days. I realized with NO prompting whatsoever that my alcohol cravings mellowed substantially!I had never heard of that wonderful reaction until I googled it today. I am thrilled!I personally don’t need large doses. 20 mg once a day (at most) is effective for me.With the exception of a few breaks, I was consuming anywhere from 4-20 beers a day for 15 years.... binging for 2-3 days at a time, and drinking vodka for breakfast.Maybe you will have a good result with a small dosage. It is certainly worth trying.",Hope
12,Baclofen,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,,"July 10, 2019",95,"Baclofen saved my life and helped me successfully withdraw from benzodiazepines, opiates AND gabapentin.  I am now 23 days clean from a 14-month 2 mg/day clonazepam habit.  I rapidly tapered down to 0.5 mg for a few days and made the jump cold turkey.  I think the more prudent thing to do here is a slow, longer taper, but I wanted to rip the band-aid off and start healing.  For 2 weeks, I experienced a lot of bad symptoms.  It was scary.  But during this time, I took very high doses of Baclofen (up to 200 mg/day), and believe it or not, I actually got some sleep.  In the beginning it was just cat naps, but gradually I slept more and more, and now I am sleeping 6-7 hours per night and have energy throughout the day.  As a matter of fact, I'm exercising at the gym and even started martial arts!  I am not going to say it was fun, but the Baclofen somehow kept the physical withdrawals in check long enough until the clouds broke...and the sun began to shine again.  You can do it too!!!",TexasJay7
13,Baclofen,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 4, 2019",31,Baclofen is amazing for benzo withdrawal. It simply removes all the anxiety and depression that comes with any benzo withdrawals. You need to get to at least 30-60mg though.Baclofen should revolutionise the benzo withdrawal or recovery treatment.

My doc was willing to give me very high dose of baclofen. This is just a miracle... craving almost done... not even willing to get one tiny shoot of vodka just for the buzz.

18,Baclofen,Alcohol Withdrawal,1.0,,"October 10, 2018",25,"Tried it for several months. As dose increased to 40, 40, 30, I experienced severe twitching one day which culminated in convulsions when asleep  which I have never had before. It was terrifying. I had been following strict  Dr's orders and increasing doses over long periods when symptoms lessened. I believe I experienced severe baclofen toxicity which if you research you will see that it is becoming a common life threatening side effect of high dose baclofen. I would not recommend this therapy. ",Dora

Without me even mentioning anything he told me he could cure me, and wrote me a prescription for Baclofen and B1 shots.Needless to say here I am a month and a half without a drink, and I feel enjoyment in things again. My anxiety is gone, my senses are back to normal, my circulation is normal,  and my constant 'fight or flight' mechanism that I've had my entire life is turned off.

You must fight through the side effects (sleepiness, lethargy, etc) as it will eventually work.  I now take it five times/ day total 225mg but will slowly reduce now that have reached 'threshold' (Amiesen).    I had tried years of AA, rehab, moving to alcohol free countries, yoga, meditation, extreme fitness routines, years of therapy; nothing worked.    Several DUIs, lost jobs, marriages, relationships..  And then, Baclofen!   Thank you Dr. Amiesen,, I love you!",former drunk
51,Baclofen,Alcohol Withdrawal,8.0,,"January 2, 2016",55,I hadvery unpleasant side-effects but persevered because I was desperate to stop drinking.  Started on low dose Sept 2014 and built it up till I stopped drinking altogether - effortlessly - 11 Dec 2014.  I have not taken Baclofen since then (though strongly advise to reduce dose gradually as withdrawal symptoms extremely unpleasant and dangerous) and have had no desire to drink since - just relief that I am free of this addiction!  If this treatment could be recognised and prescribed in the UK it would save much suffering but it is a very powerful drug and should be used with care.,Dankbaarheid

Has stopped me drinking 1- 2 bottles white wine every second day. Can choose to drink occasionally socially if I want. Clearer calmer mind and less general body aches and pains. No more need for daily panadol. My doctor is monitoring my progress closely and I am generally happier calmer and more confident in achieving a healthier lifestyle in time. It is all so amazing not to have to fight that craving which I always gave into to calm my mind. Giving into it would make me sick every day. No more drunk means no more sick hangover.

Was prescribed Baclofen for the muscle spasm/to help healing, but its major benefit was in the control of the shakes and sweats I normally get when I sober up at the end of a binge. I could barely write my name on the doctor's form before taking this, afterwards the shakes and sweats were almost totally gone. I took one more 10mg pill before bed and slept soundly for 10 hours straight (normally I get persecution dreams and wake with leg/arm kicks, or just lie there in a pool of sweat). This ought to be prescribed for alcohol withdrawal as a matter of course.

She referred me to the only psychiatrist/doctor in my county who was allowed to prescribe Baclofen for alcohol. After being an alcoholic for sixteen years, and having tried everything available to stop drinking, I can tell you that I have now been alcohol free for five and a half years. This is a miracle drug. What I find inexplicable, is the fact that only people who do their own research, find out about this drug, and have to ask for it. With alcoholism such a massive problem world-wide, why is this drug not the standard treatment. I fear the government stands to lose too much in taxes if people could stop drinking so easily.",Tyneparker

I stopped three days ago and was worried I would have severe withdrawals however since taking Baclofen I have been absolutely fine (started on a dose of 10mg and gone up to 30mg but this depends on your dependency on alcohol). I have been thinking of alcohol lots which is expected but I'm been sleeping better than when I do drink (as I normally wake up at 3am with extreme anxiety or worries in my life) and now don't feel any anxiety. I'm determined to stay on this path and feel proud of myself already. I would recommend study on the web and look at all sorts of alternatives remedies.,Sue2014

After two months of serious binge drinking, I ended up in A&E when I decided to detox once again without any suitable medication support. They provided me Diazepam and I cleaned up again, but it only lasted for three months. The vicious circle is much harder to break as you get older. However, now, on Baclofen, I feel a tremendous improvement and do not feel the urge to drink. Indeed, the medicine worked amazingly well from the very beginning of the treatment.
