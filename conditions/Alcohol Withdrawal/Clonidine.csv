0,Clonidine,Alcohol Withdrawal,4.0,,"March 6, 2021",3,"I started to take Clonidine for alcohol withdrawal.  It worked very well.  I ended staying on it for two years for sleeping.  What I noticed is that now it is causing me lots of problems. I cannot take it anymore.  I had lots of extras and started to take an extra one a day for anxiety.  It just made my anxiety even worse.  I was not sure that it was the Clonidine that was causing some pretty bad side effects.  Depression, irritability, shaking, stress, changes in thinking, vision changes, general unwell feeling. For me it was tolerable but for some reason I cannot take it anymore. Be careful on increase dosing as a small dose 0.1 was not giving me many problems.  I cannot even tolerate alcohol anymore. My body is basically rejecting all drugs Most problems people have can be solved with changing your diet to a fruit and vegetable base. Juicing is a extremely powerful healer as there are so many stories about how people have reversed just about everything with juice alone.",Keith
1,Clonidine,Alcohol Withdrawal,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 26, 2020",6,"I was prescribed clonidine .25mg. I had no side affects. It did help with alcohol cravings, but I still could not keep any alcohol in the house. So doing both helped. I could I had more energy and I my head felt clear. The only thing is I think I might be gaining weight. About 5 pounds in 2 weeks.",Sky
2,Clonidine,Alcohol Withdrawal,,,"March 15, 2020",5,I'm getting a little worried about withdrawals. I was sober for 3 years and I started again a year ago and my intake is going to blow 4 pints of 70 proof a day. I'm not under any medication. I went to the hospital twice they send me away because of my health insurance got shut off and it is the weekend so I can't do anything about it till this week. I could keep maintaining but with my living situation I'm not allowed to.,Sevexxx
3,Clonidine,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,,"February 22, 2020",16,"Clonidine has helped stop heavy alcohol consumption cravings and anxiety. Since starting clonidine 0.1 mg 2-3 times daily, I don't crave alcohol at all and my focus is much better.",Anonymous
4,Clonidine,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 31, 2019",23,"I started taking clonidine after my last alcohol binge.  I was in the hospital for 5 days after having suffered from 2 gran mal seizures from withdrawal.  I normally suffer from severe anxiety and insomnia and alcohol unfortunately became my coping mechanism.  To the point of near death in excess of 50 times. My doctor wouldn't prescribe me anything that worked for my anxiety and out of desperation to not be tempted to drink again I did some research and found a new, better doctor.  He didn't want to prescribe a benzo so he recommended this.  At first it didn't seem to being doing anything.  My heart was still beating fast and anxiety high, but after a couple weeks it started to work and has helped me tremendously.  It keeps me calm and my heart is not 'beating out my chest'. My blood pressure and heart rate are perfect!   I am able to sleep most nights and I don't feel so restless and anxious at all.  And I don't feel the need to drink!",CLS
5,Clonidine,Alcohol Withdrawal,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 1, 2014",15,"I guess I'm the party-pooper here, but I find clonidine didn't do anything for withdrawal. It just made me feel cold (ice cold), weak, totally drained of energy. Like a sick, anemic feeling. Yeah, it'd make me tired but not in a good way like Libirum or Ativan. I haven't drank any alcohol in 12  years now, and as I recall it was Ativan that brought me down easy that last time. ",Working man
6,Clonidine,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 10, 2014",75,"It is not an overstatement to say that clonidine probably saved my life.  I drank very heavily through most of my twenties.  By the time I was 29, I was up to over a fifth of 80 proof a day, if not more.  I would drink as much as I physically could, basically. I also drank so heavily because I have always had panic attacks and anxiety and the alcohol helped calm my nerves, until I woke up, and it was much worse, and the cycle continued.  I tried to quit other ways, but the withdrawal was too much.  I was honest with my psychiatrist and she put me on Valium and clonidine.  I tried a benzo alone, but it wasn't enough to stop the agitation.  The combination made it more bearable.  I took it day by day and now am sober going on 2 years.",Donald408
7,Clonidine,Alcohol Withdrawal,8.0,,"December 13, 2013",56,"Catapres (clonidine):Clonidine (Catapres) works great for the hypertension, cold and hot sweats/flashes, headache and overall agitation when undergoing ethanol/alcohol withdrawals. 0.1mg 3 times daily in conjuction with a benzodiazepine like chlordiazepoxide (Librium) or diazepam (Valium) may be needed depending on alcohol intake or the degree of withdrawal symptoms. Remember always be honest with your M.D. put pride aside because most likely it isn't anything he/she hasn't heard before.",Bullseye barfly
