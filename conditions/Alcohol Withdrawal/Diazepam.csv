1,Diazepam,Alcohol Withdrawal,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2021",1,Valium (diazepam):I used Valium 10 mg about 6 times to get off alcohol but I know it’s just as bad to get off benzos so I’d stop taking it after a month or so. I relapsed about 8 times and now have the beginning stages of cirrhosis. That’s what it took for me to stop. Valium is good for the withdrawal symptoms but I wouldn’t recommend long term use.,Pamela L
2,Diazepam,Alcohol Withdrawal,,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 13, 2021",0,"This is only day one of diazepam detox. I’ve been a nightly heavy drinker for many years. I’m only being given 5 doses. The first was at 1pm, second at 4pm and third dose of 10mg at 6pm and another 5mg at bedtime. I don’t understand why the doses are so small. I’m F55 of average build. As my drink time approaches I’m feeling very nervous. I feel I could still drink on it, but know better not to! Detox is only for 5 days, after which I will have no access to this medication.",A66

7,Diazepam,Alcohol Withdrawal,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 29, 2020",3,"I was given diazepam for severe alcohol withdrawal. It was given to me in quite large amounts as I was having hallucinations, severe anxiety and I was dehydrated from sweating. It did stop all of the above and I felt a lot calmer. I was tapered off over a period of 4 days. My body felt like it had been run over but I was alive. Thankfully. This drug really helped.",Mspixie 76

9,Diazepam,Alcohol Withdrawal,7.0,,"April 20, 2020",34,Valium (diazepam):Valium is great to come off alcohol or any drug however you do not want to take this for more than 10 days. See therapy to sort out the real reasons your masking your hidden troubles to become FREE. Valium is a DANGEROUS ADDICTIVE drug once you have been on it more than 3/4 weeks.  You will only be left with your stuff to be dealt with. Short term .,With it
10,Diazepam,Alcohol Withdrawal,9.0,,"January 26, 2020",8,"I’ve been on Diazepam for a couple of days now while I am detoxing from alcohol. I only experienced mild/moderate withdrawal symptoms so it’s safe for me to detox at home on a medication schedule to ease withdrawal symptoms. I’m taking 10mg every 6 hours and will then begin to taper off it after a few days. It’s been a godsend in that the anxiety, palpitations, shaking/tremors and agitation has gone away, but as many others mentioned, it makes me drowsy after I’ve taken my dose. I can still go about my day doing housework or cooking food, but I feel kind of floaty & drowsy while I do. I can’t work while I’m detoxing and taking Valium, because I wouldn’t feel safe to drive. However, by the time I’m due for my next dose the drowsiness has pretty much subsided. I think that the only withdrawal symptoms it hasn’t helped with is sweating, however it is also the middle of summer so it’s hard to tell if it’s withdrawal or the humidity!!",Cassper

13,Diazepam,Alcohol Withdrawal,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 26, 2019",14,"I have some problems with alcohol mainly because I use it to relax myself as I have a history of anxiety since being a little kid. When I start to drink I drink every night quite heavily then pass out & after a month or so of this I start to get awful withdrawal during the daytime with symptoms like depression, bad anxiety, depersonalization, panic, sweating, really fast heart rate. Just awful symptoms which my doctor said is alcohol withdrawal so he's put me on 5mg of Diazepam 3x a day & it's been great not felt the need to drink alcohol. I do realize I'm basically swapping one substance for another but I plan to not take anything soon. Good luck anxiety is a real pain your not alone.",Gary

Was a life-saver for me as before I booked the appointment I considered more alcohol as I couldn’t handle the fear, weird heart rate and constant tremors. At its peak the symptoms and anxiety combined made me feel like I was going to die.",BAH
18,Diazepam,Alcohol Withdrawal,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 11, 2019",10,I wanted to reduce my daily drinking so I decided to swap out the alcohol with diazepam every other day. I need something at night to calm me down and drinking every day was a bad idea. So every other day I don't drink and instead take 5 mg diazepam. I'm able to fall asleep and don't miss the booze on the days I take it. Too much of anything is a bad thing and this way I spread my risk.,calmest

21,Diazepam,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 29, 2018",4,"Had to go to an inpatient hospital stay because of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.after 10 days of treatment, coupled with vitamin B-complex for repairing the damage alcoholism caused, I was released completely 'cured'; no shakes, no sweating, and I was thinking more clearly. It was as effective as an antiviral medicine for a Flu.A problem might be with taking the medication properly. Because I was inpatient I didn't have to worry about dosing, remembering when to take it etc. Treatment for alcohol withdrawal syndrome has to be with help of someone other, because a patient is very disoriented and confused.",R. M.
22,Diazepam,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 23, 2018",30,"Valium (diazepam):Valium has been a God-send for my benzodiazepine taper. On it a Month now as of March 22,2018. It is very relaxing and mild now but at first it was very sedating for the first 5 days. I take 10mg 2x's a day. I am being tapered off of Klonopin after 12 years on that drug. K-pin is HELL to get off of alone. Glad my psych doc is open minded and dropped the k-pin immediately and switched me to Valium, after I told him about the Ashton Taper Method, and that I wanted off the Klonopin because it was giving me bad withdrawals if I missed a dose. If you are serious about getting off of benzos I URGE you to google the Ashton Taper Method.",StayHopeful
23,Diazepam,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,,"January 10, 2018",10,"Went cold turkey coming off alcohol and I had to go to hospital for withdrawal. They gave me Valium there and it helped a great deal.Relapsed again last month and decided to stop again as it's ruining my life. Tried to cut down on alcohol slowly but it wasn't working so stopped drinking one day and started getting the shakes and my heart rate went right up, I had to have wine and it went back to normal. Went to the doctors and explained I wanted to stop drinking, he gave me Valium to take so I could stop right then. What a god send. Took two last night and slept through the night without waking up with the sweats or shakes. Not needed to take any throughout today but will probably have one tonight to be safe from seizures.",Semple
