0,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 18, 2021",4,"Every time I tried to detox from alcohol before taking gabapentin, my nerves would feel like lightning+fire and all my muscles would feel tense while anxiety and irritability ruled my mood. I would sometimes deal with that detox but usually not for long. Without gabapentin I was struggling to even get sober, let alone stay that way.Gabapentin didn't get rid of my alcohol cravings long term by helping me break lifestyle habits or by addressing what was wrong in my life that made me want to drink, but it got rid of short term detox symptoms well enough to where I could make enough progress on long term craving causes.I tapered off gabapentin after a few months because it was having a mild but noticeable and increasing negative effect on sex drive, and I didn't like how it made my vision blur just a tiny bit.I'm about 40 years old and 185 lb and took 200 mg 3x per day.",Austin
1,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2021",6,"I had been drinking 4-6 drinks every night and binge drinking even more on the weekends for about 3 years due to situational stress/anxiety. When I tried to stop recently, I'd try to just have one but would sneakily chug 6 instead before I could curb the impulse. I was having regular hangovers, mood swings and difficulty focusing. This was concerning so I asked my psychiatrist what I should do. He told me to take 200mg of gabapentin before bed (when I would usually binge) and to reduce my alcohol consumption to 2 light beers per night, then only 1 per night until I can go with just having one or two once in awhile. So far, it's worked! I don't crave more and more booze when I take the gabapentin. Drinking one beer feels just fine and I'm able to go without drinking at all if I want.I'd recommend giving it a go if you have a doctor who can recommend the right dose for you. The only side effect I have is morning drowsiness and some weirdly elaborate dreams at night.",Anonymous
2,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,,"August 5, 2021",15,"I was drinking about a 750ml a night and then a couple quarts on the weekend. I had 4 seizures due to alcohol withdrawal, have been in detox 4 times, hospitalized a bunch and had severe liver Cirrhosis and kidney failure. I tried naltrexone but just kept drinking, tried therapy, anti-depressants, and some AA meetings but nothing helped. When not intoxicated I had horrible anxiety, insomnia, depression and thought about killing myself. I drank not to feel happy but to basically survive. I finally saw an amazing compassionate doctor during my latest hospitalization from withdrawal. He prescribed me gabapentin and have been sober 6 months. Gabapentin has changed my life. I never thought I could go this long without drinking. I take it 3 times a day at 300mg and I’m ridiculously happy. My anxiety is basically gone and I can sleep again. I feel almost normal is social situations. Gone is the feeling of impending doom. I would highly recommend this to anyone, it was a miracle drug for me.",Freedom

It's odd: it does have an anxiolytic effect (not as much as the benzos), but it takes away the cravings (and I mean it REALLY takes them away).

4,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 11, 2021",17,"I got gabapentin after a binge episode that landed me in the hospital. It worked immediately at a low dose. No thoughts of drinking. I would typically binge on 24 tall cans a day. After three days of this medication, I've had one beer, and I think it will be my last - and my home is fully stocked to the point I could destroy myself. It just works.

6,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,,"January 19, 2021",76,"Started off innocently enough by just having a few beers on the weekend with my under age pals in the basement playing pool. Four decades later, was jugging vodka all day and messed up my bp and heart rate. Was 170 over 110 and bpm of 120 while resting. Ambulance took me to the hospital twice for chest pain. Went to get help for my alcohol issues a few months back. Was put on gabapentin 300 mg per day with a schedule to increase to 1800mg over the day.  Believe it or not, I felt better day one and quit booze by day three with no wicked withdrawal or the usual cravings. I had tried to quit a zillion times before. My mind feels like I am 25 again. Please see your doctor!  You do not need to live recklessly and damage your health and relationships further. I was spending 6 to 7 hundred a month for vodka.  Now, well after Covid, I am going to take 3 vacations a year with the money I will save. Good luck all!  Also I almost forgot to add Once on gabapentin my bp and heart rate  went from 170 over 110, 120 heart rate resting to 118 over 88 and 66 heart rate resting.  No more chest pain and trips to the hospital. Call your doctor or a rehab facility.  I went to a confidential regional clinic. I was on course for a heart attack.",Finally Free
7,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,,"December 28, 2020",35,"I am only a few days into my abstinence from alcohol, but I'm beyond thrilled/baffled that I'm here at all.    I was drinking nearly a bottle of wine at night to soothe stress and anxiety, but the fall out was mood swings and hang-overs.    I read in an article how gabapentin  helped with alcohol withdrawal and/or cravings. By way of experiment, I tried it, and as if by magic, I had no cravings for drinking.    Gabapentin seems like a miracle drug to me. It truly is the game-changer I never even imagined existed. If you're looking to quit or reduce your alcohol dependence, try it. You'll be dazzled.    Suddenly, I feel so much more positive about myself and my future. Good luck and power to you all.","Caution, but Thrilled"

9,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,,"October 2, 2020",78,"I have been drinking a bottle of alcohol every day from the time I woke up so the time I went to sleep, and that is for over 20 years. If I didn't have a drink by noon I would go into withdrawal. My wife would have to go to the store for me right away because of my shakes were so bad I couldn't even get the ATM card in the machine. Last year I was shot in the neck and back and this is one of the many medication I would prescribed. I put it to the side and I've never touched it although they send it to me in the mail for a month every month for a year. I just stuck to drinking. I decided to Google it and notice it works for alcohol withdrawal. So I decided to give it a try. The first day I didn't even have a drink with no withdrawals. It's been a month now and haven't touched a drink. I highly recommend this for anybody that wants to get off alcohol.",Danny

Introduced to it when I went in to detox and 28-day rehab. Had dual diagnosis alcohol abuse/anxiety. I could not believe that I would ever quit my daily heavy wine drinking for 20+ years but here I am and so happy, proud and truly know gabapentin got me sober and no cravings ever after 2 years.

I believe I have hereditary AUD and have been a strong with my alcohol intake for roughly 15 years. My psychiatrist recommended the doses of 900 3x/ day. I take only 300 at around the typical time I would have a drink and it really does work. I tried the full recommendation of dose but The side effects where to powerful... sleepiness being a major one and not being able to sleep a full cycle at night. I find 30mg at dinner time is good for me, along with some will power. I’m sensitive to medication also so it will be different for everyone. Give it a try it does work.",Anonymous
13,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,,"July 26, 2020",43,"Not alcohol withdrawal, Abuse. I've lived with having to argue with myself every day saying ""Don't drink today"" "" I must not drink today"" my days were consumed with me arguing with myself and not having the mental band width to deal with other things. and of course I mostly lost the arguments to not drink. Until.... until Gabapentin. I started taking it 6 weeks ago for nerve pain. I denounce any doctor that does not offer this to any patient that they suspect alcohol abuse, as gabapentin is MAGIC. I still argue with myself to not drink but I have begun to realize it is just a 50 year old habit. I have no desire to drink. NONE... I did however go out shooting pool with my son and friends and had a beer just one beer with my son and friends, was fantastic.  If you drink and hate yourself half as much as I did, you must try gabapentin for your problem - it is magic, pure and simple.

I didn't know this medication has proven, in some people, to be an effective treatment for alcohol withdrawal. I've had issues with alcohol for a number of years where I would drink steadily then stop for a long period of time. I've gone through the 12 step program a few times now, but relapsed. When I ran across this information on Gabapentin I was quite surprised since it's had NO effect, absolutely NONE, in terms of reducing my craving for alcohol even though I'm taking 2,000 mg/per day .

Spent 2 days in the hospital to deal with the shakes and initial horrible alcohol withdrawal. Was prescribed librium and 100 mg Gabapentin x 3 times a day. I'm off the librium and down to gabapentin once per day after 8 days out from being in the hospital. However...I've had little to no withdrawal symptoms. I don't crave alcohol at all and it seems that the combination of librium and gabapentin have staved off the worst. I'm forever grateful at this second shot at life.

I also found that it helped with my shoulder and minor back pain. It also helps as a mood stabilizer for me. In the past things like going to the mall or being in large crowds used to cause anxiety and anger, so I would avoid these and any similar situations.

26,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 11, 2018",99,I am now coming up to 6 months and alcohol free after taking this drug. I am 54 and I was a very heavy drinker. Spirits were my drink of choice and I started early in the morning and easily polish a litre bottle off. I went to see a specialist and she prescribed me Gabapentin/Nuerontin. I took my first pill (300mg) in the evening before going to bed and actually slept all through the night without waking early. No night sweats and grabbing for the bottle to get my first drink of the day. I was a bit fuzzy headed for a few days but that faded however my alcohol cravings had gone. I still have problems with being in groups of people socialising when its booze related so I tend to leave early. I am now the official taxi driver!  I am going back to see my specialist next month so I can cut down slowly on the pills if needed. Currently I am on 300mg x 3 a day.

I had not had a drink ""craving"" since August 11, 2014 when I quit. (I did this within one week of starting gabapentin).  I did have a glass of wine at Christmas, one beer on my birthday, and one glass of wine at Easter.  That's it.   I use to have 10 beers a day, and three glasses of wine or gin for bad panic attacks and generalized anxiety.  So for me (not everyone) I can have that occasional drink with friends, at party or any social event - then come home and not touch the stuff and WITHOUT ANY CRAVINGS AT ALL -  as I had during my 40-year binge.  Still, this drug is amazing. AA never worked for me.",Gaba-Lover
51,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 6, 2016",91,"I went on gabapentin for alcoholism that troubled me for 10 years when nothing including Alcoholics Anonymous barely worked. I read anecdotal information that it helped with alcoholism, went on 600mg twice daily and it was the first thing that helped me. Now I take 1200mg twice daily and find it works great!Afterwards I read a study in the Journal of American Medicine, Gabapentin in Alcohol Dependance, 2014 that confirmed it works well in many people for cravings and binge drinking.This medicine should be further studied to confirm it works well. On this site it is obvious it helps a lot of people struggling with alcoholism which I have, along with Bipolar Disorder. I call Gabapentin my"" happy pills"" that also takes away my anxiety.",Malibu1967

Gabapentin is metabolized through the Kidneys not the Liver. Yay! It's only been 10 days but I'm drink and craving free!! I get a little anxious at night but otherwise a happy camper so far! Good luck!!",L.A.life
56,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 1, 2015",46,excellent for alcohol withdrawals and also for abstaining from alcohol as far as I'm concerned though it does not help me sleep better... maybe I'm just too hyper active,uddergutter
57,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 20, 2015",125,"I was prescribed gabapentin while I was in the hospital after an alcohol related accident. They started me on this while I was in a Xanax induced coma to help with seizures; I had been an alcoholic for 15 years. That was 10/20/13. So many people in the recovery community praise this as a wonder drug, and I agree.  I take 600mg 3 times daily, which is double where I started. The only time I notice the drug is when I'm not on it and my anxiety rises and temper gets short. This drug in combination with a recovery plan is a Godsend.  Haven't had a drink since.",J.M.
58,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,,"May 12, 2015",166,"I have been on Gabapentin for 15 months.  My dose is two 600mg tablets a day for a total of 1200mg in a 24-hour period. I was prescribed Gabapentin for alcoholism first, anxiety second.  This medication is a God send.  After drinking 10-15 alcohol drinks a day for 40 years, within a week I quit and had no side effects from withdrawal - plus the anxiety went away. I do NOT crave alcohol at all.  It is so weird.  I thought it wouldn't work until I tried it - and it does work!  It was THAT quick.  I suggest everyone with an alcohol problem that wants to quit but is deathly afraid to do so, ask your doctor for gabapentin.  It is non-addictive like benzodiazepines (Valium, Xanax).  AA never worked for me.  Gabapentin, IMO replaces AA.",Gaba-Lover
59,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,9.0,,"March 27, 2015",61,"i was drinking heavily for a few months and had to go to detox 6 weeks ago.  i thought i'd be okay to drink about five days ago--started one day with four drinks, escalated to 12 drinks yesterday.  i'm taking neurontin (600 mg 4x/day) right now because i'm scared of withdrawal.  i expected i would be having symptoms today and would have to do an at-home 3-4 day taper.  instead i have had two drinks today, that plus the neurontin and .5 mg of klonopin with barely noticeable symptoms.  i hope to have less than five drinks today, maximum of two tomorrow and then stop for good after.  highly recommend this!",aslasha

61,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,8.0,,"April 24, 2013",120,I have been a sporadic alcoholic for years now. This and my bipolar does not help.  I was prescribed gabapentin 600mg 3 times a day for my frequent and very painful headaches  and I have never felt better. I have no cravings for alcohol and haven't drank for 2 weeks now. I sleep better. I feel positive. I'm happy for the first time In years. More research should be done as it is not a recommended medicine for alcohol withdrawal.,Robbo91
62,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 3, 2013",122,"I have had quite a few severe alcoholic relapses, and Neurontin is wonderful for me for stopping alcohol withdrawal shakes, which seems to tone down the anxiety. It works quickly too for that purpose.",AlcoholicD
63,Gabapentin,Alcohol Withdrawal,8.0,,"October 30, 2011",122,"I have been taking gabapentin for years.  Started after stopped drinking. Had a recent 3 mos alcoholic relapse and continued taking gabapentin during and after. Have been surprised by how easy the alcohol withdrawal has been.  Am also taking Antabuse to avoid a slip but I don't think this is supposed to help reduce the desire to drink.  Anyway, the biggest reason I wanted to post is that I want to caution anyone who tries to get off gabapentin to do so very slowly like maybe reduce by 100 mg or 10% /week whichever is less. I have had horrible anxiety, shivers, sweats, racing thoughts, sleepnessless, pain and more trying to get off it.  ",hybridbn
