1,Valium,Alcohol Withdrawal,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2021",1,I used Valium 10 mg about 6 times to get off alcohol but I know it’s just as bad to get off benzos so I’d stop taking it after a month or so. I relapsed about 8 times and now have the beginning stages of cirrhosis. That’s what it took for me to stop. Valium is good for the withdrawal symptoms but I wouldn’t recommend long term use.,Pamela L

6,Valium,Alcohol Withdrawal,7.0,,"April 20, 2020",34,Valium is great to come off alcohol or any drug however you do not want to take this for more than 10 days. See therapy to sort out the real reasons your masking your hidden troubles to become FREE. Valium is a DANGEROUS ADDICTIVE drug once you have been on it more than 3/4 weeks.  You will only be left with your stuff to be dealt with. Short term .,With it

Was a life-saver for me as before I booked the appointment I considered more alcohol as I couldn’t handle the fear, weird heart rate and constant tremors. At its peak the symptoms and anxiety combined made me feel like I was going to die.",BAH

12,Valium,Alcohol Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 23, 2018",30,"Valium has been a God-send for my benzodiazepine taper. On it a Month now as of March 22,2018. It is very relaxing and mild now but at first it was very sedating for the first 5 days. I take 10mg 2x's a day. I am being tapered off of Klonopin after 12 years on that drug. K-pin is HELL to get off of alone. Glad my psych doc is open minded and dropped the k-pin immediately and switched me to Valium, after I told him about the Ashton Taper Method, and that I wanted off the Klonopin because it was giving me bad withdrawals if I missed a dose. If you are serious about getting off of benzos I URGE you to google the Ashton Taper Method.",StayHopeful

It helps me relax, be less anxious, stopped my trembles, overall it helped a lot. I do feel quite tired though, I hope I will be able to fall asleep. The pills saved my day.

I just try as well not to drink cause I don't want to take more valium than what is recommended for me and its really great. It's also helping drug cravings.
