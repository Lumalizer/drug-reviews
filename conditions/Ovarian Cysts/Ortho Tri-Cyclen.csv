0,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Ovarian Cysts,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 9, 2019",5,"This birth control has been a truly horrible experience for me. The only positive I can say is it cleared my skin after six months, but for the first three months I had eczema on my face, which I’ve never had before. DO NOT TAKE THIS IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN. I was on the lower dose version of this birth control, but was having breakthrough so I switched to this. I still am having breakthrough bleeding. I’ve gained about 10lbs, and my breasts have enlarged so much its painful. I have always had anxiety, but never suffered from mood swings, and this birth control makes me feel like I’m suffering from bipolar. I am constantly angry, both my family and boyfriend have said I have been acting insane. I don’t feel like myself anymore, I feel like I completely lose my sanity the week before I receive my period. Every month I have had breakthrough bleeding and twice I didn’t receive my period at all.",Emma
1,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Ovarian Cysts,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 15, 2019",6,"I've been on Ortho Tri Cyclen for about 20 years.  Works great.  I called Janssen manufacture to confirmed it is no longer being manufactured.  :-(  I have been switched to  Tri Spintec.  This medication is AWFUL.   I have filed a complaint with CVS Caremark stating this is NOT a generic to Ortho Tri Cyclen.   Per Janssen Manufacturing there is NO generic for Ortho Tri Cyclen.  Tri Spintec has induced, extensive bleeding, cramps, headaches, hot flashes, mood swings and the list goes on.  Do Not recommend.  CVS Caremark recommended Leena and Ortho Novum777, they aren't even close to being generics as they have different progestins in them.  There has to be a replacement.  If one is found can someone let me know?  Thank you!",AZ Chic
2,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Ovarian Cysts,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 20, 2018",1,"I have been taking this pill since I was 15.  (5years) I have never had a problem with it.  It had cleared up my acne, the periods are so regular and I always know the exact day of when it starts and ends (they are short and less painful).  My cysts are gone.  I usually have 1 bad painful day but that’s it.  The week before I start, I get EXTREMELY EMOTIONAL.  I cry for no reason, get angry at people, and have weird mood swings.  Other than that, I love this pill. Unfortunately, my dr is changing my prescription to another pill because I have high blood pressure and the chance of stroke is too high (even though I am only 20 years old!!!) I want to switch back tho this pill, it is amazing and effective!",Biggestukfan
3,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Ovarian Cysts,6,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 19, 2018",1,"I started taking ortho tri-cyclen to alleviate severe pain around the time of ovulation and menstruation, for ovarian cysts, and for acne. The first few months were fine, however I’ve been spotting for about a month now. My breasts have gone up a cup size and they’re very tender and swollen, but my acne (which used to cover 80% of my cheeks) is now going away and I only have 3 or 4 spots. I’ve gained some weight, but not too much.",indie
4,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Ovarian Cysts,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 10, 2017",1,"I am about to start my second month on oral contraceptive pill. I have experienced both positive and negative effects, all seem very normal. I have always had a great period - regular, 3-4 days, not too heavy, and hardly any menstrual cramps. My period would only bring awful, very unwanted mood swings. I would always be very emotional and angry. Within the last 2 months, I started to develop ovarian cysts that would rupture and my doctor suggested I take Ortho Tri-Cyclen. Here are my resultsPros: - Mood swings are no longer an issue (my boyfriend has really noticed the difference in my emotional level)- No weight gain - Goodbye cysts! Cons: (these varied throughout the month) - Trouble sleeping w/ weird dreams- Nausea- Menstrual like cramps during placebo week",Viv123456789
5,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Ovarian Cysts,2,,"November 18, 2016",0,"I started taking this pill for ovarian cysts. I also have moderate/severe acne and was told it works well to clear up skin also. On top of that, I get insane cramps during my period. Overall, it was about time I started birth control. I am very unhappy with this pill. After taking the pill for 3 days, my acne got a lot worse, and I broke out on my chin/jawline, which had never happened before. Everyday I get sharp pains (feels like cramps) in my lower abdomen. Today they were so bad that I considered pulling over my car while I was driving and calling my parents to come pick me up. I also have been getting migraines more frequently. Overall, this pill has been a disappointment. If my acne doesnt clear up soon I will switch pills",lucky316
6,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Ovarian Cysts,2,,"September 17, 2016",0,I have been on ortho tri cyclen LO since I was 15 I am now 21 . I recently tried out the regular ortho tri cyclen the past month (I know they say it takes about 3 months to fully kick in) but WORST experience I can't even last more than a month on this . I'm going back on the LO. The amount of water weight I am retaining is INSANE my feet look like sausages . I'm a solid 125 and vigorous gym junkie and I am 132 pounds now and feel like I constantly have a pregnant belly. I go into full mood swings non stop and in general just feel disgusting about myself. my skin is usually clear and I keep getting bad breakouts on my face and shoulders . very nauseous at night as well all the time .,Katiec22
7,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Ovarian Cysts,10,,"April 13, 2016",1,"I started this birth control my freshman year of high school (15-16) due to ovarian cysts. I absolutely adored this medication until about six months ago. Six years on the same pill is pretty impressive! I knew exactly when my period would start and end. Friday at three gone by Sunday at one. About six months ago I started feeling v mood swing, sadness (for no reason), crying out of no where, weight gain and inability to loose weight (which in fairness could be caused by my ovarian disease). All of those symptoms are also what people with Thyroid issues have. I had my thyroid checked and it turns out it was an abnormal hormonal level due to long use of this birth control! Other than that i have had absolutely no problems at all.",britbrat101421
8,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Ovarian Cysts,3,,"December 30, 2015",0,Works bc ever constant migraine all day everyday nausea...loss of appetite..breast so sore I didn't wear a bra for a week. GOOD THING! My period started 2nd day I stopped taking it. No bc ever worked that fast for me,TyAnna
9,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Ovarian Cysts,5,,"April 18, 2011",4,"I took Ortho Tri- Cyclen for symptoms of ovarian cysts.  These symptoms included spotting and/or bleeding when it wasn't time for  my period and periods every 3 weeks (21 days), instead of every 28 or so.  So basically, some sort of bleeding was going on almost constantly!  After a period of about 4-5 months, my symptoms became less severe, the spotting stopped and my periods became less frequent.  However, I experienced severe cramping and longer and heavier periods while I was taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen.  So in some ways it helped the symptoms I had experienced before taking it, but it also created some new symptoms in the year that I took it.",alb34
10,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Ovarian Cysts,4,,"January 3, 2011",7,"I had incredibly painful cramps and was told by both my ob/gyn and general doctor birth control could really help me, so I tried Ortho. My skin stayed just about the same (got some tiny under the skin bumps that didn't bother me) and I was a little tired. My first period on it was extremely heavy and painful, but the next one was lighter and easier to deal with. But I noticed about a month in, I sprouted hair all over my cheeks (which I've NEVER had before). My hormones were basically normal before, but this pill made them go completely haywire (hence the hair growth). But apparently this is a rare side effect. This pill seems to be one of the better ones for other people, but was not right for me. I will keep looking for my perfect birth control.",Anonymous
