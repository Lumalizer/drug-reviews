0,Austedo,Tardive Dyskinesia,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 1, 2020",31,"By all appearances on their website, this drug works by lowering dopamine levels, which is effectively the same as taking higher doses of antipsychotics/neuroletpics.   Yes, you MAY be able to 'hide' tardive dyskinesia (TD) by increasing your antipsychotic (effectively the same thing as lowering your dopamine levels with austedo) but it will eventually come back stronger.   Note well that austedo has some of the same side effects as other neuroleptics, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome and parkinsonism (just like antipsychotics have).   Austedo was approved under ""fast track"" FDA it appears, and I'm guessing didn't get the scrutiny and testing that it probably needed, and boy they're making crazy claims on this drug and charging through the roof (I mean more than a mortgage) for the drug.",Bob
