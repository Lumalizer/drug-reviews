But because I take Xanax they would cut my dose in half until I was able to have not have that in my system so I just never went back up I stayed at the half dose and then went down from there and I am currently on 19mg and today was the first day that I actually felt a physical withdrawal because I did not take my Sunday take home dose. My husband was tragically killed back in October so my counselor suggested that I don't go down at least until spring time but I was going down 5 mg at a time and then I started going down 1 mg until I got to 19 mg.",EMLS

2,Methadone,Opiate Withdrawal,4.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 3, 2021",1,"Yeah it does what it's supposed to do, i.e stops you going into withdrawal -well a full one anyway. The actual withdrawal symptoms of trying to come off methadone, or far, far worse then coming off heroin.  I don't think you ever feel 100% well & that's why many addicts go back to using heroin on top of there methadone, thus creating 2 problems. I was addicted to both for the best part of 16 years.  I'm clean off heroin but still on methadone after more then 17 years.  The side effects off the methadone (far worse then heroin) is the chronic constipation, so bad it's caused me to prolapse, it's worn the enamel off my teeth, the sweating is unbelievable. It is a synthetic drug.  I've worked with drug services, the Doctors at these places say , methadone does not work, but there hands are tied to prescribe something that would, like morphine,as they do in 3 countries.  In these countries crime rates are much lower, morphine has a success rate of around 80+ % where as methadone is as low at 20%",Francis

She said Nik, do you remember what you went through when you was actively using other drugs? I said yes ma'am. She said how much had your life changed since you started the program because I can see you haven't failed a single drug test. I said I have my life back now. She said then don't feel guilty.

Well, as we all know, that wasn’t going to work out with out a plan. Fortunately, we had a friend who was a heroin addict. You would have never known to look at him but I digress.So after about 4 years of injecting heroin, I got on methadone and haven’t touched it or a needle since.I am currently in the process of titrating down from 115 mgs and am at 38 mgs. I’m going down 1 mg a week.

If you have to go onto it do then stop. You are not clean on methadone and the people who supply it to you , use it as a way of controlling you. Your brain chemicals may change after prolonged use but they change back. Get will power rewire your brain, I have used class A drugs every day of my life since I was a teen then methadone for nearly 20 years. I tapered myself off it is easy if you do it slowly and your way. You can do it. Exercise, change your whole life. If you want it you can. If not there is no shame in staying on methadone but you will never be free and it will always be used against you. I've never met a good cpn, Ive never met a nice nurse or doctors.  I think they do not like you if you are on methadone, or I feel they think you are scum. Use this energy to get clean.

9,Methadone,Opiate Withdrawal,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 26, 2021",5,I was addicted to heroin for 6 years. Finally fed up and found a puppy and didn’t want her to live on the streets. So I made the step! Methadone saved my life! I went from being homeless to making $150 with my art! Making more money than I’ve ever seen! Stayed on for 4 years!

Omg it made me super hungry and with sum Antianxiety medication I was able to sleep every day of the withdrawal and eat five meals. The secret to withdrawing is eating and sleeping your body is a machine! But that is easier said than done! Rso oil help speed my withdrawal up!

After telling my clinic doctor that I relapsed despite trying so hard not to while taking the suboxone. I was put on 30mg of methadone and have since increased 50mg = 80mg/day. It got rid of my cravings, anxiety, and helped my depression. This drug has helped me so much in my road to getting off illicit drugs including opiates, benzodiazepines, and prescription amphetamines.

I have loads of sweat coming off me with only a 15 minute walk with my dogs, I feel sleepy after several hours after taking my dose (Also annoyed having to show up to the clinic everyday to take it), and my dose sometimes doesn’t last the entire 24hrs like the doctor said it would.",EazieRecovery

But little did I know basically the only time I was some what happy is when I relapsed and used. Suboxone drains your mind, yes it is an opiate blocker but I swear on every thing it BLOCKS A LOT more than just opiates, it blocked my happiness and my emotions. Relapsed numerous times, Caused me to have horrible depression and anxiety. Last month I was on 24 mg of suboxone (highest I ever been) I was done, so I made the switch to methadone.

The reason for me ending up on it was a lot of bouncing back and forth I have chronic pain in the low back I was hit by a forklift  that ruptured 3 of my discs and tore a hole in my s1 so I started on Percocet moved to oxycodone ( Percocet without acetaminophen ) I slowly started to misuse them since they didn’t work right after a while then I was put on fentanyl patches. When my employer found out I was on fentanyl they said I wasn’t suitable for safety oriented work so  I had to them which made me feel like I was withdrawing and of course like so many others I turned to heroin shooting up 5-10 times a day which got me arrested that’s when I went to treatment. This medication  methadone works. I go down 1mg a week I’m now at 26mg and dropping I think there’s a point where if you use it, work the program and always remember your an addict.

23,Methadone,Opiate Withdrawal,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 6, 2019",37,"This medication helps the cravings, and many other symptoms and may as well be America's answer to the opioid problem, however the program is huge a disaster. You can follow all the rules, have negative urines and do everything you're supposed to and they still don't give you bottles, they don't sign off on your daily dose on time. I lost my job, and a lot of other things trying to follow their program rules. It's impossible to function as a normal citizen when you're being told that you can't even take your daily dose of 2 years because the Dr didn't put the order in correctly. Over and over again this type of thing happens. I've seen a lot of people leave the program in tears every week because not only are the requirements ridiculous but when you do follow the requirements and jump thru all their hoops it's never enough for them.

35,Methadone,Opiate Withdrawal,7.0,,"June 25, 2019",86,Methadone was very effective and I stopped using heroin and taking pills once I got on the program but I found it hard to get off because it became the biggest part of my lifestyle. Everything revolved around picking up my methadone. I felt anxious to travel too far from my clinic. It did get me out of the house though when I otherwise would have had zero motivation. 15 years after being on the methadone program I decided I wanted to be free of all addictions and quit smoking marijuana and cigarettes then tapered off my methadone dose over a 2 year period. It would have been sooner if I didn't fall pregnant. In my experience it was so easy to come off and I believe it was all due to God in my life. He made it easy on me. After 15 years on pretty high doses I expected some withdrawals but besides a bit of restless legs and some nightmares I had no other withdrawal. I now feel like I never even had past addictions.,Jay

I was the only success at that time in a major city in the NW.  Now 30+ years later I am in chronic pain and would like the same medication - a good med for addiction and chronic pain. Yes, withdrawal does last a long time, I’d give it 6 weeks, but for last few weeks it’s mostly fatigue. Chins up peeps, One day you’ll wake up and it will be over!",Suzique
42,Methadone,Opiate Withdrawal,10.0,,"August 5, 2018",38,"For anyone who is refusing to take methadone because of the daily visits and/or cost, just think - it takes a lot less time to visit the clinic every day, than the time spent on contacting your dealer and scheduling a meet up. Going to the clinic is also safer and legal and in addition to that, they provide you with counselling and they teach you how to cope and deal with negative emotions in ways that do not involve opiates .   The counsellors teach you about healthy hobbies because boredom can kill sobriety.  Don't be like the people that are trying to get high off of methadone and don't let the mix of unstable patients that you commonly see at clinics, scare you off from getting help. I know that it can make for an uncomfortable environment sometimes but If you are compliant with the program, you will get take homes and that's less time that you have you spend at the clinic",Green_Sky

If it’s too low you may still have cravings. But also I will say I wasn’t trying to up my dose as high as I could to feel high I just wanted to stay as low as I could but still manage cravings.

Tried rehab several times both in and outpatient but could never go longer than 3 days and that was pretty rare to go even that long.  The inner sense of restlessness and anxiety and other  Post-Acute-Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS)  were just too much to bare and I’d always go back to use.  Methadone finally shut up the part of my brain that constantly was on 24/7 365 begging me to use and the battle got exhausting.  It’s been a journey but after 4 years I finally got my life back and live a normal life because of methadone.  I am so grateful for it I’m afraid to get off!

It takes a long time for the affects of methadone to come out of your body. I would say it will help you but be aware the withdrawals are worse. So if you go this way and be put on it for an addiction it is very hard to come off of.  I get a prescription but am in the same place I started at. Opiates are easier. I've been through both withdrawals and felt like I was going to die. But it is good thing for certain people I just wouldn't do it again.  I learned my lesson that is something needed for addicts for rest your life unless your willing to wait along time to get back to normal.

For this reason it builds in your system and is actually more addicting both physically and mentally than Heroin or any other known opiate. It can take months to get to your desired dose, but it also takes months to get off of, and the biggest challenge is going from 5mg to nothing. It also rots your teeth!",Foxtrotz

92,Methadone,Opiate Withdrawal,5.0,,"February 12, 2016",48,My experience with Methadone is both good and bad. The doctor started me on a low dose at first and gradually increased me 8mg every week until I met my dosing level at 150mg. It did wonders for my life while I was on Methadone. The reason that I rated it at 5 was because when I was ready to start weaning off I didn't know how fast they were going to do it and when I had my last dose I had withdraw symptoms worse then the heroin withdrawal symptoms. My recommendation to anyone who wants to get off any kind of opiates just check your self into an intense rehabilitation that will cater to your needs because withdraw is real and it caused me to have a mild stroke at the age of 31. Really the best advice is to never use/abuse opiates.,3rd Leg Greg

Suboxone is a newer drug that works very well for the suppression of withdrawal symptoms. Suboxone is an agonist and antagonist as well. Not only does it work to suppress withdrawal symptoms of opiate withdrawal, but it also acts as a deterrent from using any opiates because it is a blocker. It is a sublingual pill that is absorbed under the tongue and you should not eat or drink anything for 20 minutes before or after as it will decrease the drugs potency. ",IndigosogidnI

I was at my peak on 120mg daily and now after several months of monitored decreases I am down to 9 mg daily and feel great. On the other side though, there are also a large number of people in the program who, while they can't get the high from morphine, replace it with cocaine.
