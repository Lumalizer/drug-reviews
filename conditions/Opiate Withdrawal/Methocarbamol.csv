0,Methocarbamol,Opiate Withdrawal,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 16, 2022",0,"Back in 07 I was diagnosed with lukemia,, I was pretty bad off.So going through all of that I found out that i have alot of back problems. So for 15 years now I've been taking 30 mgs of oxy 4 times a day and 9 10 mgs of methadone a day. So my doctor got raided by the FBI, no shit. So it's been very hard, I get no sleep, I'm in constant pain and I'm running to the bathroom all the time. I went to the er last night and they gave me one of these pills. It did seem to help, I got a few hours of sleep. And that's one of the worst things for me, it's not being able to sleep. I have to say that this is worst then going through cancer. So at the er they told me to go to a methadone clinic. So I woke today and thought about it, but that would just put me back to the beginning of feeling like shit. So I'm glad I got on here to see all of your stories. So I'm going to go get my script of these and I'm praying to God that it will help. The WD from methadone is bad, I can't take feeling like this.",Justintime

I ended up having total artificial disc replacement and thoracic outlet surgeries on both sides if my neck and upper chest to remove ribs and muscles etc.. about 5 years surgeons . Anyway pain for life was the concensus .I was on 360 MG of Oxy, 300 MG of some 300 MG of Lyrica,  100 MG og trazadone and I think around 3200 MG of motoring?, 300 MG of Cymbalta .  After my last surgery I decide I needed to find out was my  "" Base Pain"" really was now after all the cutting and rearranging. So while my wife was gone for two weeks I started dropping all my meds starting with the Oxy ,lyrican helped.  I got down to 90 MG on oxy then I got rid of the soma and Lyrica oh and 300mg a day of cymbalta!! It was a hardSo m to this month and I titrated down from 80 MG Oxy down to 5 and then quit altogether.  An old bottle of methacarbamaol is how I'm doing it. Stuff was a God send",Determined Dave

4,Methocarbamol,Opiate Withdrawal,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 19, 2021",3,"I believe this generation is in an opiate epidemic. The drugs are fake, so many additives & homemade cocktails. Today is day 2 of withdrawal & it’s extremely painful. Wouldn’t wish it on a worst enemy. Tried Kratom & it helped a little but went away fast & for $25 a pop that’s a little much. Dug around in the medicine cabinet & found bottle of Methocarbamol that I got for my neck a while back & people seem to get relief from it. I took two 750 & Tylenol about 15mins ago & hoping to get some relief so I can catch some sleep. Running off 4 hours of sleep over the past 48+hrs. Mind feeling cloudy, some anxiety, & feels like the flu running they my body. Really hoping these withdrawals ease up over tomorrow & the next day Bcus this is rough. 2nd time detoxing & this is from just 1-2month opiate addiction so I couldn’t imagine coming off after years of abuse. I hope everyone in here looking for help finds sobriety.",Opiate user
5,Methocarbamol,Opiate Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 7, 2021",5,"I took Robaxin 750mg for a few months after back surgery.  I had no idea my surgeon was prescribing it not just for the neck spasms, but also to make tapering off of hydrocodone easier.  Despite my slow taper from 60mg daily to 5mg, I had some intense leg cramps after stopping norcos.  Robaxin helped tremendously.  Combine it with Gabapentin or Pregabalin and you'll get more relief.",anonymous
6,Methocarbamol,Opiate Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 12, 2021",6,Using now to get away from Subutek which to me is the same as opioid addiction. Am basically keeping a 500 mg tablet in my system and so far its a great help after this bottle is gone I am done with any medication that can become habit forming. I am too old for this!,Anonymous
7,Methocarbamol,Opiate Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 5, 2019",105,"I was prescribed tramadol and started taking it for back pain and then months after dosage increased by my doctor. I recently read up on the dangers of long term use and I am a longtime condition patient, since my discs aren't popping back in place themselves and being on medicaid. I am not wanting to be hooked on any opiates, I would rather feel the pain. So. . . . I quit cold Turkey and like others the worst symptoms are the muscles spasms in my biceps, thighs, and calves mainly and tied for worst is NOT BEING ABLE SLEEP SUCKS SO BADLY.  I am yawning and feeling like I should sleep but a part of my brain is like no you're staying awake. But I found a earlier prescribed bottle of methacarbamol after finding it and reading this webpage. Thank you to all other contributors. The methacarbamol kicked in in under 20 minutes it seemed. Muscles spasms gone and gonna try for that long awaited sleep. Goodnight everybody.",Disc pain
8,Methocarbamol,Opiate Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 23, 2018",57,I've hidden my Oxy addiction for about a year and decided I'd had enough. Someone decided to crash into me whilst on my motorcycle and my back has been in bits since. I've gone to the doc for my back and he's prescribed me Robaxin.  I came home to research the drug and BOOM. Its used for Opiate withdrawal. WinnerDoes it help with the depression side of withdrawal????,MrPoopyPants
9,Methocarbamol,Opiate Withdrawal,,,"March 3, 2018",147,I was taking 15mg oxycodone for about two years or a little more than that. My withdrawal (WD) I did alone. No one ever knew I was on them. It was really tough the first week. But robaxin and clonidin helped me with the WD. Doing it alone and having no one to talk to about it was difficult. I never wanted anyone to know. When I got clean I was able to tell a close friend that help me a whole lot. I've been clean for about 4 weeks. And as much as I would love to have the oxycodone I'm being good. I take BC powder when I feel aches   it helps me with the WDI hope this helps at least someone.,Marcus
10,Methocarbamol,Opiate Withdrawal,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2017",114,I've been an opiate abuser for the best part of 20 years I've got clean many times and I've relapsed many times. I'm  now 42 and the withdrawal symptoms seem to get worse with age.  Ok  I'll get to it.  I had a back injury and was prescribed Methocarbamol (my GP) He had no idea I was an addict.  The day I got hold of this medication I was planning to do my detox (AGAIN)  I would normally use lyrica to help with the overall hell of getting clean . So before going to find that medication on the black market I looked up this what I had been prescribed  That night I took 1 750mg and 30mins  later I noticed my rattling pain was greatly reduced!!  Over the next 4 days I took this medication 4 times a day till I'd completed my detox it helped me very much,Floyd rose 75

I'm 32 and for the better the half of my life I've been every kind of pain med. you name it! Seriously. I'm on 4mg DILAUDID 6 times a day plus three 10mg METHADONE! Car accidents, trauma and of course a long line of pain meds year after year getting stronger and stronger. Well this past month I legitimately stuffed up. I was left short on my meds by a about a week. I've been through hell! Come to find out Robaxin helps with the withdrawals!? I have bottles of this shit just never took it. I just came across this website after a week of feeing like death. Robaxin here I come! Thanks all for the advice down there :)",Amandaaaajoyy
12,Methocarbamol,Opiate Withdrawal,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 9, 2017",48,"I have seen this medication work extremely well for all but a few, usually those who struggle with the intense depression which can be brought on by withdrawals. However although immodium is an excellent diarrhea reliever, be careful of how much, how often, and for how long of an extended period of time you use this drug. It is one of the least known (and yes, safest) opioids, but it IS an opioid still, and as such, while it generally does not penetrate the blood brain barrier, does a host of work with the receptors in your gut. At the end of the day, one thing is clear: this drug too, can cause significant withdrawals if used for too long an extended period of time.",Withdrawal warning
13,Methocarbamol,Opiate Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 11, 2016",35,In response to a post regarding how long it takes to get relief. In my researching I found that this medication gradually builds up in your system. When you first start taking it it may take a number of days to experience maximum relief. I find its the ONLY m. relaxant I've tried that relieves my severe spasms & cramping. I thought it wasn't working any more until I went off of it to try several other options. When I resumed taking it the relief was immediate. The neuralgia has muscle symptoms that nothing seems to help- being a chronic pain pt am on several other meds. Am trying Hylands for general muscle discomfort - hoping that will help. Mention that as Hylands is often used during  opiate withdrawl.,Mtgirl1958
14,Methocarbamol,Opiate Withdrawal,10.0,,"May 13, 2016",104,"As a chronic pain patient I use Methocarbamal aka Robaxin to temper my tolerance to my pain medications. I find it very helpful to identify just how much pain medication I need at any one time verses how much my body is wanting because of addiction. It's been extremely helpful post surgery to get off morphine, fentynal and oxycodone.",MrBob
15,Methocarbamol,Opiate Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 14, 2016",151,I am 6 days into detoxing at home after a marathon of using oxycodone Morphine Dilaudid and Fentanyl for around year and Robaxin really helped with the muscle cramps and general creepy crawly feeling you get. Haven't had any episodes of uncontrollable vomiting or diarrhea. I'm also using 8mg Zofran dissolving tabs for nausea and as a prevention for vomiting.  I've been able to eat somewhat the last 2 days. At this point its just to far in to quit. Holding strong but still feeling anxious as can be.,Crazybeautifulbabe

Which is the worst part of opiate withdrawal to me. It also helps with the aches you get that feel like they're in your bones!

19,Methocarbamol,Opiate Withdrawal,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 30, 2015",107,"I am so glad I came across this site. I have Methocarbamol, fortunately, as it was prescribed to me for muscle spasms. Had a C5/C6 surgery last year which alleviated the spasms. But periodically still experience it so I get it refilled every so often. Never knew it could be used for opiate withdrawal. My percs scripts never last through the entire month so I find myself stretching it and towards the end of the month before refill time I start experiencing the skin crawls like most do. I came across this site today and will begin taking the methocarbamol for these WD symptoms. I'll post update to let you all know how it goes. Wish me luck!! And thank you for the input!! I hope it works",DAKINE

I have a mild dependency issue going on, but I've been able to ward off WD symptoms by taking 750 mg of Robaxin, 50 mg of Tramadol, 4 Ibruprofen all at once. Without them I get the runny nose, watery eyes, restlessness, joint pain, etc. The ""cocktail"" I have put together has worked perfectly.

Absolutely no body aches or restless legs! Mentally yes it's tough but this has been way better then I thought it would be. Imodium helps the diarrhea. I am almost 72 hours clean and physically have been great, even played 18 holes of golf yesterday. Slight headache and no motivation but pushing through it.

It really does work! For me the worst part of withdrawal is the pain in the bones (the feeling that your bones want to jump out of your skin). This medication along with Suboxone for me, has almost completely eliminated that pain! I take 2 x 750 or 3 500mg every 6 hours right before I take my Suboxone. Thank you, to whoever has made this pill. NOTE: when I wasn't going through withdrawal the medication had no type of reaction on me. ",Anonymous

I was trying to quit for many many months, but my mind and selfishness just wouldn't allow it.  I lost a lot of important things in my life due to opiate addiction for pain, so I recommend you do what I did and just be honest with the people closest to you, ask doctor for help and be honest with him.  It is very hard to do and will be very emotional, but it will turn your life around I promise.  Go to doctor!",carlsonb20

29,Methocarbamol,Opiate Withdrawal,7.0,,"August 7, 2010",151,"As an opiate addict for about 10 years with a nasty addiction this drug helped aid in the withdrawal/opiate detox. Needless to say it still wasn't easy. This made those long painful nights just a little more tolerable. It helped with the muscle pains where other opiate substitute medications failed me. Also I didn't feel the need to continue taking these once the opiate addiction was driven down to a tolerable rate.As for the the upset stomach, I just tried to keep healthy foods in my diet and that slowly went away.
