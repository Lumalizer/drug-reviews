0,Clonidine,Opiate Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2022",0,"Used clonidine for heavy Kratom use withdrawal, would probably not have made it without this godsend medication. I used two 150mcg the first three days and now one 150mcg up until now, a week later. It has a good back up by science on opiate withdrawal and I was able to sleep properly which I had never had before when I tried to quit. So thats why I was able to make it, I guess! Beware: Measure blood pressure several times a day, mine dropped quite low at times, got diastolic. readings of 60 and lower. Definitely only do this after talking to your doctor and have liquids and salts handy.",Lobster
1,Clonidine,Opiate Withdrawal,10.0,,"February 5, 2022",0,"Just want to share for others suffering to get off the crap out there. I've been taking pills for 4-5 years, oxys, codamol, ms contin 100mg daily, for back injuries. Escalated to hydromorphone dilaudid up to 10 x 8mg a day plus jurnista 32mg a day, even had methadone in small doses for BT. Still lived with pain. Realised how hooked I was when I went without a few of these for a day, intense horrific WDS. So I had enough. I need my life back. I was a shell of my former self. These drugs ruin lives. So I tapered down over a month, hardest month of my life, got down to 1 jurnista a day. Then read all available for home detox, found clonidine info, spoke to my doc, she prescribed me .1mg twice a day (I have low BP usually). I was terrifed. Like scared of not taking the last opioid pill and dying from WD. Instead I took the clonidine, expecting to wake up in full WD, had NIL WD symptoms!!!! On 36 hrs no opioids!! Just a bit headachy and weak. Bearable 100%. Why is this not used more!!!!!",Pasq9

My pain specialist office recently shut down and I couldn’t get norco anymore (legally at least) so I talked to my primary and was prescribed clonidine 0.1 mg 3 times a day and for the first day it didn’t work. Second day I couldn’t take it so I did 0.2 every 4 hours and that’s what helped me 2nd and 3rd day weren’t so bad just sleepy and feeling heavy plus some sedation but overall I’m on my 5th day stopped clonidine this morning hope everything goes well from now on.

Every time I tried to stop I tried to do it on my own, doesn't work. I always had someone to get something from when the doctors wouldn't help. I finally got thru it but hiding everything. Moved to a different state and new it would be a fresh start not knowing anyone. I have heart problems and have had 4 heart surgeries in 3 months so I was always on something. I took everything as prescribed because I didn't wanted go thru withdrawals, wrong. I've been off all prescription meds for 4 days and feeling withdrawal symptoms. Doctor was gonna call in another pain medicine to taper off but I said no so she called in clonidine today so I just took my 1st dose. Hope it works like everyone says.

8,Clonidine,Opiate Withdrawal,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 1, 2021",127,"I’m almost 40, been taking opiates for 20 years exactly this month. I was taking 300mg of Oxycodone a day. I knew it would be hard. I got a script of ninety 0.2mg Clonidine tablets. I know I’m taking too many of them but they really do help the WDs. Without them I couldn’t have done it. I’m on day 2 and it’s relieved about 75% of the worst part of the withdrawals. I cannot recommend it enough! If you don’t want your doctor to know you are addicted to opiates, simply say you want to try Clondine for anxiety. Because it sure helps with that. And I also take  two 0.5mg Xanax XR tablets a day which also helps a lot. Bottom line, it can be done! Use the Clondine for sleep and watch your BP of course. Best wishes to all, the end is only a few weeks away and then it’s just a matter of getting your mood and old self back. Good luck! I hope this helps at least 1 person",Max

Sure, there are some mild side effects, headache, lethargy, etc. But we are talking a week of MILD discomfort vs Methadone and Suboxone that will give you the absolute worst withdrawals of your life for MONTHS.

18,Clonidine,Opiate Withdrawal,1.0,,"June 18, 2019",22,"I’ve been taking prescription Fentanyl, high dose, for 15 years after a bad lupus attack and transverse myelitis that damaged my spinal cord, muscles and nerves. The end result was chronic excruciating pain, and my neurologist prescribed Fentanyl patches. Now  it is considered the evil of all opiates. I am currently on 200mcg, and my doctors want me to taper down.  I tried Clonidine for 2 days, but all it did was make me drowsy and gave me a very dry mouth and dry eyes. It did nothing for my withdrawals and the agonizing myoclonic jerks. Some people say they tried it after 3 days of withdrawals, and it worked wonders. Acute withdrawals often don’t last more than 3 days, so if you made it that far, you were probably over the worst of it anyway, and Clonidine likely had little to do with your recovery. With or without Clonidine, I can’t get through even a few hours of withdrawals yet. I am still hoping to find something to help me get through it.",taper-nightmare

The reason is, clonidine actually intensifies one of the worst opiate withdrawal symptoms: mental depression & weakness. So basically I go from feeling like awful -to- feeling like double awful. And when (we) feel like double awful, then we want to 'use' (opiates) again. This is why clonidine has a very low ""retention rate"", vs. meds like Suboxone and methadone.",Skinny Tree

DO NOT USE OTHER OPIOIDS AS YOU WILL ONLY TRANSFER YOU DEPENDENCY.  AVOID KRATOM, SUBOXONE, METHADONE AS YOU WILL JUST BECOME DEPENDENT ON THEM.  The clonidine needs to be high enough to become slightly sedating.  But at this level it blocks the negative effects of the withdrawal.   To be done right, you need to be monitored by a health professional especially due to BP.   I would recommend checking your BP 4-5 times daily (or have someone else do it) and report to your doctor.  If you think it does not work, your dose is not high enough.  Some require 0.2 mg every 4-6 hours.  Watch BP close.",JerryH48

It takes MOST of the worst withdrawals, but I think if you are too sick, only God will help you. Anyway its SO MUCH better then nothing.
