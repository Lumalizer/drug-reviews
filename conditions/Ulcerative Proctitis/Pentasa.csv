0,Pentasa,Ulcerative Proctitis,2,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 24, 2020",3,"I was diagnosed with UC last year. I was both on Pentasa 8x500mg daily plus daily Salofalk suppositories. I can’t say anything about Pentasa tablets but Salofalk worked very well. Unfortunately Salofalk is not available anymore and I had to switch to Pentasa suppositories which is the worst.I am wondering if any of this drugmakers ever used Pentasa suppositories. I bet they didn’t! It is very hard to use and I prefer bleeding a lot than being mentally depressed by using it (very irritating and very uncomfortable, plus doesn’t dissolve and irritates the area badly) I am missing Salofalk a lot!!",Missing Salofalk
