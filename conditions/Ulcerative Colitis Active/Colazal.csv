1,Colazal,Ulcerative Colitis Active,4,,"April 2, 2008",15,"Tried for a few months some years ago.  No side effects, didn't seem as effective as Asacol for me.  Needs specific conditions in the gut to ""cleave"" into the active medication, I think my particular gut wasn't suited.  Beware that not every med will work in everyone, Asacol included. Try meds and observe how you fare.",Anonymous
