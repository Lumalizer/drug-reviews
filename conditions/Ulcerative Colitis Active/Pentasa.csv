5,Pentasa,Ulcerative Colitis Active,6,,"September 29, 2011",26,"I took Pentasa for ulcerative colitis after Asacol started failing.  Asacol had worked for me for seven years, but when P&G started having manufacturers making it in Europe, it no longer worked.  The Pentasa worked for my ulcerative colitis at 3 grams per day dosage.  The side effects are much worse for Pentasa.  I experienced nausea, mild headaches and severe hair loss.  ",Anonymous
