My GI doc told me and the other docs on my case that I probably had swine flu, and refused to consider Lialda as a possible culprit. The early-onset signs that you're reacting to this drug are that your colitis doesn't improve or gets worse. Having 0 experience (this was a first-line treatment upon my UC diagnosis), I trusted things would improve eventually, as the doctor told me to give it a month. But before that month was up, I was in ICU on full ventilation for 2 weeks & had a cup of bloody fluid drained off of my heart. A pulmonologist noted that my lungs looked like I’d ""inhaled pure lye"" (which I hadn't). Another doctor on my case eventually intervened and gave me a megadose of steroids, which was the only thing that reversed my condition and imminent death. It was a very long, physically painful, and emotionally devastating recovery, something I never should have had to experience.",PC

I used to take 4 pills a day but managed to ween down to 2.  I also realized that part of the healing process came from Spiritual healing and mental attitude.  The stress from a job played a major role in my flare ups.

The only problem, my prescription drug insurance, Medco Health, has removed Lialda from their formulary list. I am really upset about that. I don't know why unless it's because it's so expensive. I guess I'm going to be forced to go back on Asacol.....",Anonymous

52,Lialda,Ulcerative Colitis Active,,,"March 23, 2009",12,"I have been taking Lialda for over three months.  I have lymphatic colitis.  I was taking 3 pills once daily, now I am taking two.  I had horrible side effects when I first started taking the medication - severe cluster headaches, nausea, and numbness in my face. The effects eventually wore off after a week. I still feel like I am not right though but my doctor has encouraged me to continue to take the drug for at least a year.  I also have panic disorder which got worse than ever after I started taking Lialda. I finally got back on Effexor. I have lost weight. The colitis started getting better with the Effexor.",5jlw42

54,Lialda,Ulcerative Colitis Active,2.0,,"February 27, 2009",16,"I have take Lialda for 3 weeks and not much improvement. My doctor increased my intake to 3 pills everyday and started me on prednisone. In my opinion prednisone will do most of the work. I do not plan on taking Lialda long term because of side effects of headache, cramping, bloating, etc. This pill does not work fast enough.",Anonymous

56,Lialda,Ulcerative Colitis Active,9.0,,"November 30, 2008",37,"After one year of fairly significant ulcerative colitis symptoms, I began taking Lialda. It began working almost immediately. Within a week I started feeling like my old self again. The only changes I've noticed (unsure if they are side effects or new problems??) are tingling in my legs (like restless leg syndrome), sinus issues, sore throat and trouble falling asleep.

I've suffered relentlessly for 20 years and finally found a great doctor, who gave me this medication. It's not an overnight fix. I've been taking it for 3 months and it has fixed what I thought was permanently my lot in life. What a fantastic medication !",Anonymous

59,Lialda,Ulcerative Colitis Active,9.0,,"March 29, 2008",41,"I've taken Lialda for about a month for my UC using doctor samples. It has reduced my flare ups, although it does take a while and does not work over night, it seems to be working for me. I want to continue taking Lialda and have a perscription from my doctor but can't seem to find a pharmacy that carries it. My overall rating of Lialda is high because it was working, atleast for me. I would suggest finding out if you can get LIalda in your area before consideration.",Packer Fan
