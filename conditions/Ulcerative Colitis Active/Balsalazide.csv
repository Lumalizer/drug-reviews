2,Balsalazide,Ulcerative Colitis Active,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 4, 2021",0,"Been taking 9 pills for a year. Zero percent effective on me. My UC has become much worse. Prednisone was added, budesonide, canasa, & Uceris with Humira for the past 6 months. I have no control of my bowels. My UC is out of control & I have black stool & black pools in the toilet. My GI has no explanation as to why I have upper intestinal bleeding. I had an endoscopy and a colonoscopy just recently. Polyps were removed and my colon refilled the progression of my ulcerative colitis. But my doctor still has no definitive reason as to why I have black stool.",JenniB

4,Balsalazide,Ulcerative Colitis Active,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 7, 2019",0,I’ve just started on balsalazide three 750mg capsules three times a day.    I was having a Crohns flare up every  six months prior to this drug! I’m hoping and praying this med will keep me out of the hospital!

8,Balsalazide,Ulcerative Colitis Active,4,,"April 2, 2008",15,"Colazal (balsalazide):Tried for a few months some years ago.  No side effects, didn't seem as effective as Asacol for me.  Needs specific conditions in the gut to ""cleave"" into the active medication, I think my particular gut wasn't suited.  Beware that not every med will work in everyone, Asacol included. Try meds and observe how you fare.",Anonymous
