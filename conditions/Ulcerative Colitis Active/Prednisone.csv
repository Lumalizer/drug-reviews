While this drug works wonders at high doses to kick your colon back into working order, the side effects are what make it the worst. If you’re on too high of a dose for too long, you’ll develop moon face. Good luck getting rid of that because it takes months. If you’re on too low of a dose you’re miserable and will be begging your doctor to put you on a higher dose. You’ll almost always have sleeping issues: not being able to fall asleep, staying asleep, waking up in the middle of the night constantly, etc, so be prepared with melatonin or some type of natural sleep aid. If you’re on a high enough dose you’ll also be able to eat double your normal amount of calories, so learn to practice portion control and self control because you’ll also have cravings for anything and everything at any time of day. Also begin taking calcium and vitamin D supplements. If you are on this drug long enough, more than 3 months, you will lose bone mass",UC sufferer
