My GI doc told me and the other docs on my case that I probably had swine flu, and refused to consider Lialda as a possible culprit. The early-onset signs that you're reacting to this drug are that your colitis doesn't improve or gets worse. Having 0 experience (this was a first-line treatment upon my UC diagnosis), I trusted things would improve eventually, as the doctor told me to give it a month. But before that month was up, I was in ICU on full ventilation for 2 weeks & had a cup of bloody fluid drained off of my heart. A pulmonologist noted that my lungs looked like I’d ""inhaled pure lye"" (which I hadn't). Another doctor on my case eventually intervened and gave me a megadose of steroids, which was the only thing that reversed my condition and imminent death.

I was put on Mesalamine and it immediately worked great. Within days the symptoms had receded but in place of those I am one of the few to get the dreaded headaches. I have never had a headache in my life until then. I tried to hang in there until finally having to throw in the towel. It was so bad I couldn’t sleep. At all. I went days without sleeping. I took the max amount of aspirin I could but didn’t matter. Once I started actually hallucinating my wife said No more. I stopped taking it. The headaches stopped immediately and fortunately the flare was also ending at that point.

I've been taking it for 3 months and it has fixed what I thought was permanently my lot in life. What a fantastic medication !",Anonymous
103,Mesalamine,Ulcerative Colitis Active,9.0,,"October 3, 2008",17,"Asacol (mesalamine):It has been very helpful in controlling my UC.  I have been taking it since my last episode along with prednisone and it has been a life saver.  I have had no really side effects except extra secretion of saliva, but I am starting to feel much better since starting these medicines.",Anonymous

So far so good.",Wife of UC sufferer
105,Mesalamine,Ulcerative Colitis Active,7.0,,"April 2, 2008",38,"Canasa (mesalamine):This is a 5-ASA suppository.  Helpful in gaining control of a mild UC flare.  No side effects.  Fairly easy to ""hold in"" compared to Rowasa, but doesn't spread as far, pretty much only the rectum.  A little lube helps, I also knock off the rough edges on the blunt end.",Anonymous
106,Mesalamine,Ulcerative Colitis Active,6.0,,"April 2, 2008",24,"Rowasa (mesalamine):Effective in gaining control of a moderate UC flare, but awful to use.  This is an enema that should be retained - ""Held in"" all night.  This is especially difficult for me during a flare.  Don't fart! Stains. Tip- squeeze all the air out before administering.",Anonymous
107,Mesalamine,Ulcerative Colitis Active,8.0,,"April 2, 2008",37,"Asacol (mesalamine):I've been on Asacol for years - 12 tabs /day.  No side effects, easy to take, but sometimes during flares it fails to release.  Release is pH dependent (as are some competing drugs), in my case I think that's the problem. This problem is not well publicized, so doctors aren't aware of it.",Anonymous
108,Mesalamine,Ulcerative Colitis Active,9.0,,"March 29, 2008",41,"Lialda (mesalamine):I've taken Lialda for about a month for my UC using doctor samples. It has reduced my flare ups, although it does take a while and does not work over night, it seems to be working for me. I want to continue taking Lialda and have a perscription from my doctor but can't seem to find a pharmacy that carries it. My overall rating of Lialda is high because it was working, atleast for me. I would suggest finding out if you can get LIalda in your area before consideration.",Packer Fan
