0,Enoxaparin,Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis after Hip Replacement Surgery,10,,"September 14, 2015",2,"I just started taking this drug as a trial  for avascular necrosis to try and reestablished blood flow to my left hip. I have been tested and found genetically prone to have vascular disease and blood clots so I was approved to use this. After 3 days, I have a very sore tummy, 1 black bruise and a headache but a lot of hope that as the 2nd person to try this drug, in this area, to save a hip joint from replacement, that all will be well. All your words gave me hope. Thank you.",Tracy  Mc.
