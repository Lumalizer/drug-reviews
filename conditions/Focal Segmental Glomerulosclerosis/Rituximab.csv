0,Rituximab,Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 24, 2019",5,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) recurred in my transplant about a month after receiving it. My nephrologist said that this helped some patients go into remission. Not me of course. I did 4 rounds of this drug on separate occasions. One side effect I had was pretty annoying, my throat felt like it was slightly swollen. They assured me this was common! I thought I was having an allergic reaction. A nurse said it was attacking something thats common in the esophagus and thats why. Its scary. It was a long infusion. After my 4th treatment, the Ritux was concentrated in my blood. I had no relief from the FSGS. The best relief I found was from plasmapheresis. I had severe skin sensitivity. I couldn't wash myself or lie down without hurting. My skin hurt to the touch like a sensitive bruise. This lasted about 3 days. I also got a slight fever.",Steph
1,Rituximab,Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis,10,,"January 26, 2013",14,"I was diagnosed with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. After a number of years my kidneys failed I was transplanted with my brothers kidney, we were a perfect match. 8 days later a biopsy showed the FSGs present in the new kidney. Within a year all my pre-operation symptoms were back. As a last ditch effort we tried Rituximab and after 5 infusions I began to go into remission I have been symptom free for nearly 3 years. I would highly recommend anyone in a similar situation to try this medicine. I truly feel better than ever, and had zero side effects. The manufacturer has a program where they give it free to folks with Subpar insurance like me. although I did have to come up with a few thousand for the infusions it was well worth it. Good luck.",ms. milo
