0,Nortriptyline,Tinnitus,1,,"May 15, 2020",14,"I was taking Amitriptyline for a month and wondered if Nortriptyline would have less symptoms. Since Amitriptyline makes me constantly tired and reduces my sense of taste. So I talked to my doctor and was given 25mg capsules to take once a day.At first I felt a bit disoriented, almost as if it was the opposite of something like Adderall. But I wasn't tired all day and my taste buds returned to me in full so whatever, it seemed better the first few days.After nearly a week in, my tinnitus' screeching was becoming intolerably loud and made it harder and harder to fall asleep. Some days It would take more than an hour or maybe two simply to fall asleep. Within a few days it was becoming obvious not only made it worse. Also while my sense of taste wasn't changed, there was something about the taste of almost anything that wasn't satisfying. After two weeks, I went back on Ami.Amitriptyline might only help a bit but at least it does something to make tinnitus marginally more sufferable.",ComradeWinston
