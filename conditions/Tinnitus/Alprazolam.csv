1,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 10, 2021",1,"I developed tinnitus from tennis accident where serve (doubles) hit behind my right ear.  The tinnitus started instantly.Doctor prescribed me some Valium, which did not affect it.  I happen to have an ongoing, low dose (0.25 mg) Rx for Alprazalam, and I did notice that Xanax helps the most, but short half life.I've also discovered that melatonin helps reduce tinnitus at bedtime, but can't take more than 0.5 mcg melatonin, because of hangover effect.",Dale Howard

3,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 1, 2020",40,"I've been suffering from tinnitus for the last month after taking Aspirin and Advil for inflammation-related pain. It's been making me crazy. Last night I took a 0.5 mg Alprazolam and 100 mg Magnesium Glycinate, Doctor's Best brand. Both reportedly treat tinnitus. I woke up 12 hours later,  and the ringing in my ears is 100% gone. So relieved!!I take Alprazolam for panic attacks, too, but my tolerance has built up and it's no longer helping me. I'm afraid to up my dose, for fear of overdosing. (I'm  on several other meds for chronic pain.) Magnesium has been helping me sleep and with mood, in place of my Alprazolam.",Elaine
4,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 4, 2020",67,"I have ringing in my right ear which has come out of no where. Hearing test was perfect, MRI showed nothing. Doctor put me on low dose of xanax and after a couple days the ringing went to a low fizzing sound that I can tolerate. The original ringing was so bad I was having some dark thoughts . Thank God its helping I'm very anxious by nature so perhaps the anxiety brought it on.",Lynn
5,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 8, 2020",49,"I was prescribed 0.5 mg alprazolam by my primary care doctor to help with anxiety on flights.  I found it to be good for stress and anxiety and helped me sleep, but I avoid using it regularly due to the potential for dependence.Several years later I was hit with a terrible spike of tinnitus, constant, loud, and with severe impact on my quality of life.  Alprazolam is in fact the only treatment I have found that improves my tinnitus symptoms.  Taken at night, I receive nearly 24 hours of relief.  I intend to discuss with my doctors why this relief is experienced -- I do not believe it to be placebo and I do not believe it is evidence that the tinnitus is merely a stress/anxiety-induced condition.I'm hopeful this is evidence that a similar medication with less dependency concerns may have a similar affect.",JR
6,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 6, 2020",26,"I have been taking  1/2 of a 0.5mg alprazolam for 6 months 1 hour before bedtime for severe tinnitus as the only way I can get a full night of sleep.  I have had no side effects and take many other drugs as I am 72 years old.  Unfortunately, my primary physician doesn't want to renew my prescription so I am seeking a new doctor she was good but her hospital is making her practice like a ""doc in a box"" for cuts, bruises, broken bones, colds, etc.  What a shame she is a good doctor who discovered nodules in my thyroid that were cancerous now she is more like a nurse.",gmcajun
7,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 5, 2019",16,"While playing tennis I was hit with first serve, behind my ear as I was playing the net (doubles).  This was in 2014 or 2015.  The tinnitus has never stopped, and I had hearing loss in that ear.My doctor tried Valium right away.  That had virtually no effect.  Lorazepam (Ativan) has a slight effect.Alcohol will deaden it, but not good for rest of body (esp. liver).I have tried CBD oil (non-THC) and that helps slightly.I have found that Melatonin, maybe 0.5 mg - 1 mg at night tones down the tinnitus.  I use ""Sleep Sounds"" app on my iPad or iPhone to make white noise for sleep too!",Dale in ATL
8,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 21, 2019",36,I was on prescribed Xanex & Lorazepam for 11 years.  A doctor cut me off cold turkey  August 2018.  I almost died.  I developed tinnitus about October 2018.  It's driving me crazy.  Literally.,candygirl
9,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,10.0,,"November 16, 2018",35,45 yo male.  I had shoulder infection following ortho repair of destroyed scapula/shoulder that required 12 months of IV antibiotics ending in 2016.  Ciprofloxacin was the main one and the one that finally got the NTM under control.  6 months after we stopped then meds I wake up with headache and tinnitus in the middle of the night.  I remember it being worse at first just because the onset was sudden.  MRI the whole works.  The hairs in the upper band are dead in the right ear only.  The nerve is generating signal like when someone loses a limb and get phantom itches.  I got to a point where I can generally coexist with it during the day. When it's low I have found it's a 9500 Mhz sine wave.  When it's loud it's like a tree full of Kansas City Cicadas in the summertime.  I dislike drugs but I find that being able to push it away with meds is better than not sleeping.,middle_aged_dude

11,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,9.0,,"October 3, 2017",33,"I have had tinnitus for more than 1 year , nothing helped me, until I started eating Alprazolam with my other medicines, it was really helpful, I eat one Omega 3 , one  Ginko gel in the morning and vitamin B1 and the mix of zinc, magnesium, calcium after lunch and at night one Alprazolam ( 0.5 )  and Betahistin , this medicine diet was great for me , also stop smoking and drinking alcohol is very very very important , please test it .",Masoud Khorsand
12,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,2.0,,"August 13, 2017",42,"I have moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss. Xanax alleviated my tinnitus a great deal for a couple years. After that, I reached tolerance to Xanax and it was no longer effective. What's more, unless I increased the dose, the tinnitus was louder than ever. Because of tolerance, I was having withdrawal symptoms between doses. Since tapering off and discontinuing Xanax, I have been out of my mind with anxiety and loud hissing tinnitus. These will subside as my brain recovers from the damage the drug has caused. Please educate yourselves about benzodiazepines. Don't rely on your doctor because most of them are recklessly uneducated about the dangers of benzos.  0.5 mg. of Xanax is not a low dose; it is roughly equal to 10mg of Valium.",Simonbarsinister
13,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 13, 2017",38,"I have severe tinnitus after having IV antibiotics administered for a systemic infection. This was in 2014. The hair cells in my ears were damaged by the antibiotics. It was impossible to sleep. Tinnitus is constant and loud. I take 3 mg before bedtime so I can fall asleep. The tinnitus wakes me up in the morning. I use hearing aids designed for tinnitus and they help. Unfortunately, the xanax is causing memory loss and changes in my cognition. I want to get off of it. I live alone and am 61 years old. I need to have my brain completely functional to enter old age independently. I'm considering medical detox but have no idea how I will go on with the intense sound in my head. Anyone else detox and find an alternative?",Hurlgirl
14,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 14, 2017",39,"After 8 ear surgeries, the tinnitus had grown louder then I could bear. It became overwhelming to be in groups of people larger than 4, hard to concentrate (at work or at play) because of the weird, loud constant sounds and forget about going to sleep if you focus in on the noise, your mind will not let go of it!!Alprazolam has not made it go away but, has put it where it belongs, in the far off background. Which has allowed me to live a pretty normal life once again. Thankful !",Stapendectomy
15,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 3, 2017",85,I developed tinnitus and it has been driving me nuts for a year. I reduced my dosage of alprazolam this past week to the point that I have not had any of this medication for several days now. Guess what! No tinnitus. It is completely gone. My alprazolam prescription is 2mg. If I find myself needing a dose because of anxiety I will take one half of a pill and it should get rid of my anxiety. I wanted other people to know the use of alprazolam can cause tinnitus.,bonesmichael
16,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 6, 2017",52,I've been experiencing tinnitus since a severe ear infection and infection of my mastoid cell located behind my ear on my skull which resulted in extreme fullness and hearing loss. After getting my ear suctioned because antibiotics weren't helping and a tube put in I got my hearing back in my left ear but was left with bothersome tinnitus. To the point it was driving me crazy!!! That's been 7 years now. My family Dr recently prescribed xanex for my anxiety and panic attacks. I take .5 twice a day and I couldn't believe it all but eliminated 90% of the high pitch in my ear! I still can't believe it and plan bringing it up at my next appointment. I started researching and so happy I'm not alone with this experience. I can wait to tell my Dr!,DDLT
17,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 11, 2016",63,"Severe Tinnitus both ears, rings 24/7 and only Xanax seems to help, it does not eliminate the tinnitus but for some reason it calms it down so it's not as loud and makes it bearable it is the only drug that has helped me. My Tinnitus is so loud it  causes headaches, ear pain and insomnia due to the severity of the tone I hear.",Bethoccom
18,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,1.0,,"April 2, 2016",26,"I've has ear ringing on and off for 30 years...well never off, but sometimes more severe than others. Last weekend I copped 4 .5 mg xanax's from my gal, took em Sunday night. Today is Friday...yesterday, Wed and Tuesday the ringing was the worst it's ever been and I'm sure it's from xanax..not withdrawal really, just from xanax. I used to take valium and maybe that's how I got ear ringing in the first place. It's almost gone today...ill never take another xanax.",Den33
19,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,9.0,,"January 27, 2016",67,"I've had a ringing/buzzing in my right ear (only) for several years. It's been stressful I could barely function. My doctor prescribed alprazolam so I could relax & sleep at night but 1 day, when the ringing was unusually loud/distracting, I decided to just try using it during the daytime. I took 1/2 of a tablet and within a very short time, less than 1/2 hour, the ringing was gone. It seems to be effective for about 6-8 hours. I also take my usual 1 tablet for sleeping and my anxiousness about tinnitus is under control for the most part. I don't understand but I'm too happy to question it. My prescription is for 1 tablet 2X/day so I'm on the low end when taking only 1 1/2! ",Keith's Mom
20,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,,,"January 26, 2016",31,"I don't know if I should take xanax ! But I have been considering on doing it, I am usually afraid of drugs , but this hissing in my ear its so annoying to the point that it is debilitating I can barely make it through the day so any suggestions I will appreciate",Percha
21,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,10.0,,"January 23, 2016",44,"I have been suffering from tinnitus for years.  It was pretty bearable when I first experienced it; however, I fell on the ice a few years ago and hit the back of my head and neck.  I developed vertigo, which has gotten much better but the tinnitus was still unbearable.  I tried Xanax to calm my anxiety and found it to greatly help my tinnitus.  I was afraid of getting addicted to it but I only take a small dose and don't take it everyday.  When I don't take it, the tinnitus is pretty bad.  I don't know if it is because the anxiety is so bad and it helps that but it certainly reduces the volume of the tinnitus.",Angela O
22,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,9.0,,"December 12, 2015",37,"I took clonazepam instead of xanax, but they are in the same family. I found it greatly helped my tinnitus. I was ready to lose my mind when I first got tinnitus from a virus in my inner ear 12 years ago. I swear clonazepam saved my life, as I was struggling with the idea of living with tinnitus forever. Anyone considering it should be aware that benzos are addictive and can have long-term negative side effects - I didn't realize it at the time. I'm now tapering off clonazepam, as I hope to be able to handle the tinnitus with meditation, Effexor (anti-depressant and anti-anxiety drug) and a stubborn will. I do not regret using clonazepam for 12 years, but be aware going off it can be difficult. Most doctors aren't aware it helps tinnitus!",Robyn25

I had a prescription for Xanax that I only used for anxiety very rarely.  30 pills lasted at least 6 months, but I read that Xanax may help tinnitus and started taking a half of .5mg pill each night before bed and it saved my life.My ENT doctor won't give me Xanax for some reason she told me to go back to my PCP, she suggested Melatonin which gave me startling nightmares and my PCP wants me to come in each time he renews the prescription.  I don't care for my PCP but I'll go back to him and I'm sure he'll lecture me on the Xanax.",Sadie4913

I really don't know what caused my ears to ring but that's the only prescribed drug I'm taking right now I only take it at night because it helps me sleep but sometimes I take another pill in the morning .

25,Alprazolam,Tinnitus,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 10, 2015",75,Xanax absolutely saved me from going crazy from tinnitus.  Lowered my anxiety due to hissing loudly at night.  I also use low sodium and drink plenty of water. The white noise app helps a lot.  I wear ear buds on low for 15 minutes and it usually lowers the sound in my head.  I especially like the shower sound.  I never need xanax during the day.  I use .5mg or 1mg XR(generic) at night.  Bless all of you who have the crazy T.,Andipandi

I had gotten to the point of completely ""losing"" it.  The constant ringing, buzzing, etc. was driving me insane and causing anxiety.  My doctor prescribed Xanax for the anxiety, but it clearly brought the tinnitus under control.  I no longer suffer from anxiety because I'm no longer stressed by the continuous noise.  Xanax gets a bad rap, but it saved me and made my life normal again.  Many thanks to my doctor.",sadie66

I tried masking devices, supplements, etc and nothing worked. My doctor prescribed Xanax to relax me enough to get some rest at night. After 2 nights, the hissing subsided during the day. Now some days I have little or no head noise. I  continue to take Xanax with no side effects except being a little tired in the afternoon.

I understand the risks but the risks of disabling tinnitus were 1 million times worse. This medicine needs to be studied further as I also agree that severe tinnitus related to sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a brain condition. I tried a million things beforehand (steroids, steroids injected into ear, hyperbaric oxygen, etc.) Xanax saved my life.",Myinput

So I keep reading on other testimonials and read alot  of people took zanax and it seemed to quite the ringing down.

My tinnitus is so loud it cannot be tested, and after a lifetime of living with tinnitus, I sought help.
