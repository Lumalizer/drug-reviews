0,Apixaban,Venous Thromboembolism,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 16, 2021",12,Eliquis (apixaban):I took myself off Eliquis after taking it for several months for an internal jugular vein thrombosis due to its unbearable side effects and replaced it with baby aspirin. The side effects stopped and I've been off it for about a month. I don't advise anyone else to do this but it worked for me so far.,Mag
1,Apixaban,Venous Thromboembolism,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 16, 2020",2,"Hi I have been taking Eliquis for 2.5 months for treatment of a large thrombophlebitis that almost went into deep vein. Vein almost back to normal now. I was fine up until 2 weeks ago when I found blood in my urine, also had a discomfort in groin almost like period cramps. Been for bladder ultrasound and bloodwork ,both normal . Blood getting heavier and possibly coming from uterus, more tests which I canâ€™t afford! Stopped taking drug and will see what happens next, hopefully bleeding will stop. Beware.",Jules

3,Apixaban,Venous Thromboembolism,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 23, 2018",50,"Eliquis (apixaban):I've been using Eliquis for a month now and it is horrible .I have tremors, headache, a lot gas, body pain and joint pain.  I take it for prevention of DVT.  If Dr don't find other way to treat me I'll just have to change Dr because Eliquis side effects are bad and they won't change it to  something else. I think the Dr gets paid extra for prescribing this medicine because he is to obsessed with give me this garbage.",Toro
