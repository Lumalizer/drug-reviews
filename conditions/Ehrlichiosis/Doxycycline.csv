0,Doxycycline,Ehrlichiosis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 7, 2021",1,"Taking doxy for anaplasmosis (closely related to ehrlichiosis, but not on the list).  Was in bed with 102-103 fever for three days barely able to walk or eat.  Felt 70% better after the first dose of doxy.  With the second dose, fever was completely gone.  It was the first time I was sick enough to really appreciate the magic of antibiotics -- to go from being barely alive to almost back to normal within a matter of hours.  I am still recovering and feel a little off, so I can't tell whether it's the remnants of anaplasmosis or side-effects of antibiotics, but even if these are the side-effect, it's a very small price to pay.",jl
1,Doxycycline,Ehrlichiosis,10,,"August 25, 2016",3,Day 2 and feeling ok....I have to take with food or else I'm very sick to my stomach. It's giving me bad headaches but better then how sick I was 24 hours ago.,Lmg1283
2,Doxycycline,Ehrlichiosis,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 24, 2016",3,"I'm just on day 2 of a 10 day script and seems to work. The fever i fought for 5 days is gone. However, it feels like needles poking me all over my body. Also i wish i had known before not to lay down for at least 30 minutes after taking. I had THE WORST reflux pain I'd had in 3 years last night. Also some chest discomfort. All after 2 doses. Happy it's working on the infection causing the fever but alot of discomfort. Jury is still out, hopefully the side effects are short lived.",Mike573
