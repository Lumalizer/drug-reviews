0,Trazodone,Headache,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2022",0,"Was prescribed 100mg for insomnia I have experienced migraines all my life, had ovarian cysts rupture, broken a few bones, had appendicitis. I have never experienced pain as terrible as the trazodone headache. It woke me up and wouldn’t leave for 2 days nothing helps you can’t sleep it off. There is no relief. I would never recommend this medication on the off chance you experience this headache as well.",Notafan

6,Trazodone,Headache,,,"April 3, 2021",16,"Apparently people who have migraines on a regular ... Trazodone helps. But for me, it was prescribed to me yesterday for insomnia. I took it for the first time last night and woke up with a head ache, which lead into a migraine for the entire day. You would laugh if you came across what I look like right now. I have a hot rice pack, full of lavender essential oil, hanging over my head. It's only getting worse. Idk if I will take another one tonight. I tried coffee. Pressure points. Twilight ...",Diana
7,Trazodone,Headache,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 22, 2020",30,"I don’t recommend trazadone at ALL nfor headches. It did make me sleepy, but it also made me feel a bit dizzy and nauseous. which gave me major anxiety. The next day I woke up with a pounding headache and I couldn’t move my head. It was terrible. It lasted 2 days. I wasn’t sure if it was the medication at first or not, so I waited about a week to try it again and the same thing happened. I’m aware everyone is different when it comes to the tolerance of medication, but I hope this was helpful.",Anonymous
8,Trazodone,Headache,1.0,,"January 8, 2020",25,"My provider has been prescribing me this medication trazodone for last 2 years for a sleep aid. At first I did not realize how & where I was getting all the throbbing migraine headaches & the major sexual side affects until I did research. To walk around popping excedrin all day & NEVER able to get an ERECTION was awful. Not worth a dime to me, finally discontinued. I stayed awake all day & exercised & was able to sleep 8 hrs fine now. Just be active all day.",ken

10,Trazodone,Headache,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 31, 2019",17,"After decades of insomnia I thought I had found the help I needed. I slept for 7-9 hours every night. It was great for the first month then the headaches started every few days and they would last for 2-3 days. I also have a history of migraines, but researched and discovered I could not take sumatriptan with Trazodone. Taking NSAIDs are not good either. So I’m going to discontinue.",Panda

12,Trazodone,Headache,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 5, 2019",45,I had a horrible headache the entire next day. Also felt tired and out of it. I’d rather deal with being tired from no sleep than the way this drug made me feel the next day.,Jeff P.
13,Trazodone,Headache,1.0,,"May 2, 2018",15,"I took this medication for a few years for my migraines, I suffered from tremors, stomach issues, constipation, blurred vision and skin issues. Basically almost all of the side effects listed I suffered from. It was not till I missed two days did I know about the withdrawals which were very bad. I slowly weaned off this medication and for over six weeks dealt with withdrawals. After I stopped my headaches changed and are not as bad. I didn’t know my meds were making me sicker. While on it I was 50 lbs under weight and diagnosed with anorexia, for me the best was getting off this. My opinion is this is very bad for me.  If you take this be sure not to ignore your feelings and issues you didn’t see prior to taking this.Just be careful...",Meb54b

19,Trazodone,Headache,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 7, 2012",140,"Trazodone has been a miracle for me. It has helped my headaches, which I was having daily. It also has caused me to lose some weight, which makes me feel better. It has also helped with my anxiety. Only problem I have had so far, is that if I take it too late at night, I will feel groggy in the morning. I am on 100mgs.",Anonymous
