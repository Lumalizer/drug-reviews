0,Advil,Headache,8,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 3, 2022",0,"Have been working every time for migraines unless migraine is with vertigo.   Triptans have not worked. Severely caused acid reflux but migraine pain is unbearable, so Prilosec is big help",Anonymous
1,Advil,Headache,10,,"January 12, 2020",7,"I get frequent headaches. By frequent, I mean I’ll get at least one every day. I’ve tried a lot of pain relief methods, but not one method or medicine has worked the way Advil has. Advil is a godsend. I’ve been using it when needed for years now. It’s truly the work of the heavens. It clears up my headache in a half hour maximum. For me, I get no side effects that others talk about (nausea, queasiness, diarrhea, etc.) and it works perfectly. I truly couldn’t imagine a more perfect medicine for pain and fever relief in my life. I recommend this medicine and nothing else for pain.",Alexa
2,Advil,Headache,4,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 21, 2017",12,"I used to take Advil for headaches years ago. I must have taken a lot of it, because I had many headaches.  It worked great at the time. Now I have micro colitis which can be caused from taking to much of this NSAIDS. I really wish Google was around back in the day when I was popping all those Advil! I wouldn't be in the situation I'm in now with my stomach problems!",Darchick
3,Advil,Headache,10,,"December 26, 2016",10,Always take this pain pills is the ONLY ONE works for me and I visited to many doctors office and change medication but always back to advil because is more safe to take this compare to the doctor prescription.,JB 2019
4,Advil,Headache,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 16, 2016",7,"Advil is my pain reliever of choice, and I take it occasionally to relieve severe headaches; however, it is not without its (many) faults. For starters, it often takes as long as 2 hours to start acting. Also, it is VERY hard on my stomach—taking even the smallest recommended dose makes me feel queasy and nauseous. I actually prefer the children's Advil, as it has a similar pain-relieving effect without as much stomach pain.Overall, Advil is a worthwhile pain medication, but I would recommend using it sparingly.",pseudonymous
5,Advil,Headache,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 22, 2016",12,"I have used Advil (Ibuprofen) for over a year for most headaches. It works like a charm, better than any other medicine I've tried, even ones previous doctors have recommended (my current one does recommend Advil). When I was a kid, I used the children's Advil (chewable), and it still worked great. It didn't taste like grease, unlike most other children's medicine I had. Now as an adult, I still love it. I've never experienced any side effects, nor have I ever had any negative reactions to it. It starts kicking in super quickly, and the headaches don't tend to come back after I take a tablet of Advil. Overall highly recommended, not too pricey (especially for the amount of drug in each capsule and for the number of capsules in a container).",S_KittenLover7172006
