Naproxen 500mg twice a day (sometimes I even do three times a day) is seriously the only thing that saves me! If the pain is that bad, I will take a Tylenol with it, but normally it does the trick on its own.",kd5192

7,Naproxen,Headache,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 21, 2019",4,"Naproxen works well for my migraines. I always eat something or take it with milk to protect my stomach. If my migraine has progressed to me vomiting, I need to take maxalon and then wait for 30 mins to an hour, then I take naproxen (750mg) this knocks out the migraine pretty quickly for me, I will just feel pretty washed out for the rest of the day.",Bassie

I took 2 and I didn't experience any relief at all over a 10 hour period. The pills are very large, but the gel capsule made swallowing easier. I wouldn't purchase these again.",Tryingtolove22
10,Naproxen,Headache,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 23, 2019",5,"500mg of prescription Naproxen stopped my daily migraines. I had been  taking over the counter meds non stop all day to try and control them, and I was getting no where.  I had been  spending about $60 per month or more on useless tylenol rapid release or advil liquid gels. I really think they are just a placebo to get people to spend money. My headaches would get so bad I'd throw up or have to go to the emergency. This drug is a miracle for me. I strongly recommend asking your dr for a prescription if OTC meds don't help you either.",staloine66

15,Naproxen,Headache,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 14, 2017",6,"I was just prescribed naproxen 500 mg for degenerative arthritis. It really takes the pain away from the arthritis but it also works for my wife who gets occasional menstrual headaches, migraines  and seasonal allergy sinus headaches. She also takes vistaril for allergies but it doesn't get rid of the headaches. Me personally, only Excedrin migraine extra strength...but that might be the caffeine lol",Adamrocks84

My migraines would last 4/5 days with the first day not able to function at all. I will be looking for a cool, dark and quite room to lay my body in and not to speak.. Since I was prescribed Naproxen 250 mg, I started taking 2 just as I start feeling a tingle of it coming. It doesn't stop it all together, but it eases it. It made my life a lot better. I get a lot less episodes of migraine that don't last long. I also made a change in my life style. I make sure I avoid stress when I can, I do take at least a day when I don't do anything but chill, not even housework. My diet has always been very healthy and balanced so I know it's not it's not that.",DTaggart

21,Naproxen,Headache,9.0,,"January 9, 2016",24,"For the very first time EVER  a medication worked for my migraine. My carrier would not cover the originally prescribed medication, so dr ordered naproxen and sumatriptan. I took it , not expecting much but I was wrong. My migraine felt like day 3 of a migraine.

22,Naproxen,Headache,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 1, 2015",23,"I was suffering from the common cold and had symptoms of dry cough, congested sinus, large headache, slight ear pain, sore throat, and muscle pain in my knees and gleutus maximus. I couldn't eat anything either and at times felt like vomiting. Also, I would wake up in the middle of sleeping, mumbling from my symptoms and pain. And, I would sleep long hours, and no sleep is enough for me. Taking naproxen 220 mg and sleeping that night, I felt 10 times better. The headache was gone, and so was the muscle pain. I slept good that night. I feel like I could do the usual tasks (including eating) now.",MsEgy

24,Naproxen,Headache,10.0,,"August 29, 2015",44,"Aleve (naproxen):Wow has this changed my life. I was a long time sufferer of migraines and headaches. Advil and tynelols are like candy to me now and don't do a thing to relief pain. Even heavy prescribed migraine drugs by my doctor did not work as much as Aleve does! It is simply, for my part, miraculous! It works 99.9% of the time. It works to prevent a headache when I feel it coming. It also works to break the headache or migraine when it is already ongoing and painful. And most of the time, a single pill works. I have to say I really hope my body doesn't come used to Aleve and therefore making it less effective. So far, after a little more than a year taking Aleve, it still is perfectly effective in my case. Don't hesitate to try!",C.Leblanc

28,Naproxen,Headache,10.0,,"July 25, 2015",28,"Aleve (naproxen):My head and base of the neck started hurting three days ago.  The pain also moved from place to place and so abnormal that I scheduled a doctor's appointment...for next week. This pain even made my ""hair"" hurt.  Felt like spots in the central back part of my head had been ""bruised"" and again, the pain location changed from the back center of head to my upper neck to the back of ears and then to the top.  Prescription pain medicine left over from a surgery didn't help.  Last night I took 3 Aleve out of desperation.  Fell asleep and woke up a few hours later feeling much, much better.  Will still see my doctor but won't be a crazy person by the time I get there.",Elise48

I now take 500mg each morning and night a few days before my period is due.  I started taking this preventative treatment of naproxen six months ago.

I generally get migraines during my menstrual cycle and the doctor recommended taking naproxen (500 mg) every 12 hrs of that special week and so far it seems to be working. On other random days if I feel the slightest hinkling of a migraine coming on I take one naproxen and it seems to keep the migraine at bay.
