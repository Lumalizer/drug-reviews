0,5-HTP,Headache,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 27, 2018",21,"5HTP has made all the difference to my life. I have suffered with debilitating menstrual migraines for years, also PMT/depression. This wonderful natural drug takes the edge off it massively and enables me to function much more normally. I take 200mg at night about a week before my period when I feel my head/mood change. About a week after my period when I typically start to feel more normal, I reduce to 100mg. Unfortunately, I can't manage without it now, but it has no side effects so I am extremely thankful for it - it has literally saved my life.",Devon
