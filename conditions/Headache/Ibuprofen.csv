2,Ibuprofen,Headache,10,,"January 12, 2020",7,"Advil (ibuprofen):I get frequent headaches. By frequent, I mean I’ll get at least one every day. I’ve tried a lot of pain relief methods, but not one method or medicine has worked the way Advil has. Advil is a godsend. I’ve been using it when needed for years now. It’s truly the work of the heavens. It clears up my headache in a half hour maximum. For me, I get no side effects that others talk about (nausea, queasiness, diarrhea, etc.) and it works perfectly. I truly couldn’t imagine a more perfect medicine for pain and fever relief in my life. I recommend this medicine and nothing else for pain.",Alexa

5,Ibuprofen,Headache,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 16, 2018",9,I’ve always turned to ibuprofen when I have headaches. It tends to help me by removing the headache in the first place. I recommend you buy the Walmart brand (Equate) because it’s  a good generic brand and it works really well.,Ivanisgreat
6,Ibuprofen,Headache,7,,"January 18, 2018",4,"I get varying types of headaches; migraine, stress, tension, sinus. Ibuprofen works most of the time but tends to take a while to work. And if taken on an empty stomach, will make you nauseous. I recommend using the gel-caps, as they seem to be softer on the stomach.",Joe F
7,Ibuprofen,Headache,4,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 21, 2017",12,"Advil (ibuprofen):I used to take Advil for headaches years ago. I must have taken a lot of it, because I had many headaches.  It worked great at the time. Now I have micro colitis which can be caused from taking to much of this NSAIDS. I really wish Google was around back in the day when I was popping all those Advil! I wouldn't be in the situation I'm in now with my stomach problems!",Darchick
8,Ibuprofen,Headache,10,,"April 15, 2017",5,"Works better than Tylenol or Aspirin for pain and headache.  If I take 800mg within 30mins of the start of a headache, it'll almost always stops it.",Eye _ Doc

10,Ibuprofen,Headache,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 16, 2016",7,"Advil (ibuprofen):Advil is my pain reliever of choice, and I take it occasionally to relieve severe headaches; however, it is not without its (many) faults. For starters, it often takes as long as 2 hours to start acting. Also, it is VERY hard on my stomach—taking even the smallest recommended dose makes me feel queasy and nauseous. I actually prefer the children's Advil, as it has a similar pain-relieving effect without as much stomach pain.Overall, Advil is a worthwhile pain medication, but I would recommend using it sparingly.",pseudonymous
11,Ibuprofen,Headache,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 19, 2016",5,"I get frequent headaches that I would describe as a painful tightening of the muscles in the back of my neck on the sides of the spine, right at the bottom of the skull. It's usually centered there but the pain can radiate to the top of my headIf I take Ibuprofen early enough I can take 3 pills (600mg) but if it's a full blown headache I have to take 4 or 5 depending on the severity. If I swallow the pills whole it can take as long as 45 minutes to work. But pro-tip: you can chew them (unless it is the slow release form). They don't taste bad and they will work a little faster.Great medication. I don't know what I'd do without it. Came here to learn the maximum dose per day. Have not noticed any bad side effects.",Neck Pain Again
12,Ibuprofen,Headache,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 22, 2016",12,"Advil (ibuprofen):I have used Advil (Ibuprofen) for over a year for most headaches. It works like a charm, better than any other medicine I've tried, even ones previous doctors have recommended (my current one does recommend Advil). When I was a kid, I used the children's Advil (chewable), and it still worked great. It didn't taste like grease, unlike most other children's medicine I had. Now as an adult, I still love it. I've never experienced any side effects, nor have I ever had any negative reactions to it. It starts kicking in super quickly, and the headaches don't tend to come back after I take a tablet of Advil. Overall highly recommended, not too pricey (especially for the amount of drug in each capsule and for the number of capsules in a container).",S_KittenLover7172006
13,Ibuprofen,Headache,1,,"February 2, 2016",7,"Advil Liqui-Gels (ibuprofen):STAY AWAY FROM THIS. Took this medication at 5 am when I woke up with a headache. Took an advil extra strength. Shortly after, I was puking my guts up for like an hour. I had an exam that morning too. Needless to say, I failed my exam. Thank you advil. I do not recommend this.",ShawnaL977

21,Ibuprofen,Headache,10,,"January 17, 2011",4,"Had bought 200mg Ibuprofen over the counter today at the pharmacy while receiving my medications. Never did think too much of Tylenol and always did hear the horror stories of Tylenol and liver failure growing up, so as I've become an adult I've weaned towards Ibuprofen. I had a killer headache and took only one 200mg Ibuprofen. Great relief; my headache is long gone. ",TittyPuff
