0,Loratadine,Allergies,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 25, 2022",1,"Running nose allergy symptoms are gone within 10 minutes and keeps working strong for 18 to 20 hours, then by the end of 24 hours symptoms return. One tiny but powerful tablet. The bottle I normally buy is labeled ""CAREALL"", ""Non-Drowsy~24 Hour"" below that in bold larger font,""Allergy Relief"". Inexpensive but identical to the costlier major brand names. I recommend 100%.",StKras
