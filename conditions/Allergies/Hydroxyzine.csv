0,Hydroxyzine,Allergies,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 25, 2022",1,"Everyone responds to drugs differently and I know that I am a rare case, but wanted to share in case I can help anyone. I started noticing heart palpitations when I took hydroxyzine, but I thought that the cause was my anxiety. I then took an antidepressant for anxiety and it made me feel like I was having a heart attack. I had severe heart pain/ squeezing/ radiating into my neck and arm. I ended up passing out and having to call 911. Even after being to the ER and 10 other doctors, I was told that my heart was fine and I just have anxiety. Turns out it was the hydroxyzine causing this the whole time as I found out on my own by googling it. If you see this post and you are having heart side effects from hydroxyzine, you are not crazy! Stop the medicine and your heart will return to normal!",Heart problems
1,Hydroxyzine,Allergies,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 14, 2022",1,My allergist prescribed this for me for itching but I have found that it  significantly reduces chronic pain in my shoulder and back. It does help me sleep through the night as well but I have not experienced drowsiness or memory impairment during the day. I think the medical community should consider this as a possible treatment for chronic pain. I take 20 mg at night as needed.,cate

It’s amazing the itch stopped had I had the most amazing sleep , much needed after all these months ..I slept like a baby .   I was so sleep deprived and in a few days I felt rejuvenated .

3,Hydroxyzine,Allergies,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 29, 2021",1,"I have been taking hydroxyzine for 6 days for itching from my skin condition. I also am not sleeping well because of the itchy skin so I was prescribed this.  I thought great, it will do two birds with one stone since it claims to help both problems. I took it no more than 25 mg, 3 times a day.  It did knocked me out day 1 but only for a short time and did little for the itch. Since then it has been causing terrible insomnia and anxiety for me. Not to mention the medicine head feeling all the time and lack of concentration. I never stop feeling groggy but can't sleep either. I have also experienced jerks or like a feeling of falling while trying to sleep.  And It still hasn't done much for the itch on day 6.  I'm not taking this stuff anymore as of this review. Hopefully I won't experience any withdraw symptoms as it claims it won't  but I don't trust this stuff. I would not recommend trying this medication.",Disappointed
4,Hydroxyzine,Allergies,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 28, 2021",1,Had trouble sleeping due to severe full body itching.   Did it make me sleep? Yes.  Get rid of the itching? Yes. The problem is that lasts 24 hours so you are sleepy all day.  Taking less just makes me less sleepy but still lasts 24 hours.   It is hard being dopey all day.  I just use it when I really need it and then regret it the next day.,Friedturkey

6,Hydroxyzine,Allergies,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 26, 2021",4,I was prescribed hydroxyzine for skin allergies and the dr said it would also help with my anxiety. I take it at night time. I tend to fight insomnia a lot. This definitely helps me sleep. But I’m still waking up a lot during the night. It didn’t help me stay asleep at all. As for skin allergies it does help get rid of itchy hives. But after 8 months of regularly taking one pill at bed time. There are some definite bad side effects. It leaves me very tired most of the next day. I can literally stay in bed most of the day when I take these. I literally don’t feel like doing anything active at all. By that evening when it wears off my anxiety is just terrible. And I find I’m just so hungry then as well. I’m small I usually don’t have a very big appetite. I have gained 25lbs taking this. I’m so disappointed and mad. I will not be using these anymore.,Ncejn287234

So far, it’s helped me not itch my arms and leg as much but the results are not the same for my face which I find odd and might be because I did wet wrap therapy which also helped my body.

20,Hydroxyzine,Allergies,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 17, 2019",6,My doctor prescribed 50mg hydroxyzine to reduce swelling in my hands and feet until he could research my meds to see if they were the cause of the intermittent pain and swelling. The swelling went down after a few days so I decreased the dose to 25mg. After only two doses the swelling came back. I resumed the 50mg. It was not my meds causing this so it’s either idiopathic or genetic angioedema.,Linda

22,Hydroxyzine,Allergies,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 24, 2019",32,"Vistaril (hydroxyzine):My son, who is 33, was given Vistaril, after going to emergency room, with an autoimmune rash, that was flaring up. He was told to take one to two 25mg capsules every 6 hours, as needed for itching. He began acting very strange. I worked, so I was being told of his behavior by his brother and step dad. I told him to stop taking, then I took the pills away, and flushed them. I counted them, and in the 6 days he had them, he only took 5 pills. This is what vistaril did for him, it caused visual and auditory hallucinations, severe paranoid anxiety, extreme dry mouth, tremors, stuttering, and many other things. He thought everyone was trying to kill him, everyone he looked at had rivers of tears running down their face. It is killing me hearing all of it. He’s been very traumatized. Hopefully, he will be able to feel better soon.",Diane
23,Hydroxyzine,Allergies,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 8, 2018",39,"I had a sudden outbreak of eczema after a year of family health issues that caused anxiety--plus the rash was making me more anxious and it itched constantly. I also have sinus allergies. The dermatologist prescribed Hydroxzine HCl - 10mg. and said I should take it two times a day. I took it that first night and slept through the night. By the second day (still took only one 10 mg. tablet), the eczema started to calm down and I simply felt calm myself overall. It has been two weeks now, and the rash is gone and my head is clearer than it has ever been in my life. I am wondering how long I can remain on this drug. I see that others say the effects diminish after a while, but if I stay on this low dose, I am hoping I can stay until all the other issues of family health problems are resolved.  I am wondering if there is a limit to how long one can stay on this drug.  I have no side effects and at present feel it is like a miracle.I am in my 70s.",rz

I am no longer gasping for air or panicking, but this stuff is strong and I slept for 12 hours (though I needed it because I didn't sleep much the night prior).

29,Hydroxyzine,Allergies,10.0,,"September 22, 2017",17,"As for me, I've been struggling with allergic rhinitis and my doctor said it was hereditary so every now and then I have it when triggered with less sleep, stress and poor nutrition. Now to the results, it just works wonders for me since my rhinitis usually pairs with acute bronchitis so it's very hard for me to sleep because my nose is clogged and I have to breathe with my mouth and it can be one of the worst things because my cough would then be triggered by the dryness of my throat. Every time I take Iterax(Philippines brandname) I can finally sleep smoothly without being disturbed and helps with the itchy but hurting throat and clogged nose. Hope this helps.

It's the kind of medicine that relaxes you and clears your tension to the point where it makes you very sleepy. A major side effect of this drug is that it causes drowsiness so it would be best to take it maybe 2 hours prior to your bed time. I also always wake up very hungry and I believe it has something to do with your hormones. It can be taken to reduce anxiety, help insomnia, or maybe even increasing your appetite.

Granted, it does make me feel somewhat sedated. However, that's pretty much a given for all first generation antihistamines. Furthermore, it makes me feel less out of it than Benadryl does.
