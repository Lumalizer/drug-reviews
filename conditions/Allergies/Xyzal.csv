It worked great at first then after about 3 weeks I started getting irregular heart beats and the overall feeling of anxiety.  Which brought me into the ER since the symptoms were getting worse with raising heart rate.  After about a week off the meds I am feeling much more normal again.  Very scary when an allergy meds effects your heart rate!  None of the others I have ever taken gave me this feeling.,Anonymous

OTCs (Allegra, Benadryl, Claritin and Zyrtec had never worked for me. My Dr. recommended that I take Xyzal nightly. Although it’s very effective at controlling my allergies (not eczema so much), I would feel like I was knocked out for 2-3 days. It’s OK now that I am working from home and can sneak in a quick nap, but I would not be able to fully function once I am back to work. Xyzal is best to use Friday nights when you have no plans for the weekend...I plan to cut the pill in half to see how that goes...",Itchy

I took this for three days and needed up having AFib.  My doctors dismissed the possibility of the Xyzal causing this even though it was the only change in my routine.  I was out on Toprol, Eliquis, and Multaq to treat the AFib and referred to an electrophysiologist for a possible heart ablation.  Since they said it was not the Xyzal causing this heart problem, and I started suffering from my allergies again, I decided to take it again.  A few hours later I began having palpitations.  The risk of palpitations, tachycardia and AFib should be included on the label!!",Frustrated

8,Xyzal,Allergies,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 5, 2021",0,"I started taking Xyzal about a month ago, per my allergist's suggestion. All was well for a couple days. No more stuffy nose and itchy eyes. I noticed that I was sleeping more, like getting 9-10 hours of sleep, but needing a 2.5-3 hour nap. I normally get 7 hours of sleep a night. At first, I didn't pay much attention to it.  I am training to run/walk a 5K, so I thought that I was overheating or getting dehydrated.  I moved my exercise times to sunset, but that did not help my sleepiness. For 3 weeks,  I was drowsy all the time and had little interest in anything other than sleep. So now, I'm on my third day of not taking Xyzal. My symptoms have returned, but I feel more awake and like my old self. I don't mind a power nap, but wanting to sleep the day away was not good. I plan to switch to a different allergy tablet, once my energy levels get back to normal.",techlady2021

I noticed that I slept exceptionally well while taking it so decided to add it to supplements I take to ameliorate 4am awakening caused by what I believe is Advance Sleep Phase.  I began to become aware of feeling foggy brained, and it was difficult to ascertain what was causing it because my levothyroxine levels had been lowered by my doctor; subsequently my blood pressure then became quite low: 110/62.  After reading of the effects other have felt, I now believe Xyzal has caused the irritability and drowsiness I have experienced of late.",henriettacarter1

14,Xyzal,Allergies,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 4, 2021",15,"Benefits: This product is AMAZING at clearing up allergies. I have been on many OTC allergy medicines as we recently discovered I was allergic to my dogs. This is the only allergy medicine that beats the itchy eyes, sneezing, and running nose. Downsides: SLEEPY. It takes about 1-2 weeks to get accustomed to this medication. Until then, you are in a fog when awake. For me and my husband, the other downsides are: weight gain and acne. I know that sounds odd but the experience of being on this medication is a very similar feeling as being on a steroid regimen for bronchitis or another illness. You are consistently hungry, your skin feels very oily, and you break out in places you don't normally break out. I gained 5 pounds in one month and my husband gained 10. For us, this was a large enough deterrent to search for other options.",Cass

I took my first pill last night at 10pm & I was asleep 30 minutes later. I slept like a log for 9 hours (I'm usually fully refreshed after 7). I'm also a SUPER light sleeper & my husband said that he got up & made a lot of noise but I never heard a thing. I forced myself awake & felt heavily drugged (like I was only 1 hour into a NyQuil night).Then 2 hours later I was still feeling drugged & napped deeply for 2 hours; I woke up & feel heavily drugged still; Like morphine or Norco has been flooded into my body. My limbs are limp, I want to lay my head back & sleep again. Talking feels hard to concentrate on. I’m holding my eyes open extra wide to keep them from shutting involuntarily.

My allergies haven't improved after 2 doses vs my usual meds. After my first dose yesterday, I noticed feet & ankles were swollen. They never swell! I thought it was odd but attributed it to a short road trip & food we don't normally eat. When it didn't go away after lots of water & rest, I got worried. I took another dose of Xyzal today & again, my feet & ankles are swollen & also tender. My appetite is ravenous as well! Hello red flags!

I mustered you the strength and collapsed in my bed with my towel still on. It is 5pm the next day and I can’t move. It’s like morphine. That’s the only way I can describe it.

30,Xyzal,Allergies,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 16, 2020",51,"I started taking Xyzal  about 2 months ago. For the first week all was well. It helped with my allergies and stuffy nose. After that I noticed my urine turned orange. I thought it was the effect of an antibiotic I was taking, so the dr told me to stop taking the antibiotic. Urine still remained dark after that. Then a cough began that I have had for at least 3 weeks. The final straw was when my face started breaking out with a rash and then my leg. I never thought the medication was the cause of all this until I read reviews from others. I have experienced the depression, the cough, the rash, the dark urine, the fatigue, so now I'm going to stop taking it and hope I can clear up all of these issues. I would say don't take this drug.

120,Xyzal,Allergies,9.0,,"May 24, 2017",15,I have had the worst allergies on record this season. I have tried everything from Claritin to Zyrtec and everything in between. Nothing helped. My post nasal drip was so bad I felt like I had bronchitis from all of the coughing. I even thought I was going to overdose on my albuterol inhaler because I used it so much because I could not breath. A friend recommended Xyzal and brought it to my house one day. The symptoms did not go away all at once but after 2 days on the pill I feel so much better. I take it around 6 pm everyday and I sleep well and wake up perfectly fine the next day. Xyzal has saved me. I hope it lasts and doesn't wear off like Claritin.,Bette_06
