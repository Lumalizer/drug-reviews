0,Sildenafil,Erectile Dysfunction,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 26, 2022",0,"Viagra (sildenafil):Around 57 years old I had a few episodes of performance anxiety and either lost or failed to achieve an erection during sex. I’m in good health, have a strong libido and am very active so I wasn’t ready to give up sex or worry about my ability to perform. Went to my doctor and he prescribed sildenafil 20 mg tablets. I take one from 30 minutes to an hour before sex and I always have a rock hard erection to work with. Refractory time is much shorter and I can do it  twice just about every time. If I’m expecting an extended sex episode I’ll take another tab after my first orgasm. Confidence is back and other women notice. Recently I had a date with another woman and did the deed and she orgasmed 3 times in about 2 hours, came home, went to bed and woke her up at dawn and did it again at sunrise. Got another friend that loves the sex every chance we get and she’s 10 years younger than me. I’m 62 now and this stuff has put me back in my 20’s.l",Sam Elliott
1,Sildenafil,Erectile Dysfunction,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 17, 2022",0,"Who needs a 30-day supply of ""fake"" Viagra every 30 days???? anyway, here we go.... so, I spoke to a customer representative which I was unable to get any assistance with so i was transferred to ""LEA"" (employee# 3056007) which i was told is a manager. she was very rude and uncooperative. no sense of understanding and refused to help me. I assume that I am wasting my time writing this since I have read many negative reviews from Rex md customers online who have been scammed as well. When I tried to post a review on Rex md website and realized that there was no way to post even though I was currently a customer I went on the website and used the ""chat with us feature"" to inquire how to post a review. I was told the website was being worked on that I would have to send my review to them and then they would post it. LOL that way Rex md could screen and only post the reviews that they like....LOL..very frustrating... I figure if nothing else I can copy/paste these letters and post",buck deer

It really is fantastic as it ensures that you can get a full erection quickly and you don’t lose it. Prior to using it I would quite often struggle to get an erection or it would not get fully hard and sometimes part way through love making, I would lose the erection.

I had taken 25 mg viagra and within 24 hours experienced sudden sensonurieal hearing loss (Ssnhl)! I lost about 70% of my hearing in the right ear and alsoexperienced aural fullness (feels as if your ear would be full of water)! I also experienced ringing in the ears, and muffled distorted sounds! I went to my doctor and the emergency department where they injected my inner ear with steroids, as well as put me on high dose prednisone 50mg per day! The injection took place about 3 days after I began prednisone and i was very lucky that i got my hearing back 100% after the injection into the ear! The dr said it was a 50/50% at best! So i just want to warn people that there is a small chance of hearing loss with this and other ED drugs and believe me having healthy hearing is way more important than having firmer erections!",Hearing loss

Although I can still get an erection they weren’t as firm or long lasting over the last couple of years as they used to be.  Cut a 100mg pill in half a decided to dissolve under my tongue to encourage a quicker response.  I was a bit skeptical as to how well it would work.  I’m not anymore.  Only a half hour after the pill dissolved I could achieve an erection on demand without any physical stimulation.  Just thinking of something did the trick.  I’ll be honest I can’t remember the last time just a thought got me fully hard and maintaining my erection.  So extremely happy with results.  I’ve also noticed the effects seem to remain into the next morning as I’ve woken up with morning wood that I was having problems getting rid of.

During my next doctor appointment I discussed this with my doctor and he had some bloodwork done.  A few days later I got a call and my T levels were extremely low and I was referred to  a urologist.  He asked me a very simple question, if I still got morning erections.  I had to think about that for a moment and the answer was no.  Once the bloodwork results proved very low he prescribed Viagra.  The results were immediate but it took me a few months of experimenting to determine when and how to take it.  My erections are back.

My penis stiffened to a hardness not felt since before my accident and stayed that way for almost 3 hours. Amazing, I thought as this was only a trial run and I had no one to share my good fortune.  The effects were still felt for about 48 hours with my normal erection being harder and longer lasting and, I swear my erection is bigger in thickness and length.

The conversation with the Dr. was easy to have and we spoke about the symptoms. He gave me a few options and we decided on viagra to start with.  The doctor prescribed 100mg. With generics now available, I was able to get 30 pills for about $26 from the pharmacy at my local grocery store. I had read reviews and learned about the headaches. I took my first pill with ibuprofen to avoid a headache. About an hour later, things were ready to go. Our first session was great, lasting about 30 minutes and lots of Wows. About 20 minutes later, ready to go again for another 30 minutes. And about 30 minutes after the second session, my wife asked if I was ready for another session, which I was.

It is an wonderful drug but getting the dosage right is critical. I can still get an erection without help but it had become a bit unreliable. I started off taking half a 50mg tablet . It certainly worked but I felt it was just a bit too much.  I now cut tablet into 4 and find a quarter of a tablet makes all the difference and barely gives me any side effects. The half tablet dose was too much for me. It gave a very strong erection but reduced the sensations and gave me a slight headache . So I reckon it's worth experimenting to find the minimum dose you can get away with. (NB the low dose works better on a reasonably empty stomach),Pete

Found Revalto was the exact same drug as Sildenifil Citrate only in 20MG tablets so I talked to my Dr and he wrote me a prescription for 10 of them, which only cost me $3.25  I had been taking the 100MG Viagra so I took 5 each of the 20MG tablets the first time I tried them and that worked like magic again.  Over the past year I've found out that 3 of those 20MG tablets work fine and the only difference I see is they work MUCH FASTER (20 minutes for me) so adjust your ""session"" accordingly!

But when it came down to do business it works great I stay harder longer and don't go soft as quick can satisfy my significant other with great pleasure now.  I am glad I talked to my doctor about my erectile dysfunction. I never would have thought that the VA system would ever give the pill to veterans who have erectile dysfunction. But they do.,armyvet
324,Sildenafil,Erectile Dysfunction,10.0,,"December 1, 2014",29,I never needed Viagra until I was 63 but then I started having trouble keeping an erection. I started taking 20 mg pill a few months ago and feel like I am as strong as when I was 30. Hard to judge when to take pill though because young wife sometimes is just worn out from work. Doesn't matter though because it doesn't seem to get me hard with out some stimulation anyways. Other times even if I haven't taken a pill in a day or 2 I am still able to get my erection.  It is well worth much more. I have read about these guys going for an hour or more. At 63 that would give me a heart attack.,old guy but still alive

I went crazy with this when I first started and took it every day for a week. Lots of fun. But it completely wore me out. No, it wasn't all the sex. It really does affect you in a negative way with too much use. I find increased side effects if I take it near the time of thyroid medicines. I take it once a week or so and it's worth the side effects.",occassional user
383,Sildenafil,Erectile Dysfunction,10.0,,"January 11, 2011",46,Viagra (sildenafil):At 60 I suffered ED after a heart attack.  After three years with a loving understanding girlfriend I decided to try Viagra.   My doctor told me to try 25mg.   All I can say is that it works extremely well for me.  Mild flushing in my face but certainly not bothersome.  The amazing thing is that I can go for as long as I want which makes her extremely happy.  I only see her every couple of weeks so our lovemaking sessions are around three hours long.  Even after an orgasm I can keep going for as long as I want.  The effect lasts about four hours and it worked within one hour for me.Very pleased !,Anonymous
384,Sildenafil,Erectile Dysfunction,9.0,,"January 8, 2011",30,"Viagra (sildenafil):I have tried both Viagra and Cialis. Both have their pro's and con's. I get a better and more constant erection with Viagra. But it took over an hour to start working. The 10mg dose lasted about 4 hours but there was some residual effects afterwards. Cialis started working after about 30 mins and it really carries on for a good 24-36hrs, but the quality of the erection wasn't as good. I suffered with the snuffles with both. I got a headache only with Viagra but it wasn't a bad one though.",Captain Chaos

Spoke to my doctor, who said it probably not physical and to be more communicative to be more relaxed.  Found someone's Viagra pills they left behind, and decided to try one.  Problem solved, and no side effects.  Went back to MD, and was given Levitra (because it's in the formulary) and it works great too.  I take half a 20 mg pill.",Jesus!

No conventional medicines would relieve the pain, sensitivity to light, nausea and lethargy.And, the most disturbing, difficulty swallowing for about 3-4 hours!!I ended up switching to 'Levitra'.  Only a mild headache and some other minor effects for 2-3 hours.  Not quite as good of an erection though (80% to 90% as good).",Anonymous
