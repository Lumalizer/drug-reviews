0,Tadalafil,Erectile Dysfunction,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 18, 2022",0,"Cialis (tadalafil):I will be 70 yrs old in three months and overall in very good condition. I have had ED for about five years or longer. Kind of gave up on intimacies. I finally worked up the courage (I know, how dumb!) to discuss with my primary care physician my ED issue and he prescribed Cialis (Tadafil 20mg) yesterday. I took one yesterday late afternoon for my ""solo trial run"". I did become erect but not rock solid but it sure was better than what I could produce without. However, this morning I was yes, viewing an erotic video and my goodness, I became very erect, like something I hadn't experienced in years. Holy moly! And that was with one tab taken about 20 hrs ago. So like others, I'll follow the science and directions and adjust accordingly.",HappyInAtlanta

And after that, its difficult to re-gain one again once its gone, each subsequent one only lasting under a minute at a time.I commenced on 5mg daily dosing of Cailis just yesterday, and by the mid afternoon I sustained a 40 minute erection without any in between down time.And again later in the evening sustained one for well over an hour, with barely any deflation during that period.If this keeps up, this is truly a wonder drug... and has just saved my sex life!!!THANK YOU!",Benji
6,Tadalafil,Erectile Dysfunction,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 14, 2022",1,"First of all I am 52 years old and started taking this on Wednesday February 2nd. 5 mg daily dose. All I can say is....WOW!! It feels girthier (if that's a word) and am ready to go anytime my wife is. Hasn't been this hard in years. At first I was experiencing severe upper leg pain and some lower back pain. I had to take 2 Tylenol or 2 Advil after about 3-4 hours after taking Tadalafil. Was going to give up on this as the pain was real and very very discomforting (no other side effects though). Ended up walking around the house in the middle of the night for and hour until Tylenol kicked in. Anyway, about a week or so after starting the medication, pain subsided....finally. I love this stuff and my wife was astounded by performance. Not word of a lie, we went from 10-15 minutes intercourse sessions to about 45 minutes. This stuff really works. Highly recommended!",JAC

Took it at 6pm, woke up with a rock hard morning cock, edged and masturbated to a huge amount for about an hour. After about another hour and a half my wife and I got intimate, and wow, with a little bit of stimulation I was rock hard again ! My wife commented on the fullness, thickness and stiffness of my cock and could not keep her hands and mouth off of it. The effects lasted for about a day and a half, slight hot flushes in the face and slight headache but no big deal. Extremely happy and will definitely continue with this medication !",Pete

9,Tadalafil,Erectile Dysfunction,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 29, 2022",1,"I started using generic tadalafil a little over a month ago. It has definitely improved my ability to get better erections, more frequently. What I didn’t expect was that it helps also with improved urination and bowel motility for me. It also seemed to help with a persistent, occasional deep chest congestion/cough I had since I had Covid in November. I take 10mg pretty much every other day, so I’ll take it Monday and then the same time on Wednesday and so on. I drank plenty of water when taking it and did not have side effects other than a little flushing in my face at first. My confidence has been boosted and I’m now wondering if this is something I can take consistently like this or if I will need to take breaks, but I’ll find out as I go.Works as it is supposed to for me and seems to have some other benefits.",Xer

This made it very difficult for me to get an erection with my partner and performance anxiety set in. I was stuck in vicious circle and things went from bad to worse. After a lot of research I decided to try Cialis 10mg. WOW....Life changing. With even just a little arousal I was hard and stayed hard, and 5 minutes after orgasm I was ready to go again and rock solid. I felt 20 years old again and the effects seemed to last at least 48 hours. No bad side effects but I did have a very slight headache which was to me a very little price to pay.

12,Tadalafil,Erectile Dysfunction,10.0,,"January 12, 2022",12,"Cialis (tadalafil):27 year old male. Cialis has my blessing! I tried both viagra and cialis for performance anxiety induced ED when I was seeing this really hot 20 year old girl last summer after not being intimate with anybody for a long time. The first few times we tried to have sex I couldn’t get erect or only partially erect, and although she was very sweet and understanding the embarrassment I felt was unbearable. Both drugs were life savers and great in their own way. However if I took a Viagra I would feel the need to get down to business ASAP after taking it, and felt I would need to time when I took it properly, which would add to the anxiety. It also gave me horrible headaches. With Cialis I could relax, cuddle, and take my time. I was able to do it when I was ready and didn’t have any side effects.",Jack

The reason was because of a psychological erectile dysfunction. First day it was really good. My erections were really amazing. I thought I was gonna change my life. I was so happy at that moment. But it changed for the worse. Fourth day using Cialis 5 mg daily, I had painful erection lasting around 1 hour, then it could get down for half an hour. I was like 8 hours suffering (I could get down my erection, so strictly talking it wasn't priapism, according to doctors). Nevertheless, I couldn't never get back my normal erection. Since that day, it has been like 6 months. Exams show normal structure, but I can't get normal erection now with Cialis. Priapism is a rare adverse reaction to medication.",Xmas

First of all, I've been doing  self injections of testosterone for over 5 years. While that has definitely helped my libido a lot, I've pretty much never been able to get a solid election and even more importantly maintain an erection during sex. Well, while on vacation I met a guy and his wife, who's a doctor at a bar.  Somehow sex became the topic and he just offered that Cialis (Taladafil) is awesome followed by isn't honey! She TOTALLY agreed! When I got back from vacation I asked my Dr for a prescription. I'm on 5mg per day for BPH as well as the ED. RESULT: Incredibly satisfied!!! #1, while flaccid it's bigger and my wife even commented on it. Erections come significantly easier, it's noticeably larger,  and much harder is an understatement! To be clear, it works on demand 24/7. We had sex the following morning and it was incredible! After we were done, she said it looks like you could go again. It's also helped the BPH.

When I hit my early 40s, I saw my doctor and left with a script for daily tadalafil.The second morning after taking it, I woke up to the strongest morning wood I had ever experienced.  Looking down at it reminded me of how my penis used to look and act when I was 20.  It was very full and rigid.  The hardness was intense but completely pleasurable.  My wife noticed it as well.  Standing up, it pointed well north of horizontal.  That hadn't happened in many years. Morning sex was amazing.

Takes usually about an hour to work and I like taking it on an empty stomach with lots of water.  It works so well that you need to be sure you want an erection because your erection might not just go away very easily. I've found that it's almost too easy to get an unintentional erection, like in the shower. That can make for longer showers. Also after climaxing you're pretty much a quick reload so I've sort of learned to treat it like a loaded gun. Don't brandish it, don't point it in the wrong direction. Treat it like it's loaded..Another plus is that it makes my penis fuller when it's not erect and there is something really nice about that. It hangs bigger.

42,Tadalafil,Erectile Dysfunction,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 5, 2021",0,"This review of Tadalafil is for men with Peyronie's disease (curvature of the penis shaft). I have a mild case of the condition which causes me to feel some extra tension in the shaft during a normal erection. Tadalafil allows me to maintain a harder-than-normal erection for 20 minutes, followed by a cycle between fully erect and partially erect for an extended period of time.  Although I do notice some discomfort with the very firm erection, especially during the pressure of ejaculation, I balance that with the success of maintaining a satisfying erection. A man with Peyronie's disease should be aware that the consistently firm erection achieved with Tadalafil may cause pain or discomfort. Your experience may vary, probably dependent on the severity of the penis shaft curve. Good luck!",GW

I get a really strong erection that lasts for the duration of sex. I also last significantly longer before I orgasm and my orgasms are stronger than before. The effects of the pill last for about 24 hours for me before gradually wearing off.

So took the 5 mg about three hrs before having sex with my wife and I have to say it was wonderful. She was surprised and I was too. It's something we have been missing for months although we have been intimate in other touching ways. But to have sexual intercourse that is satisfying for my wife and me is a bonding that makes us even closer. I'm in my late 60s and it's something in our marriage that we had so good in the past, but for the last 6 months and many times even later than that sexual intercourse just didn't happen.

Side effects are minor nasal congestion and headache during the first 6 hours. My primary care provider cautioned me to watch for a drop in blood pressure (dizziness) or an uncomfortable erection.
