0,Cialis,Erectile Dysfunction,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 18, 2022",0,"I will be 70 yrs old in three months and overall in very good condition. I have had ED for about five years or longer. Kind of gave up on intimacies. I finally worked up the courage (I know, how dumb!) to discuss with my primary care physician my ED issue and he prescribed Cialis (Tadafil 20mg) yesterday. I took one yesterday late afternoon for my ""solo trial run"". I did become erect but not rock solid but it sure was better than what I could produce without. However, this morning I was yes, viewing an erotic video and my goodness, I became very erect, like something I hadn't experienced in years. Holy moly! And that was with one tab taken about 20 hrs ago. So like others, I'll follow the science and directions and adjust accordingly.",HappyInAtlanta

4,Cialis,Erectile Dysfunction,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2022",1,"I haven't been able to maintain an erection for longer than a couple of minutes ever since I started on Candesartan 32mg hypertension medication about 3 years ago.Particularly if I've had a couple of alcoholic drinks, but even if I haven't, I've been unable to maintain an erection longer than a few minutes, barely enough time for much of anything. And after that, its difficult to re-gain one again once its gone, each subsequent one only lasting under a minute at a time.I commenced on 5mg daily dosing of Cailis just yesterday, and by the mid afternoon I sustained a 40 minute erection without any in between down time.And again later in the evening sustained one for well over an hour, with barely any deflation during that period.If this keeps up, this is truly a wonder drug... and has just saved my sex life!!!THANK YOU!",Benji
5,Cialis,Erectile Dysfunction,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 28, 2022",3,"I'm in my late forties and for the last year have been suffering from depression. This made it very difficult for me to get an erection with my partner and performance anxiety set in. I was stuck in vicious circle and things went from bad to worse. After a lot of research I decided to try Cialis 10mg. WOW....Life changing. With even just a little arousal I was hard and stayed hard, and 5 minutes after orgasm I was ready to go again and rock solid. I felt 20 years old again and the effects seemed to last at least 48 hours. No bad side effects but I did have a very slight headache which was to me a very little price to pay. My sexual confidence is back and I feel so much better.",Dave Lats
6,Cialis,Erectile Dysfunction,10.0,,"January 12, 2022",12,"27 year old male. Cialis has my blessing! I tried both viagra and cialis for performance anxiety induced ED when I was seeing this really hot 20 year old girl last summer after not being intimate with anybody for a long time. The first few times we tried to have sex I couldn’t get erect or only partially erect, and although she was very sweet and understanding the embarrassment I felt was unbearable. Both drugs were life savers and great in their own way. However if I took a Viagra I would feel the need to get down to business ASAP after taking it, and felt I would need to time when I took it properly, which would add to the anxiety. It also gave me horrible headaches. With Cialis I could relax, cuddle, and take my time. I was able to do it when I was ready and didn’t have any side effects.",Jack
7,Cialis,Erectile Dysfunction,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 30, 2021",1,"I am 22 , I had a prescription for Cialis (tadalafil) 5 mg daily, made by a urologist. The reason was because of a psychological erectile dysfunction. First day it was really good. My erections were really amazing. I thought I was gonna change my life. I was so happy at that moment. But it changed for the worse. Fourth day using Cialis 5 mg daily, I had painful erection lasting around 1 hour, then it could get down for half an hour. I was like 8 hours suffering (I could get down my erection, so strictly talking it wasn't priapism, according to doctors). Nevertheless, I couldn't never get back my normal erection. Since that day, it has been like 6 months. Exams show normal structure, but I can't get normal erection now with Cialis. Priapism is a rare adverse reaction to medication.",Xmas

So I switched to 15 mg Cialis and had great results about 8 hours after taking it. I was a raging bull with a steel rod for about 3-4 days. The following week, I lowered the dose to 10 mg and....... nothing, zero, limp after 8 hours. My new girlfriend was so disappointed that I don't thing she will ever come back. The next morning, I was hard as a rock and could have has sex for hours, but of course, my girl was long gone by then. This was a full 18 hours after popping the 10 mg Cialis. So frustrating. In my case, it seems the smaller the dose, the longer it takes to kick in. I just wanted to share my story and see if anybody else has had a similar experience?",FrustratedInNM

19,Cialis,Erectile Dysfunction,10.0,,"April 20, 2021",76,"A gym buddy told me about cialis.  Started with a 10mg but moved up to the 20mg.  Takes usually about an hour to work and I like taking it on an empty stomach with lots of water.  It works so well that you need to be sure you want an erection because your erection might not just go away very easily. I've found that it's almost too easy to get an unintentional erection, like in the shower. That can make for longer showers. Also after climaxing you're pretty much a quick reload so I've sort of learned to treat it like a loaded gun. Don't brandish it, don't point it in the wrong direction. Treat it like it's loaded..Another plus is that it makes my penis fuller when it's not erect and there is something really nice about that. It hangs bigger. No weird side effects.This sounds sappy but I'm seriously thankful to God for cialis. It makes me feel like a young man again.",Realtor Bob

After FaceTiming and an hour later I felt the emanating buzz of the drug. There were mild side effects that made me shiver slightly but that was temporary and I felt that achieving and maintaining an erection was a lot easier. She called me over in the morning and we tried doing it and it was wonderful.

It was so bad, I could not sleep.  I took pain medication up to and including Tramadol and NO EFFECT.  After 48 hours it finally subsided.  I cannot describe how bad the pain was--I'll just say it was excruciating!  I'm so disappointed because the product works so well--VERY WELL to be exact.  But, now I'm afraid to take it.

32,Cialis,Erectile Dysfunction,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 4, 2020",85,"I shared with my doctor (a woman too) my ED situation for the last 6 months. So she recommended Cialis after asking all the right questions about heart problems if any in my family history etc. All was good. But I personally felt scared about using this, so I cut a 5mg in half and woke up the next morning with an erection. So took the 5 mg about three hrs before having sex with my wife and I have to say it was wonderful. She was surprised and I was too. It's something we have been missing for months although we have been intimate in other touching ways. But to have sexual intercourse that is satisfying for my wife and me is a bonding that makes us even closer. I'm in my late 60s and it's something in our marriage that we had so good in the past, but for the last 6 months and many times even later than that sexual intercourse just didn't happen. She was very understanding but I felt it necessary to try this. It worked and is great. I will continue and try it again soon. Thanks! ~MM",MM

I could get hard easily enough, but I would lose my erection either before sex or during.I've been seeing this new girl for a couple of months now - who I am really starting to fall for - and it had been getting worse so I decided to take some action and went to see my GP. All the blood tests came back normal, so the doctor diagnosed anxiety as the cause.She prescribed me 10mg of Cialis. Last night was the first night I used it and I am so happy I went and saw someone about it. My erection felt so much fuller and harder, and I had the confidence to know it wasn't going away any time soon. Plus an added bonus was how it made me last longer too! I was side effect free during the sex, however I started to get a headache through the night and the following day. A small price to pay for a rejuvenated sex life.
