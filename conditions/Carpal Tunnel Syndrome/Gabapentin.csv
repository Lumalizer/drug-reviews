0,Gabapentin,Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2020",16,I had a very severe case of carpal tunnel the pain was constant it did not go away it was so bad that I had no choice but to go straight to the emergency room instead I was given one 300 mg gabapentin & due to taking that I was able to go to work & I work 12 hrs. a night doing repetitive work in a production line & it was extremely hard work without having any issues with the hands. If it wasn't for the gabapentin I would of not been able to work. I took 2 of two a day 12 hrs apart. I finally had to have surgery.,Mindy
1,Gabapentin,Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 7, 2019",14,I was prescribed gabapentin for a pinched nerve which was causing excruciating pain in my hand wrist and arm. The pain I was experiencing could be equated to Perpetual frostbite. The first four days gradually brought me up to a daily dose of a 600 mg per day. 4 days into that the gabapentin was still in effective and I was simply walking around in a stupor. It did nothing to relieve the pain if anything it seemed to me that it aggravated the pain even more. I slowly wean myself off of it and replaced it with regular aspirin two tabs twice a day and I got more relief from that then I ever got from the Gabapentin. I find this drug ineffective and detrimental to pain conditions,Retired Vet
