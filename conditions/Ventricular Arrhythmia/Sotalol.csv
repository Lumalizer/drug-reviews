0,Sotalol,Ventricular Arrhythmia,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 25, 2022",0,"Not good. I was on Tikosyn and had no side effects after adjusting in a week or so several years ago. Sotolol has done a number on me. I was good before switching to in 2 1/2,months ago. My stomach is a mess with pain, bloating and excessive gas. I have trouble thinking with a moderate headache. I feel like I am in a fog. My ears have always had ringing or tinnitus  but it’s louder now.  It’s all starting to depress me.",Endecooi

2,Sotalol,Ventricular Arrhythmia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 15, 2021",8,Betapace (sotalol):Tried on multiple combination. Cardioversion only lasted 5 days.  Multaq ridiculously expensive and ineffective.Spent 3 days in hospital and with sotalol converted within 2 weeks.  Sinus for almost years and off drug for 6 months. After walk on hot day afib and after 3 doses back in sinus.  Had not had much fluid.  Need to be sure to stay hydrated.  Sinus 2 months again.  Cannot walk more than 10 feet when in afib so great to be back in sinus.  On eliquis and wish they would make generic since approved since 2018 and making almost 5 billion a year off patients ($1600 a month),Vickie
3,Sotalol,Ventricular Arrhythmia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2020",11,"I was on Sotalol (generic) for 2 weeks.  In that time I took two bad falls.  The drug caused serious peripheral neuropathy in my lower legs.  Off the drug, the P.N. disappeared.  For me, this drug was a disaster.",John
4,Sotalol,Ventricular Arrhythmia,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 21, 2020",8,I have been taking sotalol for about 15 years after I had heart by-pass surgery.  My problems are PVCs and tachycardia. Sotalol controls these symptoms very well plus eases chest pains which I occasionally get from exertion. The light blue tablets work best for me. The Apotex brand doesn't last long enough. A  therapeutic dose of sotalol should last up to 12 hours.  The light blue elongated tablets stamped B104 work best for me.,Fasteddy
5,Sotalol,Ventricular Arrhythmia,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 11, 2018",17,"I've been on this medication for 5-6 years. Its true my energy level is not what it used to be when I was younger however at 70 years old I realize I was going to have to live with a new set of circumstances. Things change, life changes.  My doctor added Hydrochlorothiazide (water pill) and I no longer have water retention. I adjusted my life style, take my time more, walk a little slower. Gained some weight but switched to a non-GMO non Gluten diet, walk every day and lost the extra weight. No more knee buckling faints, sleepless nights with rapid and uneven heart pounding anxiety or trips to the ER.  Have also found the original white pill works better than the blue generic. The blue seems to have less original medication in it.  I find I can live with a slower heart rate and lower Blood pressure but also added a protein drink and use a supplement in a bottle of water that contains  electrolytes",Nashville user
6,Sotalol,Ventricular Arrhythmia,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 19, 2017",19,Betapace (sotalol):I've been taking Sotalol for almost 2 years and this pill has drained my energy and I've gained 20 lbs. I quit taking the medicine 3 days ago as the side effects are horrible.,Jkmullins
