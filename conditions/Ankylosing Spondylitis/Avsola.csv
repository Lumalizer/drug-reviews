0,Avsola,Ankylosing Spondylitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 13, 2021",0,"I started my first infusion with Avsola on September 30th, 2021. I have had nothing but side effects since then. I had dizziness, nausea and a headache the day after. Along with heat flashes. Nothing really after that except on October 10th I broke out into hives all over my body and had to go the ER. They gave me a steriod, pepicid and sent me home. By the morning they were gone. On October 12th I was having a dry cough and some wheezing. I was concerned so I saw my primary dr. She ran an EKG and it was abnormal. Another trip to the ER. The cardiologist reviewed and said there were no concern but to follow up in his office for a work up. October 13th I was woken up by a severe pain in my chest that radiated to my back. I got up walked around to see if it would go away. It did but before I got up I noticed I couldn't move my right arm because my shoulder was in severe pain. My jaw felt like I had been grinding my teeth all night. I could barely close my right hand. So I would not do it",Anonymous
