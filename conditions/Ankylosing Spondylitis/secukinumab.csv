0,secukinumab,Ankylosing Spondylitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 26, 2021",2,"Cosentyx (secukinumab):Game changer for me. I have just turned 37 years old and this drug has given me my life back. I played football for over 12 years and was always injured, major back and hip problems then when I stopped GP figured out why. Rheumatologist diagnosed me aged 34 after years of agony. Tried all NSAIDs and nothing, I couldn’t walk further than 0.5km without agonising pain. A fit and slim athletic mother of 3 children to being a cripple. I can now play ball with my kids again, go for long walks etc without any pain whatsoever. Miracle drug for me. I will say it takes a few months to work so please give it time it’s worth the wait",Irish
1,secukinumab,Ankylosing Spondylitis,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 4, 2021",3,"Cosentyx (secukinumab):I wasn't diagnosed with AS until my late 40's. When all the damage is already done, and your Sacroiliac joints are fused together, I guess you can't expect anything to help the pain much. Humira and Enbrel didn't help me much, either. After 6 months it's time to try something else.There are only 3 other Rx meds approved for AS I have yet to try.People lucky enough to be diagnosed at a younger age, should consider getting on a biologic before the damage is already done and it's too late to get any better!",Vince
2,secukinumab,Ankylosing Spondylitis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 22, 2021",2,"Cosentyx (secukinumab):I was on Simponi for 5 years and worked great till it started to wear off and I got psoriasis. So my doctor tells me about Cosentyx and how it will help the AS and psoriasis at the same time. Got me on 150 mg, 5 doses then 1 monthly. Psoriasis worsened, now I am at the 9th dose and back pain is like when I was taking nothing at all. I see 300mg doses are recommended so that is my only hope if they increase the dose. P.S. psoriasis and itchy rash almost gone after treating it with corticosteroid creme. Before that it was just getting worse.",jannyltd

4,secukinumab,Ankylosing Spondylitis,9.0,,"March 3, 2021",12,"Cosentyx (secukinumab):Diagnosed with AS 11-20. Earlier in year I fractured my S/I joint from sports. Over 9 months docs treating me for fractured S/I joint. MRI’s continued to show growing edema up spine.Was on crutches for 6 months. Referred to rheum dr and was told I have AS. After the AS diagnosis, 5 weeks of loading dose (300). After that I went to once a month, still 300. I felt I had immediate positive results, big changes quickly. No need for the crutches. On monthly doses for 3 months.The quick positive changes have slowed down, but still feel better than in 2020. Occasional fatigue but I credit that to lack of activity for over a year. I went from playing competitive sports three nights a week to nothing, so I was out of shape. I’ve had none of the side effects I’ve read on these reviews except some fatigue. I’m willing to continue treatment. Had I read these reviews prior to starting treatment, I may have declined. I’m off crutches and I’m feeling better than I did. I’m in my 50’s.",Scout W

Constant fatigue, stomach problems, terrible stagnation. I couldn’t go normally or roll over in bed. My spine and knees became completely flexed. Convulsions in the legs began.",Paul
6,secukinumab,Ankylosing Spondylitis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 7, 2021",17,"Cosentyx (secukinumab):I started with Humira, had that for 3 years then out of the blue it stopped working. Was then on Benepali and got a allergic reaction to it (eczema under my feet and on hands etc). Was on no drugs what so ever for 4 months after that (and had worst pain ever, even worse than how it was before started with Humira).Then I started with Cosentyx and it has so far -knock on wood- worked great. I am absolutely pain free and have more or less no side effects.'More or less side effects'...I have had the same side effects of all of these drugs (except the allergy). I am fatigued, every now and then I have some bowel problems and headaches. But I can live with that because I am nevertheless feeling better than with no treatment and even the fatigue I get from the disease is worse than the fatigue from the treatment. This disease will never go away and I'm just happy that there are some treatments that actually work",Anonymous
7,secukinumab,Ankylosing Spondylitis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 11, 2020",0,"Had Scapho (Secukinumab) injection for 6 months in India @ 1 per month for Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). While 1st 5 vials gave some relief, my pain restored to original levels after 6th vial. Blood test reports also showed raised inflammation markers.   Sent repeated mails to Novartis, to check on their  serial number tracking or Blockchain enabled supply chain process.  Novartis sent cursory replies upholding their distributors and finally conceded to not having any serial number tracking. Not wanting to waste further money, given this dicey situation, I gave up on Novartis and Scapho injection for good.Since then, my 3 miles jogging + basic stretch exercises every  6 hours along with sulfasalazine tablets have helped.",Victim of Novartis
8,secukinumab,Ankylosing Spondylitis,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 19, 2020",24,"Cosentyx (secukinumab):I've tried Enbrel with no change in inflammatory markers. I was on it for 3 months. I started Cosentyx single injections and my markers went sky high. I was put onto a double injection and my markers went down significantly. I don't feel any relief from pain, never have with any of the millions of things I've been prescribed. But all in all I've had a positive experience with cosentyx. Just wish I could get some help with my pain levels. I have just turned 31, and I feel as though I'm trapped in the body of an 80 year old. Somedays I really struggle with my diagnosis.",Megs

There are times someone had to help me up because I could not do it at all. I am in my 30s there are times I felt embarrassed to get help getting out of the chair. I got diagnose with AS in December. I started Cosentyx in February 2020. I been on Cosentyx going on three months. I feel like I have my life back. I do yoga and I am trying to do Pilates. I am finally free from the pain!,TC
10,secukinumab,Ankylosing Spondylitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 23, 2020",56,"Cosentyx (secukinumab):I think these reviews need to be taken in context...most people rarely post positive comments about drugs, they are just to busy getting on with there lives,  the people who have negative reactions are far more likely to post (and I feel deeply sorry for those for who it has not worked for)For me it’s been a life changer...I was on anti inflammatory meds, and sulfazalazine before, no anti-tnf. I started to feel better within 4-5 weeks of first injections (taken weekly). Now...no more aches and pains...no stiffness..this literally has been a miracle cure for me. I think it’s much more effective if you haven’t been on anti-tnf or similar before.",Tim

Since switching to Cosentyx my ankylosing spondylitis symptoms have worsened x 10.  I have no movement in my neck, constantly eating pain killers and anti inflammatory drugs besides taking Cosentyx itself.

I was told that it is a brilliant medication which after researching it its not at all. Was on Enbrel for 12 years and it worked very well till they put me on Benepali  (etanercept in UK) then after 3 months back on Enbrel brand which just didn't seem to work anymore and now on secukinaumab. I feel like rubbish, I've got mouth sores and stomach just feels sore and very bloated. Drs will prescribed you anything when they get bonuses from prescribing it.

Doc gave me a 150mg injection of consentyx 1 week post 200 mg Remicade infusion. Stared shaking uncontrollably for an hour followed by chills until early morning.  Then the whole body itching and runny nose started followed by hives near the injection site.  My eyes were the worst and wouldn't stop itching and I started wheezing with each breath. Took almost 30 days for the symptoms to stop. Told the doc and she thought it was just a cold and wanted to continue cosentryx.  Absolutely no way I would take it again. Back to Remicade. Tip-what also helps my AS is doxicyline-100 once per day.  Try it.",pas2

Joints swollen, which never happened before. And the worst part 3 bouts of upper respiratory infections, last one is now pneumonia.  Doc says at first not the Cosentyx...but it's a side effect I say.
