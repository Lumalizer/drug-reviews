1,Etanercept,Ankylosing Spondylitis,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 1, 2021",0,"I'm lucky as a U.S. Veteran the VA has been covering my officially priced $4800 etanercept for over 10 years.  It is a wonder drug, working as well now as when I started.  Nothing else worked by that point.  Etanercept took a couple weeks to start showing effects then the pain quickly went away and almost all of the red plaques followed over the next few months.   Thanks to colds, shipping issues, and etc.  I've found you can miss a couple 1 to 2 week periods a year without any noticeable loss of the benefits.  However thanks to a major SNAFU I once went more than 3 months without taking etanercept.  The symptoms kicked in at 2 and a half months.  The pain disappeared  within a day upon resuming the medication but some of the new plaques I gained at that time stayed and the two old plaques that never went away in the first place got a lot worse.  It is not a cure, but after 10 years I am still functioning well enough to work and hit the gym (low impact).",maz

At first it worked well with no adverse reactions. About 1 1/2 years ago I began developing stomach issues. Eight months ago those issues were diagnosed as Crohn’s disease.

For a few years, I would take Enbrel to help with the pain but stopped during the flu season. This past year, I stopped taking Enbrel altogether because it was becoming less affective.

I finally came across a Nurse Practitioner who prescribed me vitamin B injections (twice a week), vitamin D (once a week), and Folic Acid  (Deplin - once a week).

Even taking these potent drugs I was still with pain and problems as they only masked the symptoms. Within 6 hours of my first shot I was pain free and within 2 weeks was playing tennis again. I must say though that I do get sharp pains in my feet occasionally and I have put on about 20 lbs . all on the lower belly which my rheumatologist told me was a possible side affect. Another thing is my finger joints feel weaker and am having a bit of insomnia. But being pain free has helped my quality of life.

I then went on to try Simponi, which improved my physical condition dramatically within the first day of the injection, however seemed to have a psychotic effect on my brain over the couple of months of been on it.

I don't walk around like an old man any more (I'm a 37 year old female) and I can do yoga, aerobics, etc. The only side-effect I have noticed is about 10lbs weight gain over the past year, but I am going to work on more exercise/less evening snacking and see if that can keep it in check. At least now I have the energy to exercise when I need to. Before it was too daunting.",stephieduck
