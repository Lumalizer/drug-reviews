1,Celecoxib,Ankylosing Spondylitis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 26, 2020",6,Celebrex (celecoxib):Didn't help me !,Flowergal
2,Celecoxib,Ankylosing Spondylitis,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 14, 2020",6,"Female diagnosed with Reactive Arthritis 2014 some doctors label it Spondyloarthritis. Whatever, it is horribly painful. Methotrexate made me sick as a dog. Other nsaids tore up my stomach.Celebrex works if I take it daily. 400mg a day allows me to move, function and look like nothing is hurting me everywhere. My experience over the last 2 years is this; After 7-10 days of taking only 200 mg Celebrex a day culminates in a massive level 8 pain flare-up. It must build up in the system. I do not skip mid-day dose for more than 3 days. Liver and kidney lab tests show all is good. I do get infrequent minor heart palpitations that could be from anxiety or could not. Key inflammatory markers are over the standard range regardless so I can’t say it is a miracle drug. Without it, I’d pretty much feel like I did before going on a powerful biologic. I also found a 8-10 pound weight gain at this high dose. C’est la vie. Think of it as a sacrifice for the greater good.",Charmz
3,Celecoxib,Ankylosing Spondylitis,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 5, 2017",19,"Celebrex (celecoxib):Works well, been on it for years so may becoming immune.Not all generic versions are as good as Pfizer, I nearly came to a total stop after taking generic version for a few weeks, gone back to genuine ones and noticed change within 24 hours. If you get plain white capsule with Y 100 written on it expect trouble. I am in UK.",hpxd
4,Celecoxib,Ankylosing Spondylitis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 27, 2015",32,Celebrex (celecoxib):Diagnosed 1.5 years ago. Was on Mobic for a year until it became somewhat ineffective in my left hip to the point where I could barely walk. Switched to Celebrex which is doing a lot better.. have been taking it for 6 months but I know long term effects of NSAIDS are damaging so trying no starch diet to get off NSAIDs..so far little success but need to stick to it for much longer.,Sydney25
