0,Aleve,Ankylosing Spondylitis,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 9, 2019",6,"I was prescribed by my Rheumy to take Sulfasalazine 500 mg tab 4 times a day since October 2018, when I was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis. I have also taken Naproxen 375mg as needed. I’m a 72 years old woman still working full time in front of a computer all day and sometimes my back and neck pain is unbearable. The only thing that reduces my pain is taking Aleve gels before I leave for work as Sulfasalazine nor Naproxen have done enough.",Fini
1,Aleve,Ankylosing Spondylitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 21, 2018",7,"I have AS and have been in a flare up for about a week now. Hurting from my pelvis to my feet, it was causing extreme difficulty with walking.  Haven’t wanted people to notice the few times I’ve had to get out of the house so would walk decently with excruciating pain. My feet have been hurting everywhere, with painful throbbing and stabbing pain with every step.  I have been feeling shocks in my left hip area with my steps, almost sending me to the floor at times.  Last night, after I got in bed, the throbbing pain was keeping me awake so I got up and took two Aleve gel tabs.  Within 30 min, while lying in bed, I noticed the throbbing had stopped.  Upon awakening and standing I was much better.  I could not believe the difference in my gait with my pain level dropping significantly today.  I feel so much better now!  Thank goodness",Pud

3,Aleve,Ankylosing Spondylitis,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 8, 2012",29,"Works very well for back pain especially when it also affects the surrounding muscles. But, you should always take it after a meal as it can cause serious stomach pain.",Anonymous
