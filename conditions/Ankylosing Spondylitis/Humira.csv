0,Humira,Ankylosing Spondylitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 6, 2022",0,"I have been suffering from bilateral inflamed knees for 20+ years on and off flares including intermittent back n hip pain. All docs told me was that I had inflammatory arthritis and just needs to be managed with Nsaids, exercise, diet and weight loss. Recent episodes of higher inflammatory markers and uveitis led to diagnosis of Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). Started Humira 3 weeks ago and knee swelling reduced quite a bit on day 4 after the 1st injection. Back and neck pain have reduced significantly too. Small prick and nausea been the only side effect so far. The benefits outweigh the side effects by miles. Only concern is long term use and fear of it losing efficacy.",Anonymous

My rheum decided I need a biologic, so tried Humira first. After 12 weeks of use, absolutely no benefit (sometimes I wonder if I'm worse than before starting it), so we decided to change medication. No side effects either at least.",duduqa

3,Humira,Ankylosing Spondylitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 10, 2021",0,Absolutely amazing for my ankylosing spondylitis. I had moderate to severe pain constantly for the last 8 years with constant nerve pain and inflammation in my hip from my sacroiliac joint and lower spine which occasionally flared up in my neck and across my spine at chest height. This caused my ribs to inflam and my chest plate which wasn't good for breathing or when I had a constant chest infection which I think was due to dmard immonosuppressents flaring it up constantly - plus they didn't help my suspect IBS and crohn's which is common with anky and unfortunately I suffer from them all. I was diagnosed properly in 2017 thankfully.I started on Humira 5 months ago I was so scared I gave it a chance but it's been the best thing for me I have no inflammation and no nerve pain it's gone completely.I inject every 2 weeks and it took around 4 injections to work fully. I notice by day 12 sometimes I'm fatigued a little bit ready for the next and then I feel amazing.,Uklad

5,Humira,Ankylosing Spondylitis,10.0,,"June 22, 2021",6,"I was skeptical about going on this medicine due to all the possible side effects. It came to a point where I felt defeated because my quality of life was very poor. Long story short, I’ve experienced chronic widespread pain since I was about 18 years old. I was not even able to sleep for more than a couple hours at a time because my spine and shoulder blades were so inflamed. The pressure from lying on my back was unbearable. The chiropractor, acupuncture, physical therapy and intensive workout routine, nor the strict diet helped my pain. If anything the exercise definitely decreased it. Anyways, within the first couple weeks of my first dose (Memorial Day 2021) I was still super stiff, so I had to continue my regime with Celebrex 200mg 2x day. After my second Humira injection, within about 24-48 hours I felt TOTAL RELIEF. I was no longer skeptical about the medicine and something told me my body needed it. It has only been 3 weeks on Humira but I can tell you I am impressed!",WCal291

The first 3-4 injections (taken biweekly, so 6-8 weeks) I wanted to stop taking it because the side effects were terrible. I’d have hot flashes, I’d be sweating but freezing, my hairs would stand up after taking injection, I’d throw up, wake up super sweaty. But after that 2 month period, WOW IS THE DIFFERENCE AMAZING. I have AS, I also have 2 replaced hips, and a left knee that also needs replacing. I’ve been dealing with this for about 8 years and ever since humira has came into my life it’s been so much better.

After going on humira, I was  99% better, it really worked. Side effects of Humira for me are, skin cuts take a bit of time to heal and skin fungal infections on two toes where joints touch- these are a minor inconvenience. But now I run 5km every day again and play golf and can walk and can dress myself. One year plus of heaven. Thank you Humira and medical science.",P

11,Humira,Ankylosing Spondylitis,10.0,,"August 3, 2020",36,"It has been about a year for me taking Humira. I was actually quite concerned before starting it as I read all sorts of reviews claiming stuff like getting cancer and such and I almost didn't take the drug out of fear. Having suffered from Anklylosing Spondylitis for a better part of 15 years and trying everything from different kinds of pain killers, muscle relaxants, chiropracters to months of physio therapy, I had just learned to live with back pain and dreaded it every morning. Humira has been a miracle drug for me so far. I haven't had any pain whatsoever since the first two weeks of starting it. Blood work is all normal and haven't had any reactions or side effects other than some redness on the area where I inject it. The pain from injecting was also way exaggerated in the reviews. It is a little painful but 5-10 secs of light pain is nothing compared to the relief it provides.",TJ

There were zero positives for me while taking Humira.  Even though I quit Humira awhile ago, all of the negative symptoms Humira caused still continue on. Now I have Ankylosing Spondylitis.... + daily headaches, extreme fatigue, constantly feel like I have the flu, way more back pain than before, constant vertigo, and psoriasis all over my scalp and jawline!  I vomit a little bit in my mouth every time I see one of those ridiculous Humira commercials on TV.Humira was free for me thanks to the Canadian government and my insurance.  I can’t imagine actually paying for this horrible drug. My heart goes out to anyone in the US that must pay out of pocket to play Russian roulette with their health by trying Humira.  I wouldn’t use Humira again if someone paid me a million dollars!  Absolutely the worst experience of my life.",HumiraSucksBallz

My back was so bad that I could not walk normally (I had to walk like I had something shoved up my butt). They put me on Humira and I felt immediate relief. I was able to walk normally and even began running again. It’s been 5 years now, and I’ve gotten many colds but nothing serious. It allows mobility, which alleviates the pain. On no other meds so far besides acid reflux medicine. Very thankful, but still scared after every blood test. My quality of life has improved greatly.",JBR
16,Humira,Ankylosing Spondylitis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 19, 2018",31,"I resisted taking this drug for at least a couple of years, but finally gave it a try. Sulfasalazine didn't do all that much by itself. After about 3 months, the pain was significantly lessened. I could walk much easier, the back pain much lessened. After about a year, shingles. Oh, joy. About 3 months after that, huge, ulcerated sores started developing. No one could explain what they were. Copious drainage, would not heal. Completely stopped taking Humira at that point. Took 2 months to stop new sores  from cropping up. Every single one is still present, 4 months later, in various stages of healing. Do NOT take this drug if you have ANY other option. I shudder to think what it's doing or has done that I don't know about yet.",Kim

Was on it a few months and ended up with lowered immune system and several illnesses because of the humira. My doctor took me  off of it and then quit working where I live . New doctor hasn't wanted to risk medication similar to this yet. Good points are it helped my pain disappear almost completely. Bad point it also made me extremely tired at first.,Sara

I also had an allergic reaction at the injection site.  Hot, red and swollen, the size of a melon on my stomach.  Had to have steroid to get it to go away.  Bad drug.",Jan
19,Humira,Ankylosing Spondylitis,1.0,,"July 15, 2018",36,"Took humira for AS and it worked great the first month and my pain went down to a 1.  By month 6, I had contracted klebsiella pneumonia from my lowered immune system from this drug and a subsequent systemic candida infection.  That was 10 years ago and I still have severe systemic candida from this poison.  Nothing has helped...antifungals work but only temporarily because Humira permanently changed my immune system.  I am now on permanent disability because of having to cope with both my original illness as well as the devastating effects from this DNA altering drug. People...Abbotts labs does not care about you...only their bottom line and making billions. Humira is now black labeled meaning you take it at your own risk and Abbott labs will not be responsible if you get infections or cancer from it because you were warned by their label....",Neo

My pain in my back neck and ankles was unbearable at times, & the exhaustion was horrible! I quit my job of 17 years because I could no longer stand for hours anymore. After many medications that didn’t work and made me very sick.  Last week I started Humira and noticed a huge difference by the next morning. I am no longer exhausted.

21,Humira,Ankylosing Spondylitis,,,"February 14, 2018",24,I took Humira for about 20 months. I was taken off it at my doctors recommendation. I have developed psoriasis from this drug. Thanks Humira. While on the drug I still had stiffness and I actually feel the same if not better now that I am Humira free. Experienced headaches and extreme fatigue while on Humira too. Presently just on Sulindac and feel so much better. The drug is outrageously expensive and the Complete plan covers most. The company called me about nine times in regards to 2018 and checking my insurance plan. Interesting that they have not inquired as to why I am not taking the drug anymore. Perhaps they don’t want to add my Humira side effects to an updated stats. Be careful what you put into your body!!,Fitgal

After 1st injection, it took only 5 days and got symptoms of flu. Flu developed into chronic sinutitis and come-go laryngitis. Next episode was super high blood pressure and frequent urination 24/7. Third one was more serious, white blood cell count began to rise. This is not normal (may lead to blood cancers or lymphomas) and Humira was stopped.

Because Humira is so expensive they made me use NSAID's like diclofenac and naproxen for two years. Before I used humira I dropped out of college, couldn't do any sports and was bed ridden most of the day. If I would for instance do the dishes, I would be broken for the rest of the day. A little over two years ago they started me on Humira and it has completely changed my life.

I only inject about once a month even though I am suppose to use it once every two weeks.  It works well, but I am concerned about side effects.  I got Shingles once after taking the shot.  I am assuming because it lowers my immune system.  However, it is  worth the risk overall and significantly has reduce my pain and pretty much stopped the  progression.

Being very tall (6'4) many of the issues were put down to my tallness. When the back pain started affecting my breathing I knew something more that being tall was a play. After a number of differing referrals, I was finally passed to a Rheumatology specialist who spotted my symptoms very quickly and suggested my treatment. It took over a month to get the test results and approvals but when I started treatment the results were within a week for me.Now I have next to no pain and I have no real symptoms. The injections are uncomfortable but for 10 seconds of pain for 2 weeks of being able to move and breathe without being in pain is worth it.",Velta12

The non-starch diet with some exercise did help bring the pain to what I would call manageable but flares would still happen and with them would come several day cycle of poor sleep, less exercise, and so on.My rheumatologist explained that some new research suggest Humira may actually help to stop the progression of the disease so I gave it a shot (pun, hah!).It took about 3 weeks to start kicking in and by week 5 my symptoms were totally gone.

I have been on numerous NSAIDs, the only one which was successful in pain control was Celebrex, which they also denied approval.  I have not gotten the safe effect from the methotrexate and naproxen, in fact, I have never felt this bad even before the Humira.
