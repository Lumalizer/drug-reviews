I am currently off for a week prior to surgery on knee. Rheumy gave me prednisone but doesn’t help. This drug makes my life normal, w/o I am a cripple. I also take sulfasalazine but don’t notice that it helps.",Hurting
1,Diclofenac,Ankylosing Spondylitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 9, 2021",9,"Works better than hydrocodone + Acetaminofen for Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) Pain.I take one  100mg Diclofenac SR and after 30 Minutes the pain goes slowly away and I can move my neck (cracks and pops).Also it relieves pain almost the whole day, best pain reliever I have found  for AS.",Wolf
2,Diclofenac,Ankylosing Spondylitis,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 13, 2019",6,"I started taking 50mg  diclofenac twice a day for neck pain (arthritis). It has helped my pain immensely but I have experienced periodic times of feeling a bit ""off"", more tired and some periodic heart fluttering. I wonder since it is a time release pain reliever that when it kicks in that is when I feel off or the heart flutter. I have not had any stomach pain and it definitely helps my neck pain. My doctor wants me to try Relafen/Nabumetone to compare them.",Susy
3,Diclofenac,Ankylosing Spondylitis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 29, 2018",9,Great drug for easing the pain but not a long term solution. It is so frustrating when doctors have no idea how to treat AS. I have tried Diclofenac and it is brilliant and completely cured me with no noticeable side affects however long term it wears away your stomach wall and is not good for you. I weaned off it with pain killers and regular exercise and have one every time I have a flare up to even me out again. Will discuss enbrel with my doctor as a lot of people have recommended.,ozzy

It started in my lower spine 42 years ago. After recently having had a bacterial lung infection for a 5 weeks, and walking about 3 kms when I was well again, the pain all over was excruciating.

5,Diclofenac,Ankylosing Spondylitis,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 5, 2016",7,"My trial with Diflucanec has been approx eight weeks now and it has eased my lower back pain. However, my liver enzymes have spiked, my urine output is in large volumes, and my  upper back has a  irritable rash cascading  on it.

7,Diclofenac,Ankylosing Spondylitis,10.0,,"September 16, 2015",13,I use Voltaren since I was 30 years old due to ankylosis spondylitis pain . I am now 56. I use to take 100 mg  SR per day. For the last 3 years I have reduced to 1x50D mg  per day and really feel very comfortable. I found it very effective and  I didn't noticed  any side effects yet. I think that Voltaren helped me to keep my ankylosis under contol. Doctor told me to avoid using it for so long but the pain was coming back the next day. I don't know what problems I may face in future but my life quality is good and I am happy.,Louisg19
8,Diclofenac,Ankylosing Spondylitis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 15, 2015",17,"Absolutely changed my life. I got progressively worse until I would become so stiff after sitting for fifteen minutes, I would need help in standing. While nobody who sees me walking would mistake me for an Olympic athlete, I can move about freely and almost without pain. The best thing it gave me was uninterrupted sleep. Until I started taking this med, I could not sleep for more than a few hours without getting up with tears in my eyes from the pain, and walking around while chewing aspirin.",Capt. Ken

I was started on Ibuprofen, but had to up the dosage. My GP changed me to Diclofenac (50mg 2x daily) but I didn't find it effective. I went back to 100mg 4x daily Ibuprofen which was much more effective for me. I had no side effects while taking it.",efan78

If I come off it for a couple of days my joints start to really ache. I had torturous night pain for a while as I got a spontaneous fracture in my pelvis due to swelling in my bones and Voltaren was the only thing that worked. I've had no noticeable side effects.,Kbkk
