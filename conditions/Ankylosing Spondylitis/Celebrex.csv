1,Celebrex,Ankylosing Spondylitis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 26, 2020",6,Didn't help me !,Flowergal
2,Celebrex,Ankylosing Spondylitis,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 5, 2017",19,"Works well, been on it for years so may becoming immune.Not all generic versions are as good as Pfizer, I nearly came to a total stop after taking generic version for a few weeks, gone back to genuine ones and noticed change within 24 hours. If you get plain white capsule with Y 100 written on it expect trouble. I am in UK.",hpxd
3,Celebrex,Ankylosing Spondylitis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 27, 2015",32,Diagnosed 1.5 years ago. Was on Mobic for a year until it became somewhat ineffective in my left hip to the point where I could barely walk. Switched to Celebrex which is doing a lot better.. have been taking it for 6 months but I know long term effects of NSAIDS are damaging so trying no starch diet to get off NSAIDs..so far little success but need to stick to it for much longer.,Sydney25
