It started in my lower spine 42 years ago. After recently having had a bacterial lung infection for a 5 weeks, and walking about 3 kms when I was well again, the pain all over was excruciating. I had a Voltaren injection 5 days ago and have been pain-free since then. No side effects at all.",St Cheri

2,Voltaren,Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 4, 2013",33,I have been taking Voltaren for Ankylosing Spondylitis for six months and it really keeps me fully functional. If I come off it for a couple of days my joints start to really ache. I had torturous night pain for a while as I got a spontaneous fracture in my pelvis due to swelling in my bones and Voltaren was the only thing that worked. I've had no noticeable side effects.,Kbkk
