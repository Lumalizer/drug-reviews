0,Taltz,Ankylosing Spondylitis,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 9, 2022",0,Was recently on Taltz for 6 months.  It always been a hassle to order the next dose every month so sadly in November of 2021 I could not return calls and skipped that dose.  But then in December they started calling again and always when I had zero time to go through the 15-20 minute rubbish in order to get my prescribed med.  So now January and I am starting to feel my AS symptoms coming on but a million times worse than I hav ever experienced.  I have been on just about every other biologic.  Never an issue once I stopped those.  Is it possible that Taltz has a sever withdrawal problem.  Has anyone else experienced this after stopping Taltz?  My pain is so bad and my nerves are irritated through the roof.  I am short with people and can’t get good sleep.,Kracker55
1,Taltz,Ankylosing Spondylitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 17, 2021",1,"Took the loading dose, two injections 160mg on Thursday an started a flair on Saturday with severe lower back rt hip and rt shoulder pain. By Tuesday had to start prednisone. Is this a fluke, does it take time to work? How much time? When I started humira in February, I instantly had a decrease in pain and was absent from pain for 4 months. Unfortunately I had to stop humira due to new onset of exercise induced asthma which is an adverse side effect.",DeeC
2,Taltz,Ankylosing Spondylitis,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 10, 2021",5,"I am on 4 th day and feel less burning, sharp neck pain and less body pain that's been constant for 5 years. I tried Humira, Cimzia and Embrel and they all made me feel flu-like with no pain relief. I am praying that I can keep waking up and not suffering all day. I am so excited that I might have my life back and think I cracked a smile this morning.",Anonymous
3,Taltz,Ankylosing Spondylitis,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 6, 2020",6,"I’m on Taltz about a month now. My insurance chose it for me (which shouldn’t be legal). The pain of the injection pen is silly high. Then you get lumps at the injection site. The joint pain has been much worse than the last medication. Really bad blurred vision. Neck, shoulder, and arm pain. I don’t recommend it but I’m so glad it worked for a few on here. I haven’t had my liver checked but I’m going to be careful with it. It’s hard to believe anyone would feel better on this.",Tee
4,Taltz,Ankylosing Spondylitis,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 2, 2020",29,"After a long streak of feeling good on Enbrel which wore off after 9 years tried a round of alternatives. Failed results For the last 3 years from Humira, Cosentyx and Cimzia from likely being too adjusted. Pleasantly surprised by early improvements on Taltz. Hoping it sustains. Only 3 months in but felt obligated to share early positivity that I hope will sustain and grow. Definitely took the 3 months to feel improvements which have lasted 1-2 weeks/month.",Rob
