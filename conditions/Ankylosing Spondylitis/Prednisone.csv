0,Prednisone,Ankylosing Spondylitis,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 13, 2019",6,"I have a long list of autoimmune disorders, chronic migraines, neuropathy, stenosis, sciatica, 6 bulging discs and more. My back flares up so bad I can't walk at all. I love this medication because with in a few days I feel normal again but I've gained 15 pounds now in 5 days and I'm not even eating. The weight gain is horrible. Otherwise I highly recommend it.",DontLookSick
1,Prednisone,Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 21, 2017",5,Fontein I totally agree with you.  The prednisone takes away the pain immediately.  Just a damn shame of the side effects...I gained 50 lbs in a month.  They was to try this Celebrex but on day 3 no relief and I refuse injections .  I prefer a pill.  Its sucks that people in this world abuse opiates cause they helped also.  What else are you on for the pain?,painfree746
2,Prednisone,Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,,"September 16, 2015",26,"Having AS and osteoarthritis since childhood and now 52 years of age I have tried just about anything and prednisone not only relieves the pain, but my whole body feels more flexable and I find I have more energy. I was on it while awaiting a knee replacement, but was pulled off it, Went through the roof. Went back on until my Rheumatologist weaned me off in prep for the knee surgery. But what I cannot get through to the doctors is I'd rather have the best life I can, be it long or short. I want to live and prednisone gives me that. I have reached the stage where if they will not proscribe it, i'll buy it on the net, but life is too short to live it in unbearable pain.",Fontein
