0,Azithromycin,Sinusitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 27, 2022",0,"I had taken this for my third time, but I spoke to soon, yes - it did help clear my throat issue, but I came to find out I have chronic sinusitis and it did nothing to cure that so I was back to square 1. I have come back on here to report a crazy side effect which I would not categorize as rare, but common (and not even sure if it is mentioned in the fine print). I woke up in the middle of the night with my ears buzzing and ringing so loud! This was seriously freaky to me and scary, but I chalked it up to the fact I was dehydrated or maybe it was working hard to get rid of the ear infection I had. I drank a cup of water and then closed my nostrils and blew out to pop my ears open and that helped and I did not have the ringing again, thank goodness. Therefore, I do believe longterm consistent use and/or abuse can definitely cause an ear ringing problem, but if you take just your dose, this isn’t going to be an issue that stays. I still think this is an amazing drug and I do trust it.",Updatedreview

It definitely did it’s job, but oh my GOD. The worst stomach pain I’ve ever had in my life. I NEVER get side effects from medicine and I have had to take quite a good amount, but wow this was bad. I have no idea why I reacted with this antibiotic, but it was so bad that it would last the entire day any time I ate and I was afraid to eat on it. And I never have stomach issues so this was very hard for me. It does what it needs to, but I won’t lie it was some of the worst pain I’ve ever dealt with.",Gabby
4,Azithromycin,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 5, 2021",0,I get sinus infections a few times a year when the seasons change and my allergies get so bad that it turn into a sinus infection due to my deviated septum. Bacteria gets trapped in my sinus and sneezing starts then within a few days I have a sinus infection. They get so bad that I can't function during my job or taking care of my family. I'm 47 and a zpack is the only thing that works for me. I can't OTC meds like Sudafed due to being allergic or nasal sprays cause severe migraines. This medicine works within the first day.

5,Azithromycin,Sinusitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 4, 2021",0,"I was prescribed this antibiotic at a clinic for a possible sinus infection. I had taken previous antibiotics in the past, such as Cefdinir, and they never really affected me as much with side effects. I had to take 500mg of Azithromycin on the first day, and then 250mg for the next 4 days. I took it after eating a dinner and felt fine. The next morning, I felt incredibly nauseous not too long after waking up. I tried to eat as much as I could but the nausea still persisted. It didn’t really go away until about day 3 of taking the drug. Now, I have finished all the pills, and as nauseous as the antibiotic made me, my sinusitis has almost completely cleared up. My congestion is minimal and I’m not blowing my nose as much. I will say that I’m experiencing some diarrhea after finishing all the pills on day 7, but that could be just me eating spicy food when it’s probably not a good idea. I totally recommend this drug, just watch for any side effects that may become major.",Evie

I know one day more for the last pill would be silly to stop but I just can’t handle the side effects any longer. The brand that the pharmacy gave me this time is a different brand so that may have something to do with it, the pharmacy I used for years has closed down so the other one has different pills or brands for the same meds.

Sometimes I’d get a little stomachache or minor diarrhea with  the first dose. That’s all for side effects. The medicine still works good but I have to use the 5 day pack twice to knock it out the last few winters or it comes back. It must be the resistance. I’d use this over others any day.,Christine80

Generally, no side effects, other than some stomach upset, a sometimes slight nausea.
