0,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 1, 2021",0,"A week ago my throat was bad around my neck, I took the amoxil 2 days, After eating amoxil, my mind closed as if someone had locked it in my fist... There is no change so far The finally doctor gave me neurobion and repicort also has a timely effect then the head becomes heavy again and again... I don't know what to do,",asma
1,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 6, 2021",0,So I was given amoxicillin 500 mg by my doctor for a severe sinus infection. Two days later and I now have severe tooth pain. I don't understand how I went from one problem to the next. Is it from the antibiotic?,Xenite
2,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,10.0,,"December 13, 2020",0,"I took this medication amoxicillin for a sinus infection / tooth infection after a root canal. I was so extremely nervous about taking it at first. I am allergic to sulfa. I am also allergic to ceftin. However, as I sit there with my epi pen at six in the morning scared to death. I had no reaction. This medicine may have saved my life. Even though, they removed the infected nerve in my tooth. I still had traces of bacteria and a severe sinus infection.I noticed no major side effects with this medicine other than an upset stomach. Drink with plenty of water and eat a heavy breakfast or meal. The medicine made me hungry. It also made me very hyper but productive. I was able to get housework done because I was not in pain. I worked better with my co-workers. This tooth/sinus infection was really bad - a bad tooth infection can take you out of this world.I took 875mg twice a day for two weeks. Hope this helps!",HollyTurkovich
3,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 18, 2020",3,"Went to Urgent Care for Sinus Infection.  Dr. gave me Amoxicillin to take for a week. 6 PILLS A DAY! 2-500mg, 3x per day.I questioned the Dr. if this was the best regimen and she said that is what ""they"" are recommending.  The medicine barely worked.  42 pills in one week and it barely did a thing.  My head still felt like it weighed 100lbs and still had terrible sinus pain, exhausted, achy and miserable.  Went to ENT and he gave me Levaquin.  Started working right away.  So depressed I had to take 42 pills for no reason.  Amoxicillin causes a lot of Vaginal ""unrest"".  Not worth it AT ALL!!  Giving it 2 stars in case it did something that I didn't realize but I don't think so.",blue-sky
4,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 12, 2019",8,I've taken amoxicillin with clavulanic acid twice before and had awful vomiting and diarrhea. My dr prescribed it recently without clav (500 mg) to see if that was causing GI problems. Nope. It was the amoxicillin. I took 1 pill with food and water at 6 pm and was violently vomiting at 9:45 for about an hour. I was vomiting so much that my blood pressure dropped so low (83 over something) I almost passed out. Then I couldn't breath (either from the pill or anxiety about almost passing out). Then the burning stomach cramps and diarrhea started which was coming out like a fire hose. I ended up calling 911 because I was so sick. Had to give me benadryl and an IV drip. I will never take this stuff again. I obviously can't handle a single pill of it!,lola
5,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 11, 2019",3,Diarrhea is so bad. Yeast infections every time I've ever used it. My old doctor wouldn't even prescribe it because of the known side effects.,Oceangirl
6,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2018",5,"Used this drug for a minor sinus infection and ended up with an incurable skin fungal infection that I have been dealing with for 5 years now, plus numerous food intolerances.  Please think twice before taking this medication unless absolutely necessary. I used to be healthy with beautiful skin and could eat what I wanted.  Wish I could go back and not have taken the medication.",BeeBee
7,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2018",7,"I was given this for sinus, started taking on a Friday night at 875mg for 2 times a day. Well on Monday my left eye got blurry, along with my top lip swelling plus under my chin swollen up and made my issue worse. Went to doctor on Tuesday and she said I had a allergic reaction to the meds. She changed it to Prednisone along with a shot in the hip and my symptoms got better within hours. My eye is still blurry but not as bad but I'll give that a few days.",FixitJesus

9,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 8, 2017",6,"Amoxicillin loosens the dried mucus for me, along with a lot of water, but doesn't eradicate the infection.  The best antibiotic for me is cefdinr",fances
10,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 9, 2016",12,I have taken this medication many times for sinusitis along with concurrent ear infections (otitis media). It has always cleared up my infection. The only drawback is that I am always prescribed the 875 mg pill and those pills are HUGE!,AveMaria02
11,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,1.0,,"April 25, 2016",6,"After 7 days on amoxicillen and worsening pain in maxillary sinus, went to ER. Was given  choice of 10 days augmentin or zpak. Chose zpak. 5 days, I've already been sick 4 weeks. Wanted faster relief.",675ttt

13,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2015",15,"Had to take this 3 times a day for 21 days. Only used it for 3 days. Had side effects.. Stomach upset, intestinal upset, headache and felt anxious.. I've used it before years ago with no problems but this times it's a no go.. I guess our systems change as the years go on..",Dreamspirit
14,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,10.0,,"December 29, 2014",30,"I take amoxicillin everytime I have a sinus infection. It clears it up  unbelievably fast. I usually start feeling a little better within a couple of hours.  I also never get a vaginal yeast infection that a lot of antibiotics can cause. No other weird side effects for me, other than it might change your bowel pattern a little. No diarrhea though.",jeanniebug
15,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,2.0,,"August 6, 2011",27,"Amoxil (amoxicillin):I'd taken Amoxil before and had no reaction to it, but apparently you can develop an allergic reaction to this medicine. The doctor prescribed this along with a new allergy medicine so it took about three days before the allergy medicine couldn't fight off the reaction that I (up until that point) didn't realize I was having to Amoxil.  It started with swollen spots in the back of my throat before I went to bed.  My roommates mother is a nurse and told me to take extra Benadryl which is probably what saved me because by 4am I had to go to the emergency room because my throat was swelling closed and I only had a small airway left.  The good thing was that this reaction took place over several hours and could EASILY be treated.",Anonymous
16,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,5.0,,"January 22, 2010",18,"While it began to work quickly, after 4 doses, I spent the night vomiting every couple of hours and the next day recovering from the side effects.  Getting a prescription for something else with fingers crossed that I don't have the same effects.",Anonymous

19,Amoxicillin,Sinusitis,10.0,,"June 4, 2009",27,"I had previously been on a 10-day cycle of Cefuroxime to battle an annoying nasal infection with post-nasal drip. The Cefuroxime didn't really work and the infection came back. This time a different doctor at the clinic prescribed amoxicillin and on the second day, it's gone. Just like that.",Hilander
