0,Levaquin,Sinusitis,10.0,,"September 24, 2021",0,"41/F I had a serious sinus infection for over a year after having Covid — I took so many antibiotics that didn’t help at all — augmentin, doxycycline, amoxicillin, and a few others. Then they took several cultures that showed the bacteria citrobacter k. present, which is resistant to most antibiotics. I was put on Cipro for 20 days, then again for 14 days. Didn’t help much. The only other option for oral / non-IV antibiotics for this bacteria was Levaquin. I’m on Day 5 of 14 and already seeing a huge improvement, unlike any other antibiotic used. I’m hopeful it will eventually go away completely. I haven’t noticed any side effects, I have a physical job and I’m physically active and I haven’t noticed any issues with tendons etc. When I asked about the side effects some people get, namely the issues with tendons and joints, my physician said that is more likely if you’re overweight or over 60.",Chicagoland79
1,Levaquin,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 14, 2020",10,I was given Levaquin for Sinus. I am now disabled with complete body wide nerve damage.

It always works twice as fast and twice as well as the other antibiotics that are usually prescribed. One of many non working antibiotics led my Dad to an ICU visit, in 24 hours he was a different person after being so sick. Levaquin can quickly turn things around.",Aggies95
3,Levaquin,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2020",25,"500MG x 1 a day. I took one pill. I was warned about the black box by my doctor but, I don't even know if that matters at this point. I experienced extreme tendon, joint and ligament swelling for over 48 hours. That was nothing tho, compared to the nerve pain in my arms and extreme weakness. Three days later since taking just one and the weakness/electric shocks are now in my legs too. I can't even hold a glass or balance myself properly while walking. Just typing is difficult. My doctor basically told me ""This could get better, this could get worse or it could just never change. There's no treatment and people improve or don't at different rates from anywhere to weeks to months to years."" TL;DR: Don't take Levaquin, even if you have handled Cipro in the past. It's not worth it, unless it's an emergency and life threatening infection. I now have to just hope I improve.",Sel

I am allergic to most antibiotics except for the tetracyclines and quinolones / fluoroquinolones.  I've had a sinus infection for 2 1/2 weeks now and was on a round of doxycycline 100mg 2x/day for 10 days, which did absolutely nothing.  Now I am on Levaquin 500mg 1x/day for 10 days.  On day 5 and the only side effects are insomnia, slight abdominal pain and nausea. I will take that over the inability to breathe, post nasal drip and a cough any day because I know it's temporary.

8,Levaquin,Sinusitis,9.0,,"January 22, 2019",9,"Levaquin is the ONLY antibiotic that gets rid of my 4x/year sinus infections. I switched doctors in November, and came down with an infection just after making my first appointment. I agreed to try a different antibiotic—Cefuroxine— because I HAVE experienced tendon injury after taking Levaquin (I was sprinting a couple months later and not aware of the warnings). I sort of got over the November sinusitis and then came down with another in January. I honestly don't think the first one ever went away, leading to the second flare-up. I again agreed to try a different antibiotic, Doxycycline (I’m still babying those tendons from 3 years ago, so why not avoid the Levaquin, right?). Was on the Doxy 10 days, and, now, three days after finishing, I am no better. I’m calling my doc’s office and insisting on the Levaquin tomorrow. I just won’t be doing sprints.",Lizru

Now on day 5 since I stopped the medicine, though I am not experiencing serious pains, I am really struggling getting, hot flushes & tingling in the lower leg areas & suffering to walk properly due to stiff Achilles tendons.

14,Levaquin,Sinusitis,10.0,,"February 10, 2018",27,So many complaints about this I find comical. I just used this medication for sinus infection last week. Used it numerous times before. I still workout on it no issues. You people crying that now you have tendon pain years later have got it bad. Went snowboarding yesterday with kids on my last dose. Must have been a miracle because even though yeah I had diarrhea and didn’t have as much energy I still had a great time. Going to CrossFit after this response. To sum it up I never had issues with this medication.  People’s posts are 100%  different from my experience.,Shawn999

All on left-side.  Went to my PCP, who said my sinuses were almost completely closed.  I did not have any pain around eyes/nose at this point.  Put on Levaquin.  The pain has gotten worse!!  Has not helped me with my sinus infection.  In fact, I'm on day 6, and not only do I have pain in my teeth, ears, and throat still, but now it's traveled throughout my entire head!
