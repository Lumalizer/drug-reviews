0,Zithromax,Sinusitis,10,,"April 2, 2021",30,"I am prone to sinus infections, and usually get them with seasonal changes. Sometimes they come with ear stuffiness, and usually with a fever, sore throat, and migraines. The exhaustion is the worst! With 2 small children, this time around, I had to get back on my feet quickly as there are no sick days. Well ZPACK works within hours, even on the pain of the sinus pressure! This has gotten me back to normal more times in my 34 years than I can count. I am extremely thankful for it because I have very few alternatives, being severely allergic to penicillin.",Lianna
1,Zithromax,Sinusitis,9,,"April 26, 2017",11,I am on day 3 of this I felt like death on day one could barely stand up clogged up extremely sore throat ... day 2 still clogged up but not as much and throat starting to feel better I'm surprised! Say 3 today still some mucus this morning dnd a bit of sore throat but way way better then day 1!,Emy888816ga
2,Zithromax,Sinusitis,10,,"January 20, 2017",30,"I was prescribed a five day round with the Z-pak after developing a severe flu-like upper respiratory infection with stuffed and painful sinuses plus aches, sore throat, diarrhea, muscle pain, nausea, and more. I had a Rituxan infusion, and all of this started the next day (common side effects or adverse events). I have rheumatoid arthritis, and my immunosystem is screwed to begin with and the Rituxan infusions temporarily make it worse. So I picked up a bug; bam!Long story, short ending. The Z-pak began working almost immediately, and two hours after my second pill of 250 mg (first was 500) I don't feel sick. My sinuses are still a bit clogged but that's livable. I'm impressed.",Jmnknight
3,Zithromax,Sinusitis,8,,"December 28, 2016",23,"I'm 35 and have had sinus infections as long as I can remember. Prior to my allergy shots I was getting them 3-4x a year. Z-PAC is my favorite and it cures it quickly. Once in a blueMoon I'll need another round though. But lately my doctors have said the bacteria has been resistant to it and I've used another medication and though it works it takes so much longer. I'm happy to say that I'm Told The bacteria this year isn't supposed to be as resistant to it.  For all the ladies, you may want to ask for yeast infection meds before you leave the doctors office. For me It never fails.",Hezbutt
4,Zithromax,Sinusitis,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 31, 2016",54,"Was told by a doctor who specialized in respiratory infections, because his main patients were miners, that I would suffer with chronic sinus infections the rest of my life and that a z-pak would work but to really wipe it out, I should use ceftin.  So if z-pak does not work for anyone try the ceftin.  I get z-pak normally because I can tolerate the azithromycin. A little stomach upset on the day after all meds are taken (6th day), but other than that, good results...usually takes 48 hours for me to feel better since I am older and have a weakened immune system, but on that third day, much much better.",Lucille 60
5,Zithromax,Sinusitis,10,,"December 26, 2015",58,After trying other antibiotics.This was the only one that worked.The Doctor tried to tell me it would not work for Sinusitis.It is the only antibiotic that takes it away for me.,Pashon
6,Zithromax,Sinusitis,10,,"December 7, 2015",81,"It's a life saver for me.  Chronic sinus problem that occurs twice a year.  Slight stomach issues after initial dose.  Knocks out brain fog.  Had the best night sleep in months.  Always take with food, and you will have no issues.  Made me feel 90% better 24 hours after initial dosage.  Use with Flonase to open passages to help get it all.  Only thing that works for my sinus problems.",Pauly D.
7,Zithromax,Sinusitis,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 15, 2015",15,"This medication did help my issue but it has now caused me to bruise so easy. I can barely scratch my leg and a few minutes later, my leg looks like I had been hit. They are not the painful but they or tender.",Sassy1510
8,Zithromax,Sinusitis,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 13, 2015",20,"The day one two pills does tend to wipe out the bacteria in my gut.  After having stomach issues on the first night of the first time, I do take a probiotic and one immodium at night.  First time I took this it wiped the infection in 48 hours. Second time 11 months later it did not work quite so well. Infection greatly decreased but did come back 5 days later.  I think part of the problem was that I still had a virus and mold allergy problems from rain as well as an infection so had trouble eliminating congestion.  I took a 5 day dosage and did have symptoms reoccur in a week. I do think it would have worked better if I had not had these additional issues related to a virus and allergies.",EricfromNC
9,Zithromax,Sinusitis,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 11, 2014",69,"I have had chronic sinusitis for the better part of 10 years now off and on. It really gets bad as spring changes over to summer as well as summer over to fall. I have taken several different antibiotics over the years and the sinusitis keeps coming back stronger the next year. So I just started the 7 day ZPak yesterday for the first time and just took the second days dosage. Much like most of the other reviews on this site, I am experiencing some minor diarrhea as well as flatulence. Which, in my opinion, can be a deadly combination for a new pair of white boxer briefs!  I have not noticed any other side effect as of yet but again I am only on the second day. I will tell you that I am feeling much livelier right now and gained motivation",Chronic Sinusitis
10,Zithromax,Sinusitis,1,,"August 6, 2014",83,"Took away my ear infection but gave me. Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, heart palpitations, anxiety, shortness of breath, diarrhea, dizziness, etc... So not worth it. I was less sick before starting this medicine.",Steph3
11,Zithromax,Sinusitis,10,,"February 6, 2014",104,Many many sinus infections over the years.  This knocks it out in 3 days compared to 10.,jenbro
12,Zithromax,Sinusitis,2,,"March 5, 2013",53,"I am one of the few that have not had a good experience.  High anxiety because my heart won't slow down, bad headache, little nausea, and loose stool. I'm going tomorrow to get different antibiotics.",andreamarie2012
13,Zithromax,Sinusitis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 13, 2012",100,"After suffering from a cold for 8 days, I woke up with extreme pressure in my sinuses and couldn't hear due to my ears being clogged.  I was prescribed  the 3 day Zithromax and after one day felt sooo much better.  The pressure went away and I had a slightly runny nose. One the second day I could breathe without using decongestants.  I haven't had any side effects, but maybe a slight pang in my stomache when taking (I usually eat something right after taking).  I'm usually resistant to going to the dr. but very glad I did this time.",Anonymous
14,Zithromax,Sinusitis,10,,"September 9, 2011",33,"I have had this sinus infection for 5 days. Went to the doctors yesterday the doctor prescribed me Zithromax. The side effects with me are stomach cramps, diarrhea, bloody nose and dizziness. But it seems to be working so far. Lets hope that by time the bottle is finished I feel like myself again.",Anonymous
15,Zithromax,Sinusitis,1,,"August 12, 2011",39,"Z-Pak was given to me during a walk-in-care visit. 7 days after starting, my condition has not improved. I experienced several side effects, including nausea, diarrhea, fever, sweating, and more. The worst of all is the loss of appetite caused by the medication. I have only had about 2 days worth of meals in the last five and still cannot stomach a full meal.",Anonymous
16,Zithromax,Sinusitis,9,,"April 7, 2010",85,"I've used Zithromax 6-Paks for years to treat chronic sinus infections. They always work and have virtually no side effects for me. I have noticed that I need to take the treatment twice for a persistent sinus infection. Usually, one treatment does it. Azithromycin is the ONLY antibiotic that does NOT give me terrible side effects such as stomach aches, cramps, headaches, dizziness, ""brain fog"".",Spidero
17,Zithromax,Sinusitis,8,,"January 10, 2010",41,"I used this for every infection, now the sad part is I am resistant. I used the whole 5 day dose, felt a lot better, then the infection came back a week later.",.......
18,Zithromax,Sinusitis,10,,"November 19, 2009",78,"I personally believe The Z-Pak should be the #1 Drug Prescribed on the Market if you need to maintain your Health FAST & be yourself again. I seem to be prone to Strep Throat, Severe Sinustitis & Resp. Infections in the Fall & Winter. A couple of years ago I was 'Due to have Surgery in 6 Days' and was told ""if I was sick I would have to Postpone it"". Well after waiting a month for this Surgery, planning a Home & Dog Sitter & Time off from work 'working it in with everyone else's Schedules, to me it was Imperative I be well enough 4 all to go as planned'. ""5 day Z-Pac was prescribed"". It is a no nonsense drug and I can not think of a single side effect. I was well enough for surgery to go on as planned. ",Anonymous
19,Zithromax,Sinusitis,8,,"November 5, 2009",27,"I get sinusitis several times a year. The old-fashioned 5-day Z-packs used to work really well for me. They still do ""knock down"" the worst of it (I carry a filled prescription from my doctor when I'm traveling on business) ... but in the past several years I've noticed that sometimes the sinusitis will rebound in a couple of weeks and I end up having to take a different type of antibiotic.Unfortunately, those secondary antibiotics tend to get to me -- queasy stomach, the ""taste"" of the medicine even hours later. None of that with Zithromax. The only time I had a bad experience with Zithromax side effects was the three-day pack.",sinusitis sufferer

21,Zithromax,Sinusitis,5,,"August 27, 2009",45,"I was prescribed Zithromax for an upper respiratory infection and I did not have such a good experience. The first day I had really bad diarrhea. I couldn't even leave the house. The 2nd day I was overwhelmed with nausea. I took the pill with food and still felt sick to my stomach the entire day and night. Today I have decided the terrible side effects are not worth it, and I'm not going to take the rest of my prescription.",Anonymous

25,Zithromax,Sinusitis,9,,"January 19, 2009",25,After years of suffering a one nostril clog. I was recently prescribed a 5 day 250MG dosage of Zithromax. I had zero side effects and it although it didn't totally clear my sinus infection it cleared it enough for me to know it was absolutely effective and on the right path.I can now get lengthy periods of use out of my other nostril and that's better than I've had in 10 years.,Clemet
