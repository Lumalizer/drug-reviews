I have had many sinus infections over the years that have responded well to other antibiotics. I am on my 5th day of ceftin, twice a day, and I still feel like rubbish. I no longer have a fever but the sinus pressure and congestion is still present. It might just be me but I usually feel relief from other antibiotics after 2 days. I am going to finish my 10 day supply then call my doctor.",Lola

2,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,8.0,,"March 24, 2021",2,"I was afraid to take this based on reviews. Took it anyway. No issues first 3 days besides some minor stomach cramps. Woke up on day 4 in a stinky night sweat, thought that was very strange (I never usually have a body odor, not even when I sweat) thought maybe I was sweating some kind of infection out. Bizarre. Noticed on night 4 that I was able to take in a deep breath again for the first time in months! Woke up on day 5 with semi-diarrhea. 5 more days to go. We'll see. I'll update this review when I finish the course. I feared taking this because of the stomach effects as I just had two precancerous polyps removed from my colon 1mo ago, but so far it's been totally tolerable. I haven't taken it with probiotics or yogurt or bananas, just water. I did notice the nasty taste when swallowing the pill on the 4th night for the first time since starting the med, so the bad taste thing might be progressive for some bc I didn't notice it until day 4. I've been taking it at 9am and bedtime.",Cc

9,Cefuroxime,Sinusitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 24, 2019",30,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):I was given Ceftin by my regular doctor for a sinus infection . 500 mg , 2 times a day . It always clears my infection , usually notice feeling better after day 3 . After awhile , it didn’t work anymore and my sinusitis became chronic . Levaquin was then the only thing that worked . Now Levaquin is dangerous . So I thought maybe , after 7 years of no Ceftin , maybe it would work again . Thankfully , it works again . I have no side effects , take with food . It is really the BEST antibiotic I’ve ever taken . I can’t take augmentin or sulfa , so I’m very glad that there is Ceftin ! It’s a big pill .

Every time I have taken it, I have only been able to endure a few days before the incredibly harsh nature of this medicine on my stomach forces a doctor to stop the use.  This week I was prescribed it again and 4 hours into the VERY FIRST PILL of my VERY FIRST DOSE, I began to feel terrible stabbing abdominal pain and then began over 24 hours of awful diarrrhea and vomiting.  My body felt like it was going through a war.  Now not only was I still battling through sinusitis, but due to taking this Ceftin I added symptoms of being in the throes of a stomach virus.  I went to the doctor 12 hours into this episode whereby he told me NEVER TAKE THIS MEDICINE AGAIN....it clearly is having awful reactions with your body.  This has really set me back now and thanks to the havoc it wrecked on my insides now I can’t take any meds orally for a bit until we can stabilize my stomach.",Jersey

Being a person that has lived with nasty sinus infections most of my life, I never take the same antibotic twice in one year. However, Ceftin is at the top of my list. It cures the infection. Make sure you take a ten day (1000mg daily) course if you have a bad infection. It does make you feel bad - it is hard on your stomach so you must take it with food. Yoghurt or Activa is a must and also make sure you have a bunch of bananas on hand. Good luck.",richard4ga
