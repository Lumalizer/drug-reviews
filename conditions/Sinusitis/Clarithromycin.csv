0,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 7, 2022",0,"Taken 2 Clarithromycin 500mg a day for 5 days, bit of bowel movement throughout the following second day, but not too bad, one evening of constant cramp like pain, but okay the next day. It does leave like a horrible bitter taste in your mouth, that didn't start until the fourth day, cleared  my sinuses pretty well & my very bad headache, has started to clear, and  as the high pitched noise in my ears has gone. I found them to be a little big, easy enough to swallow & found it better to have one in the morning & early evening. I found it better to take them before & an hour or so after food.",Tigger
1,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 28, 2021",0,"A few hours after taking the first tablet there was a bitter taste in my mouth which became increasingly worse as the day progressed, a similar taste to hand sanitizer or nail polish remover (if you’ve ever accidentally licked your fingers after,) almost unbearably bitter.It really hits the back of your throat inevitably making you feel quiet nauseous in the end, as if you have been drinking something that’s not good for you, slight stomach cramps until in finally starts to ease a few hours before the next dose.I found chewing minty gum during the day helped, drinking wine in the evening took the taste away and made me sleepy enough when the next dose kicked in so as I could sleep through the horrible taste!",Ruth
2,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 20, 2021",1,"When taking clarithromycin for the first time, all I can say it has been the best medication that has helped my sinuses straight away when taking just one tablet, normally it would take 2-3 days before I would feel a little better with other medication but clarithromycin helped me get much. I got better sleep within the first night, however all I can say is occasionally I was woken up with the metallic taste in my mouth and the feeling of nausea, but I can deal a lot better with those symptoms for 7 days then to have sleepless nights from sinusitis",Anomynos
3,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 6, 2021",1,"I was prescribed clarithromycin  500mg every 12hrs (twice daily) for 10 days by my ENT consultant after I used  Doxy for 7 days without relief for my bacterial infection. I started feeling better after the third dose and didn't have any major side effect. I had yogurt before and after taking the medication.  By day four I was hit by all the side effects in the book. I started going to the toilet twice a day (bowel movement). My normal  routine is once. I experienced headache, body and muscle ache, fatigue, metallic taste in the mouth and generally feeling unwell. By the time I completed my 10 days almost all my sinusitis symptoms where gone. I still experienced the full blown side effects of this medication headache, body and muscle ache, fatigue, metallic taste in the mouth and generally feeling unwell for 5 days after completing the dose. Did it clear my infection YES. Will I use this again NO. It is way too strong for me.",TemiT
4,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 3, 2021",0,"Started a course of clarythromycin yesterday for a recurring scalp psoriasis, I'd taken it before as it was the only thing that helped in the end as all the medicated shampoos antihistamines & creams weren't really getting to the root of the bacterial infection in my skin. I had the same side effects as I did the first time I took it mostly a persistent metallic taste on my mouth alleviated somewhat by hard sweets/lucozade type drinks; also a spaciousness fogginess feeling that makes rational thinking & conversation somewhat difficult; I have scoliosis anyway so am on strong codeine for the pain but this medicine seems to worsen the lower back pain but as much psoriasis is improving day by day & remembering how it worked before I will persist until the end of the course also make sure you take the medicine with or after food or the nausea kicks in very quickly.",Lady J
5,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 15, 2021",0,The side effect of bitter taste in my mouth is awful but not as bad as the sinus pain I had. It took 4 days of taking the medication for it to really work and the painful face to go but it definitely eased after 2 days. I can tolerate the weird taste because that pain was awful. I'm just glad I'm not the only one who has experienced it as I thought I was going crazy.,Moo review

7,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 27, 2021",0,"I was prescribed a 7 day course of 500mg (2 a day) of clarithromycin for a particularly bad dose of sinusitis and an ear infection.I wish I had read the reviews before I started taking it as I will never take it again.First couple of days everything was OK, then the anxiety started coupled with a racing heart and palpitations. Got so bad I had to go to the A&E to get checked out. I then had the worst acid reflux I have ever experienced I've been in so much pain. It has now been 5 days since I stopped taking them. Yesterday was the first day I didn't have any palpitations and after getting some omeprazole from the chemist the acid reflux is starting to lift slightly.To be honest my ear infection would have been preferable to what I've been through the past few days.Avoid at all costs!!",Katieham

11,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 29, 2020",19,I suffer from chronic sinusitis with around 4 flare ups if acute each year. My sinuses are so painful that a metallic taste from clarithromycin is worth having. I am on the second day of this course clarithromycin 500mg twice a day. I can already feel some improvement and I have 12 days to go.  I have a lot of underlying health issues including cancer and side effects are a given for strong medication. I usually take Doxycycline from which I have far worse stomach symptoms. I think this drug is great for clearing up severe infections. I have taken both with and without food. The only thing I religiously do is drink a full glass of water with them.,Dee
12,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 21, 2020",16,"I got this antibiotic what would have been 3 days ago today. The first day I had a complete break down and cried my eyes out. I was extremely emotional and depressed feeling hopeless and felt like I was losing my mind. I couldn’t stop crying. I have a metallic taste in my mouth and have had headaches every day. Last night I was all of a sudden having excruciating stomach cramps I couldn’t stand or sit or lay down the pain was unbearable. I considered calling 911 because the pain was so bad but settled for 811 health link instead. I thought I was dying. It took hot pads and pain killers to even be able to lay down. Today I am stuck on the couch (husbands orders) and after last night my stomach is still very tender and cramping but nothing compared to how it was. I would suggest never taking this medication. It was an absolute nightmare and I will NEVER take this again, it shouldn’t even be prescribed to people. It is absolute poison.",Jodie
13,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 10, 2020",4,"I’m currently on day 6 of this medication and I haven’t noticed any improvement whatsoever. When the medication wasn’t working and I started getting pain in my top rear molars I made an appointment with my dentist. They checked everything yesterday and told me there’s no tooth infection (even though I feel pressure in my teeth)... I don’t know why I still have sore cheek bones, pressure around my nose and eye, swollen lymph nodes.. and this awful medication isn’t helping at all. It’s super discouraging. I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I’m going to finish the full course (4days left). The one thing I did find odd is I haven’t experienced this gross metal taste everyone else is talking about? I’ve had a whole other slew of TERRIBLE side effects that have made me call a nurse at 2am though...",Kiki

15,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 18, 2020",12,This clarithromycin gave me a very poor experience. I am 3/4 the way through taking the course and I threw it in the trash. If you have anxiety do NOT take this drug. I have never had worse insomnia from an antibiotic. All day I feel tired and then at night I am sleepless. In addition to this the nausea makes it very difficult to eat. I am in my mid 20s and never thought something as simple as an antibiotic could do this. As far as treating the sinus infection it went away but I am still experiencing a runny nose,Mikey

Took it until the 4 day of the 10 days course before I had to call doc with s.o.s. The metallic taste & little bit of stomach upset were okay but by night 4 I had the headache of death, and woke up every morning a little shaky with a headache. Awful. When the cure is worse than the disease. Was represcribed Cefuroxime Axetil so we’ll see if this can kick whatever it is making me bleh without killing me in the process.",Jro

19,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2019",39,"Have had sinus infections for over twenty years and although two operations have helped they can still recur  and are very nasty. Usually along with the sinus pain, I lose my voice with nasal drip and my breathing is affected with accompanying chest pain. Clarithromycin  was recommended by my consultant years ago and although my GP was reluctant he did agree to write the prescription when needed and has continued to do so.This drug is amazing for me. Literally within a few hours I can feel the pressure lifting from my sinuses, my voice starts to return and the weight lifts from my chest and I can breath properly again. Within a few days I am  back to normal.I ALWAYS take the tablet with food as per the instructions. If you don't you can get into all sorts of trouble as listed by others here. I have worried that I may become resistant to it as I probably take it twice a year but if anything it seems to be more effective for me as I get older. Not sure why.",Sinus sufferer

Before I took it, I was reading reviews of how awful this drug was and it totally freaked me out.  The side effects are not ideal but you'll survive. I've always found clarithromycin to be super effective and my sinus issues usually improve in two days.  The metallic taste is pretty bad, I'll admit that.  Sleeping is difficult but I take mine with some milk before I go to bed and it keeps the stomachaches at bay.",Daphne
22,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,7.0,,"September 13, 2019",19,"The doctor  prescribed  clarithromycin for a sinus infection.  I was really concerned after reading the reviews. My experience was positive. I only took the tablet with food, the nausea sensation only when my belly was empty; I had the metal taste in my mouth but sucking a lollie that quickly went away. I was very fatigued on this medication and my knees ached. It was hard to concentrate as well. The medication itself was a 7 day course and it took the full 7 days to clear my sinus infection where my tonsillitis etc went after day 1. I found breathing eucalyptus oil in my handkerchief dried my sinus really fast as this is a natural remedy to sooth I inflammation, I also massaged my sinus each night after a shower ( googled how to do this) and that really worked too. All in all the combination of the above worked abut it was really really slow to recover..don’t expect to feel great after a few days.",Shabby

Prescribed dosage 2 x 250mg a day before food. I was reluctant to take them as I react to most medications and cannot take Augmentin as it makes me pass out. Mind you I’ve only begun reacting to medications in the last 5 years. I felt so ill that I thought I have to take them hoping to feel better! Well only 3 days in and I feel worse! Will never take them again. Brain fog, tinnitus, severe fatigue, muscle aches, dizziness. Feel like sleeping all day and insomnia all night.  I also feel like my insides have been poisoned. Obviously every person reacts differently and not everyone will be affected in this way. Though for me this medication is pure poison.",Marge

26,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 19, 2019",14,"I was instructed to take this clarithromycin antibiotic for 10 days for a suspected sinus infection. The joke is that my doctor didn't do any testing to make sure that I had a bacterial sinus infection - it could've been viral or fungal, but I was just handed these drugs & sent on my way.I got all the usual side effects, upset stomach, the worst bloating ever and gas all day long. I took them with food but it still affected me. The bitter taste in my mouth was disgusting but tolerable. By day 5 heartburn struck & I felt very unstable mentally & physically. I began to get oral thrush caused by these tablets and this is when I gave up. I couldn't push myself to take anymore & now I have to take more medicine to clear the thrush. I can't even give the tablets any credit for clearing my infection because I may not have needed them to begin with.",Cali

The horrible metallic taste is normal with this med. Sucking on lemon drops or other hard candies can help. This med will cause stomach upset and cramps etc Unless you eat lots of yogurt- any kind and even the sweet not so good for you yummy tasting kind will work too. So you need to take it with the yogurt, you will need to eat a full meal then take the meds. This really will help keep stomach issues at bay as best as possible.

The 'mycin' family antibiotics work really well for me, whereas sulfas I have an allergic response to and amoxicillin only gives me yeast infections..usually 500 mg every 12, but I don't need it for long...closer to 5 days than 10..I notice side effects when I don't really need it: bad taste in mouth, stomach upset, the trots, nausea.I find this drug works amazing well for me.Although I'm usually advised to take the whole amount, my body simply can't handle it, and lets me know when its time to stop!When its working, none of those side effects are present- just healing.Different antibiotics work differently for different peoples systems..but if erythromycin works for you, this is like its stronger big brother.I recommend.",Lee
30,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 14, 2019",7,"I've never had any issues with my sinuses thus far in my life. I developed cold like symptoms in mid March and thought it would just go away with time. Well no such luck. I thought I had developed allergies out of no where so I started taking Claritin D with Mucinex. The Claritin D offered no relief so I finally made an appointment with Otolaryngologist. He prescribed clarithromycin for 10 days, once in the morning and once at night. After a few days, all my symptoms went away. I could finally breathe out my nose and the sinus pressure vanished. The only thing is by the middle of the day, I could feel the pressure coming back. I also missed a dose one morning and by the end of the day all the symptom came right back. There is also a bitterness to the pill, so I usually eat it with food. I am only on my first round but I hope the second round gets rid of it. If not, my doctor said I would have to get a CT scan.",Philip
31,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 10, 2019",14,"I have a LOT of allergies to antibiotics so clarithromycin  is one of two that I can take, that being said, it works better than the Z-Pak that I am normally prescribed for sinus infections. I unfortunately get them every few months. Last time I had a sinus infection I took the Z-Pak and by the end of the course I was still really sick so my doctor prescribed me Clarithromycin. It is more effective but the side effects for me are pretty bad. It makes my stomach hurt pretty badly despite trying to eat before taking it, makes me feel dizzy, and leaves a gross metallic taste in my mouth. Sometimes it makes me feel kind of panicky but it normally goes away pretty quickly. It has also been giving me some pretty terrifying dreams since I started it. Overall I would rather deal with the unpleasant side effects than deal with a sinus infection so I would definitely say it's effective.",Gabby

I used to have those issues on antiobiotics, but then I learned that taking a very strong probiotic (I take the refrigerated ones from Jarro) and a feminine probiotic with lactobaccilus eliminates or at least greatly reduces those issues. I strongly recommend taking both whenever you take antiobiotics.For this one, I agree that you definitely need to take it with a reasonable amount of food. The metallic taste comes and goes but is generally tolerable. I do feel loopy, but I am guessing that has more to do with how sick I am than anything else. Hope this helps.",erky

162,Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2012",19,"Multiple problems which a 7 day course of Erthymacin did not solve a month earlier and my condition worsened.  Lost my voice - throat felt like it was on fire and a nagging cough, have a dental abscess and the sinusitis was the worst problem - as it stopped me from being able to sleep through the night; constantly having to get up to clear my throat from the sinus drainage. The sinus drainage upset my tummy which had me vomiting at work.  I switched doctors and my new doctor said I was under-treated.  He gave me two shots in the butt (one was a steroid and the other one I think was for my allergies).  He prescribed the clarithromyacin  14days- after a few days I really noticed that my sinuses were much improved. Sore throat gone/sleeping!.",Xstat
