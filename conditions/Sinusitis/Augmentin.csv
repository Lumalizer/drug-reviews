2,Augmentin,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 5, 2021",0,"This is my experience with Augmentin. I have a history of severe anxiety and am generally sensitive to medications. I had a tooth extraction and bone graft but also ended up with ear and sinus pain. I was given Augmentin and figured I'd be fine. I took the first dose and was okay. The next morning I had very loose stool and a bit elevated heart rate. The second dose in the evening, I had a horrible panic attack to the point where I nearly passed out/went to the hospital. The next morning I took my dose and ended up with an awful panic attack again a few hours later. Thats when I called my doctor and was told to switch to Amoxicillin. Everyones body reacts different. Definitely keep track of your symptoms, drink a lot of water, and rest!",AnxietyQueen
3,Augmentin,Sinusitis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 20, 2021",0,I've taken this briefly before but don't remember having side effects like this time around. I wake up in the middle of the night with nausea. I've had stabbing headaches that are worse than my usual vertiginous migraines. My stomach is so bloated and just very upset all the time. My ears feel better but I started another allergy med at the same time so I don't know if it's due to that or this. I certainly wouldn't take this med unless you really need it. Can't wait to finish.,elfontheshelf

5,Augmentin,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 2, 2021",4,"Having new medication anxiety, a sensitive stomach, acid reflux, and an irrational fear of diarrhea and vomiting made me terrified of taking this medication after reading a lot of these reviews.But! The key here is food. Avoid anything that upsets your guts. Eat something right before taking the pill and eat a probiotics yogurt 2-3 hours after taking the pill. This will help with angry tummy & also help prevent yeast inflections caused by antibiotics, ladies. Don’t skip a meal and snack on crackers or the likes throughout the day. This med is bad if it is in an empty stomachs.Coming from someone who has taken lower dose amoxicillin only and gotten the runs every time, with sticking to a strict regimen of never letting the gut be empty and eating the yogurt 2 hours after taking the pill I’ve had no side effects and started feeling better on the 2nd day.

10,Augmentin,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2020",26,"Ok so I started with pneumonia and then it kinda came back as a sinus infection/ bronchitis (I have no idea). So they gave me this antibiotic for resistance issues. The first dose had my tummy rumbling, but I ate and took a probiotic! I had loose stools (and still have them) but I am slightly afraid of antibiotics just because they upset my stomach (previously the doxy for my lungs). But the probiotic helps SO MUCH! As long as you eat with it, and take a probiotic if you want to, then you should be fine. I really like the way it’s working!

I took my first dose I didn’t see any differences although I already had a fever and my heart rate was pretty high because I was fighting off an infection. My second dose kept me up all night long. My third dose made me sleepy and lethargic all yesterday. My fourth dose I wasn’t feeling better or worse but at one random point I checked my heart rate and it was 172 and my fiancé said that wasn’t right and some thing about the app that I use was wrong. I didn’t feel it.

Well guess what, another panic attack. Those were two of the most scariest experiences of my like. I couldn’t breath, I was trembling, chest pounding.

17,Augmentin,Sinusitis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 13, 2019",15,Prescribed augmentin for my sinusitis  at a dose of 2x a day for 10 days. Strength is 875/125.  I’m on day 5 and  I still have severe sinus pain and lots of bloody mucus discharge.  I had sinus polypectomy surgery 26 days ago and was cleared post op at day 19. On day 21 I had a full blown sinus infection that is also causing double vision.  Augmentin is doing absolutely nothing  and I do not feel any better. Usually there should be some relief or improvement by day 5.  I do not have any stomach trouble with it but I also make sure I’ve eaten a full meal before taking the meds and I am taking probiotics 1X per day.  Only side effect I’m having is I’m getting itchy hands feet for about 2 hours after taking Augmentin.  No rash just itchiness.,RobinsonCentral
18,Augmentin,Sinusitis,1.0,,"October 17, 2019",12,I took this for 4 days and now I’m seriously regretting it. I have serious diarrhea and the worst stomach pain and cramping imaginable. The severe diarrhea has meant 10-15 bowel movements per day. They have been pure liquid. I’m now on day 3 of the episodes and the diarrhea is now about a 1 to 1 mix of blood and stool. My appetite is shot and because of the pain and diarrhea I’m afraid of eating.The stomach pain is so severe that I’ve been bed ridden for the last 3 days. It’s so bothersome I’m not able to work from home while I’m off work.  It’s kept me awake every night where I get 2-3 hours of sleep and then the pain builds back up which requires a pill for pain that I supplement with Tylenol. I’m waiting to hear back on the lab results from the stool sample I provided. There is a chance that my stomach chemistry is damaged to the point that I may have contracted an illness called c diff which will require a 3rd type of antibiotic.,MJ

I do try to drink a lot of water while on it, but it is difficult when you feel so bloated. Nausea peaks around three hours after taking. I've never had any problems with medication before.

So yes I agree that this is not an antibiotic that should easily be first choice for everyone especially for people with sensitive stomach linings as myself. I already have it bad most of the time so don't need a medicine to make it worse. I will be calling the dentist tomorrow ASAP for a change.

Augmentin is the only thing that really clears it all up. It typically takes 2 to 3 doses before I start feeling like I am heading in the right direction. So within 24 to 48 hours I tend to be feeling better. Not like death - which if you haven't experienced a truly painful ear infection as an adult...well...you're lucky. It is awful. Augmentin does have some side effects, typically some stomach upset. Be sure take it with food and drink plenty of water.

Left ear was inflamed, took antibiotics and I guess it got better, I wouldn't know since there was no pain associated. January,  I developed weird ringing in my left, same ear. Ignored it. Now beginning of March, I started getting popping in that ear which spread to my right ear, basically the sensation of de-equalized pressure which is so irritating. Decided to go to the ER just 5 days ago, ER doc looked into my ears and said I had Ear effusion, then looked into my throat and sinuses and said they were inflamed. I was born with sinusitis so my turbinates are naturally enlarged, but I wasn't experiencing ANY signs of sinus infection (no weird / smelly mucus, or even terrible breathing from the weather change ) .

Day 5-6 I started having some nausea and congestion again upon waking but trips to the restroom stopped. Day 8, mild congestion but feel normal for once.

Unfortunately, I now have a ""sweet smell"" and still suffer from not being able to smell most of the time.

My doctor told me that this is common because an antibiotics job is to kill bacteria all whether good or bad....these include bacterial that naturally occur and are normal in the vaginal tract so my doctor usually prescribes something for a yeast infection. Other than that taken with food I did not have any side effects and feel much better..it's amazing how quickly it works. After being miserable for days, I'm very happy!",Works fast but as a female...

That was the only side effect I experienced though.  My guess is it's a pretty strong antibiotic and can affect everyone differently.",katt0103
113,Augmentin,Sinusitis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 22, 2014",86,"I was prescribed 500 mg twice a day Augmentin for a sinus infection. After the second dose I developed BAD stomach cramps, nausea and loose stools.  I continued the Augmentin for three more days but finally had to stop taking it due to the fact that it was completely destroying my stomach. It was working wonders on my sinus infection but the side effects were too much to bear. Worst of all, I'm still having cramps and loose stools even though I stopped taking the Augmentin two days ago. I hope the issues resolve themselves soon and won't require a trip to my gastroenerologist.  Augmentin may be fine for some people but it's definitely NOT for me!",sinus sufferer 55
114,Augmentin,Sinusitis,5.0,,"June 22, 2014",39,"I was prescribed Augmentin for a severe sinus infection. After about 3 days of taking it, I developed this weird skin rash first on the knuckles of both of my ring fingers, then noticed I had the same spots on my knees in the same place on both knees. This spread to both of my elbows also and creeped me out a little so I just stopped taking the medicine altogether. It did seem to take the sinus infection away, but I make sure to tell my doctors I'm allergic to it now just in case I have a more severe reaction in the future. This rash just looked like red dots, no burning or itching either... Pretty strange.",LindsayNicole

My head felt like a pressure cooker, I got an ear infection and the mucus drainage was terrible. I went to the doctor who diagnosed a sinus infection, he told me to get my dentist to X-ray my teeth, which revealed a big abscess at the root.I Had been put on amoxicillin 500mg x3 daily but it wasn't doing a great deal after four days so my GP replaced it with Augmentin)500/125 X 3 daily and after another four days minus a molar the mucus and swelling have improved massively. I can breathe again, plus the head pressure has subsided. Works well at the moment with 3 days of the 7 day course remaining. Hope it works for you.GOOD HEALTH TO YOU ALL.",Anonymous
116,Augmentin,Sinusitis,10.0,,"March 6, 2014",271,"Had a nasty sinus infection - my entire head seemed locked in a vacuum-grip of pressure, snot, and general awfulness. I felt dizzy, exhausted, irritated, and I think it even began to affect my thinking. I thought it was just a common cold but nope, the real deal. Augmentin 875, 2x/day for 10 days seems to have cleared it out, mostly. BUT HERE'S THE KEY, FOLKS --> Take a good probiotic every morning, about 3 or 4 hours before you take the first dose of Augmentin. Then, when it's time to take your Augmentin, take it with a LOT of food, and take it after the first or second bite of your meal. You'll get through it, and may it heal you as it seems to have healed me. No side effects for me, and I'm one sensitive, hypochondriacal mess normally!",HoosierAnna

My blood pressure seems to be up and down since taking the Augmentin and at times I have body aches and pains that make sleeping difficult.
