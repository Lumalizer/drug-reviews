0,Cipro,Sinusitis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 23, 2021",0,"I was prescribed the cipro tablets for 10 days for a resistant bacterial sinusitus infection. The medication did work in clearing the infection when the other 2 medications previous had failed. While on Cipro I experienced extreme nightmares, very disturbing dreams and sleep interruptions. I experienced continual bitter taste in my mouth. I experienced abdominal discomfort, IBS and diarrhea. I also experienced ringing in my ears/tinnitus at the time of taking Cipro and ever since, which is a time span from 2009 to 2021. I have permanent damage to my hearing and quality of life since taking this drug.",Canada1984
1,Cipro,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 25, 2020",7,"Took this for a sinus infection.  Did not clear it up, but about 4 weeks later I had neuropathy in my face which then spread down over my whole body.  Muscle spasms, arthritis,  vertigo, blurred vision, headaches, burning nerve pain, tendonitis, even my hair started falling out.  Had to do PT just to use my right leg again.  Went to multiple neurologists and drs. But they could not figure it out.  Almost a year later I was given cipro again and immediately felt like my whole body was on fire.  This was around the time they were having hearings at the FDA to add all the black box warnings, so my new doctor figured it out.   5 years later and I'm better, but still cant hike or do things I used to love, and still have nerve and tendon issues  Don't ever take Cipro!",Melissa

3,Cipro,Sinusitis,1.0,,"November 15, 2018",12,"First of all I am a Certified Pharmacy Tech, I have taken Cipro so many times in the past for ear infections, UTIs, sinusitis and whatever else. Well that ALL changed! I was taking it for my sinuses and an ear infection. Just about as soon as I swallowed the pill I started breaking out in a rash and welts all over my body. I looked like I had been chemical burn, not to mention the itching! I let the pharmacy manager look at me and she said you are highly allergic to Cipro. I had never had a reaction like that before in the past. I don’t know if they changed up the chemicals to it or what. To this day I can’t even count out Cipro if a patient has a script for it!! I will immediately break out in welts on my hands and start scratching if any of the powder gets on my skin. I can’t even touch the stock bottle it’s that bad.",NotForMe
4,Cipro,Sinusitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 1, 2018",7,"Pros: Noticed great improvement of my symptoms after only 24 hours and continued to get better each day. Cons: after the second dose started to have loose bowel and stomach pain. Also experienced nightmares and severe insomnia. By the third day, 6th dose, the side effects were much too severe to continue this antibiotic.",Alicia
5,Cipro,Sinusitis,1.0,,"October 15, 2016",27,"Took Cipro for a sinus infection.  Six days in I couldn't rotate my forearms. 3 years later, numerous doctors, two surgeries and my arms are practically useless.  FDA black box warning on it people. Google the drug. Do not ever take, fluoroquinolones are poison. They were originally developed to give to soldiers exposed to Anthrax.  And try to never take generic.  US Supreme Court says if you do you are not allowed to sue the original drug manufacturer OR the generic company you used. This drug ruined my life.",Mike from NY
