0,Cefdinir,Sinusitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 12, 2021",0,"Omnicef (cefdinir):This medicine made me feel worse than the original symptoms. I usually have a high tolerance for meds, don’t usually get dizzy or feel nauseous ever. But this medicine made me feel as I was suffering from being hung over. I would drive 8 hours later after taking the meds and would feel like I could black out whenever. I would randomly feel nauseous. The headaches were a constant theme. Now that I’ve read the comments I can attribute some of the diarrhea I had to it to. I went back to the dr and was prescribed Doxycycline so I’m on day 4 and I feel better but still suffer from a cough.",NotGoneLie

2,Cefdinir,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 11, 2021",0,"I’m a healthy 26 year old female. I finally went to my doctor when my cold wouldn’t go away. He said it had turned into a sinus infection and prescribed me Cefdinir. After 48 hours my sinus infection had almost cleared up but I started experiencing lightheadedness, severe anxiety, disorientation, stomach pain, and a fast heart beat to where I haven’t been able to do anything this past week. I’m on day 10 and just have 1 pill left but I would not recommend this to anyone. Literally makes me feel like I’m dying! Talked to my doctor and his response was it’s a strong medication with strong side effects. The mornings have been the worst. Side effects start about 40 minutes to an hour after taking and then subside after another few hours.",Teacher

4,Cefdinir,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 19, 2021",1,"I'm shocked at all of the bad reviews!  I am VERY, VERY sensitive to medications, and Cefdinir was GREAT for my sinusitis & upper respiratory infection!!  I took 300mg, twice a day, and always with 2 soda crackers and it worked WONDERFULLY!!  No side effects!  I also ate about 4oz of yogurt/daily, for a probiotic!  I almost always get nausea from any medications, but not with Cefdinir!  Don't be hesitant from the bad reviews...it really is a great antibiotic!!   Thank you~",Elle
5,Cefdinir,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 14, 2021",0,Worst experience I have ever had with a medication. I took only one pill and actually thought it was going to be the end of me. I had hallucinations throughout the night and my whole body hurt. After only 1 pill my gastrointestinal system was wrecked. I could barely eat anything for a month and lost so much weight. 6 months later and my stomach will never be the same.,Horrible reaction

8,Cefdinir,Sinusitis,7.0,,"March 15, 2021",4,This medicine did help clear my sinus infection but not nearly as fast as something like a a z-PAC or amoxicillin would have. And while it wasn’t as harsh on my stomach when it came to stomach aches and pains it absolutely tore me up when it came to using the restroom. It has been 4 days since I’ve finished 12 days of this and it’s still going. Overall I wouldn’t take this medicine again but it was effective at treating sinusitis.,Dylon

Some days it is so bad I can't leave my house for fear of an accident.  There are times I don't  make it to the bathroom.  I have been seeing a Gastrointestinal Specialist multiple times trying to get this resolved. They are still trying to figure out how to stop the episodes.  I have taken antibiotics in the past with no side-effects,  but this is the worst.   The negative side-effects from Cefdinir will make a big impact on your quality of life. It has effected my personal and professional life as well as my finances.

I fell to the ground and couldn’t get up anymore, I couldn’t breathe well and it felt like I was having a heart attack. After being taken to a hospital 2 hours passed and the nurse told me that my heartbeat is back to normal and that I can take the antibiotic again, and that it wasn’t the cause of my incident. The next morning I woke up fine, and when I took the second pill of the antibiotic I experienced the same thing again after 30 minutes exactly, the sudden pump of my heart and fast heartbeats with shortness of breaths and severe anxiety.

But I really wanted to knock the sore throat and sinus problem I had had for 3 weeks at that point. I had taken amoxicillin and felt better for a week, but it came right back, so I was put on Cefdinir. I took it it 2x a day for 10 days. I took it with a daily probiotic and Greek yogurt, and even Garlic Pills, and pepto  bismuth when necessary. The only issue I had is one day I decided to eat buffalo wings about 3 days in during a football game... regretted that the next day.

I'm a 33 yr old healthy female, so I don't have arthritis or anything. I'm not sure if this was causing tendon problems or what.

I should also add that I didn't notice any difference in my sinusitis,  so the medicine just gave me really bad diarrhea,  so not worth it to me.
