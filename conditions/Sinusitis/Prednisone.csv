1,Prednisone,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 3, 2021",1,"The problem was post nasal drainage along with all the sinus pressures.  My taste changed to the point if I even smelled meat cooking it would gag me. Eating it was even worse. It turns out my sinuses were completely blocked.. just full of infection. So it was surgery for me... but presurgery he had me take the 60 - 10 mg prednisone taper (6 days) day 2 my smell returned, I was overjoyed) a day later I could eat again.. even more joy. I'm off of it now, but the same drainage has returned and I can't eat meat.   Today I started on a 60 - 10 taper of pred.  its been 4 hours and I already can tell the difference.  I'm within a month of medicare, (which makes it pretty much free) so I'll go back to the ENT.  Hopefully I won't need another surgery and just occasional pred. no real side effects... ( except oh, wait..my wife  said when I was on 60mg  I needed a sign around my neck stating ""approach at your own risk, high prednisone at work"")  I guess I was a little testy but I couldnt tell.",Ronl
2,Prednisone,Sinusitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 1, 2020",14,Chronic asthmatic hay fever and sinusitis plus PTSD and extreme anxiety!! Usually get antibiotics and steroids for week or so and instantly within hours feel heaps better. Then when I stop the steroids and antibiotics my sinusitis flares up again and sometimes my sinuses make little blood streaks after blowing it. So I think steroids are fantastic just pity the effects don't stop it coming back I'm an allergy suffer badly. Any suggestions and opinions be great.,Pj
3,Prednisone,Sinusitis,10.0,,"November 30, 2020",20,"I've had chronic sinusitis with polyps since 1984, every operation you can think of - I had many years with better health, usually had an infection after every cold or flu which I could deal with, sometimes with the aid of basic amoxicillan.In recent years the infections have been getting worse, leading to inflammation which in turn stops the infection from draining which leads to more inflammation. I've had the same GP throughout all these years and it's only the last two that he has prescribed prednisone with amoxicillin. I take both for seven days, tapering the prednisone quickly.It feels like the miracle cure I've been looking for. I do notice side effects from the prednisone but these are manageable with good diet, water and rest. After only a couple of days, the discharge from the nose is quite large and highlights just how bad the infections must be and how much it must be taxing for the body's immune system to deal with.I can't recommend this course of treatment enough.",Chris

5,Prednisone,Sinusitis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2020",10,"Update: side effects of prednisone were weight gain (temporarily),  anxiety, insomnia, difficulty concentrating. These issues began to clear days after the end of treatment. My initial post was 10/10 on December 30th. The latter side effects are difficult and interrupt daily life the most depending on your daily routine and work responsibilities. Exercise was extremely easy and my lungs felt great so I was able to run and continue weightlifting during the entire treatment. See December 30th for full treatment dosage. From 10/10 to 7/10 good for short term use (x<14).",Kris
6,Prednisone,Sinusitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 6, 2020",77,"I’ve half chronic sinus infections for years. I’ve been in hundreds of antibiotics, been to multiple ENT’s and done allergy testing. When my sinuses get really bad I get an antibiotic and prednisone. Though the side effects can be tough it makes my nose feel 100x better 100x quicker. On prednisone I get heart palpitations and bursts of energy. Some nights I wake up sweaty with bad dreams, others to stuff my face with food. I only usually take it for 3-7 days and then I’m good but boy is it worth it. It kicks the sinus infection out so much faster and stronger than just an antibiotic.",KT
7,Prednisone,Sinusitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 2, 2020",51,"I have had too many sinus ops. Consequently my sinuses are apparently wrecked. I live with chronic sinus issues. But now and then that chronic sinusitis results in extreme discomfort, brain fog etc. So a couple of times each year I have to go on the Prednisolone. 2x 25 mg daily then tapering. I’m fully aware that this type of drug is not good for one’s system. Apart from that the side-effect I really notice is that it wrecks my sleep. Apparently no matter what time of day one takes this drug,  it stays in the system. But it works for me. The yellow gunk starts to clear out of my sinuses within a day, and I then start to feel normal and comfortable again. Best thing ever for me.",Wenno
8,Prednisone,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 30, 2019",53,"I had surgery over a decade ago consisting of repairing my deviated septum and inferior turbinate reduction which completely cured my sinusitis...(for 11 years). Unfortunately, I just got the worst sinusitis infection probably ever and the first one since that surgery. The infection spread to my eye sockets and after 3 antibiotics aside from my eye infection being under control, I was still sick and up all night several nights coughing. I was put on Prednisone 5 days ago and I'm noticing a huge improvement. I'm not coughing all night. I have energy again, and have been able to work out for the first time in ten weeks. I'm keto so I'm not sure if my blood sugar has jumped, but I also take two tbsp of ACV diluted in 8 tbsp  of water twice a day which you can look up empirical study results on as it relates to diabetes prevention. My dose  of prednisone is 3 days of 10mg 4X, 3 days 10mg 3X, 3 days of 10mg 2X, 3 days of 10mg 1 dose. I hope this information helps. I don't really detect any side effects.",Kris
9,Prednisone,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 25, 2019",26,"As far back as I can remember I’ve had sinus problems. I had a few years of respite but can’t figure out what I was doing right then and wrong now. I have tested negative for allergies, but the symptoms are always worse in Spring/Summer so I take antihistamines but it’s usually at this time my sinusitis reaches critical mass and I find Prednisone is the only relief. So 10/10 from me.",Phoebe
10,Prednisone,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 14, 2019",35,"Acquired Sinusitis after a flu. After an antibiotic shot and Amoxi-Clav antibiotics, my Sinusitis was worse after 2 days: extreme head pressure, seriously EXTREME jaw pain, severe tooth pain (from my swollen sinus pressing on the roots of my top teeth), sinus headache, bone pain under my eye. Just awful. The next day I started Prednisone. My insurance didn’t cover it, so it cost me $11.50 USD out of pocket. The dose was 3 tiny tablets the first day, then 2 tablets the next day, then 1 tablet. I stopped after day 1 because I was scared of side effects. After taking that first dose, I was back to normal again! The jaw pain, the pressure, terrible tooth pain— all gone within 2 hours. My side effects after one dose were racing thoughts, extra saliva in my mouth with a metal taste, and my sense of taste was heightened (which I thought was great). I took the dose after a meal to avoid nausea, and I took it at 2pm. Time on medication was 1 day.",Sinusitis One-Time Sufferer
11,Prednisone,Sinusitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 3, 2019",6,Little dizziness but when I had a sip of a mixed drink (alcohol beverage) the dizziness got worst.

12,Prednisone,Sinusitis,10.0,,"August 25, 2019",16,"In 2017 I had a virus and it attacked my sinus right side deviated septum.  The pain was a 10, right eyebrow area and the only thing that worked was prednisone 20 mg given by my PA, advil and tylenol too. All was great up to July 2019, again a virus same problem, this time my PA was on vacation, told Dr. Of what worked in 2017 gave her exact prescription paper and she said she ordered same for me. Well I trusted her and never checked dose just looked at instructions on how to take it, by 4 days had a little relief but realized that in 2017 by 2nd day I had relief, sure enough I looked and she had order 1/2 mgs of the 2017 dose! After 4 days of taking all the meds it came back bad as the first time. I did use Benadryl sinus and headache med. 1/2 tablet and it did help some. I went to see sinus dr and they agreed that the dose was to small and not long enough. They gave it to me same as in 2017 and 2nd day lot of relief, so we will see if at end it does work and not come back like in 2019",Cat

14,Prednisone,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 11, 2019",47,"I have chronic sinusitis and a large hole in my septum. I've been advised by my ENT that surgery is not an option,  due to the size of the hole. Many antibiotics, saline, antihistamine, thousands spent on purifying our home and even giving away my cat to a friend... nothing. Prednisone is the only treatment which has provided much appreciated relief. If I could stay on it permanently, I would. For now, I just appreciate the intermittent courses. Each clear day is a blessing.",Pixie

I can't afford the ballonplasty surgery so this is my best option. After 1st day my inflammation reduced and the yellow goop finally started draining. My sinus holes are too small.

16,Prednisone,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 1, 2019",33,Day 3 of constant forehead and temple pain and pressure along with stiffness on my neck. I was taking 1000mg of tyleno and 200mg of Aleve and they were not working.  I was considering going the ER as I was in tears at day 3. I have a really high pain threshold and when my husband saw me in tears he got concerned. Before making the trip to the ER I decided to use the app resource through my insurance. He diagnosed me with a sinus headache and prescribed 10mg of Prednisone. My first dose was 60mg. Within an hour I began to feel relief. I was really amazed at how quickly and efficiently it treated the awful main and pressure I felt.,atxblueviolet

While taking the steroid for 12 days, I gained 6 lbs, had severe insomnia every night, diarrhea 2 or 3 times a day, no energy at all. I was extremely irritable and very difficult to be around. I should've listened to my wife and requested what works for me, zpak and went on my way. No more doc in a box for me, and no more prednisone.",Darryl

21,Prednisone,Sinusitis,1.0,,"October 14, 2018",16,"I have been a long time sufferer of allergies since childhood and was diagnosed with chronic obstructive polyps as an adult. My allergy specialist recommend taking prednisone because I am an extreme risk for sinus surgery. I took this medication in hope that I could be able to breathe again through my nose, but alas to my dismay the medication had no effect whatsoever to shrinking my polyps in both nasal cavities and my nasal passages remain inflamed. The first round of doses of prednisone. I took for one week straight in 20 mg and tapered off and the second round started at 60mg per week tapered down to 20mg for the fifth week still no change, no shrinkage of nasal polyps and inflammation remains so bad that I am unable to get any sleep and when I am forced to mouth breathe to sleep I stop breathing all together and wake up.

22,Prednisone,Sinusitis,10.0,,"October 4, 2018",23,"Allergy doc gave me Prednisone for chronic sinus problems that resulted in a painful ear infection with bloody pus discharge. My ear hurt so bad from the inside out that it hurt too bad to even sleep on it. Ended up that the infection caused a perforated ear drum. The prednisone, along with a prescription nasal spray and antibiotics got rid of the problem. Instead of taking 4 the first day and tapering down, I spaced out 2 the first day, then took one a day thereafter. After the antibiotics ran out I held on to the remainder and spaced them out one a day every time symptoms started to flare up again. Doc gave me a refill so I can take one in a given day to help my body start to heal the sinus problem. My sinus problems are not due to hay fever or other obvious triggers, but are more year-round and likely related to my fibromyalgia and/or CNS/obstructive sleep apnea. Glad to keep these around for when literally nothing else works.",Sniffles

While it did get rid of the inflammation within a day the side effects made it not worth it. This is the worst drug I have ever taken in my life. Unless it's life or death I do NOT recommend taking this. It initially gave me a sense of euphoria, which only lasted a few days, and then I experienced the worst anxiety/depression in my life. I had no appetite. Couldn't function. Was scared to be alone was soo depressed. The worst part was that the nurse that prescribed it to me didn't inform me of these possible side effects.

Both times in high doses (60mg)/day, tapering down after several days. It is effective, and quickly, however I hate the side effects. I would not recommend taking at night as it gives me tons of energy and keeps me awake. I tend to get hot flashes or steep changes in temperature, and VERY irritable.

I have taken too many antibiotics and do the ENT prescribed prednisone 30 mg for 3 days then 20 for 2 days then 10 then done.  Sounded simple enough even though I had been putting off prednisone for a year. I also take klonopin low dose for an anxiety condition. I know my hyper sensitivity to meds so the first night I took half the initial dosage. I woke up early the next morning with a racing mind and high anxiety. The racing mind scared me.
