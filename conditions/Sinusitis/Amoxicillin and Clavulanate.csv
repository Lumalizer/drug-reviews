I have a history of severe anxiety and am generally sensitive to medications. I had a tooth extraction and bone graft but also ended up with ear and sinus pain. I was given Augmentin and figured I'd be fine. I took the first dose and was okay. The next morning I had very loose stool and a bit elevated heart rate. The second dose in the evening, I had a horrible panic attack to the point where I nearly passed out/went to the hospital. The next morning I took my dose and ended up with an awful panic attack again a few hours later. Thats when I called my doctor and was told to switch to Amoxicillin. Everyones body reacts different.

My ears feel better but I started another allergy med at the same time so I don't know if it's due to that or this. I certainly wouldn't take this med unless you really need it.

I am 48 years old, 5’1 and was 153 pounds. After this medication I had severe anaphylactic shock on day 2 after I took a 2nd pill. Chest pains, could not breath, felt like losing consciousness and ended up in ER. They could not figure anything out, and after 3 days developed peripheral neuropathic burning pain all over my arms, legs, back, and scalp. No doctor can help me now to heal me from this damage.  I saw a neurologist, dermatologist, an allergist,  and primary care! I have to now take gabapentin as nothing else helps me with severe pain after amoxicillin.  Folks think for yourselves.  This is a terrible drug that can lead to disability as I was a very healthy woman before who used to work full time and practice Yoga. Now I depend on pain medications such as gabapentin for nerve pain, and extra strength Tylenol.  This drug ruined my life. Do not take it.",Olechka

The key here is food. Avoid anything that upsets your guts. Eat something right before taking the pill and eat a probiotics yogurt 2-3 hours after taking the pill. This will help with angry tummy & also help prevent yeast inflections caused by antibiotics, ladies. Don’t skip a meal and snack on crackers or the likes throughout the day.

14,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Sinusitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 30, 2021",5,I’m on day 3 of 5 Amox Clav 875 125 . I have a terrible sinus infection. Day one my stomach felt a little nauseous. Next day I had diarrhea it lasted the day I ate some bananas and drank a yogurt smoothie and it seemed to help . I think the stomach upset and diarrhea was just my body adjusting to the antibiotics. Today is day 3 and my stomach is calm but I do feel really tired and low energy. My sinuses are not so clogged I can breath a lot better so the medication seems to be working . I would recommend for sinus infection because I know how stuffy and miserable I felt and I would definitely deal with the side effects to be better .

Nothing else, but also taking a basic, cheap, acidophilus tablet daily to ward off candida, etc.  There has been no change.  I am wondering if this generic isn't quite right.  But I doubt this is the problem.  (I note that this medication should be clearing up a skin problem, as that is one of the uses - and it isn't doing that either).  So.  Is it not a good generic?
