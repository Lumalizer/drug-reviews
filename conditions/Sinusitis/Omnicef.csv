0,Omnicef,Sinusitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 12, 2021",0,"This medicine made me feel worse than the original symptoms. I usually have a high tolerance for meds, don’t usually get dizzy or feel nauseous ever. But this medicine made me feel as I was suffering from being hung over. I would drive 8 hours later after taking the meds and would feel like I could black out whenever. I would randomly feel nauseous. The headaches were a constant theme. Now that I’ve read the comments I can attribute some of the diarrhea I had to it to. I went back to the dr and was prescribed Doxycycline so I’m on day 4 and I feel better but still suffer from a cough.",NotGoneLie
1,Omnicef,Sinusitis,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 7, 2020",1,On the third day of taking omnicef I realized I was again constipated which is usually the norm for me but I've noticed more gas and extremely foul odor from my stools that I can't describe.,Nay
2,Omnicef,Sinusitis,1.0,,"August 20, 2018",21,"I started taking this for a sinus infection. The first 5 days I was fine and just added extra yogurt in my diet to be safe. By day 6 I  had a little bit of diarrhea which was expected. It turned into diarrhea every 45 minutes until I had nothing left for the next 24 hours. Then it was like my bowels were being turned inside out and all that came out was black mucus. I immediately stopped the medication. I’ve been about 36 hours without it and things are slowly looking up. But I have had to miss work and other events because of it. My doctor said this was safe for those that are allergic to amoxicillin but apparently not. I do not recommend this to anyone. If you read most other reviews, it’s about the same thing.",R

But I was given a 21 day dosage for (2) 300mg capsules.  I have had 4 sinus infections since January.  Hope it helps get rid of the headache.  It has helped with the drainage and coughing though.",Bootscasper

6,Omnicef,Sinusitis,4.0,,"November 2, 2013",53,"Fantastic at clearing the sinus infection. I'm on day 4 and it's almost completely gone. The first two days were miraculous. But then. Starting day 3 ...My stomach and intestines are rumbling almost constantly and I'm ""pooping"" brown water 5+ times a day. I'm also utterly exhausted and weak, making it virtually impossible to actually do anything. If this gets much worse, I'm going to have to stop using this before the 10-day course runs out.",t.i.g

13,Omnicef,Sinusitis,8.0,,"April 10, 2009",41,"Omnicef was effective in treating my daughter's sinusitis. However, she broke out in hives a day after finishing the medication.  Although it is not certain the medicine caused her hives, it is very ironic that they broke out within 24 hours of finishing the antibiotic.",jhharman1
