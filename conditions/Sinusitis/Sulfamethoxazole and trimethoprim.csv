6,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 19, 2020",2,40 minutes after taking 1 pill my penis began to feel very warm and the skin around the head of my penis was swelling. I called the the doctor and they said probably a fixed drug eruption. The skin around my penis swelled so bad and hurt bad and then in the morning was even worse and all the skin was peeling... My entire pubic area was sore and red. I went to the ER and the doctor there thought it also caused balantis. They did give me another kind of antibiotic but this stuff did a number on me. Also that night I took the 1 pill I felt overall like I had the flu coming on. It was horrible. I am only 3 days out from taking 1 pill and my penis swelling is a lot better but where the skin came off is really tender yet. I will never take this pill again.,tony

8,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Sinusitis,10.0,,"September 28, 2020",15,Bactrim works best for my sinusitis.

I had never been given this antibiotic, but have also never had issues with any antibiotic, so I didn’t have any concerns. I ate dinner then immediately took my first pill. Within 2 hours of taking it I could visibly see the bloating in my stomach with some mild stomach discomfort. 2 hours after that the severe nausea sat in. The nausea was HORRIBLE!! Then the diarrhea started, which was awful. I did throw up one time, but I think that was induced by drinking too much water. I was afraid I was going to dehydrate. I also experience terrible heart palpitations & weakness. The terrible side effects only lasted about 6hrs. I’m a little over 24 hrs from all this & I feel much better, but stomach still isn’t right & just have an overall feeling of weakness.

So I stopped taking it. To my surprise, Bactrim can have horrible side effects, which I experienced every one of them. I had a 101 degree fever, chills, skin rash, heart palpitations, aches and pains beyond what any human should suffer, for 5 days afterwards. I thought I was going to have a heart attack and that would be it for me . When my body told me to sleep, I slept. And I did a lot of sleeping because I knew that my body seriously needed the rest to try and repair itself from all of the side effects I stated. It took my 10 full days to even fell semi-normal again. If the rating system would allow, I would give this drug a negative 10 for being so destructive.",BelmarGuy

23,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Sinusitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 1, 2019",86,"Bactrim DS (sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim):Like many others, I read review after review on here of negative experiences, making myself terrified of taking this drug. As someone who is so worried about throwing up that I carry anti-nausea medication with me everywhere I go, I was very reluctant to begin 6 weeks of Bactrim after reading all of these reviews.Fortunately, I experienced no major side effects and it seems to be helping with the infection. Some very mild nausea at first that was likely anxiety-induced, and acid reflux which is common with all antibiotics. Yogurt and a probiotic daily helps with this.Anyway, I promised myself that I would write a positive review if I ended up having a positive experience, so here it is. If you're worried like I was, remember that people are way more inclined to post drug reviews online when they have negative experiences, than normal or positive ones. The vast majority of people taking Bactrim feel absolutely fine, and keeping this in mind may help ease your fears as well.",ParanoidForNothing

Best thing to do is avoid dust, pollutants and keep your house super clean- I have times where I can go 6 to 10 months no antibiotics— but they are the only thing that works.

No major side effects apart from nausea bit eating small amounts of food at regular intervals is helping. No upset stomach or stomach pains which surprised me due to having IBS. Anyone suffering side effects always remember that any antibiotic will cause you to feel unwell. You have to persevere with it and they will ease.
