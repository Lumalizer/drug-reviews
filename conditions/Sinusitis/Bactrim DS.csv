0,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 1, 2020",6,"*Don’t do It!!!I was feeling ok before taking it. Heck I was running 2 miles a day before. No issues with other then my sinus being inflamed and closed. On day 2 I started getting nauseated. Day 3-4 and 6 I went to the ER. Dire pain, blood in urine. Chest pain that prevented sleeping radiating to my back. Bloating, gas, regurgitation, constipation. But worst of all I couldn’t eat. I got really weak and honestly didn’t think I was going to make it. I spent days in bed not moving due to the pain. I got a small rash day 5 on my arms. On day 6 of 14 I stopped the medication. Symptoms improve almost immediately. Still have chest pain but getting better.",Jake
1,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 31, 2019",16,I’m currently taking Bactrim twice a day for a sinus infection. I've taken it before for the same thing and I seem to recall its just about the ONLY antibiotic that doesn’t feel like it’s is really bad for me in the process!  I’m also taking a steroid pak at the same time. Don’t be afraid to take it; everyone’s body reacts differently.,Marilyn
2,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 13, 2019",6,"I had been on  Bactrim 800/160 mg. 2 x's a day sinus infection included smelling something burnt everywhere I went it was the same smell plus ears felt congested and I couldn't hear well,e yes were watering glands in neck were swelled started healing in 2 days, but cramping started so went to E.R. They admitted me overnight with IV fluids helped some but not a whole lot, then was changed to clindamyacin. In a few days I smelt the burnt smell coming back as well as the ear congestion and cramping never really subsided.  I called pharmacy got reacted magnesium for cramping it helped and that night and slept like a log so I thought I would try and start the bactrim again.  Well I took it before I went to bed the next day I felt cramping coming back again so I took 2  magnesium read that it has to be 4 hours apart to take meds after magnesium while Im waiting for for magnesium to work cramping didn't seem to wanna subside now I have to go back to doctor and explain all this",Anonymous
3,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 9, 2019",5,"I was given Bactrim DS for an ear and sinus infection. I had never been given this antibiotic, but have also never had issues with any antibiotic, so I didn’t have any concerns. I ate dinner then immediately took my first pill. Within 2 hours of taking it I could visibly see the bloating in my stomach with some mild stomach discomfort. 2 hours after that the severe nausea sat in. The nausea was HORRIBLE!! Then the diarrhea started, which was awful. I did throw up one time, but I think that was induced by drinking too much water. I was afraid I was going to dehydrate. I also experience terrible heart palpitations & weakness. The terrible side effects only lasted about 6hrs. I’m a little over 24 hrs from all this & I feel much better, but stomach still isn’t right & just have an overall feeling of weakness. The dr told me to immediately stop the antibiotic, which was the only option for me. She said it sounded like I had a sulphate intolerance.",RachiePie
4,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2019",3,A lot of people mentioning vomiting and nausea. Be aware that you cannot drink ANY alcohol while on Bactrim. It can make you vomit or cause nausea. It’s very effective for certain UTIs depending on the strain of bacteria. Told this by my pharmacist and doctor. Unsure about sinus but I’m trying that now.,Deb
5,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 8, 2019",14,"Developed sinusitis with heavy pressure in ears, drainage, swollen throat/glands, etc  Prescribed Badtrim-DS for seven day course, twice daily. Within 12 hours swelling was nearly gone, pain reduced to minimal. Did experience restlessness, sleeplessness, and some dehydration despite drinking a lot of water. Seems like it dealt with the infection itself, but still dealt with sinus problems ( drainage, congestion in ears, and coughing due to drainage) for several days after. **Bactrim is a Sulfa- product, so doc made sure I wasn't allergic before prescribing.",Christo
6,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 10, 2019",11,"This is HORRIBLE medication! I was on Bactrim for only 3 days for sinusitis, then on day 4 I had hives and my face was BURNING from the inside out but no fever. Went off it. Then day 5,6 and on 7 now and my jaw aches  and my face feels like it’s going to implode. Strangest feeling. I’m dizzy have a headache but the facial tightening and burning is making me crazy. This stuff is scary and have no idea when it’s going to stop. Never again",Sydney
7,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 1, 2019",86,"Like many others, I read review after review on here of negative experiences, making myself terrified of taking this drug. As someone who is so worried about throwing up that I carry anti-nausea medication with me everywhere I go, I was very reluctant to begin 6 weeks of Bactrim after reading all of these reviews.Fortunately, I experienced no major side effects and it seems to be helping with the infection. Some very mild nausea at first that was likely anxiety-induced, and acid reflux which is common with all antibiotics. Yogurt and a probiotic daily helps with this.Anyway, I promised myself that I would write a positive review if I ended up having a positive experience, so here it is. If you're worried like I was, remember that people are way more inclined to post drug reviews online when they have negative experiences, than normal or positive ones. The vast majority of people taking Bactrim feel absolutely fine, and keeping this in mind may help ease your fears as well.",ParanoidForNothing
8,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 26, 2018",6,I literally took 3 pills and had to stop. I was worried it was a stomach virus but nope it was Bactrim. I’m not sensitive to antibiotics but this was horrible. I threw up and felt nauseous about 12 hours after the third pill.,MommyM
9,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 8, 2018",13,"I just wanted to pop in and say Bactrim is a Sulpha drug. A lot of people are allergic to Sulpha and some are allergic to the trimethoprim part as well. Those of you having a reaction, this is probably why. You also need to tell your Dr you're allergic to Sulpha drugs or trimethoprim so they don't prescribe you any! Be well!",Vikingwarmaiden
10,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 7, 2018",16,"Hope I'm not responding prematurely, but I feel improvement within 24 hours.  Still have 12 days to go.",Elliemae
11,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 26, 2018",32,"Don’t believe  everything you read here.  I took this drug for a sinus infection I developed on a plane coming from overseas. Within four hours  I started feeling better. Took about five days until I  felt completely well. When I went to see the doctor, I had a temperature of 100.3 and felt bad. This drug may not be for everyone but it worked for me. No side effects.",Marylin
12,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 20, 2018",6,"I took bactrim ds twice a day for 10 days for a stubborn sinus infection. On day 6 I started to get chills, cold hands and feet then the crippling body aches and pains started. Even my buttocks is painful! I also became very weak! It's been 2 weeks since I've finished the bactrim and I am STILL in excruciating pain everywhere,  back, legs, arms, buttocks and very weak. I WILL NEVER TAKE THIS AGAIN! I hope this goes away soon and it's not permanent damage to my body.  Everyday is a struggle because of the terrible aches and pains. This drug should be BANNED!",Aquarius11

15,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 5, 2017",5,I recently took Bactrim for a sinus infection. My first day of taking the bactrim. I got nervous  and my hands started to itch I couldn't sit still. I broke out in a red rash on shoulder and left hand and my feet is red and both sides. But I had previously took bactrim before over the years with no problems. And this time I was shocked because I had taken it before. So I went to the Urgent Care and they told me not to take it any more. So I am throwing the cheap in the trash. And I just hope that my sinus will heal on its own.,Cine
16,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,2.0,,"June 1, 2017",3,"It did help the sinusitis.  The side effects were awful.  Yeast infection that took 6 pills of diflucan to get rid of.  I had blisters.. most about 2"" to 3"" in circumference on my legs thighs and back.  It took a while for them to heal too. My joints ached. Definitely on my never to take again list.",ZeeGee
17,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2017",6,"I was recently prescribed Bactrim DS for my chronic sinusitis  by my ENT. I informed her that I had been prescribed Bactrim in the past, although I did not inform her that it was lesser strength of the two  and after eight and a half days of taking two a day I finally had to stop due to the side effects that were occurring. I took the first dosage and felt fatigued and slightly itchy. I reminded myself tho that when I am overtired and restless that I tend to feel itchy so I took a shower and and slept for a while and I was fine. The following few days I had no problems besides light bloating and fatigue. I kept taking my medication as prescribed and after the fifth day I was having radiating pain around the left and right side of my sternum",jpxj86

Recent sinus infections I took a Z-pack and was done but this time was my first time taking Bactrim - DS. Painful headaches, stomach aches, constipation even after drinking water frequently daily.

19,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,1.0,,"September 12, 2015",14,"Started meds on Monday.  My arms and legs hurt terribly Tuesday and Wednesday.  The headache has been the worst I have ever had.  Chills, sweating, nausea, impaired vision, insomnia.  I called the Dr's office Wednesday afternoon and the nurse told me to give it a few more days. Went to different Dr on Saturday and he said bactrim is notorious for headaches and other adverse effects. Off of it now and have to wait 24 hours before I can start a new antibiotic.  I'm praying this headache ends soon",Mreid207

21,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,1.0,,"January 29, 2015",12,"I took this for four and a half days. I experienced complete appetite loss, nausea, fatigue, abdominal pain, and anxiety.  I had blood work done before I took the Bactrim and when I got my results back it turned out I didn't have a bacterial infection at all. All that for nothing. I still haven't completely recovered my appetite and it has been almost a week since my last dose.",Telewit8530

25,Bactrim DS,Sinusitis,5.0,,"January 25, 2012",19,"I took Bactrim DS after the first antibiotic didn't work on my sinus infection. I started to feel better after 4 days, however I developed joint pain in my hands and knees. I have arthritis from an autoimmune disease, but it's usually controlled very well by a maintenance medicine. On day 8 I noted lots of swollen glands in my neck and a slight temp. After I took my antibiotic that night my fever shot up to 103, I was shaking, teeth chattering, with severe joint/muscle pain, my face looked sunburned, and my body was red/blotchy. I stopped the Bactrim, but the fever lasted 2-3 days, the arthritis was severe for about a week and I still have fatigue. Good news is ENT did recheck and infection is gone.",suzykale
