0,Biaxin,Sinusitis,1.0,,"September 29, 2019",15,"One dose of this medicine  Biaxin left me with severe heart arythmia and messed with my mind. I felt like I was on LCD. I took it once before a couple decades ago and had similar but lesser side effects. I'm not sure if I was prescribed a larger than normal dose since I was in Germany, but the side effects are very dangerous.",James
1,Biaxin,Sinusitis,10.0,,"April 30, 2019",15,"I just came down with sinusitis, something I've had in past years.  I'm now in the second day of taking Biaxin's generic (Clarithromycin )  and on day one, several hours after the first dose I began to feel better.  Now into day two the symptoms have lessened but they're still there.  I've had good luck with Biaxin in the past, and its generic is living up to that performance.  10 days should clear this up completely.",Prof321
2,Biaxin,Sinusitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 11, 2019",14,"I started coming down with a chest cold that I knew would turn into bronchitis.  I called my doctor and he prescribed Biaxin 500mg twice daily as I ended up having sinusitis as well. After the 3rd day of taking this med, I was feeling better and not coughing quite as much. I had no side effects and rated this a 9 because of the after taste it leaves in your mouth. I always ate something before taking it and had no stomach issues. Overall, this really helped me get through my sickness.",Daisy
3,Biaxin,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2019",11,I battled a sinus infection for almost 3 months.  I had pain above my eye and maxillary sinuses.  I had green/yellow thick discharge coming out of my nose from the front and back.  At the beginning of the infection at about 2 weeks in I took Augmentin with no luck.  I suffered for almost 2 more months until going on the Biaxin.  After 1 week of the medication all of my symptoms were gone.  I was worried I would need surgery if this didn't work.  As for side effects the only one I noticed was the taste in my mouth but it was subtle and not that bad.  Stomach was fine as I took a probiotic yogurt every day.  This drug was amazing.,George
4,Biaxin,Sinusitis,10.0,,"May 4, 2018",11,"I have had sinus surgery due to chronic sinus infections that would not relent. (turns out I had an abscess)After three different antibiotics the ENT finally cultured my sinuses and Biaxin was the big winner!It works for me every time and I can tell a difference within 12 hours of taking first dose.If you have chronic sinus infections, get an ENT.",Michelle
5,Biaxin,Sinusitis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 1, 2018",4,"Since taking clarithromycin, I have lost 3 pounds in a single week and I struggle to regain weight.  I'm already thin and this stuff has lasting effects which are undesired.",streible
6,Biaxin,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 28, 2017",7,I used this twice and worked each time. However I used clav recently for swelling in my chin and while it the clav is bringing down the swelling. The sinusitis is coming back! I think I will need to go on a dose of biaxin after this clav.,Sinusitis King
7,Biaxin,Sinusitis,10.0,,"February 5, 2017",28,"After being sick for a month and a half, after a useless round of Amoxclav, my doctor finally prescribed Biaxin and Prednidone for my sinus infection.  Within a day I was able to breathe through my nose.  My only complaint is the absolutely disgusting aftertaste...and the occasional upset stomach.  I think the side effects are worth it as I finally feel good for the first time in weeks.",ElleMichelle999
8,Biaxin,Sinusitis,10.0,,"July 30, 2016",27,"i always get sinusitis on a yearly basis.  on my worst occasion, i tried 'em all from Zythromax to Ammoxicillian, etc.  none worked for me.  ONLY Biaxin works!!  MD says its not the most recommended antibiotic for sinusitis but does work and is the only one that works for me.Yes ~ it does leave a metallic taste in my mouth, but i like knowing its in my system and attacking my problem so i don't mind the taste at all...  i was also told it is a very old antibiotic, but its an ""Oldie but Goodie""!!Some insurance will cover it while others will not.","golden years, phooey"
9,Biaxin,Sinusitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 6, 2016",27,"I read a bunch of reviews from people who have mentioned having upset stomachs and yeast infections. I used to have those issues on antiobiotics, but then I learned that taking a very strong probiotic (I take the refrigerated ones from Jarro) and a feminine probiotic with lactobaccilus eliminates or at least greatly reduces those issues. I strongly recommend taking both whenever you take antiobiotics.For this one, I agree that you definitely need to take it with a reasonable amount of food. The metallic taste comes and goes but is generally tolerable. I do feel loopy, but I am guessing that has more to do with how sick I am than anything else. Hope this helps.",erky
10,Biaxin,Sinusitis,9.0,,"June 9, 2015",34,the only medication cleared my sinus infection. i have been on it for a month and my dr wants me to continue for another 4 weeks. I have not experienced any of side effects so far.,noname1000
11,Biaxin,Sinusitis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 25, 2015",28,"have used Biaxin (actually now always the generic version) for many years. Works great for me, always makes me feel much better within 12-18 hours of taking the first pill. Never had ANY side effects, except metallic taste - which has never bothered me (never been very strong). Great drug, wonderful for my chronic sinusitis. (Hint: I eat lots of miso when taking antibiotics; does wonders for my GI when taking antibiotics. Miso soup, miso on top of rice, miso in various dishes; just make sure you get the longest fermented one you can find - I buy 2-yr miso.)",Jb-in-VA
12,Biaxin,Sinusitis,9.0,,"August 14, 2013",87,"I too have had multiple sinus infections and surgery twice. In addition I am immunosuppressed because of a medication for rheumatoid arthritis. Biaxin has always worked for me. I really have no side effects other than the metallic taste which is tolerable. I make sure I take it after food otherwise it is really hard on the stomach. I take Biaxin XL 500mg, 2 tablets once a day for 14 days.",25skidoo
13,Biaxin,Sinusitis,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 4, 2013",45,I was on this for the first time last fall when I had H. Pylori. It knocked it out but threw me into my first vaginal yeast infection. The metallic taste in the mouth is horrible and my husband could even taste it when he kissed me. Currently I am on it for sinusitis which I have seasonal.,Joretta
14,Biaxin,Sinusitis,8.0,,"February 25, 2013",116,"I have had MANY sinus infections over the years, and Biaxin is the only thing that really gets rid of them. Yes, you have a horrible (metallic) taste in your mouth, are a bit loopy, and tummy isn't the best, but those side effects are nothing compared to serious sinus pain. I'd rather be thirsty than feel like my head is in a vice all day!",Anonymous5

17,Biaxin,Sinusitis,5.0,,"November 4, 2011",31,"Second antibiotic I've been on for this sinus infection (Z-pack didn't clear it up).  I am slowly getting better, but I have all the unpleasant but evidently not dangerous side effects, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, sour taste in my mouth. I dread taking the pill, because for the next two hours I have to lay my head on my desk because of nausea and dizziness. Even at night, I go to sleep, but wake up three hours later feeling like I'm going to vomit.",Anonymous
18,Biaxin,Sinusitis,1.0,,"December 31, 2010",32,"I have been prescribed Biaxin twice in the past three months. The first onset of sinusitis took 6 weeks to clear. 1 week before Christmas it comes back with the worst pressure, 2 ER visits later they tell me the sinusitis is back. This round with Biaxin has left me: dehydrated, constant bathroom trips after eating anything, weight loss (12lbs in 2 weeks). ",MR86er
19,Biaxin,Sinusitis,1.0,,"March 5, 2010",30,"I was prescribed this for a sinus infection twice. First time was last year. It worked and I felt better in about five days. However I had nausea and a nasty taste in my mouth every time I took it. This year it was prescribed for the same thing. I still have the sinus infection, and the side effects were worse. My doctor chose this drug because I am allergic to sulfa drugs.",Anonymous

Not sure if it's the Biaxin, the dripping from her sinuses, or the combination.  The doctor didn't seem too concerned unless it persists.  ",ljcaplan

22,Biaxin,Sinusitis,1.0,,"May 4, 2009",16,"The first night I was nauseated, but thought it was just from the sinus infection. Two nights later I started to itch all over, thought maybe it was something else and have been itching ever since (2 days ago). Also have thrush. I have been eating yogurt and it's not doing anything for it. I suppose the itching isn't as bad as the pain, but it's equally as annoying.",Anonymous
23,Biaxin,Sinusitis,1.0,,"April 14, 2009",54,"Might work for others, but I came down with most of the adverse side effects within hours of taking one 500mg tab. Ended up in emergency 12 hours later with difficulty breathing from swollen airways. Hives. Scary part was how it can effects the mind. I had residual effects for a number of days.",Spiltmilk

26,Biaxin,Sinusitis,10.0,,"June 27, 2008",68,"Biaxin (or the generic) has always worked WONDERS for me in treating chronic sinusitis or sinus infection (also concurrent ear infection).  It smacks it right out of you the 1st time, you don't wind up at the doctors again after taking something less effective. I ask for it by name (am allergic to penicillin and sulphur, so neither of those are ever an option for me).",Anonymous
27,Biaxin,Sinusitis,4.0,,"June 27, 2008",62,"I was put on Biaxin for a major sinus infection. 500 mg twice daily for one month. Pharmacist told me that sinus infections can take a very long time to go away. I definitely feel better but am still having the runny nose, congestion and a little cough still but much less than before. It's been 3 weeks now since I was put on this. Hope it kicks it out of my system. ",Andrew in Campbell
