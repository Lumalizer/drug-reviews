1,Levofloxacin,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 6, 2021",0,After taking it for 2 days I had a horrible anxiety attack and muscle pain and weekness. After 5 days it hasn't helped my sinus infection at all and I discussed alternatives with my doctor today. Unfortunately due to penicillin allergy and stomach problems its my only option. Hopefully after taking the full 10 course I'll fell better,Denwig
2,Levofloxacin,Sinusitis,10.0,,"September 24, 2021",0,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):41/F I had a serious sinus infection for over a year after having Covid — I took so many antibiotics that didn’t help at all — augmentin, doxycycline, amoxicillin, and a few others. Then they took several cultures that showed the bacteria citrobacter k. present, which is resistant to most antibiotics. I was put on Cipro for 20 days, then again for 14 days. Didn’t help much. The only other option for oral / non-IV antibiotics for this bacteria was Levaquin. I’m on Day 5 of 14 and already seeing a huge improvement, unlike any other antibiotic used. I’m hopeful it will eventually go away completely. I haven’t noticed any side effects, I have a physical job and I’m physically active and I haven’t noticed any issues with tendons etc. When I asked about the side effects some people get, namely the issues with tendons and joints, my physician said that is more likely if you’re overweight or over 60.",Chicagoland79

6,Levofloxacin,Sinusitis,1.0,,"March 11, 2020",6,This drug has caused a great deal of discomfort and pain to my legs and arms.  I got a concussion 2 years ago and still have difficulty comprehending technical reading material.  There were approximately 8 pages of possible side effects.  I assumed the doctor or pharmacist would inform me of anything important. No one did.  Even when I complained to the doctor about how sore my legs were since taking taking Levoflaxicin he didn’t say one word.  I it’s now been approximately 3 months since I took it.

I was warned about the black box by my doctor but, I don't even know if that matters at this point. I experienced extreme tendon, joint and ligament swelling for over 48 hours. That was nothing tho, compared to the nerve pain in my arms and extreme weakness. Three days later since taking just one and the weakness/electric shocks are now in my legs too. I can't even hold a glass or balance myself properly while walking. Just typing is difficult. My doctor basically told me ""This could get better, this could get worse or it could just never change. There's no treatment and people improve or don't at different rates from anywhere to weeks to months to years."" TL;DR: Don't take Levaquin, even if you have handled Cipro in the past. It's not worth it, unless it's an emergency and life threatening infection. I now have to just hope I improve.",Sel

9,Levofloxacin,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2020",4,"I went to an after hours clinic to treat my sinus infection. The doctor prescribed me 500mg of Levofloxacin at 1 pill a day for 5 days. I took my first dose that night and had horrible anxiety and heart palpitations. I fought bad nausea the whole night too. The effects lasted for 2 days after I took that 1 pill. The next morning I started to get strange feelings in my left leg. It's hard to describe but, it feels like a dull ache in your muscles. I also started to get an odd tingling/numbing sensation in my left leg as well. This feeling (obviously) alarmed me and I immediately stopped taking the medication. I took only that 1 dose, it's been more than a week now and I'm still having issues. I still deal with leg pain/numbness/tingling and now I'm getting a little of it in my left arm. Please don't make the same idiotic mistake that I did and READ about your medication before you take it. Be careful and DON'T take this or any antibiotic in this family unless there is no other choice.",KateKatsuki
10,Levofloxacin,Sinusitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 4, 2020",6,I had a really bad sinus infection as a complication from the flu.  At the end of 14 days Aug I still had some gunk so we decided to switch   Levaquin was chosen. 500mg for 7 days. 6 hours after the first pill I had some weird leg pain around my ankle and my joints seemed tight. Because my doctor educated me I was able to immediately stop and get a new antibiotic1.  Listen to your body. If after one dose you feel off STOP IMMEDIATELY.  It accumulates at the second dose and it’s much worse. 2. Based off of 3 medical opinions I should be in the clear in 48 hours after the dose but to treat the areas that have mild pain as an injury. 3.  Levaquin metabolizes through the kidneys so If after one dose you feel icky start heavy fluids and 100% cranberry juice. Magnesium only helps if it’s still in your stomach or if you’re deficient. I’ll update in a few days to see if the opinions were correct.,Sicky

I sort of got over the November sinusitis and then came down with another in January. I honestly don't think the first one ever went away, leading to the second flare-up. I again agreed to try a different antibiotic, Doxycycline (I’m still babying those tendons from 3 years ago, so why not avoid the Levaquin, right?).
