0,Clopidogrel,Peripheral Arterial Disease,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 15, 2019",18,Plavix (clopidogrel):Lots of bruising and bleeding. The worst part now is hives every day only on one side of my body. It didn’t do anything to help after stents. My legs both got worse after surgery and plavix didn’t stop the stents from clogging up. I keep taking it until I see my PCP next week to see what to do. Vascular surgeon isn’t much  help.,Lotus

3,Clopidogrel,Peripheral Arterial Disease,6.0,,"February 24, 2017",4,Provided under hospitalization. The drug should be used cautiously. Diabetics have to be very careful. Even a simple prick for a routine blood sugar test my yield more blood than usual. The drug is effective for decreasing heat murmur. ,Gus Ry
