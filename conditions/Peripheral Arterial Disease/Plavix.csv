0,Plavix,Peripheral Arterial Disease,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 15, 2019",18,Lots of bruising and bleeding. The worst part now is hives every day only on one side of my body. It didn’t do anything to help after stents. My legs both got worse after surgery and plavix didn’t stop the stents from clogging up. I keep taking it until I see my PCP next week to see what to do. Vascular surgeon isn’t much  help.,Lotus
1,Plavix,Peripheral Arterial Disease,,,"August 28, 2017",21,5 months ago I started feeling a heartburn like pain in the am without any questions I called the EMS less then a half hour later I was told I was having a heart attack. 2 STENTS later at 81% clogged arteries I was told Plavix & Asprin would be with me forever. Till this day it has been working GREAT.,Stillworkingdad

So far no side effects except bruising. I am 65 yrs old, Male with heart disease. Can't take any statins because they cause too much leg muscle pain.",Mike1950
