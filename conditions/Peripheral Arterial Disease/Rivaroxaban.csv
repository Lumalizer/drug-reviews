0,Rivaroxaban,Peripheral Arterial Disease,1,,"August 12, 2021",1,Xarelto (rivaroxaban):Prescription 1 pill every 12 hours. Took 1 pill before bed and 1 pill in morning. Within a hour I was bleeding thru a bruise on arm.  Doctor immediately stopped me from using xarelto. Second part of this explanation has to do with cost. Had I continued to use xarelto I could not afford the $90 every month due to my Rx plans maxium allowance per year. I would have used it all on that one drug and not been able to get any other prescriptions covered.,Anonymous
