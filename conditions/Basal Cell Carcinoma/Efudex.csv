0,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 26, 2022",0,Using Efudex for Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) on my nose. Have finished 24 days and plan to go for 4 more days. My dermatologist feels if it hasn’t done the job then it most likely will not work. My nose has been red since week one then the affected area scabbed over during week two and three it was uncomfortable but tolerable. Since I began week four the pain has become intense at night almost intolerable. I am trying to soldier on but it is very stressful. I am using Tylenol and Benadryl but nothing eases the pain but ice packs.  It feels like someone is driving needles or glass in my nose it’s Brutal. My phone doesn’t recognize me anymore.,Mary
1,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 8, 2021",0,"I was told it won't work on a squamous carcinoma. Applying to the tip of my nose for 3 weeks and only slightly red with no discomfort, hoping its not irritating a squamous cancer! on my face for 10 days so far and red and flaky but no real discomfort. some the stories on here are horrific but so far so good. will do one side of my face and evaluate the benefits. big fan of freezing them off so will weigh it all up.",kzn
2,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 6, 2021",7,"My partner and I started applying Efudix at the same time. Me on my nose and forehead, he on the back of his neck. We've both used it before on specific lesions and had good results. He  started showing red spots within 5 days. I had to wait 10 days before anything showed up and I've taken photos of our journey together! His skin is far more reactive (skin damaged?) than mine and after 3 weeks the back of his neck is a red, sore mass with oozing parts. Time for him to stop treatment and move to recovery. I've applied Efudix to the odd BCC on his back and his skin has responded well and cleared up beautifully. I'm interested to see how the larger area of his neck will respond. Me, I'm still going. Some areas have reached erosion stage and are itchy while a couple of new red spots have just emerged. Looks like I'll be applying for another week until they scab over. Looking forward to the new skin!",Elle
3,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 8, 2020",49,"Ten years ago I used Aldara over my whole face. 20 minutes of pain after each application and a violent reaction after 9 days. Face looked as though I had been in a bad fire and scared the kids at school. It did heal and I looked 10 years younger.I have just finished 3 weeks on Efudex and 3 weeks healing. Skin looks like the proverbial babies bottom and very happy with the results. This time I treated whole face, ears and parts of neck. Applying the Efudex was less painful than the Aldara, even a little bit soothing. Hard to sleep with sore ears. Tried all kinds of moisturisers and they caused stinging for 5-10 minutes. Used vaseline 2-3 times daily and it was by far the most satisfactory. Very pleased with the results. Also treated both arms at the same time. Used 3 tubes of Efudex on this session. Always worked outside and lots of boating. 76 years young now after this treatment.",Boatman
4,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 20, 2020",39,"I am up to my last day of treatment, day 21. I have treated my entire face once a day with efudix and would never do it again. After the first couple of days red spots start to appear, after a week my face looked like a severe case of sunburn and felt like it. The intensity of the redness increased along with constant burning. By day 12 I wad ready to give up but reminded myself I was over half way. I didn't know how I could bear to apply more efudix but perseverance and willpower has been on my side.It is a painful experience which I would only recommend  as a last resort.Even today I dread putting the cream on for the last time but after that I know each day will be a slow pace of healing. I look forward to the end result and hope all the discomfort is worth it",Mango
5,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 12, 2020",26,"I'm 69 and using Efudex for the second time. Just as in 2008, I have been recommended for 21 days of Efudex cream, 2 applications per day, followed by 21 days of twice a day applications of Desonide 0.05%.I am applying the cream broadly on my forehead back to my receded hairline, my sideburn area and my nose. After the first week most areas turned blotchy red and grew increasingly sore and itchy. I have experienced mild stomach upset and my face feels hot.  It started to effect my ability to sleep around day 16. Almost packed it in on day 19 but read these posts and decided to persevere for 3 more days. It worked very well back in 2008 and I'm looking forward to the ordeal ending and getting similarly good results.",Itchy Dick
6,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,10.0,,"January 31, 2020",64,"Face was covered in about 7 areas after years of sun damage from working in the sun, used Efudex for 15 days applied 2 times a day till the 40mgs tube ran out , week 2 the pain was not nice but honestly go thought it it is worth it ,Like having a face lift looking 10 years younger !!! Believe me it is truth .Using it on my arms now just started For any one going though a course, it really is impressive cream",Snozz
7,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 2, 2020",32,"Have found using efudux apply only every 3 or 4  th day  seems reaction not so bad and it will do the job in same amount of time  ..works for me",Sun burnt  Aussie
8,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,8.0,,"December 20, 2019",40,"I was prescribed this cream to treat BCC on my nose.  I had a red spot with suspected basal cell carcinoma. My dermatologist wanted me to treat my entire nose, to get any spots that hadn't emerged yet.  I put on twice daily for two weeks.  It took about a week for anything to happen, but then the spot turned red.  Soon my entire nose turned pink.  At day 14 my nose was red, with purple areas, blisters, and depressions.  I had to put Vaseline on it to tolerate the pain.  It felt like someone had burned my face with a hot iron. The skin was pulled taught and I was afraid of scarring. It has been 8 weeks after the application stopped.  It is still a little pink.  Unfortunately it did not get my spot, it is not superficial enough.  The cream redness lasts longer for me than I anticipated.   It was an 8 week process for me and still have a pink nose. hope it isn't permanent.",Rudolf
9,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 10, 2019",75,"I've had surgery for basal cell over the years and had an area near my nose. I used efudex as directed. Sure, it looked horrible after treatment it was a bit lumpy like it was scarred. I thought it didn't work. The area, came back totally cancer free and the lumpy look went away. You would never know it was treated. Well worth it. I'm currently using it on my cheek and hoping for the same result. ",Dans62
10,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 31, 2018",34,"Just got done using this for a superficial Basal Cell on my nose.  Week 1 wasn't bad, just a little redness and irritation at the end.  By the end of week 2, it was red and very itchy.  I can't say it was ever very ""painful"", just uncomfortable and irritated.  It has felt like something crawling across my face/nose since end of week 2, and itchy.  Lots of trouble getting to sleep because of this.  2 weeks once a day, 3 weeks twice a day.  It's still red and very itchy and I'm told will be for another week or two.  Now I wait for follow-up.",RedNose
11,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 20, 2016",42,"I have basil carcinoma of my face cheeks and face had lumps. I have Scottish skin. Started Efidux treatment and after day 3 I became violently ill. For 10 days I couldn't hold any food down what ever. Both exit body points were hammered with oozing duck poo like stuff I have never experienced before. Bloated stomach, gas build up and always on the toilet. After day 10 the systems eased and I started to hold some food down. Currently on day 16 of treatment an day face looks like an iron has been applied to both FACE CHEEKS. Very painful and still feel unwell. This better work because I have researched this product before commencing and there were no side affects listed like I have had. Met another patient of efidex with similar side effects.",Rackoon.
12,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 30, 2016",30,I have BCC on my upper arm and SCC on upper left hand. Unfortunately after 6wks of treatment twice a day the cream didnt work. So disappointed and im now scheduled to have both surgically removed.,Smand
13,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 21, 2016",36,"I had a small lump removed from below my lip, and was prescribed efudex to be applied twice a day for four weeks. I have just finished that time, so I don't know how effective it has been. I had no reaction for 9 days, then my lip became very swollen and weepy, cracked in the corner. My GP suggested that I put vaseline around the spot before applying the cream, and that helped the lips considerably.  I changed to paw-paw cream, which seemed to help. Now it is six days since I stopped applying the cream and I still have what looks like a large cold sore, as well as the red crustiness under my nose which started only when I stopped the efudex. I am hoping this may go soon. I am not sure whether to put anything on them or not.",Jojill
14,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,10.0,,"May 2, 2016",110,"This is my third time over the past 10 years doing this treatment.  I'm scheduled for 4-6 weeks treating my legs, stomach and chest areas.  I like that the medication seeks out and treats damaged skin only.  My stomach has only 3 small spots.  However my legs and chest area that have been far more exposed to sun have a much more aggressive reaction. The pain, redness, swelling and sores are extremely painful however my history reminds me that in 3-4 weeks I will be finished and my skin will look and be much better.  Skin cancer gone and baby smooth new skin. It's affordable, and a more complete overall treatment that definitely works.  Stick with the plan you don't be disappointed !!",Caroline B
15,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 27, 2015",30,"I am just about to start treatment  for superficial BCC on my hands, feet legs and nose, obviously from all I have read , I am going to do it in stages.I am having to plan this around a conference, my children's exams and prom dance!! I know that it is going to get really painful. Has anyone done their hands or feet or both at the same time? I am doing a test patch on my arms at the moment to see how skin reacts - on the advice of my docSome guidance would be much appreciated",Caryn pen
16,Efudex,Basal Cell Carcinoma,10.0,,"January 3, 2015",140,This is my second time around. I am on Day 10 of a 14-day regime; then steroid cream for another 14 days. I am in excuciating pain and I look horrific. I know it's a good thing but it is so painful. I wanted to write here to help encourage others; I found this site because I needed encouragement. I use a dish towel with fringe to flap against my face and that's the only relief I get. I forget how awful I look until I catch myself in a mirror.,LTOV
