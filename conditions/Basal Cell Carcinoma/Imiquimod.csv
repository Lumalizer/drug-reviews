1,Imiquimod,Basal Cell Carcinoma,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 27, 2021",0,"Aldara (imiquimod):I have had several BCC's surgically removed, including one on my chest which caused keloid scarring. When another BCC presented next to the excision site on my chest the doctor decided that Aldara cream would be worth trying.  Side effects mentioned were slight flu like symptoms. I was told it works off your immune system and should have done my research at that point. Initially I developed slight flu-like symptoms, enlarged lymph nodes and the site scabbed as was meant to. After two weeks I developed a severe body rash, extreme abdominal pain and felt generally very unwell. The doctor advised to stop usage and obtain steroidal cream for the rash - there was no advice for the other symptoms.  I visited my naturopath who was horrified I'd been prescribed this drug as I had recently had Ross River Fever and was immunocompromised.  The abdominal pain turned out to be leaky gut syndrome and took months to resolve. DO NOT take this drug if your immune system is in ANY way compromised.",Oshikana
2,Imiquimod,Basal Cell Carcinoma,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 29, 2020",17,"I just finished my 2nd 6 week course of imiquimod for BCC on my scalp.  I had had 2 mohs surgeries and the cancer kept coming back in nearby areas.  After seeing multiple doctors,  someone suggested imiquimod as an alternative to major surgery or errivedge.  It seems to be working but it takes time when you finish for the skin to fully heal and a scan or biopsy will need to be done to determine true results.  I did not have any severe adverse effects as others have mentioned.  I used the cream on  a 1 x 2 area and had red sores which itched but otherwise tolerable. My hair did not fall out which was good news.  I have superficial as well as nodule bcc.    IF you can tolerate this cream it is well worth a try before going the surgery route.  It took months for any doctor to suggest it to me.  Most people have good reactions to this cream if you read the studies that are online. Good luck.",Neo

Never once have I been able to go the full course as my glands swell and I feel miserable and fluey.  Over the years, I have had 21 MOH's surgeries, so I always think the Aldara will be better, but after this last round, I'm not so sure.                                This time, the dermatologist told me to apply it to my whole face Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights and rinse off in the morning.  There are at least 30 lesions that are reacting and yesterday I had to just lay in a chair all day, feeling awful.  Needless to say, I'm going off of it a bit early again.  Hopefully it has done something to most of these areas, but I'm not sure I'm a good candidate for this drug.  The good thing about MOH's surgery is that the entire BCC is removed and doesn't come back.  Many of these spots are ones that I've used Aldara on over the years and they are back...",Zanzibar

You MUST wash hands before and after applying and you MUST wash the application area(s) after 8 hours.  I applied the cream on the tip of my nose but the entire nose reacted!  I applied the cream Monday to Friday and took Saturday and Sunday off.  Weeks 3 and 4 were the worst....lots of oozing and dark scabs.  You can use makeup....start with a color corrector, then a concealer and/or foundation.  I’m now waiting for the scabs and redness to go away.

It was swollen and I had such pain i could not even hold a pen.  Of course it had to be my right thumb, and I am right handed.  which is also the hand I applied the cream with.  I had a orthopedic friend order an xray, which came back as arthritis in those areas.  One of the rare side effects,  however I also had fever chills malaise, and really ugly inflammation.  I have since had to have several lesions surgically removed, involving skin grafts, some removed with the use of liquid nitrogen, and now my dermatologist is recommending I treat them again with Aldara.

I insist on a biopsy the minute I have even a tiny, non-healing lesion and I have never been wrong. I notice nothing for about 14 days, then all the big reaction breaks loose! Painful, weeping, 2-cm sores requiring gauze just to sleep. I look like a leper. This latest treatment came with massive headaches, joint aches, abdominal pain and flu-like malaise which began during week three and continues unabated. That said, I have never had a lesion recur; there is no scarring whatsoever; and the healing after stopping the applications is swift-- all sores gone within about two weeks. It can take two to four months before the skin thickens completely back to normal, and I am compulsive about sun-screening-- especially any pre-treated areas. The treatment isn't fun, and at $400 a pop it's a bit excessive. But the results for me have been consistently great.",Anonymous

Nothing happened for about 10 days, but when it did, wow!  Instead of having one lesion only it turned out that I had them all over my nose. It became swollen, then stretched, then ""crusty"", and then the whole mess disappeared and has not returned, 5 years now.The biggest drawback is the price!  It was on half-prescription when I began, but very shortly thereafter it was taken off prescription (I live in Spain) and reverted to 84 euros. I wouldn't mind except with the little- sachets - you don't seem to be getting much for your money.More recently I have had a similar lesion on my temple. I have been using Diclofenaco partly because it seems to have a good reputation, and partly because it is MUCH cheaper.

This treatment was well worth the pain and discomfort.  Skin is healthy and no surgeries.  Be prepared to be stared at and don’t plan any important business/social event during treatment. It truly is ugly.  But again, 6 weeks of discomfort for exceptional result is worth it to me.   My skin was covered in large oozing scabs that didn’t feel good.  Washing was miserable.

22,Imiquimod,Basal Cell Carcinoma,1.0,,"April 13, 2018",31,Aldara (imiquimod):I had a small dot on my chest and a penny sized one on my side. The dermatology consultant told me to use aldara on the two areas but only once daily for five days then two day break. Leave on for 8 hours then wash off. She then said she would see me in 4 months. I was a bit surprised she didn't want to see me during treatment but thought the aldara must be good at doing its job. How wrong could I be. Within one week of using it the rest of my chest erupted into large red sores with lots of little red spots all over it. I didn't know if this was normal as nothing much was discussed at appointment.  I continued to use the cream but everyday was more and more horrific. The sores were blistering and bleeding and oozing fluid not to mention red raw and itchy. By the end of the second week I could not tolerate any more so I stopped using it and tried to contact the dermatology department which wasn't interested unless I had another referral from my doctor.,Lisa

The Dr. indicated that the next step was surgery to remove part of my ear. I gave it another good dose for the full recommended term with Aldara, and it/s been clear since then.

He said that the cream would turn my nose red.  I applied the Aldara cream every night for 6 weeks as directed.  It was absolutely far more than turning my nose red.  Fatigue, headaches, bright red nose that looked as though my nose was one big cold sore.  I went into quarantine for six weeks.  At times I felt I could not continue.  Some how I did.  If wish there were a place to post pictures of my nose during Aldara treatment.  I went back for the MOH's surgery.  It only took two scrapings to remove cancer.

But, thankfully, it's on top of my head so it isn't noticeable. The main side effects for me have been ""tasting"" the creme inside my mouth (yuk). I've also experienced fatigue and sort of a ""blue"" feeling. Since the scab is very raised I try to avoid brushing my hair much. I've cleaned the wound area with cotton, peroxide and alcohol. No stinging or pain. I attribute that to the fact the scab looks and feels like a helmet. But I'm happy my immune system is working well with the creme. And I will take this process over a bald spot at the top of my head. I take comfort in that I am taking part in the process of my healing. I now wear hats religiously in the sun.

Difficult to tell how much the light headed feeling is coming from fatigue. Joints ache. A little weight gain. I’m irritable due to unbearable fatigue. Dreams at night are emotionally overwhelming and vivid.  The effect of alcohol is extremely magnified. I call these my little bottles of hell. That’s how they make me feel.

Initial redness appeared from in about a week, then the cancer sites began to show ulceration. I'm about two months into treatment, and the cancerous and/or keritoses are almost gone. On a side note, I had areas that lit up I didn't recognize as abnormal, but my immune system did. Used this med about three years ago with similar results. Lastly, don't discard the opened pack if you don't use it all. My Doctor said to open it with a tiny nick in the corner and use only what you need and save the rest for the next treatment. As for the return of my lesions, they are in different spots than before. This med will not cure changes before they exist.",Sunworn

The area did burn initially but that has stopped.  Dizziness and flu like synptoms persisted.My face looks terrible but my MD did say it would get worse before getting better.  The area is severely scabbed, crusted, red, irritated and looks like a giant size deep scab.  The size of the area is increasing and that is a huge concern.Today my eye lids are swollen and bags of fluid appeared under the eyes.  After 5 of 6 weeks treatment had to discontinue use.
