0,Ertapenem,Intraabdominal Infection,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 3, 2019",4,"I was put on ertapenem for an intestinal infection (Ileum infection due to Crohn’s). Infusion therapy sucks but I have not had any side effects from this drug except maybe some fatigue. Better for me than flagyl, which made me incredibly nauseated and unable to eat. While this drug is powerful, don’t be afraid. Everyone reacts differently to medication but I was told by my infectious disease doctor that this medication was about as well tolerated as amoxicillin. I have more issues with saline solution IV flushes than this.",Cole
