0,Clindamycin,Intraabdominal Infection,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 16, 2017",4,"I started triple therapy of clindimycin, amoxicillin and a PPI 3 days ago for HPylori infection. I've been on a PPI and amoxocillin before with no side effects but not clindamycin. Its a big dose. 500mg twice a day for 7 days.The first 3 doses were awful. Disgusting taste in my mouth and terrible nausea with a gnawing, rumbly feeling in my stomach. After I read some advice on this page I tried drinking more water. Half pint before the dose then after. Plus  a daily probiotic drink. I also didn't lie flat after dosage for an hour.This has made a huge difference. Still a bit of a taste but no nausea and a better sleep. Still 4 days to go but fingers crossed as the hpylori had been causing pain. Def good advice.",Izzy1406
