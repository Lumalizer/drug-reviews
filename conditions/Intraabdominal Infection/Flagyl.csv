0,Flagyl,Intraabdominal Infection,2,,"January 2, 2017",2,"Flagyl was prescribed to me after an appendectomy with a leaking appendix. I took 3 doses at home and the side effects started immediately and became more severe with every subsequent dose. I was dizzy to the point of having to hold on to the wall to walk. I had the worst metallic bad taste in my mouth that actually made everything taste horrible (water, juices, food etc). I was extremely nauseous to the point that I started heaving even with liquids. I had severe diarrhea as well, which I am not sure was related to Flagyl or not, but subsided once I was off that medicine. I was changed to Cypro and have been feeling much, much better with that antibiotic. In my case I will NEVER take Flagyl again, based on the severe reaction I've experienced",Monja-Turtle
1,Flagyl,Intraabdominal Infection,10,,"June 28, 2016",8,"I read all of these reviews on the side effects of this medication. They scared me so bad because I have hurt for 2 weeks, and I didn't want to add more pain on top of that. But the only side effects I have had are tiredness, and a bit of a headache. Only a few days into my 2 week dose, but hoping it fixes whatever problem I have been having with my intestines! Don't be afraid to take it like I was.",Kathleen85
