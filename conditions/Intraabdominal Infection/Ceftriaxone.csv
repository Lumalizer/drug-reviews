0,Ceftriaxone,Intraabdominal Infection,10,,"March 23, 2011",14,"Rocephin (ceftriaxone):I was placed on a 30-day course of Rocephin via I.V. infusion (PICC line) by my infectious diseases doctor to handle a persistent, recurring and resistant strain of E coli that had caused a very serious intestinal infection.  The infection caused perforation and led to an emergency ileocecectomy, partial colectomy and resection of my sigmoid colon.Taking the Rocephin was easy - it came in small pre-pressurized ""bulbs"" that I attached to the PICC line once a day and then carried around with me in a pocket for 30-40 minutes while it administered the proper dosage.Rocephin worked wonderfully for me, with zero side effects. My white blood cell count fell back to normal levels within a week of starting the treatment, and I have been infection-free now for more than 90 days.",Innovator2020
