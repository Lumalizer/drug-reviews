1,Ciprofloxacin,Intraabdominal Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 20, 2018",3,"I took one 500 mg pill and after 2 hours had tingling and stabbing pain in my Achilles tendon, pain down my shin and into my foot. I immediately took magnesium to try to stop the effectiveness of the meds. Was prescribed this with metronidazole  because of GI issues but lab results haven't even come back. This should only be given as a last ditch effort.",Ladybug
