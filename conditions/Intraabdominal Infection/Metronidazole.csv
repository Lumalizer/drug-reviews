0,Metronidazole,Intraabdominal Infection,2,,"August 2, 2018",1,"I was having stomach aches and diarrhea from a parasite infection. My doctor prescribed flagyl metronidazole 3x per day for 10 days. I’m on my 7 th day and I feel horrible. I have a constant dull headache behind my eye area. I feel very tired, and weak throughout the day. If I move my head too fast I feel super dizzy. I have to pee more frequently. My stomach aches haven't gone since starting this medication but I can’t tell if my infection has gone yet because my stool doesn’t look normal yet. I’ve never experienced side effects like this before , and didn’t think it was due to the medication. Thankfully I came across this thread and now know what’s been causing me to feel so down.",Dii
1,Metronidazole,Intraabdominal Infection,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 20, 2017",0,"I took this for 12 days after developing an abdominal infection after emergency bowel surgery. It  was IV while in the hospital for 5 days and then orally 400mg 3 times a day. I don't know if it was responsible for the way I felt whilst in it (was also on co-amoxyclav)  but I felt horrendous. I had the most awful dizzy, light-hearted headed, spaced out sensations for the entire time. I had a couple of times where I felt so bad I thought I was about to die. I have never experienced anything like that before but I thought I was having a major stroke. The sensation in my head and body was how I imagine a stroke would feel. I then, as a result, had my BP shoot up to 180/110 and pulse go above 100. Really terrifying! Got rid of infection though.",HippyG
2,Metronidazole,Intraabdominal Infection,2,,"January 2, 2017",2,"Flagyl (metronidazole):Flagyl was prescribed to me after an appendectomy with a leaking appendix. I took 3 doses at home and the side effects started immediately and became more severe with every subsequent dose. I was dizzy to the point of having to hold on to the wall to walk. I had the worst metallic bad taste in my mouth that actually made everything taste horrible (water, juices, food etc). I was extremely nauseous to the point that I started heaving even with liquids. I had severe diarrhea as well, which I am not sure was related to Flagyl or not, but subsided once I was off that medicine. I was changed to Cypro and have been feeling much, much better with that antibiotic. In my case I will NEVER take Flagyl again, based on the severe reaction I've experienced",Monja-Turtle
3,Metronidazole,Intraabdominal Infection,10,,"June 28, 2016",8,"Flagyl (metronidazole):I read all of these reviews on the side effects of this medication. They scared me so bad because I have hurt for 2 weeks, and I didn't want to add more pain on top of that. But the only side effects I have had are tiredness, and a bit of a headache. Only a few days into my 2 week dose, but hoping it fixes whatever problem I have been having with my intestines! Don't be afraid to take it like I was.",Kathleen85
4,Metronidazole,Intraabdominal Infection,10,,"October 12, 2015",1,"I'm 14 years old, and 2 weeks ago, the very next  Day of my homecoming I started feeling sick with pain on my right side of my stomach so the next day I go to the doctor and I get an ultrasound but they can't find my appendix. So two days later I have fever and diarrhea so I go to the hospital. In the hospital they do a CT scan which made my whole body feel warm.  They then tell me that I have appendicitis and they insert many antibiotics in my IV & tell me  that they are going to have to drain the pus from the appendicitis by inserting a tube inside of my stomach. So when they started treating me with antibiotics to make some of the infection to go away they see a lot of improvement so they decide that they are not going to be draining.",Stephanie Lopez Martinez
