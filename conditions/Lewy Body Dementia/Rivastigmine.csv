0,Rivastigmine,Lewy Body Dementia,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 11, 2021",1,"My doctor in Latin American recommended Rivastigmine Transdermal System, 4.6 mg/24 hours. I had a slight headache on the first day, nothing on the second day. I feel more alert and have a positive disposition. After 2 months of daily use, I have not felt depressed. My daughters say that my mood has changed, that I do not get upset as easily, and seem to have more energy. The cost of the medicine in Latin America was about $30.00 for a three-month supply. In NJ, with insurance, about $195.00. The price difference is difficult to understand.",Lolita
