0,Oxybutynin,Dysuria,9,,"December 13, 2021",1,"I first was described Elmiron. Immediately, my vision became blurry & made me sick @ my stomach, plus it didn’t work for my Dysuria. Within the 1st month I told my dr & he changed me to Oxybutynin. It started working immediately. I still @ times have UTI spasms when I pee, but overall I’m very satisfied with it. It does help with my bladder pain, controlling the infection that is in the lining of my bladder. But, my eyesight has never cleared back up.",Mrs Bare

3,Oxybutynin,Dysuria,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 27, 2019",24,"Ditropan (oxybutynin):This drug ruined my life.  I was on a  five day course of 15 mg. An hour later after taking this medication, I experienced an unusual taste in the mouth (metallic/bitter), foods tasted distorted, (phantageusia) and now my tongue burns. I stopped taking the medication right after these side effects and here I am now with lingering side effects since April 2018.  These doctors never go into the side effects in depth but only the common side effects.  After telling my doctor about thus side effect, he acted like I was crazy.  Never thought something like this could happen",Shay

5,Oxybutynin,Dysuria,9,,"February 17, 2010",22,I'm 22 years old and I used this drug after a ureteroscopy for a large kidney stone.  I had a stent in place for 6 weeks and found that this drug worked miracles for me.  It relieved pain in the both the bladder and kidney and helped urination become far less painful.  A side effect was that it made me slightly lethargic and tired - but that beats the pain any day.,Anonymous
