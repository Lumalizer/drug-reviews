1,Ditropan,Dysuria,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 27, 2019",24,"This drug ruined my life.  I was on a  five day course of 15 mg. An hour later after taking this medication, I experienced an unusual taste in the mouth (metallic/bitter), foods tasted distorted, (phantageusia) and now my tongue burns. I stopped taking the medication right after these side effects and here I am now with lingering side effects since April 2018.  These doctors never go into the side effects in depth but only the common side effects.  After telling my doctor about thus side effect, he acted like I was crazy.  Never thought something like this could happen",Shay
