0,Pyridium,Dysuria,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 7, 2022",3,"I’ve been having frequent UTI'S and at it’s worst I will have hematuria (blood in urine), intense bladder cramps, and insane burning. When it gets like this, nothing brings relief as it’s just constant pain and burning in all positions. Frequent urination but the blood makes it so intense. Pyridium has been my saving grace with it. I always take it with food. I took it once without and did get dizzy. It completely calms down my bladder and takes away the burning. Makes me feel like I don’t even have an UTI. I don’t notice any side effects with it which is odd as I usually am sensitive to medications. It does make your pee bright orange and super duper quickly. I’ve never stained anything with it though. It also makes the peeing frequent stop.",Meganmuffin
1,Pyridium,Dysuria,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 4, 2021",0,It only worked minimally for about two days. Not of much use,Anonymous
2,Pyridium,Dysuria,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2021",25,"Ooooooomg! What a MIRACLE! I’ve never had a UTI before and I spent days googling my symptoms and convinced myself I had some sort of endometrial cancer. Don’t do internet searches on symptoms. Ever. I was in bad shape. The urgency was the worst. About an hour after I took it, it felt like something was inside my bladder giving it a big hug. Pain went away, urine stopped leaking, and I felt like myself again after 5 days or torture. Was also put on Macrobid for the infection but it was this stuff that made me feel well again. No bad side affects at all! And I’ll take the orange urine, toilet stains and I just used a panty liner to protect my underwear. Bladder spasms are the worst part of a UTI and this was my first so I was convinced I had something terminal lol. I would love to give the investor of this amazing drug a huge hug! Oh and it was like $3.",AJ
3,Pyridium,Dysuria,5,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 24, 2020",5,"Maybe is good but, in my case I had so much urgency that became sometimes incontinent. The carpet and the clothes stains can not be taken out. Now I have to spend a lot of money changing the carpet",IKE
4,Pyridium,Dysuria,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 15, 2019",15,"Was in so much pain and the need to urinate was SO strong for hours. Took pyridium and like 1.5 hours later I felt WORLDS better! I would have given it a 10 if it worked a bit faster, but seriously, I was miserable and it helped so much!",CJ
5,Pyridium,Dysuria,10,,"May 12, 2019",6,LOVE Pyridium!   Nothing else works as well. It is a miracle drug.  My kidney was in spasms intense pain from the stones and infection.  This product worked like a wonder drug on the pain while the antibiotic did its work.,BJ
6,Pyridium,Dysuria,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 26, 2018",10,"I recently took pyridium for the first time and for me it’s a miracle drug! I recently suffered my first full blown UTI and it was extremely painful and uncomfortable. After one dose of pyridium, my symptoms have completely disappeared and I feel back to normal. I am also on an antibiotic to clear up the infection. It took about 3 hours to really start working but 14 hours later the relief is still there. And it’s cheap at the pharmacy.  I would recommend anyone give it a try! My pain and urgency are gone and I’m so happy!",kendall
7,Pyridium,Dysuria,1,,"February 3, 2018",17,"Many years ago I was prescribed Pyridium for UTI. I took one tablet. What I experienced was not a allergic reaction.  I am a nurse and honestly the only way I can describe what happened is ‘every cell in my entire body wanted Pyridium OUT!’  Like Kryptonite to Superman, I honestly believe if I ever took it again I would die.   It was the worst thing I have ever experienced. Even handling Pyridium makes me nervous.  It has been over 25 years ago.",Me23255
8,Pyridium,Dysuria,1,,"October 13, 2016",17,"I've been having UTIs for 7 years, my most recent one has lasted 24 days so far. Because of this I went to the doctor and they prescribed me pyridium twice a day. I was very hopeful but unfortunately it didn't work. The burning while urinating is still there and I've been on it for three days so far. Also discomfort all hours of the day down there. It may work well for others but my body doesn't accept it, it did nothing. Going to the doctor was useless, go straight to the urologist",Efgigjdkd
9,Pyridium,Dysuria,1,,"August 18, 2016",20,"I'm a man with UTI which is much less common than in women.  My Dr. tells me that my case is fairly bad and seems surprised that I didn't complain more about the considerable pain while urinating.  He prescribed antibiotics to heal the infection and this drug to help with pain and urgent feeling of needing to go.  I experienced gut wrenching nearly vomit inducing pain while urinating on this medicine while prior to dosage I was experiencing discomfort to start urine flow but manageable pain that subsided when ending urination.  The primary difference with this medication seemed to  be more severe pain and less ability to stop it than before I was using the drug.  I'll NEVER take another dosage again.  Really, really rough for me.",JimCMaleUTI
10,Pyridium,Dysuria,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 9, 2016",17,"I have ureter stents due to malignant pelvic tumors.  I had burning pain at the end of my stream but after a few days on Cipro with no relief, a UTI was ruled out.  My urologist put me on Pyridium and I felt better within hours.  No side effects except that orange urine!",Jeaniebaby
11,Pyridium,Dysuria,8,,"February 9, 2016",10,"As everyone knows kidney stones are very painful and very uncomfortable. My doctor prescribed me this medication to help to ease the pain. And it seriously works. I do not like taking pain medication, so I was pleased when I took this and it actually worked.",alex12574477
12,Pyridium,Dysuria,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 19, 2015",4,"Did some, not enough, to relieve pain.  I have pain because I have a ureter stent and am receiving radiation treatments to the pelvis -- both irritate the bladder and urinary track.  I am searching for a similar drug to this.  There must be something similar to this drug that helps alleviate the pain.",CJ12354321
13,Pyridium,Dysuria,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 25, 2013",56,"It has helped a lot. Does turn my urine a neon orange. I had taken it before now about 3 years ago without any other side effects besides neon Orange urine, but this time my vision went very blurry, very quickly and scared me a lot. Then I started reading other people's reviews on it and now I understand its normal and nothing for me to freak out over. This is a great medicine either way.",CaMaJa
14,Pyridium,Dysuria,9,,"August 30, 2013",40,"Took this for pain relief for a urinary tract infection - took about an hour and a half to kick in for my first pill but after that I took it every 4 1/2 hrs because I had bad pressure and burning that kept coming back. Usually I have no symptoms on this but more recently when I took it I have had nausea, blurred vision, really bad sweats. But nothing serious that would make me stop taking the pill.",winniepin88
15,Pyridium,Dysuria,9,,"August 29, 2013",38,"I took Pyridium for my urinary tract infection. I have taken this medication many times and it works WONDERS. Takes away that uncomfy pressure and burning sensation. When I take it, it takes about 45 - 1 hr to kick in initially and then depending how bad my urinary tract infection is I take it every 4 hours. Usually I get no symptoms however this time taking it I do, I have gotten blurred vision, bad drowsiness, cold sweats and hot flashes, BUT they are all manageable!",Winnie Pin

17,Pyridium,Dysuria,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 9, 2013",32,"I have interstitial cystitis and also just finished a Z Pack for a sinus infection.  I got a yeast infection and was in desperate pain, extreme burning , swelling etc. I took a 200mg Pyridium pill and cut in half, as I remember how nauseated it had formerly made me. I weigh 110lbs and I am sensitive to most medicines, so I like to start smaller. I suggest you take it with food as it says that it doesn't interfere with the affect it has.  Will make your urine bright orange, so watch your white clothes.",beenthere123

19,Pyridium,Dysuria,10,,"February 8, 2012",37,This is a magical medicine! Had a very bad bladder infection and couldn't get out of the bathroom! After 2 doses I had COMPLETE relief!
