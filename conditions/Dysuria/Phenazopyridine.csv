0,Phenazopyridine,Dysuria,10.0,,"March 22, 2022",0,Best TEMPORARY quick PAIN relief till u can get to Dr for ANTIBIOTICS.I repeat; It does NOT CURE INFECTION.Only pain & SYMPTOM relief. You still have an infection.Only TAKE 2 DAYS as directed. Go to Dr or walk in clinic. See a UROLOGIST if you have more than 2 infections per year NOTE: ALL medications are NOT good for your GUT MICROBIOME…Plus 70% of your HORMONES from gut influence your body & brain.Take as MUCH as necessary & as LITTLE as possible! especially ANTIBIOTICS as they effect the good & bad microbes in your gut & can take up to months to a year to repopulate to NORMAL…,CSR
1,Phenazopyridine,Dysuria,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 7, 2022",3,"Pyridium (phenazopyridine):I’ve been having frequent UTI'S and at it’s worst I will have hematuria (blood in urine), intense bladder cramps, and insane burning. When it gets like this, nothing brings relief as it’s just constant pain and burning in all positions. Frequent urination but the blood makes it so intense. Pyridium has been my saving grace with it. I always take it with food. I took it once without and did get dizzy. It completely calms down my bladder and takes away the burning. Makes me feel like I don’t even have an UTI. I don’t notice any side effects with it which is odd as I usually am sensitive to medications. It does make your pee bright orange and super duper quickly. I’ve never stained anything with it though. It also makes the peeing frequent stop.",Meganmuffin

I’ve never had a UTI before and I spent days googling my symptoms and convinced myself I had some sort of endometrial cancer. Don’t do internet searches on symptoms. Ever. I was in bad shape. The urgency was the worst. About an hour after I took it, it felt like something was inside my bladder giving it a big hug. Pain went away, urine stopped leaking, and I felt like myself again after 5 days or torture. Was also put on Macrobid for the infection but it was this stuff that made me feel well again. No bad side affects at all! And I’ll take the orange urine, toilet stains and I just used a panty liner to protect my underwear. Bladder spasms are the worst part of a UTI and this was my first so I was convinced I had something terminal lol. I would love to give the investor of this amazing drug a huge hug!

I was a bit disappointed that Uricalm also causes nausea, because that was my main gripe with AZO. It's not pleasant when you wake up at 5am with the onset pain of a UTI. You just don't have the patience to wait to take the tablets until you have made a meal for yourself and danced around the kitchen trying to eat. But this must be a side effect of all urinary analgesics. I think it takes the same amount of time for the relief to take effect as AZO. Don't let the relief of feeling better lull you into a false belief that your UTI is gone. Go to your doctor for antibiotics, because these tablets only treat the symptoms and will NOT cure UTIs.",Brandy

Once you take them they last all day and eliminate any pain including while you’re peeing. Yes they do make you lower back a little sensitive but it’s worth the relief this medicine brings.

It helped a lot with the urinating burning pain after having the mid urethral sling surgery and after having a catheter in place for a week.  I noticed leg cramps started towards the third week and have continued very bad every night ever since even after stopping the medicine.  The cramps and spasms are so painful and I had to get up and walk around to stretch out the muscles to relieve.  My doctor said to try drinking Tonic water with Quinine which I have been every day now and it has helped a lot!  You can also try Hylands natural pills for leg cramps.  These did not seem to do the trick without the Tonic water.  I think it has to do with dehydration because I also felt very thirsty.,1234

I ended up getting surgery to remove the stone after an agonizing 5 weeks of trying to pass it. They put in a urethral stent for 2 weeks and this product saved me. With it I could pee once every 30 min or so. Without it I felt the need nearly constantly. Sometimes I’d even pee, stand up and feel the need to pee again before I could even walk out of the stall   So I mean it that it saved me. I was able to work.",JanisK

I got an at home UTI test strip and sure enough I had it. I got the URICALM at my local CVS store in hopes it would give me some kind of relief. I drank a 12oz of cranberry juice and three water bottles with 2 tablets (in 12 hours) and that night I felt 100% better! I was worried I would have to go to the doctor and get on antibiotics but with URICALM that wasn't the case! Very affordable. It comes in a 60 pack and it only took 2 to help me!
