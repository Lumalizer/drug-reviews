I get a great, deep, restful sleep better than I’ve ever had on my own. Without supplements I wake up every hour or two throughout the night often with periods of not being able to fall back asleep.  After taking one two tablet dose I’m able to stay asleep the majority of the night, only getting up once or so to use the bathroom.

Now the second point they make is much more advisable where you take one probably around  I would say 6pm as it gives your body much more time to acclimatize to the product.  For me I only took one just before I went to bed but it's much more a delayed reaction so I found that I was quite groggy the next day (mistake).
