0,Trazodone,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 1, 2022",0,"I have taken Trazadone for 20 years. I was diagnosed with ADD in my 40's now 72 and have always sleep well. I would stay up until I was tired enough to go to sleep. I have taken some form of amphetamine for my ADD which also made it hard to sleep. So about 20 years ago the person I was going to for med checks recommended Trazadone 50 MG and the rest is history. I have never had side effects. Did I say that I have sleep apnea and have used a Cpap machine for 25+ years. The doctor I go to once a year check and make sure that my sleep apnea is in check that I should take the Trazadone an hour or so before I go to bed because I fatigued right after I ate breakfast. My post breakfast fatigue didn't improve so I'm cutting back on my sugar and this seems to help. After all I'm type II diabetes, 50 lbs over weight, don't exercise and old. So I'm trying to walk every day, lower my sugar intake and improve my diet. Trazadone is not the culprit for my post breakfast fatigue. Trazadone works!",cab485

I woke up feeling insanely hungover, was nauseous, lost my coordination and my head was pounding. Around 12 pm I started getting delirious and had to leave my class. Took pain medication, slept for 4 hours, spent the rest of the day with the blinds down and the pain has gone down to a strong headache but i still can’t really study or move normally. I just hope it’s going to be gone when I wake up tomorrow. I won’t be taking this again my worst hangovers felt better than this. Didn’t really help with sleep either :’)",whendoesitend

3,Trazodone,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 28, 2022",0,"Perfect pill for sleeping with a worrisome side effect. I cannot sleep with out serious sleeping medicine, this pill from a little less than 50mg up to 100mg I guess makes me feel good and tired, puts me to sleep and keeps me asleep AND for the right amount of hours, it saved my life and my work life. I’m seriously worried about the side effect, I know me and my body aren’t like anyone else’s so it may just be me but the pill makes me, particularly my arms, super weak, it consumes my strength leaving me with about 10-15% strength through the night especially the longer I’ve been sleeping, it’s so hard to squeeze my fist together with any amount of pressure beyond my fingers just touching my palms, and pulling the covers up is so hard and requires so much effort, the weakness I feel/lack of strength is very much there and every time I take it too. So I’m worried about long term permanent damage of being stuck weak one day like an old man and I’m only 27.",Sulegoluch

It worked great at helping me fall asleep quicker than normal and staying asleep until my alarm. The past month or so has not been the case and I’ve even up’d using the full 50mg tablet! I only get about 3 hours of sleep before waking around 11pm-12am and not being able to fall back asleep even though I’m extremely tired!

8,Trazodone,Insomnia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 16, 2021",2,"Freia33 whose review is a couple below this one, is blaming this drug for a whole host of problems for which there is zero scientific evidence that trazodone is to blame. Just apply your own common sense before dismissing a medication based on this kind of review. The worst side effect I had from trazodone was a stuffy nose intermittently when I took it. The restorative sleep I was able to get far, far outweighed this minor annoyance. It did make me a bit groggy in the morning but I adjusted to that after a couple of weeks. One of the most benign drugs I’ve taken.",Atticus
9,Trazodone,Insomnia,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 11, 2021",0,"My neurologist prescribed Trazodone for insomnia and depression, which she believed would help with my chronic migraines. I started taking it on 12/1 (currently it’s 12/10. I am on the lowest dose (25 mg) and was going to slowly increase to 100 mg, but my neurologist decided it would be better to keep me on 25 after reviewing my side effects.First night I took it, I was fine for about 15-20 minutes. Then my anxiety ramped up. I was spaced out and dissociated. Couldn’t focus on anything, or speak/think coherently. I had several panic attacks brought on by this. My anxiety subsided in about two hours (took the meds at 10) when I became too exhausted to panic. Passed out at 1, slept for 8 hours straight.Since then it’s gotten worse.

I had the worst insomnia ever for about 2 years and finally, at the suggestion of a friend, requested this from my PCP.  It did take a while at first and had to play around with other things like Cortisol blockers, like Seriphos, but I finally achieved relief.  I now sleep most nights with this plus .3mcg of melatonin. On my worst nights I still need to add about .25 of xanax with it, but it has given me for the most, part 6 out of 7 nights a week of decent sleep (6+ hours).  I also feel more elevated in mood since I started taking it which is always a plus, but that could also be because I am finally getting the rest i needed.

I started out with 50 mg and went up to a 125mg didn't see a difference went back down to a 100mg and it only worked some nights so I was disappointed. Then I read where if you want to get to sleep take it 2 hours prior not 30 minutes. I needed to get to sleep  and stay asleep but I started to take it 2 hours prior to sleep along with 2 level teaspoons of Calm and one tsp of glycine and and now I am getting to sleep every night!!

So basically what I can tell you is for mild to moderate insomnia nights, this drug will knock you out in a couple of hours tops but ONLY if you take it IMMEDIATELY BEFORE laying down for sleep. If you take it and then stay up and about it seems to lose its sedative effect. For sometimes moderate and always high insomnia nights (which for me can mean being awake for 36+ hours straight) this med does nothing. What I will say it does seem to do well is I also suffer from panic and depression immediately upon waking up. This medication seems to have eased that a bit. 5 points for sleep (not good, not bad)1 point for helping my morning panics (a pleasant unexpected effect)6 out of 10 overall",MetalMastodonASD

However one night I forgot to take it and I had a panic attack in the middle of the night. So it definitely works at least a bit!

17,Trazodone,Insomnia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 11, 2021",2,"I experienced insomnia because of bad anxiety recently. I started taking cipralex for my anxiety, the anxiety got better but the insomnia got worse. My doctor prescribed 25-50 mg trazadone as needed but that wasn’t enough for me. First few nights it took me hours to fall asleep. I would take 50 mg, wait 2 hours and then take another 50mg and finally fall asleep. That went on for 4 nights before my doctor said I should just take the 100 mg right away and that worked well. I’m still waking up about 4 hrs after falling asleep and then I take another 25 mg and I’m out till morning with not too much drowsiness. I did have dry mouth, dizziness and stuffed nose the first night but nothing after that. I do have vivid dreams but I’ve always had them so it’s nothing new or scary for me.

18,Trazodone,Insomnia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 4, 2021",2,"Trazodone 50mg was the first prescription my doctor put me on for persistent insomnia after OTC meds stopped working for me. For the first couple nights, I had nightmares, but after that trial period, I had no side effects. Got to sleep and stayed asleep all night. It worked like a charm for years. Unfortunately, I subtly and slowly gained 40lbs over the course of 2 years taking Trazodone. I am now on Seroquel as my insomnia got more aggressive and the Trazodone stopped working. No weight gain on Seroquel as of 2 years, and I was able to shed all the weight Trazodone put on me. I recommend Trazodone as a good starting medication for treating insomnia. If it is too weak for you, as it became for me, I would recommend asking your doctor/psychiatrist about Seroquel. Be careful though, Seroquel is A LOT stronger than Trazodone. If you can stay with Trazodone, I would say it’s the better option, even considering potential weight gain, as it is not as powerful and overwhelming as Seroquel.",lazlodjarin
19,Trazodone,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2021",3,"I took 5 50 mg pills total over a few days, back in late august, 2021. A half pill the first two nights, then a whole pill, then 1 1/2 pills two nights in a row. On the first night, 15 minute after taking it felt like fire running up my neck and head, but 30 minutes later I was drowsy and went to sleep for a few hours. The next night, a half pill dose didn't do much. I upped the dose as recommended by my doctor and got restless and panicky. The same thing happened the next night so I decided to discontinue. Now I have a restless feeling and trouble relaxing and sitting down. After a minute I get a feeling of restless agitation and stand up, that has persisted for two months so far. I didn't make the correlation between that and the medicine, but after I looked it up, I seen it was uncommon side effect, and think it may have caused or contributed to that effect. I also have new anxiety, panic attacks, and depression now. I would advise to avoid this med under all circumstances! Also other side effects!",Anonymous
20,Trazodone,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 29, 2021",1,"For context I'm 19 years old. This drug SAVED my  LIFE! After I got my wisdom teeth removed in February 2021, my sleep had been destroyed.  Everyday, I'd be unable to sleep, at most around 1-3 hours. I'd close my eyes, and I'd just like stay awake like that. It was the worst experience if I'm being honest. It was worse than the actual recovery (swelling, bleeding, etc). Prior to surgery I slept 8-10 hours a day. I had enough, I went to my doctor, received Trazodone (first choice of treatment). I started on 50mg for two weeks. I was really scared to take a sleep drug, I never took anything before to sleep so I didn't know what to expect. But I slept for 6 hours, and I woke up feeling refreshed. After a week I started to get intense night sweats that go away after 1-4 minutes. Sometimes I'd wake up middle of the night but I can fall back asleep. Was on it for 3 months total.

I tried different kinds of  medications that did not help. Trazodone is the one that helps me to sleep. Although I was prescribed one whole 50 mg. pill every night. I only take 1/3 of it because the higher dose made me forgetful and disoriented. With this dosage, I can sleep well. So, if you think that 1/2 or 1/3 of the pill works for you as in my case, I am petite and has sensitivity to some medication, it is worth a try as it helps.",tessd

Trazadone us helping with that and my sleep quality is better too.It also helps me with a mild anxiety (although my doctor did not prescribe it for anxiety).

The next night I did not experience any aid in getting to sleep when taken 30 minutes prior to bed. I moved the dosing to 2 hours before bed after that and it did regain its effectiveness, however I woke up many times early the next morning. Some mornings after dosing I experience extreme fatigue and some mornings I don't. It can take longer to feel fully awake while on trazodone. I was then prescribed 100mg nightly so I could take it 30 minutes before bed again and to not wake up multiple times too early. 100mg seems to work best for me.

I was always able to fall asleep with no problem, but staying asleep was.  I was waking about 4-5 times a night for unknown reasons.  I was really hoping that trazodone would help me stay asleep.  I never took more that 50mg at one time because of the reported side effects at higher doses.  Unfortunately, the drug did not help me stay asleep. But, it did cause a terrible case of dry mouth which woke me up off and on all night to drink water.  I also had some blurry vision problems in the mornings which went away by noon. So, I discontinued the drug. The dry mouth and blurry vision went away immediately.   I am going to give trazodone fair rating because I am certain it works for some people, just not for me.  Good luck to the others who try it.",Martin

I got extremely sleepy so I went straight to bed and lay there trying not to panic about the weird feeling in my chest.  I fell asleep quickly and woke up the next morning feeling very nauseated and sick. I also had diarrhea. It took two days to feel better. Thinking maybe it was just too high of a dosage, I waited 3 days and took 1/2 a tablet. Big mistake. Same stuffy nose, same creepy feeling, but I slept through the night.

Anxiety that left me feeling physically ill, and in pain throughout my entire body. Anxiety that caused my lips to go numb, my hands to cramp up, and my brain to zap. Then came the really dark thoughts... I was so scared! Then, after a mental breakdown my husband took me to the emergency room where I was diagnosed with ""Serotonin Syndrome"".

I went to the doctor and first they tried me on an SSRI. This did not work at all. I had a bad reaction to it and dropped 36 pounds in less than three weeks. So, they took me off and for awhile I was able to manage some fitful sleep with unisom sleep tabs. For light insomnia, I think those pills are awesome, but I was dealing with something a bit more robust. So, I got an appointment with a psychiatrist who put me on Trazodone in June 2018. Since, then I've been doing so much better. I started on 50mg, which only kept me asleep for 5 hours, then 100mg, which was like 5.5 hours.  Then, we upped it to 150mg where I have been for the past 6 months, getting anywhere from 7-9.5 hours of sleep each night. Every once in awhile (once a month or so) my anxiety will ramp up and I'll have a restless night despite the trazodone, but I consider that to be natural. I'm really grateful for this drug.",MichGirl

Unfortunately I slept better only because it was the beginning of my vacation and Trazodone made me way more miserable than before I started taking it. My sleep hasn't improved at all over the period of 2 weeks. The dose of 50mg makes me so dizzy and groggy that I am unable to work or think clearly and I still wake up at 4am and I am unable to fall back to sleep. 25mg seems to have a mildly sedative action, but I get the same from hops without side effects. Talking to people while under effects of this drug feels weird because I get the feeling that they will think I am stoned. Walking feels weird because I'm feeling wobbly. I prefer to have insomnia than to have both insomnia and feel incredibly dull every day.

It was getting to the point where I started getting some bad symptoms due to sleep derogation.  Just 3 days ago I was talking with a friend who is on T. as well. I shared my experience with her and she suggested I take it 2 hours before bed time as I was taking it just before bed. Thinking she was nuts I tried it any way. To my surprise it worked and is getting much better, like in the beginning. I started having reservations about this drug that worked so well for years. So I give this med. a high rating because it works very well for me, when I take it correctly. When and why I stopped taking it as directed I don't know but I am glad to get things back on track.",Anonymous

There were several nights I can remember when it felt like the trazodone wasn't working and I'd be up all night. The positive was it helped on most nights. But just like other prescription drugs, it is habit forming and does cause dependence even though doctors may say otherwise.

I was prescribed this as a doctor recommendation over Ambien (which I love & will return to). My reaction to this drug was bad. I am prone to Panic in reaction to body sensations & trazodone was loaded with them. About 25 min after taking 50mg I began to feel dizzy, off balance, & had a drugged feeling. I became very edgy & worried, got a strange taste in my upper gums, my nasal passages closed up, & I experienced a spinning sensation. I personally did not react well & went to bed with a racing heart. Ironically I fell asleep & slept pretty well. Woke up once & the room was spinning. Felt very hung over the next day.

This is also in response to Wellutrin which I was on for 4 months prior for depression, which I'm sure also didn't help with sleep as it's common for contributing to insomnia.   Trazadone worked well for a couple months but I now find myself getting up to urinate 2-3 times a night without having to urinate much at all after the fact, and hard to get to sleep as the temporary wake up is followed by an inability to calm down the mind.

842,Trazodone,Insomnia,1.0,,"February 12, 2009",74,I was given Trazodone for insomnia after a few other medicines didn't work for me.  My doctor gave me a list of frequent side effects.  Imagine my surprise (and ultimately his) when half an hour after taking the medication I became incontinent.  Fortunately this resolved itself by the following morning but it didn't put me to sleep at all.  I told the doctor about this and he recommended to try one more time because sometimes the side effects clear up with repeated use.  No such luck.  I've been told this is a farely rare occurrence but please keep it in mind.,BriansMom
