1,Lorazepam,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 3, 2022",0,"I was on Lorazepam for at least 10 years for Restless Leg Syndrome and was told it is a dangerous drug.  I stopped cold turkey.  After 4 days I was in very bad shape. Immediately I called my Primary Care Doctor who put me on Clonazepam, Mirtazapine, Ropinirole and Hydroxyzine.  That was the start of many other drugs for sleep, anxiety and I could go on and on.  That was the last 8 months, I went through Hives, Rashes, No SLEEP ETC. I have lost all my body muscle, am down to 106 lbs, loss my hair, my gums are now receding. I am now very depressed and angry, what could be worse than this? My Doctor just gave me Zoloft 6 days ago and I had it had a horrible effect of me, my face was pulsating all night, my mouth was so very dry.  When will this end.  I am 78 and firmly believe they never should have taken me off of Lorazepam.  I was healthy, happy not taking medications except for Lorazepam.  I am miserable and see no end in this except for the Doctors to give me more medication.  I was on 6 MG for a long time.",Sissy

I’ve always been a light sleeper, but the past 8-9 years have been horrid. I am 48 years old . Have been prescribed every drug under the sun. After years of horrible sleep I now have severe anxiety. I have had to go on short term disability 3 times in 5 years. I usually hinged my insomnia and anxiety on work stress. I was assigned a new project that was very high profile and I started not sleeping for days on end. I went to the doctor before things got too bad, I did not want to end up on disability again. He prescribed Ativan. I started taking it, .5-1 mg a night. Soon  I was taking it every night, then after about 6 months it stopped working. I ended up in the hospital for a week, quit my job. Ativan works but you better hope it always does. Now on seroquel, and cannot sleep at all without it. Terrified for my families future as I am so unstable. I have a wife and 3 kids",Down in a hole

I reduced from 1mg to .05 and memory very much improved, and I still sleep 6-7 hours, but keep extra .05s if some night I need extra which isn't often. I would suggest that for 1st timers to start with .05 and it might be all you need.  As far as ""addiction"" goes, I am totally addicted to a good nights sleep.

9,Lorazepam,Insomnia,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 15, 2021",2,"Ativan (lorazepam):Ativan can be a two-edged sword.  I have a prescription for 0.5 mg to be used as needed for anxiety and/or sleep.  It works really well for both.  I just have to be careful not to use it too often (it's tempting) because there are uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms.  I want to have it on hand because when I have a days-long anxiety episode, it's the only thing that helps calm me down.  However, my doctor told me that regular, long-term use of Ativan can increase the risk for Alzheimer's.  Articles I've read on this confirm his warning.  That's a good enough incentive for me to use it sparingly.  7/10 Stars for Ativan due to its helpfulness, but with accompanying risks.",David123456

He prescribed Lorazepam .5mg to be used as needed.  It works great for calming me down but lately I've been using one-half tablet (.25mg) just about every night for when I wake up at 1:30am and can't get back to sleep.  It just works.  One benefit to using it during the night is that it seems to help prevent those days-long bouts with anxiety.  Side-effects seem non-existent except for the 'calm' that I'm left with in the morning.  However, from what I've read, I'm concerned that it will eventually lose its effectiveness.  Not sure what I'll do then.  I rate it at 9 since it has potential for dependency and possible loss of effectiveness with long-term use.",David.25mg

I gained weight and just didn't care what I put in my mouth. Ativan has been a life saver for insomnia or severe panic attack. Though I only take it at night 2mg. Sometimes I skip it. Its main use for me is chronic insomnia and nightmares. It's the only one that helps me sleep soundly. I try not to completely rely on it. I understand if I quit taking it my insomnia may come back due to my stress. If my life was better, I believe it could work short term as well. I highly recommend it as a sleep aid. I would use it just enough to get your natural rhythm of sleep back. It's long acting which makes a dose more effective at continuing to work.",Anna

20,Lorazepam,Insomnia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 2, 2020",12,"I recently went through an experience that triggered my anxiety.  I have always had anxiety, social, load noises, smaller sleeping quarters, etc.  My sleep regimen now consists of taking 15mg of Remeron and 1mg of lorazepam.  I know the lorazepam is very addictive but I tried to go for 4 days without it and my anxiety came back pretty high, so I'm back on it.  I talked to someone else who has bad anxiety and trouble sleeping and they take Xanax at night.  It's really difficult for me to have to take such a powerful drug at night but at this time with all the other stressors in life, the election, Covid I don't have much of a choice.  I hope to find a better way to relax in the upcoming months and slowly taper off of it or switch to a different medication.

This happened 3 times over the next 12 hrs. Never had anything like it in my life & felt very ill.  Saw a sleep Specialist who said that’s addiction & withdrawal.

35,Lorazepam,Insomnia,,,"August 12, 2019",24,"Lorazepam helps 80 % of the time. I say this because if I am extremely anxious it won’t help unless I take more than a usual dose. Zoplicone works even better. Each person has a different experience. I only take half of their smallest dose. Also I limit my usage to 2 times week. What I take every night is seroquel. It is usually used for mental illness( bipolar) but in high dose. In a very small dose many docs recommend it for sleep but unlike the other 2 it is not addictive and you don’t have to increase the dose overtime. If I take half of their lowest dose, I sleep very well 5 or 6 nights a week, but I am finding a half is too much for me and can be quite depressed first thing in the morn.  I am trying a quarter as I am running out of solutions. As mentioned, everyone has a different experience depending on their physical and mental make up.

It wasn't until it was too late I realised there was a pattern...3 to 4 days after each time I stopped.... that's when side effects are at the worst. Then I was screwed, cycled through various alternatives which made things worse and had to start taking Lorazepam daily as I could only sleep for 1 1/2 - 2 1/2 hrs a night by that point.

It really works for insomnia. I take it about 45 minutes before bed and fall asleep and stay asleep. I do not feel groggy in the morning or sleepy during the day. Nothing else has worked for me. I have no side effects from it, that I know of. Talk to your doctor about it if your insomnia hasn't been helped by other medicines/therapies and you need relief.",ktracy26

113,Lorazepam,Insomnia,8.0,,"October 19, 2010",85,Ativan (lorazepam):Ativan is a great medicine and glad my psychiatrist prescribed me 1 mg 2 times a day. Though I use that as well as Klonopin but Ativan gets me to sleep sometimes and Klonopin keeps me asleep. Overall I believe its a God send.,benzodiazepine
114,Lorazepam,Insomnia,9.0,,"December 3, 2009",152,Ativan (lorazepam):I have taken just about every drug known to man and found that Ativan works best. Calms me right down and actually lets me sleep ALL NIGHT !,jroxx
115,Lorazepam,Insomnia,10.0,,"November 4, 2009",69,"I take Lorazepam in the 0.5mg dosage about once a week.  It was originally given to me in the ER when I'd had a fast heart rate due to a bad asthma attack.  It helped me sleep in the hospital.  Then I asked that it be prescribed so I could go on a vacation with husband, who snores.  It puts me to sleep faster than he can really get to snoring, and I sleep through the night.  Even if I get up once during the night I go right back to sleep.  Now I take it about once a week, and it also calms any anxiety related racing thoughts that invade my sleep.  I don't want to take it more than that as I don't want to form a habit with it.  But it is nice to have that assurance that I'll get a  good night's sleep and wake up happy.",Anonymous

117,Lorazepam,Insomnia,6.0,,"June 3, 2009",18,This did nothing for me and my insomnia. It worked great the first 2 days I took it. It's great for stressful situations when you feel like you are going to have a panic attack but for me and insomnia it didn't do anything.,NatalieIsSleepy

I've used several other medicines that work well for a while or leave me with a sleep ""hangover"".  I've been using this medicine for a little over a month and I'm feeling much better, my pain is less and I feel very rested in the morning.  I'm very thankful.",Anonymous
120,Lorazepam,Insomnia,9.0,,"March 1, 2008",256,"Ativan (lorazepam):I find when I have those nights that my brain just can't settle down, either a .5 or 1 mg Ativan will help me relax just enough to get a restful sleep. Usually I feel totally energized and fresh the next morning. This is the only thing I have found in almost 20 years that works. However, I can only use it on my worst nights, as it is addictive. That's the only drawback.",Anonymous
