0,Quetiapine,Insomnia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 29, 2022",0,I've been on Seroquel for about 3 months now. I started at 25mg and quickly had to jump to 50 mg and that is where I will try and stay for a while. I take it at 8pm and it kicks in at 10:30 pm for me. I don't understand how people say it kicks in for them in 30 min but I guess we all have different body chemistry. I suffer from extreme insomnia where I wasn't sleep at all for days. I had been taking ambien on and off and then that quit working. My biggest fear is when this will stop working for me. I do see many reports that people have had success for 5-10 years so I am hoping that will be me in the future. It does take a good 2.5 hrs to kick in for me so make sure you try and remember that if you think it will knock you out immediately. It does not for me.,Anonymous

I woke up today (have I even woken up yet?) and I feel worse than I have ever felt in my life. I woke up at all the same times as usual only this time when I had to get up to go pee it was like being absolutely hammered without any of the fun. Horrible trip. Couldn’t wake up even when I was time to wake. Couldn’t take care of my dogs because I could hardly move. I felt confused, guilty, frightened and upset. Made me feel suicidal. It sparked an argument with my spouse because I said I wouldn’t take it again. I can hardly be around him because I’m so tired it’s made me super emotional and kinda angry that anyone would think giving me something that makes me unable to function would be what I needed when I was already so low. I’ve been against meds from the start but finally wanted to see if it could help me and went in with a hopeful heart. These are not what I need at all.

I started from 6mg per night (1/4 of 25mg pill) to 12.5mg every night. At both doses, I developed tolerance to it's sleep effectiveness in a matter of days (expected since it's acting as an anti-histamine). Even at those low doses, it had persistent negative effects during the day: I did not feel rested in the morning, exacerbated shortness of breath during the whole day, feeling sleepy and weak during the day, low energy and not willing to exercise or walk, severely exacerbated anorgasmia/delayed ejaculation (very hard to reach orgasm even at the low dose 6mg/night).

7,Quetiapine,Insomnia,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 25, 2022",1,"I’ve struggled with insomnia since puberty (over 17 years) and have used a variety of medications. The medication I used for years was no longer working so my physician prescribed Seroquel 100mg for me three months ago. I have found it to be effective at helping me fall and stay a sleep for a couple of hours. Though I rarely awake feeling refreshed I don’t feel the same level of morning fog that other medications yielded. The one significant con I associated with Seroquel is weight gain. I’ve gained 15-20 lbs since I started taking the medication. Numerous studies have shown weight gain to be a common side effect (approx 60%) as the medication is known to stimulate appetite and decrease metabolism. Unlike mirtazapine, there does not appear to be an effective countermeasure.",Tom

I used to be able to sleep like a champ, through college years and into my 20’s but I believe my development of a bipolar 1 diagnosis and anxiety (along with addiction issues) I just stopped sleeping around 29-30 years old, sober or not. I was prescribed 100mg of seroquel at bed time and it’s the only drug that can put me out like that, for 7-10 hours of deep sleep. It’s been 7 years now and I take 300mg at night now, still get the same sleep and I think it helps with my bipolar mania, keeping me a bit more grounded, on a set sleeping schedule and so forth. I have tried Restoril, Ambien, Trazadone, nothing works like seroquel. I will only get 1-3 hours without it.

I was very good at falling asleep until I had a terrible anxiety attack where I developed insomnia and it was this vicious cycle of being utterly miserable.

It wasn’t consistent and for the first month I probably only got about 4 hours per night even with upping the dosage to near 100mg at some points. Eventually I realized I wanted to keep it at 25mg so I started watching YouTube videos about how to deal with insomnia. I am now barely taking any, sometimes even none now.

I have a history of anxiety, depression and insomnia and had been taking an SSRI (for the anxiety/depression) along with Trazodone (for insomnia) for only a few months. The combination was working well until I experienced an episode of mania that led to a psychotic breakdown. I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder by an incompetent psychiatrist and was put on lithium and Seroquel. I only took the lithium for a couple of weeks (and was re-diagnosed by a better psychiatrist with 'unspecified affective disorder'). I kept taking the Seroquel (at a lower dose than originally prescribed - the 300 mg made me feel drunk in an uncomfortable way). 100 mg a night has been working really well for me.

Unlike trazodone and amitriptyline, quetiapine does not make me gain weight.The first couple weeks were rough in figuring the proper dosage adjustment, not to mention side effects of daytime exhaustion and increased depression, but, eventually, the meds settled with my body chemistry and I now have no major side effects. I am on a nightly dose of 100mg, and that seems to work fine. Sometimes I take 50-100mg more if needed.The only personal warning I have is to not try to walk once this medication kicks in.

I’ve never had bad sleeping problems before really but the problem kind of persisted for a few days. Somehow ended up being prescribed this for sleep. One 50mg tablet a night before sleepy time. First off it barely even helps at all. At most I get 3 hours of very poor sleep on this, even if I do everything needed to be tired and get a good nights sleep. I’m going on 3 days of taking this and it’s basically ruined my life (not kidding). The side effects are 100% not worth it, the extremely dry mouth, dizziness, inability to focus on anything and tiredness the following day are pretty bad alone. But when I consider that fact that I’m no longer able to get even 1 hour of sleep at night without it now, and it has caused me to fall into a deep dark hole of depression where all I do everyday is research whether this drug is right for me (which I don’t believe it should be prescribed to anyone for sleep).",Sudden Insomnia

I've gone on and off of it after long periods without too much trouble so it doesn't seem to be addictive.  I've discovered Seroquel is also effective in preventing my migraines.  A low dose (25-50mg at night) is key to avoiding potentially serious side effects with this medication.  One major downside regardless of dose is it's very easy to gain weight.  I'll wake up during the night wanting to eat everything in the house. I circumvent this by exercising and not keeping any junk food laying around.

It did put me out for the night and sometimes made me sleep well into the afternoon. I gained a LOT of weight while taking it, not realizing that it was the cause of my nighttime eating. Also, it was giving me terrible heart rhythms. My heart would race unbelievably, sometimes up to over 250 beats per minute! I figured out it was the seroquel. It landed me in the hospital with very low oxygen levels, and now I am trying to find a replacement for it.

I took Xanax, over the counter antihistamines, downloaded meditation apps, etc. I was literally on the verge of the end of my life until my parents forced me to go to behavioral health hospital. At intake, I was in the worst shape of my life, lost so much weight and looked like a complete paranoid schizophrenic out of his mind. The psychiatrist told me that they were going to give me something to knock me out and I asked what. She said seroquel and I asked what kind of drug is that and she said an antipsychotic.

It did discourage me from taking it regularly. Small doses had strong effects on me, so I started cutting my 25 mg tablets in half. After being on it long term it completely changed my sleeping patterns and mood. Now on my normal dose, I finally sleep through the night, and wake up well rested and motivated. In small doses (10-15mg) its effective in relieving daytime anxiety (as prescribed as well) which benefited my generalized anxiety disorder without benzos.

I've been taking this medication for many months now, and it's really been great.  I wake up refreshed, and I do NOT find a hangover like other sleep meds (Remeron, for instance, was BRUTAL for that).

Here's the short list of things hat's been keeping me awake days at a time.  I have CRPS (2012) ,Degenerative Disk Disease C4 -C7 moderate to severe(2001 since 1.5"" shorter). I suffered a T.B.I.( Subdural Laceration .60"") in 2012. Both rotator cuffs that have been torn several times each both of them have SLAP tears and tendonitis ,arthritis in various places. 8 weeks ago I tore my left R.C. for the 3rd or 4th time this time it came with the SLAP tear too. I've had issues with not being able to sleep because of pain for the past 5 years, starting shortly after CRPS reared it's ugly little head. If you aren't familiar with it just imagine all ten of your toes are broken both feet being beat with a hammer repeatedly accompanied by a little fella with a flamethrower that follows you everywhere you go. This is a 24/7-365,  It made me reconsider my position on voodoo dolls because at times I feel as if I'm being stabbed with an ice pick every 10-15 seconds then after 5-20 pokes it moves to a different joint. Imaginary time over now, on the McGill pain scale it's the highest rated pain 48/50 childbirth is a 36,cancer 32 many others listed too. The only difference is those pains go away or have treatment options. Recently the surgeon general changed the approved therapy from opioid pain medications to No  Approved Therapies simply because nothing works for more than a couple of months then your body gets use to the nerve blockers and any and all types and dosages of pain meds. Some choose to have thier feet amputated knowing there may still be phantom pain but that's much lower on the pain scale.

During the 2hrs there she pulled and tugged on everything that hurts trying to figure out the range of motion and all that. This was 2 Mondays ago from that day until the following Monday I had slept a total of 9.5 hours going a minimum of 48 hrs between 1.5-2.5 hr naps before the pain would wake me the same as if someone had dumped a bucket of bricks on my head. After a week of this I saw my Dr for my monthly visit and explained everything including how I tried shifting my medications around ,changing the times taken and completely stopping 1 of them for 3 days and another for 2 days with no effect what so ever. He gave me a few choices of medication to try and I choose this one because I've never seen a commercial for it on TV. I refuse to take anything that's advertised on TV. The side effects are usually a more severe of what ever you needed to take it for plus another 20 possible side effects, not 4 me No. I didn't get home until after 1pm so I planned to take it the next time I felt like I was completely drained and might be able to sleep I would take the RX then as it was the best shot for it to work. That ended up being 10am the next morning,Tuesday.  I took 1-25mg pill 15 minutes before I laid down and I don't remember my head hitting the pillow. In the past 15 years that has happened maybe 5-8 times. I woke up twice to use the bathroom and take my other meds for pain, less than 5 minutes after getting up to pee I was asleep again. I woke up 5:30 am Wednesday morning and felt more human than I have in the past 5 years. The pain was tolerable enough that I laid there for a couple of more hours. The best sleep I can remember. Since then my shoulder is feeling a little better so it's not making my normally terrible situation worse and since I've learned to deal with it as best as one can I'm getting back to sleeping 3.5 to 4.5 hours every night. I've only needed to take 1/2 of one since the first. My situation is very unique but if spilling my guts about things I hate to talk about helps someone else get the sleep they need then it was worth it.",929rr
