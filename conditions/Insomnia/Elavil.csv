0,Elavil,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 14, 2021",1,"I really wish I could give high praise for this medicine, but unfortunately I can't.  I was prescribed 25 mg to help with sleep and depression.  It worked OK the first night.  The next two nights of taking it I had NO sleep.  It kept me awake.  I wasn't worried about anything and no other side effects other than tossing and turning hoping to get some sleep.  Even the night after I stopped taking it I had absolutely no sleep.  Thankfully today is my day off.  I'm hoping it's out of my system by tonight so that I can have at least a little bit of sleep.  I know my depression plays a role, but I'm not always depressed.  But today I am for obvious reasons and I'm sleepy, but I don't want to take a nap to ruin my sleep ""schedule"".  I hope this doesn't stop someone else from at least trying it.  It's different for everybody.  Unfortunately it just wasn't for me as far as sleep goes.",Thowra'sGirl
1,Elavil,Insomnia,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2021",2,Using Elavil for sleep. 25 was too much broke in half.  Find you need to take it two to three hours before you want to sleep because of next day sedation.  Only part don’t like is my head feels like it’s full of rocks next morning.  Only third night using.  Will that go away?,Lizard

4,Elavil,Insomnia,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 19, 2020",62,"I've had insomnia almost every way you can have it, so I've tried the whole raft of sedatives and hypnotics. Only three have worked: diphenhydramine (Benadryl), doxepin/Silenor, and this. Just the fact that it keeps me asleep is such a godsend that I can't give it a bad review, but ...Of the three drugs that work, this is the worst. It has more neurological side effects, it puts me in a lousy mood that lasts most of the next day (not terrible, but maybe 25% grumpier than usual), and it leads to weight gain even at the lowest dose (10mg). If my hormones are out of whack (high cortisol) amitriptyline doesn't make me groggy, but if they're in line it really does, leaving me wool-headed until the middle of the afternoon. It also has negative interactions with a bunch of other drugs, so be careful to check it against your other prescriptions/recreational drugs.",Matvei
5,Elavil,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 14, 2020",85,"Elavil is an OUTSTANDING DRUG for insomnia!  Took 25mg 45 minutes before bed.  Now after 20 years I take 50mg. Without it, I can’t sleep at all! I’d rate it a 15!",Don
6,Elavil,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 10, 2019",103,"I was originally prescribed Elavil for a chronic cough, and it was amazing. Within about one hour after taking the first 10 mg tablet my cough was gone. I have, just like my grandfather and my mother, always suffered from insomnia. My Doctor mentioned that it was also a really good medicine for insomnia. I had been taking 75 mg of Benadryl for many years to help me sleep. I was able to completely stop taking benadryl and the Elavil has cured my insomnia too. I have not suffered any side effects at all.",Scooter
7,Elavil,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 30, 2019",108,"This is a terrible drug. Took Elavil 25g as was prescribed arthritis pain which would also help with insomnia. Put me in a hazy not a full sleep with vivid scary nightmares which were very disturbing and terrifying. My heart was pounding loudly in my chest, sweating, unable to feel anything, felt totally spaced out until six the following evening. Shaky, nervous and very anxious. Could not safely drive as I felt drunk.  Take my advise keep away from this drug it’s scary and frightening.",Sam
8,Elavil,Insomnia,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 6, 2019",57,Amitriptyline has been a godsend for my insomnia. I get a really good sleep eight nights out of 10 with this medication. Started with 10 mg and moved up to 50 mg. It gives me a hangover during much of the next day and I always have to take a nap in the late afternoon but without it I can't sleep at all.,smack

10,Elavil,Insomnia,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 5, 2018",80,"I'm 65 years old so when the benzo stop being effective, I used Amitriptyline ( elavil) to sleep. I have to take 3 X 10mg with half of a banana to make it smoother on the empty stomach, to make it work. It has some nasty side effects but they tend to go away after a while. Constipation will not be a problem anymore after a 1 months, drink a lot of water early in the evening to prevent constipation. Dry mouth will always be there, but will become less severe after a while, so chew some gum to fix this problem. Sex will also take a low profile :-)  This drug can also be use to make the withdrawal of the benzos much easier to do. You will still sleep and will only need a small dosage of benzo which you can lower slowly but surely. I get a better sleep pattern than the benzos. Waking up ready to drive my car if I need to , unlike the Ambien. Cheap to buy also. My old mother still use it after almost 50 years of usage. She is 85.",sirius1
11,Elavil,Insomnia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 10, 2018",34,"Elavil 10mg was prescribed mainly for my 24/7 migraine type symptoms and increasing nerve pain.  But also for these symptoms now keeping me up at night.   I was always a decent sleeper.  But 2 yrs ago as the head bounce increased so did my upset over it, and it caused chronic insomnia. Elavil works well for nerve pain. I found even handling jigsaw pieces felt like knives cutting into my fingers.  Pleasant right?  Elavil allowed me to NOT feel that pain! Insomnia. - works!  However a month ago- after the third night it increased my head pain.  Like sharp stabs. Soooooo.  I take 10mg once every few weeks.  I realize that isn’t protocol but don’t care.    I mix mybedtime routine with an occasional Benadryl and nothing at all.  Then another Elavil.   Took the Elavil after not taking it for a month last night.  Was able to catch up after 2 bad nights.  Ahhhhhhhh......  slept very well.  Bottle goes back into drawer for another few weeks",Pricklypear

Until I asked about elavil and it was a god send. The only side effect I noticed was constipation. Maybe increase in appetite too.,Cdontask
13,Elavil,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 2, 2017",39,"I told my doctor about my symptoms and he told me that my symptoms did not appear in his medical handbook so he disregarded my symptoms completely. He said it was mandatory for him to report any symptom not listed in his book to the proper health authorities to update the handbook. However, he didn't report the side effects that I told him about because it was ""too much paperwork."" Instead, he tried to convince me that it had nothing to do with Elavil and in a threatening demeanour tried to change my mind about my symptoms so that he would not be forced to do any paperwork. After reading this site on Elavil, I see the symptoms that I told my doctor about. I find that my doctor acted in an unsafe, unprofessional, and negligent manner.",John AB

I'm up for 3 -4 days straight and after my doctor prescribed me a combination of zopiclone and amitriptyline I'm able to sleep 4-5 hours but your body can become tolerant after a while meaning you may have to increase your dosage. I've had to do this but what I've started to do is try to keep really busy throughout the day and IF needed at night I'll take a smaller dose than prescribed to me or try to go a few days without it then take my regular dose.

Your body always needs more and more to produce the same effect until almost nothing works. Fortunately, this type of medication doesn't affect me that way. Although I guess it is mainly used for depression. It has worked like a charm for me to get my body to sleep much longer. And I have never had to increase the dose. The only drawback for me with this medication is that when I do wake up I am pretty groggy for about 45 minutes.",Anonymous
