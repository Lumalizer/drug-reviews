0,Gabapentin,Insomnia,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 27, 2022",0,"Tried for a few days 50-100mg Gabapentin as a low dose add-on to 12.5mg zolpidem for insomnia. I took zolpidem and gabapentin 30 mins before bed. Gabapentin improved deepness and satisfaction of sleep at 100mg, muted quite effectively my daily headaches after meals, but made reaching orgasm completely impossible even at those low doses. I'm a middle aged male and have difficulty reaching orgasm but gabapentin took that to a complete impossibility. The anorgasmic effect is described in the medical literature but I was hoping it won't spill over during the day since gabapentin is alleged to have a short half-life of 7 hours. It's effect on the nervous system seem to last the whole day - I've read somewhere that it boost production of GABA in the brain, in which case the 7 hour half life does not apply.",samueldj
1,Gabapentin,Insomnia,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2022",1,"12 years ago my grandpa died and that was a huge trigger for me. I started to have anxiety and later insomnia and depression. I tried many meds and also was addicted and created a tolerance. I have also Bipolar Type 2 and taking Lamotrigine in the morning. Today I begged my doctor to prescribe me GABA after many good reviews here. He said that I will not sleep and was very sceptic :(But I hope it’s not true even if it will need a bit of time to find the right dosing, I will sleep one day. Fingers crossed!

After reading some studies I asked my doctor to prescribe gabapentin. That together with half dose of Lunesta seems to be doing the trick. Getting good 7 hours of sleep and wake up only once a night. First month or so I experienced severe grogginess which seemed to get better. A good large cup of coffee helps.

Sleep was deeper, dreams were lucid, slight grogginess after waking. I'd say this medication is no better than Trazadone, Hydroxazine or any OTC sleep aid. Kinda disappointing.",Tom
9,Gabapentin,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 21, 2021",192,"Taking this drug, for me, was taking the tiger by the tail. And I got eaten in the end. Lol, to be less dramatic, I used 300 to 600 mg gabapentin for sleep every night for fourteen months. It worked like a dream and I thought my lifelong debilitating sleep issues were over. No. It stopped working. I sleep even worse ON the drug now than I used to sleep without it. And when I don’t take it, I have complete insomnia—not even a doze all night. I know I could increase my dose and maybe be okay for another six months or another year. But I have to get off of it sometime if it’s just going to stop working periodically. I can’t increase the dose forever. I wonder how long it will take to withdrawal? I wonder if I’ll ever sleep well again? Maybe I’ll update this post or post again when I find out.",Erin

13,Gabapentin,Insomnia,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 19, 2020",53,"I've had so many kinds of insomnia for so many reasons, including sleep apnea, cortisol and endocrine issues, anxiety, caffeine abuse, and genetics (family history on both sides). I've tried almost everything out there for insomnia, and only three pills have worked: diphenhydramine, doxepin/Silenor, and amitriptyline. But they all cause weight gain and lead to tolerance, so I try not to use them too often.That said, gabapentin is an awesome, awesome drug, so calming and (for me at least) almost totally without side effects at 300mg. It doesn't put me to sleep or keep me asleep, but I keep it by my bed for any early wake ups, for which it sometimes works: about half the time it puts me back to sleep for that extra 60-90 minutes I really need but my body hates to give me, and it always puts me in a good mood.",Matvei

16,Gabapentin,Insomnia,10.0,,"February 11, 2020",172,"Hi. I've been prescribed Gabapentin 100mg 2 times daily in the past and again recently to no avail for sleep and anxiety, so I put them aside and gave up until recently after viewing other people's comments I talked to my doctor about upping the dose as I saw that many people were on a much higher dose than I was. He agreed knowing I have a high tolerance to most medications and preferred I use it instead of Xanax. He told me to take 200mg 2 times a day and I I finally felt something that relaxed me but not so I could stay asleep at night, so again he upped my dose to 300mg 2 times daily. Now I am calm in the day and have no problem falling asleep after relaxing for a few hours before bed. Also, I did not have any side effects at all using Gabapentin. Many comments posted say that it's a matter of getting the right dosage for you and it seemed that was true in my case also. So any one out there struggling like I did, I suggest you don't give up and talk to your doctor, you are not alone.",Trisha

I was having problems sleeping so  I went to my doctor who gave me a prescription of Gabapentin my dose is to take 2 when needed & 2 at bedtime. I found that they also help me with chronic pain & severe arthritis from full hip replacement. Unfortunately, the surgery that I had had did not go as planned. I have had pain & 3 other surgeries since I was 8 or 9 yrs old & now I am in my 50’s. I like to lie in bed & read for a bit before I go to sleep so sometimes if I don’t go to bed as soon as I take my Gabapentin, they seem to wear off a bit.

I have woken up before during the night on it to use the bathroom and I fall right back to sleep, no tossing and turning and wishing I could fall back to sleep which is my usual scenario.  I also think I am more calm with less anxiety but possibly that is the result of a SOLID nights sleep.

52,Gabapentin,Insomnia,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 11, 2018",23,"I began taking 300mg gabapentin a few weeks ago for severe insomnia, and anxiety disorder. This was prescribed to me as an attempt to wean me off of Xanax, which I had built up a high tolerance to. My doctor suggested to me, that I start taking 300mg at first at night, and begin taking it during the day as a way to aid my anxiety. I haven't​ taken it during the day because of the side affects I am experiencing at night (dizziness and anxiety). Instead of relaxing me it makes me somewhat anxious and also foggy. I continued taking it only at night but even hours after taking the drug I still wouldn't become relaxed enough to fall asleep and my ruminating thoughts had amplified. My doctor suggested upping my dose to 600mg before bed but I am weary of doing this since I had a couple nights of sleep out of weeks of being on this med and even on those nights it took hours until I fell asleep.

54,Gabapentin,Insomnia,8.0,,"April 6, 2018",34,"If you are having success with Trazadone or another safe sleep aid, keep doing what you are doing, but I find Gabapentin works great for insomnia and anxiety.  When I read the other reviewers who were not having success, it looked like they were on too low a dose to make a difference with sleep.  At first I had success with 200mg at bedtime only, but that was when I was also taking Lorazepam at night.  Because we wanted to get me off of Lorazepam for good, we increased the dose to 400 mg at night and 100mg at dinnertime.  This has worked well with helping me to get off Lorazepam. I agree with the reviewers who say take it a couple of hours before you NEED to be asleep.  Sometimes it works faster, but it will take at least 30 min-1 hour and sometimes 2 hours.  And you need to help it by not doing anything stressful after you take it.  Calm down and relax.  For those patients not getting sleep help at 100mg, I would say talk to your doctor about upping your dosage to 200 or more mgs.",kb

Things like some tingling, little blurred vision, etc. Nothing that concerned me given my sleep was improving after so long with very little sleep.  The other nice effect was at 700mg I started noticing my anxiety that I had had was becoming less. The other nice effect the anxious thoughts I got when I laid down became very controllable.

By ""mild"" I mean go to sleep fast, but wake up in a couple of hours staring at the ceiling. This cycle repeats several times a night. Gabapentin eliminated that problem. Now with only 200 mg before bedtime, I sleep all the way through the night! It also has the added benefit of helping nerve pain in my neck. I take Gab with prescription Advil  (for arthritis in neck) when the pain is at a high level and the combo really helps bring down the intensity of the pain to a manageable level.Added bonus? Absolutely NO side effects. :)",biscotti

Although the CPAP helps the apnea, I still was waking up every hour or two during the night, never getting a restful night sleep. Then I was prescribed gabapentin for nerve pain and discovered that it also works for my sleep. I wake rested and have much more energy. Apparently GABA helps increase slow wave sleep so I am dreaming more also.",Very helpful

I was on Ambien 10 mg for 8 months, which helped, I slept but the fact of addiction was ever present.  I was switched to gabapentin by my neurologist for migraines, and taken off the Ambien.  I thought at first it was useless, I was wired and wide awake, but by the third to fourth day, I noticed I was dreaming again, which I had rarely done in 9 months.  I feel much more rested, where as I had been taking naps any day I could, due to insomnia even on Ambien, and hardly need to now.  I do feel somewhat groggy, but I only take it at night, and it is 600 mg. dose.",Overworked one

I have chronic fatigue syndrome/ME, irritable bowel syndrome-D, depression and anxiety. I take 500mg in total throughout the day. My main reason for reporting my experience is that it helps so much with my IBS-D. I have taken many anti-diarrhoea medicines with little effect.I can now eat foods that caused cramping and urgent diarrhoea. I now also take laxatives every day. I much prefer trying to manage constipation than the uncontrollable urgent diarrhoea. The IBS-D has been so crippling and I have had it for more than 25yrs.

I tried many other medicines to combat insomnia and they all proved not to work. I was pleasantly surprised how GABA worked. It helps keep me in very deep sleep for 6 hours. After that I wake up, but can easily get to sleep. The dreams are very vivid, but not unpleasant. I had to tweak my dosage however. I'm now at 1200 mg at night and sleep with total ease. Full disclosure, my insomnia has roots in anxiety, so this medicine proved to be effective because it helps with Anxiety too. I'm happy!",Flip Mo Better

The next day the grogginess wasn't as bad and my doc said that that side effect will decrease soon. Other than that, I feel like this is a miracle for restless legs syndrome and insomnia.
