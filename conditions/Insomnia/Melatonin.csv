I feel like because of my PTSD I'm alert even when I'm asleep, and melatonin helps me sleep much deeper. I have at least four separate dreams on nights I take melatonin. I fall asleep much quicker as well. When I can only sleep for a little, I feel much better the next day when I take melatonin before sleeping than when I take caffeine after I wake up. 10/10",Sara

3,Melatonin,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2022",3,"Was prescribed Melatonin to help me sleep. I do suffer from anxiety and depression.I was on Mirtazapine on a very low dose which has a sedative affect, which worked, however my GP decided to put me on Melatonin.Horrible experience. Couldn't sleep, but when I did I had horrible dreams. Tossing and turning. I don't know why I kept taking it. The last few nights I was taking more tablets to help me sleep, which obvious made it worse. I thought it was my anxiety causing this. I had really bad suicidal thoughts and even visited a place I thought I could jump off. I finally realised it was the Melatonin. It's now in the bin.Be careful if notice anything different in your thought patterns and sleep patterns, especially if you have anxiety and or depression",Adam

10,Melatonin,Insomnia,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 20, 2021",1,"In the UK you have to get a prescription for melatonin, which took me over a year of fighting as none of the doctors wanted to prescribe it. It’s commonly prescribed to autistic people and people with ADHD (I’m both) for our sleep issues, and for delayed sleep phase syndrome (which I also have).I take it in addition to mirtazapine. Together they make my sleep almost normal, the mirtazapine gets me to sleep in a couple of hours and the melatonin keeps me asleep through the night. I also noticed after a while on melatonin that when I see darkness out the window at night I feel sleepy, which I never had before. The prescription says I can take two 10mg a night, and I’ve been on 6mg for months now with no issues, no side effects.",Cass
11,Melatonin,Insomnia,1.0,,"July 3, 2021",58,"I have used Melatonin for insomnia, it helps me to fall a sleep faster, but frequent urination from 5am wakes me up which is not normal. Then in the morning feeling anxious and depressed for no specific reason, dizzy and tearful all day, fatigue and tiredness all day, unable to take my simple daily walk on a beach. Questioning my life and very dark mood. Nausea and no appetite all day, sleepy all day, headache. I took only 2.5mg for 4 days and then stopped. Feeling fine after 2 days. During these two days felt very dizzy, nauseated and tired. To be sure it was that I did test it once again month later, took only 1.25mg for 3 days and each day was worst then day before. It doesn't matter on the dosage, both times, I feel bad with all side effects above. I found out much better alternative is Magnesium Glycinate supplement which does not have any side effects on me, simply took 100-200mg pills magnesium and fall a sleep within an hour and slept well till' morning with no side effects next day.",Robb
12,Melatonin,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 25, 2021",18,"I have had trouble falling asleep my whole life. I have had anxiety and a fear of bedtime due to all of the nights spent tossing and turning. I became accustomed to marijuana or alcohol as a sleep aid. I recently got a sleep tracker called Pura which shows exactly when different sleep cycles begin and end. This allowed me to clearly see what quality of sleep I was getting and what affected it. It led me to try different dosages of melatonin. It has completely changed my life. I now sleep effortlessly and get much higher quality sleep. Everyone will find a different formula. For me, the optimal dosage is a 3 mg extended release tablet. Any more than three and I would wake up drowsy with tingly fingers. Even 1 mg is enough to knock me out, though I get better REM sleep with the extended release.",FoxSoup
13,Melatonin,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 3, 2021",6,I've been taking melatonin most nights for 27 years. I find 10 mg works best for me. Brands vary widely in their effectiveness and side effects. I was taking a chewable meltaway kind that was the best but it was discontinued. Now I try different brands trying to find one that works as quickly as as well. One type of chewable made me very restless. I realized after a few nights it was making my blood pressure spike. Right now I take the gummies which work ok without side effects.,Alve

16,Melatonin,Insomnia,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2020",2,"Be careful when taking melatonin with birth control. I was aware that there is a possible interaction but there is not much info that’s accessible that goes into detail about it. I have tried taking melatonin 3 times, for a couple days each months apart, and each time has triggered a period to happen which never occurs otherwise, since I am on a progestin-only pill which is continuous and doesn’t have any breaks for withdrawal bleeding. I know spotting can happen regardless of drug interactions but the only time it has for me (after being on that birth control for almost a year) is after taking melatonin, even as small an amount as 1 mg. I don’t know how it interacts with other kinds of birth control. As for the drug itself it works well, I think taking the smallest possible amount you need is the best way to go because a little can go a long way. It did result in more vivid dreams for me but they were not unwelcome.",neers

I’ve been taking it for over a week now, and I find that it only really works (and when it does, I’m passed out) when I set the mood - dim lights, comfortable bedding and space with light music / silence, otherwise I just procrastinate sleeping for hours if the mood isn’t set. I do have wild, vivid dreams, but I’ve had them even before taking this, so I’m used to it. But I do find that I need to sleep for 9-12+ hours to feel like sleep is complete. If I get up and going before, I will then feel like some time during the day that it is incomplete and it needs to be finished. I think I would like to try another pill.",Lo

Took melatonin to help me fall asleep, and have had the strangest experiences. Some nights it works beautifully and I fall asleep quickly, wake up feeling refreshed. Other nights I take it and find I’m thrashing around for hours and hours; my mind thinks I’m awake but the next morning I realize I was sleeping. It feels like an extremely lucid dream, where I cannot move my body but my brain knows everything that’s going on around me. Also sends my heart racing and feels like I’m wide awake while I’m actually in a light sleep. However, it combats my daytime anxiety very well when I do use it before bed (this is a big pro, social anxiety is annoying and common). I’m also mildly irritable after using it, and experience a ‘crash’ around 1-3 pm. If you’re having mild trouble sleeping I’d advise changing some habits before you try melatonin.",Sady

27,Melatonin,Insomnia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 16, 2020",20,"I have had chronic insomnia for 20 years, and usually coped by taking afternoon naps when I had to work through a day on 4-6 hours of sleep, or exercising extremely hard to tire myself out (neither is a long-term good solution). Melatonin works extremely well for me. I would recommend carefully starting with 1mg and increasing 1mg at a time only to the extent that it's necessary. If I take 2mg  I'm asleep in an hour with a 50% likelihood, and if I take 5mg I'm asleep in 45 minutes with a 90% likelihood. But the vivid, often disturbing dreams are more common on nights when I take the larger dose. Still worth it to me even with the dreams. I personally have not had any of the side effects from melatonin other people have mentioned like an increase in depression or suicidal thoughts, and I'm extremely prone to both of those. Aside from marijuana, this is my best option for getting 8 hours of sleep regularly.",zzzzzzz

I have been unable to sleep due to damage to my own melatonin production due to 19 years of being on high dose of antidepressants. I can't produce enough melatonin.  I thought my body would sleep eventually, but no. Longest was three days of being awake, losing cognitive function and having to turn to sleeping tablets, which only worked short term. This medication has saved me. I will be on this long term (with dr monitoring) After reading other reviews I feel this medication only seems to be helpful with sleep phase disorders when your body is not producing melatonin at the correct time, or for people like me who don't produce effective levels of melatonin to create sleep. In people with normal levels who have insomnia for other reasons it seems ineffective. It would be like people who don't have diabetes taking insulin to feel better. ",Anonymous

Then suddenly I was having severe mood swings that could not be attributed to time of month and they got worse. I was flaring up with anger at the slightest thing and extremely harsh on two service providers that let me down. I was often angry for no reason and unable to control this constant feeling of being wound up. I didn't attribute this to the melatonin at first, but it had crossed my mind. Then, out of the blue, the melatonin simply stopped working, it no longer produced that wonderful drowsy feeling I would get before sleep (and have been missing most of my life) nor did it induce sleep any longer. I would be wide awake at 4am still after taking it at 5pm the day before. After a couple of weeks off it I noticed the aggression totally subsided. I would not use Melatonin again because it’s not worth the behavioural changes of severe mood changes. I would write more but there is a character limit.",Kylie
