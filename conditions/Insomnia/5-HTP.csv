0,5-HTP,Insomnia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2021",0,Works for Cannabis-related insomnia when I've stopped smoking after prolonged daily use. After researching online and using on and off for a few weeks I use around 100-150mg depending on how tired I feel (recommend starting much lower ~50mg).  Very noticeable effect on sex drive so only tend to use it when I know that's not going to be an issue (If it's going to be a problem don't take it 2-3 days before and you should be fine).,Anonymous
1,5-HTP,Insomnia,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 29, 2021",2,"Was recommended to take 5 HTP because I have no problem falling asleep, but rather staying asleep. Took 100 mg and slept better (still work up but it a much calmer way), but then next day after taking 100mg again I could tell it prevented me falling asleep and also elevated my heart rate to the point that I couldn’t sleep at all. Am going to speak to a doctor to ask whether it might work at a significantly lower dose. So many websites say 100 mg is fine and even say 200mg is ok to start with—I wish more recommended 25 max to begin, especially if you’re sensitive.",Anonymous
2,5-HTP,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 3, 2021",15,"Solgar 5-htp 100mg. 1xdaily. First three days it helps with my insomnia, nice 7-8h sleep, but no change with anxiety or mood, then I started waking up at 3am sweaty with elevated heart rate and having very vivid bad dreams and it continued during the day with tension headache and severe anxiety and depression, didn't know 5-htp causing it so I continued taking it. Things get worst to the level that I  was stuck in dark mood and suicide feelings. I stopped taking them. 3 days later my system cleared and was back to normal. Some of us are sensitive to these "" brain chemical adjusters"".",Robb
3,5-HTP,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 18, 2020",6,I have been using 300mg of 5 HTP at bedtime as well as Klonopin. It works for me. I have severe insomnia due to a problem with fibromyalgia. That being said. Go for it. The Klonopin alone didn't do it but the combo cocktail does. I feel like the quality of sleep is better also. My chemical complex is strange. I need large doses of anything to benefit.,Cheryl
4,5-HTP,Insomnia,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 21, 2020",14,Just a few comments regarding 5 HTP and Melatonin.  Often the actual tablet strength is the problem. The tablet strengths are insanely high.   100mg of 5 HTP is way too much and can turn you into a sleepy zombie but you don't sleep.  Melatonin is even worse.  A 3mg tablet of Melatonin is off the charts too much.  I crush a melatonin tablet and take a crumb or two and it knocks me out cold.  A 3mg tablets lasts me at least a week.  5 HTP is good at around 25mg however long term the zombie effect starts.   You feel asleep but you actually awake.   Hormones that affect your brain are in your body in extremely small quantities.,Grego
5,5-HTP,Insomnia,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2019",13,I've been taking 5-HTP 400mg for 2 months to try and help with insomnia and depression.  But I don't feel any different at all?  I don't understand it as other people have reported success so so I was hopeful for this stuff.,Sarah
6,5-HTP,Insomnia,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 19, 2019",7,I bought some 400mg high strength tablets after reading good reviews about 5HTP and knowing I have a high tolerance medicines.I took tablet around 8pm hoping to feel a bit drowsy by bedtime but it's 00:15am and I'm still wide awake even though I also took 2 zopiclone at 10.55pm and ran 13 km earlier and done a full 9 hour day at work today. I feel a little bit queasy in stomach but it's hard to say as I do have a lingering chesty cough right now too. Feel a bit anxious as I want them to work.,Trialling l
7,5-HTP,Insomnia,,,"September 2, 2019",21,"Started taking 5HTP with magnesium. Had to get online as its not an approved drug in Australia. After 2 bottles I had to come off it as it was  upsetting my bowel. I started having panic attacks, depression,  insomnia. This withdrawal lasted 4 weeks. There should be a warning about coming off this med, be careful. Maybe this is why its not approved here.",Aries
8,5-HTP,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 31, 2019",15,"Took 5-HTP for insomnia but it made it worse, gave me stomach cramps and made me feel hungover the next day, horrible.",Dave
9,5-HTP,Insomnia,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 10, 2019",21,"Have been trying various doses (100 mg before bed - 100 mg 3 times during the day) of 5-HTP for chronic insomnia and it has made things significantly worse.  Agitated and utterly unable to sleep.  Even when I add melatonin, which has helped somewhat before, I am having terrible nights.Perhaps this is not surprising as Prozac 10 mg also made sleep impossible for me.Hoping this side effect will drop off if I continue, or lower the dose, but thought I'd share this for anyone else having a similar experience.",JL
10,5-HTP,Insomnia,10.0,,"August 17, 2016",46,"I've struggled with sleep-onset insomnia for 15+ years. It started in my early forties when perimenopause hit. Tried 5-HTP recently and after 2 weeks I'm sleeping great! I take 200 mg time-release an hour before bed. Also drink milk/buttermilk before bed. And gelatin mixed with hot water and juice earlier. I only take Ambien or Ativan when I still can't get to sleep but that's unusual. Since I'm sleeping sounding again like when I was younger, my energy level is back to normal and I feel great again! I also changed my diet to low sugar/ high fiber. 5-HTP is a life saver to me!!!",Econut
11,5-HTP,Insomnia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 26, 2016",57,"I take 5-htp for both insomnia and anxiety .The benzos and other meds didn't work anymore . So I've started to take 100 mg of 5-htp at night with a bit (7.5 mg) of mirtazipine and bang , gone for the WHOLE night. Incredible. I was so happy after searching for a remedy for years. I've started to take some small doses of 5 htp during day time ( 50mg at noon) and my anxiety is down. Now I have to let go the ATIVAN slowly but surely for my daily anxiety because it is now useless so I just have to figure out the right dosage and hope to use only this and nothing else for my sleeping problem and anxiety. ( don't forget the vitamin B6 to make it work better) So I went from a bunch of pills at night to almost nothing :-)",sirius1
12,5-HTP,Insomnia,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 25, 2015",33,I have a love hate relationship with 5 HTP. it has definitely helped me sleep in the past but after a while I build up a tolerance. I don't like stopping and restarting because the first few days of restarting give me an upset stomach.,Anonymous
13,5-HTP,Insomnia,,,"March 30, 2014",57,"I love 5-htp because it not only helps with my sleeping patterns but its definitely had a noticeable difference in me having a better, non-dreading approach to life. ",BigBrainTheory
14,5-HTP,Insomnia,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 28, 2012",30,Natural alternative - prescribed by my M.D. helped 'boost' effect of Lunesta when I wasn't sleeping long enough at night.,WaterskiGirl
15,5-HTP,Insomnia,5.0,,"August 11, 2011",71,It works very well with my Ambien pills which have almost stopped working but can't sleep without (sounds familiar to chronic insomniacs I guess). I fall asleep amazingly fast (faster than at any time in my life) and I sleep up to 8 hours which I had forgotten about even on Ambien!I take only 50mg in late afternoon with food because I have a sensitive stomach. I wish I had tried this before.,Anonymous
