3,Amitriptyline,Insomnia,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 30, 2022",2,"Hi everyone, I started Amitriptyline 30 days ago for a sleep disorder that seems to run in the family: trouble falling and staying a sleep.  I took 25 mg 2-3 hours before bed. Pro’s: my sleep has significantly improved almost from day 1. Instead of lying awake for 3-4 hours and then sleeping on average 3-4 hours p/n, I now fall asleep within 1 hour and sleep 6 hours on average p/n. Wake up far more rested than before.Cons: the only side effect was that my heart rate went up from 65 to 100 bpm during rest. After a light exercise such as walking stairs, it felt like my heart would beat out of my chest. I’ve always been sporty and never had such symptoms before. All in all, for me this was a very effective antidepressant used off label for sleep. I choose to stop taking it because the increased heart rate. Nonetheless, definitely recommend it to troubled sleepers since its effective, non-addictive and every body is unique. Good luck!",sca33

One of the most amazing property of this drug was it ability to shut my brain off while sleeping. For the past 30 years my drug manufacture was Mylan. Unfortunately  Mylan quit producing Amitriptyline in 2021. I was horrified hearing this news. My nightly ritual of taking Mylan was interrupted after 30 years. For the past year I am taking amitriptyline  HCL from Par Pharma unfortunately it's effect is starting to wear off. I know this because after 30 years of no side effects and perfect sleep I'm starting to wake up at night from dreams. I'm on the hunt for a different manufacture but remain so very sad that Mylan quit making Amitriptyline.  Does anyone out there know of an amitriptyline manufacturethat can compare to Mylan?  To be clear and this is important , the thirty years of using Mylan I had no dreams and no waking up from dreams. It may sound sad that I prefer no dreams, but, for me it was best 30 years.",Anonymous

Thankfully today is my day off.  I'm hoping it's out of my system by tonight so that I can have at least a little bit of sleep.  I know my depression plays a role, but I'm not always depressed.

24,Amitriptyline,Insomnia,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 4, 2021",14,"So I've been on amitriptyline for about 6 months.  I gradually moved my way up in dosages from 25mg to what I'm taking now 75mg. When I first started out, it was kind of rough. I was dizzy the whole 1st month I took it, would end and then come back. Also, my chest would get that ""sinking"" sensation like, a fight or flight response. It did eventually go away, but as far as the sleep goes, it does put you to sleep, but not so much at keeping you asleep. I sleep about 4-5 hours, experience a crazy dream or nightmare, and then I wake up. I can usually go back to sleep after a little bit, but it takes some time. I kinda wish I could sleep 7-8 hours nonstop without waking up in the middle of the night, but maybe I'll have to increase the dosage to see if that works.",Jster

Tried sleep pattern adjustment, melatonin, bright lights to no avail until recently my doctor prescribed 10 mg  amitriptyline to take before bed.From day 4 I started to feel my morning fatigue improved. I am on tablet 17 and I can attest that I have never felt as good as I feel in the last 9 years.I understand this drug is normally used for depression but now is used more widely as off label for many other disorders.I never though this would give me such a great quality sleep.I never write in forums but I think anyone on circadian disorders like mine should speak to its Dr and perhaps give it a try.",LM76

Sleep dialing? Sleep driving!?! I guess death IS a cure for insomnia ...)Amitriptyline isn't that scary, and it helps for mild insomnia. (When I had severe insomnia amitriptyline was powerless, the adrenaline blew right through it.) It isn't great at putting me to sleep but it is wonderful at putting me BACK to sleep, so if that's you it might work. Amitriptyline sleep is refreshing too, not groggy at all.The big con is mood. Whenever I take this I wake up emotionally schizoid. Half of me is in love with the world because of the heavenly sleep but the other half is salty as anything, irritated by everything until about 6 PM when the irritability mysteriously vanishes. It feels like the anger after a night of normal insomnia ... except that I slept!

Just the fact that it keeps me asleep is such a godsend that I can't give it a bad review, but ...Of the three drugs that work, this is the worst. It has more neurological side effects, it puts me in a lousy mood that lasts most of the next day (not terrible, but maybe 25% grumpier than usual), and it leads to weight gain even at the lowest dose (10mg). If my hormones are out of whack (high cortisol) amitriptyline doesn't make me groggy, but if they're in line it really does, leaving me wool-headed until the middle of the afternoon.

81,Amitriptyline,Insomnia,10.0,,"August 23, 2018",31,"Amitriptyline is a good for insomnia but you have to know it how to use it, which means when you start with low dose like 10mg then if you manage to sleep take it for 10-15 days then start to minimise the dose . If you don't sleep with 10mg, try with 25mg if not 25mg then try 50mg . Then after 15 -20days later start to reduce the dose. So if you were taking 50mg start taking 35mg and check your sleep condition, what I mean if you feel terror or restless legs or something then back to take 50mg but if you just sleep 5-6hrs that is fine, you don't need to sleep like before because you are on withdrawal ,then from 35mg reduce to 30mg wait 3 or 4 days same dose then take 25mg 3 or 4 days then 15mg 3 or 4 days then 10mg 3 or 4 days then 5mg 3 or 4 days still check your physical condition symptoms like restless leg, terror, sweating it will happen during withdrawal that is fine.

Instead of waking five or six times a night, I now wake up only once or twice. I still have to take Lunesta to fall asleep. So for insomnia I give Ami a big thumbs up.
