0,Doxepin,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 23, 2022",0,I was recently prescribed Doxepin for insomnia. I took my very first dose last night and I'm happy to admit that I got 7 hours of rest. This morning I feel fully rejuvenated and that in itself is saying something. It took approximately an hour and a half to make me drowsy enough to close my eyes and fall to sleep. Doxepin is a game changer for people that aren't able to get a full night of uninterrupted rest. Best wishes...,Elusive Anomaly

Next day I kept zoning out, completely unfocused and uncoordinated, side-tracked when trying to tell someone my number and email address, terrible nightmares, woke up to panic attacks, started hearing things that weren't real (I was the only person in the library, but I heard intense typing. I checked all the desks and behind the counter and I was the only person in there), I also kept heard a gong sound. Several people were staring at me. One person said I must be manic.

I am taking the 50 mg capsules when I am at the bed. Even you fell unrelaxed, but you are in the bed, wait to 10 15 minutes, and then take it. You also have to have at least 7-8 hours for sleep.  I took this medication for two years. My confidence increased and my face became younger  looking. My happiness, my face and my behavior tremendously changed. Before taking this medication, some people were being mean because I was coward, and nervous, but now I am in a very good situation. I taking this medication for 2 years.

It seems to increase my anxiety—in fact I  awake after about 2.5 hrs with an overwhelming sense of fear, and was sweating profusely, had tremors and confusion. It also leaves me feeling a strange anxiety tension in my body for at least 24 hrs and has significant effects on my short term memory. When I was sleeping, it seemed to do a pretty good job.

I mentally feel tired but physically I don’t. Most nights I don’t go to bed until 6-7am and sleep until 4pm. I quit drinking caffeinated drinks about 6pm and I’m laying down by 11pm. Eventually I toss and turn and look at the phone to see what time it is and it’s usually 2-3am. So I get upset and cry because I’m so tired! Personally I don’t know what to do! I’ve been on trazodone in the past and it did nothing for me. I’m running out of options.,Anonymous

I took it Sunday night and today, Tuesday afternoon, I’m still groggy. I train BJJ and during class Monday night, I had a dizzy spell where the room was spinning. Scary to say the least.

22,Doxepin,Insomnia,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 10, 2021",3,I've  tried many solutions for my insomnia and Doxepin was the most recent. Insurance wouldn't  cover the 3 or 6 mg tablets but did cover the 10mg capsules which is what I  ended up taking. The good news is that I didn't  wake up during the night but the bad news is that I  woke up groggy in the morning and felt drowsy throughout much of the day. I continued taking it for more than two weeks without any improvements in the side effects so I  decided to move on to something else.,Lonerock44
23,Doxepin,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 22, 2021",8,I had tried eight medications prior to doxepin for sleep and of course improving my sleep hygiene. Doxepin is the only consistent medication that is guaranteed to make me sleepy enough to go to bed up to an hour after I take it. It does take a bit to work but it will work. I also avoid taking it every night and try to go to bed by myself so as not to reduce its effectiveness.,mirrorgirl11

25,Doxepin,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 26, 2021",7,"This is what I’m currently taking, and I’m going to switch when I see my psychiatrist. The active ingredient Doxepin was reformulated into 3mg and 6mg tablets and branded Silenor. At lower doses it has antihistamine effects which is what is responsible for the sedation. At higher doses, it works as a tetracyclic/tricyclic antidepressant and has too many side effects. I’m just trying to sleep. I don’t need this drug binding to like 20 different receptors at capsule doses of 10mg-300mg. Completely ineffective for me. Not taking this again",Jakefiner
26,Doxepin,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 9, 2021",6,2 years ago I lost my 21 year old son. I couldn't sleep after that at all. I'd go 4-5 days with no sleep then I'd crash for a couple of hours and be wide awake again. My psychiatrist tried everything and I mean everything. Finally ziprasidone and seroquel worked. Then I started gaining weight from the seroquel. Like 65 pounds! So I begged him for something different but I had tried everything. Then yesterday he gave me some samples of silenor. It worked! I slept better than I have in 2 years. He told me that if seroquel made me gain weight then this wouldn't. I'm a little worried after reading some of these reviews though. I will say I'm also less anxious today than I am normally so I haven't taken a klonopin today. I haven't felt groggy today either like I normally do. So far so good.,Shea

I'm constantly exhausted. No matter what time IU take doxepin I still don't get any sleep. I'm so frustrated with this insomnia! I've taken so many different insomnia meds and I can't get a break.

29,Doxepin,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 18, 2021",2,I took 10 mg at night of Doxepin for several weeks. The local sleep dr gave me the script. He said I did not have sleep apnea. I have come off the medicine. My family said I was not myself. I was not thinking clearly. I made some odd and not myself mistakes. Too many side effects. My other comment is why do doctors give scripts- like band aides?  It makes more sense to get to the root of the problem instead of drugging people up.,retiredhome

This feels like a mental straitjacket, and I am NOT happy about the terrible mental effects of a drug I’ve been prescribed for insomnia. NOT WORTH IT. If you care about your brain functioning properly every day.

36,Doxepin,Insomnia,10.0,,"December 23, 2020",6,"Due to several difficult life-events and enormous stress I developed chronic insomnia that lasted around 2 years (early awakening after which I would not be able to fall asleep). For a long time I did not want to take antidepressants and helped myself with Z-drugs that helped me fall asleep. 2 specialists advised me to stop and try out Trazodone. Unfortunately, it did not work for. I then tried Doxepin, hoping that the small dosage (3-6 mg) would help. It didn't, so I increased to 50 mg, which I have continued taking for almost a year. It worked and my sleep normalized! Now I sleep enough for 98 percent of the time, which I feel is a miracle. My therapist, however, says, that the quiet life due to COVID might also have helped. Perhaps. In any case, I would like to decrease the dosage as I do not feel like taking antidepressants forever, but he advised me to wait a little more, for the psyche was stressed out a long time due to insomnia and needs to ""accept"" healthy sleep again.",Orlando

The doctor then gave me 10 mg of doxepin and said I could take 20 mg if I had too and honestly it doesn’t work.  I had my hopes high because he was saying how much he loved the medication. It might as well be a placebo, I took 20 mg and 5 hours later with proper sleep hygiene before and all I have is a dry mouth and the walls look like they’re breathing. It hasn’t really effected me differently and I’ve been taking this medication for awhile now. I honestly can’t recommend this medication.",Trey

It made me feel like my soul was being sucked from my body and I didn't care and was just watching myself from 10 inches away.
