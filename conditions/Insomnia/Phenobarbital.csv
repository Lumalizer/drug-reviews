0,Phenobarbital,Insomnia,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 10, 2020",9,"Phenobarbital (five 32.4mg tabs = 162mg) is an excellent sedative. It lasts the entire night although it does cause next-day sedation because of its very long half life. I wake up periodically but always fall back asleep and get 7-8 hours in total. I have found the OTC supplement 5HTP to be helpful in conjunction with the Phenobarbital.  Please beware of tolerance, dependence, and rebound effects. I would not use the drug for more than 7-10 nights at a time (with 2 week breaks). During breaks, I use other medications to help me sleep that do not have cross-tolerance with Phenobarbital so that tolerance to the Phenobarbital is reversed periodically.",college__student_
1,Phenobarbital,Insomnia,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 24, 2016",18,"I have severe insomnia. I've tried dozens of benzos, z-drugs, and natural supplements, and this is the only medication I've taken that allows me to fall asleep before midnight. I got a solid 5 hours of sleep on Phenobarbital. I didn't like though how I woke up so early in the morning... I feel my best when I get 8 hours of sleep. I probably need a higher dose next time",YahYouBetchaa
