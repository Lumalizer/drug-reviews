0,Ativan,Insomnia,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 27, 2022",0,"1mg twice a day has resulted in a reduction of manic behavior, but regular sleep still eludes me. I'm averaging 3-4 hrs/night on Ativan vs 1-2 prior to this prescription. Overall, the medication has proven effective in all ways *except* ability to sleep adequately.",Dimawi
1,Ativan,Insomnia,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 24, 2021",2,"I have had severe insomnia for over a decade. I’ve always been a light sleeper, but the past 8-9 years have been horrid. I am 48 years old . Have been prescribed every drug under the sun. After years of horrible sleep I now have severe anxiety. I have had to go on short term disability 3 times in 5 years. I usually hinged my insomnia and anxiety on work stress. I was assigned a new project that was very high profile and I started not sleeping for days on end. I went to the doctor before things got too bad, I did not want to end up on disability again. He prescribed Ativan. I started taking it, .5-1 mg a night. Soon  I was taking it every night, then after about 6 months it stopped working. I ended up in the hospital for a week, quit my job. Ativan works but you better hope it always does. Now on seroquel, and cannot sleep at all without it. Terrified for my families future as I am so unstable. I have a wife and 3 kids",Down in a hole
2,Ativan,Insomnia,,,"October 25, 2021",8,"I have been using ativan for nearly 18 years. I went for years sleeping 4 and a 1/2 hours a night.[daytime Zombie] About 4 years ago I was having short term memory problems. I reduced from 1mg to .05 and memory very much improved, and I still sleep 6-7 hours, but keep extra .05s if some night I need extra which isn't often. I would suggest that for 1st timers to start with .05 and it might be all you need.  As far as ""addiction"" goes, I am totally addicted to a good nights sleep. I am grateful to the lucky stars for ativan. Do not use often for anxiety, although helpful from time to time. I am 78 years old. Only my story, everyone has their  own experience with Ativan. Goodl uck and goodnight you sleepy heads. Rip Van Winkle [almost twenty years.",rip van winkle
3,Ativan,Insomnia,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 15, 2021",2,"Ativan can be a two-edged sword.  I have a prescription for 0.5 mg to be used as needed for anxiety and/or sleep.  It works really well for both.  I just have to be careful not to use it too often (it's tempting) because there are uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms.  I want to have it on hand because when I have a days-long anxiety episode, it's the only thing that helps calm me down.  However, my doctor told me that regular, long-term use of Ativan can increase the risk for Alzheimer's.  Articles I've read on this confirm his warning.  That's a good enough incentive for me to use it sparingly.  7/10 Stars for Ativan due to its helpfulness, but with accompanying risks.",David123456
4,Ativan,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 18, 2021",31,"I've always been reluctant to take benzos as clonopin was a nightmare for me. I gained weight and just didn't care what I put in my mouth. Ativan has been a life saver for insomnia or severe panic attack. Though I only take it at night 2mg. Sometimes I skip it. Its main use for me is chronic insomnia and nightmares. It's the only one that helps me sleep soundly. I try not to completely rely on it. I understand if I quit taking it my insomnia may come back due to my stress. If my life was better, I believe it could work short term as well. I highly recommend it as a sleep aid. I would use it just enough to get your natural rhythm of sleep back. It's long acting which makes a dose more effective at continuing to work.",Anna
5,Ativan,Insomnia,8.0,,"November 3, 2020",30,I get Ativan 1mg 1 tab 3x a day for anxiety and insomnia. I usually take 1/2 tab at night to have a good night sleep and save the rest incase I have a panic attack or bad anxiety.,Jen
6,Ativan,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 18, 2020",123,"After contracting a virus/ assumed COVID in May, I have had chronic insomnia. I’ve tried tons of sleep medications and some would give me a few hours of sleep, other only a couple hours. Then I tired Ativan! I got 6 hours my first time taking 2mg. I’m now sleeping 8 hours usually and I’m down to 1.25 mg. It’s been a literal lifesaver. I don’t want to be dependent on any drug, but when it comes to survival and wellbeing, I’m just very glad Ativan exists!",Sadie
7,Ativan,Insomnia,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 8, 2020",35,I have a fairly high medication resistant (or I'm allergic or develope tolerance after using meds .. yes it's been hell and still is .. I'm writing this while admitted to the hospital psych ward)I have severe insomnia and not one sleeping  medication has worked for more then a week! I took ativan sublingual and was up to 8mg in a week .. and it stopped working!! Now I'm on injections at night .. it worked for 2 nights amazingly!!! I don't have withdrawal symptoms like others have described on here ... I guess for me it's a great short term solution but then I build a tolerance.. sigh!!,Jay
8,Ativan,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 31, 2020",112,"Ativan ruined my life.  My psychiatrist prescribed me 2mg to take every night while trying out an anti-depressant.  After about 7 weeks, I was addicted to Ativan, and when I tried to stop taking it, I had seizures and panic attacks.  I had to keep taking it in order to stabilize.  Then I had to switch to Valium and slowly taper off the benzodiazapines in order to avoid another seizure.  It took me a year and a half to taper off, and I now have chronic fear, anxiety, tinnitus, and insomnia.  I wish I never touched this drug.",insomniac
9,Ativan,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 22, 2019",76,I have been using Ativan for sleep over the last few months and I must say it's been a real help. I strongly recommend that you only take it two to three times a week maximum otherwise you could become addicted to it and it's effects might no longer work. Moderation is the key here.,Digital
10,Ativan,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 29, 2019",166,"I am writing this review to help those who may be experiencing insomnia, anxiety and depression. Mine was the result of extreme past and present trauma. I stopped sleeping completely virtually overnight after a series of traumatic events. I did not sleep for several or more months and began to loose weight rapidly I went from 60 kg down to 38 kg as a result and became very unwell. After taking myself to hospital numerous times I did not find adequate help for my condition there. Eventually I met a very efficient GP and psychiatrist which after much trial and error found help from being prescribed a combination of amitriptyline and ativan. Although I am still on the road to recovery, this medication combination has helped me immensely. I sincerely hope that no one on earth has to experience the living hell that I did, only to find help when it was almost too late.",Nina

14,Ativan,Insomnia,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 12, 2018",45,"I used to take sublingual ativan for sudden anxiety and panic attacks and it worked well and quickly. I did find it calming, and so I didn't ever use it for insomnia per se, I did sometimes take it in the evening to relax and it did a fine job of that.",wcforan

16,Ativan,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 19, 2017",75,"I have been taking 1 1/2 mg every other night for sleep for the past 3 years. I have tried my other drugs for sleep and ativan is the only one that works consistently. Because of its addiction potential I take it only every other night.Also I have not had to increase the dosage in 3 years, which I believe is a result of not taking it every night.It is easier to tolerate my non-Ativan night of insomnia when I know I will be sleeping well the next night.",bashbish
17,Ativan,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 23, 2017",70,"I rarely have trouble falling asleep so that's not why I use it.  I use it to stay asleep if I wake up in the middle of the night for whatever reason.  There are times when I wake up 2-3 hours before I want to and my brain shifts into overdrive and I can't get back to sleep, or if I do, it takes me about an hour.  This medication eliminates that.  I only use it if I've had a few nights in a row like that. Then I get caught up and wake up rested.  I would never feel comfortable about using it nightly.  Thankfully I don't need to.  0.5mg is all it takes for me. I'm 5'3"" about 130 give or take 5lbs. A bottle of 30 lasts me several weeks or a few months.","Pam, RN  (use to stay asleep)"
18,Ativan,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 22, 2017",194,"I was prescribed Ativan (aka Lorezapam) because I had a head injury and my Doctor presumably thought that I had a very high level of anxiety (I wasn't getting enough sleep with the head injury so the Doctors perception was incorrect), but once I started using Ativan sleep woes disappeared completely of which I had always had problems staying asleep for virtually all of my life !Ativan (Lorezapam) puts you into a ""deep"" sleep, you don't wake up during the middle of the night (Or late night for that matter!), cuts dreaming down to virtually zero and is THE BEST SLEEP MEDICATION I HAVE ""EVER"" SEEN !!!My prescription was for 1mg and to be taken 1 hour before going to sleep which is exactly what I did !Effective Rating = ""10"" !",RickS64

It was empty and I was trying to get in that bed.  I had a heart monitor on, but I had moved out of my room, and was half dressed wandering the halls until I came on the nurse station.  Why didn't someone know I was having an issue, because of my disconnected heart monitor?  They put me back in bed and seemed upset at me.  They never explained.  I just took it once.  I was awake but couldn't see or know what has happened, or about to happen. Could have walked off a bldg. ",Kaneohe

I took one (.5) before bedtime before I left home to see how it worked and how strong it was.  Sadly I got zip out of it.  I am super sensitive to meds.. I take an aspirin and I know in 5 minutes I am 'medicated'. SO I am majorly disappointed. Now I am even more anxious about my trip. ugh.,humbuggie

23,Ativan,Insomnia,9.0,,"August 9, 2014",222,"I was given Ativan for occasional use. I try to use it once every week or once every ten days for sleep. (0.5mg). I'm lucky that I don't have to use it any more regularly because I don't work right now. I find that it helps me relax to sleep, and I wake up feeling and looking rested. The looking rested part is important because it tells me how good it is at actually calming the anxiety. I know that when my anxiety is high, even if I sleep 10hrs, I'll wake up tired and looking tired. But I think this medicine actually does a good job of getting rid of that anxiety, so your body can rest and get into some level of ""deep"" sleep.But absolutely, really only use it on the day that you must.",Joe9393

I developed insomnia as a result of having to take opioid medication for my CRPS/RSD in addition of the fact that I'm slowly recovering from the death of my best friend who passed in 2010. I have been on every insomnia medicine there is. My current regimen of the normal opiate and muscle relaxants, one to 1.5 grams of Keppra, 555mg valerian root, 10mg of melatonin, 25mg of amitriptyline, and adding up to 4mg of Ativan, depending on the next day's tasks.
