0,Clonazepam,Insomnia,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 29, 2022",0,"I was prescribed Xanax and then moved to Klonopin after a spinal injury put me in chronic pain, disability, and anxiety (from the pain and disability). The Klonopin definitely helped with me coping with my new circumstances but more so, it helps me sleep. I've had chronic insomnia my whole adult life and nothing touched it. I could be up for several days at a time, out of nowhere, and with no clear underlying cause. It was so bad for my well-being. So every night I take .25mg for the last four years and I sleep soundly and can mentally function the next day. I've never abused it or needed to increase it. I do read terrible reviews about this drug. I had a very hard time coming off of Lyrica and I suppose coming off of Klonopin will be similar. And I'm sure it's possible to build a tolerance to it that makes it not work anymore. But it has worked for my insomnia, my muscle spasms from the spinal injury, my anxiety and I haven't had any issue with it.",Long suffering
1,Clonazepam,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 13, 2022",0,"Was on rivotril (so far as I can tell clonazepam) 2mg daily for 3 years.  At first it was a God send.  I slept wonderfully every night.  That is until the end of last year (2021).At about this time my family and I started to notice I was struggling to recall words and form logical connections.  I looked up the side effects and mental lethargy was there.  After my dr told me to continue the drug, regardless of the side effect, I stopped taking it cold turkey (I wasn't warned.  DO NOT DO THIS).  After getting through the withdrawal I had my brain back but also my insomnia.The worst is after all that I'm back on 1mg daily (for a month) of the stuff for insomnia as my dr won't prescribe me anything else and I write this at 1 in the morning unable to sleep and found this website.Honestly the side effects of this drug are nightmare fuel aplenty and while I wish none of them on anyone else I'm done with it",Onyza

6,Clonazepam,Insomnia,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 17, 2022",4,"I will rate it at 7 as it has some negative effects on me. It's very much addictive and anyone who takes it for some days he/she must be dependent on it. Once started, one can not withdraw this. If withdraw, one can not sleep without it. But, it work like a magic. I can sleep without any break at least 5-6 hours long. It improves my overall sleeping behaviors. But, I repeat, it's very dependant on medicine. If anyone misses a dose, he/she can't sleep that day.",yrmishu
7,Clonazepam,Insomnia,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 24, 2021",19,"After trying pretty much everything at different times - Melatonin, Meditation, Hypnotherapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, CBD, 5-HTP, Seriphos, Ambien, Alpha Stim, and a combination of Apigen, Magnesium and L-Theanine I discovered Clonazepam. I found that CBD which if taken in high doses will send me to sleep (although with short term memory loss and next day ‘hangover’). Ambien just made me feel really weird, dizzy and hallucinating, whilst not really improving my sleep. Apigen, Magnesium and L-Theanine occasionally work but it’s a bit hit and miss, and the other therapies make no real difference. I find that 0.5 mg-1mg Clonazepam, if taken an hour or so before bed usually relaxes me and takes away my anxiety, ensuring a restful sleep. For me the biggest concern is physical dependence, and so I’m careful not to take Clonazepam more than 2-3 times per week, unless I’m going through a particularly intense period of insomnia.",MarkB

Clonazepam works for me, I'm trying to get this new doc to prescribe more than half of a 0.5mg dose. I've also had burning mouth syndrome for two and a half years, it's honestly the worst thing, I've been on Lyrica, Endep and Mirtazapine, but none of them work, so am now coming off them all slowly, but not the Clonazepam, that I'm taking for as long as I can, I don't usually suffer any withdrawal symptoms coming off any meds, but I will take it as long as I can, don't see the point in suffering long hours staring at the ceiling just to prove I can go without!

11,Clonazepam,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 21, 2021",1,"Clonazepam ruined my family - it makes you crazy. I’m now facing divorce and my poor kids have suffered so much. Scarred for life. It was prescribed to me to help with mild anxiety and sleep to be taken as needed. I took thirty .5 tablets sporadically over six months. Very little by all accounts. But during that time I made terrible irreversible decisions out of irrational panic. I wasn't able to connect the panic as a side effect - it would come on as the last dose faded. The pattern only became clear when I stopped all together. Then came blurred vision, chest pain, and massive fatigue. Still dealing with this four months later. Please do not use this poison.",Roberto
12,Clonazepam,Insomnia,9.0,,"September 9, 2021",5,I take this two or three times a week it is the only thing that has worked for my insomnia. I would take it every night but I worry about dependency. On the nights that I do not take it I take 20 mg melatonin with 100 mg hydroxyzine (basically Benadryl) I was only taking the melatonin and hydroxyzine and still not sleeping very much. I was so grateful to add this medication I can sleep with taking only that on the nights I take it.,Anonymous
13,Clonazepam,Insomnia,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 24, 2021",5,"I first took Klonopin 0.5mg once daily starting in Oct 2018 for Anxiety Disorder/Insomnia and developed weird suicidal thoughts a few months later and stopped cold turkey (1-2 weeks of withdrawal was difficult) which I wouldn't recommend even with low doses. I ended up having to get back on it a few months ago in order to get off Ativan which is much harder in my opinion to stop due to its short half life (you crave it sooner). I have noticed that Klonopin crushes my anxiety and prevents panic but doesn't knock me out like it used to. I take 1 mg at night in two divided doses (half at 6 pm and the other half at bedtime). I sometimes take it with Zyrtec if my allergies are bad and I notice no issues the next day. Klonopin is a great drug if you USE IT WISELY. I have noticed some decline in cognitive function and mild libido effects, but nothing too significant. It will cause dependency and I have tried to taper down several times unsuccessfully but my anxiety/insomnia quickly comes back fierce.",Jack

16,Clonazepam,Insomnia,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 6, 2021",4,"I have been prescribed alprazolam (Xanax) for the about 12 years. It is a miracle drug for sleep! 1mg xanny a couple hours before bed and I sleep like a baby. I was given Klonopin's at the same 1mg dose instead, and I found it to be terrible to fall asleep with. The effects weren't nearly as calming as Xanax either. Klonopin is probably a better drug for people to take during the day to treat panic attacks, anxiety etc. Sure not everyone is the same, but it seems like a lot of others on this forum have had the same experience I have.If you are after a better night sleep ask for Xanax. Also be careful how much you use it too. Benzos can be addictive if abused or taken too frequently.",BobbyB0Jangles

21,Clonazepam,Insomnia,2.0,,"March 1, 2021",10,"This drug can be life-saving for some, but as everyone else has said, you do NOT want to start taking this medication unless you are REALLY in a bad spot. Dependence builds and then getting off them becomes next to impossible without a super long, slow taper, and even then, your anxiety and sleep will worsen as you get lower and stop, leaving you worse off than when you started. I've been on and off this med for a few years and I find it works for me better if I don't take it daily. I also noticed, over time, that it was actually starting to give me MORE anxiety, even when I'd try and up the dose for a few days in a row to catch up on sleep. Only take this medication with extreme caution. Get on something safer long-term, like an antidepressant. They're a much better way to deal with anxiety since benzos build tolerance and you'll always need more and more to get the same relief. Awful medications. Again, can be life-saving but long term, they are definitely life-threatening.",Brett

27,Clonazepam,Insomnia,9.0,,"January 13, 2021",16,"My doctor prescribed 0.5MG during a period of stress when I was finding it difficult to sleep or to function in public. It was hard to make decisions and even small problems threatened to put me into a state of panic. With Klonopin, I can sleep through the night and wake up feeling calm and rested. Often, I don't need to take any in the morning unless I am facing a particularly stressful day. After taking it every night for 2 months, I quit cold turkey.  For about three nights I hardly slept at all. It took two weeks to get back to a reasonable state of normal.  No real serious withdrawal symptoms other than being exhausted and anxious from lack of sleep.  Definitely recommend tapering when getting off this drug.  I still use it off and on to help me get through stressful events or to get a good nights sleep.  But I am being very careful not to get hooked.

31,Clonazepam,Insomnia,10.0,,"November 9, 2020",127,"Diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety 2 years ago. Antidepressant helped with the depression immensely, but the anxiety still tended to come out at night.  Heard too many horror stories about Ambien and wanted to avoid benzos for the same reason.  Tried hydroxyzine for a month.  No results.  Trazadone didn't do much and left me feeling hungover in the morning.  Finally agreed to a low dose (.25 mg) clonzepam and it worked wonders.  Fall asleep fast, stay asleep all night, and don't feel drugged up in the morning.  Knowing I have something that works has helped ease the anxiety that came with the fear of being up all night.  It's been about 5 months and now I don't need to take it often - I'm due for a refill tomorrow and 3/4 of my script is still there. But on those nights I feel the racing anxiety it's been a nice security blanket to have on hand.

I have nocturnal epilepsy which causes nightmares, daytime sleepiness, and anxiety. This drug was prescribed because it is supposed to help all of those. It made me insanely tired when I would take it. I couldn't function afterwards and would fall asleep. The worst part were the dreams. Naturally if we sleep 8 hours it doesn't feel like 8 hours. On Klonopin I felt every single second of the night. It was awful and miserable. In my dream I would walk around a clothing store for hours and FEEL each material. If water dropped on me I would absolutely feel the wetness. Not in a good way. ALSO importantly, I am in college and normally drink quite heavily. If I took Klonopin I would become extremely nauseous and black out after a few sips. If you take this drug, absolutely do not drink while on it.",Kayla

I couldnt really get any help for the insomnia but once I was diagnosed with RSL (through a sleep clinic) this clonazepam was recommended by the consultant.  I started off with 0.5 mg a night and now 14 years on I'm up to 0.75 mg a night so not much of an increase.  For me it has worked both for RSL and insomnia. I sleep 'normally' unless I don't take it.
