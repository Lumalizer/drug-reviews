0,Olanzapine,Insomnia,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 22, 2022",0,Olanzapine (5mg) This drug has caused weight gain for me and constant shaking.  I was happy for a bit then just wanted to die. It does help me sleep but my moods are all over the place. Honestly if you don't have bi polar or schizophrenia try and stay away from it.  I can't go off of it because I need it.,Danish
1,Olanzapine,Insomnia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 4, 2022",3,"I have tried a litany of prescription sleep medications over the last 20 years.  A month ago, I started on Zyprexa 5mg.  It helped me sleep about 4-5 hours a night without the morning grogginess of Ambien.  I went up to 7.5 mg, and sleep is great.  I tried 10 mg for a week, but the hunger pangs were too much to handle, and my blood sugar was over 300!  On 7.5, my blood sugar is gradually coming down to acceptable levels.  I also have the extra benefit of being able to set aside my busy thoughts and live in the moment.  I'm loving it.  I hope this will not be one of those meds that I need more and more of over time.  Will report back in 6 months!  Meanwhile, Zyprexa is worth a look if other sleep meds haven't worked for you.",Will G
2,Olanzapine,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 17, 2022",2,"My only problem was falling asleep before important days before Olanzapine. The psychiatrist prescribed me 1.25 mg of Olanzapine + SSRI. I realized that my mood was exactly the same and the only difference was Olanzapine was making me sleep so well. The crazy weight gain was unstoppable. Since my doctor did not care about my concerns I stopped abruptly Olanzapine of 1,25mg. It has been 2 years and it caused permanent insomnia. My only problem was falling asleep before this poison and now my problem became maintaining the sleep. I see thousands of people suffer the same. If you are planning to use this for insomnia, just stay away from this poison. I believe psychiatrists are not aware the real risks of this drug and it may cause permanent damage. Just stay away from this thing. I lost my ability of sleep because of this, and eventually it destroyed my life.",Egg
3,Olanzapine,Insomnia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 16, 2021",0,I have been on this drug olanzapine for a year now and so far I love it.  I used to hear voices and could hardly sleep at night but this drug olanzapine together with amitriptyline have made my life better. My only issue is the weight gain and I'm afraid of getting diabetes due to prolonged intake of olanzapine. I don't know how to get off this drug (even though it seems to work okay with me)..it somehow causes a little bit of depression even though it's an antidepressant itself. Good luck to everyone reading this,Hjiok

I took a low dose for mild insomnia and anxiety, and after a while it turned out I can't stop taking it. I have tried tapering very slowly over many months, but it is a nightmare. I am now taking half the original dose, and insomnia and anxiety and heart palpitations and brain fog are through the roof. It's not temporary withdrawal, I've been at this dose for a year now.

7,Olanzapine,Insomnia,6.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 21, 2021",1,"I have been taking olanzapine for about 3.5 years now. Some nights I don't take it, other nights 2.5 mg, and other nights 5mg. It helps tremendously with my sleep when I'm intolerant to it. If my tolerance builds up, I might have to ""muscle out"" a few nights so that it it can then affect me better. These nights of having to go without it can be rough. For me, if not sure that I'll sleep at all, I find that taking olanzapine ends up being the better choice. I think sleep/calmness is healthier than no sleep/panic , even though olanzapine may some potentially unhealthy side effects. Speaking of the side effects, I have noticed it increase my appetite, but I can still control my weight. There is some drowsiness, but I don't mind it because I at least feel well rested. I do want to eventually quit due to long term potential side effects, but it is hard to get off I must say.",Adam

I've tried herbs and drowsy antihistamines but they didn’t work, my doctor suggested trying Olanzapine before trying a benzodiazepine. I was prescribed 5mg, my doctor said try one when I couldn’t sleep. So one night when I was lying in bed from 9pm to 3am and couldn’t fall asleep I tried one Olanzapine, and by 4am I was so tired and fell asleep pretty quickly and slept 10 hours. If I hadn’t of taken Olanzapine I would of been up for the remainder of the night and all day.

I started out at 5mg then increased to 10 and I felt drugged. My depression worsened and I started having anxiety and panic attacks. I’m now at 2.5 mg. My doctor used this as a sleeping pill which only worked moderately. Use this pill with caution. If you aren’t bipolar or have a severe mental illness then stay away from this drug.,Chris

After the first night I noticed quickly that I only needed half a pill 1.75mg. 2.5mg knocked me out cold and I had a hard time getting up to pee midway through the night. Next day was sleepiness and fatigue that is only comparable too high doses of Lunesta or Ambien. I also had a hard time with thoughts and speech. When I tried half a pill the next day was much more tolerable. Good luck with this med if you are given it.,Austin

It will help you sleep for a little while, then your sleep will get worse with time, then you will not be able to sleep without it once you try getting off. I'm going on 3 and 1/2 weeks off it after a slow taper and it has destroyed my sleep cycle. It's also left me with worse depression, anxiety, and exhaustion (all things that were starting to worsen after a few months on this med). Trust me, if you're not bi-polar or schizophrenic, do not take this medication, especially if you're just using it for sleep. You will regret it.",Brett

I went from having disrupted shallow sleep for a couple hours every night to sleeping through the entire evening, waking up after 8-9 hours feeling rested without any side effects aside from some very mild daytime sleepiness which is a trade off I'm more than willing to accept right now.

I have nothing but praise for olanzapine -it gives you a peaceful calm feeling allowing you to get natural sleep. No after effects at lower dosage. 5mg is enough for a 13 stone man in my case.

22,Olanzapine,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 27, 2020",49,I had a misdiagnosis of bipolar and I'm sure the insomnia started around the time I tapered off it. I was on it for over a year and the insomnia has lasted for 2 years. I'm frustrated that I see other people here have had bad experiences and the side effects are similar and had bad withdrawals but the Doctors never validate me when I ask if Olanzipine was the reason for this chronic insomnia or take responsibility that the reason you are still sick could be the drugs they prescribed and not down to poor sleep hygiene. I've now gone private but I doubt anyone will ever tell me the truth and more drugs will be prescribed to combat the problems they were the cause of in the first place. All I needed was therapy which I got eventually on the NHS but the legacy of the misdiagnosis and all the powerful drugs has ruined my life and I can't even work. I don't even have a mental health diagnosis anymore apart from insomnia.,hollydaze

He got off of it 4 months ago and his insomnia was so bad that he went 4 months with hardly any sleep at all.  Doctor prescribed hydroxyzine for his insomnia but it didn't work.

Over time, though, I started having diminishing returns at even 10mg, along with feeling like I was becoming dumber (having trouble focusing, trying to remember certain words)... It just made me more foggy and depressed. Decided to get off it and didn't realize til a few days after that I was having bad withdrawals (nausea, anxiety, worse sleep). I would not recommend this med. I'm trying to conquer my severe depression and poor sleep and this is making everything way worse. Even cutting to small pieces to taper is hardly helping.

So the issue I was so scared of was weight gain. When I started taking it I was 80 pounds, very sick and unhealthy. It helped me gain back my normal weight, back to 100-105lbs. Other than when I first started taking it, it hasn't had an effect on my hunger or weight anymore. I think it can cause weight gain if you allow it too. If you exercise, and eat normal weight gain shouldn't be an issue for you.  The reason I rate this a 9 is because it does make it hard for me to get up and going like I used to prior to taking this drug, but I'd pick that over a sleepless night any day.",Cwilson

Once on Zyprexa, most people cannot get off it without major side effects. Psychiatrists call this discontinuation syndrome, but for lay people, it is no different than withdrawal.

Started at 2.5mg, then 5mg, & eventually 7.5. It did take a long time to kick in though, so I had to take it 2 hours before bedtime. But like everybody who takes this, I gained weight. But I found the 1 way you can actually lose weight on this drug, which is to combine exercise with Atkins diet (low carb). Zyprexa gives you metabolic syndrome. You no longer burn carbs, which means all carbs you eat becomes body fat, which is why you become fat on this stuff (so you have to stop eating carbs).
