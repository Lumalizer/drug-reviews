1,Mirtazapine,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 9, 2022",3,"My experience with Mirtazapine 15 mg has been wonderful. I switched to it for sleep aid after Lunesta started to lose its effects. I suffer from anxiety disorder as well as depression, and let me tell you…I didn’t take this medicine to help with those disorders but man did my anxiety and depression decrease. I’ve felt ‘normal’ these past few weeks and the only change is from switching to this drug. It’s such a wonderful feeling to be myself again. I have noticed a huge increase in my appetite (it’s mostly sweets), but I’m a petite individual that has always struggled with gaining weight. So it comes as a hidden blessing. My sleep is also really good! If anything, I think it’s working better than Lunesta did. The only negative thing I can say is that I started to have really bad night sweats, but it’s not listed as a side effect.",Alice
2,Mirtazapine,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 5, 2022",6,"I have been on 15mg at bedtime for 10 years. I take this with 10 MG of Lexapro. I tried countless medications to help with crippling GAD. I was not able to sleep, lost a lot of weight, cried all the time.  It was a horrible year and half. I am 60 and have been this for 10 years.It is true all meds work different on everyone. Just don't give up hope finding a combination that works. You will find it! It also helps to find a support group if you can so you know you are not alone. Never think for a moment God had abandoned you. You will be able to help someone and bring hope to someone else. It is sooo hard but keep trying to find what works for you.",Betterdays

4,Mirtazapine,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 19, 2022",4,I have tried every sleep med imaginable. Even benzodiazepines were offering minimal relief. At most 2/3 hours a night. My psychiatrist suggested I try mirtrazapine 7.5mg. First night I slept 5/6 hours waking a few times but able to go back to sleep. First morning I had a hangover  feeling for half the day. By the third night I take the pill about 9 and have no clue what happens from 9:30 till 5/6 am. This med was a huge help! I keep reading side effects and reviews a few days before I took it scared of the side effects. Haven’t had any other than feeling a little hungry in the morning. It’s been two weeks on it and I feel so much better. Don’t be afraid to try it.,Rae1776

I take 7.5mg every night and fall asleep within the hour. I have a restful sleep and wake up feeling refreshed. I’ve had no side effects on this medication. It does knock you for 6 when you take it the first couple of times but your body soon gets used to it. I will most likely take this medication for the rest of my life.",Jasmine

I felt very irritated and anxious, and felt very very bad. The next day, the irritation and aggression continues. Trust me it's felling horrible!!

8,Mirtazapine,Insomnia,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 17, 2022",2,"I was prescribed mirtazapine 15mg for 3 days, and unfortunately had to stop taking it because I had an allergic reaction (which my psychologist said was very rare and she was surprised, since I don’t have any other allergies). However, the 3 nights I did take it I got the best sleep I’d had in months. It knocked me out within 30 minutes of taking it, slept 25 hours the first night. Took half a pill the 2nd night and slept for 12 hours. Last night I took 1/4 a pill and slept 9 hours. Alas, I woke up with redness and swelling around my eyes (like a red raccoon mask) and was told not to take it anymore. Since my reaction was rare, I’d still very much recommend it for anyone with insomnia.",Brib
9,Mirtazapine,Insomnia,5.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 5, 2022",4,"I have been on mirtazapine for about 6 years. I was taking it to help me with anxiety from PTSD and for insomnia. I have never slept so good except for the occasional nightmare, and it did eliminate the PTSD the only problem is that now I cannot cry I do not feel any negative emotions at all. I lost the ability to cry or feel any sadness or fear. The other problem is that I gained a lot of weight I went from weighing 140 to now weighing 196. My dr has weaned me off and I am no longer going to be taking them. I am now worried about whether or not I will be able to sleep without the med or not ever going back to feeling my feelings or worse feelings everything all at once. Only time will tell. I thought I would share my experience in case others are also noticing the same issues. I knew something was wrong with my emotions I just didn’t figure out that it was the medication until I started researching the effects in test studies. Next time I will do that first. Good luck",Mili

14,Mirtazapine,Insomnia,1.0,,"December 3, 2021",1,"After trying to work through adrenal fatigue  I had started on doses of supplements, diet change, cut out coffee, part of this was the absolute inability to slow my brain for sleep. I was a month of no or 2 hours 4 hours. I took a break from work. I was prescribed  mirtazapine for sleep and in part for anxiety I was experiencing due to this massive handbrake on life. I was in full flight mode, and it was a terrifying call to review my life, and it happened very quick. I was studying, working full time, saving for house, a breakdown inevitable. After 5 days, 15 mgs I noticed feeling blunted and anxious, it gave me same sleep, but a dirty/wakeful/anxious sleep. After 10 days on 15 mg, I halved it, then just stopped for couple of nights. I'm so glad I didn't persist. I tried melatonin 2 mgs. Best choice. Mirt made me feel disconnected, fuzzy and wobbly. Melatonin at lower dose best.

I was on Xanax and just wasn’t working as well after awhile, so I’m trying Ativan and it is worthless for me. I was given a starting dose of 30mg of remeron for sleep and it doesn’t seem to do a thing and still have to take extra anxiety med and Benadryl to get some broken up sleep! Will be calling Doctor to talk about what to do next. I’m also doing ketamine treatment for depression, anxiety, etc. I hope it will help eventually. I am noticing some small positive changes with the ketamine, also has been increased recently too, so fingers crossed! I have a 15 year relationship that is in chaos, which is not helping I know, but doing counselling. I’ve always had trouble sleeping, but this is probably the worst it’s been in a long time.

16,Mirtazapine,Insomnia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 23, 2021",2,"I’ve experienced insomnia and anxiety for years. I prioritise psychological strategies, but some nights I just can't down regulate and sleep. I've tried Valerian, Melatonin, Valium, Trazodone and antihistamines - for me the cons outweighed the pros. Then I started on 15mg of Mirtazapine and it worked immediately - got 9 hours of sleep, then every night. I felt a bit more chilled out during the day too, no difference on mood. After about a month I increased to 30mg - no difference on anxiety/mood, but great sleep continued. I put on 1-2kgs in the first 2 months which I just couldn’t shake, so after about 4 months I trialled gently tapering off and alas my old friend insomnia returned. I lasted a few weeks before returning to 15mg and I’m so glad I did - sleep is back on track and I’ve even lost about 1kg over the last month. While not overlooking sleep hygiene, anxiety management strategies, balanced diet, and daily exercise, Mirtazapine has been a game changer. Hope this helps.",whirring_mind

Now I can only sleep about 5 hours a night. I also have to take imovane 2.5 mg at bedtime and again if I wake at 4 am. Would a lower dose of mirtazapine help?

18,Mirtazapine,Insomnia,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 19, 2021",0,"I was prescribed remeron for occasional insomnia (take as needed). I'm a 24 year old female and started struggling with sleep in 2019 due to tinnitus...every since then, I get insomnia flares when I'm stressed/have anxiety. This year, ever since the time change, I've had insomnia almost every night and have trouble falling/staying asleep. Remeron worked the first few nights, but after that, it stopped working. When it helped me fall asleep, I had the most disturbing nightmares and was waking up every 2-3 hours. Still takes me 3, sometimes 4 hours to fall asleep when I do take it. I also have the ""internal shakes""...I never even knew what that was or experienced it before until I started taking remeron regularly. So throughout the entire day, it feels like my chest is shaking. Super strange feeling. I'm going to stop taking it because it lost its effectiveness. Might be good for short term solutions.

19,Mirtazapine,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 17, 2021",4,"I was experiencing chronic insomnia for 6 months, each night I would wake after 2/3 hours of sleep and then just couldn’t return to sleep, no matter what I tried. Half a zopiclone would do the trick but I didn’t want to go down that route for long. It was draining the life out of me, having an impact on my day-to-day tasks and work, struggling to function properly, and as the insomnia continued my mental health started taking a hit. My doctor put me on 15mg of Mirtazapine, I slept well but I found the side effects too much - heavy-headed all day and increased appetite.So he put me on a dose of 30mg, and it’s been absolutely perfect. Apparently a 30mg dose has a slightly different response to the 7.5mg & 15mg. Sounds odd I know but true. I get 8 hours a night, and importantly even if I wake up, I quickly go back to sleep.I’m back to feeling myself again and I’m so thankful for Mirtazapine. I can’t recommend it enough.

21,Mirtazapine,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 29, 2021",8,"Mirtazapine is amazing for sleep. It’s the only antidepressant that actually increases REM sleep. The deeper restorative part of sleep. I was on low dose amitriptyline for sleep but with long term use there is a risk of dementia due to anticholernergic effects and also heart damage due to QT prolongation. Mirtazapine has none of these, and can be safety prescribed with ssri as it doesn’t increase serotonin but rather blocks certain serotonin receptors. Anyway, biggest risk is weight gain but I found I didn’t gain any, yeah you do get cravings at times but what I did was reach for an apple rather than a chocolate bar. The effect does reduce with time. If anything it forces you to eat more healthily. Take it a good 2 hours before you go to bed so you can get up in the morning.

For the past week, I have slept for a minimum of 7 hours of deep sleep a night and feel amazing. I had no idea that this was possible for me. I cannot believe this is how normal people feel every day! Very happy to have tried this medication. Friendly advice is to try this med when you don’t have any obligations the first couple of days if you need an adjustment period before the work week.

I had anxiety induced insomnia for the first time last Spring and didn't sleep for almost a month. It was rough and led to terrible depression. Started at 15 mg, went up to 30, combined with 100mg Zoloft until the depression cleared. Now am weaning off Zoloft, and am down to 7.5 mg mirtazapine about 1 hour before bed. Sometimes I take another 7.5mg if I get up to pee in the middle of the night but mostly the first 7.5mg works. I take about 3 mg extended release melatonin with it.

It did nothing, I stayed awake all night, but instead my memory was cloudy the next day, I was irritable, I was making bad decisions, snappy, angry and super miserable.

It felt really helpful at first - I frequently get 5-6 hours of sleep a night (or wake up at 3am to racing thoughts and be unable to fall back asleep), so it was amazing to sleep consistently for 8 hours a night, every night. I've only been on 7.5-15mg and felt like it took the edge off of my depression / anxiety (just from having regular sleep) but now I'm not so sure if it's really helping. I've heard that higher doses are recommended for depression/anxiety so ymmv (your mileage may vary).The one downside for me was that I craved carbs LIKE CRAZY. I'd be fine during the day then would binge eat 1000+ calories before bed. I couldn't buy snacks because I'd devour all them in one sitting.

42,Mirtazapine,Insomnia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 30, 2021",9,I've been on and off Mirtazepine a few times. At first it was great for sleep but be aware that the first time you take it the next day will be a complete right off but it will get easier over the next couple of days. Initially it didn't do much for my depression and the effects on sleep wore off after a couple of weeks on each increased dose. I am now on 60mg and it is no longer managing my insomnia but for the first time in my adult life I'm living with out depression. I do have bad days trying to manage impossible insomnia but no longer have to roll up in a ball hoping to die. I will press on and find something that eases my insomnia.

I went back to the doctor (crying) due to insomnia, I needed to sleep. I was taking temazepam with very little effect.I was prescribed 15mg dose of mirtazapine. The first night I had the best sleep, I was a little groggy the next day but nothing to bad. Got up at 8am.I am continuing with mirtazapine however have cut it back to half a tablet 7.5mg and it still helps with sleep. I am going to stick to this for 3-6 months and see how it goes and get my sleep back on track.I was skeptic with drugs to begin and googled a lot. However at the end of the day anxiety and no sleep won’t lead you down a good path so taking something at low dose to begin really is the only way.

94,Mirtazapine,Insomnia,5.0,,"June 8, 2020",40,"Well, at first I enjoyed taking Mirtazapine as I have recently developed sleep anxiety and had developed a negative association with bed and going to sleep etc. As it is soporific it helps with sleep at lower doses. It was incredibly sedating at first and whilst falling to sleep was something I wanted, this made me a bit concerned about the amount of sleep I was getting. After 4-5 weeks I had a slight increase in sleeplessness with my phased return into work in play. What I liked about this drug was initially it seemed to calm my brain activity down which reduced my anxious thoughts; as time went on though and I started to build up a tolerance, I began experiencing a feeling of arousal/adrenaline in my gut which was too distracting to aid sleep and anxiety for me.",Penny

Usually,  I take this early Friday night when I know I can take the entire weekend to sleep, because it's extremely strong.The only side effects that I notice when taking it like this is dry mouth and extreme sleepiness. I feel almost as though I'm drunk, and cannot function much while on it for the first 24 hours. Definitely try this if you have very bad sleep issues & can block off time to sleep. It would be very hard to function at all (even walk around) while on this medicine, though,  so take care.",NINA

My experience is I make sure that I get a good 8 hours sleep in order for this medication to work and I feel great the next day.  If I take this medication late at night and not get enough sleep, I don't feel good at all the next morning.  For me, it takes around 1 hour to kick in.  As for weight gain, I did gain weight when I first started taking this medication - about a couple of months.  Then it tapered off and my weight stabilized and was back to normal.  If you're taking Mirtazapine and sleeping for only 6 or 7 hours, you will not feel good the next day.  I have been taking Mirtazapin for 6 years no complaints",Lin

Because it messes with your H1 system you are constantly hungry, all day long. No lie.

Also, it has a long history of making people want to eat compulsively in which you gain weight - the med itself does not make you gain weight. Again, the less med you take the less the compulsive eating side effects. Mentally- I just feel like me, I’m calmer about things and feel more capable of doing things, and it’s hugely helped with movement disorder.

I will say though that Mirtazapine makes me sleep like a baby as in sometimes 12 hours +, and I won't take it if I have something important the next day because besides the long sleep it makes you sedated for most of the day. It also gives you a massive appetite where you can't seem to be full.

Also, two words: WEIGHT GAIN. I have been relatively skinny my whole life and can get away with eating anything...until I started taking this med. I usually only eat 2 decently sized meals a day and I'll be set for the entire day. My goodness, not with mirtazapine. It gave me a MONSTER appetite where I literally could not resist food. I gained about 25-30lbs in the two month span of taking this medication. If you take this, I highly advise you to buy a bathroom scale if you don't already have one. I am now back on Seroquel and its just as if I started taking it all over again as my tolerance to it has gone away. Now, my mood is much better and my appetite well controlled.",WWbedamned

I have sleep apnea and been using  a CPAP machine now for about a month. Prior to the diagnosis I was waking every hour. I am finding this medication helps me sleep more but there is side effects 1.

After a VERY unsuccessful 8-month attempt to live without anti-depressants I spent the last three years on a combo of Pristiq, Seroquel and Clonazepam. Additional stresses clouded the issue.  Pristiq definitely did not work for me as it lacks the anti-anxiety properties of its parent drug, Effexor.   Went on a small dose of Effexor two months ago, gradually working my way up to 150 mg.  Psychiatrist at a Mood and Anxiety Disorders Clinic added 15 mg of Remeron a week ago not only as a sleep aid, but because it is known to give the Effexor a boost. The effect was almost immediate and I am better than I’ve been in four years.  I’m waking up quite a bit at night because of the initial side effects of the Effexor, but I expect this will pass.

I am non to limited responder to Ativan and other benzos.Mirtazapine works great for me, I get 7-9hrs of sleep, but only when I use the 7.5mg orally disintegrating tablets from Aurobindo. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT use the regular tablets. They had very limited effect on me. Mirtazapine will cause some drowsiness if I do not get the full 9 hours of rest, or have to get up early.

There is no apathy no drugged feeling like SSRI can cause! I must mention that it took me about 4 weeks to feel clear headed taking mirtazapine! First 4-6 weeks I did feel zombied, but better then the zombie feeling one gets from poor sleep! There are also zero sexual side effects! Only problem I experienced is i gained 7 lbs in the 5 months but the weight gain stopped, I work out and it stopped the weight gain",Izn

416,Mirtazapine,Insomnia,6.0,,"April 22, 2012",21,"Was prescribed Mirtazapine for insomnia and mild depressive symptoms, started on 15mg which initially helped with sleep but wore off in about three weeks. Felt no change in the depression after four weeks either. Was moved up to taking 30mg a night which would make me sleep for 12-13 hours and make me feel hungover when I awoke. Also put on 10lbs in the first four weeks, which I am not happy with, it does help with the sleep issues though.",Bee91

I started taking it to counterbalance my ADHD medication so I could sleep at night. However I stopped taking my ADHD medicines and I have noticed weight gain. I'm assuming its a bit of both medicines though. Also, the drowsiness is becoming a big issue as I am sleeping through my 9am classes and I have a hard time getting awake for a long period of time. I do however love that I can sleep through the night and fall asleep fast, which has always been an issue for me. I also love the vivid dreams!",Anonymous
418,Mirtazapine,Insomnia,9.0,,"March 5, 2012",59,"For years I suffered from anxiety attacks, depression and severe insomnia. I was prescribed many different drugs in the past but nothing helped me sleep. I was started on 30mgs at bedtime. It helped me sleep a bit better but still not all night. After 1 month of taking 30mg of Remeron my doctor decreased dosage to 15mgs. Amazing. A full nights sleep. Waking near sunrise! What a gift! The increased appetite was much worse on 30mgs. Since the dosage is now 15mgs the increased appetite is not nearly as bad. My anxiety attacks are few and far between and I don't feel groggy when I wake now. In the beginning I did. I have been on the medicines for about 4 months and am very happy with it. Just wish a doctor had prescribed it to me a long time ago. Best of luck!",Happily Sleeping

Found it wasn't effective at that dose beyond a week or so and reminded me of trazodone or doxepin.

Immediately stopped my anxiety. Drawbacks are increased appetite and after prolonged periods of consumption it can affect your blood pressure regulation, mostly noticeable when you stand up fast. Excellent for stopping the racing thoughts. It can be difficult waking up in the beginning but this gets better with time. It also suppressed my sex drive. All in all excellent for those who have tried everything, gotten hooked, suffered withdrawals from the ""pines"" and need something for sleep.",Anonymous
