0,Oxazepam,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 2, 2020",19,I take  oxazepam 30 mg at 10.00 pm and go to bed at 11.00. I immediately fall asleep and sleep perfectly till 7 am. I do this every three days to avoid dependence. Unfortunately the night after taking Serax I have  great difficulty getting to sleep. One good sleep every three days is OK for me.,Beetle
1,Oxazepam,Insomnia,1.0,,"May 27, 2020",7,"I had chronic & acute migraine attacks for 30 years 3-4 per week & used a variety of analgesics. Consequently my sleep was all over the place. Dr put me on one Oxazepam at night 10 years ago to help me sleep. I was unaware of problems with benzos until recently when I looked them up due lots of nasty & weird physical issues which surfaced when analgesics stopped 5 months ago. My fault I didn't know of benzo side effects - the patient needs to check out thoroughly any drug you're prescribed & I didn't. Finally  I found that my worst migraine trigger is yeast, so gave that up & hardly any migraines now so no analgesics at all. I am starting slow dry micro taper of benzo now as I am sure with some non drug strategies I can get my sleep pattern back. I'll be happy to get my health back too once I can get off the benzo.",Gypsy

6,Oxazepam,Insomnia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 5, 2018",15,"Poor english, sorry :  It's a good medicine for sleeping but not the best one. Temazepam is better. Oxazepam will slow down the thinking when you try to fall asleep. Oxazepam is helpful for those who have developed a tolerance to benzos. It's less addictive than Ativan ( lorazepam).  I take 20 mg every evening at 10 pm. When it will stop working it will be the end of the benzos  .",sirius1

8,Oxazepam,Insomnia,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 7, 2017",19,"I was very pleased with Sandoz brand that I was receiving from the VA.. Now the V.A. switched to some company that puts out the red capsules and they are terrible. About 60% of the red capsules are under filled, some have very little at all in them. I called my Congressman and the DEA about this problem and I haven't heard back from them yet. Yet, Sandoz's capsule have had the correct amount in them. I guess the lowest bidder decided to make up the difference by with-holding large amount of the medicine to get back what they under bid the other Pharma companies.    To the V.A. you are a sell-out to the USA Veterans and most likely the public also",US Veteran

11,Oxazepam,Insomnia,,,"June 21, 2013",66,"I have Tourette syndrome and get insomnia because of it (constant thoughts etc). I used to take Temazepam for 10 years but it was no longer working. I have now been on Oxazepam for about a 2 years and its remarkable. It helps me sleep no matter what I have been doing. 10mg is plenty for me, and if I have been drinking coffee, I take 20mg, have a shower then fall asleep within a minute of my head hitting the pillow. Super great for anxiety too.",DaveAustralia1978
12,Oxazepam,Insomnia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 13, 2012",86,"I was prescribed this medicine for sleep-maintenance insomnia. When I first started taking it, I found that 15mg wasn't enough since I had bad anxiety related to the stress of not being able to sleep and I still woke up for long periods. I took 30 mg, which was effective but I felt dopey during the day and had a headache for a few hours when I woke up. After taking it for 2 weeks, I now can take 15 mg and get a pretty good sleep with no side effects.",Anonymous
