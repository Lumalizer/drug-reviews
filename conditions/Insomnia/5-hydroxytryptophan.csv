0,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2021",0,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):Works for Cannabis-related insomnia when I've stopped smoking after prolonged daily use. After researching online and using on and off for a few weeks I use around 100-150mg depending on how tired I feel (recommend starting much lower ~50mg).  Very noticeable effect on sex drive so only tend to use it when I know that's not going to be an issue (If it's going to be a problem don't take it 2-3 days before and you should be fine).,Anonymous
1,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 29, 2021",2,"5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):Was recommended to take 5 HTP because I have no problem falling asleep, but rather staying asleep. Took 100 mg and slept better (still work up but it a much calmer way), but then next day after taking 100mg again I could tell it prevented me falling asleep and also elevated my heart rate to the point that I couldn’t sleep at all. Am going to speak to a doctor to ask whether it might work at a significantly lower dose. So many websites say 100 mg is fine and even say 200mg is ok to start with—I wish more recommended 25 max to begin, especially if you’re sensitive.",Anonymous
2,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 3, 2021",15,"5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):Solgar 5-htp 100mg. 1xdaily. First three days it helps with my insomnia, nice 7-8h sleep, but no change with anxiety or mood, then I started waking up at 3am sweaty with elevated heart rate and having very vivid bad dreams and it continued during the day with tension headache and severe anxiety and depression, didn't know 5-htp causing it so I continued taking it. Things get worst to the level that I  was stuck in dark mood and suicide feelings. I stopped taking them. 3 days later my system cleared and was back to normal. Some of us are sensitive to these "" brain chemical adjusters"".",Robb
3,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 8, 2021",5,"Will never, ever take again 5-hydroxytryptophan 100mg has given me near constant liquid diarrhea, numbness in the face, dizziness, confusion. Never again.",Rita
4,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 18, 2020",6,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):I have been using 300mg of 5 HTP at bedtime as well as Klonopin. It works for me. I have severe insomnia due to a problem with fibromyalgia. That being said. Go for it. The Klonopin alone didn't do it but the combo cocktail does. I feel like the quality of sleep is better also. My chemical complex is strange. I need large doses of anything to benefit.,Cheryl
5,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 21, 2020",14,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):Just a few comments regarding 5 HTP and Melatonin.  Often the actual tablet strength is the problem. The tablet strengths are insanely high.   100mg of 5 HTP is way too much and can turn you into a sleepy zombie but you don't sleep.  Melatonin is even worse.  A 3mg tablet of Melatonin is off the charts too much.  I crush a melatonin tablet and take a crumb or two and it knocks me out cold.  A 3mg tablets lasts me at least a week.  5 HTP is good at around 25mg however long term the zombie effect starts.   You feel asleep but you actually awake.   Hormones that affect your brain are in your body in extremely small quantities.,Grego
6,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 16, 2020",7,"I had a much different experience with 5-htp than most others here.I have had insomnia for years. Falling asleep and staying asleep.Back in early 2009 I started taking 100mgs 5HTP about 2-hours before I wanted to go to sleep. I found out Feb 2009 that my 52yo mother only had two months to live, lung cancer, and it was the most stress I had ever had to deal with.I strongly feel that 5-htp helped get me through that entire experience and allowed my racing brain to shut off and get restful sleep. I used it for years until 2012 and it helped me tremendously. I stopped it for some reason and my dr put me on Trazodone. Now I can’t take 5-htp while taking the Trazodone and I’m sleeping horribly and not handling stress at all.I’m trying really hard to get off the Trazodone so I can try getting back on the 5-htp.I used the Vitacost brand, by the way.Just wanted to share my experience with everyone. It’s worth a try, but it isn’t for everyone.",thf90
7,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2019",13,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):I've been taking 5-HTP 400mg for 2 months to try and help with insomnia and depression.  But I don't feel any different at all?  I don't understand it as other people have reported success so so I was hopeful for this stuff.,Sarah
8,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 19, 2019",7,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):I bought some 400mg high strength tablets after reading good reviews about 5HTP and knowing I have a high tolerance medicines.I took tablet around 8pm hoping to feel a bit drowsy by bedtime but it's 00:15am and I'm still wide awake even though I also took 2 zopiclone at 10.55pm and ran 13 km earlier and done a full 9 hour day at work today. I feel a little bit queasy in stomach but it's hard to say as I do have a lingering chesty cough right now too. Feel a bit anxious as I want them to work.,Trialling l
9,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,,,"September 2, 2019",21,"5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):Started taking 5HTP with magnesium. Had to get online as its not an approved drug in Australia. After 2 bottles I had to come off it as it was  upsetting my bowel. I started having panic attacks, depression,  insomnia. This withdrawal lasted 4 weeks. There should be a warning about coming off this med, be careful. Maybe this is why its not approved here.",Aries

11,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 10, 2019",21,"5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):Have been trying various doses (100 mg before bed - 100 mg 3 times during the day) of 5-HTP for chronic insomnia and it has made things significantly worse.  Agitated and utterly unable to sleep.  Even when I add melatonin, which has helped somewhat before, I am having terrible nights.Perhaps this is not surprising as Prozac 10 mg also made sleep impossible for me.Hoping this side effect will drop off if I continue, or lower the dose, but thought I'd share this for anyone else having a similar experience.",JL
12,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 5, 2017",13,"I have been unable to sleep for years and have tried everything from OTC to prescription without much relief. I read about 5 HTP (100mg) and decide to try it. At first it seemed to help somewhat, but not a dramatic change. I then added 5mg Melatonin and that seems to do the trick. I am sleeping a lot better, although not through the night. However, now when I awake I read about 30-45 minutes and then go back to sleep for the remainder of the night. I sometimes, also take another 5HTP. Overall satisfied with results. I am definitely sleeping better and longer.",Goochy
13,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,3.0,,"February 4, 2017",6,It helped me sleep at 1st for a few days and even slowed my brain down from racing thoughts but the past couple days its not been working. I have been up all night tonight as well as the night before. Also I have been having headaches that don't go away with ibuprophen. I am gonna try and only take 1 a day instead if 2. My husband got me this to help me sleep. What he didn't realize is I was sleeping it just took me a couple hrs sometimes. Occasionally maybe 10 times out of a yr I can't sleep all night. This is my 1st time taking meds and I don't know what to do. Ugh I am not happy. $22 down the drain.,Joyfuljennie86

15,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,10.0,,"August 17, 2016",46,"5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):I've struggled with sleep-onset insomnia for 15+ years. It started in my early forties when perimenopause hit. Tried 5-HTP recently and after 2 weeks I'm sleeping great! I take 200 mg time-release an hour before bed. Also drink milk/buttermilk before bed. And gelatin mixed with hot water and juice earlier. I only take Ambien or Ativan when I still can't get to sleep but that's unusual. Since I'm sleeping sounding again like when I was younger, my energy level is back to normal and I feel great again! I also changed my diet to low sugar/ high fiber. 5-HTP is a life saver to me!!!",Econut
16,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 26, 2016",57,"5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):I take 5-htp for both insomnia and anxiety .The benzos and other meds didn't work anymore . So I've started to take 100 mg of 5-htp at night with a bit (7.5 mg) of mirtazipine and bang , gone for the WHOLE night. Incredible. I was so happy after searching for a remedy for years. I've started to take some small doses of 5 htp during day time ( 50mg at noon) and my anxiety is down. Now I have to let go the ATIVAN slowly but surely for my daily anxiety because it is now useless so I just have to figure out the right dosage and hope to use only this and nothing else for my sleeping problem and anxiety. ( don't forget the vitamin B6 to make it work better) So I went from a bunch of pills at night to almost nothing :-)",sirius1
17,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 25, 2015",33,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):I have a love hate relationship with 5 HTP. it has definitely helped me sleep in the past but after a while I build up a tolerance.

20,5-hydroxytryptophan,Insomnia,5.0,,"August 11, 2011",71,5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan):It works very well with my Ambien pills which have almost stopped working but can't sleep without (sounds familiar to chronic insomniacs I guess). I fall asleep amazingly fast (faster than at any time in my life) and I sleep up to 8 hours which I had forgotten about even on Ambien!I take only 50mg in late afternoon with food because I have a sensitive stomach. I wish I had tried this before.,Anonymous
