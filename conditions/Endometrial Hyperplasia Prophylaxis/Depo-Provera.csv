0,Depo-Provera,Endometrial Hyperplasia Prophylaxis,9,,"November 19, 2015",12,"I had hyperplasia last year, as well as endometriosis which I had surgery for. First I was prescribed the prometrium pills. Had great effects. Stopped taking that and was irregular again. Then I started bleeding and didn't stop for 36 days, and it was heavy. We decided on the shot because I wanted added birth control. I suffer from bipolar disorder and anything with estrogen is horrid. 2 days after the shot I stopped bleeding! Some mild cramping, a bit moody and weird dreams but overall great! I think it works best if you are lacking progesterone.",shelle11503
