0,Tramadol,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 17, 2019",27,"Tramadol is a God send for OCD. It works within an hour to calm anxiety, and to stop intrusive thoughts. My sister gave me one Tramadol for a back sprain. Never took another for pain, but have taken Tramadol for ten years for OCD.",Herdyou
1,Tramadol,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 30, 2019",22,"THE BEST DRUG IN THE WORLD.    I've been sober for 18 years. I was having major issues with unwanted thoughts and an inability to concentrate.   One day I got a tooth ache and I was prescribed tramadol. IMMEDIATELY MY MIND WAS STABLE. I COULD CONCENTRATE AND EVERYTHING. So I called a Psychiatrist I knew from my younger days and told him about this.  I also told him about studies performed proving how wonderful tramadol reacts to OCD. ""Rapid reduction in OCD symptoms....""  He put me on it, now I feel great. Like has been 100% better since 2013 when i started.   The only downside is if you don't have it and have to stop suddenly you get deathly ill. Its horrible. But Psichiatrists cannot just cut you off cold turkey.  The purpose of Tramadol CANNOT BE to get a buzz.  Thanks",disciple4lif
2,Tramadol,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9,,"November 24, 2011",72,"Tramadol has been a wonderful drug to help lower my obsessions. I suffer from OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder). My doctor is understanding and prescribes this to me to help me with my OCD. It isn't a cure, however does help. Tolerance does build up, however and I have to take breaks and get off the medicine and get back on it to get the same effect as before. Too high of a dose can lead to seizures.",Anonymous
