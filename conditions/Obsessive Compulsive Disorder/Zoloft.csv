0,Zoloft,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 12, 2022",1,"I had a mental breakdown, which I attribute either to late onset OCD or my OCD rearing its head. I couldn’t stop thinking and believing I had cheated on a homework in university 5 years ago, and wanted to get myself expelled from university. I had multiple people including a professor and academic advisor tell me it wasn’t cheating but I couldn’t stop thinking this. I had panic attacks daily until I went on Zoloft. I started on 25 mg of Zoloft and then went to 50 mg. Now if those obsessive thoughts start crawling into my mind, I can just brush them away. This medication probably saved my life, because I was getting to the point of considering suicide. I had zero side effects with this drug.",Mary
1,Zoloft,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 29, 2022",1,"Pure O, absolutely unstoppable tides of intrusive thoughts and ideas that would cause me to obsess over my health, checking constantly to make sure I wasn't developing or coming down with XYZ disease, mental or physical, you name it. The anxiety it would induce was so bad my psychiatrist first prescribed me xanax up to 3 times a day along with 50mg sertraline. I would say it took me a full month to feel better with it, which sucks because it meant dealing with the obsessions a full month, but once they kicked in: wow. I didn't even notice 3 months had passed without another anxious break or pure O flareup. Obviously ERP was also a huge help but I don't think I would've been able to beat OCD without it. So yeah, the only con I'd say is the time it takes for it to really kick in, a quick search shows the median being around 2-3 weeks for most people. I think my pure O being related to health caused me to worry constantly and check for side effects which might have delayed it a bit.",EmilioT
2,Zoloft,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 18, 2021",10,"I've come to the realization over the past year that all my life I've struggled with OCD. Intrusive thoughts and obsessive behaviors have just been something I've grown to accept without knowing it. Prozac made me way too anxious and I gave up and thought I just wasn't meant for SSRIs. I was prescribed Zoloft a few months ago and it was the perfect fit. It took a while for me to find my perfect dose (150mg), but now I am a completely different person. Of course prescription meds are only one part of the equation (in addition to diet, exercise, therapy, etc) but this was a miracle. I'm writing this to say to anyone who is curious about medication for OCD or anyone who is struggling in general, there is hope and if you are patient you will see the light and find something that works. Give it time, it took me over a month to get it just right, but it was so worth it!",Joel
3,Zoloft,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 21, 2021",2,"I have had a life-long anxiety disorder coupled with moderate OCD. A couple of years ago, I spiraled and became worse. The tipping point was dealing with mild DP/DR due to excessive anxiety. I avoided dealing with my anxiety head-on especially, as I didn't want to get on medication. Finally, I came around to it earlier this year. I titrated up over 2 months from 25mg to 100mg, which I'm currently on.Like many comments have indicated, it takes time, and you could need up until 100mg dose to feel better. Some of my early side-effects included mild insomnia, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. In retrospect, I would have gone on this medication sooner. You don't have much to lose if you're desperate. It could give you your life back. It has for me.",Zoloft Daddy
4,Zoloft,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 15, 2021",9,"It has taken me 2 years to have the courage to write this post. I was incredibly desperate to find help for significant OCD (scrupulosity form mostly, among others) and at my worst was desperately combing this page looking and hoping for answers. It was terrifying. I had indications of OCD throughout my life but had some triggers 2 years ago that left me spiralling. I was very afraid to take a high dose of Zoloft and should have increased much faster. My first therapist did not get it. I then found someone on the OCD foundation website who was a godsend. The combination of working with her on ERP and 100 mg Zoloft has me happier than I’ve ever been. It took about 4 months to see a significant difference. I have virtually no side effects. Zoloft got me out of the thick of it, but my therapist brought me back to my best self. Overcoming Intrusive Thoughts was also a great read. Please know it’s a tough road but it’s worth it and you are not alone. You can get through this.",Anonymous
5,Zoloft,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 3, 2021",9,I started Zoloft after a period of stress led to me having a mental breakdown that led to weeks of crippling existential angst and depression. Before this I was studying at university and was extremely into bodybuilding and fitness. I would describe myself before this first breakdown as being a very happy person who definitely was highly strung but nothing severe or that I would classify as anxiety. After this mental breakdown occurred I was left devastated. I lost 10kg of muscle and I couldn’t eat or be bothered to look after myself. I started Zoloft at 50mg reluctantly and continued to live but barely existing. After a horrible couple of months of side effects I just woke up one morning feeling normal. The things that plagued my mind just disappeared and didn’t matter anymore. I felt myself again. This drug allowed me to save my life,Average Teen

7,Zoloft,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,,"August 6, 2021",134,I read these reviews over and over again to calm myself with what I was going through. Although thinking back it might of been obsessive. I have been taking this since December of 2020 when I had a bad mental break down where I was crying for a month straight couldn’t work and was having panic attacks all day everyday! This medication has saved my life! I could not stop thinking these obsessive thoughts everyday all day. That absolutely drove me up the wall crazy. It took about a month or two to finally start getting back to myself again. I am able to work again and able to take care of my family! I have happy moments now. Instead of always being in an obsessive thought and trying to get rid of it I can now accept the thought as a thought or yeah maybe that could happen and go about my day. Please don’t give up on this medication. The side effects do subside and you’ll feel like yourself again I promise!,xxmorgixx

9,Zoloft,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,,"July 22, 2021",62,"I have OCD, and honestly, this medication has given me my life back. This was the second med I took; lexapro was horrible for me. I have been taking Zoloft for 3.5 months. I was also seeing an OCD therapist through NOCD. You will definitely see better, faster results if you use this medication in conjunction with therapy. I first did have some negative side effects: GI upset, increased moodiness, fatigue, etc. this lasted for 8 days, and with dosage increases I also felt wonky for a few days. I also LOST weight, which was an added bonus. :)Please know this med is not a magic pill, it does take time to work which can be terribly frustrating at first. But WOW, I cannot tell you what I different place I am in. I just feel like myself again. I do still have intrusive thoughts, but I am ruminating much less and I no longer give these thoughts attention. My anxiety is significantly less and I am just so much happier.

10,Zoloft,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 29, 2021",80,I was just recently diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder a few months ago. I developed a strange form of OCD in which I engage in mental compulsions and have to repeat the same words in my head to relieve anxiety. A little after a week and I’m already noticing SUCH an improvement of symptoms. I don’t feel so overly aware of everything and the best part is that I can focus at school!! I was studying for an exam yesterday and I could digest every word without my thoughts screaming at me or distracting me. It really feels as if a switch went off in my brain. My thoughts are so much more positive. This medicine has given me my life back.,Emiwis

At about 17 years of age I started off with fluvoxamine for about 2 years I was okay, then it started to come back so the doctor eventually increased my dose from 50mg to 100mg.  I felt better for 6 months then again increased from 100mg to 150mg and so forth up until I reached 300mg. I saw a new psychiatrist and he changed it to fluoxetine went for months and didn’t help then I was put on clomipramine for months also didn’t work.

I had rituals I had to follow and I was super obsessive and that was leading to severe anxiety and depression. Zoloft helped me so much as far as changing my state of mind.

For the first 8 months everything was great, I didn't have any OCD thoughts or obsessions and it felt like my life was back on track. Unfortunately, the drug stopped working in December 2020. I'm not sure why it suddenly stopped working but I just woke up one morning with my mind scrambled with OCD. I thought it might go away on its own but it hasn't. I'm really depressed and distraught.

15,Zoloft,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,,"January 3, 2021",108,I had a random thought one day that has felt like it destroyed my life. I had the worst thoughts imaginable and it had gotten so bad to where I had to take a leave of absence at work and could not stop crying. I had thought about committing myself because I felt like I was losing my mind. I started working with an OCD therapist that confirmed I had Pure O. It helped me by doing ERP and ACT that I was able to go back to work and manage to live life. I was still struggling everyday and meditation was my only way to calm myself. I'm on Zoloft 25mg now. I have had no side effects. I noticed being able to see my thoughts clearly and distinguish what’s real and what’s in my head now. I am enjoying life and feeling more happy in every aspect. I still get thoughts but they don’t bother me since I don’t feel the need to ruminate or find out what’s true anymore.

Then I started to feel slightly better, then upped the dose to 50mg. During this time, I felt the side effects all over again, and I believe now it's just levelling off, and I finally feel a shift again, where I am able to appreciate things more, laugh more, etc. The  obsessive thoughts aren't gone, but they are way more manageable and I don't ruminate on them nearly as much.",Sam

I am on day 25 and I feel awful!!! The mornings are the worst. I feel jittery and emotional. I have to take xanax to even function. I have had this weird pressure and tingling in my head for about 10 days and I wake up 4 times a night in a sweat. With my OCD I, of course, thought I must be dying.

Consistently (at all doses) I find that it has helped alleviate obsessions, as well as the anxiety and distress associated with the obsessions. Thus far I have found the best results when mixing a medium dose (~100mg/day for a 200lb male) with exercise and CBT. I’ve found 50mg doesn’t help me very much with obsessions but it does help with some of my GAD symptoms; 200mg w/ CBT alleviated almost all major obsessions, but the dose was too hefty and I was struggling with side effects such as energy levels and fatigue.

It's important to combine therapy and medication, OCD is more practice, accepting and dealing with thoughts, than drugs, but the drugs helped a lot! I accepted my obsessive thoughts and the monster kept getting smaller and smaller. Sometimes had side effects, but minimal (sexual side effects and dizziness), but they go away after some time. Zoloft gave me my happiness back, but it was the ERP, CBT and ACT that helped me LIVE WITH IT. It's important to seek help with psychiatrists that are specialized in Anxiety Disorders.
