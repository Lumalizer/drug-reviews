The more successful I became at life, the more I got worried. It affected my work a lottttttt. 2 years ago, my worries increased and I started having panic attacks and anxiety everyday. I was miserable and thought I’ll go crazy. Started using Paxil and then lamotrigine. My life started changing gradually to the better and I started feeling the best after around 6 months of taking the medications. After suffering for around 35 years of compulsive thoughts, rituals especially before going to bed, wasted time on checking things around, I felt a different life. I won’t say I’m 100 percent OCD free, but 70 percent less would be fair. I was against mental medication whole my life. But now I would encourage patients to talk to doctors and see their options. God bless science!",NBN
1,Paroxetine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 10, 2021",8,"Paxil (paroxetine):This is the only drug that has helped my very intrusive thoughts subside. Not completely but MUCH better than where I was before. I spent months in a psych unit, taking drug after drug, getting ECT with no effect, and then suddenly I was prescribed paxil and a weight was nearly instantly lifted off of me. I felt like a good person again. I gained no weight on this drug, but have experienced little sexual desire. I also don’t clean as much (another symptom of my ocd) and that’s been a little hard on me. It also caused me to not be able to sleep at night but I’m now also on trileptal 900mg and trazadone 75 and that has helped a lot. I still need to be on another booster for my paranoia and am going to try a low dose of latuda but I’m much better than I was before with the help of paxil.",N0cturnalanimal

There were plenty of side effects such as sexual dysfunction, weight gain, increased apathy, drowsiness/tiredness and etc however most of them have subsided after quitting the drug and the withdrawal was not that bad either because I tapered slowly.",OrandomCnicknameD
3,Paroxetine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 11, 2021",3,"Paxil (paroxetine):This drug can do a lot for people with depression and maybe anxiety but it does not help OCD. I took it for 6 months and while my mood was great, the ocd was still very severe. I ended up weaning off of the drug very slowly since it wasn’t doing much, and it was the worst nightmare I’ve ever experienced. Not only did by ocd/anxiety come back tenfold, but I started getting severe hot flashes, night sweats and suicidal thoughts. My doctor told me as long as I eat healthy and get exercise, the withdrawal symptoms will start to dissipate. However, after 8 months of being off this drug now, I am still going through severe withdrawal and will most likely have to go back on SSRIS again at the end of the month. I would advise anyone with OCD or even depression for that matter to stay away from this drug, because you’ll NEVER get off it",Fidog

My doctor told me to use half of 20 mg dosenevery day for one week and after that take a complete 20mg each day. I couldn't tolerate the complete one so I continued to use a half each day . It helped me with  obsessive thinking and anxiety but I also suffer from side effects such as constipation  and difficulties in orgasm . I tried to quit but I was awfully  dizzy For two days. Now I stated using it again. In fact it helped me in one way but ruined me in another way .Thank you paroxetine!,Dess

It’s been very effective at cutting done the thoughts which is a welcomed relief. I can’t tolerate high doses due to pains in the body. But was on between 20mg to 7.5mg over the course of 3 years. Then tried to stop and the thoughts cam back. Right now on 10mg and going back up with the doctors help. The meds, Exposure Response Prevention Therapy (ERP Therapy), and a 12 step group OCA have been effective in minimizing symptoms. Very little anaorgasmia but it increases as I go up on the meds. Don’t beat yourself up and give it time to work.  It’s a slow gradual improvement with meds. I felt different about 2 weeks,  and then every week after I improved.

17,Paroxetine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 26, 2017",15,"I suffered from BDD, and mental checking. I immediately began to have a reduction in obsessive thoughts. For 3 1/2 years I remained on paxil. Going as high as 25mg which was too high for me and gave me intestinal problems, not to mention wanting to sleep all the time. I finally got down to 12mg, then 10, then 7.5, which was good for 1 1/2, and then finally down to 5. I then made the big mistake of throwing the meds out thinking I had beaten OCD. Within a month and a half the anxiety, obsessions were back like never before. Now back on 10mg I feel like myself again. It's important to remember whenever you start or change a dose it's going to take a few weeks for your brain to adjust. I also take the med at night. All in all a God send.",Acceptance11

We're talking about nasty trips, confusion, dizziness, fatigue. You name it. I probably suffered it and more. The actual use of Paxil as a form of treatment has been hit and miss. By treating my OCD, I noticed my depression was getting worse. On days where my depression was better my Anxiety would flare up.

They only work to an extent and the side effects are intolerable. I'm taking Paxil long enough to hopefully bridge my way from the difficult place I'm in right now, to some place where I feel more confident and comfortable. This morning, the intrusive thoughts returned with renewed vigor. I took another 5mg and again, 2 hours later they were gone. It's surreal being present.
