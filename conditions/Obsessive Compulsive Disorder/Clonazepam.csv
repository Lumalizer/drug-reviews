0,Clonazepam,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 13, 2022",1,"Clonazepam is the only substance that has any effect at all on my severe obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) type 2 symptoms, besides cannabis. Clonazepam allows me to function like a normal adult with out OCPD at all. I would rate it at 100% effective. I am also ADHD and it treats those symptoms as well. My OCPD type 2 makes it impossible for me to take amphetamine based ADHD medication and I have not been a functioning adult for most of my life. Finally it has given me a full rich life, I run my own business and live off grid on solar power. Thank God this medication exists. A large enough dose of cannabis gives a partial decrease in symptoms while at the same time increasing the cognitive impairment symptoms while klonazapam does not. No other benzo works besides Valium which also puts me to sleep and defeats the point. Klonazapam acts on me like an amphetamine would act on a normal person. My brain must be wired reverse of other people. It's like it was made just for me.",Asher Gemler
1,Clonazepam,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10,,"February 26, 2022",3,"I've tried every SSRI, and even other meds like Anafranil which proved to have better results than any of the newer anti depressants; Also CBT and keeping a journal helps; but, from experience, I found out that Clonazepam or alprazolam are much more effective than anti depressants in treatment of OCD. I think this meds work better because while you still have uncomfortable intrusive thoughts (no med or therapy can change that, its just the way the brain is wired I think) but they effectively neutralize the anxiety caused by them and you're able to quickly dismiss them.",Anonymous
2,Clonazepam,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 25, 2022",0,"Works well for OCD intrusive thoughts and fears, usually 1mg for me, it is not a saviour drug and Valium competes quite well with it, but Clonazepam is just a little stronger for the OCD. Anyhow OCD is best treated by SSRI's and Therapy. I still think Diazepam fairs better for general anxiety than clonazepam, but for the OCD as mentioned Clonazepam is ideal although its not a ''cure'', I am giving this medication a 7",Peter245
3,Clonazepam,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 24, 2022",0,"Helps with flashbacks, dissociation and helps with OCD symptoms, usually take it when I relapse badly OCD wise, when I panic  or when waiting for an SSRI or antipsychotic to take effect",Pete
4,Clonazepam,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 20, 2021",9,"Clonazepam works brilliantly for my OCD and PTSD both of which cause me insomnia.  Before Clonazepam, my thoughts wouldn't stop.  With it I can relax and sleep.  My dosage is .5mg.  I usually take Lunesta as well to help me shut the lights out in my mind.",Anonymous

6,Clonazepam,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 1, 2020",8,"I take clonazepam .5mg as needed, generally 2-3 times per week for OCD, anxiety and panic attacks.  No euphoria; it just quietly begins working within 1-2 hours.  If I take it to help me fall asleep, I generally take .5 mg or .5mg + 1/4 of another tablet.  30 tablets costs me less than $2.  The only side effect I have is hair shedding.  Initially, when I was having severe panic attacks and anxiety, I took .5mg everyday for three weeks before I finally calmed.  Only side effect I noticed with daily use was depression could set in and I needed to increase my dose for sleep.  But after a few weeks I was able to alternate back to Lunesta and occasionally I have a night where I can sleep without either.  This should be an option for patients like me who don't tolerate the side effects of a daily SSRI and do not have addictive tendencies.",Random Task

9,Clonazepam,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 27, 2018",14,"I began taking Klonopin about a year and a half ago 1 mg twice a day for OCD and the crippling anxiety that tends to come with the disorder. Clonazepam has changed my life for the better yet it does have some potential for abuse, and I have found myself taking more than prescribed during times of high stress but have since stopped that bad habit and started taking a dose every other day as needed. It is extremely helpful for a plethora of anxiety related issues and is the least addictive and safest benzodiazepine that I have taken. (I've been prescribed nearly every benzo you can name). I would say you could potentially stay on Klonopin for a few years before you would have to taper down unlike xanax and ativan with their short half-lives and extreme abuse potential. The only side effect I've encountered was some short term memory issues that have since been resolved. Please keep in mind that Klonopin is still a benzodiazepine only take as needed!",Anxious Nerd

11,Clonazepam,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8,,"October 6, 2017",7,"works great, but you build up a tolerance, and now I need 5 times as much (2.5mg) to get the same effect as .5 mg used to give me. After 10 years.",robbie gerrie
12,Clonazepam,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10,,"August 24, 2013",69,"I have suffered from terrible bouts of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder my whole life. I have tried SSRI's such as Prozac and Luvox and at other times the supplement 5-HTP with good success. I wish a doctor had given me Klonopin earlier in life, however, because when I take 1 mg it is as though I have no OCD at all. I do not take it everyday because of its tendency to cause dependency, but I take it as needed. Roche has done a study showing Klonopin's success in helping patients with OCD while they wait for the SSRI to gain full-effect.",Klonopin removes OCD
