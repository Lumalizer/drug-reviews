0,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 9, 2022",10,"I was very nervous to try Prozac because of my horrible hypochondria and fear of trying new medicines. I was constantly struggling with OCD intrusive thoughts and compulsions, as well as TERRIBLE anxiety. I felt as though my OCD and being in a constant state of worry were taking over my life. I’m 29 years old, work full time & decided that this way no way to live. I caved and started 10mg daily. Week 1 I was exhausted and in a fog. Week 2 was brutal, I had peak anxiety and OCD. I almost felt manic. I had a panic attack, was nauseous, & couldn’t eat. Week 3 I started feeling better, I noticed my intrusive thoughts weren’t constantly haunting me. Week 4 I woke up one day and felt like a new person. I no longer have intrusive thoughts or OCD routines, irritability is nearly gone, and I’m not in a constant state of worry. I feel 100x better, Prozac has changed my life. I’m posting this for people who are nervous to try. Try fighting through the side effects, it’s SO worth it.",OCD and Anxiety
1,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 28, 2022",1,"It has helped so much. My OCD used to be horrible and awful to manage. Ever since I'’ve been on prozac, it’s been so much more manageable. The only side effects I’ve had is a dry mouth, dizziness, and a low sex drive. I’m on 30mg",ilua
2,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 25, 2022",9,"I recently started on Prozac for Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, OCD, Insomnia after cycling through a number of medications for several disorders. I tried trazodone at first for anxiety and insomnia, then added quetiapine when the trazodone didn’t work. Then I started using Imovane which made me feel awful. My psychiatrist started me on 20mg Prozac to improve anxious and obsessive thoughts and depression. It has significantly improved those and I no longer feel the physical effects of anxiety or depression. It has also significantly improved sleep as I do not stress about not being able to sleep. Finally, it did cause a few side effects like headache and nausea for the first few days but it is now gone.",searching

4,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,2.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 17, 2021",1,"Forgot to add to my other review. The generic equivalent of Prozac did absolutely nothing for me, either for my ocd or my depression. I needed the brand name for it to work. So if you’re not having an effect, ask your doctor to write brand name only . You better have great insurance though, because it’s thousands of dollars.",George
5,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,2.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 17, 2021",0,"Warning! Just be careful. I’ve used Prozac off and on for maybe 30 years. Be aware of sexual side effects of this drug. Total inability to reach orgasm during sex. And no, it wasn’t caused by anything else. I was checked out. Sometimes the inability to climax persists even after you’ve off the drug. I’m not the only one to experience this; there’s plenty of information on post SSRI sexual dysfunction. Oh, and the percentages  of sexual problems listed in the package insert are skewed on the low side.",George

I had an extremely rough time this summer.  Getting on these meds was rough but benzos helped me on bad days.  I just have to say, this medication saved my life.  I hope that this brings hope to whoever is reading this right now.  You can get better.  My anxiety is gone, depression is gone. OCD is background noise now.  I was terrified I would never get better. I was suicidial.  I am a mom of 2 kids.  I was deathly scared of my own mind.  Don't give up.  Give this med a shot! (I take 40 mg).",Abby

8,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 28, 2021",15,"30y/o F with moderate anxiety and very mild OCD regarding relationship, and PMDD.I just wanted to share a positive review, after reading so many negative ones listed below. I started on 10mg, and at 7 days, I doubled to 20mg. Other than maybe feeling SLIGHTLY ""dazey"" the first few days, I have had no other side effects. It has changed my life in just 3 weeks. Things are more vivid. Life is lighter. It almost feels like I'm constantly microdosing on mushrooms (if you know what that feels like)It got rid of the constant angst, the obsessive thoughts, the severe PMS symptoms. My sex drive didn't go away, if anything, it's even better because I actually like my boyfriend now, instead of the PMDD telling me I need to get out. It's a game changer, and it started working day 3-4 for me, with VERY minimal bad side effects. So thankful.",Positive Review
9,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2021",1,"It was ok, but I didn't really like the feeling. I took 20mg for a week and then I quit. I felt like I couldn't think as deep, which I guess could be good for those with OCD, but I just felt off and would rather feel normal instead of on a medication. It felt like someone filled my head with oatmeal and I had to think around the oatmeal. I slept less and the sleep itself felt artificial. I did have a few interesting moments on it, but overall I wouldn't recommend it and I don't see how people can take this drug for long periods of time. My face even looked different. It was just a strange experience overall. I'm glad to be off it.",jessie

I have depression, anxiety, PTSD and severe OCD with the intrusive thoughts.  Before Prozac I have battled with depression and anxiety for years but the OCD has just hit hard within the past year and a half. To the point of loosing my family and friends over it because I was constantly questioning and accusing and it was just awful. My family doctor wasn't giving me the correct medicine. I have tried wellbutrin, lexapro, effexor etc. and none of them were helping me, I just felt like I was getting worse. I started seeing a Psychiatrist and she diagnosed me with severe OCD and put me on Prozac. The first week I couldn't really tell anything, the second week I felt alive again, like a weight had been lifted off of me, thoughts were still there but I was able to dismiss them a lot easier. Week three I am feeling a little down and depressed this week but I am not giving up. The way I felt with week 2 I hope to start feeling more often and even better.",Girlygirl

I had been suffering for weeks with debilitating OCD/anxiety and depression, Having been SSRI free for over 4 months but it came back with vengaence. In essence, fluoxetine works! For those nervous about the side affects - the first time I took it the anxiety/OCD was seriously INTENSE and took 8 days to work. At points it felt like I was losing the plot. If it got that bad again this time I was planning on taking Xanax while it kicks in. However, I’m 4 days in now and the anxiety/OCD has been pretty bad but I was able to ride it out. It’s now Day 5 evening and I can feel it is starting to work again. Depression has gone, head feels clearer with no more anxiety alongside the intrusive thoughts.

He has had OCD since I’ve known him, almost 35 years, but in the last 6 months the symptoms have ramped up and he is tortured by thoughts of contamination. He recently found a psychiatrist who put him on Prozac. He is at the 8 week mark and has yet to see any benefit and in fact seems to have gotten worse. Everything we read says it needs to be taken for 8-12 weeks to begin to see improvement, but is it common for the obsessions and anxiety to worsen initially? He is discouraged and desperate for some relief. Is this anyone else’s experience?",HAZ
16,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 14, 2021",31,"I was dealing with chronic and miserable anxiety for months and was losing hope that I'd ever feel at peace again. Did 10mg Prozac for a couple days then increased to 20 mg for about a month. Didn't notice any differences, so increased to 40 mg for a little over three months. I noticed quite the change with that increase after a month or so, and was finding myself less anxious throughout the day and feeling a little less guilty all the time. Just increased to 60mg a couple days ago and am feeling quite optimistic. While I still have my bad days, I really think this has saved me and I am so glad I gave it a try. I was apprehensive at first because of all the horror stories I've heard, and being anxious about trying a more intense medication but I am so so happy to have begun this journey and finding that there is hope. I dealt with minor insomnia after the first month for about a week, and for a about a week after the first dose increase.",peace

18,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,,"January 10, 2021",76,"I’ve been on 20mg of fluoxetine for five weeks so far. I was terrified to start because I had a horrible experience with lexapro. My experience with fluoxetine has been a cake walk so far compared to lexapro. The first week or two were a little rough. I had difficulty sleeping, dry mouth, forgetfulness, and extreme exhaustion. Now at week five my intrusive thoughts have decreased. When I do have them, I can let them go. I don’t ruminate like I was doing prior. I’m also not having panic attacks when trying to do every day tasks like going to the store or driving. This medication is slow working, so it takes time to feel improvement. A lot of information says 4-6 weeks but many people in support groups that I’m in say it took closer to 12 weeks to feel full benefit and if this is the case, I’m excited to see how I’ll feel in a few more weeks because I’m already feeling so much better!

I couldn’t function like a normal person anymore and it was a very dark time for me. My doctor put me on Prozac and the first month I didn’t really notice a change. After the first month went by, everything got better for me. I noticed myself not worrying about OCD anymore and actually felt genuinely happy inside. It’s been 8 months on Prozac and I can honestly say I love my life now, I’m truly happy & OCD isn’t something I’m controlled by anymore.

Each of these medications drastically worsened my symptoms and I began experiencing suicidal thoughts (side effects of both). Naturally, I was too terrified to every try medication again. However, when I was accurately diagnosed with O.C.D., my O.C.D. specialist recommended Lexapro and it has changed my life (in combination of Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy). I experienced a mental and physical breath through and am thriving like never before. I literally thought feeling like this would never be possible. I have SO much mental energy now that it's not being used up for my obsessions and compulsions. I am forever grateful for this one tool. But I firmly believe it's just one tool, not the ""cure all"".

Compared to other medications that I've taken in the past, it has very few side effects, especially in terms of weight gain etc. Alongside therapy, it's changed my life.

He still has it, but compared to how it was -  the compulsions and tic like compulsions were almost unbearable. Then there was the hoarding! Since taking Prozac most of that has subsiding. He still hoards but it’s not near as extreme. He still has compulsions but it’s less and more manageable. My issue is, when we have periods and his OCD is ramping up, we have to increase and it seems like we have a honeymoon period and need to increase again. Also, for my husband, this medication was horrible. It did not work on him at all. He had better success with lexapro, but we were not trying to treat OCD with him.

I finally found the medicine that healed me. Before taking this medicine, I would do the most bizarre rituals including always selecting the right side of everything, touching objects repetitively, stepping on lines and more. The OCD was mentally draining. I will admit I have done exposure therapy alongside taking this medication, which has helped me tremendously. Have faith, this medicine is a lifesaver.

Panic attacks gone, my OCD is under control (also with help of ERP therapy with psychologist) it has completely changed my life. I almost quit taking it the first few weeks because the side effects were so terrible, but with support from my family and online support groups I kept taking it.

41,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,,"February 26, 2019",7,I started having really strong suicidal thoughts. I saw a psychatrist and he diagonised me with OCD and said there's no depression inside me I doubt it. He started me on Prozac and Risperdal. I struggled for 1 year long. I decided to change the doctor. He said not to leave Prozac and add one other medicine called effexor. I finally found out that only the brand Prodep Olimelt and Lamez ( Brand name of Prozac Zyprexa and Lamictal in Nepal) work best with each other. No other brands can be used.I am now currently on 150mg Efexor XR( Australian Brand) Prodep 20mg 2  capsules( Nepalese Brand) Olimelt 5 mg ( Nepalese Brand) and Lamez 100mg ( Nepalese Brand) and I am living a life. So if you are suffering from any mental just go to Nepal and ask a psych to take Prodep 20 mg capsule Olimelt 5 mg tablet and Lamez 100 mg Tablet( Remember lamez 50 mg tablet doesn't work well with this combo so just 100mg Tablet) doesn't matter whatever dose you are on.

She has since told me to stop coming so often because I am doing so well. Awesome. Prozac saved my life. Everyone around me has noticed.Some cons: I was a little nauseous whenever my dosage was upped and had sleep issues for a while, but they went away. In fact I actually have an irrational fear of vomiting and was very nervous about starting because of this, but the it was negligible at worst and, if I haven't said enough already, worth the brief amount of time I experienced it. The most noticeable issue was that it's significantly harder for me to achieve orgasm, but thankfully not altogether impossible. Please don't be afraid to try it out.",Hello

I’m 29 and have been struggling with the disorders my entire life. Only 20 mg of Prozac has lessened my suicidal ideation and obsessive ruminations significantly; of course, I still need therapy. I never increased the dose because I experienced some undesirable sexual side effects (desensitation, lack of desire), and I’m glad I didn’t because 20 mg works just fine. It does take a while, however, to notice the change. My doctor added 150 mgs of Wellbutrin to counteract the sexual side effects, which has worked. The combination has me feeling a whole lot better. The only annoying side effect that I have now is excessive yawning, but it’s a small price to pay.",Justagirl

After being on several meds in the next 10 years, which did not appear to work (although I wasn't on them for a long period to time) I decided to try Prozac from the advice from my psychiatrist, who is a very good doctor. I took a gene test to see what medicine would be best from me, and the tests revealed prozac would be best. I started off on 20mg, increased to 40mg, and eventually went up to 60mg (due to my OCD). At first, I kept the weight off, and in fact was losing a bit of weight. However, after being on 60mg for a long period of time, I decided to weigh myself, and was totally dismayed, and went into a deep depression, on how much weight I gained.

I had to try lots of other SSRI's before Prozac. Prozac took a long time to kick in, but all good things are worth the wait. I was definitely crawling before I walked again. I just want to say that I'm so happy Prozac was invented. It made me feel normal again. It's given me myself back. It didn't change me or numb me- it made me feel alive. I owe all my progress to Prozac in terms of OCD. I was on the verge of ECT.

63,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 26, 2017",950,"I don’t find a lot of positive stories about antidepressants, or I find stories where people are taking the antidepressant the wrong way.I wanted to share my experience.  A positive one.I’ve had generalized anxiety disorder, SEVERE OCD, and panic disorder for as long as I can remember.  My first memory of having an episode was when I was 4 years old at my kindergarten interview.  I feel as though I was born with the illnesses mentioned above, right from the womb.  When I was a child I was extremely anxious, had bad separation anxiety from my parents and had extreme OCD, I was just a kid and thought that the way I was feeling is how all kids felt, I didn’t realize that I was different.  This went on, and got even worse in middle school.  I began developing trichtilomania in middle school.  In high school I went from being a 90% above student, to failing every class within a couple of years.  I couldn’t leave the house.  My panic disorder and gad caused debilitating physical symptoms.  I would be shaking when I had to leave the house, I wouldn’t drink alcohol because I was afraid of vomiting, I was suffering so much, for my whole entire life with severe phobias, fears, and anxiety.  I prayed and prayed and prayed to God every night for it to go away.  I was a 16 year old living in a prison of her own mind.  It never went away.  Every single day was the worst day of my life, I would wake up and the thoughts just started,  I never had a break.  My life was exhausting.I am of east indian background and my parents didn’t understand mental illness well.  It is very taboo in my culture.  I went to tons of doctors and they told me it was just growing pains,  no doctor ever told me that maybe I should see a therapist.  I didn’t have any support.  When I was 22 I attempted suicide.  Luckily the attempt didn’t work and I was forced to go on medication.  I was livid, I was so against antidepressants, I was so so so scared, it felt unnatural. My general practitioner put me on Effexor, I took it for almost 8 weeks, it helped me to not want to kill myself, but It also made me gain tons of weight which made me depressed, and it make me hear voices.  One evening a voice told me to choke my mom, and I started freaking out and my parents drove me immediately to the hospital.  At the hospital I talked to a psych nurse who calmed me down, and got me an appointment with a psychiatrist the next day.  This appointment and this psychiatrist saved my life, and changed my entire life.I want to really mention that you should not be going to a General Practitioner for mental illness medication, you should ALWAYS…ALWAYS go to a psychiatrist no matter what.  If your GP is the only person you are seeing to help you manage your meds for ocd, anxiety, etc, that is the WRONG MOVE.  That is such a common mistake people are making, you NEED a psychiatrist in order to get the meds right, please do not just go to your regular doctor, you’ll be cheating yourself.I went to the psychiatrist appointment the next day.  It was the first time I had ever seen a psychiatrist.   I got into her room and we talked about everything, my childhood, my phobias, my ocd.  She then brought my parents into the room to explain the whole situation to them and the fact that I have a chemical imbalance in my brain and that I have been suffering for way too long.  My parents were so supportive.  The doctor told me I was on the wrong medication, that I never should have been placed on Effexor which is an SNRI, and that I should be on an SSRI considering my main problem is OCD and GAD.  We talked a lot about it and she told me she would like to place me on Prozac.  She said for me, because my neural pathways have been the same for 20 plus years, that I would need a higher dosage of Prozac especially for anxiety and OCD.   I see on this forum, that so many people are on 20mg, or 40mg for anxiety disorders.   You should be on 60mg at least, do not be afraid to go higher.  People that say Prozac or an SSRI didn’t really do anything for their anxiety or ocd is because they are only taking a 20mg dose,  That is not an OCD dose.  40-80mg for anxiety and OCD.   Please up your dose.   Use the medication, REALLY USE IT.  Do not be afraid!My doctor started me on 40mg, eventually took me to 100mg, and then I went back to 80mg.  Yes the side effects are insane, I was nauseated, I couldn’t sleep, I was shaking, I had anxiety, but she prescribed me Ativan and said to use it until the Prozac kicked in.  That the Ativan would keep me comfortable until that happened.  Don’t try to be a hero, use your Ativan or your Xanax or whatever to stay as comfortable as possible.I could write so much more, but I’ll conclude with this.  4 months after being on 80mg of Prozac everyday, I woke up one day and I was cured.   Yes cured.  I had no OCD, I had no anxiety, I no longer had fears or phobias.   I was cured.   You have no idea how that day felt.  It was like the first day of my whole entire life.  I woke up being the real me, who is free spirited and isn’t afraid of anything!  I was finally free, I was no longer a prisoner.  I didn’t even have to go to therapy.  I just woke up one day a brand new person, from taking a high dose of Prozac every single day.DO NOT go off of the antidepressants.   Your ocd, your anxiety, depression etc will come back.  I WOULD never dream or even think to come off of my antidepressants,  I have an illness, that will return if I go off the medication, because I have a brain disorder.  OCD is a brain disorder.  Do not stop taking medication for your brain disorder, do not try to fix your brain disorder with just a 20mg or 40mg dose.  Own your medication, be on it for life.It’s been 5 years since I have been cured.  If it wasn’t for Prozac, I would be dead.1)You need a psychiatrist2)Do not be afraid to take more than 40mg of Prozac to treat panic attacks etc,  I am on 80mg a day and my life is a ball.  It is so wonderful and so carefree.3)Do not stop the meds.  Be on the meds for life.",priya3434

I am notoriously moody, possibly from BPD, and I do have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder where I have repetitive thoughts and the only way I can describe Prozac is that it feels like a vice grip on your brain that made you think about things over and over, releases completely.I feel so in control and wherever I put my focus, it stays without drifting back.I love this medication so much I will never leave it. The only complaint I have is that it does take forever to work. Forget about the 6 to 8 week rule, it will take a few months. And when it works, you will feel so amazing. For me, 60 mgs is ideal.",Southern Summer
85,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,,"June 14, 2014",144,I have Obessive compulsive disorder which causes a lot of anxiety and depression. Prozac has improved my quality of life I'm now a calm happy person with a great family of my own after being on Prozac a year. It really helps me focus on the real problems in my life and reaching a resolution instead of just feeling overwhelmed. It also greatly increases my energy and focus! It does not make me a zombie to emotion but it does prevent me from obsessing and lingering on how things make me feel. I still feel sad anger etc but in normal amounts like everyone else. Aside from very detailed dreams I've had no negative side effects. ,RayS45672
86,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 13, 2013",38,"I had my first major depressive episode in the late 80's when my first child was a toddler.  I was put on 20 mg of Prozac and felt like I got my life back.  However, it seemed to quit working and the next 20 years I went through almost every SSRI there is as well as a couple of common anti-anxiety drugs and none of them seemed to work very well.  About 4 years ago I went back on Prozac and this time I was taking 60 mg for ocd.  It has worked quite well but I think my body is getting used to it again.  My doctor wants me to consider changing to Lovox.  I had thought I had already tried that in the past but I have to do something because I feel like I am slipping into the abyss again.",DPenn

I was diagnosed with severe obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)when I was 14. Have lived with OCD and anxiety ever since. I'm now 32 and for the last two years since taking Prozac I feel normal again. I have experienced no side effects but did quickly realize that alcohol does not mix. But, I'd rather give up alcohol than go back to a mental institution.",fishcake dai
88,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 15, 2013",106,"In 1990 (age 45) I had a nervous breakdown. I did a lot of strange things and ended up in a mental ward. Because of medication I was taking I developed a problem with simple walking. While at the hospital, I decided to re-teach myself to walk normally. I practiced all the time. I got it right by the time I left but I found it was now impossible to stop walking back and forth, I was pacing all the time. This went on at least a year. Then my doctor thought that PROZAC would possibly help me. After starting Prozac, 2 weeks into it, I sat down and no longer needed to pace.....aaaahhhhh...Peace at last. I continue to take it for depression, no side effects noticed.",venus8i8

90,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 6, 2012",170,"Prozac has changed my life. I've suffered from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Anxiety, and Depression since I was in my pre-teens. I've tried Celexa and Paxil, but couldn't sleep at all while using them. I asked my physician to prescribe Prozac on the advice of a friend and I've had amazing results.  I started at 10 mg a day and increased to 20 mg a day after a month. I noticed that I was drowsy and unmotivated during the day when I took the medicine in the morning, so I switched to a bedtime dose and I haven't noticed any side effects since then. Prozac makes me calmer and much more in control of my fears. Others who didn't know I had gone on medication have noticed a positive change as well.  I've been on Prozac for 4 months.",Thank you Prozac
91,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 6, 2012",40,I love Prozac. It really helped with keeping me relaxed and in a decent mood and severely lessened my need to feed the OCD. For some reason my doctor recommended that I should try Zoloft instead. For the first two weeks on Zoloft I had diarrhea and now after six months on it I am starting to have moderate to severe pain in my legs. My leg muscles always feel as if they need a good stretch.,quetzacotl
92,Prozac,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8.0,,"March 9, 2012",82,"I took Prozac for 15 years and it worked great for obsessive compulsive disorder!  About 3 years ago I started noticing ""mania"" where I couldn't sleep or sit still to even eat.  After seeing several different doctors who treated it with medication for ADHD or Bi-polar it was determined that it was a side effect to Prozac so I stopped taking Prozac and all the mania stopped. Google shows two side effects to Prozac are 1) can't sit still and 2) can't sleep at night.  I wanted to share this unusual experience to help any others who may be experiencing mania and can't figure out why.  If you too are on Prozac then it may be a side effect but check with your doctor.

I feel like myself for the first time in forever.  I've tried other antidepressants and anti-anxiety medicines and nothing else has worked for me.  I'm already having less obsessive thoughts and compulsions, and the crippling sense of dread, anxiety and panic that accompanies my OCD is lifting. I just started it recently so I'm trying not to get my hopes up, but the preliminary results have been amazing.  I'm so grateful to feel like a human being again.",Anonymous

Currently, I've been on 40mg/day for about 5 weeks or so. It seems to be helping me with my OCD somewhat. I've noticed that I haven't been quite as bad as I used to be, but I'm also seeing a counselor, which is helping as well.
