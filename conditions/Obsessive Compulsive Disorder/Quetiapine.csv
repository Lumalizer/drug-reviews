0,Quetiapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,,"March 22, 2022",1,"I have been taking quetiapine for a year.  The psychiatrist gave me quetiapine to lower my anxiety and OCD.  I had horrible images in my head, I could not sleep.  Quetiapine helps me a lot to cope with anxiety and OCD, significantly improve my sleep, mood, everything.  I was bad,  I was devastated, then I asked for help and this has helped me, I am another person, I found myself!I never thought I would say this but quetiapine saved my life. Do not hesitate, ask for help, I believe in myself that you will succeed!  A 10 for quetiapine!",Alma
1,Quetiapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 6, 2021",3,"SSRI meds were not working for my depression/OCD/severe panic, after a horrendous breakdown earlier this year, ending in me moving back in with my parents for 6 months, I spoke to my GP about adding a different medication ""off-label"" to help ease my symptoms (at this point I'd been living in a constant state of panic for a number of months). I am pregnant so Quetiapine was recommended by my antenatal mental health team. There's no magic pill for anything, however this has been a game changer. I've gone from being a vegetable, who couldn't eat or leave the house, to feeling a bit more like myself again, I am back living in my own home with my husband and starting to socialise too. I still have OCD, and annoying intrusive thoughts, but the anxiety and panic is now way reduced, more like an irritating discomfort. This med has helped me get back on track with my recovery and I am starting to enjoy each day bit by bit (I'm also getting brilliant sleep and no daytime drowsiness!)",Amy
2,Quetiapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 5, 2021",4,I was diagnosed with OCD last January and then with an affective mood disorder in June. I tried 5 different drugs including lithium (which for me was the absolute worst) last year and this was last drug my psychiatrist prescribed and I have been on it since Sept 2020 it is by far the best. I am me again. I still have Pure O but the intrusive thoughts are so much easier to manage with Quetiapine.  It does make me a little drowsy at night but I appreciate the help it provides me in getting a decent nights sleep. Highly recommend.,Lulu
3,Quetiapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 20, 2021",16,"In 2015 I was on Lithium 900mg and Qutipin 600mg. I had these strange superstitions along with these vicious and intimidating thoughts. When I told my psychiatrist about this the first thing he did was to stop Qutipin. Then he introduced Olanzapine which I found very helpful in the beginning when it was on low dose. But when the dose increased Olanzapine could do very little to stop my OCD. I became dumb and dormant. I quit football. For the next 5 years I was on high dose of Olanzapine, sometimes more than 15mg. I could do nothing about my future. I had no goals. All I was doing was eat fast food. But in April 2021 I decided to quit Olanzapine and start Qutipin after consulting my doctor. I started decreasing Olanzapine by 2.5mg and increasing Qutipin by 50mg. On decreasing Olanzapine to 2.5mg and increasing Qutipin to 350mg I got great satisfaction. My will/drive was increased, OCD symptoms were completely gone, I also started playing tennis and my short term memory got improved.",Ramandeep S

I was suffering from OCD and depression, it was a terrifying combination as I couldn't stop thinking about how terribly depressed I was. I take 150mg at night and my symptoms are pretty well managed. I also take venlafaxine 300mg alongside.",Poppy
5,Quetiapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,,"April 20, 2021",8,"For 3 years I was suffering from severe anxiety and OCD.  Previously I'd had ""classic"" germ OCD, but this time it was primarily obsessive thoughts. It was the worst period of my life, leading to severe depression etc.Two SSRIs and SSRI+Risperidone+exercise+therapy did not work.Finally a doc added 100 mg Seroquel to SSRI instead of risperidone, and this changed everything. It empowered me to take control of my thoughts. Adding exercise, my life changed from extreme misery to a normal and happy life. Med. literature does not show Seroquel as a useful addition to SSRI for OCD and it does for risperidone. This may be true for germ OCD. For me, it was the complete opposite. The doc. who gave me Seroq. said that for me with elaborate, obsessive, in retrospect absurd, thoughts about how things go wrong in the future, risp. belongs to the trash bin, and Seroq. is likely helpful, which it was. If this is your case, talk to your doctor.",Anonymous
6,Quetiapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 3, 2021",14,This is the only thing that are able to keep my thoughts under control. I don’t believe that OCD will be under control with this medicine only because in many cases these condition are followed with depression and anxiety. I also take Fluoxetine and Pregabalin. I feel a huge relief that allows me to function and learn what my therapist says. True life saver combo.,vstud
7,Quetiapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 15, 2021",27,"This drug is the only drug I have ever taken that helps my massive anxiety and suicidal depression. I believe I am a high functioning borderline, and I was spinning out of control after a traumatic breakup with my partner. This drug saved my life! It worked immediately, the first night I took it. It took away all my suicidal thoughts that were completely overwhelming me — likely saving me from a stay at a psychiatric hospital. It has also helped eradicate obsessive thoughts about my ex partner and compulsion to contact my partner. I feel calm and relatively reasonable. I’m an attorney, and I can now focus on work so much better! Before, I was simply overwhelmed and could not focus enough to comprehend documents and client comments/emails. I don’t know how this drug works, but what a godsend! I’m on 50mg nightly. I am so grateful!",luzmagica

10,Quetiapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 14, 2020",55,"I suffered from severe OCD for 30 years. After trying everything my doctor put me on a combination of quetiapine 100mg a day and prozac 40mg a day. It has given me my life back. The OCD still lurks in the background but now I can make plans, I sleep well and I can have fun. My only regret is the waste of so many years of my life when there is a drug combo that works.

12,Quetiapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 11, 2019",83,"I started taking seroquel about a year ago to help with insomnia causes by OCD and anxiety. It helped me incredibly, I took either 25 mg-50 mg each night to help me sleep. It has helped so much with my OCD and taken the edge away from my anxiety. I use to get very fixated on intrusive thoughts to the point where I couldn't sleep, but with this medication I can actually slow my thinking down and rationalize and calm down. I just want to say, if you’re struggling with OCD and anxiety and cannot sleep, please reach out for help. Sleep deprivation can worsen your symptoms and thinking! Please reach out for help if you are struggling with any kind of mental health issue.",lorie

14,Quetiapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 31, 2019",21,"Struggle with a lot of insomnia due to OCD and anxiety, I often times have trouble falling asleep. But this medication lets me get 8 hours of sleep every night which allows me to cope with the anxiety and OCD. It really helps with unwanted OCD thoughts, lets thoughts come and go better. It doesn’t completely get rid of my very general daily anxiety but it helps me sleep which is very important to me!! Also I’ve experienced no weight gain, only side effect would be if I take it late 12 am -1 am and night and have to get up early the next day I do feel a little drowsy for a bit.",Idk

Completely removes rumination right up until a couple of hours before dose. I sleep really well but if I take it after 4pm I have trouble rising for work and I am in a fog most of the next day.

17,Quetiapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 20, 2019",73,"I started on Seroquel in January 2013 after a hospitalization. My treating psychiatrist prescribed it after I discuss my challenges with ruminating thoughts, going back to my early youth. What a godsend this medication has been for me. No more thinking about the same thing, over and over and over again. Even though Seroquel is used off brand for rumination, it really has improved the overall quality of my life. So for those that suffer with ruminating thoughts, please know there is hope !!!",ADee

It helped with my intrusive thoughts, I didn't have to do my mental compulsions as much and reduced my feelings of guilt. Does make me wake up later than usual and also shakiness after taking it at night. I didn't gain weight on the medication, however I do keep up with exercise as usual.",Accuracy
19,Quetiapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8.0,,"December 17, 2018",15,"I use quetiapine in conjunction with Luvox with adequate results. Thoughts are less overwhelming, but still present. I usually have a fairly high tolerance for medications, and experience few side-effects, however this drug was an exception. I started on 25mg (the lowest dose available) and they made me mentally and physically exhausted for almost 24 hours. I was unable to function normally for at least 12 hours after the initial dose. I went off them because of this, but started again at the suggestion of my psychiatrist. She suggested halving the tablets. I just went with the 25mg, but took them very early in the evening (no later than 5 pm). I found I could wake up okay in the morning, and was myself by about 11am. I've been on them for about 3 months now and have increased the dosage steadily. I have just moved up to 100mg and feel fine. No side-effects, except for memories in the couple of hours after taking the drug feeling vague and seeming somehow dreamlike.",npocko
20,Quetiapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,6.0,,"July 21, 2018",25,"I was surprised that other people say how this puts them to sleep as it did the exact opposite to me. When I first took it I started feeling very disorientated & anxious, and after barely falling asleep I soon woke up with a panic attack. I continued taking it cuz the doctors pressured me but the more I took it the harder it was for me to fall asleep & I started having very painful heart palpitations 1 hour after I took the quetiapine. I noticed that it has a mood-stabilizing effect and also suppresses OCD. After a few days all my obsessions and intrusive thoughts greatly decreased. After a few months of taking I even started taking some other pills for sleep cuz Quetiapine ruined my sleep but  it did make me more stable during the day. The side effects I had are: insomnia, feeling tired in morning, heart palpitations (which greatly decreased the longer I took it), and hunger for carbs. As a sleep-aid I give it a 1/10 - its awful and even ruins my sleep, as a mood-stabilizer 7/10, and as an anti-OCD 8/10.",PoundingHeart
21,Quetiapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 23, 2018",77,"I take Seroquel for Anxiety/OCD which is rather severe, and I never thought I could feel as good as I do now. I was always scared of seroquel because of the potential weight-gain, but I find my appetite is actually less now! My head is clear, my thoughts make sense, I literally cannot ruminate no matter how hard I try. It's very bizarre but it's incredible. I feel like I have a life now. The only reason I didn't rate it a 10 is because it gave me headaches/muscle tension in the beginning, but thats slowly fading which is great. Don't be scared of seroquel, it might save your life.",hburn

23,Quetiapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 1, 2018",37,"I have been quetiapine for just over a month.  It was prescribed for me by a psychiatrist as I have OCD.  The outcome has been amazing, I cannot believe that it seems to have taken 'the edge off' the severe anxiety I had as a result of my OCD.  I don't feel spaced out but there is a feeling of 'numbness' I guess is the only way that I could describe it in my head.  My psychiatrist has increased the dosage from 75mg to 100mg but I think I may just stay at 75mg as I don't want to feel 'out of it'.  I would recommend it to anyone who has severe OCD.  Prior to taking this medication I was at rock bottom unable to get dressed and had no appetite.  I feel as though I have got my life back.  I would prefer not to be on medication but it is the best option as the alternative is feeling so low and depressed as a result of the anxiety caused from my OCD .",Miss K63

Personally, 15 minutes after I take it though I absolutely will not give my OCD the time of day, not because it goes away but because if I do the medicine makes it harder to focus and deal with whatever is bothering me and it can go on and on worse than normal.
