0,Olanzapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 26, 2022",0,I've been on 5mg of olanzapine (planning to increase it to 10mg) for around four months and it has completely eliminated insomnia and greatly reduced the symptoms of OCD. I'm experiencing no side effects.,rloldl
1,Olanzapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,7,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 3, 2021",0,"I was originally prescribed 10mg olanzapine to treat extreme mania caused by complications with pregnancy, antidepressants and bipolar disorder. At first it completely knocked me out at night, I slept a lot during the day and I also gained 30 pounds in a short time. Since the extreme mania eventually passed, I stopped taking it without consulting my doctor. After that, foods and smells became unappealing and would make me gag. My long-term OCD came back full force. After consulting with my doctor I started taking 5mg instead. Now my OCD is almost completely gone, I’ve lost weight, I’m not depressed, I sleep well and I have a lot more energy than I did taking 10mg—would not recommend going that high unless you really need to be on an antipsychotic. I’ve noticed a drop in creativity, but that’s better than suffering in my opinion.",Gigi
2,Olanzapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 3, 2020",10,"I started olanzapine at 10mg for OCD, now I take 7.5mg because it is so sedating. I plan on going down to 5mg my next doctor visit. Positives about this drug is it calms you down, helps you sleep and completely heals your mind and body from stress/anxiety. Negatives about this drug is it will 100% make you gain weight when you first start it, BUT you can control it and lose it with low carb dieting and running. Also it has caused my hair to thin out, but I take hair biotin gummies now to help with that. Overall. Id say this is about a 8 out of 10 just due to it having some negative side effects. But it has very much helped me. I'm 25 and was 80 pounds when I started it, now I weight 107. So about 27ish pounds of weight I put on. Hoping when I go down to 5mg I will be about to lose some and my hair may fluff back up.",Cdwilson
3,Olanzapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 14, 2020",11,"At 10 mg olanzapine completely cured my panic attack, OCD and depression. I take it with 20 mg vilazodone. Godsend!",Anonymous
4,Olanzapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 9, 2019",33,"Coerced to take this; gave me permanent anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure). Avoid. I'd avoid this whole class of medications to be honest with you. If you're in the throes of a violent psychotic episode take one of the newer ones (Vraylar, Rexulti) that don't totally block dopamine. If you're not psychotic, acknowledge that taking these may sabotage your brain and ruin your life.",dordeduh
5,Olanzapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 6, 2018",15,Have ran the gamete of antidepressants for the last twenty eight years and thought that I was as un-depressed as I would ever be. I take Wellbutrin and Prozac. But after I went Rambo on neighbors down the road my physician added 7.5 mg of zyprexa at night. For the first time I actually felt happy for no reason. I still have bad days but they are fewer. Side effects are minimal. I sleep better. I wish that the neighbors down the road would take a happy pill too and just chill.,Bees
6,Olanzapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 20, 2017",46,"This medication saved my life, after years of closet OCD, and anxiety I was suicidal an couldn't take one more day.  They started me at 5 mg an it's never been upped, my OCD is non existent an I finally feel happy and comfortable in my own skin!!! I smile!!! No weight gain (but I am gluten free and an avid walker) I still have occasional panic attacks I take xanax for, but this med has made them minimal. It has helped my head to toe pain from depression as well. I get up at 6 am everyday and not sleeping all day like some have said, I work a full time job an take care of kids with no side effects at 5 mg.",Mom24/7
7,Olanzapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,5,,"February 22, 2017",11,"I was put on this drug for my OCD and to help me gain weight because I was very thin. It did work and helped those things, but it also caused extreme constipation. That's why I got off of it. Within a few days of being off the drug, I started to have no appetite and all food was disgusting to me. I never have had this problem in my life, I was always a big fan of food and would practically eat anything. Now it is hard for me to get enough calories in a day because I am disgusted by everything. I'll actually gag on foods now that I had no problem with prior to taking this medication. It has been many months since I got off of it, and no change. I would strongly recommend that you do not take this medication. It has been a nightmare. I am not writing this to be a jerk, I really want to warn people of what it can do so it doesn't happen to others. At the very least, consult with your doctor about this med. I have been on many different medications in my life, and this one by far the worst in terms of getting off of it.",Tmoneyz19
8,Olanzapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10,,"September 1, 2016",17,I'm 34 year old female that has obsessive thoughts about getting cancer. I have been battling ocd since 14 and this med has been a life changer. Although I still have thoughts I don't freak myself out half as bad. I sleep like a baby too! I have gained weight but loosing it now. 8 pounds total.,Sonja444

10,Olanzapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 1, 2015",19,"I was on Zyprexa for a good two years because of intrusive thoughts ranging from sexual violence all the way to OCD and I can say I mostly recovered thanks to these pills (which I took on the go in time of needs and before going to sleep at 10mg in the beginning) and a LOT of therapy. Downside is that I gained about 50 pounds (still trying to lose it after three months off medication) and I was just tired all the time, easily slept 14 hours uninterrupted. But it did help tremendously with the bad thoughts and the compulsions.",OsKarMike
11,Olanzapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 27, 2015",46,"Zyprexa (olanzapine):I was prescribed Zyprexa as a one pill cure for my OCD, Insomnia, Anxiety, And Manic Mood Disorder.  I am steadily increasing the Zyprexa dosage starting with 2.5mg.  At 5mg I can state that my OCD is practically gone.  I still have the desire to keep things orderly, but I am not getting frustrated or angry.  I can now leave things to do for another day without obsessing over and over in my mind.  No changes for the Insomnia or Anxiety at this dosage.  I will post as the dosage increases and the symptoms are relieved.  I have no negative effects to report at 5mg Zyprexa.",RowdyB88
12,Olanzapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,7,,"March 12, 2015",20,"Been on and off olanzapine for 15 years. Varying doses. As high as 15mg per day currently on 2.5mg per day. Dose wonders to reduce voices, anxiety, OCD thoughts, and i sleep like a log. On the down side I'm way less creative and energetic. I have put on huge amounts of weight in the past but when I came off the med the weight disappeared quickly. Now I can control weight gain by simply not eating processed foods and carbs. No carbs means no olanzapine food cravings. I'm still able to eat fruit sugars with no probs. I just eat lots of proteins  and vegetables. One major concern is my memory isn't as good, I used to be super sharp and I can't think as clearly nor process complicated concepts. Over all though it saved my life.",Anonymous
13,Olanzapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,4,,"December 23, 2011",26,"Zyprexa (olanzapine):Zyprexa helped with my obsessive compulsive disorder. It also relieved the depression greatly. Weight gain is a bad side effect from this medicine (taking 10mg daily). Gained 16 pounds in 2 months. The nights are better, just longer (around 11 hours every night).",Anonymous
14,Olanzapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,3,,"August 9, 2009",44,"Zyprexa (olanzapine):I was prescribed Zyprexa to treat my Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  I will say that my OCD behaviors were considerably helped, but the side effects were far too great for me.  Thankfully I'm a teacher and it was summer vacation because I couldn't wake up before 1pm (granted, I do tend to sleep late in the summer, but not that late), and when I could finally pull myself out of bed, all I would be able to do until around 7pm was lie on the couch with the posture of overcooked spaghetti, except when I was eating non-stop.  The cravings were insatiable.  I've always been very thin, but in that one summer I gained around 20 pounds.  I had to switch medicines.",Coriander
