I was driven by anxiety and compulsive thoughts. I had some compulsive rituals, but my obsessive thoughts controlled me completely and would send me into a downward spiral of anxiety and depression.

I was misdiagnosed with ADHD when I was actually extremely stressed from my unstable home life and I was given Vyvanse. The drug made my life a living nightmare and that’s when my OCD started. Since then I’ve been on and off with the disorder. I finally was prescribed Fluvoxamine and noticed multiple aspects of my life change. I no longer had migraines, my emotions felt more relaxed and slow, and my intrusive thoughts didn’t come with the same kick of anxiety that they normally had. I am on 100 mg right now but I plan to go up to 200. So far I would say this medicine is working great!",Pixie fan

My OCD was so bad it was interfering with every day. I have pure O OCD. Though I do think that some of it was me becoming better at managing it; the fluvoxamine made me fairly normal again. My OCD would still happen and my root causes didn’t go away, but it did make me better probably 50%. Only issue for me was when I tried to raise dose which was probably the reason I still had some OCD, my side effects were wayyyy too much. Give it a try though it’s definitely worth trying.

It only got better when I took Fluvoxamine. I don’t usually write reviews but this saved me after I got out of the the hospital. I could actually think through my thoughts and I felt it right away but it wasn’t officially at it best until it was totally in my system for a month or two, but just in a week I did feel like a whole new person was able to go a day with a severe panic attack for the first time in a while.

I ended up in professional school and was having a hard time remembering material. Also very depressed and anxious. My doctor switched me to Luvox when I was 24 years old ( between semesters). It was hard getting on to it, nausea and constipation. Plus, I couldn't sleep as well. Otherwise though, it made my depression almost disappear and I burned through my academic material so much faster and more efficient than on Anafranil. For me, a huge improvement over Anafranil. Much has happened since I started Luvox, such as a manic attack and diagnosis with BPD, divorce after 12 weeks  etc.. I will never have the normal life I would have if I had no mental illness.

Eventually, she prescribed fluvoxamine, so I stopped Anafranil and started it. The experience was AWFUL: immediately I started feeling kind of detached from everything, what it came out to be as a profound state of depression. The doctor increased the dose and things didn't change at all. After two and a half months taking fluvoxamine and feeling completely depressed, emotional detached from everything and with a permanent underlying ""dark""/strange feeling, I decided to stop it.

I feel happier and not panicky and worried almost all of the time.  It is sedating and I think I feel less motivated, though, but I am not sure if it because I am less high on nerves driving me on all the time and now depression is bringing me down or if it is the drug.",banana

I just moved up to 75mg and I think I want to go back down to 50mg because I am extremely tired and almost fell asleep at work even after seven hours of sleep.

I have added an anti-heartburn OTC medication to combat the heartburn.  I am going to give this a try and if I cannot tolerate the side effects within the next 3-6 months, I will try something else.  I also tried the extended release version at the same dosage.  This didn't help the OCD as well and I was left with some anxiety.  The heartburn was a bit better but nothing to celebrate about.

I never really noticed it until a year or so ago, but I strongly suspect it's the Luvox. All other blood work is normal (vitamin levels too). I know there have been a couple of articles on SSRI hair loss, esp. with Luvox, so I thought I'd put it out there. And there is slight drowsiness, which is totally fine for me because it chilled me out (I'm a high energy, anxious person), but if you struggle with depression this might be something to consider, as it is sedating.

I was crying all the time, very irritable, crazy mood swings, and my anxiety was worse and worse as I went up on my dosage. I stuck it out for a while because I know medications can make you worse before better but I was miserable. All of these symptoms got worse when I had to taper off 200mg to 50mg and then stop. I’ve been on 5 antidepressants and Luvox, was by far my worst experience. Truly made me worse.

This completely stopped all of her horrible intrusive thoughts however she was still dealing with other OCD traits for example not letting anyone touch or pat our dog for fear of germs, this would cause severe aggitation and anger disregulation so she started to take Abilify 5mg in the morning. This hit the spot perfectly and her OCD started to fade away and of course no aggitation or anger bursts. We have just started to reduce the Luvox to try and get down to 100mg and so far no problems but it is still early days.

I tried many different medications that led up to Lexapro with many that didn't work. I am glad that I gave Luvox a try! It was slow weaning down from 20mg of Lexapro while increasing up to 100mg Luvox. Now the obsessive and compulsive thoughts are more fleeting and less sticky, they do not bother me as much anymore.

Long story short, had a 75% decrease on my Y-BOCS score, meaning ""very much improved"" (I went from 31 points which means severe OCD to 8 points which means mild OCD). With bibliotherapy (aka reading plenty of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Metacognitive Therapy Books) I've achieved complete freedom from OCD, being clinically healthy. Only downside is that fluvoxamine gave me extreme drowsiness which I counter with 150mg/day of modafinil (that's why I gave 9/10).",BrenoBaptista

Anxiety in this area was significantly reduced with the help of exposure.However, I've also had many suicidal episodes and it felt like my mind was fogged over which made me feel very disconnected from my surroundings.
