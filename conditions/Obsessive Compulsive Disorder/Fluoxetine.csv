0,Fluoxetine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 15, 2022",3,"I have OCD, depression, anxiety and PTSD. I had tried Fluoxetine in my early twenties and it seemingly caused me suicidal thoughts so I had to stop taking it. Now I'm in my later twenties, me and my psychiatrist decided to try it again and I am so thankful. It is helping me so much with my mental health-especially my OCD. I'm on 60mg right now and starting tomorrow, increasing it to 80mg. I had tried about a dozen meds before this one and nothing was helping..I was exhausted and losing hope. Please don't lose hope. Even if Fluoxetine isn't the one for you, there will be one.",Hopeful Spazz
1,Fluoxetine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 9, 2022",10,"Prozac (fluoxetine):I was very nervous to try Prozac because of my horrible hypochondria and fear of trying new medicines. I was constantly struggling with OCD intrusive thoughts and compulsions, as well as TERRIBLE anxiety. I felt as though my OCD and being in a constant state of worry were taking over my life. I’m 29 years old, work full time & decided that this way no way to live. I caved and started 10mg daily. Week 1 I was exhausted and in a fog. Week 2 was brutal, I had peak anxiety and OCD. I almost felt manic. I had a panic attack, was nauseous, & couldn’t eat. Week 3 I started feeling better, I noticed my intrusive thoughts weren’t constantly haunting me. Week 4 I woke up one day and felt like a new person. I no longer have intrusive thoughts or OCD routines, irritability is nearly gone, and I’m not in a constant state of worry. I feel 100x better, Prozac has changed my life. I’m posting this for people who are nervous to try. Try fighting through the side effects, it’s SO worth it.",OCD and Anxiety

I tried trazodone at first for anxiety and insomnia, then added quetiapine when the trazodone didn’t work. Then I started using Imovane which made me feel awful. My psychiatrist started me on 20mg Prozac to improve anxious and obsessive thoughts and depression. It has significantly improved those and I no longer feel the physical effects of anxiety or depression. It has also significantly improved sleep as I do not stress about not being able to sleep. Finally, it did cause a few side effects like headache and nausea for the first few days but it is now gone.",searching
5,Fluoxetine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,7.0,,"January 22, 2022",1,Been on 20mg Prozac/fluoxetine for nearly 3 weeks now and I’m hoping it will help with my OCD thoughts. I have obsessive thoughts about my girlfriend all the time. Like a song on repeat. It messes with my anxiety and also my feeling towards her. I was on cymbalta for  6 months prior but that didn’t work. I’m hoping I feel the therapeutic effects in the next few weeks.

The generic equivalent of Prozac did absolutely nothing for me, either for my ocd or my depression. I needed the brand name for it to work.

Be aware of sexual side effects of this drug. Total inability to reach orgasm during sex. And no, it wasn’t caused by anything else. I was checked out. Sometimes the inability to climax persists even after you’ve off the drug. I’m not the only one to experience this; there’s plenty of information on post SSRI sexual dysfunction.

I started on 10mg, and at 7 days, I doubled to 20mg. Other than maybe feeling SLIGHTLY ""dazey"" the first few days, I have had no other side effects. It has changed my life in just 3 weeks. Things are more vivid. Life is lighter. It almost feels like I'm constantly microdosing on mushrooms (if you know what that feels like)It got rid of the constant angst, the obsessive thoughts, the severe PMS symptoms. My sex drive didn't go away, if anything, it's even better because I actually like my boyfriend now, instead of the PMDD telling me I need to get out. It's a game changer, and it started working day 3-4 for me, with VERY minimal bad side effects. So thankful.",Positive Review
12,Fluoxetine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2021",1,"Prozac (fluoxetine):It was ok, but I didn't really like the feeling. I took 20mg for a week and then I quit. I felt like I couldn't think as deep, which I guess could be good for those with OCD, but I just felt off and would rather feel normal instead of on a medication. It felt like someone filled my head with oatmeal and I had to think around the oatmeal. I slept less and the sleep itself felt artificial. I did have a few interesting moments on it, but overall I wouldn't recommend it and I don't see how people can take this drug for long periods of time. My face even looked different. It was just a strange experience overall. I'm glad to be off it.",jessie

I have depression, anxiety, PTSD and severe OCD with the intrusive thoughts.  Before Prozac I have battled with depression and anxiety for years but the OCD has just hit hard within the past year and a half. To the point of loosing my family and friends over it because I was constantly questioning and accusing and it was just awful. My family doctor wasn't giving me the correct medicine. I have tried wellbutrin, lexapro, effexor etc. and none of them were helping me, I just felt like I was getting worse. I started seeing a Psychiatrist and she diagnosed me with severe OCD and put me on Prozac. The first week I couldn't really tell anything, the second week I felt alive again, like a weight had been lifted off of me, thoughts were still there but I was able to dismiss them a lot easier. Week three I am feeling a little down and depressed this week but I am not giving up. The way I felt with week 2 I hope to start feeling more often and even better.",Girlygirl

I had been getting treated for GAD which it wasn't hence why I didn't fully believe CBT worked for me. I can now relate to suffering from Anxiety and intrusive thoughts from an early age. The main point being when I started to have girlfriends and my OCD latched onto their previous relationships - everything from just going out to the usual things that happen. The doubt and anxiety just kept fuelling my thinking which I couldn't control. I was 1st put 20mg dose of fluoxetine which to be fair looking back did nothing, after around 15 years I upped my dose to 40mg which I believe did knock the edge off the anxiety and intrusive thoughts, eventually it just seemed to disappear when my son was born. I had a couple of great years finally being what I'd always dreamed of. i stupidly stopped taking the medication. 5 months later its back. Its been 6 week I'm now on 60mg and it seems to be working.",Stu1983

I had been suffering for weeks with debilitating OCD/anxiety and depression, Having been SSRI free for over 4 months but it came back with vengaence. In essence, fluoxetine works! For those nervous about the side affects - the first time I took it the anxiety/OCD was seriously INTENSE and took 8 days to work. At points it felt like I was losing the plot. If it got that bad again this time I was planning on taking Xanax while it kicks in. However, I’m 4 days in now and the anxiety/OCD has been pretty bad but I was able to ride it out. It’s now Day 5 evening and I can feel it is starting to work again. Depression has gone, head feels clearer with no more anxiety alongside the intrusive thoughts.

He recently found a psychiatrist who put him on Prozac. He is at the 8 week mark and has yet to see any benefit and in fact seems to have gotten worse.

I noticed quite the change with that increase after a month or so, and was finding myself less anxious throughout the day and feeling a little less guilty all the time. Just increased to 60mg a couple days ago and am feeling quite optimistic. While I still have my bad days, I really think this has saved me and I am so glad I gave it a try. I was apprehensive at first because of all the horror stories I've heard, and being anxious about trying a more intense medication but I am so so happy to have begun this journey and finding that there is hope.

I had Pure O Ocd from past 9 years for which I tried to manage without any medications and it was going good. But since last year it was so bad that I wasn’t the old me and was really depressed. It was terrible for me. Then I decided to take a psychiatrist opinion to start Fluoxetine. My psychiatrist advised me to start from 20mg daily and starting 2-3 days I actually felt better - may have been the placebo effect. Then after, the intrusive thoughts and my anxiety reached to another level. I had an appointment with my psychiatrist and I was told to increase the dose to 40mg. I am on week 5 and believe me this gave my life back. I feel more fresh/energetic and now able to concentrate more. Most people stop using it in 2-3 weeks but I would suggest you not to loose hope and trust fluoxetine. I know SSRI’s work differently in different people but you should wait at-least 5 weeks to see to start noticing it’s effect.Just relax and trust fluoxetine.",Ocdguy1

I had difficulty sleeping, dry mouth, forgetfulness, and extreme exhaustion. Now at week five my intrusive thoughts have decreased. When I do have them, I can let them go. I don’t ruminate like I was doing prior. I’m also not having panic attacks when trying to do every day tasks like going to the store or driving. This medication is slow working, so it takes time to feel improvement. A lot of information says 4-6 weeks but many people in support groups that I’m in say it took closer to 12 weeks to feel full benefit and if this is the case, I’m excited to see how I’ll feel in a few more weeks because I’m already feeling so much better!

I suffer from harm OCD or intrusive thoughts, not the more widely known OCD where you perform various rituals like Jack Nicholson's character. I never understood what these intrusive thoughts were and how much they affected me, I didn't even know if would have a diagnosis of some sort to finally identify what I have been going through for the past 13 years of my life. I started taking fluoxetine 5 weeks ago but it takes much longer to feel the therapeutic effect, I'm guessing at least 7-8 weeks. I'm on 40 mg and have noticed and a very positive change but still have some of those intrusive thoughts lingering.

My issue is, when we have periods and his OCD is ramping up, we have to increase and it seems like we have a honeymoon period and need to increase again.

99,Fluoxetine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 26, 2017",950,"Prozac (fluoxetine):I don’t find a lot of positive stories about antidepressants, or I find stories where people are taking the antidepressant the wrong way.I wanted to share my experience.  A positive one.I’ve had generalized anxiety disorder, SEVERE OCD, and panic disorder for as long as I can remember.  My first memory of having an episode was when I was 4 years old at my kindergarten interview.  I feel as though I was born with the illnesses mentioned above, right from the womb.  When I was a child I was extremely anxious, had bad separation anxiety from my parents and had extreme OCD, I was just a kid and thought that the way I was feeling is how all kids felt, I didn’t realize that I was different.  This went on, and got even worse in middle school.  I began developing trichtilomania in middle school.  In high school I went from being a 90% above student, to failing every class within a couple of years.  I couldn’t leave the house.  My panic disorder and gad caused debilitating physical symptoms.  I would be shaking when I had to leave the house, I wouldn’t drink alcohol because I was afraid of vomiting, I was suffering so much, for my whole entire life with severe phobias, fears, and anxiety.  I prayed and prayed and prayed to God every night for it to go away.  I was a 16 year old living in a prison of her own mind.  It never went away.  Every single day was the worst day of my life, I would wake up and the thoughts just started,  I never had a break.  My life was exhausting.I am of east indian background and my parents didn’t understand mental illness well.  It is very taboo in my culture.  I went to tons of doctors and they told me it was just growing pains,  no doctor ever told me that maybe I should see a therapist.  I didn’t have any support.  When I was 22 I attempted suicide.  Luckily the attempt didn’t work and I was forced to go on medication.  I was livid, I was so against antidepressants, I was so so so scared, it felt unnatural. My general practitioner put me on Effexor, I took it for almost 8 weeks, it helped me to not want to kill myself, but It also made me gain tons of weight which made me depressed, and it make me hear voices.  One evening a voice told me to choke my mom, and I started freaking out and my parents drove me immediately to the hospital.  At the hospital I talked to a psych nurse who calmed me down, and got me an appointment with a psychiatrist the next day.  This appointment and this psychiatrist saved my life, and changed my entire life.I want to really mention that you should not be going to a General Practitioner for mental illness medication, you should ALWAYS…ALWAYS go to a psychiatrist no matter what.  If your GP is the only person you are seeing to help you manage your meds for ocd, anxiety, etc, that is the WRONG MOVE.  That is such a common mistake people are making, you NEED a psychiatrist in order to get the meds right, please do not just go to your regular doctor, you’ll be cheating yourself.I went to the psychiatrist appointment the next day.  It was the first time I had ever seen a psychiatrist.   I got into her room and we talked about everything, my childhood, my phobias, my ocd.  She then brought my parents into the room to explain the whole situation to them and the fact that I have a chemical imbalance in my brain and that I have been suffering for way too long.  My parents were so supportive.  The doctor told me I was on the wrong medication, that I never should have been placed on Effexor which is an SNRI, and that I should be on an SSRI considering my main problem is OCD and GAD.  We talked a lot about it and she told me she would like to place me on Prozac.  She said for me, because my neural pathways have been the same for 20 plus years, that I would need a higher dosage of Prozac especially for anxiety and OCD.   I see on this forum, that so many people are on 20mg, or 40mg for anxiety disorders.   You should be on 60mg at least, do not be afraid to go higher.  People that say Prozac or an SSRI didn’t really do anything for their anxiety or ocd is because they are only taking a 20mg dose,  That is not an OCD dose.  40-80mg for anxiety and OCD.   Please up your dose.   Use the medication, REALLY USE IT.  Do not be afraid!My doctor started me on 40mg, eventually took me to 100mg, and then I went back to 80mg.  Yes the side effects are insane, I was nauseated, I couldn’t sleep, I was shaking, I had anxiety, but she prescribed me Ativan and said to use it until the Prozac kicked in.  That the Ativan would keep me comfortable until that happened.  Don’t try to be a hero, use your Ativan or your Xanax or whatever to stay as comfortable as possible.I could write so much more, but I’ll conclude with this.  4 months after being on 80mg of Prozac everyday, I woke up one day and I was cured.   Yes cured.  I had no OCD, I had no anxiety, I no longer had fears or phobias.   I was cured.   You have no idea how that day felt.  It was like the first day of my whole entire life.  I woke up being the real me, who is free spirited and isn’t afraid of anything!  I was finally free, I was no longer a prisoner.  I didn’t even have to go to therapy.  I just woke up one day a brand new person, from taking a high dose of Prozac every single day.DO NOT go off of the antidepressants.   Your ocd, your anxiety, depression etc will come back.  I WOULD never dream or even think to come off of my antidepressants,  I have an illness, that will return if I go off the medication, because I have a brain disorder.  OCD is a brain disorder.  Do not stop taking medication for your brain disorder, do not try to fix your brain disorder with just a 20mg or 40mg dose.  Own your medication, be on it for life.It’s been 5 years since I have been cured.  If it wasn’t for Prozac, I would be dead.1)You need a psychiatrist2)Do not be afraid to take more than 40mg of Prozac to treat panic attacks etc,  I am on 80mg a day and my life is a ball.  It is so wonderful and so carefree.3)Do not stop the meds.  Be on the meds for life.",priya3434

129,Fluoxetine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,7.0,,"April 25, 2015",28,Prozac (fluoxetine): Recommend using Lovan 20mg the generic brand of Prozac. Break in half to start at 10mg a day. Your looking for small signs of success. Keep a daily journal of your time taking it so you can look back TRUST ME this helps when spotting reaction patterns and finding right exact dosage amount. For some LESS Prozac is more benefit. Mania / sweating / twitching muscles was part of my first 2 months but settled down. Alcohol leaves toxins in your blood for 2 days that stop the medication working fully. Sex drive gone by 80%.** I have still had to apply daily mental awareness techniques and being aware of my thoughts to get great results. Not been a cure all but is brilliant,Hugo.

Ever since I was about 19 years old (29 now) I have dealt with depression that came in waves. My anxiety and obsessive tendencies didn't begin until I was 22 and had the military.

I finally decided to seek help and I was shocked to find out that I suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder which causes depression and anxiety. I started on Prozac and within the first 6 weeks I felt a rush of relief. I no longer obsessed over the smallest things.
