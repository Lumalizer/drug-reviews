1,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 13, 2022",2,"On it for two months. My first treatment after years-long invasive disturbing thoughts (sudden strong apprehensions about committing immoral/dangerous acts, tormenting, never-ending feelings of guilt, endless questioning/checking about doing things right) that had evolved to a general state of lethargia and distress by late November. I get slow release Venlafaxine (37,5mg for the first 7 days, 75mg ever since).A week into the treatment, I experienced a few extremely vivid/disturbing nightmares where I struggled to distinguish dream/awakeness and two suspected sleep paralyses. Ever since, no significant side effects, except initially stomach burns (eliminated via Omeprazole).Positive effect kicked in after 3 weeks: instead of being near-constant before, severe invasive thoughts are now episodical and better manageable. Episodical attacks are being treated with Prazepam (not a lasting solution though...) Constant anxiety state is gone.",Corvus
2,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 12, 2022",5,"This medication has changed my life, genuinely, at 44 years old, for the first time since I was a child I no longer have a constant cruel inner monologue, that has crippled me since I was a young child, which lead to the most terrible panic attacks. For the last 20 years, I've begged for help off medical professionals and by chance after a terrible few months I went to my doctor 3 mths ago and there was a new doctor there who prescribed me these and they have saved and changed my life, I find myself wondering why no one thought to give me these or similar. I thank that doctor and the people who have dedicated their life's to studying mental health and made these, thank u, thank u, thank u. They may have the same effect for everyone I understand, but they have changed my life for the better.",Kasp
3,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 5, 2021",4,"I’ve been on venlafaxine for 3 years. It made my OCD more manageable, and my social anxiety lessen significantly. The only side effect it has caused me has been difficulty eating, or anorexia (NOT anorexia nervosa). Other than that, it’s truly been a miracle drug for me. I increased my dosage once. I may increase once more.",bia
4,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,,"July 15, 2021",11,"This medication is a godsend. I have had panic disorder and intense anxiety all my life, and went on and off various medications. In the past year I have been diagnosed with pure OCD and my days were filled with constant intrusive thoughts and mental rituals. Within a week this medication completely wiped out my obsessions. My mom and grandma are also on this medication and have no issues. Some people have bad side effects, but I promise you this one is worth a go. It gave me my life back.",Kristie
5,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 13, 2021",7,"Works well for me (I have Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder) It is like when I am on Prozac, I lose appetite, consequent loss of weight, my mind feels different because it is not racing. This gives me some concentration issues I have yet not had the time to address but hope to overcome. My mood is stabilised and I feel otherwise at peace and happy.",Maria

8,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 27, 2020",2,"A complete miss for treating OCD. Effexor helped my mood, did not help my OCD, and made me feel awful physically. More days than not, Effexor made me suffer a terrible nausea, even throwing up on my way to work on multiple occasions. Eating two eggs with my meds helped the nausea some days, did not help other days. I'm now weaning off Effexor and I already feel even worse physically - my doctor had warned me that Effexor was notorious for being difficult to come off. After so many awful experiences with meds, Effexor felt like a waste of my life. I'm not looking forward to the next couple of months.",daiblue
9,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 23, 2020",15,"I was prescribed 75mg by my PCP after she diagnosed me with general anxiety disorder. I had suffered from anxiety since I was a child but never recognized it and never discussed it with a physician. When I described my experience and she diagnosed me, it was like a light bulb went off and my whole life suddenly made sense. Social anxiety, obsessive thoughts, general anxiety, and neuroticism had ruled my life for 40 years and I had never even recognized it. I'm extremely anti-medication, but Venlafaxine has improved my life and helped save my marriage. I had never realized my family had been held captive by my anxiety. I still take 75mg (a lower dosage) three years later, but when I've tried to lower my dosage or taper off completely, I've had huge spikes in negative obsessive thoughts. I'm pretty happy at the 75mg level.",GAR
10,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 2, 2020",25,"I’ve struggled with generalized anxiety, depression, panic disorder, OCD, among other things my entire life. With the pandemic my anxiety and graphic OCD intrusive thoughts got to the point where I could not function and do my day to day activities. It got to the point where I was suicidal and could not leave my bed. I was prescribed venlafaxine and lamictal and have noticed an immense improvement! I’ve been on it for a month now and no longer have panic attacks and while I still have intrusive thoughts, they do not affect me in the way it used to. I am extremely thankful for this medication as well as therapy. The negative side effects are sweats, excessive scalp picking (I’ve always done this but it’s become much worse) & disruptive sleep. I do wish I could get a full night’s rest, but I don’t dare stop taking this because it really has helped me in more ways than one!",Tots
11,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 30, 2020",9,"I was put on this for Obsessive disorder. I became apathetic personality, lost interest in others concerns, tired, loss of sleep, inability to release tensions, and lack of tact with others. I was in 37.5 extended release Effexor for 5 years and slowly decreased my dose myself. Side effects were minimal due to a gradual reduction over months of time. I Do NOT recommend taking this medication at all! Period. No exceptions.",Elaine

13,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 4, 2020",13,"The most awful drug I have ever been on, currently weaning myself off slowly as the withdrawals are the worst!

Stay away!!",Queen Z
14,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 26, 2020",68,My OCD intrusive thoughts were destroying me. I felt the only way out was suicide.  My dr didn’t seem to care. She is too involved in impressing her collegues with her talks and presentations .  Her psychiatric patients pay the bills .  so I went to a walk in clinic and discussed my OCD and situation with this new dr. He prescribed me 37.5 mg Effexor for a couple weeks and  then he suggested I increase it up to 75 mg. My mind slowed down from repetitive negative intrusive thoughts pretty much in the first week My life will never be perfect but I feel so much better and I’m no longer tormented by intrusive thoughts.  I no longer see that psychiatrist anymore   My new dr is thorough and I appreciate him.  Please be careful in choosing the right mental health care professional and all the best to those of you still suffering,Shareen
15,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,,"December 17, 2019",27,"For me venlafaxine has honestly been a God send. I was on it for a few years and ended up going to high of a dose, so I tapered off and tried another med. But it didn't work at all so I started low again on effexor and it has completely changed my life. I've been doing great! I'm on 75mg now. Only medicine that has helped my OCD.",Anonymous

17,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,1.0,,"June 13, 2019",5,"Unable to select multiple conditions but I'm on this for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), chronic pain, PTSD and  shortly after starting Effexor had an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis.  Prior to effexor, zoloft for 9 , had a ""2"" recent unintentional drug overdoses, one was while in the care of an inpatient hospital stay and a loved one committed suicide It was a GOD send for the first 2 months, it put me out on my couch and I stopped caring about all my pain.  I stopped caring about cleaning and order. ""The feeling of sitting on the edge of my seat anxious with every muscle tightened in my body went away, for THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE."" .   At 6 months developed photophobia, diarrhea, appetite loss, mood swings with rage, then these lead into loss of taste, weight, fatigue, nephropathy, tremors, jerking, dystonia. It was the dystonia diagnosis that got her attention this was the sign the drug needed to be stopped.",CNSmess

Never had ritualistic OCD, but as far as intrusive and obsessive thoughts go, I was in a bad spot before I was prescribed. I take 187.5mg daily, and will forever. It takes about 10-12 weeks to get it completely into  your system. But worth it. Side effects for me include an occasional headache, cured with ibuprofen.Effexor is a game changer.",BT

This has done NOTHING for my OCD, but all SSRIs have given me horrible side effects, so this is the better of evils and I’m thankful for it.

20,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 8, 2018",45,"I've been on Venlafaxine for two months now, and it has drastically improved my obsessive and intrusive thoughts, anxiety, and depression. I have been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder as well, and it has eased my anxiety and I feel like I can live a happy life! I am currently on 150mg per day. Starting the medication was rough, but if you get through the first couple of weeks, it gets so much better! I still have occasional anxiety, which I think is more situational than anything. If I allow my mind to wander too much, some intrusive thinking might invade my mind, but it's not anything like it was before. I was honestly very scared to start taking this medication after reading some reviews, but I'm glad I stuck to it!",AnxiousMama

22,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 10, 2017",5,"Disclaimer: This is only general information. Consult a doctor before making any changes to your medications.If you're trying to get off antidepressants, it may be easier to FIRST switch to an antidepressant other than venlafaxine. A different antidepressant may be easier to withdraw from. Some doctors will allow you to switch antidepressants in a process that does not require a full withdrawal from the first drug, before starting the next one . My doctor allowed this and it was relatively easy, but it can be dangerous if not done properly.I'm currently giving venlafaxine a second try. It worked well but i switched drugs because of side effects.",Troopster
23,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 2, 2016",18,"I have been at 75 mg for 6-7 years now. Originally to treat depression but I was later diagnosed with OCD and now realize that the symptoms were the cause of the depression. This understanding helps as my coping mechanism. I have tried coming off Venlafaxine but had no success and eventually went back. The drug does help with the insane thoughts and images in my head but they are still present, just not as intense (unless I miss a dose). I will be attempting quitting again when I have time to commit to it. The last time I tried it ended with me rear ending another vehicle. Minor but unfortunate. I'm hoping for something more holistic and will consult my Dr. before my next try.",Venlafaxine Addict

At last I am no longer wrapped up in my own thoughts, going over the same thing again and again. I have obsessive thoughts due to a bad relationship with a relative. I am enmeshed in the relationship and have tried talking therapies and Prozac.Nothing has given me relief like this medication. I have had only mild side effects, dry mouth, some loss of appetite.",Londoner
26,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 9, 2015",13,Coming off of it is one of the worst things I've gone through. I wish I could go back in time and never start using it. I've recently decided medication isn't the right path for me. I was on Celexa before this. When I missed a day on Celexa I could deal with the pain but when I miss a dose of Effexor I feel awful for at least the next two days. This led me to the decision to come off of it and I'm almost ready to go back on just to make the withdrawals stop. My doctor always tried to encourage me to go up to the 100s as well and I was headstrong about staying on the 75mg. I'm glad I chose to stay that low as I can't imagine trying to come off anything higher. I would not recommend taking this medication.,Ash3
27,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,,"September 11, 2015",34,"I've been on Effexor for about 3 years now. I started at 75mg/day and am now at 37.5mg/day. Even at this dose, for me, it has drastically reduced the obsessive tendencies I had before. I very rarely have spiralling down obsessive periods now. I really dislike being on meds, but have resigned myself to being on Effexor the rest of my life. It has improved the overall quality of my life quite a bit. The only side effect I've noticed is if I miss taking the dosage at the same time every single day. If I'm off even by a few hours, I start to get the previously mentioned ""brain zaps"" which feel very odd. It feels like my brain goes through a warp of some type for a moment or two here and there. Once I have one, I realize I haven't taken my dose.",LuckyNumber13
28,Venlafaxine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 27, 2015",31,"I havent had a single panic attack since starting this drug which has been a MIRACLE. It was rough to get on it, like having the flu, but so worth it. I had GI side effects for about another two weeks but then those disappeared too. I have no bad side effects now. My default mood has returned to pretty-happy and things I couldn't do because of OCD, I can do now. I think this might be the one! I only gave it a 9 because I've been picking my scalp nonstop since about a month on it, but not sure if its because of effexor or not.",Eru

I'm currently in the stages of slowly tapering off of it, with instruction from my doctor. I went from 75mg to 150mg. Now, I am taking a 75 37.5 for a week, tapering it off every week from there. You need to be extremely disciplined about taking this medicine every day, and at the same time every day. With my schedule, I was never able to take it at the same time every day. I would get what are called ""brain zaps,"" which is the feeling like everything rushed to your head for a split second. I also had sexual side effects on Effexor, though it was more noticeable on lower doses. I've been on Zoloft, Luvox, Prozac and Effexor. On to Cymbalta now.",JC33

It is the only one that has had very few side effects as long as you take it regularly. It has greatly helped me deal with my OCD and has greatly improved my overall mood and outlook on life. I take it in conjunction with Pimozide which has eliminated the intrusive unwanted thoughts and also Dextrostat which helped eliminate the tiredness associated with with taking the previous medications.  These 3 medications have given me a new lease on life.  Prior to this mix of medicines I must have tried a couple dozen that either didn't work for me or had too many side effects.",OCD Guy
