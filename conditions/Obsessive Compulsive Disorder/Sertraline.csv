0,Sertraline,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 12, 2022",1,"Zoloft (sertraline):I had a mental breakdown, which I attribute either to late onset OCD or my OCD rearing its head. I couldn’t stop thinking and believing I had cheated on a homework in university 5 years ago, and wanted to get myself expelled from university. I had multiple people including a professor and academic advisor tell me it wasn’t cheating but I couldn’t stop thinking this. I had panic attacks daily until I went on Zoloft. I started on 25 mg of Zoloft and then went to 50 mg. Now if those obsessive thoughts start crawling into my mind, I can just brush them away. This medication probably saved my life, because I was getting to the point of considering suicide. I had zero side effects with this drug.",Mary
1,Sertraline,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 8, 2022",1,"I have pure ocd and Agoraphobia. I was actually prescribed sertraline just for my panic disorder because my doctor doesn’t know about my OCD. I was prescribed 50mg for 4 weeks and I've been on 100mg for 2 weeks. The first night was awful, my anxiety went through the roof and I was convinced that I was never going to recover. I woke up the next day certain that I was gonna stop taking sertraline but I decided to keep going. After about 2 weeks i noticed a slight improvement and I noticed my thoughts weren’t causing as much anxiety and I could kind of just brush them off. After 6 weeks my OCD is so much better, if I have a distressing thought I usually just forget about it and move on. As for my Agoraphobia, I have hardly been out to know if it works for that but I’m sure if I start going out more it will be easier. I’m still waiting for the full effects of sertraline to kick in but I've heard it it can take 2-3 months.",adam123451
2,Sertraline,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2022",0,"I took sertraline for many symptoms. However, one reason I wanted to take it was my OCD of constantly checking things, especially in the evening. Unfortunately, I have to say that sertraline did not improve the conditions. I do want to mention that I noticed a decrease in panic attacks, though!I simply share this in case someone I wondering why sertraline does not seem to have the desired effect. I similarly upped the dosage, without success. (Weirdly enough, after discontinued medication, my OCD even got a slight bit better. I have no idea why. I hope this helps someone out there.)",Jesper Jansen

Had a horrible Postpartum experience and started experiencing OCD thoughts/depression/anxiety. The whole postpartum depression experience. It’s the worst I have ever mentally felt in my life. I just didn’t feel like myself. I started Zoloft on 25mg and it helped but it was still there. I started on 50mg. It took about 8 weeks but I’m almost completely better. I never review stuff but this really helped me. I feel like myself again. Please try it and give it time. It saved my life,Anonymous
5,Sertraline,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 13, 2022",2,I’ve been on sertraline now for 4 weeks.  It has just started to work .  My OCD intrusive thoughts are less severe.  I don’t feel so irritable and hypersensitive.  I’m still going to give it a full 8 weeks as people say it takes quite a while to really work.  I’m hopeful that in that time I will feel even better.  I’ll report back in another month.,Stacy
6,Sertraline,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 9, 2022",1,"Used for Pure OCD/intrusive thoughts. Doctor suggested going up to the max of 200mg. Personally didn't experience any side effects as slowly went up from 50mg for 2 weeks, 100mg for 2 weeks, 150mg for 2 weeks and then finally the 200mg. When used alongside daily exercise and therapeutic techniques; (don’t judge thoughts no matter what they are,  if you want to think about them less actually think about them more). my condition greatly improved over the course of a year after being in a really dark place. Not a miracle cure alone but for me it greatly helped combined with other life improvements to return to a sense of normality. Didn't get rid of the thoughts, it just made me not care as much about them when I had them; breaking the anxiety loop. Ask doctor to give this medication a try. You can get your life back on track",Andrew

8,Sertraline,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 29, 2022",1,"Zoloft (sertraline):Pure O, absolutely unstoppable tides of intrusive thoughts and ideas that would cause me to obsess over my health, checking constantly to make sure I wasn't developing or coming down with XYZ disease, mental or physical, you name it. The anxiety it would induce was so bad my psychiatrist first prescribed me xanax up to 3 times a day along with 50mg sertraline. I would say it took me a full month to feel better with it, which sucks because it meant dealing with the obsessions a full month, but once they kicked in: wow. I didn't even notice 3 months had passed without another anxious break or pure O flareup. Obviously ERP was also a huge help but I don't think I would've been able to beat OCD without it. So yeah, the only con I'd say is the time it takes for it to really kick in, a quick search shows the median being around 2-3 weeks for most people. I think my pure O being related to health caused me to worry constantly and check for side effects which might have delayed it a bit.",EmilioT
9,Sertraline,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 6, 2022",1,"I've been on 50mg of sertraline for around 2 months. For the first few weeks of sertraline I felt a little dizzy and my anxiety definitely felt worse for a week or two. By around the 4th week I had kind of given up. Despite not really having any side effects, I still had all my OCD symptoms. Week 4 was especially bad, I had panic attacks every day and felt completely hopeless. But by week 5, I felt like a new person. My intrusive thoughts used to be constant and so distressing. But now I have the thoughts maybe three times a day, and I am able to dismiss them completely. Next time I see my doctor I might ask for a dosage increase as I think that I could benefit from a little more sertraline. Overall, sertraline has changed my life. It has taken me from panic attacks daily, to not being able to remember the last time I had one. Of course this is just my experience but if anybody is reading this and considering taking sertraline- I highly highly recommend that you take it. You've got this!",sandalwood

I had been having intrusive thoughts for years & I didn’t know what they were, I just thought something was wrong with me. I struggled with (Homosexual OCD) the most. My brain convinced me that I was transgender & in denial. I felt so much shame & I wish I had gotten help sooner because it would have saved me a year of my life. I have been taking  Zoloft for almost a year now. I was very hesitant about starting antidepressants because I was scared they would make me suicidal. I tried multiple different meds ‘til I fell upon Zoloft. My initial dose was 50mg & I slowly increased to 150mg. I mean it when I say I could not live w/o this medication. I could cry about how much Zoloft has saved me, I finally feel like myself & I didn’t think that would happen again.",Caroline

13,Sertraline,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 1, 2021",1,"39F I suffer from mild depression. My two BIG troubles are PTSD and OCD.  I have been on Sertraline for almost three years. Started at 50mg and currently take 200mg with buspirone 2x daily. I had debilitating side effects for a full three months! The only reason I continued with the meds was because my boyfriend begged me to not stop. My quality of life was poor.  If you live or have lived with a person who is afflicted with OCD you too have a poor quality of life. After the side effects subsided I felt a feeling I had not felt in almost 15 years, quietness. Also my PTSD was not as severe but persistent. Each time my dose increased was because I could feel my inner demons peeking out from behind the curtain for longer periods of time each time they showed themselves. Each dose increase put those demons back in hiding.  I noticed that at 100mg my PTSD started to improve drastically! My PTSD made day to day life almost as difficult as my OCD.

It took me a good 5/6 weeks to start feeling the benefits, but I feel I am gradually improving week by week now. The first month or so of side effects weren’t the best, but this won’t be the case for everyone, and I did survive. So make sure you persevere because it is worth it! I still feel I could be better, so may up my dosage now I’ve levelled out, but I am still a far cry from the hole I was in prior to taking it. So give it a try and be kind to yourself.

15,Sertraline,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 23, 2021",6,I suffered from Anxiety/Panic Attacks and OCD for 2 years before I decided to try medication. I tried therapy and self-help methods first. These helped but I found that I started spiralling every 3 months or so.I started sertraline. It took me a couple of months to feel like I was on the right path. Add an extra month on top of that until I found the right dosage for me. It is a long journey but wow... I could live again. I stopped waking up in the morning filled with dread. I stopped getting lost in thought. The worried voice in my head got quieter and quieter with every dosage increase I did.I was terrified to start taking sertraline. I avoided it as long as possible because I thought that if I didn't need it then I was still winning. Nothing good comes from suffering. If you were like me you would have read these reviews 10 times over while hesitating to start. Just take the pill.,england93

Intrusive thoughts and obsessive behaviors have just been something I've grown to accept without knowing it. Prozac made me way too anxious and I gave up and thought I just wasn't meant for SSRIs. I was prescribed Zoloft a few months ago and it was the perfect fit. It took a while for me to find my perfect dose (150mg), but now I am a completely different person. Of course prescription meds are only one part of the equation (in addition to diet, exercise, therapy, etc) but this was a miracle. I'm writing this to say to anyone who is curious about medication for OCD or anyone who is struggling in general, there is hope and if you are patient you will see the light and find something that works.

The first two weeks I felt absolutely terrible considered stopping the medication but I pushed through it, heard that was common. Absolutely worth it, because after that it started to do its job. This is the first SSRI I’ve ever taken so I don’t have any comparisons but I haven’t felt anxious in a couple of weeks at all. I still have the obsessive thoughts, but not the anxiety or the compulsions that came with it. I can finally get my work done. This has been truly a great drug however I’m now experiencing occasional derealisation, more frequently than I had before the medication but I’m not sure if it is actually because of the medication or something else. I still am happy with the results so I can’t be too upset about that. I can function and that’s what matters to me.",Kevin

A couple of years ago, I spiraled and became worse. The tipping point was dealing with mild DP/DR due to excessive anxiety. I avoided dealing with my anxiety head-on especially, as I didn't want to get on medication. Finally, I came around to it earlier this year. I titrated up over 2 months from 25mg to 100mg, which I'm currently on.Like many comments have indicated, it takes time, and you could need up until 100mg dose to feel better. Some of my early side-effects included mild insomnia, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. In retrospect, I would have gone on this medication sooner.

I started taking Zoloft/Sertraline in May 2021 for OCD. I have noticed improvements. Yes, I occasionally still have intrusive thoughts, however they’re much easier to disregard and move on from. I know that might sound discouraging, but it is about 60-75% better. I have been in therapy for my sudden OCD onset since 2019; ERP based, mindfulness based and all OCD specialists. Therapy is the answer to recovery, but after two years without significant improvement I agreed to take medication. I really did believe that I could therapy my OCD away, but I decided on quality of life over my judgements about medications. I’m happier now and more at peace. I don’t have any side effects besides some mild easy bruising. Choose your mental health over everything, you’re worth recovery and you’re worth feeling better.",Anonymous

Now I’m not completely symptom free but the destructive thoughts are not disturbing my mind anymore. At the first week of sertraline my anxiety got worse than before. Give it 4-6 weeks for all meds and try them until you find the right one for your body. Anafranil is a gold standard for OCD but it didn’t work for me.",Selectra

I was very afraid to take a high dose of Zoloft and should have increased much faster. My first therapist did not get it. I then found someone on the OCD foundation website who was a godsend. The combination of working with her on ERP and 100 mg Zoloft has me happier than I’ve ever been. It took about 4 months to see a significant difference. I have virtually no side effects.

I had several side effects. I encountered nausea, difficulty in sleeping and enhanced anxiety. This lasted about 2 - 3 weeks. Following this adjustment period, I began to feel much better. I now have an outstanding quality of life. I sleep really well and my anxiety is barely there. My OCD symptoms and intrusive thoughts are still present but not actually hindering me.

30,Sertraline,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,,"June 24, 2021",33,I have suffered with OCD for nearly 4 years. I found 200mg Sertraline to be the most effective drug. I had been prescribed other drugs but none as good. OCD is a horrible illness rooted in anxiety. Sertraline definitely helped lower my anxiety & thus make best use of CBT. For 3 years I despaired of ever getting better but the last year has been a turning point. For me once I had the right drug to reduce the anxiety I found it is possible to improve. I got to the point where it was a choice to either carry out a compulsion & knowing how bad I would feel afterwards that I had failed to stop yet again compared to not undertaking a compulsion & sitting with the anxiety until it reduced. Improving was not all plain sailing but I was determined to carry on reaching goals I never thought possible. I post this comment to give hope to other sufferers. I don't know if I will ever be free of OCD but am now at a point where it does not dominate - something I prayed for but thought would never happen.,Mac5

Since it stopped working I have tried every SSRI one would work for one thing but not the other. My doctor thought of trying Zoloft again-I was open to it. I started a therapeutic dose of Zoloft 50mg almost a month next weekend during the month he moved me to 75mg worsened anxiety. Tried me on 100mg anxiety to the point I couldn’t function.

As for tics, worsened significantly in the 1st few months; tics lasting for hours as opposed to originally just a few tics per day. Improved to a few tics every few days. Hoping they'll subside once my final dosage gets figured out.",Jrd

Anxiety went up like crazy when I first started at 50mg, and I was thinking this is not going to work, and that I should just get off the medicine. I stayed on strong with hope and 2 days ago I woke up feeling like my old self! I had a lot of energy, I did not have any anxiety at all, the racing thoughts in my head were gone to the point where I felt awesome! My old self is back within 2 weeks because of Zoloft. If you are concerned about this medicine, try it for at least a month if not longer, it gave me great results so far with no side effects, and it can do the same for you.",Anonymous

I felt better within a week, but it did take 3-4 weeks for me to notice its full effect. I'd describe the feeling it gives as light, airy and happy/drifty. I haven't experienced any side effects, and haven't gained any weight. On a side note, I also found that one huge factor contributing to my anxiety is too much caffeine, even when taking Zoloft (I still have one cup of coffee to wake up in the morning, but I've found that's my strict limit).",lavidadulce727

The sad part is you do have a trade off when you take these things. The good news is you can stop taking it for a couple days and then orgasm is normal as it has a short half life. Then go right back to normal on dosage. It quit working for me after about 16 months and nothing else worked so decided to just be without it. I would try it if you need to.,Anonymous
