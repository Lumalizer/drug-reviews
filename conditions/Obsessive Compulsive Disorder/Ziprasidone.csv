0,Ziprasidone,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 14, 2020",2,"This drug is a life ruiner, within few days of medication, it gave me a bad reaction with: blurred vision, headache, gastrointestinal issues, tremors, restless legs, nausea and of course, OCD.I've never ever had obsessive compulsive disorders since when I was a kid, but after this drug YES.I've tried several therapies, but none of them had success, after years I still haven't found a cure and I still suffer from OCD, with an inability to do everything. If I see a TV show, a game, Facebook, Internet, YouTube, Reading a book or an article, everything triggers obsessions and consequently compulsions. I live with constantly anxiety and fears, and the blame came all from this ""medicine"".I want my life back, my tranquillity back.Stay away from this drug if you want to live and safely.",Hopeless
1,Ziprasidone,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9,,"November 28, 2012",42,"Geodon (ziprasidone):Geodon is wonderful for me. For a very long my mind was cluttered with particular obsessions. I couldn't think straight. I've tried Luvox, Anafranil and a few other augmenters, nothing worked. Now, I take a low dose of Geodon 40mg a day with 300mg Luvox--and have success. It's not a total cure, but, I would say symptoms are 70-80% better.",Anonymous
