0,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2022",0,"I’ve struggled with anxiety depression and OCD  and insomnia from anxiety. I previously took sertraline or Zoloft. Citalopram has helped me so much! I finally feel HAPPY! Which is massive for me, my anxiety is also immensely better. Before I would cry very easily and just felt so overwhelmed. I felt like running away from life. Now I feel like a better mom and when I’m with my kids it’s like I can completely enjoy them. I realize it varies from person to person which drug works for you. My daughter 11 she takes sertraline and it has helped her a TON. Whereas it didn’t help me feel happy AT ALL.",J Laffoon
1,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 12, 2021",0,"I started citalopram in the third trimester of my pregnancy to try and help my extreme OCD. My OCD was mainly surrounding contaminated food so I was going days without eating. Since I was pregnant I didn’t have many options and I had already tried lexapro and prozac so I got put on this one. I didn’t have any side effects, but I started at 5mg for a week then moved to 10mg.  It took away some of my anxiety, enough where I was able to eat at least dinner and sometimes lunch, but it didn’t take away any of the thoughts or compulsions. I only got to 10mg of it because every time I went above that my OCD and anxiety got worse. Now that I’m not pregnant I’m being taken off this and being put on luvox as it is more directed for OCD.",lmh
2,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 18, 2021",0,"I suffer from ocd (checking), anxiety and occasional mild depression. I was put on 20mg but it had little effect. My dose was increased to 40mg and after its settled in my system I feel increased confidence and less anxiety than before. I can relax a bit better and handle things better. A negative however is an inability to orgasm but I'm hoping that will improve with time. As for my ocd it is better but I still perform checks.",Kram
3,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 31, 2021",4,"I'm on day 7 of my Citalopram medication. I've just completed the first week, I understand everyone's symptoms are different but reading very scary reviews about increasing anxiety and not being able to eat made me want to do this review to give others my experience in the first week, which is supposedly the hardest. I have never taken an SSRI before, only ever paracetamol and zapain so I had no idea how I'd react, I've started with 20mg for OCD & Paranoia. Day 1 & 2 I felt an instant decrease in my anxiety but I felt very sick, my head hurt and I had pains in the belly and back. Day 3 & 4 I was shattered, must have yawned at least 6 times an hour. I have one particular compulsion that takes me over an hour to complete and I HAVE to do it every single day or I have obsessive paranoia that something will go wrong. You can imagine my surprise when I went a whole 48 hours without doing it, after 5 days of these meds. I truly believe these will change my life for the better.",Olivia17
4,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 4, 2021",1,"2,4-2,5 weeks and still not even a small sign of improvement. I suffer from depersonalization/derealization for about 3 years or more and it keeps worsening. I don't know if it's the med itself worsening the condition or my issue. It's worsening in general but still nothing changed. I'm still having intrusive thoughts and no interest about life. First week I had some side effects that really bothered me but second week was totally fine. I really expect some improvement since I had a lot of side effects, I hope so...",SOT
5,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 12, 2021",2,"Made a big difference for me. Suffered from debilitating OCD for years, in and out of therapy. Finally in college my psychiatrist prescribed citalopram because a close family member has had success with it. After a few weeks on the meds I was back in business, baby! Only side effects I have are disturbing dreams, which aren't too hard to manage, and inability to orgasm, which is a worthwhile sacrifice (my partners are happy for sure).",Vog
6,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 5, 2021",5,I have OCD I take Citalopram. I was on 40 milligrams and learned I have AFib. My Doctor reduced to 20 milligrams and I am doing fine. I have been on Citalapram for about 10 years now. Prior on generic Paxil. It gave me an appetite. My former physician changed to Citalapram. Doing well on it.,Cheena
7,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 25, 2021",11,"I have harm OCD and only developed it recently. Citalopram helps to numb it, but gives me side effects such as insomnia and weirdly the inability to orgasm easily. But to be fair both are slight when compared to worrying I'm going to be of harm to the people I care about. Worth a try.",Jin
8,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,5.0,,"October 1, 2020",3,Before citalopram I have tried prozac and paxil for 20 mg which did nothing for my anxiety and OCD. I'm hopeless because of other medications but I will give a try to this drug citalopram. For now there are no side effects.,Kali
9,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 26, 2020",2,Celexa does virtually nothing for my OCD.  I'm looking for another medication for this condition.,Wabesabe
10,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 27, 2019",80,"I suffered from moderate OCD since childhood (62 now). I can control but sometimes it gets the best of me and I need medication. In past years, I was prescribed Xanax as needed.  I began having increased anxiety again in May. My doctor suggested citalopram once a day for long term therapy. After one week of 10mg, I literally forgot what why I was anxious. OCD creates irrational thoughts and I can't stop thinking of it which spawns anxiety. It's a horrible helpless feeling. The citalopram broke my irrational thought cycles. My side effects were mild. I began taking it in the morning, but after an hour, I felt somewhat woozy and tired. I tried taking at night before bed and I began having very weird dreams. No nightmares, but odd dreams that made me a bit uncomfortable that such things are lurking about in my psyche. I now take it about 6pm and really have no side effects.  I felt I should communicate my  experience so people won't get the impression that nobody gets positive results.",JH

12,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 21, 2019",24,"I got citalopram for OCD as well as some other stuff at age 16. Prozac and another medication did not work for me, but celexa helped me with no side effects. I am on the highest dose after 4 years of taking it and it does a pretty good job keeping the mental illness in its place. It was a very good stepping stone for me without the awful side effects of the other SSRIs I took :)",Anonymous
13,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 24, 2019",126,"I was completely over living before taking this drug. My anxiety, depression and OCD were so overpowering I just wanted it to end. I tried loads of different antidepressants before this that did nothing. I remember obsessively reading these reviews praying that this would work for me and it did. I started on 10mg and felt slightly better, then up to 20mg but as soon as I went up to 30mg I was pretty much cured. This took about 12 weeks to fully kick in and when it did I felt like my old self, no panic attacks, no anxiety, no depression and my OCD is about 90% better. This drug literally saved my life. Unfortunately I developed RLS but I would take that any day over the hell that was once my life. I’m so, so, so grateful for this medication. Please just take your meds and if this one doesn’t work for you I promise there is one that will, please don’t give up.",Rosepp
14,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,,"July 3, 2018",42,"I take Citalopram, but before I took it I had bad OCD, I'd make the bed as soon as I wake up even when people are in it. Washing hands for a long time. Doing everything 3 times in the shower. Brushing teeth twice in the morning and three times at night. And now I don’t do that anymore besides making my bed. I used to have anxiety and now it’s all away.",Gavin
15,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 10, 2017",32,"I was put on citalopram when I was 9 years old, and I am now 25. It was prescribed to me to help with panic attacks, OCD, and a phobia. According to my parents, the medication was effective within a week. I am not really sure if I have ever experienced side effects because of how young I was when I started. Citalopram greatly helps suppress panic attacks and intrusive thoughts for me. Instead of having panic attacks every day, now I only have them once every few months.Along with this medication, I also spent over a decade in therapy.Attempts to stop taking this medication caused anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and panic to interfere with my daily life.Citalopram works well for me, but results vary from person to person.",Sneff
16,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,2.0,,"February 19, 2017",18,"I took these for 3 days and felt completely out of it and utterly paranoid and much more depressed than before taking them. I had previously been on Sertraline which side effects only lasted a day for me and were pretty successfull long term. Citalopram did not agree with me at all and I feel I would have to go on sick from work to let them settle for which I have heard could be up to 5 weeks!Other symptoms I endured: not being able to eat for 3 days, diarhhea, buzzing in legs and arms, paranoia, zero interest in anything, being stuck in my thoughts (not where you want to be when depressed).I admit 3 days is not near enough time to allow it to settle but I would be jeapordizing my job by continuing this medication.",Lall2007
17,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 8, 2016",10,This is one of the worst drugs I have ever tried. I was on 60 mg and I don't recommend to go above 40 mg if you have bipolar it made me feel like a zombie and confused don't know whether I was happy or normal no emotions also gave me terrible vivid dreams every single day and thats bad and did nothing for my OCD but it may work for you I just gave my experience.,Heisenberg1100
18,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 20, 2016",11,"Not a hit with me, I'm afraid. Prescribed for my depression (doctor neglected to ask about any further symptoms and I was too embarrassed to share about my intrusive thoughts at the time). Caused some serious ticks including constant yawning, restless leg and twitching eye. I was twitching so badly I couldn't get to sleep, and I was exhausted constantly while on it (I was up for 3 days once!)The worst part was probably the severe sexual dysfunction, which, a year on, is still lingering around like a bad smell. I still struggle with physical pleasure, and to stay mentally and emotionally engaged in sex. It did dull my depression and intrusive thoughts to some extent, but it also dulled everything else.

The intrusive thoughts are significantly less already. The only side effect I am having is poor sleep. I wake up frequently or feel half asleep all night. Finally, I slept for a full night last night. Lexapro did not work for me, so they decided to try Celexa instead. Starting at 10mg. I am much less anxious.",hhjk178
20,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,,"June 21, 2016",68,"I went on paxil 20 mg for severe ocd. It was too much and I had bad side effects. Then clomipramine 250 mg which worked great. Came off and needed something cheaper. Today marks week 2 of being on citalopram and honestly everyday I feel better for longer. I still have my moments of anxiety but it went from 80% to 20% at most. It won't let me have a full blow panic attack. Also helped immensely with disassociation due to panic. And please remember, you can read all the reviews you want but your experience will be different. Please go to your doctor and start trying. Give it at least six weeks. Good luck! And remember loves try to stop googling.. it usually makes things worse.",Shib

24,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 7, 2015",33,"I have had anxiety/OCD for as long as I can remember. OCD seemed to come at day different times in my life and in different forms. My last episode 2011/2012 was very paralyzing. I had what I have seen described online as hit/run OCD. I won't go into length and description but you could google it. I was ready to commit myself but then my PCP convinced me to try a regimen of meds. I started out on 10mg of Celexa gradually moving to 40mg, Estrogen (hysterectomy) and .5 mg of Xanax up to three times per day. For the first 3/5 months I took the meds but using the Xanax at .25mg twice daily. I began to notice that things were becoming so much better. Today, 2015, still same meds but Xanax maybe 2/4 times a month and life is great.",Nanny67
25,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,,"February 18, 2015",98,After going through a series of tragic events I was clinically depressed.  My doctor put me on Citalopram for the depression.  I also told him that I thought I was also obsessive/compulsive since I just couldn't turn my brain off from going over negative events.  I felt like I was going insane.  He said that the Citalopram was also good for O/C disorder.  Although I don't usually like taking medication (don't even like to take an aspirin when I have a headache) I have found Citalopram to literally be a life saver.  I have not had any side effects whatsoever.  I work 14 hour days in the film industry and this medicine does not make me tired. I take 20 mg at night.,PM4ever

27,Citalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,,"January 26, 2014",85,"After having unsuccessfully tried Prozac, I was apprehensive about how effective Citalopram was going to be. It definitely takes a while (for me five weeks) before you notice the benefits, and I had the common side effect of severe nausea for the first few weeks. I don't want to wax lyrical but I can honestly say that it changed my life, I felt that the issues that I experienced which made everything seemingly impossible were no longer such a problem. I started to be able to live a normal life again, and felt a greater sense of control over the way I felt and acted. I would count it as one of the best decisions that I have ever made.",LaylaH585

Over the past 6 or so months, however, I've noticed it had become less effective and I eventually experienced the ""pop out"" effect. I am still taking it until I can see a psychiatrist, but the past few weeks have been agonizing.Overall, I would recommend it as an effective medication with very few side effects.

Obsessive thoughts occur very infrequently and when they do occur I am able to brush it off as the drug has reduced my anxiety.  My side effects of drowsiness lasted about one to two weeks.
