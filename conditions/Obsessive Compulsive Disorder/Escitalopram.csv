0,Escitalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 1, 2022",1,"I have been on Escitalopram for 12 weeks now. I started at 10 mg, and then my PCP increased the dosage to 15 mg after 4 weeks (which helped after 5 days of worsening symptoms).  This medicine does take time to work. It took about 6-8 weeks until I really felt a difference, and then I continued to see improvement with each passing week.  I have sudden-onset Pure OCD with horrible, distressful intrusive thoughts. Escitalopram really worked to decrease my anxiety surrounding the intrusive thoughts, and my disturbing thoughts have decreased significantly as well. The main side effect I experienced was dry mouth (which has gone away). I also pray A LOT and trust in the Lord who has helped me through this difficult season…so thankful for Him. I also have really worked to see my thoughts for what they are…just thoughts…and I really try to disregard/ignore them which has helped, too.",Anonymous
1,Escitalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 5, 2022",0,"I've been on escitalopram for 11 weeks in total going from 5mg to 10mg and now to 15mg. Almost 5 weeks (in 2 days)  on 15mg. I have pure O, had it off and on in bouts/waves since I was around 9 years old. Escitalopram has helped me get from one of my worst lows to almost normalcy again and I am really thankful. I'm wondering if it will be even better at 20mg but I'm going to stay at 15mg until I notice my anxiety more. My intrusive thoughts have really diminished, and they are a lot quieter now and easier to brush off (they aren't completely gone though). There were times where I thought it wasn't working fast enough, and when I first started it my anxiety did get worse but only for a few days from what I remember. Going up to 15mg also made my anxiety go up a little I think, but I know this really depends on the individual. Just for reference I've only been taking meds, not been going to therapy at the same time. Do whatever works for you! Thanks to everyone who posts their experiences!",Fourleafclover

3,Escitalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 26, 2022",0,I hesitated for a couple of years on taking escitalopram but after a second Doctor recommended it I thought I should at least try it. How glad I am that I did! Having tried many other SSRI's I've dealt with many unwanted side effects. So far the side effects have been minimal to none. I had some digestive discomfort the first week or so but that went away. I also dealt with insomnia. I noticed that the insomnia had like a delayed effect for me. So taking it in the morning like my doctor had prescribed caused the insomnia to kick in right at bed time. So I started taking it right at bedtime and I fall fast asleep and sleep all through the night. I'm the type of person that can't fall asleep easily so it has been amazing that it helps me fall right to sleep and stay asleep. And then by morning I'm ready to go for the day. I deal with bad intrusive thoughts and OCD. Specifically relationship OCD and retroactive jealousy OCD. It has helped so much. I highly recommend!,Heather

6,Escitalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,,"January 14, 2022",1,"After a move a few months ago, I developed severe anxiety, depression, panic attacks and while I haven’t officially been diagnosed, I know I have OCD (I’ll check repeatedly if my I unplugged my straightener or I’ll have intrusive thoughts that I obsess over throughout the day). Well my Dr. started me on 5mg of escitalopram then to 10mg. I’m now at 15mg which was just upped 3 days ago. My first three weeks I had a lot of ups and downs (I’m only in the middle of week 5 of starting the medication). But eventually the side effects started to subside. Now that my dose has been upped, I notice some of the side effects are back to an extent (anxiety, obsessive thoughts…) I’m hoping these side effects are just temporary like when I first started taking it. Has anyone else experienced this? I can’t wait to get back to living my life again!!! I keep reading everyone’s positive reviews and it really helps!",Rmpass

9,Escitalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 3, 2021",5,"I'm 34, and I had anxiety and OCD my whole life, but it never limited my life and I always believe those who were limited by such problems were weak. Life came to give me a lesson, after I saw Alzheimer in my family, I began to question my sanity, and then all the strategies I had my whole life didn't work. I felt so low. Luckily, I'm not someone who is afraid of drugs and to ask for help, so I almost immediately did. I was put on 10mg of Escitallopram for a week, then 20mg. I'm now on 2 months. First 2 weeks were worse, and thanks to this website, the feedbacks of others, I got hope. The first 3 days, I was the most depressed of my life (didn't even want to answer when someone spoke to me). But after 2 weeks, I started to see a relief, and now after 2 months, I can finally believe I will have my life back.I recommend having a psychological expert to help, the key is simple but hard: resilience: accepting we are vulnerable and must accept we can't control everything.",HangInThere

11,Escitalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 20, 2021",5,"Short Answer: From my experience, the escitalopram does work. I currently intake a 10mg sized escitlopram, and it does its job continuously as I take it every morning when I wake up.Long Answer: I've experienced with both a 5mg size and 10mg size of a escitalopram. I haven't used the 5mg size as prominent as I have with the 10mg size to give my full thoughts on that size, but I can tell you that the 10mg size does work. I take it every morning as soon as I wake up, swallowing it with my saliva or if it doesn't go down all the way, I'd make it go all the way down my throat with a bit of water (never a lot). I didn't notice at first, but after awhile, I realized I haven't been much anxious or fearful as I used to, and that my head had been less busier. After noticing, I could then say that the escitalopram was working, and treats my OCD. It's been so long since I've experienced symptoms of my OCD that I forgot a bit of how it tortured me.",MysteryScheme
12,Escitalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 18, 2021",14,"I have dealt with OCD, anxiety, and depression pretty much my whole life. For the past two months, I had been at the lowest point ever in my life. I had no more enjoyment in life and I was so close to falling off the edge. Now about two weeks on lexapro (10 mg) I feel amazing…..the happiness I feel now is something that I have never experienced ever, it almost feels like a high. Along with that, my obsessions and intrusive thoughts still come (not as often) but I don’t obsess and ponder on them. Lexapro saved my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Remember, it gets worse before it gets better. Stay well!",Kaden
13,Escitalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 11, 2021",5,"I'm writing this review after coming to this website when I was prescribed Lexapro in May 2021 at the age of 31. My whole life I have suffered from horrible bouts of crippling anxiety and intrusive thoughts without ever knowing what was wrong. In February of 2021 my anxiety and intrusive thoughts were so crippling that I could no longer function normally since I was consumed by the intrusive thoughts - I considered quitting my job, leaving my boyfriend and couldn't socialize. After speaking to a psychiatrist I learned that I was facing SO OCD, ROCD, False Memory OCD and Real Event OCD. She put me on 5 mg of Lexapro and have since bumped it up to 20 mgs, which I feel is the right dose for me since I am now able to live my life and experience happiness. Relief is definitely not instant, however, and I want to underscore the fact that, at least for me, medicine MUST be coupled with an experienced psychologist who practices CPT & ERP. My only side effects have been sweating and tiredness.",CaliVallie
14,Escitalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 20, 2021",1,"I took Lexapro for two years when I was 14-15 and I had a pretty mixed experience with it. I took it to manage my OCD symptoms, and to this day it was the best medication to control my physical tics (for lack of a better word) and anxious thoughts from ocd. The problem happened at the start of my freshman year of high school. I’m not sure if Lexapro was the sole cause or if it only pushed along/prolonged the effects, but I became very depressed. The main depression lasted for about 6 months. After about six months of this my mom had a thought, why don’t you try not taking your Lexapro for a week or two?. I wasn’t convinced that it would help but it was easy enough to test, and a week later I realized that while still depressed, I was much less depressed than before. Basically Lexapro had a big part in my depression. So, Lexapro works, but you NEED to look out for warning signs that it’s making you depressed. If you can do that there should be no problems.",Ellie
15,Escitalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 11, 2021",2,"I've been taking lexapro for a few months now for GAD, depression, and OCD and it has genuinely worked wonders! I was extremely hesitant to start medication but my therapist felt that it would greatly benefit me since they were all affecting every aspect of my life. The first few times I took it I was a little drowsy, but that went away quickly. And sometimes if I dont eat anything I get a small tummy ache. I started with a dosage of 5mg, which was then increased to 10mg for a while. I noticed that it was helping my depression and GAD a bit, but my OCD was still pretty severe. I then increased to 15mg, and now am on 20mg and let me just say that I feel great. Even when increasing the dosage I barely had any side effects. Increasing my dosage has done wonders for my intrusive thoughts. They're not intense anymore and I'm able to deal with them when I get them. I also noticed I dont really do my compulsions anymore, and if I do I am also able to talk myself out of needing to do them.",Ihavemylifeback

17,Escitalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 13, 2021",3,"I've been struggling with Harm OCD for five years. It comes and goes in episodes. I experienced my third major episode two weeks ago and immediately had to start again with Lexapro like I did previous times. This time I had to start on 20mg to have quicker and more effect.After 1,5 weeks of taking the medicine I already feel much better, thoughts still come and sometimes they still scare me but I'm now much more able to let them come and go and not overreact or go into panic.I'll ask my doctor to go down to 10 or even 5mg in a few months as I don't want to build tolerance, but for now this medicine really helps me to be able to live again a normal life instead of always obsessing about the thoughts and the what if questions.I only have one side effect: less libido and more difficult to ejaculate, but compared to the improved quality of life I'll take these side effects anytime above OCD.",Jay
18,Escitalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 27, 2021",5,So far it's been about 12 days on this medicine. Not long enough to give a decent review however I just wanted to say to any one struggling with PURE O  I'm with you. I took zoloft for 3 and 1/2 years it worked kept the intrusive thoughts at bay. However I stopped to get pregnant but then the pandemic hit and we decided to wait... Tried to take it again and it didn't work this time it gave me more anxiety. I also tried luvox which was too strong for me a lot of side effects. Flash forward to now I'm stuck in a severe ocd episode. I started at 10mg and for about 5 days I've been @ 20mg no major side effects except more anxiety and more intrusive thoughts. It's also hard to get out of bed in the morning. I really just wanted to say if your struggling in the first few weeks like me. Hang in there! I know it takes 5-8 weeks or longer...I'm praying we can all get over this hurdle and back to feeling like ourselves! God bless you all,I'm not my OCD

20,Escitalopram,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,9.0,,"March 5, 2021",27,"If you’re struggling right now with OCD I sympathize with you because I know how hard it is. But you’re not alone, and there is hope. I am 24 years old, and I have been having symptoms of Pure O for the past few years. September of 2020 things got a lot worse. My doctor prescribed me 2.5 mg of Lexapro. Honestly I was pretty miserable for the first couple of months from September-November. I remember being extremely emotional and reacting heavily to my intrusive thoughts. Eventually I got up to 10mg and then 20mg. Around the end of December is when I finally noticed I was getting better. I’ve been on 20 mg now for about a few months, and I feel completely different. The thoughts don’t 100% go away, but do reduce a lot. I am much happier now. I have accepted that I will never be cured, but I can still live a great life. If you want to get on lexapro, just go into it by starting on a low dose, be patient, and work with your doctor to get to where you need to be.",Rose

My fingertips were constantly sore. I was always chewing and yanking at bits of nail and tough skin.About seven years ago I started on escitalopram 20mgs and then we went to 30mgs.  I'd say that within two weeks I stopped chewing my nails! I mean, now I have to trim my nails! It is amazing how useful finger nails are.  I no longer have stubbing fingers or painful infections.

I experienced horrible intrusive thoughts, insomnia, and fear. I was prescribed Lexapro. After 2 weeks I noticed significant relief. However, I began to gain weight, experience sexual side effects, and hair loss. Yet, the intrusive thoughts faded along with the anxiety and depression, making it a worthwhile trade off. Due to weight gain, I switched to Zoloft. Gradually I tapered off the Zoloft, but my symptoms returned. I tried using vitamins and amino acids (result of Y-tube and online research..beware) to no avail. I began taking Zoloft again, but experienced terrible side effects, increased anxiety, insomnia, nervousness, and panic. I kept reading it gets worse before it gets better"". But after weeks of pure torture, I switched back to Lexapro. After one week, my anxiety level decreased. I have now been on Lexapro for 4 weeks and noticed increased improvement each week.",Nana

AND I developed panic disorder on this. I've always had panic attacks, but usually only a few per year. With this med there were times that for 2 weeks at a time, daily I'd wake up and have a panic attack lasting 1-8 hours. Yes 8 hours in a full blown panic attack with all the classic symptoms.Getting off the meds over 6 weeks: the first 2 dose decreases, my OCD actually improved 3%, but once I got down to 5mg and 0mg, the withdrawal hit me: Daily panic attacks, headache, nausea, stomach issues, floating head, insomnia, short tempered, lack of cognition, suicidal ideation.Gene testing like genesight: you can't rely on the info they give you.

This medication has given me the opportunity to be happy, something that my OCD always prevented me to do before. My relationship centred OCD is virtually gone, and when it does rear it’s ugly head, it’s easy to push aside.  2 years later and this was one of the best decisions that I’ve ever made.

I always felt it was somehow my conscience trying to get me to live differently. I always felt guilty and paranoid about how I was living.It is only in the last year or so, that it occurred to me that I actually might have a more severe case of OCD than I thought. It is not anything obvious, but I know that I spend hours a day with my lists of things. I don't have friends although I am very friendly. I can't ""waste my time."" I don't get out a lot. I usually notice my ""panic attacks"" occurred after having had some alcohol, although often not a lot.I have become afraid of the night coming because then if I get an attack, I cannot talk to people, I cannot drive places, do stuff to distract my brain. The main thing is that I cannot sleep or even try to lay my head down because if I do not distract my brain, the terrifying feeling overcomes me. I will be exhausted but afraid to lie down. My attacks have started to last throughout the day because I sense that total unbearable fear of things I cannot control or are futile. For example, never speaking to my ex again, the unbearable thought of my mother passing away, even little stuff like where I lost a pair of glasses. Terrifying! I never thought my panic attack symptoms  were like the classic ones I’ve been reading about-no racing heart, just an absolute paranoia and NOW I HAVE concluded that my problem is related to my OCD.

It does help with my anxiety levels most of the time. However, it doesn't really effect my OCD. I just got put on 30 mg, which I started today and am skeptical about it. I don't want to feel like a zombie all day, or wake up everyday with horrible depersonalization. Overall it is okay for reducing anxiety.",ClickyMonster

I am doing fine, but back when I first started my Paxil in 2009, I had an initial spike in anxiety; I had upped my dose too soon on the advice of a social worker without checking with my doctor, and I was extremely anxious, so I took Xanax temporarily with the Paxil, and I gradually started feeling better over a few weeks, and over the years Paxil has helped.
