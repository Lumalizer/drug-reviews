0,Azithromycin,Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare Treatment,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 10, 2021",1,"Zithromax (azithromycin):I have been taking azithromycin for 3 weeks and take it 3 times per week. My doctor recommended that I take it with yogurt. The yogurt helps coats my stomach to keep it from getting upset. So far, it has worked. I also make sure that I drink lots of water when taking this medication and rinse my mouth well. Hopefully, rinsing will keep me from getting mouth sores.",Anonymous

2,Azithromycin,Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare Treatment,7.0,,"January 13, 2009",17,"Zithromax (azithromycin):I have been taking this on a weekly basis for the past 8 months but I noticed that in the last three weeks it's been giving me diarrhea the moment I take it. It just goes right through me.  This medication is effective, but you have to make sure your body can handle it.  I did, for a while, until recently.",Anonymous
