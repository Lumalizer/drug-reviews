2,Plaquenil,Dermatomyositis,8,,"January 28, 2014",19,I have dermatomyositis.  Plaquenil along with quinicrine treated my hand lesions which were very painful.  This took about a year to accomplish.  It's been about a year and a half now and I'm starting to react to one or both of the medications.  I have a rash all over my body and ulcers and lichen planus in my mouth.  I'm seeing my doctor shortly to see about this.,Lou 2
3,Plaquenil,Dermatomyositis,10,,"November 18, 2009",41,"The drug Plaquenil was used faithfully for three months for the treatment of sarcoidosis. My scalp was ozing, flaking and overwhelmed with hyperpigmented lesions. The hair was approximately 1/4 inch in length due to the severity of the outbreak. My scalp has healed and the hair is now 6 inches long. The Plaquenil allowed my scalp to resume normal hair growth.",Just Happy
