0,Mycophenolate mofetil,Dermatomyositis,10,,"October 14, 2009",21,Have been treated for Atopic Dermatomyositis since 1994 with a variety of drugs. Mycophenolate combined with small dosage of Prednisone (3 or 4 mg) have kept skin clear and relatively unaffected for past 5 years. Muscle enzymes quickly elevate if I cut back from two to one 250 mg capsule per day.,Anonymous
