0,Methotrexate,Dermatomyositis,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 1, 2021",1,It took a good year from my first symptoms (body rash that itched like crazy!) to getting a rheumatologist.   He started with plaquenil then started me on 20mg of methotrexate which finally cleared up my facial redness.  I was able to start working out regularly again and my bumps on my knuckles went away too.   It did work for me but I do have side affects as well.  I have about 12-24 hours of feeling kinda crappy after my weekly metho dose.   But I am thankful for how it has cleared many of my DM symptoms.   As the years go on I have noticed a slight lapse in efficacy but it still does a good job.,Colorado DM patient
1,Methotrexate,Dermatomyositis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 14, 2020",5,"I was put on methotrexate for Dermatomyositis and it made me very sick! A low dose once a week did nothing to me but it didn’t help either then I was put on a higher dose and I was unable to get out bed except for the restroom and to shower with help. I felt like I had a really bad case of the flu but worse. I had red patches all over me and chills, fever and the patches on my skin were very hot. There was no in between dose for me. Methotrexate just didn’t work out for me.",Anonymous
