0,Amitriptyline,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,4.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 3, 2021",8,"I was on this drug for 7 months - it was amazing at first. It turned me from someone who was triggered and in severe emotional pain constantly, into a fully functional adult. BUT it reaaaally messed with my cognitive ability, I couldn't remember certain words, I forgot how to spell despite always being great at English...it was really concerning. I've since found out it has anticholinergic properties, which can affect your memory. It also messed with my heart - I had a prolonged qt signal and my resting heart rate was around 120. I've now changed to mirtazapine which I've heard great things about, please please be careful with this medication.",Magamufin

2,Amitriptyline,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,1.0,,"June 8, 2019",22,"My doc prescribed amitriptyline to  help me sleep, I have high anxiety or am  stressed out or in panic mode. So took it for two or three years three  four pills a day. I think it was 25mg. My heart started pounding out of control. In the ambulance my bpm (heart beats per minute) was 160 plus, paramedic was injecting some drug to slow my heart down and he asked what drugs was I taking I said amitriptyline, he said that drug causes the organ that controls the heart rate not to function properly and he said stop taking it. They were now aware of what it does to the heart. So after the first injection I felt my heart slow way down, then a few minutes later still driving to the hospital my heart ran over 160 bpm again so he injected the IV with a drug can't remember the name of it, it slowed my heart again to normal. Thank goodness for that paramedics training and quick action. Look I would not recommend this drug to anyone. I have never had a heart problem ever. I quit taking this that day and never took it again.",Gerald
3,Amitriptyline,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,,"February 9, 2019",15,"Hyperthryoid, PTSD. Have been on benzos for years to control ""panic disorder, unspecified"" and while Xanax kept me functional, in PTSD therapy I realized an old incident might have caused my thyroid to go nuts and put me in the ER a lot. I didn't want to be ""stuck"" carrying Xanax for instant relief of unexplained panic attacks (I'm not in the least bit ""anxious"", or depressed, but have been prone to ""panic"" daily for years, and didn't know why). Everything else made me more anxious or put me in the ER (even with Xanax). When I was finally diagnosed PTSD, I begged for Elavil after researching, and immediately felt the difference. I don't know how it works, but Elavil's the ONLY one I've felt could take the place of Xanax. A little worried about ""swapping dependencies,"" but this kind of ""calm"" seems worth it. I still have Xanax (and propanolol for high heart rate, which I had moments after swallowing Elavil), but am taking them ""in taper mode"".",ThyroidGirl
4,Amitriptyline,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 28, 2019",31,"Throughout my life, I've been prescribed so many different medications for my C-PTSD (Complex post traumatic stress disorder ) and every single thing I tried seemed to make things worse except Amitriptyline for C-PTSD. 31 years old and in ER for being suicidal when this awesome doctor tells me about amitriptyline. It took a few weeks to notice a difference, but once this stuff kicked in I noticed a massive difference in the way I felt. I got some actual SLEEP for the first time in as long as I could remember. My emotions levelled out, my brain fog cleared up, my ability to deal with everyday life situations improved, I mean it's just unbelievable. The med isn't without downsides. If for any reason you suddenly stop taking this and have to go without for a couple days you're going to be a horrendously awful person to deal with because of the withdrawal from this med causing an emotional rollercoaster of anger!!! It's pretty crazy. I don't ever want to be without this medication again. <3",melmoldy
5,Amitriptyline,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 3, 2018",52,"Elavil (amitriptyline):I've had Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) for 30 years, then a random workplace mass shooting gave me PTSD about 16 years ago. I was on many different drugs from a psychiatrist (probably getting kickbacks). After I lost my job, ability to work, house, wife, etc. I was fortunate to be poor and prescribed a drug I could afford by a nurse practitioner with advice from a neurologist. To add to my klonopin they prescribed elavil. I slept like a baby for the first time in years. It helped with anxiety and depression, improved my libido, and I will be happy to take it the rest of my life. I have been on it over ten years now, I still struggle, but I would never have managed without it. It gives me a fighting chance at a real life. SSRI's and anti-psychotic drugs are demonic.",ez_writer

I have tried every kind of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. Sometimes with absolutely horrible side effects.

9,Amitriptyline,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 20, 2016",25,"Elavil (amitriptyline):The first time I was aware of the existence of this drug, a gastroenterologist gave it to me for sharp stomach pain. The cause was idiopathic and/or overdetermined by a variety of problems, especially some damage to the hypothalamus. That was in 2001, and worked IMMEDIATELY. Stomach pain? Gone. Only had about a 2-week supply and stopped with no ill effects. In fact, it perked up my mood! I always remembered that this was the drug that solved a serious pain problem. In 2015, I had severe anxiety & my appetite was completely gone. I knew what I needed. The psych. gave me Elavil, even though he was inclined toward Effexor. I ate! I felt good again. I am still on it. I am concerned re: withdrawal. Short-term use recommended if possible.",High Anxiety
10,Amitriptyline,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 16, 2016",14,"I've been in law enforcement for almost 24 years.  I've sustained two broken hips, dislocated SI joint, 8 concussions, and numerous stab and knife wounds.  I've been given Amitriptyline before, with no help for PTSD.  On June 16, 2015 I received my 8th concussion. My PTSD intensified as this injury is a severe one, and I was given klonapin for PTSD as the Amitriptyline did nothing.  Since then, I've been on both as I required surgery to remove two nerves in my neck as well as surgery to remove scar tissue from my spine.  At 50mg, the Amitriptyline has done nothing for PTSD, but works for the remining nerve pain pain, though no help in sleeping.",BruceWayneofGotham
11,Amitriptyline,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 3, 2016",27,"Was prescribed 25mg for post traumatic stress from a motorcycle vs. Drunk driver wreck I survived.  I also have insomnia and panic/anxiety attacks as a result.  I had negative experiences with Xanax. So started amitript 25mg did nothing for me, kept me awake, even.  50mg helped a little (5-6 hours of sleep).  I went back to the doc and he said 'a guy your size, try taking 2 50mg before bed' (I weight 215).  I took 2 while making dinner and could barely keep my head up while eating.   I slept 10 hours straight!  This is fantastic as I have 'interrupted sleep cycles' where my body comes out of REM sleep from the PTSD.  Doc says I need 10-12 hours of sleep on a good night.  I like that it's not addictive as well.",Million dollar man
