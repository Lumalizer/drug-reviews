1,Aripiprazole,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 28, 2021",1,"This drug has given me myself and my life back pre-PTSD and I am so thankful that my psychiatrist put me on this. I am currently taking 100mg of zoloft in conjunction with 5mg of the abilify and it is truly a miracle cocktail. I no longer have intrusive and disturbing thoughts, emotional flashbacks and my PTSD stuck points are less sticky, and I am able to fully participate in my life each day. I hope this drug is as helpful for others as it has been for me",G
2,Aripiprazole,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 16, 2020",1,I did not find this medication to be helpful at all with PTSD symptoms. I also caused me to start developing the side effect of tardive dyskinesia symptoms.,Starbucks
3,Aripiprazole,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,1,,"March 2, 2020",7,"I was on Abilify & after a rough few weeks I was great. Unfortunately due to my insurance, I had to switch to Aripiprozole and that was horrible. I had anxiety, paranoia, and night terrors. I feared losing my job because of the side affects I was experiencing. After reading these reviews, along with others, I know this does not happen to everyone. Although I do believe more people should be made aware if this medication created these side effects. I felt worse than I had in a long time.",Kds
4,Aripiprazole,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 30, 2019",10,"I felt great for about 3 weeks. Now, I've gained about 10 pounds in 2 months and am as depressed as one might be if their loved ones died. I don't know what this is doing to my brain but I have never felt depression like this before. I'm so tired I can hardly move. I'm weak. I'm basically useless because of the side effects.",Beemzo
5,Aripiprazole,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 6, 2019",18,"My psychiatrist started me on 2.5mg to supplement my SSRI. Within about a day or two I started experiencing a period of what was probably hypomania; many told me I looked happy. I almost completely stopped picking at my scalp and hair. (About a 85% reduction.) My PTSD had been a nightmare. When at the gym, men would often walk behind me on the elliptical and would often look at my rear, and I'd feel triggered and panicked. On Abilify, I was aware but no longer triggered by threats to my space such as this. I also felt less powerful urges to self-harm, which were rather distressing before starting this drug.Long-term:I'm less severely depressed!I also noticed that I stopped having fights with my S.O., probably because I felt less threatened by micro-events.The only downside - I've put on about 10lb. However, my doc put me on Metformin as a way to counteract some of the metabolic effects.",rachelxsutton
6,Aripiprazole,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 7, 2018",17,"I don’t know how to explain how incredible I feel since being on 2mgs for only 5,6 days.I was under extreme stress for years & became totally frozen with fear, anxiety, major depression and was spinning out of control. I worked with my psychiatrist, gave her my exact symptoms. She was just so understanding, as I am not a huge proponent of psychopharmacology, nor have I ever taken something so strong.Im using less pain medication, I’m running again, I’m waking up and able to get out of bed, which I haven’t been in so long ...I’m losing weight which feels miraculous....I feel miraculous! This drug is giving me my life back!",FLSunshine
7,Aripiprazole,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9,,"June 23, 2017",14,My 14 year old daughter and I were hit head-on by a drunk driver on Xmas Eve of 2015. We both spent weeks in the hospital and she sadly passed 6 months later. I subsequently went into a downward spiral and tested positive for PTSD. 1 mg of Abilify per day has seemingly been transformative. Within a week my symptoms were cut in half. They were reduced further after another week. I am now on week three and doing even better. My only reservation is that I don't sleep as well and have had a few insomniac nights. I'm going to start taking it in the morning and see if that helps.,Theologicae
8,Aripiprazole,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,1,,"December 2, 2016",4,"I've been clean for almost 4 yrs. 1st time in my life. I got off all these medications because I was so messed up.I had a Combination of the diagnosis listed and PTSD.  When I detoxed I was blessed to be in a facility that took me off all of the meds. I was taking for all my diagnosis. Replaced it all with exercise, NA mtgs., working with my sponsor, my therapist and talking to my Hp everyday. The first yr. I was so out of it but I eventually felt so much better. This medication caused me to become manic, having anxiety attacks, my upper abdomen became distill, I became incontinent and couldn't go poo to save my life. Basically, I went back to Oaklawn and was honest with the pysiciatrist I have now and I told her how hard I was working to not have to go back to having to put this crap in me.",Chris st.3216

10,Aripiprazole,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8,,"February 7, 2012",17,"Abilify Discmelt (aripiprazole):Had simmilar antipsychotic effects of Seroquel, and yet had far less sedative and flattening effects on the psyche. A great alternative to other medications with similar applications.",ptsd
11,Aripiprazole,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8,,"April 20, 2011",15,Abilify (aripiprazole):So far I would recommend taking this at night.  Instead of having insomnia it made me very sleepy.,bandit64
12,Aripiprazole,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,7,,"August 27, 2010",21,"Abilify (aripiprazole):While this medicine helped, and really did snuff out the symptoms associated with my trauma disorder. It also had so many side effects. Taking it would put me into a sleepy sort of fog, and felt very out of it. We then tried Minipress, and have had much more success with that. I now use Abilify as an emergency medicine. It acts as a great last resort to stop all of the overly emotional symptoms associated with an attack/flash back, and helps put you back in a better place, even if it gets a bit foggy.  I haven't used it for a couple weeks now, but I haven't also worked on the trauma issues for a while as well. I'd give it a 10 for rare emergency use, and a 5 for day to day use due to its side effects, thus the 7",jk13
13,Aripiprazole,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9,,"July 23, 2010",13,"Post Traumatic Stress Disorder was the most awful thing that I've ever experienced, bringing me back to terror unlike anything I've felt for over 15 years. My love for my kids saved my life. I already have depression, Fibromyalgia, SAD, many anxiety types, and likely narcolepsy, currently taking 8 medicines that did nothing for the trauma. Only 2mg of Abilify stopped all of the symptoms, but made me very tired, falling asleep at 8pm (Narcolepsy). Other than that, I regard this medication as being extremely effective. I had bad side effects (even more sleepy) but took 7 days to lessen (now less sleepy than before), unlike the 2 days typical of these medicines.",jk13
