0,Fluvoxamine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 21, 2021",3,"I had emetophobia and PTSD, took lexapro at first but felt extremely nauseous which triggered my phobia. Then switched to fluvoxamine, only sleepiness and dizziness at the first two weeks, and slight nausea which was totally bearable. It worked after a month on 50mg (combined with 15mg mirtazapine), the somatization faded and I felt much more calm when facing triggers or traumatic memories.",xiaotiantian
1,Fluvoxamine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,,"December 23, 2020",4,"I was having extreme chronic suicidal ideations that were getting more frequent and intense. I just started this medication last week after trying a long list of things that had not worked. I am feeling so much relief, I never knew it was possible to not feel so flooded with emotions all the time. I was having suicidal thoughts almost ever 15 mins and now I have peace. They're finally gone. I didn't know how much longer I could take, this drug truly saved my life.",strawberry

4,Fluvoxamine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 9, 2019",2,"Started off with Trintellix. It helped a little but was weak. Then I went on Risperdal and depakote for a bit that helped. Don't take the Risperdal anymore nor do I need it. Finally, added Luvox 150mg which helped with ruminating and thinking about the trauma. No medication is perfect though. I had horrible thoughts once in the beginning but it wore off. Also, for me it didn't completely remove the ruminating.",Nick
5,Fluvoxamine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8.0,,"May 13, 2018",22,"This medication has worked wonders for me. I stopped cipramil which I had been on for 10 years as I was chronically depressed, drinking all day and startled at any noise, afraid of everything. I couldn't shop, cook, sleep or care for myself. I developed PTSD from work and was medically retired. After a stint in a psych ward I was slighter better but still chronically depressed with intrusive thoughts, panic attacks and sense of dread, obsessive loop thoughts and ruminating that I could not stop. I decided cipramil was no longer working. At first I felt great but then crashed at 4 weeks. My Psychiatrist put me on Luvox. It took two weeks and I smiled and laughed for the first time in four years. This was three months ago. Already I am a different person. I cook, I can go to shops and nothing worries me as it did before. I am so grateful for this drug and for my recovery back into life again.",Jenji
6,Fluvoxamine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,,"March 20, 2017",13,"I was recovering from severe PTSD linked to bipolar 2 and autism spectrum disorder. I lived in a sort of dual reality, with violent images of past trauma continually playing into the present. Every thought stopping technique and medication failed to solve the problem until Fluvoxamine was added to the mix. For me, it stopped the images immediately. I was finally able to smile again! And I do not recall experiencing any particular side effects. Of course, I always insisted that my doctors start me on low doses, as side effects were a definite concern. Everyone is different. But for intrusive thoughts and images, I would definitely recommend that this medicine be given a try. What does not work at all for some may work wonders for others!",RHB1

8,Fluvoxamine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,5.0,,"October 6, 2015",14,"My husband is a Vietnam veteran and has been on this for 15 years. In the last 5 years he has been kicking and punching and twitching in his sleep. He is now developing other signs of of neurological disorders. The doctor gave us a print out today and Luvox is a SSSR drug and they have recently found it causes Parkinsonism and when dosages are reduced or patient taken off this drug, the symptoms go. It works great for his depression, it helps reduce the symptons of PTSD but now his health is suffering from long term usage.",Willow2014
9,Fluvoxamine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 15, 2013",7,"After an incident which involved a family member who was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia, I was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder . Throughout my life (25 yrs), I've felt slight symptoms of anxiety that became perpetuated by post traumatic stress disorder. I experienced feelings of intense fear over nothing, obsessive intrusive thought I could not control, and so on. My doctor put me on 150 mg of Luvox. I did not want to take it because I had never taken medication. At first I became more depressed and had horrible obsessive thoughts of someone attacking me. I told my doctor this and she assured me that it is normal and told me to stick with the medication. I stuck with it and now I feel better than before. Only side effects are sexual and some trouble sleeping.",Pumazi
