0,Quetiapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 31, 2022",0,I take 50mg quetiapine and 20mg of escitalopram each night. After a traumatic birth I ended up in a mom and baby psychiatric unit due to unbearable anxiety and symptoms of PTSD. I've gone from having constant panic attacks all throughout the day and night to having 0 panic attacks for 5 weeks. I've also been able to eat a normal healthy diet unlike before hand as I wouldn't be able to stomach a thing for up to a week at a time. I have been taking the escitalopram for around 8 weeks but my anxiety attacks didn't completely stop so I started the  quetiapine to fill the gaps and it truly has worked wonders for me! I've had no side effects apart from being a bit restless the first few nights of taking it and being slightly groggy the next morning for the first week or so!,hxllystrxng
1,Quetiapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 9, 2022",0,"After a lifetime of stressful events (teaching career, family issues and love tangles) and a resulting desire to self-harm I finally realized that there was something wrong that I couldn't resolve on my own.I was referred by my NHS GP for counselling and put on Fluoxetine for depression. I still suffer anxiety though and was this week prescribed Quetiapine at 12.5mg at night. No side effects so far and less worry but it's a low dose and early days. It seems that therapy is more about managing things/events rather than a complete cure.So far I'm sleeping more easily and feel more confident but I still can't catch a bus or go to the shops. I'm jittery when speaking and am happiest when sleeping or reading a book.Best wishes from the UK to all the Vets and readers on this thread - stay strong and keep healing.",ronald.arthur

3,Quetiapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 3, 2021",0,"About six years ago I had a terrible episode while taking oral steroids for a major asthma flare. I developed severe anxiety and panic on high doses of steroids. My doctor suggested I take a very small amount of Seroquel. I am very sensitive to medication‘s so she started with the 25 mg tiny pill and I cut it into quarters (yes that’s how sensitive I am to meds). Just taking a quarter pill of Seroquel helped calm the severe anxiety and panic. The first dose I took was half of the 25 mg pill, and I was sedated within 10 minutes!  Now years later I’m having the same side effect from oral steroids due to an asthma treatment and my doctor called in Seroquel 25 mg. Again I am to cut it in half or quarters to start. I am baffled by the people who take hundreds of milligrams of this drug a day. I don’t know how they function or even get out of bed to use the bathroom or to eat etc. Maybe their body gets used to it. It’s a lifesaver for steroid Anxiety. Very strong medication!",Theresa
4,Quetiapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,4.0,,"August 17, 2021",0,"I am certain seroquel messed up my thyroid and my medical doctor put me on thyroid medication cause of it. There's another pill to take not to mention a mood stabilizer.Seroquel does help with organizing thoughts or clarity. However another bad thing of seroquel is 300 MG is the psych effects manic effect. A low dose of seroquel is for sleep not mania. SO I am on 300 MG a high dose that vegetates, dulls and slows me down way too much. Age 34 I am a hermit because seroquelit also has side effects. My heart beats slow, my pulse stops. it feels like my pulse it slow. I feel I can't work on seroquel because I wake up 3:00 4:00 in the afternoon because it makes me sleep 10 hours. I can't wake up in the morning because I am in such deep sleep.When I wake up it takes me so long to get ready. I can't get off seroquel because when I do stay up playing the guitar, obsessing on things or just don't go to sleep. It is good for sleep but I do feel seroquel messed up my thyroid.",Anonymous

9,Quetiapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 11, 2020",11,"Seroquel was initially given to me because my doctor suspected I was bipolar. I ended up not being bipolar, but I was definitely psychotic. I was hearing things that weren’t real. I thought that God was communicating with me , but That obviously was not the case. My doctor prescribed me Seroquel and about  10-14 days later I was feeling like my normal self again. My starting dose was 50 mg and increased to 100-200 mg, then 300-400mg. The only complaints I have about this medication is the weight gain & extremely dry mouth. It makes you extremely hungry. I had just lost about 35 pounds prior to starting these meds, I was 195 & now I’m 240 and every week no matter what I do my weight continues to climb higher.

That's the first time I contacted the VA or even heard of PTSD.  One severe symptom was inability to sleep.  VA was very slow to give me an appointment so I went to a private shrink who got me on Seroquel.  VA has kept me on it since.  Taking this, I have been able to get a good night's sleep every night since.  Since then and to this date, if I forget to take it, I either can't fall asleep at all or doze off for about 45 min, then wake up wide awake, and can't get back to sleep .  The FDA hasn't approved this for PTSD sleep disorders, but should do so immediately.  I've had no side effects whatsoever, unlike many other medicines I've been on/off for PTSD.",LZ Bronco

That first night, I slept a full night for the first time in months.  But then I started sleeping too much - up to 14 hrs a day on the weekends.  We backed off to 12.5 mg & my life CHANGED.  I'm under more stress right now so my dose is back to 25 mg & I'm doing great on it.  It pulls me down out of that watchfulness that prevents me from doing anything but surviving (and poorly, at that).  For me, after a near-lifetime of struggle, this is a miracle.",DylanS
