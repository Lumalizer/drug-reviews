2,Prazosin,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 19, 2021",0,"I've been put on minipress to help with PTSD symptoms because of the dangers of addiction with klonopin. This drug had made me relive trauma in greater detail than ever before.  I'm on month three on this medication and I really wanna just stop. It helps me fall asleep but I wake up in a cold sweat after having dreams that seem to combine all my worst traumatic experiences into one night.  Unless this is some type of exposure therapy, then this is just torture and isn't helping with PTSD or anxiety.  My heart is racing right now.  I wouldn't recommend this personally and will be scheduling an appointment with my psychiatrist as soon as possible to insist the dangers of this medication are far worse than becoming dependent on the relief the klonopin gave me. I was only on 1mg of minipress. Nope I don't want to increase and see if it works better.",Ben86
3,Prazosin,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2021",1,"Been taking this medicine for PTSD 1mg at night. After just a few days I started having severe memory problems. They were so bad, I thought I was showing early signs of dementia and also my hands started having tremors. I stopped taking the medication and my memory and shakes are almost non existent. It may take a little while longer as I just stopped 2 days ago. This is just my experience and it may be different for other users of this medication but I would not recommend based of my experience. Also if taking make sure you stand up slowly as I nearly passed out and fell and hurt my shoulder.",Jason

I still dream, but not the terror filled nightmares from before.  I also feel like my anxiety has greatly decreased during the day.  I was able to discontinue my other anxiety medication and just use the Prazosin.  Great medication so far.",Hankster
5,Prazosin,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 5, 2021",3,"I was prescribed prazosin for PTSD induced anxiety, insomnia, and nightmares (daily dose: 4 mg).  It completely took care of my symptoms.  But I developed cardiac symptoms (dangerously low heart rate and irregular heart beat) that remained after I stopped prazosin and that are still an issue that requires medical supervision years later.  Also, when I discontinued prazosin (using the recommended gradual protocol), I experienced horrible withdrawal symptoms (sky high anxiety, severe daily panic attacks, intense insomnia and nightmare rebound) that lasted for three weeks.  Because of my heart symptoms, it was not safe to use alternate medications to ease my symptoms during that period.  I went through hell.  Bottom line: using prazosin to treat PTSD is a new trend (it's conventionally used to treat high blood pressure) and it has risks for people with healthy hearts which are still mostly unknown.  As I learned at my cost, anxiety is awful, but those risks are not worth it.",Anonymous

7,Prazosin,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 10, 2021",0,"I was hit by an SUV while running. Due to brain trauma I couldn’t sleep more than a couple of hours, I did not go into REM sleep. I take it at night. It is magical. I never take any drugs .. they knew that and highly recommended I try for a week. I slept 8 hours.. every nite. Do not take it during the day. It is not something you take for anxiety specifically. What it does is allow your brain to rest at night, creating a healing for trauma. It will make you lightheaded at first if you stand up to fast out of bed… but that will subside after a week. It does not make you groggy, not a sleep aide, it just puts you into deep sleep once you are. I do have PTSD and it helps by giving me rest… it is not a mood enhancing drug.

8,Prazosin,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,,"March 11, 2021",8,"I’ve had PTSD since 9/11. I’d wake several times a night in a jump scare state, or as soon as I’d begin to relax my mind would wander back to that day and my heart would be racing. It was hard trying some sleep tablets, Valium, even Ambien which puts everyone to sleep! Years of night terrors went on until I couldn’t even work anymore. My psychiatrist suggested minipress it was a wonder drug! In hindsight I now feel the name brand minipress was a bit too heavy for me in the daytime or maybe I should’ve taken a lower dosage But when my pharmacy told me that TEVA began manufacturing a generic under the name prazosin its amazing it’s changed my life. I’m still able to think and function without feeling weak & sad I can sleep at night & I had even begun having pleasant dreams. Only now my insurance won’t cover it and I’ve been forced to get the Mylan brand.

14,Prazosin,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 30, 2020",24,"I have PTSD from childhood trauma. I have had nightmares for decades. Not every night, but often enough that I would put off going to sleep until I passed out from exhaustion. The sleep deprivation was taking its toll, and I could barely function. I don’t remember where or how I heard about prazosin, but I asked my doctor about it and she put me on 2mg. I still was in a total rut about staying up late because I was afraid to go to sleep, so she prescribed trazadone too. I noticed the first couple nights that the dreams weren’t as bad, but I was still having them so my dr bumped me up to 4mg. That worked very well for about a year. Now I’m at 5mg and doing well. Maybe one nightmare a month. No side effects at all. I can’t say what a change this has made in my life, to get quality sleep for the first time in so many years.",Shana

I realized that I absolutely cannot go off it because it’s like night & day. I currently take 5 mg at night, I had to slowly increase it 1 mg at a time until I got up to where I am now. That’s the only thing about it, if you go more than two days without it, you have to titrate back up again. I’ve noticed a tremendous difference on this medication. I’m more relaxed during the day, I don’t clench my teeth all the time, I’m less jumpy, the intrusive thoughts have decreased considerably, I sleep better, the paranoia is decreased as are the crazy thought patterns I got myself into from the constant hypervigilance.

During the first week, I noticed that my nightmares seemed much less severe. By the middle of my second week, the dreams were more like strangely vivid weird dreams.  At the tail end of the first 30 days, I felt like my nightmares had stopped.  Physically, I dealt with some dizziness, like for the first 15 minutes. Most of the next two months, I slept pretty good--or so I thought. One morning my husband confronted me about hitting and kicking him in my sleep. That increased over the course of a couple of weeks.   My clinician is slowly increasing of Prazosin over the course of the next month--from 1mg to 4mg.  I have been taking 2mg for the past three nights and feel amazing.  My sleep is much closer to MY normal.  For me, normal is 5 to 6 hours.

I was dreaming but I was actually doing what I was dreaming in real life. I didn't realize this in tell about 3am in the morning when I woke up handcuffed to a stretcher in my local ED.

Have tried for years to convince MD's and shrinks that problem was physiological, e.g. something starts an adreneline rush, fight or flight kicks in and then it won't quit. Thus, I am in constant, 24/7 state of high anxiety. Finally my doctor told me about prazosin - said, try it, it can't hurt. First day, extreme sadness and depression. After that, startle response, adreneline and fight/flight and chronic panic-GONE- almost like magic. Too high a dose and they act like ""happy pills""; not enough adreneline to motivate me to do basic chores, etc. Found the right amount--2 mg at bed each night, and I have a life. Wow.",kiva49

It has been a few months now and I've only gone up one more mg so it is still working great. For me though, the great benefit was that it got rid of all of my dreams not just nightmares and for me that was a big relief.",Anonymous
