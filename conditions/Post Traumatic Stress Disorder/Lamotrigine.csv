0,Lamotrigine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 6, 2022",1,"All my life I have been mentally unstable due to misdiagnosis. I am now diagnosed by a psychiatrist rather than the Drs who kept telling me it was only anxiety with Complex Post Traumatic Disorder. I have now been taking the lamotrigine for just over a year. I am stable for the first time in my life, I cannot express what this means to me at 52 years when all my life I have been governed by my mental health, I used to keep going back to the Drs - hundreds of times since the age of 19 years. I keep thinking if I had one Dr who followed all of my complaints correctly my life would have been worth living and I wouldn't have lost so many jobs and friends. I give Lamotrigine 100%, at least I have the next 20 years to enjoy although not in a youthful state - years I will never get back.",Halfling
1,Lamotrigine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 13, 2022",4,"I have been on Lamotrigine for a month now, titrated up to 100mg. Even with 25mg I could start to notice some effect. I think it was not quite the therapeutic dose and still had my issues related to PTSD like anger, rumination, disassociation. With 100mg it’s really starting to be noticeable. My coping techniques in therapy seem possible for once. Before they felt like a lost cause because if I was fully triggered everything would go out the door. Now I can really reel it in. I have a lot more space in my brain to process my traumas. I’m ok with feeling my emotions because I’m not so disassociated or triggered. It seemed to break my coping via alcohol. I stopped isolating. This really should be considered a first line medication for PTSD. I had to take 8 or 9 different medications to get here. But this one feels like the winner. It’s markedly different than anything I’ve taken. Added benefit: ZERO side effects!",Game Changer
2,Lamotrigine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 18, 2021",2,"I started this medication for possible bipolar/PTSD. I suffered a nerve injury that was very painful, and treated with steroids. The combined pain and steroids obliterated my ability to sleep, even with meds. This went on for months - refractory to ativan, vistaril, lunesta, seroquel, lexapro. I was becoming severely anxious and depressed, and still trying to hold my job on 2 hours of sleep. Eventually I began to break down. I got another psych opinion, and the suggestion was Lamictal. I escalated gradually, starting with peds doses, all the way to 200 mg. I was using 15 mg of Ambien to sleep in the beginning. That dropped to 10mg pretty quickly, then 7.5mg, 5mg, and then 2.5mg in divided doses through the night. By 8 weeks I had my first drug free night of sleep in 8 months. That was about a year and a half ago. I've tapered to 150 mg, and I'm shooting for 100 mg. I'm not sure if what I have is really bipolar or PTSD, but Lamictal gave me my life back.",Innuendo207
3,Lamotrigine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 13, 2021",2,"After multiple antidepressants (and combinations) were unsuccessful in shutting down  chronic flashbacks and intrusive thoughts, lamotrigine has been a game-changer. Still some intrusive thoughts, but they are manageable now. Flashbacks have stopped, almost completely. I have my brain back, and feel like I can now rebuild my life.",KOS

And now they are putting up my meds yet again, it’s starting to feel like they purposely trying to give me Steven Johnson’s syndrome. And boy oh boy, if I do get it and I’ve got it for life, I’m going after my prescriber. Apart from that, I feel the meds are doing their job, but only at 50mg at night and 50mg in morning.",Von Ellesmere
5,Lamotrigine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 11, 2021",3,"This had had life changing effect  and I couldn't describe it any other way. I had to come on here and to make a review. Before taking this I was scared to leave my house, scared of people, dealing with all sorts of issues. Would have panic attacks daily, silent scream in the shower to get all the emotions out, my body was in chronic pain from all of the anger and big feelings. I'm just telling you this to describe HOW BAD it was. 25mg of lamotrgine and I feel like a normal human being. I no longer have to worry about what I will wake up like. If I'll be in a bad mood or a good mood. I'm just .... stable. For the first time in my life. My muscle pain melted away, I can stand up straight, I've maybe had one mild panic attack in 2 weeks (and that was because of external stress issues), only side effect was some diarrhea and insomnia which is going away. Before, I had so much anger in me that I could see people being extra cautious around me. Now, people are responding to me differently. I am a happier person now.",Brittney
6,Lamotrigine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 16, 2021",6,"(I have PTSD from multiple sexual assaults) I had been taking Lexapro and bupropion for depression/anxiety for the past 7-8 years. My new psychiatrist suggested stopping these and being put on lamotrigine to help with my depressive cycles and panic attacks and just to stabilize my mood and trauma responses. I went up gradually, from 25mg to 50mg to 100mg, and just started 150mg. I had a panic attack and self-harm incident after starting this medication, but overall I am not as triggered by things and my response time to hard situations has gone down to 6 mins to an hour or two compared to taking me out for days at a time. I was really reluctant at first since this was a mood stabilizer, but it's the only thing that's worked for my PTSD.",A.B.A.
7,Lamotrigine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,,"March 6, 2021",12,"I've been taking Lamictal for two months to stabilize my moods, for OCD and PTSD.  I started at 25mg and increased every two weeks to 100mg.  Four hours after taking my first dose, I itched (no rash) so I took a Benadryl.  The itching left and never returned.  I was sleepy the first week so I took Lamotrigine at bedtime.  After the first week, I switched back to mornings.  A few days after my first dose I felt calm, not moody.  After a week at each dose I felt the need to increase because I could feel my moodiness returning.  I am throwing out things that remind me of traumatic events.  I'll need to increase past 100mg to get more relief from my depression.  No sexual side effects; no rash; no effect on my menstrual cycle; mild nausea that doesn't last all day; mild decrease in appetite; have lost a few pounds; thoughts that trigger my OCD are still there but but I can see when I am about to engage in an OCD ritual; rage is better; no explosive outbursts in several weeks.",OCD
8,Lamotrigine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 19, 2021",8,"I have cptsd with some bipolar2 symptoms but not too strong. I've just reached 100mg of lamotrigine & after a wk was amazed with results. I feel calmer, but not numb. I actually feel like I'm not taking any chemicals. Only downfall is its increased insomnia & not needing to sleep as long. However no other side effects. Dr is happy for me to remain at this dosage as long as it keeps working. I've tried Seroquel, lithium, sodium valporate cipramil & this is 100% compared to other meds that gave side effects. I'm thrilled. Doesn't mess with libido or weight gain/loss absolutely nothing for me. Definitely right med for me. Highly recommend for PTSD. Way better than an antidepressant by far",Donna

11,Lamotrigine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,,"April 30, 2020",75,"I have been taking Lamotrigine for over 6 months. I am now at 150 mg. At 100mg or less if was a bit sedating so I took it at night. After reaching 150mg, I got some pretty bad insomnia so I take it in the mornings now. May need a sleeping pill because benzos aren't helping the insomnia.Before taking lamictal, I've been on over 20 medications for PTSD. Every single one made symptoms of anger, PTSD, depersonalization, and bipolar much worse. With Lamictal, it just doesn't do that. It helps instead of hurts. I used to be too afraid to leave my room to pee. Now I went to a job interview yesterday. I spent 2 years not leaving my house, not eating, not living. I was ready to give up on ever healing. Lamictal hasn't fixed everything for me. No medication can do that. It takes a lot of trial and error, a whole lot of self work, but without Lamictal I don't think I would have even started making changes in my life.",Beemzo

I have bipolar, severe derealization and depersonalization from PTSD. I can tell that things (physical things) are becoming more real. Items are slowly more 3D rather than 2D. My brain has removed the part of reality that allows me to feel a part of life as a coping mechanism for my safety. Whatever this drug is doing I am grateful for it because I believe before this my life was a nightmare. Not being able to connect that reality is physically real. I can feel it quieting my intrusive ruminating thoughts which is amazing. In the shower the other day I heard, for the first time, quiet except for the water running and I broke down crying because I never realized how truly loud my thoughts were. I still have a ways to go but I do also feel it evening out my moods. I'm not as angry and easily triggered.",Lavacy20

As you can imagine I've already tried numerous drugs with mostly pretty bad side effects and no benefits at all. So I was really hopeful that this time it would be different, also because it apparently helped so many others with various conditions. But again I was disappointed. I started with 25mg lamotrigine and went up to 300mg and still it did nothing. In the beginning I didn't have any side effects either. Lately I have nausea, headaches, dizziness, muscle pain and another weird thing always when I close my eyes I see bright colors. But I think all these things are rather because of my ongoing deteriorating health situation than because of this drug. I wish you more luck!",naibaf

I’m on week 2 at 50 mg and I feel much calmer.  My anxiety is a bit higher and I tend to overthink about small situations, my vision is a bit more blurry (which sucks cuz I’m already blind as a bat lol!) and my balance and coordination is off.But overall I’m in a better mood, no panic attacks, no flashbacks or negative feelings. I’m much more patient with my kids and I actually want to do more with them now than I have before.  I recommend this medication to others to try for PTSD or any other reason they have it available for.    I can’t wait to see how I feel on 100 mg and once these side effects calm down, if they ever do.   In the end the side effects are worth the outcome of the medication",Bubbles
16,Lamotrigine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,5.0,,"July 29, 2019",25,"Lamotrigine immediately took away my hypervigilance and ruminations at the smallest dose of 25mg. Unfortunately many psychiatrists are not willing to maintain such a small dose as it is technically a pediatric dose; not therapeutic for adults. As my dose was titrated up, the side effects began. At 50mg my vision became blurry, my passion for life stunted, with a constant runny nose and sore throat. At 75mg I experienced severe depression, cycling through mania. It felt as if my body was in autopilot, and I was along for the ride. It was as if I was merely observing my instability and could not control it even if I tried. I went back down to 50mg and have been on it for 2 months. My hypervigilance is still under control but this is because my constant emotional arousal has been replaced by soul shattering apathy. This medication is very effective, just not for me due to the side effects.",Sara

I have past traumas and ask if he thought I had PTSD. He disregard what I said and said I have a lot of anxiety and put me on anti anxiety meds. I have been on every med for past twenty five years and suffered through it all. I was taking lithium, seroquel and an anti depressant for past ten years until the doctor finally suggest lamictal. I have taken 25mg for about 2 weeks and feel great no more racing thoughts, I can make decision, don't feel confused and can remember things.

As it turns out, I was supposed to be taking 300 mg per day and I was only taking 100 mg. My wife sets up my meds since she tosses a lot of vitimans in along with my other meds: Lexapro, Klonopin, etc. so I never checked. I finally looked at the bottle and holy cow I wasn't taking enough. So, I went back up to 300 mg and what a difference. My only side effects and yawning and sleepiness but a couple of cups of coffee knocks out. Finally, I can sleep and can get some things done around the place instead of sitting about staring at the four walls. Thus, I would give this med a high recommendation. Granted, not everyone, can handle this med without some awful reactions but I've always tolerated meds quite well. So, choose you poison carefully. ;)",Gwaredd Thomas
21,Lamotrigine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,,"December 21, 2018",44,"Depending on the doctor, I have PTSD, delusional disorder, bi-polar, depression, anxiety, OCD. This drug brightens my outlook immensely. It gives me energy and stops food cravings. I have experienced no side effects at all. I took it for about a year (10 months at 200mg). I got jaded, because I still felt like I was not 100% cured. I tried some other drugs and quit lamotrigine, being leery of long term toxicity of drugs in general. After a year, I got to such a depressive state that I tried it again. I've been on it for one week at 50mg, and it's like magic. Not only is it having all the same positive effects as before, it took away chronic leg pain that I had for several months due to muscle pulls that never healed right. Unbelievable!

After getting in to the doctor he immediately confirmed what my primary care suspected  - I had PTSD.  He discussed using Lamotigine and steadily increasing the dose over the next year to reduce the anger, anxiety and hopelessness that had come over me.

I have noticed Lamotrigine helped tremendously with my symptoms of hypervigilance, which are much less severe today.It also helps me with depressive episodes. I rarely fall into depressive states where I can not function, and when I do, they are much shorter than they used to last.Sadly I haven't seen any improvement in avoidance symptoms, but I didn't expect it to help this symptom of PTSD in the first place.It might also be important to note that I don't have a history of manic symptoms.",R.

My mental health was already not great before my assault two years ago, and ever since then I've felt like all of my hard work up to that point had been erased. Since then, I've cycled through pretty much every SSRI available and have never felt a noticeably positive difference. Thankfully, my doctor was more than open to my idea to switch to a mood stabilizer and prescribed Lamictal. Before this I felt like I was constantly reliving my trauma, and that mostly manifested as extreme anger and irritation largely directed at those closest to me. I still get irritated and overemotional sometimes, but it is not nearly as devastating. I'm hoping future dosage increases will help even more.",orangetoday

About 6 yrs ago after a very traumatic experience with losing my boys and husband nothing worked anymore, I started having stress induced seizures, some very serious! They put me on Lamictal and my periods of mania and mind racing slowly stopped, my restless legs syndrome went away. I actually started to feel and not be a robot. Side effects for me are drowsiness and slight weight gain (8 lbs), I'd gain any amount to feel normal. One VERY important fact to remember is dosage! Everyone has different amounts that work, and don't ever skip or adjust dosage on your own! I did it and paid the price. Hope this helps! I feel grateful to my doc for prescribing.",kimmur
