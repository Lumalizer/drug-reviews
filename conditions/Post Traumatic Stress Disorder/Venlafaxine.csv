0,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,1.0,,"December 21, 2021",1,"I never have given up so soon on a drug than I did with this one. I felt so unwell. My whole body felt so unwell. From sickness to dry mouth, constipation, tingling head and side of my face to convulsions at night in bed and restless legs. I had no emotion just numb. As soon as I stopped the medication I felt human again. Never and I've been on 5 different medications including citalopram which I was on for 10 years and the side affects at first I remember were bad enough but I stuck to it. Venlaflaxine was a whole new level of torture. Yes that's what it felt like. Never would I advise this to anyone.",Anonymous
1,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 26, 2021",1,"After suffering with PTSD for well over 20 years in varying intensity of symptoms, and after trying most of the SSRI medications. I have to say that this medication has helped me with managing symptoms to a point I am able to live again without overwhelming panic attacks and anxiety. Whilst flashbacks and sleep disturbances are still present, the after effects of panic and anxiety associated with it are far less intense, at least that is how it feels. I am so happy to have found this medication. Side effects were initially present for a few weeks including dry mouth and foggy headed and I was a little nauseated, however all I am left with now is a dry mouth. Not much to complain about in the big picture of things as the alternative to not taking them is far worse. I understand coming off the medication can be challenging with symptoms if not managed properly , however, due to the effect venlafaxine has had on me I hope to remain on them for as long as I can.",Nigel
2,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 5, 2021",3,"Do NOT take this unless you plan to stay on it forever. Admit I am sensitive to meds but started on this for mainly anxiety and mild panic attacks with mild depression when laid off during covid. I WAS TOLD it was hard to get off but I am a pharmacist-thought I could handle it. It worked fine for 6 months then no longer needed or seemed to do anything. Got compound pharmacy to make up liquid to taper just few mg every few weeks-took 4 months. TWO MONTHS after NO meds: still horrific brain/body zaps 1-2 times a week, have tried EVERY remedy-nothing stops zaps. I am a dancer and can barely walk on these days: zaps keep me lying down all day. It is HORRID. DO NOT USE unless you plan to stay on it FOREVER.",Donottake
3,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,,"April 22, 2021",8,"I have been on Effexor ER for three years now for anxiety and PTSD, and it truly saved my life. I have hand anxiety and depression since I opened by eyes. I got very good at managing my problem until I had a hysterectomy after a cancer diagnosis. I can honestly say I would have ended my life if this hadn’t worked so well for me. I have genuinely way less anxiety but only on lower doses. On higher ones I start to have bad side effects. Pros: I feel stable and happy for the first time ever. I don’t have social anxiety to the point where I won’t leave my house anymore. I don’t have terrible nightmares. I lost 40 lbs while on it as my appetite is low.Cons: withdrawal is terrible. Take your doses or you will FEEL it. My libido has suffered. I also tend to have trouble reaching orgasm. I take an herbal supplement called in the mood that helps me with that (I am female) I have been on almost every med known to woman in my 39 years. This one worked well for me.",Simplykenji

5,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,,"December 20, 2020",0,"I was prescribed the drug and at first, it seemed to work. Felt like a dream when I came home like it wasn't real. Then, reality set in. I started having flashbacks of the last trauma I endured and it kept going backwards showing me all the horrible stuff I went through as a child, everywhere I looked, that's what I saw. I couldn't stand to be home, I was terrified for my life, I couldn't stop crying for a whole week, I couldn't even work, eat, or sleep. I'm scared to take antidepressants now. Like it really messed with my head. I didn't take it anymore after my best friend told me to stop taking it.",Sophia Hart

7,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,,"May 21, 2020",32,"This drug has literally saved my life. I agree with others that the initial side effects can be bad, so sleepy for the first week but switched to taking it at night. I take the slow release after dinner (better tolerated with food) helped me sleep which helped me to feel a little better initially. The dose to start was 37.5mg for 3 weeks then up to 75mg. so sweaty!!! If I don't take with food I get horrible nausea. sex drive decreased slightly initially, and weight gain of about 5kgs. Now I've been on it for about 6 months. Slowly losing the weigh, sleeping great, no suicidal thoughts/ideation or maybe just a couple fleeting thoughts, decrease in obsessive thoughts, no nightmares, decrease in impulsive behaviours, disassociation, emotional regulation!! Highs and lows kind of dulled I would say. experiencing the grey areas for the first time in 20 years. Feeling ""normal"" increase in interest in social activities. Honestly  this is the best antidepressant  I've ever had. I will never stop taking it!!",c
8,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 6, 2019",18,"I started Venlafaxine 37 mg about 3 months ago. I am having a great experience with my medicine. I have PTSD and anxiety. I have suffered from Sleep Hallucinations since age 14. I would have the hallucinations about 3 to 5 times per week at times. The side effects with this medicine isn’t bad at all for me.  I take my medicine around 8pm and get drowsy about 1 your later but that’s ok because I go to sleep around 930pm. No headaches or stomach issues with it. I would keep an open mind with trying this drug and give it a few weeks to get through any initial side effects. Since this medicine, I have not had any sleep hallucinations and I feel great. My anxiety all went away and I feel like I am living my Best Life!!!",Kel
9,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 25, 2019",11,"I have been on this medication for about a month now. At first it seemed to work, flying bright eyed and alert. Then after a few days I have been experiencing migraines, explosive diarrhea, high blood pressure, anger, irritability, insomnia, and just mental disconnected fog feeling.My PTSD, Manic episodes have increased from the I believe is the side effects",Ed
10,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 22, 2019",14,"I have been on 75 mg of Venlafaxine for two years now for PTSD, anxiety, depression and chronic hot flashes. Additionally,  I live with a family member with high-functioning autism. My doctor was frank, the symptoms for your body and brain to get used to the drug can be pretty terrible.  I had heart palpitations, couldn't sleep, felt sick and experienced brain fog.  It lasted about two weeks.  After that, I started to feel good.  I have been able to sleep better because of the reduction of hot flashes, and am better able to manage my days.  It's not a cure-all.  I still see a psychologist regularly and have to allow plenty of quiet time to recover from social activities, but this is the best I've been in years.",Mrs. Moose
11,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 14, 2019",25,venlafaxine probably saved my life after a decade of trying to beat it myself.

12,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,6.0,,"July 21, 2019",26,"I have been taking Venlafaxine  to treat complex post traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety and episodes of clinical depression. It worked for me quite well but the side effects of meds were horrid and did not go away without weeks as promised. Vivid dreams, hot flushes, decreased libido, just to name a few. I felt numb. It was the main reason for me to try and come off it. Try is a good word. Took me 3 attempts in total. If someone told me a year ago coming off it would be so difficult I would never consider putting those drugs in my body. I genuinely believed I was about to die last night! Electric shocks/ waves going through  my brain, fewling hot/ cold, chest pains, uncontrollable crying with flashbacks, horrible vertigo- fell down the stairs this morning! My life is a misery at the moment. Please do some research before you start the treatment. Coming off this drug can be very frightening...",Julie

15,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,,"September 8, 2017",18,"Best antidepressant I've tried. On 225mg, also on 5mg Olanzapine for BPD (helps with mood & anxiety). Best combo I've had to date, but doesn't make me energetic, but alleviates the C-PTSD, BPD and IBS, so it's a winner.",Richstad
16,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,,"July 29, 2017",27,"Nearly all of my life, now retired, in spite of being a high achiever, confident (on the surface) and skilled, I have fought against depression, anxiety, self harm, a lack of connection. I have hidden it well, feeling ashamed of not being happy inside. Tired of the fight I finally saw my doctor and tried several different tricyclics, SRIs, but all gave me unwelcome symptoms. We agreed to try Venlafaxine, and within a fortnight I was feeling so much better. I then started CBT, was diagnosed with delayed trauma, which surprised me but as we worked through it, made sense.  My drug dose was doubled and I'm feeling even better. I am so relieved. This drug works for me, no side effects, and I feel so much calmer and able to cope.",Nevertoolate
17,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,,"April 19, 2017",18,"Been on Venlafaxine for 3 months now. I suffer from complex PTSD and BPD. Love it so far! Much more effective than SSRIs. Started on 75mg a day, taking 2 tablets. Felt better regards to my anxiety in just a few days. Side effects were insomnia to begin with, shaky hands, random sweats and constipation oh and of course lack of libido (I now take viagra as needed).My doctor then changed my dose to 150mg extended release, this is much better regards to side effects no more sweating or shakey hands and can sleep much better. So yeah the side effects are horrible to begin with but stick with it! I have yet to miss a dose but I've heard it's pretty hell so I try to take my medication everywhere I go. Overall great medication!",Joespillers
18,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 16, 2017",17,"Venlafaxine ER gives me a bigger bucket to hold my anxiety and depression so I don't launch into panic attacks or deep depressive episodes quite as quickly. Because it does not take away any feelings or emotions, it still allows my mind to learn to deal with my stressors and triggers. And, it does not take my mind from me at all, which is eminently important to me because I am a detail-oriented thinker by nature.",GlenH
19,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,3.0,,"February 22, 2017",11,"The medication did not treat my symptoms that were unique to PTSD, namely nightmares/re-experiencing.  I was on a high dose of this drug, 300 mg/day, and then went higher and combined it with lamictal as a mood stabilizer. It unfortunately increased the moments of panic, and made me feel out of control when making decisions in a stressed environment, which is unfortunately the opposite of what I would expect a PTSD medication to do. I made worse decisions on this drug than without it, and felt panicked and stressed more often.",Jo M.
20,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,,"November 22, 2016",18,"I was diagnosed with delayed onset, chronic PTSD.  Symptoms were severe.  This medication has helped me more than just SSRIs.   I'm on he lowest dose, and I feeel better than I have in a long time.",45Ptsd

I am stronger, enjoy life and I actually have a better sex life cuz I'm in a better mood and can feel emotionally what I need to. For the women out there: I tried to push past the numbness and I can now can achieve full multiple orgasms. There's away if you are determined enough.

22,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,1.0,,"August 31, 2016",13,"This drug was prescribed after several attempts on my life in a short period. I was prescribed 75mg for 2 weeks, then 150mg for 4 weeks and finally 300mg for 2 1/2 years. (Daily dosages)Within the first two weeks I could no longer ""climax"", I began getting paranoid and went from mild social phobia to debilitating agoraphobia. I became distant from my wife and kids and regular attempts on my life had me in and out of hospital during the entire time on this drug. I tried to withdraw myself as my doctor was reluctant to assist and tried to assure me it was better than not taking it. The withdrawals where like someone letting off fire crackers in my skull, within 72 hours it even effected my vision pulsing white light with every ""spark"". AVOID",Socialphobicsocialite
23,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 24, 2016",7,"I can't really say anything about how effective it is because it worsened ALL of my symptoms. Despression, considerably worse. Urge for Amphetemines, Alcohol and Cocaine (as well as valium on one occasion) were severly worsened and I havent touched any of those drugs (except alcohol) in nearly 20 years. Suicidal thought weren't even present until I took this medication and I was on the lowest dose available. All Symptomes of Restless Limb Syndrome were severly worsened. Derealisation was worsened to the point of depersonalisation. Anxiety was drastic to the point that I wanted Amphetemines against the Down AND Valium/Xanax against the anxiety. Urge for strong drugs and RLS symptomes were only tolerable after microdosing cannabis.",wiseguy77192
24,Venlafaxine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 1, 2016",15,"Effexor XR is the best thing that's happened to me since my life went to hell in a hand basket a few months back. It dragged me back from the edge. And I was lucky, I started improving at the 2 week mark. Most people take up to a month to notice a difference. (Although those 2 weeks waiting were horrible, especially since I didn't know if it would do anything). What it's helped with: severe depression, severe anxiety, panic attacks, and that heightened startle reflex. Side effects I experience on 75mg: night sweats, occasional shakes (these have gotten less over time), and occasional nausea (again, less over time). There have also been some seriously vivid dreams/nightmares, but I've also got PTSD. *shrugs* Could easily be either.",ARaine14
