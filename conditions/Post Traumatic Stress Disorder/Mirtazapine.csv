0,Mirtazapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 21, 2022",6,"I started taking Mirtazapine after I was suffering from PTSD and waiting for CBT. I wasn't sleeping and my intrusive thoughts and flashbacks meant I couldn't do basic tasks. After the initial 2 weeks getting over the side effects (headaches, sleepiness) I was back at work, sleeping and functioning normally. They were an absolute lifesaver. I did feel a bit hungrier at first but that has gone away now. My experience has been very positive. I'm from the UK so I can't help with insurance experience.",Lac123
1,Mirtazapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 18, 2022",4,"I suffered near 30 years of having nightmares & night terrors. Violent abuse and sexual abuse led to addiction. I came off illicit substances 17 years ago but from then onwards I lived with Dystonia, severe depression and FND. I became so used to living this way , that it became ME. I tried Sertraline initially and stayed on it for over 2 years thinking that was the only option. This caused motor agitation, made my neurological symptoms more intense and painful .. 5 weeks ago I asked my doctor if I could take Mirtazapine. I started on 15mg . Immediately I slept better , I felt calmer most of the day but my panic and despair would kick in around 3/4pm . I started taking 30mg . The sedative effects and mild side effects were gone and gradually the bad feelings were replaced with contentment and hope . I could go out , make phone calls , I wanted to write and draw ... I even resolved things with my partner after a 2 month break. I realised he had suffered alongside me.",Bella

3,Mirtazapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 23, 2021",4,"After several months on a combo of lexapro and gabapentin that made me so sick, my doc switched me to 15 mg of mirtazapine and I am so thankful! I DID experience suicidal thoughts and insane hunger at the beginning but those diminished and now I look forward to sleeping! As someone who was in clinical trials, psychotherapy, and various meds for years to try to combat my PTSD nightmares, mirtazapine was the drug I was waiting for! I still have dreams but no longer have the emotional and physical terror in them that had become my normal. I have a beta blocker to help with breakthrough anxiety since this drug didn’t quell my daytime anxiety, but I’m so thankful my nights are no longer owned by my trauma. I also have a comorbid eating disorder and mirtazapine restored my body’s hunger cues that I haven’t had since I was small. I am so grateful for this drug!",Ptsdthriver
4,Mirtazapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 1, 2021",2,"(note: I also take Propranalol 40mg 3 x a day for anxiety since 2019)I was first prescribed August 2020, 30mg. Immediate effects: sedation, nausea, muscle twitching. Slept 10-13 hours every night for ~ week. Levelled out to 9-10 hours a night.First 8 months or so: dulled very intense anxiety & hypervigilance, alleviated crushing low mood, allowed me to get through trauma therapy.In early October 2021, started 45mg as no longer sleeping well, feeling noticeably anxious/manic with possible psychosis.Initially, 45mg induced 10-12 hour sleep but approaching 1 month, effects wearing off. Side effects: twitching and tremor in legs before sleep, intense hunger, heightened anxiety + elevated mood, racing thoughts, difficulty focusing. Somewhat heightened impulsive behaviour means I am seeking new experiences but could be risky.IMO, most effective with short term use e.g. less than a year but now I dread weaning off, imagine side effects will be rough.",derajaib

I was started on 15mg mirtazapine, after 4-6 weeks I still felt awful so increased to 30mg, same thing so increased to 45mg. The adjustment period was rougher than other antidepressants I've been on. On 45mg my mood is totally stable. I don't feel anxious which is amazing. A lot of my symptoms have been reduced. I still experience triggers, but I'm not sure any pill would remove that. I can function again, nothing but good things to say about mirtazapine! ​I was so anxious prior that I couldn't eat, mirtazapine completely changed that, has really helped my body image. I've tried SO many SSRI's + the side effects were terrible, with mirtazapine I can still cry which is really important for me, I have no sexual disfunction. If you're struggling to adjust please keep going! When I was adjusting I'd come here + read good reviews to get me through. Worth it x",Bbb10000

14,Mirtazapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,,"December 24, 2020",12,"Trigger warning - bad experiences in life aheadI’ve been on mirtazapine for about a year now and I can say it’s certainly helped.I have been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, depression and generalised anxiety. At the most, mirtazapine has helped me feel calm and more stable as well as helping me sleep at night. Even though it helps you sleep it can can be a real pain with getting up in the morning but to me the pro’s outweigh the cons. I had put on a bit of weight whilst being on mirtazapine but being stable is completely worth it. I started on 15mg and had a couple of traumatic things happen in my life which lead the doctor to higher my dosage to 30mg which is working wonderfully. It’s a massive help to assist me in coping with everyday life but drugs affect everyone differently. It’s definitely worth a go but please remember things may get a tad worse over the 2-4 week period of when you first start taking it.",Do little

Am by no means a fan of tablets, but for me this one has helped me focus on me more than any other.

18,Mirtazapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,,"April 13, 2020",34,"I've been on mirtazipine 30mg for 5 months now and it's definitely the only medication I've tried that seems to be effective.  I have complex post traumatic stress disorder and it has helped me quite a lot with that.  My anxiety has been reduced significantly and I no longer feel depressed.  At the beginning, I did have difficulty waking up in the morning and staying awake due to the grogginess I felt but now, I don't have this problem at all and I even find myself waking up at 6-7 in the morning naturally.  The only downside to this medication is the fact that it'll make you so, so hungry to the point that it can become quite painful.  All you want to eat is chocolate, sweets, ice cream, biscuits and etc and the cravings are quite difficult to deal with.  This does gradually decrease over time and it does become easier to manage.  You can definitely combat these side effects if you find them becoming an issue.",Umami al-Boolin

I have tried anti depressants a couple of times over the years but the negatives have out weighed the positives and I've always stopped taking them.  I regularly wake with a feeling anxiousness and mirtazapine has definitely helped my sleep.  I do have some blurry vision with it and do sometimes feel irritable.   I only take half of a 15mg tablet which is enough and reduces side effects.  Overall, it's the best thing I've tried.

I had my first mirtazapine tablet last night and slept like a baby from 2/3 am (when I took it) to 10:30 am NO NIGHTMARES! And no alarms. I did fall back asleep around 2pm until 6pm and I'm very drowsy but it's all mental tiredness. My body feels like I could go for a run.

Started on mirtazapine 15 mg which stopped my tremors, helped me get my appetite back and initially helped me sleep. Because I had additional complications of multiple benign tumours in my womb which were misdiagnosed as a stomach ulcer, I was prescribed lansoprosole and ranitidine together which gave me anorexia. My dose of mirtazapine was upped to 30g to combat the stress of this, but I feel like the other meds made it less effective. In the end, the lowest dose of mirtazapine  7.5g  before bed was the most effective to helped me sleep, reset my body clock, regulated my appetite and generally made me feel better.

The mitrazapine does the same thing without the dope side effects. I'm taking 30mg/night. I should warn you, the adjustment period to this drug was hard, so make sure you are somewhere safe until you feel your mood stabilize, which might take a week. On day 3 of taking this drug my symptoms were worse. On the morning of day 4 I felt like a changed person and haven't had a single thought of suicide/self harm since.

45,Mirtazapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 27, 2015",26,I was taking 15mg Mirtazapine for anxiety and PTSD before bed for two months. At first it helped with the anxiety and nightmares I was having. Within 30 minutes of taking it I was out. It was very difficult to get out of bed in the morning. The morning drowsy side effects only lasted about two weeks for me but then I started having twitches in my eyelids. I had never had a seizure before but have had 3 petit mal seizures since. After my third and extremely violent seizure I stoped use and have not used since. Seizures have also stoped along with the twitching in my face. If you you start to have and twitching in your face or eyelids I recomend consulting your dr. By the time I did it was almost too late. I also experienced memory loss.,Chadwick85

I rarely have the vivid nightmares and generally get about 6 hours of good sleep followed by an hour or two of drowsiness.Before I was on this regimen, I was lucky to have 3 hours of sleep, so I am pretty happy with it.",oldfart2
47,Mirtazapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 9, 2015",23,"I've been on a few different medications, which all made me really drowsy and had little effect with anxiety symptoms, if anything was more paranoid as couldn't function properly, however now on 15mg mirtazapine taken around 8pm before bed, it has worked the best! I'm actually out of bed daily not feeling hopelessness and eased my anxiety ten fold..! I feel alive again.not hyper but normal, for the first time in long time. (10years) only side effect I've found is my appetites increased, but am monitoring it. If I had known that medication worked so well I would of asked for a review years ago.",Anonymous
48,Mirtazapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 30, 2015",28,"Mirtazapine is a great medication. It was my first antidepressant. I would say it's very mild compare to other antidepressants. The only problem was that I was eating too much, waking up at night to eat chocolate and I put on weight a lot! I think that I had restless legs syndrome too. Apart from that I was happy, no sexual dysfunction, great sleep. But after couple months I had panic attacks again. My body got used to it and my doctor increased the dose, even that couldn't help. I was on the highest dose...So I had to change my medication.",Anna1238

When I did get up I was in a surreal state of mind very zombie like, pupils so full, looked like I was high. That was on 1/2 so I tried 1/4. The effects did lessen but I still felt weird.",Darlyn56
51,Mirtazapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 17, 2012",52,I have been taking 45 mg of mirtazapine for about 2 years. I stated taking it after I nearly got killed after a light truck hit me. I find it helps me out so much. All I do is focus on physical rehabilitation. I'm in a wheelchair at the moment but I will one day walk again. Maybe next year or in 10. Patience is a virtue. I stated off on 30 mg but my Doctor increased the dose. She could tell I was getting a bit low and my thoughts were dominating my personality. Of course she made the correct call. I find mirtazapine perfect for me. ,Mr Coolio

54,Mirtazapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,,"November 12, 2011",57,"I have been on mirtazapine for almost 2 months now at 15mg for anxiety and PSTD. I take it before I go to bed because it does make me very drowsy. I get a good nights sleep with some crazy dreams but not anything bad. It has helped my depression well and I don't get as anxious when going certain places. Although, I do take half a pill for certain situations if I have to during the day. My appetite did increase greatly which was a benefit for me. Especially before bed, I can kill some donuts but I have been able to control it better now over some time. All in all it has worked well for me and I recommend it for others with the hope they experience the benefits I have. ",Anonymous
