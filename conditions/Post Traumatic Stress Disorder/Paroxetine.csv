0,Paroxetine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 13, 2021",0,"I started taking Paxil 22 years ago for depression and anxiety. I started on 20 mg per day in the morning. Within 2 weeks I felt like a black curtain had lifted. My dosage was then increased to 30 mg per day about 10 years ago. I was then diagnosed with Complex PTSD. I had daily anxiety, racing thoughts and frightening nightmares and insomnia. My dosage was increased to 40 mg per day about 2 weeks ago. I find that I am calm and no longer have racing thoughts. I am sleeping through the night without nightmares. I have had no side effects",Boopeysmom
1,Paroxetine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2021",1,"Hello everyone who is looking for good review I was looking up reviews and YouTube videos and going crazy for almost 2 months. I was so scared to start the pill even tho I had it 10 years ago for very short time, it has all started back in July when I had my first panic attack after that I start going every other day to ER because my symptoms was physical like chest pain shortness of breath it’s horrible and so scary. I went also to my primary care doctor and had blood work done. I was crying and in a panic every time I visit the doctor because I got so tired not knowing whats going on ! Health wise I found out I'm anemic, ferritin very low at 3 , vitamin D deficiency, and the doctor was sitting me there and telling me I'm fine its all in my head ! Please always check your own blood work . 4 weeks ago I started Paxil low dose and today I'm back to work after being home for 2 months with anxiety and depression, give it a try and wait on the pill to work . Don't give up",It's working
2,Paroxetine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 28, 2021",1,"I have had PTSD since I was 12 following SA. The perpetrator was jailed in 2018 and following the trial I suffered from a relapse of PTSD. During that time I was prescribed Mirtazepine and Venlafaxine which in hindsight I believe only masked my symptoms, ultimately making them worse by 2021. During the whole time I was unable to keep my job as a nurse and my PTSD got so bad I tried to end my life twice ending up in hospital. I researched paroxetine and felt it was worth trying it. I have now been on it for 2 months and I feel better than I have ever felt. It started after a few days and gradually improved over time. I wake up refreshed every morning, thankful to be alive and excited for the day. I am back at the gym most days and have been accepted for a new nursing role which I start next month. Those of you who are at the end of your rope please give it a go. I was pessimistic at the start but now I am 100% certain that, along with therapy and exercise, it has cured me of my PTSD.",Martin
3,Paroxetine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 17, 2021",0,"Of all the SSRI's/SNRI's I've tried (zoloft,effexor,remeron,celexa,lithium) and they all either didn't work or they made me feel different (not in a good way) or I had side effects. I finally tried paxil after avoiding it because of the stigma and ""addiction"" talk. From dose number one I was 70% better at 10 mg. I went to 20 mg after 2 weeks and didn't have any nausea, insomnia or any side effects in the beginning. I felt better and better by the day but it was the only antidepressant that didn't make me feel like I was ""on"" something. It made me feel normal. Started February 2012 on 10 mg and went to 20 mg. I went through a stressful year during the pandemic so I was upped to 30 mg. 9 years and it still is working great for me. It's paxil or nothing for me.",ColdWhiteNorth
4,Paroxetine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 26, 2021",3,"Paxil (paroxetine):So I started taking Paxil after failed attempts at trying other drugs and it has been the best so far so I wanted to share my experience in order to help others.   Paxil helps with avoidance symptoms and intrusive memories unlike other medicines,  it was able to help my anxiety a lot honestly too without giving me the feeling of completely changing who I am as a person.   I am able to enjoy things and am less concerned about going places.   It does tend too make me drowsy for a little when I first wake up and doesn't give me energy (although I'm not as easily tired out).  I feel like this medication with the combination of a daily vitamin is the best I've experienced so far.",Nami
5,Paroxetine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,,"August 1, 2021",1,"The best anti anxiety medication I’ve ever had. It takes several weeks to notice improvement. I start this med on a 1/4 20mg tablet, increasing by a 1/4 after 4 days, and again until reaching 1 and a half tablets (=60mg) If anxiety increases (about a week in) I also have a 2 week course of Clonazepam as a bridging medication. I don’t take anymore clonazepam as is addictive. By then the paroxetine is taming down the anxiety anyway. Eventually at 6 weeks anxiety and panic is easy to manage. By 8 weeks is non existent. After 6 months I ease back little by little to 3/4 of a tablet (=15mg) and stay in that dose. Side effects lower libido and difficulty reaching climax during sex. However I don’t take it the day before sex and the libido and climax return. I make sure I take paroxetine immediately after sex though as helps not to stay off it too long Another side effect is short term memory loss, but that’s welcome because I don’t want to keep worrying over and over.",Sam

I was prescribed Paxil 40mg for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder when I went into a drug recovery treatment center about 2 months ago. Coming into the center I had horrible night terrors/waking up fighting and screaming in my sleep, throughout the day I used to have constant flashbacks and so much anxiety and hopelessness. After 2 months of being on Paxil my anxiety went down tremendously, I barely get night terrors from trauma anymore and I seem to cope much better during the days with my past trauma. Paxil is known to be great for PTSD. The only side effect I had was dilated pupils.",Anonymous

It’s been insanely helpful for depression more than anything in my opinion. It gives me a boost of energy maybe an hour after taking it. I’ve still been on it relatively recently (2 months) but I found it made waking up easier.,Riley

12,Paroxetine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,1.0,,"April 30, 2020",26,Paxil (paroxetine):I was prescribed 12.5 mg of Paxil for PTSD. I have been on it a year. It gave me horrible nightmares and upon awakening I felt so overwhelmed and depressed it was awful. I suffered through this for a year while Drs told me the Paxil would not cause my symptoms. I had never felt this horrible in my life. I finally found a new psychiatrist and told her about my problems with SSRIs. I was put on Trintellix a week ago. Today is the first day in a year that I felt good just waking up in the morning. I hope it lasts. I also am a mental health professional and have some understanding of antidepressants or I would have just given up and believed what the doctors told me about the antidepressants not causing my symptoms.  No one really knows how the psychoactive meds work and they can affect any one person differently than another. So my advice is to believe yourself if you think a med is causing you negative side effects and don't give up until you find what works for you.,Junie
13,Paroxetine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 16, 2019",17,"After years of suffering from anxiety and depression, I finally took my sister's advice to get on medication.  20mg of Paroxetine saved my life and sanity.  Now I am calm, focused, no thoughts of suicide, don't lose my temper anymore, I don't get upset at the slightest thing anymore, I sleep like log, I don't suffer from constipation anymore.  Although I do feel sometimes like I am lazy, the truth is I've always been LAZY.  Depression gave me an excuse to be lazy.  It helps to write out TO DO and gratitude lists. When I fought the idea of being on meds it was because I resented the STIGMA of having to take anti-anxiety meds.  Now I AM RUNNING TO PHARMACY every 30 days to make sure I get my Paroxetine! In one year, this med has completely changed my life for the better. My relationships have changed too.  Feedback from my family and friends is that I have become a happy, well adjusted person, not constantly flying off the handle.  Can't say enough about this medication.",FeelingGood!

16,Paroxetine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 3, 2018",4,"I was prescribed Paroxetine for PTSD, OCD, depression, and anxiety. I took it for 3 months. The only thing it did for me was made me have intense dark thoughts and made me so, so hungry. I had no issues eating before but didn't have an appetite. I don't think I gained any weight but it was ridiculous. I've been off of it for about 2 months and I'm STILL always hungry. I have to say that I'm very sensitive to SSRI's though - my body didn't tolerate Prozac or Lexapro well either.",Bee
17,Paroxetine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 5, 2018",4,"I love paroxetine, I feel fearless and self-confident, can do great on all activities, and much better on job. I really feel I have changed, I am more me than ever before. When iIwas 4 years old i suffered psychological abuse from person who was working at my home. She used to humiliate me, threaten me about killing me and family if I told someone, for about a year. After that, I had horrific nightmares for several years, nocturnal eneuresis, fear to anyone. So I grew up with lot of anxiety and depressive periods, at 18 I fell into a depression for 2 years, til my father, a doctor, prescribed me paroxetine. For 10 years I depended on him for medication. I didn't feel comfortable cause at the end he didn't believe I was ill. So then I started going to other doctor, now I feel I can take  my loved paroxetine when I need it. I will take it for life, but I am so happy  and  I prefer that, it doesn't disturb me anymore.",Spanishq

I rarely felt that I was thoroughly enjoying anything that was going on in my life, it completely numbed me out to a traumatic experience that I should have been dealing with and as a result of being on it I did not fully process that experience until getting off of the medication...

Paroxetine has always worked for me without too much side effect. The first few weeks a little nauseous but then it passed as I got use to it (I started with 20mg and now on 10mg). The only drawback is that I've put on weight (one stone extra in the last 7 years but I would rather be a little overweight and well in my head).I've tried to stop on two occasions in the last 7 years by gradually going down to 5mg and then less and then nothing. On both occasion my body reacted well for about 6 months and then out of nowhere I started to have panic attacks again each time. I've decided to keep taking 10mg.,Frenchy69

I ran out of it, and the withdrawal side effects are not fun, for me I got really depressed and crying, and the headaches are horrible.

I got ready in the morning and broke my hair dryer, straightener, and brush. While waiting in the doctors office I felt like I was going to scream, cry, or assault random people in the waiting room.
