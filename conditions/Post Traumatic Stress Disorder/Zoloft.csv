1,Zoloft,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2022",4,"I switched to Zoloft after many failed years of Lexapro. Last week I started Zoloft at 50mg, this week I’m on 100mg. I have severe PTSD that has gotten to the point where I literally can’t stop panicking no matter what and I also have extreme mood swings. Even the short amount of time I’ve been on Zoloft I’ve felt a noticeable difference in my mood. My panic is getting better, I’m not swinging from guns blazing to depressed void. I have some side effects right now while I’m adjusting, been sweating and have a fluttery feeling in my chest (anxiety probably). But, I’m really looking forward to next weeks and months on Zoloft!",Elizaishiding
2,Zoloft,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,,"November 12, 2021",5,Can’t recommend this medication highly enough. After suffering from panic disorder and a bit of PTSD symptoms for years I really lost myself and was becoming suicidal and severely depressed. I took lexapro for years and worked well for a long time but began to stop working for me as well as it had in the past. Switching to Zoloft saved my life. Intrusive thoughts have diminished and even if they do pop up they hold no weight like they used too. Panic attacks are gone and my general mood is back to normal. Side effects were pretty minimal. Upset tummy for a couple weeks and aside from that nothing. Sex drive is as healthy as ever which I know some people get concerned about. I'm on 50mg at the moment and am happy to increase if things change and I need some more help. Took close to a month for me to feel the fullaffect. Don’t be afraid to take this medication as side affects are minimal and really subside after a few weeks. I hope this helps someone struggling.,Trent

4,Zoloft,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 28, 2021",2,"I have been on sertraline/Zoloft for 5 years. It has saved my life. I have experienced a lot of trauma growing up especially through my teens. It wasn’t until my 20s that I was finally diagnosed with PTSD and after being misdiagnosed with depression for years and treated with many other meds which never helped me, sertraline was a saving grace. I no longer go from 0-100 with my mood and episodes. I no longer have panic attacks. I no longer have suicidal ideation or attempts. It saved my relationship and I have been a better mother. I am wanting to see my doctor to slowly decrease from 100mg a day (I started on 200mg), and eventually come off them completely. The only negative I have had is slight weight gain. I’m still healthy but I have gained around 7kg - I exercise and eat well. I’m not overweight but IO do struggle to shift the excess weight I’d rather not have!",Rach
5,Zoloft,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 12, 2021",0,"So I've had severe panic attacks, anxiety and depression from losing my mother in 2010. I had tried others before taking Zoloft and they weren't as good as taking Zoloft. I have finally stopped taking it because it has made me gain sooo much weight. I was 135lb when I started and am now 200lbs but other than the major weight gain it has helped me. The withdrawals are pretty bad currently but I'm hoping that now that my life is in order and great that I can't do it without it. Just wanted to tell my experiences",Heather
6,Zoloft,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 10, 2021",1,"Took 25 mg for PTSD and panic disorder. I'm a 23 year old male, I was put on the lowest dose because I didn’t want any terrible side effects. Even at the lowest dose I suffered almost all of them. No appetite whatsoever. I felt disassociated from reality. My mood was all over the place and I got hot flashes and tremors. They say to stick it out and it all gets better but how is that possible when you can’t even function for three weeks straight? My advice would be to not take Zoloft. It’s just not worth it I would rather have panic attacks and deal with them normally. I was insane on that drug literally crazy.",Anonymous

8,Zoloft,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,7.0,,"August 5, 2021",1,"125mg of Zoloft a day has been a lifesaver for me.  I was hospitalized for disorganized thoughts, panic, a flat affect (lack of emotions) and an inability to function. My brain was so messed up it was a struggle to do easy things like order off a menu or hold a conversation or stay awake. My brain kept getting cloudier and I believed there wouldn’t be a cure until I was put on this medication. Suddenly everything stopped getting worse. Slowly in the next few weeks I felt better, less panicked and depressed, no more thoughts of suicide, more clear thinking. Luckily I have had no side effects at all, only slight nausea when starting. I will say that the downside is that after a few months I found the medicine no longer made me happy but instead just made me numb. It’s still a lifesaver but I’ve had to add other medications to treat my depression. It also helped a lot with OCD though, basically curing my OCD.",Othraccountt17

I was taking 25 mg for only two days and couldn't keep going due to side effects. The side effects started with extreme nausea on day one, then diarrhea, heart racing. Day two was horrific I fell asleep and woke up with heart racing, sweating, shaking, and dry heaving. I considered going to the hospital. I took a xanax and a shower and luckily it calmed down. I only had that one episode but continued to have the extreme nausea and heart racing into day three. I stopped taking it after the second dose and the nausea has gone down significantly and I could eat a little. Definitely couldn't brave through the side effects. It truly scared me.",Shan44

I've been taking 200mg for 4.5 years and I should really be on more, which my doctor suggested, although I decided to cut it off here.I never really experienced any side effects except for a bit of a very, very mild uncomfortable stomach for 2 days initially and feeling extremely ""wired and awake"" when I woke up in the mornings for a bit, after increasing the dose.The reason I started to take Zoloft is because I experienced extreme paranoia, hypervigilance and extreme anger/rage. I used to hate people with a passion and I feel like this medication makes it easier for me to be more at ease around people. If I wasn't on medication I felt I could be a danger to someone.

I had my birthday and I was having all these symptoms and couldn’t even enjoy! I wish I could just stop them in this second but I know it’s not wise and it could be dangerous. Never again. I just couldn’t believe it took away the most important thing in my life: my orgasms!!! I normally reach one in one minute with porn or my toys and I also experience multiple.

I have been on 50mg for 5 months now and continuing it for the treatment of PTSD.I have had PTSD since 1998 and going through more trauma makes it to where this medicine helps with the brains desire to drag and have flashbacks.I still have flashbacks but it helps lessen the impact on my feelings.Like a numbness to the pain almost. If I miss a day I sometime get suicidal or crazy off the wall if I forget one day of my meds.I take Abilify with it in the morning for Bipolar Disorder too which works great with it.I still have my memories that meds can’t erase but time and the drug helps to maintain a level sound mind instead of all over crazy!I am much nicer of a person to be around on my meds.

Now, I've been feeling like it's working less, we've tried to add on different things.

I was in panic mode 24/7, but I could sleep even though when I woke up it didn’t feel like I did. I would wake up, cry, go to school, cry, get on the bus, cry, get home... cry all night until I fell asleep. I was not depressed before I started taking it but I was during.

23,Zoloft,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,3.0,,"April 25, 2020",7,Started taking Zoloft on September 8. The first month was very tired with headaches. October: headaches and no appetite that persisted until third month. Had some hair loss and diarrhea for a month or so in December. Then I had nausea and bad brain zaps around February 9. That was when I was fully off for a week. Jan: I was taking half dosage whole month. Now it’s April and I still have a few dull brain zaps when I’m really tired or if I cried. Plus the sexual side effects did not go away. Decreased libido and I don’t feel horney anymore. There’s literally not the same feeling as before I started taking the medication. Not as much natural lubrication either. The doctor that gave this to me told me nothing about but gave me a print out. Always ask what medications that your doctor is supposed to be upselling before accepting ANY. ALWAYS look at the warnings. Sadly this did not work and it’s taking me a long time to try to get back to a normal libido and mind again.,VP

You hope there is one answer to fix the torment you know as life. There is hope because there is an answer, it takes a bit of searching to find your personal recipe.

It was the best time of my life and I didn’t know why.I met my husband and just had our third child 3 weeks ago and have been back on Zoloft for 3 weeks.

Decreased intrusive thoughts/images, almost no olfactory flashbacks, no panic attacks. However, like most other people, my libido was completely wiped out, insomnia hit me hard AND I became incredibly paranoid, believing my husband of 23 years was cheating on me (he wasn't and has never). Unfortunately, it seems that my body has adapted to it and my symptoms are coming back. I would say for me, it's an okay short term drug (6-12 months) but definitely not a long  term  solution.

I was on another medication that was okay but not great.  Instead of asking my doctor if I should just go up I requested a new medication.  I started feeling bad about two weeks into it.  My doctor who I love and respect told me to go up about every week.  So at 8 weeks I am a freakin mess.  Abdominal pain of unbearable proportions.  Anxiety of the charts with all the lovely side effect.  Tomorrow I start fresh.  For anyone other starting a new med watch how it effects you.  If it feels wrong have a good rapport with your dr or therapist.  Give them all the information if it feels real bad then don’t mince words tell them.  I will get better hopefully sooner rather than later.  You will too.  You are strong and you are special.  God created you that way.

Anti Depressants, sometimes made the anxiety worse. I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2015 and my Psychiatrist prescribed Zoloft.   Zoloft was really helping me but I gained about 15 pounds in 2 months so I stopped taking it.   Fast forward to today. I finally got back on Zoloft after realizing that I NEED it.  I literally have been in survival mode for years.  After getting back on Zoloft I can finally function.  I didn’t know what it was like to feel normal.  The constant flashbacks, anxiety and depression are gone and when they do show up they are manageable.  Zoloft has made such a difference I can’t believe I was living in the Hell I was living in for so long.

Before I started on it, I was having constant intrusive thoughts of sexual assault. I was afraid of going outside. I was afraid of my phone. My anxiety was out of the roof. I was so easily startled, all the time, and would constantly be trying to suppress emotional flashbacks so that I could go to work or be with my partner or do menial tasks like wash the damn dishes. Now, I feel like I have mental space—like I have the choice to take care of myself and to work through my trauma. Memories which were incredibly scary for me to even think about are now memories that I am able to access (in part, sometimes) and confront. Zoloft has given me my brain back.

It's wonderful in combination with Lyrica for my GAD in which I'm in the-4% that gets euphoria from it.",poppyjuice
89,Zoloft,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 1, 2012",90,"Zoloft pretty much saved my life. I was suicidal due to my trauma and many life failures. I hated the medicine at first, though. The adjustment period is horrible. I felt constipated, sweaty, sleepy, high and dissociated from the real world. Once you get past that (it takes a couple of months), it is great. I am so much more relaxed now. I used to be very aggressive and now I think about other people's feelings. Being depressed from my trauma, I was very tired. Zoloft made me more tired until I adjusted to it. Now it actually gives me energy.",LillyF
90,Zoloft,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,,,"February 2, 2012",71,"I suffer from post traumatic stress disorder. I am 47 now. I have had panic and anger issues all my life to the point I wanted to hurt someone. I have used Xanax in the past, but it was just a band aid. My doctor put me on Zoloft and I have never been so centered in my life. Nothing rattles me and the people I work with and my family enjoy being around me now. I don't care if I have to take this the rest of my life as long as it makes me feel this in control. The only side effect has been increased sex drive with difficulty ejaculating and my concentration is a little off.",A New Life
91,Zoloft,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,,"December 14, 2011",26,"Zoloft treated my symptoms very well. The only problem was my inability to ejaculate. Need less to say, I had to discontinue this medication due to this side effect.",lockjaw

93,Zoloft,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8.0,,"December 6, 2011",61,"Best thing that has ever happened to me. I suffer from anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder. At first I wanted to stop taking it because the side effects were too much, as in tiredness and nausea. Once I had been taking it for a month and a half to 2 months I have no side-effects and I have a significant better quality of life. I take 100mg and I slowly increased and found it was a good spot for me. For a while I had the shakes and it bothered me but those are gone now too and I have been on it for about 5 months. With therapy and Zoloft I am a much happier and less anxious person. Keep trying and keep taking the medicine. It's worth it I promise. I am 19.",Anonymous
94,Zoloft,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8.0,,"October 9, 2011",48,"I had a traumatic experience with an ex-boyfriend of mine three years back and I've been fine. I am now deployed and doing missions in Iraq and have seen a few explosions and what not and I think that's what triggered my Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I was hesitant about trying medicines but they said I could take them and still go out on the road. So far they seem to be helping lighten my mood and actually want to get out of bed in the morning and not worry or get irritated and paranoid at random times like I normally would. I am also taking it with clonazepam, which is helping a lot! No side effects yet, hopefully none to come! ",Sly :)

96,Zoloft,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,10.0,,"May 15, 2011",88,"I have had PTSD for 15 years, I was skeptical about taking medication for my condition, thinking each day I would fight on and get better without the aid of medications. I have finally sought help and have only been taking Zoloft for a short period of time and already I feel the difference. I feel happier and my general mood is more positive, the negative thoughts have diminished considerably.  I have had no bad side effects to date.  My advice to anyone hesitating is just pluck up the courage and talk to your doctor.",Anonymous
97,Zoloft,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,9.0,,"March 7, 2011",99,"Well I've been off and on of zoloft and when I'm taking it my friends notice a very big difference. They say that I'm always a lot happier and more of a go getter. I just wish I would of been using it when my ex-fiancee was living here with me because well we'd probably still be getting married. As for side effect's I haven't seen really any at all, I still have a very high sex drive, I still eat like normal, and I'm a lot happier during high stress situations being in the military. But I've been taking 25mg a day in the morning and it help's tremendously. But like people say on here you just have to take it and see if it's for you or not. Hope this review helps everyone out.",Anonymous
98,Zoloft,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8.0,,"March 9, 2010",50,I starting taking Zoloft 8 weeks ago. I was extremely stressed out and was suffering from PTSD due to a bad car accident. After about 1 1/2 wks I really noticed a difference. Not stressed anymore but I do feel a bit Zombie like. I also have a problem with memory and focusing. Also really tired at night. Overall right now I guess it is worth the trade off. Also have intestinal issues but hope it will go away.,PTSD Victom
