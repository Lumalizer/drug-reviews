0,Nortriptyline,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,10.0,,"April 17, 2021",8,I tried a number of different anti-nausea medications and was misdiagnosed about 5 times over the course of a year. I went through cycles of vomiting so bad that I couldn’t eat drink anything for 2 weeks and ended up in the hospital for dehydration. IV fluids helped for about a week or so and then I started getting sick again. Finally my gastroenterologist decided we were going to try 25mg of nortriptyline and within 6 weeks the vomiting nearly completely stopped. I still get sick about once a month give or take but tend to just vomit once and then feel fine. Much better than daily vomiting and gastroparesis brought on due to it. I had been on SSRI’s before but the vomiting occurred on and off of those because they work differently. I also have no side effects unlike other antidepressants. Highly recommend giving nortriptyline a try if you’re having gastrointestinal distress with no known cause.,Grace

I take it every night at bedtime and it has taken my stomach pain away. Only very rarely I’ll get episodes now.",Emsly

4,Nortriptyline,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 19, 2015",10,"I began feeling nauseated years ago, out of nowhere. Whenever I ate, I got sick. Even times I wasn't eating, I'd feel nauseated. 'Id get bad migraines that could bring it on or come after the vomiting. So nauseous to the point I was vomiting non-stop and in the ER at least once a month. YEARS went by and nobody could figure it out. After being diagnosed by doctors at Riley childrens (once i turned 18 they stopped talking to me) and doctors at the Mayo clinic, I began taking nortrityline and it has worked MAGIC. My ER visits are down to a few times a year versus every month.",Anonymous
