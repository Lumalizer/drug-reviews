0,Sumatriptan,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,8,,"March 14, 2017",5,It is fairly effective if taken in time. Usually with a nausea medication too. Doesn't fully resolve symptoms but takes the edge off and helps with vomiting. It is also very expensive medication.,Anonymous

3,Sumatriptan,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,7,,"October 28, 2010",16,I take sumatriptan for the onset of my migraines and nausea that come along with my CVS. On bad days they help a lot. The only thing is I usually have to take more than one dose and the medication is expensive even with insurance.,amfrancis
