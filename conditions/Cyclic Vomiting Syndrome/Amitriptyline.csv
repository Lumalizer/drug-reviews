I was having episodes of nausea and vomiting, making me rapidly lose weight and very weak. Once I started on Amitriptyline my episodes became very mild, with just a little nausea and burping.

1,Amitriptyline,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 26, 2022",0,"I was in and out of hospitals for about 2 years. Every 2 months or so I would have episodes that would require me to go to the ER because of dehydration. When I started Amitriptyline, the vomiting stopped, though I did have to get my dosage increased when the migraines started. But after almost 8 years, I am off of Amitriptyline and I have never been better!",Grace
2,Amitriptyline,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 22, 2021",1,"I was on my death bed. I went from 145lbs to 118 in 3 weeks.  My cyclical vomiting took 2 whole years to get diagnosed. Within those 2 years I was in the verge of dry heaving 24 hours a day for the WHOLE 2 YEARS! My doctor's had tested me for everything under the sun. My life as I had once known it had ceased to exist. My family had to raise my children for me. My brain was so screwed up from malnutrition, dehydration, emotional and mental strain that I began having seizures on and off all day long and for days on end. I was a shell of my once self. A listless entity. A near vegetable. When it was finally discovered that I had CVS I was prescribed amitriptyline because apparently CVS has similarities to migraines. Amitriptyline is from what I understand mainly used for that. After the many, many other different prescriptions I had tried none at all had worked.. until then. l have been free of my nightmare of an existence for 3 years now. If I go more than two days without it I'm back to square one.",Tiffany

I went from about 190 lbs to 138 lbs and was ready to die. I had been to the hospital 4x and no drug or testing would help.

I stopped vomiting now for 4 /12 months and gained all my weight back (very hard to do as a diabetic!).I recently tried to quit the amitriptyline and within 2 days my symptoms came back.

Extreme weight loss as too nauseous to eat. Took 25mg amitriptyline for 1 month but then had urea breath test which came back positive for Helicobacter Pylori. Have been treated for this and am now nausea free. Did not have a problem stopping the amitriptyline after such a short time of taking it.

12,Amitriptyline,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,1.0,,"May 4, 2020",11,"I have chronic nausea and vomiting from what my doctors believed to be GERD. But even while on 80mg daily of pantoprazole, I was still having intermittent issues with nausea. So my GI suggested amitriptyline. I started on 10mg for 2 days with little difference. So I went up to 20mg at night. That first day was great! I wasn’t nauseous, I had energy to play with my kids. But that second dose of 20mg made me feel horrible. Anxiety, shakiness and I couldn’t sleep. So I am stopping the medication. Come to find out (thankfully now rather than later) that this drug has a HORRIBLE withdrawal attached to it. So I’m glad I only have 4 days to detox from, but even this short stint with the drug is making me feel horrible. Continued shakes, anxiety and nausea. And it hasn’t even been a full 24 hours since my last dose yet. So if you plan on taking this medication be forewarned that you’re either going to be on it for the rest of your life or have a hell of a fight trying to come off.",Vanessa

I am frequently put in the hospital due to my CVS - not being able to stop throwing up to the point where I vomit blood, get extremely dehydrated and suffer from extreme/painful nausea. Recently my Dr. put me on Amitriptyline to help with my chronic nausea, headaches and depression. Before this I was on Zoloft. Since being put on Amitriptyline (it's only been 2 months) I have gained quite a bit of weight. I have also been suffering from EXTREME belly bloat and insanely vivid nightmares. My mood has not changed or gotten any better. I know this drug helps a lot of people sleep but this does not have the same effect on me. It has also not helped with my nausea whatsoever. I am tapering off of this awful medicine and am going back to my Zoloft until I find something better.",Audrey

16,Amitriptyline,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 25, 2018",19,"After years of testing and misdiagnosis,  it was finally discovered that I have cyclic vomiting syndrome.  My doctor was not well versed in the condition and was reluctant to try any treatment and just said ""There's nothing you can do about it."" I did my own research and after I again conveyed how traumatic a CVS episode was,  he agreed to try prescribing me Amitriptyline in a low dose.  I've been symptom free ever since! I had lost all hope and words can't express what a relief it was to not be nauseated constantly.  Only bad side effect was it makes me extremely tired,  especially in the mornings (I take it at bedtime). It also sometimes made me feel ""blah"" personality wise,  like I was kind of sedated. Minor problem was it gave me dry mouth in the beginning.",Ben35

I am able to go sleep nice and sound and my pain is not there anymore. It has also opened my appetite and for some reason I am always thirsty now. Not a bad thing as I wasn't able to drink a lot of water for fear of starting an episode.This medication has been a life changer and I would suggest anyone who has an uncontrolled case of CVS to suggest this as a treatment option to your Dr.",CristianV
18,Amitriptyline,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 22, 2018",3,"My daughter was diagnosed with CVS (cyclic vomiting syndrome) last year at the age of 17. Prior to this she was also diagnosed with hypothyroidism and Polycystic Ovarian syndrome. She was put on his doses of metformin which the doctors believe kick started the CVS. However after being taken off of metformin she got worse. Her doctor started her on 25mg of amitripiline and now she is up to 50mg after a month due to her cycles being more frequent. She has lost about 15 lbs in a week in her prior episodes. Currently on the 50mg she has not vomited and her nausea seems to be gradually getting better. When she started the 25mg at night she didn’t seem to have any drowsiness.  However, upon starting the 50mg she was extremely sleepy and groggy. It took her about a week for these to subside some. We kept backing her time to take it in the evening so she would not feel so out of it the next day. Currently her thyroid is once again out of whack so that may have something to do with that as well.",Henny Penny
19,Amitriptyline,Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 12, 2018",6,"I originally started on Amitriptyline 50 mg (at bedtime) as a treatment for Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome. It helped immensely with this. Additionally, not long after taking it I noticed it helped with several other issues. I struggled with anxiety for a long time without treatment and had even had an anxiety attack where I thought I was dying and went to the hospital. After starting this, my anxiety problems disappeared entirely. Additionally, it helped a lot with chronic pain associated with having Crohn's Disease. I also sleep a lot better. I have been taking the amitriptyline for about 3 years now. Only downsides were some wild dreams and being a bit cloudy in the head in the first couple weeks. Also, if you take this regularly and miss a dose, you'll be out of it the next day.",Jonathan

It was sometime until the doctors and I figured out what it actually was. Nonstop throwing up for 2-6 days about once a month.  What made them severe I guess was the amount of vomiting. A few times I had double I.V's  because they could not rehydrate me as fast as the vomiting was dehydrating me.  If you have CVS and are reading this I just want to say I am truly sorry. It was a miserable and emotional ride for me and the people that care about me.  I can truly say I feel your pain and I pray that you find peace.
