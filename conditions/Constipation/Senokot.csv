0,Senokot,Constipation,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 31, 2022",0,"I used senokot last night around 9:30 pm. I had eaten a lot of food that day and still didn’t have a bowel movement so I took one of the laxatives, and went to bed. I woke up the next morning with awful stomach cramps and I didn’t know if it was from my period or from the senokot so I went to use the bathroom and everything came out, after that the stomach cramps stopped. It’s now 11:15 am and my stomach is just a tiny bit uncomfortable. I think it’s because I didn’t get EVERYTHING out yet. But I didn’t have a terrible experience with it. I probably won’t use again incase I get more of the other terrible side effects that I am terrified of.",Senokot
1,Senokot,Constipation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 15, 2022",0,Took this at night before to help with constipation. Next morning small movement. And then slowly the pains built up to intense stomach cramps that lasted well into the early hours of the following day. Unable to sleep. 3 days later and things are still not quite right. Never again.,JWA
2,Senokot,Constipation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 10, 2022",0,"That stuff ripped through my intestines and gave me diarrhea and chills for hours. It doesn't just relieve constipation, it gives you a colon cleansing. Would not recommend it unless you have a really strong stomach or really bad constipation. The box saying it's gentle is a lie.",Do not use!
3,Senokot,Constipation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 28, 2022",0,Took one pill before bed at around 9pm. At around 3-4am (I can’t tell you the exact time as I blacked out) I got extreme sharp pains in my lower abdomen that lasted until around 8am. The first sharp pains I got up to take some paracetamol but ended up passing out and woke up on the floor with a nice lump to the back of my head which I had hit on the radiator on the way down. No idea how long I was out for but felt sick when I woke up so tried to get to the bathroom. Next thing I remember was being on the bathroom floor so must have passed out again. Pain was excruciating and spent the rest of the night on the bathroom floor. If my husband had been home I would have gone to the hospital it was that bad- would have been a little embarrassing but after loosing consciousness probably would have been a good idea. Wasn’t able to get to my phone to ring for help either. Would give this one star as I did manage to go to the toilet at around 11am the following day.,Unhappy

If you’re reading this after the fact then have some still water, milk, yoghurt or camomile tea. It should help and avoid spicy food and fizzy drinks",Do not take!!!
5,Senokot,Constipation,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2022",0,"I am a 26 year old man who can handle a dodgy stomach. 1 senokot and I suffered extreme stomach pain and watery poo like someone putting there finger over a hose. It was the worst! I took at 11:15pm, woke up at 4:30am like a burst fire hydrant, then 7:30am came the second wave. I had to work that day and turned up late. I was practically useless due to the diarrhea every hour. The stomach cramps were on and off constantly throughout it all and were terrible. The only reason for the second star is because it did work. It’s was just one of the most awful experiences of my life. Avoid at almost all costs unless it is your ONLY option!",Charlie H
6,Senokot,Constipation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 4, 2022",0,"Oh my god how I wish I could go back in time. I took one tablet last night as I was quite badly constipated and I regret it SO much. I have had a terrible sleep, with horrible abdominal pains (equivalent to my bad period cramps), cold shakes and lightheadedness - I went to the bathroom when I could finally bare to move and I am somehow more constipated than before - so bad that I actually collapsed/passed-out on the toilet and have cut/bruised my eye. I am so so scared as I’m only young and alone at Uni at the moment and I genuinely feel like I may die the pain is that bad.Please, I suffer from constipation often, and I would rather be constipated all those times than take this again. Don’t take it!",Reviewer
7,Senokot,Constipation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 3, 2022",0,"I took one tablet as had felt constipated  for several days. Shortly after taking it, I was in a serious condition, doubled over in pain much worse than labour pain, I thought I was going to die. I screamed with the pain of each contraction. This went on all night and for several hours after.  I was in a cold sweat and sat on the toilet screaming all night. I did not want my young daughter to be frightened, so kept the door shut and used the toilet downstairs.  I felt completely exhausted and wrecked for days afterwards as if had been through a babies labour. I wanted to call an ambulance but was in too much pain to move from the toilet. I have never experienced pain like this and have had long labours with 3 babies weighing 10 lbs. This was unbearable and the pain 10 out of 10.  I have not gotten over it, it was terrifying. I thought I was going to die. Please do not take this poison.",Maisy
8,Senokot,Constipation,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 26, 2021",0,"I've been on Senokot for about 4 months with no issues. I take two, 8.6mg at 10pm at night and usually at about 11am the next day I either have a brief abdominal pain followed by some gas or brief abdominal pain followed by a bowel movement. Today however is different. Today I woke up with that pain at around 9:30am and it was severe. At about 11:40am it got so bad I puked up all my liquids then it quieted down for a bit. It's now 1pm and I still get quite extreme cramps although less frequent and I still haven't been able to pass gas, let alone a BM. It's 3:40pm now and I feel like I might be okay, I haven't had a cramp in about an hour. I found a way to lie down in my bed where I wasn't cramping as much and that seemed to put me on the right track. For the love of God though, be warned. I've dislocated my shoulder, broken ribs, my back, elbow, chest plate, I've even gone through heroin/fentanyl withdrawal and those Senokot side effects was the worst thing I've been through.",sublocade user

Hey presto bowel movement of lessening density no more than 5 times that day . Problem solved I thought.

10,Senokot,Constipation,1.0,,"December 11, 2021",0,My wife was prescribed this and Miralax.I wish I had read the reviews here before her taking it.She has only taken one at a time but the detachment from reality problem Senokot makes is a very big no go for my wife.We will not be having her take this anymore.Thank you to all who posted their honest but terrifying reviews of this medicine.Like all medicines this must work for some but it has not helped my wife go bathroom at all.With the detachment from reality thing we cannot use Senokot anymore ever.The Miralax helped pull water from her legs but only ExLax pills help her go poop.I hope this helps you out there.God bless you.,Caretaker
11,Senokot,Constipation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 4, 2021",0,I was nervous to try Senakot after reading the reviews on this site but I just wanted to post to say if you have opioid induced constipation it's worth giving senna a try. I can't comment on constipation in general but for OIC Senakot worked perfectly for me. Took 2 tablets at night and another 2 in the morning. By the evening I was all cleared out with no side effects whatsoever.,JoelM
12,Senokot,Constipation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 21, 2021",0,"Never used before, so only took 1 tablet. One if my worst life decisions.  The pain I endured when my intestines felt like they had exploded inside, reminded of the Aliens film where the alien comes out of the chest, only with this drug, no alien but a violent physical contortion, the like I have never felt before.

14,Senokot,Constipation,5.0,,"November 2, 2021",3,"I've taken Senokot before and it usually works. This one time though, I had SEVERE side effects. Bad stomach cramping, grumbling, shooting pains, going to the bathroom every 7-10 minutes, burping like crazy, weak and nauseous, chest pains (what I imagined having a heart attack feels like), and watery stools. I've never experienced anything this bad before. I've never had a baby before but I imagined this to be worse than labour pains, minus the giving birth part. I had so many things planned for the day but I spent it curled up in a ball. The second day was better, less frequent bathroom breaks, but when I ate something, it started again. I honestly considered calling 911. Hopefully the third day is better. I'd give it a five for the side effects. I've only taken two this time, before I used to take four and nothing like this happened before. Take with caution, seriously.",Grace
15,Senokot,Constipation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2021",2,The first time I took senokot it made me have a bowel movement within an hour but was ok. The second time I took one all hell broke loose. I don't know if having IBS plays a part in it but I get severely constipated and don't have bowel movements for up to a week sometimes but I took the senokot and once again within an hour I was on the toilet. I had a bowel movement. And then another. And another. In total 10 times since I've taken the pill over the course of the day. I have felt lightheaded all day and feel as though I am going to pass out every time I make my way to the toilet. I have barely eaten anything today just because my stomach is bothering me so much. Now trying to sleep but paranoid that I might end up needing to go for another bowel movement soon as my stomach is making some crazy noises. I would rather be constipated the side effects are not worth it I have been lying in bed all day unable to do anything at least when I am constipated I can still go on with my day to day,Flowerpickle
16,Senokot,Constipation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 19, 2021",3,"Senokot is a disgusting medication, I don't even understand how it's even legal to sell this.Not only does it not get rid of constipation, it gives you more problems on top of it.Basically: Gas, Nausea, Extreme dizziness (Sometimes I feel disconnected from reality), extreme farting, diarrhea (Yes, I have constipated diarrhea now, even I don't know how it works, basically a bit of poo comes out like water around the solid bit of poo that stays inside inside and creates cramps, making the constipation even more unbearable).

I took one tablet after not having a bowel movement in around 4 days and 6 hours later got the worst diarrhea I've ever had in my life, think liquid, explosive and painful. It happened on and off for a few hours and was terrible because I had just had surgery and was not the most mobile. I also had unbearable abdominal cramping to the point of nausea. I was surprised by this reaction, since it seemed like a safe bet of a stool softener and my chemist recommended it highly.",Cragan

19,Senokot,Constipation,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 7, 2021",1,"On top of fiber supplements, and Miralax, I take stimulant laxatives once in a while for severe constipation. I have IBS, so I’m careful to only take one Senokot. I’ve been dealing with fecal impaction for a while, and there have been times the Senokot didn’t do much besides give me stomach cramps. I may not have taken enough. The strange thing is, about 3 oclock yesterday I took a single 25 mg pill (half the recommended dose of Sennosides) and by nighttime I had a successful bowel movement, but to my dismay, the movements didn’t stop. Now I’m having watery diarrhea, with incontinence. The stomach cramps are gone, but over 32 hours later I’m still dealing with soiling. I’m not sure why. I imagine it will stop soon, but I’ll be reluctant to ever try it again with my IBS. One good thing I can say is that it definitely worked. As far as comparing the cramping pain to childbirth, it is a similar feeling, but nowhere near as painful for me.",Jane Doe

I had been struggling with on and off constipation for 2 months. Nothing would fix it and I would feel bloated and uncomfortable and it knocked my confidence. I took 2 tablets with food at around 8pm. Had a bowel movement at around midnight and again the next morning.

I am now getting testing done with my Dr but in the meantime he put me on benefiber daily and miralax if needed. The miralax bloats me up and causes horrible stomach pains but never produces a bowel movement  (took it 6 days straight once and had no luck so I had to have a xray to rule out a blockage..no blockage was just full of poo,Happycamper

25,Senokot,Constipation,,,"July 19, 2021",3,I actually would recommend this product when you feel uncomfortably bloated. I took/take one tablet at night if I feel the need with a mixed herbal tea. The next morning you do need a bowel movement and you do get some cramping but if you don’t take more than you need it’s bearable and relieving. Heed the warnings though if you think you might not tolerate this or you’re tempted to take more than you should - DON’T. You will be on the loo on and off with severe stomach cramping for hours and hours. I took 2 one night and I could barely walk around town the next day I was in so much pain with my stomach and feeling sick. Can have really horrible side effects but if it’s needed it’s needed.,DayleA

I took the recommended dosage and waited. However over night I started to feel nauseous, this feeling intensified as the night went on until I was actually being sick. Everything and anything I ate or drank (including water) came back up. I had to go to hospital and I was given morphine and cyclizine (anti sickness) to help with the projectile vomiting and nausea. I had to stay in hospital for a month after using this. Horrible experience and it didn’t relieve my constipation at all. The minute I was discharged I threw the whole packet in the bin!

28,Senokot,Constipation,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 12, 2021",1,"I was initially directed to use this post-op and because of the medications I was on caused constipation. It worked when all else failed. I generally took one or two and by morning I would go and the side effects were mostly mild. I now use it for IBS occasionally. That was until yesterday. By 10pm I was having trouble. After taking one, I noticed a few dizzy spells then overall weakness. It escalated to difficultly breathing like an elephant was on my chest and intense gas. My heart was pounding, got extremely anxious and I began vomiting until I had broken blood vessels around my eyes. I took a half dose of Zertec which helped for a bit, then another half when it started again. Finally got some sleep after 3:30am and woke up still feeling under the weather with swollen eyes.  I really thought I was headed to the ER if it worsened. It’s 8:20 pm the next day and I feel beat up with light chest tightness & gas. It was great until it wasn’t.",Kellipart2

I panicked and tried several other methods and nothing worked. Then I tried Senokot. I took 2 tablets and within 6 hours I had a gentle bowel movement.

I hadn’t been for a couple of days, they were in the medicine cupboard so I took one tablet before bed on a Friday night having never taken a laxative before.

I don’t know about emptying your bowels....I thought my bowels would be following on out, closely followed by my intestines and any other vital organ that got in the way.

I have had some random pains but they never last long, and find myself passing gas after taking a dosage. The end product is successful. Make sure to drink lots of fluids with and after your dose. It makes a huge difference! Also, for comparison, a while ago I tried dulcolax and it was a nightmare. I felt so nauseated and actually vomited. Groaned and convulsed in pain for hours.

49,Senokot,Constipation,6.0,,"February 15, 2020",10,"I took 1 tablet before bed for constipation as advised by a pharmacist (I’d had diarrhoea on Saturday then hadn’t been at all for 5 days - usually I’m every 2-3 days). The senakot made me have a bowel movement the next day, around 14 hours after I had 1 tablet. Then I went again a couple of hours later. I started to feel quite sick at this point, really uneasy stomach, not much of an appetite. I still ate lunch and snacks as normal and didn’t feel like I needed to be sick - just crazy nausea. Then a few hours later, I went again but it was more like diarrhoea - then I felt VERY sick. I had to go to a pharmacy again for nausea relief (I was taking a flight to go on holiday so I wasn’t going to wait for it to pass naturally!) - she gave me Pepto Bismol in liquid form instead of tablets - it worked like a dream and I’ve felt fine ever since.

Long distance travel is a prime culprit. I have found if I do not go at least once per day it compounds the problem. If I find I cannot go by bed time I know there is a problem brewing. I know this because as hard as you try there is nothing there. So I take a senokot. I usually follow this up with sultanas and high bran cereal. It does the trick. I then review how much I have drunk and my food and adjust it accordingly.Sometimes you can get a little  colicky pain but it passes as soon as you go Never take it habitually only as a last resort.,Harry

Stools were not soft &I  had to strain despite taking stool softness (these have never worked alone but read that taken with Senokot helped). At my wits end because nothing aside from enemas work. I eat prunes, plenty of fruit, dried figs & tons of vegetables. I can't take the cramping side effect which I never had with Magnesium Oxide.",Chronica
108,Senokot,Constipation,7.0,,"October 11, 2017",16,"Ok, I'm gonna give you advise if you have never taken this medicine before, make sure you have the next day off. Don't try to take this med before bed, thinking you'll have one go at the toilet and your ready to go. Second I would try changing your diet, an enema or even miralax before considering this med. I was having stomach pain and had an xray of my stomach and my Dr showed me how stopped up I was, it's amazing how much the body can hold. Anyway I say all this because it does clean u out but yes your cramps are close to something like food poisoning cramps, because it's forcing ur body to do something it can't effectively do on its own. I hope this helps.",Needs to poop

110,Senokot,Constipation,7.0,,"September 26, 2017",24,"After spending 2 hrs reading the reviews for Senokot.... I was deathly afraid to take them. I finally caved and I took 2 at 12:30 am. I felt nothing except a few minor rumbles the next afternoon. Finally about 6:30 pm I started getting cramps. Yes they hurt a little. But when you spend half your life constipated, a little pain is nothing if a good BM follows.... and it did. By 7pm I was in the bathroom. Took a few minutes but it worked well and felt about 5lbs lighter. Went once again about 15 minutes later. Loose stool. And that was it!! So, while for some this med obviously causes them great pain or just doesn't work at all - I was all for it. Chronic constipation is awful so it was worth it to me. Don't let the reviews scare you.

I tried prunes and fybogel - but no movement. I couldn't bear it.I took 2 senokot 2 nights ago before bed - nothing. I took another 2 after 12 hours. About 2 hours later. I had a rather painful hard bowel movement, a couple of hours later I had crippling stomach cramps - which led to a further 2 bowel movements, each getting softer (but no diarrhoea). I had another before bed that night - back to my normal consistency, then another on waking this morning. I am delighted. Was it a pleasant experience? No. Would I do it again? Albsolutely!",Susie36

I took yesterday at 7am was fine all day till after dinner at 6:30.  Then I felt major gas like pains that took me to my knees. The pain had me sounding like a dying moose. Then came the nausea and vomiting felt like the worst food poisoning ever. I was so hot and sweating like crazy then literally freezing. The urgency to vomit and poo made me loose total control of my bladder . I was so weak from the torturing pain I could hardly speak or move. I wanted to lay down in fetal position  not moving to prevent the pain to come back. During all this I felt delirious & my heart was pounding the whole time through out the night.

Thought my system was holding onto something bad I ate so I decided it needed a little help expelling big bad toxins. Senokot did just that and more! I took one dose at 9pm. By 3am I was on the pot with explosive diarrhea. It's 630am and I'm back on the pot writing this warning for others to heed. I have to travel at 9am. I hope this ends soon as taking Imodium is not idea either. I probably should have drank prune juice instead.,Explosive Diarrhea
