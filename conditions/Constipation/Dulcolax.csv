0,Dulcolax,Constipation,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 29, 2022",0,"I suffer from IBSC so I decided to try Ducolax as they are easier to carry around for travel. BIGGEST and STUPIDEST MISTAKE EVER. It was the 2nd last day of our beach holiday and I was feeling pretty back from all the food consumed so I popped 2 of the pills around 3pm. I went to the toilet around 5pm and thought that was it. Now I know that was just my normal bowel movement because the next morning around 6.30am I woke up with a terrible twisted and bloated stomach ache which preceded with me sitting over the toilet bowl for the next hour writhing in excruciating pain. I felt nausea, cold and dripping in cold sweat. The poop eventually turn into diarrhoea with a bad stench towards the end. Luckily we were headed home so it didn’t completely ruin our trip. Worst experience of my like. I usually take a bowel bulking solution like Dufalac and it’s gentle and works well for me. You might like to consult your doctor about this solution. I’ll stick to it from now on.",JoJoYeoo
1,Dulcolax,Constipation,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 26, 2022",0,"I just want to share my experience, it's my second time trying out dulcolax, I remember the first time I used it was year 2017 when I couldn't poop after I gave birth due to the trauma, it was a week of not pooping and when I took it I just waited for at least 2-3 hours and it worked. Only took 1 pill and it works well easily, no diarrhea, no cramps, just plain BM. Now, March 2022, I am having abdominal pain on my left lower side, thinking it might be gas or constipation so I once again took Dulcolax, first pill at 1:30pm, then had BM around 3:30pm, and I also take a second pill 8hrs after the other which was around 9:30pm, wherein I woke up at 6 am with my tummy rumbling and a little cramps, got in the toilet and right there it's like waterfalls, spent about 5mins in the toilet to finish it all, after that I'm all good. Guess we all have different experiences, but my advice would to take it slower, 1 pill at a time, give it some time to process, do not rush taking dulcolax.",Zelle

3,Dulcolax,Constipation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 22, 2022",0,Oh Dulcolax… Do me once shame on you.  Do me twice shame on ME.  And this time I should have known better.  I pretty much had the same experience as everyone else on here.  Missed a day of work (won’t get paid for that) and had to lie because I could not say that I had gone from not pooping in over a week to having explosive diarrhea and severe cramping that was horrible enough to make me have suicidal ideation.  Literally I thought to myself If I have to live to like this I will surely end my life; burning in hell for all of eternity will be a relief compared to this pain and agony.  And my stupid self went and took it again because I was so afraid of getting as backed as the first time.  I was right in that it wasn’t as severe but it was still awful and I will never again take Dulcolax unless I already have a death wish and am suicidal and masochistic simultaneously,NeverAgain
4,Dulcolax,Constipation,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2022",1,"Worked well, however maybe a little too well. Cleared me out completely but had to run to toilet and tummy cramps.

5,Dulcolax,Constipation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 9, 2022",0,"Took 2 pills and woke up about 3 hours later in excruciating PAIN! I had such sharp pain in my abdomen. At one point I started puking so much I literally thought I was pooping through my mouth as it was the same yellow color as my poop. Cold sweats, confusing and profuse pain. I just wanted to pass out to get some type of relief! At one point the pain had gotten so bad I asked Jesus to come take me out of my misery. There is no way that stuff should still be on the market.

Due to my constipation being so severe I took 2, and then read the reviews…. I was absolutely horrified and very very scared!! Lucky my experience was completely fine.  Some stomach cramping but nothing in comparison to the pain felt by the constipation.  I took mine around 14:00 and they worked at about 08:00 the next morning.

9,Dulcolax,Constipation,6.0,,"February 20, 2022",0,"Firstly I can not believe you can buy this over the counter. This has got to be the worst bowel movement drug I’ve ever taken. I felt fatigue, I started vomiting whilst sitting on the toilet, I was in the most excruciating pain. I thought my inside was going to fall to the bottom of the toilet pan it was horrendous. 6 hours later I was still running to and from the toilet. Surely this should not be legal.  This drug is effective it does the job but you will pay with pain.",Run's

11,Dulcolax,Constipation,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 24, 2022",0,I took highest dosage. I too cried out for Jesus to make the pain stop. I too had worst pain of my life way worse than child birth. I too saw stars had the cold clammy sweat pouring down my face. I too felt dizzy and barely could feel my legs. I too literally made it to my bed and passed out! I have never had anything like that happen before. I too wanted to call an ambulance but was too weak.

13,Dulcolax,Constipation,1.0,,"January 8, 2022",1,"So I would suggest no one on planet earth take this! I have been constipated for almost two days, I suffer from IBS so my bowels constantly change. I was desperate and asked my mom for a laxative. The lable said 1-3 so I’m thinking it’s ok to take 3 because I was in pain and my mom said she takes 3. I don’t know what type of iron stomach she has but I’ve had 4 bouts of diarrhea in the past 9 hours. And not your regular diarrhea but the scary stuff! Head hurting, terrible cramps, almost like labor and I had a natural child birth, this was worse! I even felt like I was going to pass out at one point. Now I’m sitting laying on the couch with just a towel over me because I don’t know when the next explosion come. I might go to the ER because I’m pretty sure I need some additional fluids. This is absolutely horrible. DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN ONE!!! I could have taken half of one and been straight. It got the job done but now I’m weak and tired.",Lady E
14,Dulcolax,Constipation,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 1, 2022",0,"I took 2 tablets around 2pm yesterday and nothing happened until 8am today. It gave me cramps, they're painful but bearable in my experience. After a while of cramping and feeling nauseous that’s when I knew, I should go to the bathroom now. The poop was normal at first then turned to almost diarrhea. I honestly think it was because I took 2 tablets. I suggest for anyone using these to take only 1. Overall I tend to get constipated frequently, therefore I feel these definitely work because it took a load out of me. Other than that I wish they were just more gentle.",Brit
15,Dulcolax,Constipation,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 16, 2021",1,"So first time using this yesterday; I hadn't had a proper bowel movement in almost a week. I took movacol religiously as a kid so I assumed two little pills couldn't even budge, but what the heck. HOW WRONG I WAS!!!I took them at 6:30 pm and by 11pm I was dripping with sweat & in excruciating pain (I'd always dealt with cramps but this was a whole new level of pain) I was having severe contractions and tummy rumbles with no signs of movement for hours. Lots of puking and going from couch to floor to try and get comfortable. I got my partner to call the ambulance, as I was convinced I'd ruptured an organ or something ridiculous.The pain subsided and I called the ambo off and went to sleep, woke up 4am and my butt was a literal tap, no more cramps though! Will be throwing this out, this should be prescription only AT LEAST!Also pro tip for cramps; sit in child's pose and hug a pillow that's folded in half. Or sit under hot shower, only two things that stopped the pain.",Bellcat

17,Dulcolax,Constipation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 25, 2021",0,"At first I thought it wasn’t too bad, I took one pill and 6 hours later I was able to go and I felt better. I had a little discomfort as I laid back down but I figured that was normal. Here I am 6 more hours later absolutely miserable. I have a massive migraine and I’ve gone many more times somehow even though I don’t have anything left in my body. I’m lightheaded and shaking and going between sweating and being freezing.I’ve been dry heaving and I feel like throwing up would actually help but nothing will come out because again, my body is pretty empty. I drank plenty of water when I took the pill too and it didn’t seem to matter. I was desperate at the time but I threw away the rest of the box and will never ever us this product again.

20,Dulcolax,Constipation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 19, 2021",1,"I was a little behind on my regular schedule of pooping. One morning I woke up with mild pain in my abdomen but I wanted it to go away. I live with my  mom who went to the store and bought this product. I took three tablets because they looked super tiny. It said take 1-3 and I wanted fast relief so I took three. After about an hour I had my first bowel movement and was relieved. However, about another hour later I was on the toilet again when I began to feel EXTREMELY nauseous. I stood up and threw up more than I thought was even possible. I then thought I just had a little stomach bug and went back to my room to lay down. Another hour later the same thing happened again and at this point I am drenched in sweat but freezing cold. My heart was racing and my back was on fire. This continued to happen for 8 hours. At one point I was very much considering going to the hospital because I thought I was at risk of dying",Anonymous

Never have I felt so close to the brink of death… and I’ve almost died before for real. The combination of chills, intense stomach cramping, and nausea was absolutely insane. I have endometriosis and the stomach pain from this was comparable to my period pain except for period pain at least I can use opiates. For this I literally had no choice but to sit and cry it out. I was so sure that I was going to pass out from this that I sucked up my pride and texted my roommate telling her to come check on me every 20 minutes to make sure I was still alive. I took 2 basic doses and I’m a 5’4 female with average BMI. If you are my height and weight PLEASE ONLY TAKE 1. It might not seem like it’s working but it will, it’ll just take time. DO NOT TAKE 2.

23,Dulcolax,Constipation,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 4, 2021",0,"Well I take these pretty regularly, one doesn't tend to work, 2 does. Now I always drink lots of water, I learnt the hard way. I take the tablets about 7pm and at 6am I start to get mild cramps  then stronger. I go to the toilet, little pressure then a normal bowel movement. Upon returning to my bed I get those cramps and head back to the loo, softer and then this repeats 2-3 times more during the next 1 hour. Last visit to the now stinky bathroom and it runs out of me like a waterfall. Off back to bed. I get up 1-2 hr later feeling great as I am no longer constipated, swollen and uncomfortable. Next lesson I learnt was not to eat and drink straight away or its nearest loo in quickest time or its a change of knickers. I wait a bit, and then have a small drink, will still go back to the loo. Then alls fine. These tablets are the only thing for me that works when I am constipated. Yes you get the pain, feel like you are going to faint whilst on the toilet, cold cloth & windows open helps.",Nicola

It’s currently 1:38 am , I’m sitting on my bathroom floor with a pillow crying feeling like I might actually die . I took these at 8:00pm and my insides feel like they are in intense pain. Not to mention the pharmacist suggested this to me !!! He obviously  wanted me to undergo this amount of pain. All I want to do is lay down, but I can’t , I can’t lay down and I can’t sit up. Every time I poo , I vomit . So I have a bucket and I'm on the toilet. So I've been here desperately googling this tablet to see if anybody else had the same thing. It’s nice to know I'm not crazy.

At 5 am I woke up with extreme stomach pain and felt very nauseous. Went to the toilet and slowly began a bowel motion but the pain was horrific for at least 40mins. I also had excessive sweating from the pain I was experiencing, then the diarrhoea began for an hour.  I nearly rang for paramedics as I was struggling not to pass out. Got myself into a cold shower at 6am and sat on the floor for a good 20 mins which was the only thing that helped me. After a good hour or so, cleaned myself up and got back to bed.

27,Dulcolax,Constipation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 31, 2021",2,"Amazing experience - so far. I haven’t had a bowel movement in 14 days! I tried everything, from other laxatives to even giving myself an enema and NOTHING. I finally went to the doctor and she suggested dulcolax. I took one pill and then came here and read reviews. I was TERRIFIED (and honestly rolling around laughing at some of these) but then switched to the good reviews and followed their suggestions. I downed so much water. After 12 hours I only had a minimal movement so at 24 hours I took another one, with lots of water again. No cramps, no near death experiences and now after another 12 hours had another minimal movement. I can’t believe that some of these people were only backed up for a couple of days and decided to take 3 PILLS AT ONCE!?!? My doctor also said ONLY 1 pill every 24 hours. I am hoping it continues to work in a slow and healthy way.",Anonymous

29,Dulcolax,Constipation,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 27, 2021",0,"I suffer from constipation and have been for a couple of years. This stuff is the only thing that works! I usually take two pills before bedtime with lots of water when I haven’t had a bowel movement in a few days.I tend to wake up 12-3am with bad stomach cramps & sweats which usually keeps me up 30 min-1 hour. Then an hour or two later I have bowel movement.Sure, the cramps aren’t fun but it’s your body trying to push everything down, so I just suck it up. And then the next day I may have to run to the bathroom a few times but most will already be out. If you just have a one-off constipation I’d recommend using the suppositories instead, as these will allow bowel movement quickly without any pain. But obviously these won’t allow you to empty ‘everything’ if you suffer from non-stop constipation like me.Alternatively give movicol a go - it did nothing for me personally though.",Joey

So my first experience with it I took one pill at dinner time because I was constipated for 5-6 days. Then literally nothing happened. Not when I woke up the next morning either. So I take another pill and I start having cramps right before I go to bed but very mild ones. It was nothing like what was about to come. I honestly had a hard time sleeping that night from the pain and kept waking up. Eventually at around 8 am it became unbearable and I rushed to the toilet only to be in excruciating pain, nausea and dizziness. Then I had diarrhea that literally would not stop I've never experienced such an intense toilet experience!  So over all it worked for me after 2 days but it was really difficult...

I took the pills at about 11:00pm and at around 1:00am the cramps started. It was mostly in my lower stomach area but it felt so bad I wasn’t sure if I was going to throw up or poop, and to be honest, I was scared of both. Around 3:00am the first poop came, if you can even call it that. There was so much diarrhea I started doubting if the toilet water was even there. Almost every 30 minutes I found myself running back and forth from the bathroom, basically just leaking out water.

Then the raging headache came and heart palpitations. My heart rate was so high, I had to take beta blockers to lower it and calm me down. Constipation is much more pleasant than dealing with this.

You could have Laxido instead because that works just as good.,Fluffy20

Did not experience any nausea described by other users, some people say that you must drink water to avoid insane cramping, and although I have done this, I cannot avoid the mind numbing pain that comes with taking this medicine. On a positive note, it does work and empties you out, giving you quite a considerable a list of trips to the toilet. I'd definitely advice staying home if you’re taking this. I usually only take this when my usual Osmolax medicine is not working, which isn’t very often. In summary, it does work but gives you a lot of pain.

58,Dulcolax,Constipation,10.0,,"August 7, 2021",0,Have been dealing with chronic constipation for years due to  a disability. This med really works for me-maybe I am just lucky-I am sorry to hear so many of you have had horrible experiences. I take a few once or twice a week-to get pooping that often for me these days is a real improvement and I need to be sure I co-ordinate my proximity to the loo and a carer hence the timing of my regime.  The cramps do happen but I can tolerate them.I get a bit of a fever feeling but that is short lived.  What I do on my poo pill nights is take them late in the evening as they take a good few hours to work on me - say about 10 hours but that is due to my system being slowed down by disability. That gives me some hours when it is safe to get some shut eye and sort myself out to get to the toilet the next day. The initial evacuation may sometimes be a bit of a struggle but from there on in my bowel is pretty much cleared after about three or so trips to loo. Hope sharing this info helps.,Tess

And yes I have used it more than once because clearly I have a death wish. Within 2 hours the cramps start. The type of cramps where you can’t lay down, but also you can’t sit up straight because they are ripping apart your insides. By morning I am awake at 7am unable to sleep because of cramps. It usually takes 2 hours of excruciating pain to be able to actually go to the bathroom, and after that your running to the toilet once an hour quite a few times. Fun fact 24 hours after I took this stuff I trusted a fart and crapped my pants :) so taking this is not a fun time, but everyone’s experience is different.

84,Dulcolax,Constipation,9.0,,"May 24, 2021",2,"The comments here are a bit dramatic so, as a one year user, I figured I should share my experience. So, I’ve been dealing with severe constipation and IBS for years and I had to go to the hospital every two months due to extreme pain. And yes, I’m eating lots of fiber and yes I have been to the doctor many times and the only treatment that kind of worked, gave me diarrheas EVERY day, so I turned to dulcolax. Yes it gives you terrible cramps, some may describe as birth cramps, that last 1-3 hours till you get everything out. TIPS: 1) Drink lots of water before taking it, otherwise you will get extremely dizzy. 2) Sometimes it may take more than 12 hours to work so, for instance, make sure to take it around 7-8 at night if you want to be finished before 12 in the morning. 3) Speak to your doctor and make sure there are NO other options for you before you use it. It is an addictive drug and It should be your last choice. Hope that helps :)",KatherinePapa

The contents of my intestines are well-hydrated and soft; the nerves in charge of the whole process just don't seem to do their job and induce peristalsis. That's where this medication comes in. It is a stimulant that irritates the bowels enough to get them to move. If my bowel contents were hard, this med would likely give me a bad time.I take ONE 5mg tablet (and keep in mind I've been constipated for literally decades) at midnight and I'm in the bathroom by 10am the next morning.

On the Bristol Stool chart (that is a chart the doctors use to classify your poo), I’ll often have type 1 stools which are like passing rocks out of your butt and take an eternity while tearing your rectum apart. So I took 4 duclolax pills and over the course of the day, things improved, but I did feel some nausea and I had 4 BMs. So it will definitely make you poop. I normally drink coffee in the morning and then just go every morning once. On Dulcolax, as I wrote, I went 4 times  in 1 day, but it did change the stool shape positively. On the Bristol chart I probably ended up at type 3 (normal) by the evening so I generally think it’s a good product if you suffer from pooping rocks like I do. That is the worse feeling in the world and this will fix it, but you will go multiple times in the day.

I then slept through till morning but woke feeling sore and with a massive headache. Then experienced severe cramping in the middle of my stomach, nausea and loose BM for the rest of the day.

I wouldn't recommend using this unless the constipation has progressed beyond the scope of using a stool softener. Because Ducolax is NOT a stool softener.It's a STIMULANT LAXATIVE. That means your gastro intestinal muscles squeeze really hard to get rid of anything insidePlease understand, this is not for tum-tum discomfort, it's for clearing a blockage, and it will ABSOLUTELY clear your constipation. As with any type of medication, one should assess one's tolerance the first time taking this. The directions say 1-3 tablets, so start with ONE. Don't START with 2 or 3!! Also, expect some cramping and other side effects. If you take the right dosage, it will likely be unpleasant, but, tolerable.

I went and sat on the toilet, but instead of coming out the back end, I vomited into the trash can while my stomach violently cramped. So many things crossed my mind. Maybe this is what happens to those women who didn’t know they were pregnant until they started going into labor (the cramps were that bad). With the amount I was sweating, I then considered that I was having a heart attack. Or maybe my gallbladder was flaring up? I have a history of debilitating menstrual cramps so I know what pain feels like. This was a whole other level. I had almost forgotten that I took Dulcolax until I saw it on my nightstand, which is when I got on the internet and found these reviews.

YAY!!!The cramping to me is minimal, as my periods are way worse. It does give you bubble guts and makes you go, I would rather deal with this then chronic constipation or fecal impaction - that’s the worst ever and had that 1 month ago and trust me, that can kill U!So to me if U deal with constipation this medicine works just like it says it will!Drink lots of fluid before and after as this cleans your system out. Stay hydrated. I wouldn’t take this before bed though, I would take on a weekend first thing when U wake up and have access to a bathroom close by.

I have IBD and sometimes I get constipated. This really helps. Yes the pain can be uncomfortable (to some unbearable), but take some anti-inflammatories and you'll be fine. The cramps are a signal that the meds are working like they are supposed to. Trust me as someone that has a bowel disorder and has had 5 colonoscopies before the age of 30, this works. It JUST TAKES TIME! I know poo pain. I know poo cramps. I know the pain! It sucks! It really does! Yet, it is effective. There are some people that may not be able to handle it, but others can.

One hour later, the worst diarrhoea ever, just couldn't get off the loo. Every twenty minutes the same thing, finally fell asleep around five in the morning for one hour.

About 4:30a I awoke with terrible cramps & gut gurgling. Felt pressure building (wasn’t a fart) & made to toilet. Sat down & wooosh. Bowel gates broke wide open. Sat awhile then back to bed. Got right back up for more on toilet. Up & down about 3 hours. Explosive movements each time for say 6 trips. Fell back asleep about 8am feeling cool & sweating. Woke 1pm to ready for work Tuesday. I was wiped out. Felt like was hit in gut few times fighting. Tired. Drained. Ended up taking personal day off. Stayed in bed & drank water. Ate little. Woke Wednesday feeling so much better.

The nausea continued the whole next day, but I also was in a coma like state. I literally slept the whole day. I felt like I was in and out of consciousness for 24+ hours. It helped with the constipation but the price my body paid was a high one. Next time I will look for a softer easier way.",Liz

I'm lying in bed now and feel a lot better but stomach still feels a little dodgy.

I was begging my mum and sister for water. I was tearing my clothes off while sitting on the toilet. I managed to make it to the hallway, all of a sudden there were flashes of lights in front of me everywhere and I was on the ground. I had passed out. The paramedics arrived to find me in my underwear and a see through singlet on the floor in the foetal position. I was suffering a panic attack and I couldn't breathe.

Being that I was constipated for a few days, I took THREE. I woke up around 1 am not knowing if I had to vomit or poop. The cramps were extremely intense that I questioned if it was partly because I ate almost an entire box of cheezeits before hand, after reading the reviews, I know it was the dulcolax. It lasted about 9 hours, I even blacked out at one point. In between rounds I would stumble my way to the couch, with the fan on high  thanking god for my time on earth before I had to leave it.

I fell asleep at 10pm and woke at 12:40am with the most painful stomach cramps/gas pains I'd ever experienced. I sat on the toilet in the dark pushing with each stomach cramp. I must have been more focused on the pain because, to my surprise, I had been passing the largest pile of semi solid stool in my life. These cramps came and went as I passed 3 more massive piles of stool. I have a very high pain tolerance, but these cramps were BAD! By 1:45 they ended and I felt like I could fall back asleep.Overall, I probably would only take this if you absolutely HAVE to take a laxative. But be prepared for cramping.",Survivor1

My doctor had recommended high fiber foods, and lots of water. When that didn't help, and I was feeling more pain from the constipation than from the surgery, he suggested a laxative.

Felt amazing! 3 hours later, it took it's vengeance. Cramps, sweating, nausea, and painful diarrhea. Didn't dare move off the toilet for hours and still made trips to the bathroom through the night.

About three hours into the dulcolax alone (about 3:15) he said he was cramping, nothing major though. After drinking all 8 glasses of the added solution, he started getting cold sweats (he was freezing in our 80 degree room!), having muscle spasms in the left side of his neck and left shoulder but claimed to no longer have cramps. Not sure which medication it was that could have caused that. I looked up the side effects to both and neither of them said anything like what he is experiencing now. From what I see on here, the cold sweats seem to be from the dulcolax.

411,Dulcolax,Constipation,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 16, 2018",1,"I've had a positive experience with dulcolax. After reading all the negative reviews, I'm wondering how many could have simply been resolved with a few strong cups of coffee! I've had chronic pain for the last 6 weeks, and unable to 'go' for the majority of 4 weeks, and this has been made worse with my tablets (codine & gabapentin). After numerous suppositories and hospital laxative drinks that haven't actually worked, I decided on trying a herbal tablet. It's worked really well for me. I followed the leaflet, and took one tablet with a pint of water for the first night (6-12hr tablets). I had one soft BM this morning, and another at the 12hr mark. Such a relief to finally have a decent BM! Going to take it again tonight. If you have severe/chronic constipation like me, I would recommend dulcolax, however **ensure you follow the guidance in the leaflet and ensure you are well hydrated**!

""I took X, then this happened. X is bad and at fault."" It's more likely you would have gone through the same experience at a later time, and the laxative just brought it on sooner.

I only really use it when my constipation is particularly bad - it's one of those things where you really have to make sure you are very close by to a bathroom for at least 24 hours after taking it. It's definitely not the most comfortable experience - you will get stomach cramps and be up on the toilet for most of the night. But it's definitely effective. To me it is worth it  to get cleared out and not have to deal with the nausea and pain that comes from being severely constipated.,Anonymous

511,Dulcolax,Constipation,,,"April 23, 2017",7,Dulcolax has helped but I agree it comes with stomach cramps. For fast relief of constipation yet I feel much easier on the stomach is magnesium citrate.  Find it in anywhere. I have also found it very helpful if you feel you have a hard stool to pass. It may take hours but eventually it will break down stool which I find to the point it's not terribly painful to pass. For regular constipation the results are usually very quick. For hard stool it may take a good portion of your day but if you can take the time to plan on being near the bathroom because you will pass other stools before you pass the hard stool and eventually the hard stool will breakdown.,FLG

If you have it because your bowel muscles have stopped pulsating well and good.   If you have it cos you've not been able to go to loo and your stool is now too hard and big AVOID. I had a major back spasm could not move for two days - bend and sit on a toilet hahaha-  then I was prescribed a muscle relaxant (diazapm/valium) which relaxes ALL your muscles...  I've not been now for 8 days but all duculox has done for me has given me a desperate need to pass stool that's more like a brick!!!  I really needed something to make it softer  :(,Lotbyname
