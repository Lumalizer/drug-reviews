1,MiraLAX,Constipation,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 7, 2022",1,"I have been extremely constipated ALL my life and it only got worse as I aged. I just knew there was no help for me. Laxatives are not the answer but a last resort at times. My Gastro Dr told me she had so many patients, many seniors, taking Miralax daily, even multiple times a day and it is absolutely safe. I was shocked and skeptical. That was 9 years ago and I am now a believer. I have IBS c and d so have to make minor adjustments nightly in dose. However, it has been a Godsend to me. I now take only 1/2 teaspoon nightly usually and it works great daily for me. Using too much can cause side effects but many of us use a much smaller dose on a daily basis. NO problems at all and I am 75. A wonderful blessing.  Good luck all.",Dory

So I started taking Miralax as soon as the constipation hit. This last time it took 5 days for it to work.  It worked!  Had an ""accident"" in a store and had to rush home!  So embarrassing.  But it does produce regular to soft BM's.  I am trying to take a fiber supplement everyday.  Need to drink more water I'm sure.  I have anxiety disorder and take meds for that, but have for years, so hoping that more water and just benefiber will be helpful.  It seems that miralax for me is a once in awhile thing.",Nina

5,MiraLAX,Constipation,2.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 4, 2021",2,"I have always had trouble with being constipated, ever since I was a child. I have a sluggish colon with gastroparesis. I remember having to go to the emergency room several times throughout my childhood due to severe stomach cramps and my parents being told that I had stool backed up almost to my stomach each time. Now, with those issues in tow, I also have IBS-C & Opioid Induced Constipation. I have tried Movantik, Linzess, Amtiza, Milk of Magnesia, EX-LAX, stool softeners, fiber (which is a nightmare and can obstruct your intestines if you have low or slow motility like I do), and all the other tricks in the book to alleviate constipation. I can take Miralax 4 to 5 days with absolutely no change in bowel movements but a lot of negative effects such as intense waves of nausea, intense gas/bloating/stomach pain, headaches, and feeling extremely ill. I experience electricity type sensations throughout my entire body with vomiting. It literally feels like I've been poisoned.",hEDS w OIC

7,MiraLAX,Constipation,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2021",1,Do NOT use this product if you’re constipated. It only made me poop every 4 days… maybe it was because the medicine I was on caused constipation (I was getting off often  it)! Never gave me explosive diarrhea like I needed.

It doesn’t matter the dosage, I just get super nauseous every time and get stomach pain with no constipation relief and am ultimately told to stop using it.

I took 1 dosage of Miralax after I woke up with warm water. Then I drank 2 tall glasses of water within the next few minutes and I drank another 2 tall glasses of water within 30 minutes. In less than 1 hour of taking Miralax, I had the most glorious bowel movement that I've had in probably a few weeks. I just had to make this post. I was shocked how fast it worked and I think that taking it on an empty stomach after waking up and downing several glasses of water helped to expedite the effectiveness. But I am very excited. I used it once before several months ago but I didn't follow the same protocol and in that case it took about 24 hours before it work and I don't think it worked this effectively. But I recommend taking it with warm water. I hear that warm liquid aides in bowel movements. Also the multiple glasses of water right afterwards should help flush you out.",Miralax Works

12,MiraLAX,Constipation,3.0,,"August 3, 2021",1,"At first, whenever I would take it, it would kick in in about 2-3 days. However, whenever I seem to take it now, it makes me feel like I have to poop but nothing comes out. I’ll be sitting on the toilet for hours, feeling like I have to poop, and being in excruciating pain, and nothing will come out. It’s absolutely awful. This is what is happening to me right now. I had to take 650mg of acetaminophen and a pill my doctor prescribed me for abdominal pain just to make the discomfort more manageable-and it’s still so hard on my insides. It’s been two days now and the pain has only gotten worse. It’s always a mixed bag, sometimes I’ll take it and I’ll feel great! More often than none though, I’ll take it and either nothing happens or I’m in pain. For reference, I weigh 145 pounds (small and pretty slim stature), and I’m a 5’4 female.",B

Several months later doctor said I developed a very deep anal fissure in which he suggested another surgery. My dad suggested I take miralax for a few weeks and see what happened. It ended up taking 3 months combined with Pranicura which you can buy online. Works very well. (Make sure you apply to inner rim of anal canal. Don’t apply internally). I am like 90% recovered and this is almost 9 months after first surgery. Surgery was Oct 27 2020. Started miralax Feb 2021.

I have not had a solid bowel movement in over 2 weeks, (I stopped taking the miralax  a week ago)  I am gassy, poopy and have to buy stock in flushable wipes as I've gone through so many.  It's like ""fire in the hole.""  I would have thought after being off this medicine for a week things would have gotten back to normal, but it is anything but normal.

Do not chug the drink! I was told to drink within 8 hours but if it goes over a little thats fine. Also was told to stay moving! Helps the bowels and if you lay down could make you throw up.

I’ve been having major issues with hemorrhoids, fissures, and honestly who knows what else. I could only go every 3-4 days and it would be so painful. I would panic before I went. I would be in extreme pain for up to 8 hours after each BM. I was afraid of living. After an extremely painful BM, one I almost couldn’t pass myself, I decided to try Miralax. I had already changed my diet, upped my fiber, drank excessive amounts of water. 3 days after taking this, and 3 days after my last very painful BM, I went. And it was soft, quick, and only a little painful (a 1 or 2 on a pain scale instead of a usual 8-10). I cried, from happiness. I didn’t think I could ever not be in extreme pain and fear.

One thing may work well for 1 person but not for the next. So just cause there’s a bad review of this product for 1 person doesn’t mean it’s bad for everyone.

I have a constant pressure in my bladder and I have to go to the restroom more often. Also when I need to go I can't hold it, it's very uncomfortable if I try. I was working for constipation, that's why I had been using it everyday.  I was already checked for infection, UTI, and other issues.

I woke up at 1 AM and spent the rest of the night and following morning staggering back and forth from bed to the bathroom in agonizing pain. When the waves of cramping hit, I could barely stand or move. Excruciating! The worst part was, the consistency of my stools was so weird that I just kept having to go very little amounts at a time. It felt like the misery would never end. Especially after my poor insides had been scrambled around during surgery, this was one of the painful things that could happen. I even passed out for one hour in between all the madness and had a vivid nightmare that I was deceased and no one could help me.

It does a wonderful job. Effortless, painless, easy, quick bowel movements and relief within 24 hours. It's very effective. But taking it is a pain! Every time I take it, it tastes so bad (the flavorless one) no matter what drink I put it in that I have to drink it holding my breath with a straw over the sink in case I vomit and rinse my mouth out with soap afterwards. It's actually conditioned me to stop drinking some beverages because the taste reminds me of when I mixed it with miralax. I gag so badly after taking it. The nausea and burping from it usually lasts for 2 hours after I take it and I have trouble keeping it down and not vomiting from the taste.

50,MiraLAX,Constipation,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 14, 2019",153,Although MiraLax works...it makes you have ice cream soft serve like bowel movements..the bad part for me is I will feel like I have gas and will just let it go and you shouldn't. Don't trust a fart - you will poop on yourself. For real. I just did. You also need baby wipes after bowel movements otherwise you will go through a whole roll of toilet paper trying to clean up your backside. I'm glad I've been able to have movement but I'm not ok with the side effects of it. I may just start taking something else to produce bowel movements. Maybe I'll try benefiber and see what that does. But it took about 2 days for me for it to work. I have to take excedrine pm for me to sleep and I think that's what causes my constant hard ball constipation.  So this helps but I can't be at work and poop on myself and or not have wipes to get fully clean. It seems to just cling to backside.,C

It ached a bit afterwards, but the process was very, VERY quick and you could NOT believe how relieved and relaxed I felt afterwards.

The last two months, I was lucky to go once a week. My stool was so hard and big that it hurt to much to go. My doctor prescribed Miralax to me and it started to work a little. Then, she recommended I take two cap fulls in two cups of water instead of one in one. After a day or two, I went to go and it literally went from 100% bad to 100% great. I was not only able to go but it didn't hurt at all. It was so amazing to finally not be in pain that I literally cried. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone with that kind of constipation.",sk_sen

Each time I took at night an hour before bedtime with water and it's amazing because there really isn't a taste at all. You would never know anything was added to the water. Just make sure you stir it so the water is pretty clear to keep it tasteless. I do have to say over the last 4 days I haven't had any bloating or gas.,Anonymous

So not normal. My diet consisted of high fiber 100 oz of water a day fruits veggies but still no bowel motion. I have tried cleansers, laxatives and other products but nothing. I recently began doing colonic irrigations because I was so frustrated. My doc suggested I try Miralax. The 1st day I took some in the morning and the 2nd day I took some more. By that evening of the 2nd day I had a bowel motion. I couldn't believe it. After all this time it was Miralax that did the job. Thanks Miralax. I would recommend this to anyone.",jennlacole

I take Miralax every night at bedtime in hot tea, after typical day of drinking 2L  water, eating an extremely high-fiber diet (veg except for fish, exclusively whole grains, cook with extra-virgin olive oil), and some walking, along with lots of tea both green and black. The Miralax helps, but still only 1 movement per day, versus 3  prior to medication. When I double the Miralax, THEN things start to approach pre-medication regularity.",anti88

Those medicines made me constipated, and while I was at Childrens ER, my nurse practitioner prescribed me MiraLax. I was skeptical, and afraid that it would counteract with my other medications. She assured me that it would be okay. Did you know, you don't have to take it just once a day? I took 2 doses at once with 16 ounces of water, and a couple of hours later, I finally had a bowel movement. Overall this medication is really phenomenal. The only bad thing about it, is that it causes gas and nausea. Other than that, I'd say this is the best constipation reliever for all ages out there!",KameronMae14
