1,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 7, 2022",1,"MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350):I have been extremely constipated ALL my life and it only got worse as I aged. I just knew there was no help for me. Laxatives are not the answer but a last resort at times. My Gastro Dr told me she had so many patients, many seniors, taking Miralax daily, even multiple times a day and it is absolutely safe. I was shocked and skeptical. That was 9 years ago and I am now a believer. I have IBS c and d so have to make minor adjustments nightly in dose. However, it has been a Godsend to me. I now take only 1/2 teaspoon nightly usually and it works great daily for me. Using too much can cause side effects but many of us use a much smaller dose on a daily basis. NO problems at all and I am 75. A wonderful blessing.  Good luck all.",Dory
2,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2022",1,"I started having constipation in my early sixties, the rabbit form.My doctor recommended Metamucil which I have taken faithfully forseveral years. I also drank lots of water, more movements but still rabbit form.I eat fibre foods but it does not help much. I finally decided to try Emolax recommended by a doctor.  It worked about three days after taking the first dose and taking it each day the same time. RELIEF, it was great to have a normal soft movement so easily.  Tiny bit of cramping but not uncomfortable.  You should definitely try it.  It works and is very easy to take, no unpleasant taste.Metabolism slows as we get older and we must not let our bowels become impacted, very uncomfortable, very dangerous.  This is simple relief for a very common problem. It is not fun being obsessed with our bowels, takes away the joy of life!",Anonymous

So I started taking Miralax as soon as the constipation hit. This last time it took 5 days for it to work.  It worked!  Had an ""accident"" in a store and had to rush home!  So embarrassing.  But it does produce regular to soft BM's.  I am trying to take a fiber supplement everyday.  Need to drink more water I'm sure.  I have anxiety disorder and take meds for that, but have for years, so hoping that more water and just benefiber will be helpful.  It seems that miralax for me is a once in awhile thing.",Nina

I have a sluggish colon with gastroparesis. I remember having to go to the emergency room several times throughout my childhood due to severe stomach cramps and my parents being told that I had stool backed up almost to my stomach each time. Now, with those issues in tow, I also have IBS-C & Opioid Induced Constipation. I have tried Movantik, Linzess, Amtiza, Milk of Magnesia, EX-LAX, stool softeners, fiber (which is a nightmare and can obstruct your intestines if you have low or slow motility like I do), and all the other tricks in the book to alleviate constipation. I can take Miralax 4 to 5 days with absolutely no change in bowel movements but a lot of negative effects such as intense waves of nausea, intense gas/bloating/stomach pain, headaches, and feeling extremely ill.

It only made me poop every 4 days… maybe it was because the medicine I was on caused constipation (I was getting off often  it)! Never gave me explosive diarrhea like I needed.

12,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 27, 2021",1,"I have chronic constipation of unknown origin. My gastroenterologist recommended I take Miralax daily, indefinitely. For the first couple of weeks it was a godsend. Nice, solid, slightly mushy poops--some of them pretty massive in length. I'd stare at my handiwork in amazement--I don't recall eating that much food to cause such massive poops. The poop was semi-solid so I was a happy camper. After a couple of weeks, I was feeling great and then BAM! Brick wall! My beautiful, semi-solid poops turned into explosive diarrhea. I'm talking mostly watery poops that would splatter all over the inside of the toilet bowl. If that wasn't bad enough, I'd get these screaming meemies 3 to 6 times a day! Over the last two months I've had all of one semi-solid poop. The rest were screaming meemies. To make matters worse, these spells were unpredictable. Every time I try to expel gas, I have to be very cautious as the liquefied poop has a tendency to create 'problems.' Not a good thing to experience.",Donald Fuller
13,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Constipation,,,"September 26, 2021",0,"I would suggest to folk that have hemorrhoids and fissures to put an ice cube in a baggie and hold it against your hemorrhoids or fissures.  It helps to cool it, reduce it and retract it.  Also, wipe around your area with Vaseline or muko.  It helps to grease the area for stool passage.  Also, you could use your finger with a disposable examination glove on it, covered with Vaseline or muko and do your own gentle manipulation or persuasion.  Insert near the back wall and gently gently move your finger around and up and down.  You might be surprised how much this helps.",Cdh

Then I drank 2 tall glasses of water within the next few minutes and I drank another 2 tall glasses of water within 30 minutes. In less than 1 hour of taking Miralax, I had the most glorious bowel movement that I've had in probably a few weeks. I just had to make this post. I was shocked how fast it worked and I think that taking it on an empty stomach after waking up and downing several glasses of water helped to expedite the effectiveness. But I am very excited. I used it once before several months ago but I didn't follow the same protocol and in that case it took about 24 hours before it work and I don't think it worked this effectively.

I had to take 650mg of acetaminophen and a pill my doctor prescribed me for abdominal pain just to make the discomfort more manageable-and it’s still so hard on my insides. It’s been two days now and the pain has only gotten worse. It’s always a mixed bag, sometimes I’ll take it and I’ll feel great!

It ended up taking 3 months combined with Pranicura which you can buy online. Works very well. (Make sure you apply to inner rim of anal canal. Don’t apply internally).

Decided to give miralax a try after my brother who also had chronic constipation recommended it to me.I took it after a meal before bedtime and I noticed my stomach was gurgling but no real discomfort, I think I could feel the stuff moving everything through the colon. Woke up this morning and after drinking some more water, I was able to finally have a bowel movement that was firm yet soft and not watery whatsoever. Finally relief! I'd also like to note that I usually strain really hard to have a bm but with miralax all I had to do was relax and it came right out. Would definitely recommend!",Shelly
