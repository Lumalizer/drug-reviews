BIGGEST and STUPIDEST MISTAKE EVER. It was the 2nd last day of our beach holiday and I was feeling pretty back from all the food consumed so I popped 2 of the pills around 3pm. I went to the toilet around 5pm and thought that was it. Now I know that was just my normal bowel movement because the next morning around 6.30am I woke up with a terrible twisted and bloated stomach ache which preceded with me sitting over the toilet bowl for the next hour writhing in excruciating pain. I felt nausea, cold and dripping in cold sweat. The poop eventually turn into diarrhoea with a bad stench towards the end. Luckily we were headed home so it didn’t completely ruin our trip. Worst experience of my like. I usually take a bowel bulking solution like Dufalac and it’s gentle and works well for me. You might like to consult your doctor about this solution. I’ll stick to it from now on.",JoJoYeoo
1,Bisacodyl,Constipation,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 26, 2022",0,"Dulcolax (bisacodyl):I just want to share my experience, it's my second time trying out dulcolax, I remember the first time I used it was year 2017 when I couldn't poop after I gave birth due to the trauma, it was a week of not pooping and when I took it I just waited for at least 2-3 hours and it worked. Only took 1 pill and it works well easily, no diarrhea, no cramps, just plain BM. Now, March 2022, I am having abdominal pain on my left lower side, thinking it might be gas or constipation so I once again took Dulcolax, first pill at 1:30pm, then had BM around 3:30pm, and I also take a second pill 8hrs after the other which was around 9:30pm, wherein I woke up at 6 am with my tummy rumbling and a little cramps, got in the toilet and right there it's like waterfalls, spent about 5mins in the toilet to finish it all, after that I'm all good. Guess we all have different experiences, but my advice would to take it slower, 1 pill at a time, give it some time to process, do not rush taking dulcolax.",Zelle

And this time I should have known better.  I pretty much had the same experience as everyone else on here.  Missed a day of work (won’t get paid for that) and had to lie because I could not say that I had gone from not pooping in over a week to having explosive diarrhea and severe cramping that was horrible enough to make me have suicidal ideation.  Literally I thought to myself If I have to live to like this I will surely end my life; burning in hell for all of eternity will be a relief compared to this pain and agony.  And my stupid self went and took it again because I was so afraid of getting as backed as the first time.  I was right in that it wasn’t as severe but it was still awful and I will never again take Dulcolax unless I already have a death wish and am suicidal and masochistic simultaneously,NeverAgain

There are many reviews about the pill, so my review is about the suppository. They're kinda gross, but they do the job. The effects come and go much more quickly and predictably than they do with the pill. Usually, they'll work within about 30 minutes and I'll be back to my normal life within about four hours.

Few months later (last night) I decided to take one since I’ve been constipated and bloated for 3 days . WRONG. I couldn’t even sleep from the amount of gurgling I felt in my stomach all night.

Had a soft bowel movement but nothing too bad. Stomach cramps were there but manageable after the constipation pain. Midday I have had to get back in to bed again as fell exhausted but needed the toilet. This time it was very very watery and stung like anything.

Lots of puking and going from couch to floor to try and get comfortable. I got my partner to call the ambulance, as I was convinced I'd ruptured an organ or something ridiculous.The pain subsided and I called the ambo off and went to sleep, woke up 4am and my butt was a literal tap, no more cramps though!

I go to the toilet, little pressure then a normal bowel movement.

Last visit to the now stinky bathroom and it runs out of me like a waterfall. Off back to bed. I get up 1-2 hr later feeling great as I am no longer constipated, swollen and uncomfortable. Next lesson I learnt was not to eat and drink straight away or its nearest loo in quickest time or its a change of knickers. I wait a bit, and then have a small drink, will still go back to the loo.

No cramps, no near death experiences and now after another 12 hours had another minimal movement.

If you just have a one-off constipation I’d recommend using the suppositories instead, as these will allow bowel movement quickly without any pain. But obviously these won’t allow you to empty ‘everything’ if you suffer from non-stop constipation like me.Alternatively give movicol a go - it did nothing for me personally though.",Joey

The dose is 1 - 2 tablets so I just took one of the little darlings before bed. Woke up at 3am with stomach cramps and feeling nauseous. Went quickly to the toilet where the sound of trumpets belted from my backside followed by a motherload of explosive diarrhoea! I was sweating profusely and seeing stars so I dramatically fell onto  the tiled floor to get cool whilst trying not to pass out! More cramps and nausea ensued and I dragged myself back onto the pot to more squeaks and squelchy farts. This went back and forth with intermittent diarrhoea for hours and alternating between boiling hot and freezing cold. I’m sure my butt has turned inside out!

94,Bisacodyl,Constipation,10.0,,"August 7, 2021",0,Dulcolax (bisacodyl):Have been dealing with chronic constipation for years due to  a disability. This med really works for me-maybe I am just lucky-I am sorry to hear so many of you have had horrible experiences. I take a few once or twice a week-to get pooping that often for me these days is a real improvement and I need to be sure I co-ordinate my proximity to the loo and a carer hence the timing of my regime.  The cramps do happen but I can tolerate them.I get a bit of a fever feeling but that is short lived.  What I do on my poo pill nights is take them late in the evening as they take a good few hours to work on me - say about 10 hours but that is due to my system being slowed down by disability. That gives me some hours when it is safe to get some shut eye and sort myself out to get to the toilet the next day. The initial evacuation may sometimes be a bit of a struggle but from there on in my bowel is pretty much cleared after about three or so trips to loo. Hope sharing this info helps.,Tess

The extreme pain is a common trend and it’s horrific but you’ll be okay. So I took this for the first time recently, the dosage being 2 pills. I drank barely any water with it, went to bed and woke up in the worst abdominal pain I’ve ever felt, sweating and couldn’t move. Lasted about 2 hours, came in waves but I had multiple BMs in the hours following, after I was done the pain finally subsided. I thought I would never try it again but it worked so well so I  just needed to find a way to prevent so much pain from happening again. The answer: WATER and LOTS of it. Over 3 glasses at least.

TIPS: 1) Drink lots of water before taking it, otherwise you will get extremely dizzy. 2) Sometimes it may take more than 12 hours to work so, for instance, make sure to take it around 7-8 at night if you want to be finished before 12 in the morning. 3) Speak to your doctor and make sure there are NO other options for you before you use it.

I had first bowel movement at 6 am and from then until now at least 10 bowel movements which is like pure water coming out. I felt so weak earlier.

I’ve taken this drug a few times. First two times I had mild constipation and shared the same experience as most of you on here have had. Horrible cramping, sweats, explosive bowel movements, laying on the floor and overall just wanting lfe to be over! The next two times I had taken it I honestly swore I’d never take this drug again but this time my blockage had lasted over a week. That feeling alone is scary think that your intestines will explode. So I took each time right before bed. Woke up early in the morning with cramping but immediately released in the toilet. Diarrhea for the next few hours but tolerable. So to conclude this is a great product for severe constipation, I’m not talking a 3-4 days without a bowel movement, I’m talking a week or longer. Try other outlets like collace or Metamucil. Ducolax should be a last resort after a long period without. Hope that helps someone :)",P-man

On the Bristol Stool chart (that is a chart the doctors use to classify your poo), I’ll often have type 1 stools which are like passing rocks out of your butt and take an eternity while tearing your rectum apart. So I took 4 duclolax pills and over the course of the day, things improved, but I did feel some nausea and I had 4 BMs. So it will definitely make you poop. I normally drink coffee in the morning and then just go every morning once. On Dulcolax, as I wrote, I went 4 times  in 1 day, but it did change the stool shape positively. On the Bristol chart I probably ended up at type 3 (normal) by the evening so I generally think it’s a good product if you suffer from pooping rocks like I do.

By 12:50pm I was in agony, slumped on the toilet with sweat dripping down my face. I had the shakes and was genuinely very close to dialling 999. Nothing came out after 10 minutes or so, so I went to leave the bathroom just so my colleagues knew I was still alive. As soon as I stood up, it felt like a volcano had just erupted in my bowels. The contractions willed the hard stool and what felt like tap water straight out of me. I was just a mere passenger. I have been to the toilet twice since and it is still the consistency of water. At the end of the day, it worked exactly as it should. Just be patient.",Naomi

After that I had diarrhea. After breakfast, I stayed in for a while because I was afraid I would leave a trail of poo on the beach. Nothing happened.  Later that day, I did have another episode of diarrhea when I went to the bathroom but no other symptoms. So, this stuff works but it isn’t pretty. Try other alternatives first, like suppositories.",Eive

Because I take diuretics medication it is very hard for me to produce a BM, leaving me constipated for days. After my doctor had prescribe me plenty of other stool softener that did not work.

I reported that to my Dr and he advised that I drink a 8oz of water. The next dosage I took it at 8pm after dinner with a tall glass of water. No stomach pain and once I woke up I immediately went to have a BM. Bisacodyl has been a good experience for me and I haven't had any of the side affect that were mention in this thread.

To everyone who are complaining this tablet doesn't work you should know that the tablet should be consumed if you are suffering from constipation for more than 2 days. Try natural methods such as eating more fibre and drinking more water first or have psyllium husk. If all fails then take the tablet. It will surely work with sufficient water.Also take only one at a time don't go about taking 2 or 3 tablets at once, even if the package says it.

I went once, had no diarrhea, fully formed, very slight seconds-long gas pain. Done.

Do not over-exert yourself, the pill will work. Within 25min I had my first BM that was the bulk of my constipation. RELIEF.2. DRINK PLENTY OF WATER.

In the morning I need to go!! I agree with others though that it can cause diarrhea like poop. It seems my poop starts normal at first, but then it turns to diarrhea.

Only take when completely necessary, if tAken when not needed the pain will be 10 times worse, 2. drink lots of water when taking and 3. when the pain comes to lay on my back rather than on my side, not sure why but it seems to full the pain.

I thought I would get on here though, because those negative side effects do NOT happen to everyone! I do have to say though, I am So GLAD I didn't take it before bedtime (like suggested on the box though) because that would have put me up 2:30 AM in the morning, when everything got flushed out). That wouldn't have made me a happy camper, Glad I decide to take it after lunch, and then I was home at 4:30 after work, and went to the bathroom, and it Truly does CLEAN you OUT!! My advice, be smart with the timing and place you take this medicine, if you decide to try it.",Workoutlover
