I had eaten a lot of food that day and still didn’t have a bowel movement so I took one of the laxatives, and went to bed. I woke up the next morning with awful stomach cramps and I didn’t know if it was from my period or from the senokot so I went to use the bathroom and everything came out, after that the stomach cramps stopped. It’s now 11:15 am and my stomach is just a tiny bit uncomfortable. I think it’s because I didn’t get EVERYTHING out yet. But I didn’t have a terrible experience with it. I probably won’t use again incase I get more of the other terrible side effects that I am terrified of.",Senokot

2,Senna,Constipation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 26, 2022",0,"The last time I had a bowel movement was 9 days ago, then two days after that movement I took myself to hospital as I felt my innards were about to explode.  I was sent home in agony to let 'nature take its course'! (Virus...of course) Didn't eat for days, then the wife bought me these, which I took two of last night and 15 hours later into today - FINALLY!!! I emptied what seems to be a blocked colon. These gave me no pain while I've been in agony blocked without them. Don't understand why others had issues.  I did drink lots of water first...you not only want to be fully hydrated before taking these, but you want to be hydrated beyond this to take into account the effects of senna.",Andy B

5,Senna,Constipation,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2022",0,"After taking Senna for constipation, the next evening I started having cramps. Then the cramps worsened (scale of 1-10, pain was a 9). My stomach was making gurgling noises, so I tried to sleep it off. However, the cramps were so bad, they were waking me up every 2-3 minutes. About 2am, I felt very cold and started shaking and realized that I had the chills. I made my way to the bathroom, so I could take a hot shower and bring my body temperature back up but then I started to feel nauseous.  I was heaving and gagging, but didn't have any food in my system.  Then I got the chills the 2nd day again. I sat out in the sun to warm myself up but I started gagging and throwing up outside. It's been 3 days and I still feel slight cramping and I'm still not 100%. Sometimes I feel like I have a slight fever and my stomach is still  extended. NEVER AGAIN...",Smooth Move
6,Senna,Constipation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 28, 2022",0,Senokot (senna):Took one pill before bed at around 9pm. At around 3-4am (I can’t tell you the exact time as I blacked out) I got extreme sharp pains in my lower abdomen that lasted until around 8am. The first sharp pains I got up to take some paracetamol but ended up passing out and woke up on the floor with a nice lump to the back of my head which I had hit on the radiator on the way down. No idea how long I was out for but felt sick when I woke up so tried to get to the bathroom. Next thing I remember was being on the bathroom floor so must have passed out again. Pain was excruciating and spent the rest of the night on the bathroom floor. If my husband had been home I would have gone to the hospital it was that bad- would have been a little embarrassing but after loosing consciousness probably would have been a good idea. Wasn’t able to get to my phone to ring for help either. Would give this one star as I did manage to go to the toilet at around 11am the following day.,Unhappy

Well this past week I could not get any relief. I tried miralax, flaxseed, Metamucil, fleet glycerin suppositories and liquid suppositories to no avail. I have take dulecolax in the past and it has always woken me up on the 6hr mark in screaming pain. It feels like a drank lava. I can feel myself about to faint because of the pain. So I decided I needed to try a senna lax and OH MY GOD. I was in a panic last night thinking about my terrible experience and waiting for the cramps to set in. While I did cramp, it’s been wayyy less brutal and I actually had a normal bm this morning. I will definitely be taking this again if I ever need some extra assistance. Please don’t use this product long term as your body can become dependent. Now if this product made you feel absolutely terrible I suggest trying the dulcolax.

I took one tablet last night as I was quite badly constipated and I regret it SO much. I have had a terrible sleep, with horrible abdominal pains (equivalent to my bad period cramps), cold shakes and lightheadedness - I went to the bathroom when I could finally bare to move and I am somehow more constipated than before - so bad that I actually collapsed/passed-out on the toilet and have cut/bruised my eye. I am so so scared as I’m only young and alone at Uni at the moment and I genuinely feel like I may die the pain is that bad.Please, I suffer from constipation often, and I would rather be constipated all those times than take this again.

Shortly after taking it, I was in a serious condition, doubled over in pain much worse than labour pain, I thought I was going to die. I screamed with the pain of each contraction. This went on all night and for several hours after.  I was in a cold sweat and sat on the toilet screaming all night. I did not want my young daughter to be frightened, so kept the door shut and used the toilet downstairs.  I felt completely exhausted and wrecked for days afterwards as if had been through a babies labour. I wanted to call an ambulance but was in too much pain to move from the toilet. I have never experienced pain like this and have had long labours with 3 babies weighing 10 lbs. This was unbearable and the pain 10 out of 10.  I have not gotten over it, it was terrifying.

14,Senna,Constipation,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 26, 2021",0,"Senokot (senna):I've been on Senokot for about 4 months with no issues. I take two, 8.6mg at 10pm at night and usually at about 11am the next day I either have a brief abdominal pain followed by some gas or brief abdominal pain followed by a bowel movement. Today however is different. Today I woke up with that pain at around 9:30am and it was severe. At about 11:40am it got so bad I puked up all my liquids then it quieted down for a bit. It's now 1pm and I still get quite extreme cramps although less frequent and I still haven't been able to pass gas, let alone a BM. It's 3:40pm now and I feel like I might be okay, I haven't had a cramp in about an hour. I found a way to lie down in my bed where I wasn't cramping as much and that seemed to put me on the right track. For the love of God though, be warned. I've dislocated my shoulder, broken ribs, my back, elbow, chest plate, I've even gone through heroin/fentanyl withdrawal and those Senokot side effects was the worst thing I've been through.",sublocade user

17,Senna,Constipation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 10, 2021",0,I was given Senna to take after surgery in case I was constipated after. I took it two days later and was fine all day. Went to bed. Woke up with SEVERE CRAMPS went to the bathroom and the cramps were so bad I was in tears! Started throwing up the greens stuff from the Senna. Did that like 3 different times threw out the night. I was in pain with cramps until the next morning I had my husband go get a Fleet enema. But before he got back so I could use it. All heck broke loose and still had the cramp although not as bad until the next night. Place be careful before considering the Senna.,Teresa

I can't comment on constipation in general but for OIC Senakot worked perfectly for me. Took 2 tablets at night and another 2 in the morning.

22,Senna,Constipation,5.0,,"November 2, 2021",3,"Senokot (senna):I've taken Senokot before and it usually works. This one time though, I had SEVERE side effects. Bad stomach cramping, grumbling, shooting pains, going to the bathroom every 7-10 minutes, burping like crazy, weak and nauseous, chest pains (what I imagined having a heart attack feels like), and watery stools. I've never experienced anything this bad before. I've never had a baby before but I imagined this to be worse than labour pains, minus the giving birth part. I had so many things planned for the day but I spent it curled up in a ball. The second day was better, less frequent bathroom breaks, but when I ate something, it started again. I honestly considered calling 911. Hopefully the third day is better. I'd give it a five for the side effects. I've only taken two this time, before I used to take four and nothing like this happened before. Take with caution, seriously.",Grace
23,Senna,Constipation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2021",2,Senokot (senna):The first time I took senokot it made me have a bowel movement within an hour but was ok. The second time I took one all hell broke loose. I don't know if having IBS plays a part in it but I get severely constipated and don't have bowel movements for up to a week sometimes but I took the senokot and once again within an hour I was on the toilet. I had a bowel movement. And then another. And another. In total 10 times since I've taken the pill over the course of the day. I have felt lightheaded all day and feel as though I am going to pass out every time I make my way to the toilet. I have barely eaten anything today just because my stomach is bothering me so much. Now trying to sleep but paranoid that I might end up needing to go for another bowel movement soon as my stomach is making some crazy noises. I would rather be constipated the side effects are not worth it I have been lying in bed all day unable to do anything at least when I am constipated I can still go on with my day to day,Flowerpickle

27,Senna,Constipation,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 6, 2021",0,"All guts are not created equal. Some of us can tolerate Senna well and others really cannot. Perhaps a pre-existing low level of inflammation in the gut + senna = the worst pain imaginable. The kind where you are overheating but cooling down from the vast amount of endorphins your body is producing just to get you though it, gooseflesh, and nightmare cramps. That's how it is for me. Best to experiment with low doses first just to see what your guts think of it before going the full monty. Some folks have almost no pain. You won't know until you try lol. It was highly effective in cleaning out my gut but I will never take it again, the pain was ridiculous, for me, personally.",Anna

I took one tablet after not having a bowel movement in around 4 days and 6 hours later got the worst diarrhea I've ever had in my life, think liquid, explosive and painful. It happened on and off for a few hours and was terrible because I had just had surgery and was not the most mobile. I also had unbearable abdominal cramping to the point of nausea.

I have IBS, so I’m careful to only take one Senokot. I’ve been dealing with fecal impaction for a while, and there have been times the Senokot didn’t do much besides give me stomach cramps. I may not have taken enough. The strange thing is, about 3 oclock yesterday I took a single 25 mg pill (half the recommended dose of Sennosides) and by nighttime I had a successful bowel movement, but to my dismay, the movements didn’t stop. Now I’m having watery diarrhea, with incontinence. The stomach cramps are gone, but over 32 hours later I’m still dealing with soiling. I’m not sure why. I imagine it will stop soon, but I’ll be reluctant to ever try it again with my IBS. One good thing I can say is that it definitely worked.

Third night I decided to only take one. Up all night in the bathroom with intense pain. Felt like I needed to go but couldn't. Leaned forward using the counter and giggled my belly by bouncing my knees. After an hour explosive diarrhea came. Lasted most of the day and the pain continued off and on, awful, debilitating. It's now a week later and I'm still having bouts off pain. Kept me up all night last night and this time there was severe nausea along with dry heaves, sweating.

39,Senna,Constipation,,,"July 19, 2021",3,Senokot (senna):I actually would recommend this product when you feel uncomfortably bloated. I took/take one tablet at night if I feel the need with a mixed herbal tea. The next morning you do need a bowel movement and you do get some cramping but if you don’t take more than you need it’s bearable and relieving. Heed the warnings though if you think you might not tolerate this or you’re tempted to take more than you should - DON’T. You will be on the loo on and off with severe stomach cramping for hours and hours. I took 2 one night and I could barely walk around town the next day I was in so much pain with my stomach and feeling sick.

By 10pm I was having trouble. After taking one, I noticed a few dizzy spells then overall weakness. It escalated to difficultly breathing like an elephant was on my chest and intense gas. My heart was pounding, got extremely anxious and I began vomiting until I had broken blood vessels around my eyes. I took a half dose of Zertec which helped for a bit, then another half when it started again. Finally got some sleep after 3:30am and woke up still feeling under the weather with swollen eyes.

I'm shocked at some peoples comments saying they have taken several tablets and it made them feel ill or bad cramps, it's no surprise to feel like that if you take more than it tells you to take.  Also it is quite normal to have a very liquid stool as this is caused by a hard stool blocking the way and the liquid stool forces its way past and you will then need to go again soon after as the rest then finds it easier.
