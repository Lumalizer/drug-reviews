0,Linzess,Constipation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 10, 2022",0,"Have been constipated for 5 days. Started to feel sick to my stomach and nauseous from the backlog so I decided last night around 9pm to take one of the Linzess pills. (My doctor prescribed them over 2 months ago but after reading the reviews, I’ve been hesitant to take them. I reached a breaking point last night and said the heck with it- I’m taking one.) Around 11, just a few hours later, I could feel something happening and headed to the loo. It was uncomfortable getting all the old stuff out with the pressure building up behind the jam but it finally cleared…and then the real fun started. Ya ever done a prep for a colonoscopy before? This doesn’t feel any different: watery stool that just comes out. It’s now 6am and I’ve been up all night running back and forth to the toilet.  Even though I’m exhausted, and I don’t think the experience is over yet, I feel so much better. I will save Linzess for last ditch effort.",Susan
1,Linzess,Constipation,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 28, 2022",0,"I took the 146 mcg and it saved me from being impacted.  I couldn’t go on my own. I took it three times a week and wasn’t mad about the price as it wasn’t covered by insurance and was $1 a pill I would get qty 30. Was worth every penny after 3 refills was up. Sad when I go to my Dr last week at Kaiser and hear no longer available. Only pill that worked and this new stuff I have doesn’t work, was $10 bucks for 60. Bring back LINZESS!!!!",M. Gibbs-Clark

4,Linzess,Constipation,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 13, 2021",0,Used Linzess before and it worked great. Went on it a little over a week ago. It took seven days to start working but again is working great. No diarrhea just soft normal stools. Only concern is the cost and not having drug coverage. Hoping to be approved for patient assistance program as I was in the past. I am taking 290. It is great to know I have something that is helping me so much. Highly recommend,Happy Camper
5,Linzess,Constipation,4.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 5, 2021",0,"Linzess is a very expensive drug that works great when it works. Honestly, it doesn’t work consistently based on the directions. It will work great-meaning will let you be able to go-in the beginning. Then for zero reasons, meaning no changes to what you are doing, what other meds you are taking, how much liquid you are drinking, not skipping any days, or how much exercise you are doing. Really without making any changes to your daily life from one day to the next the drug just stops working. It would be one thing if this drug didn’t cost more than a car payment each month. But it does. I also can tell you that yes they have coupons. But not for anyone on Medicare. Add to that sometimes the cost will even vary if you have Medicare part D. I don’t qualify for coupons even though I am on disability. I don’t make much money at all but I do have a 401k. For that reason I don’t qualify for other government help. It’s actually criminal just because I have a 401k (retirement plan).",Veggydog5
6,Linzess,Constipation,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 27, 2021",1,I started out taking a sample linzess middle range dosage I was good at first and they had me on the toilet and I couldn't get up I was there putting everything that seems like water water water I called my gastroenterologist and told him there was no way. And she said stop taking it it's just a sample I'll talk to the doctor and see what we can do. She told me I wasn't taking the highest dosage or the lowest dosage. She said there's a lower dose if I'm willing to try that. I told her at that moment what I had was really bad diarrhea giving me a stuffy nose and the sneezes and I mean had a stuffy nose before I start taking this medicine I can handle the stuffy nose the snitch because I'm an allergy sufferer so it's okay for me to cough. The doctor then approved a sample for me to try of the lower dosage. I'm still getting a runny nose and sneezing a lot. This is much better in my opinion going to the bathroom like you have Niagara Falls coming out your tushy.,Amie
7,Linzess,Constipation,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 25, 2021",0,Omg I started to take it every morning before my meal and then the gas set in with incredible heartburn and bloat like I was nine months pregnant!!! Absolutely horrible side effects!!!,Shelly
8,Linzess,Constipation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 9, 2021",2,"So I had a gastritis flare up and for some reason I got constipated this time with it. Maybe the bland foods I was eating honestly I’m not sure. It had never caused that in the past. I tried everything to unclog. Finally the ER recommendation magnesium citrate.  They told me it wouldn’t affect the lining of my stomach and that was a complete lie! I got a referral to GI that recommended Linzess. I was freaking out worried that it wouldn’t work or that it would mess up my stomach that was finally healing. I had horrible anxiety the whole day before deciding to finally take it. 6 pm I pop the pill. Drink 3 glasses of warm water...warm because cold hurts during a gastritis flare up. After an hour I felt some movement,some gas. Another hour goes by and I walk in a like magic I produce poop! Like hallelujah!!! No weird rumbling like the magnesium gave me. Just almost instant relief. Would definitely recommend this to others.",Rebecca

I was worried at first, however after about three weeks for my body to adjust to the change it works great.  I love it.  Only down side is that sometimes it continues to work several times so you have to plan your day accordingly.  However, I highly recommend the product.",happypatient

14,Linzess,Constipation,10.0,,"August 9, 2021",3,I quit smoking cigs a year ago. It was a  laxative effect for me so when I stop the cigarettes I suffered constipation for a year. I was only going once a week and mentally I would think of everything I ate and I would start to stress that it was still just sitting in there and jealous of the people that can go daily. I got on linzness and wished I knew about it a year ago. It’s amazing I don’t care if it is sometimes watery it’s still coming out.. from a year of sitting on the toilet and only pushing out pebbles or hours on the toilet birthing out watermelons this pill is a life saver. Is it answering my questions to what is wrong with me that I have to take this? No! But it has made me happier. My side effect is runny and stuffy nose. Hope this passes. I would rather have cold symptoms than 17 meals sitting inside me for a week. I think it works best on empty stomach 30 minutes before you eat solid foods. You have to eat a sandwich or pizza. Don’t take it and eat a cracker. It works with substance. I love it,Elle

Watery diarrhea, feels like I'm peeing out of my rear. This last one, I got sick feeling and lightheaded. Likely because it draws all the water out of your body and into your bowels.

I would have to take stool softeners/laxatives every day, still sometimes it would be days before I would go. My new Primary Care Dr after the first mention of this issue suggested I try Linzess, I have been taking it for 1 month now. I Love It! I take it as soon as y’all feet hit the floor every morning, I wait at least 30 minutes before I have my coffee, and within 1 to 1 1/2 hr after taking it I am going. Complete emptying, some more complete than others. But I Have NEVER gone every day, Never!

27,Linzess,Constipation,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 9, 2020",13,Linzess worked for maybe two days. This drug is a crock and expensive to boot.  Best remedy is to find a good and natural routine e.g . Flavored Seltzer water and 7 prunes twice a day every day. It works like nothing else tried...OTC stool softener...etc.  Linzess was a total waste of money and stomach pain.,A
28,Linzess,Constipation,10.0,,"April 22, 2020",18,"28 years old and have been fighting IBS type C for 7 years (so far). I had a bad bout of the stomach flu on March 6th 2020, and it seems like I am still dealing with the post infectious IBS part of it. My doctor put me on Linzess, it hardened my softer green stools to where they come out more formed instead of little rabbit turds, or slighly long narrow/ribbon shaped. I feel the diarrhea part might start soon, so I'm keeping my mind open to it. Instead of taking it at night before bed, I will switch to when I wake up. My main issue now is yellow foul smelling stools, my doctor wants to do an upper endoscopy and colonoscopy this year sometime, but unfortunately with COVID still going on I have to wait.",Nikki

Once after my C-Section, the pain meds blocked me up a lot. And then I just took it again today. My doctor thinks I need my gallbladder removed so I was given medication to help until COVID-19 is over and I can go for testing. The meds he proscribed made me extremely constipated. Normally I can drink a cup of coffee or apple juice and be just fine but that hasn’t been the case the past few days so I took one 290 mg linzess and I now have horrible diarrhea. It worked to say the least. I’m honestly scared to even sleep right now that’s how bad it is. I’m still having stomach cramps around my gallbladder area. But it is working for constipation.",Sonic

The doctor gave me the 72 mcg Iinzess capsule and it worked within two hours. It relieve the bloated feeling I had since my surgery. I wouldn’t take this long term though as it does seem to cause diarrhea. It cleans you out very well. But I needed that.

By 6:30 pm my stomach was gurgling and rolling and by 7 pm I was on the toilet with explosive diarrhea. Everything but the kitchen sink came out of me. And let me tell you it felt great to get cleaned out. My stomach did not hurt. No cramping. Just lots of bathroom trips. Be sure to be at home when you take it. You'll go A LOT.

The drug didn't seem to work at all the first week, with no noticeable changes in my bowel movements. However, about 8 days into the Linzess, I had INCREDIBLY bad, spontaneous diarrhea for an entire day. The same diarrhea occurred the following 2 days with stomach cramps and the worst pain I have ever felt in my life coming from my rectum. I was told to immediately stop taking the Linzess, but days followed with bad abdomen cramps about every 15 minutes and 'pounding' in my upper intestinal track.

42,Linzess,Constipation,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 13, 2019",10,I’ve been dealing with severe IBS-C for a couple of years now and never been able to find a solution for my constipation. I’ve been taking linzess for about 3 weeks now and it definitely makes me use the bathroom on the lowest dose. only reason I didn’t give 10 stars is because it isn’t consistent (I can take linzess consistently but don’t always go consistently) and I feel like it enhances bloating and gas. Over all I love linzess and I don’t mind dealing with some bloating and gas if I can use the bathroom.,Makayla
43,Linzess,Constipation,7.0,,"August 10, 2019",7,"Linzess stopped working when I had to begin taking an RX for my thyroid. So, I continued taking Linzess,  but supplemented (at the same time)  with an OTC laxative, thirty minutes before breakfast.  I do this every two days.  If I don’t, diverticulitis will send me to the ER.   I do know that laxatives cause Melanosis Coli but, at this point, I have no choice. The Linzess helps the laxative work faster and with minimal pain.  Laxatives alone do not work for me.  I schedule my meds and have to set aside the entire day, because, sometimes, that’s how long it takes. Having suffered with IBS, chronic constipation and a few episodes of diverticulitis for such a long time, this is my life:  manageable but not miserable.  It is inconvenient but fortunately, I’m retired.  Without my Linzess  regimen, I probably wouldn’t be here today.",Jill

It’s amazing to me, is that if I try to take 145mg, it won’t work at all. But 290mg, is almost to much. I take it with 16oz of water, and usually coffee as well, to really get things going. Seriously need to be by a bathroom when it kicks in, it’s with almost no warning. Some warning growls from the gut is all you get. One thing I have realized it’s 2 1/2 hours to 3 hours every time. So I usually take it around 3:30am, and I’m going to work by 7:30. It stops as quickly as it starts. **i want to address the weight gain. It’s important to me, I’ve lost 95lbs on keto. I gained 5lbs, which sucks, but I stop taking it for 3 days, it comes right back off. It’s water people. This medicine adds water to your stool to make it passable.

I decided to try taking it before bed instead and it's been so much better! I now have a bowel movement about 30 mins after I wake up and none of the side effects. I also highly recommend taking it for several weeks before you give up because it takes some time to adjust and then I had hardly any side effects.

I have been on it for almost a week and today the diarrhea is gone. I notice that after I eat a meal, I get really bloated. I guess I need to give this medicine more time. I do hope this is my answer!",Conni
115,Linzess,Constipation,10.0,,"February 28, 2013",68,"Linzess has been wonderful for me. I developed a bad fissure and the over the counter options weren't working unless I didn't need to leave the house. With Linzess, I take it at 530, consume something at 600, and about 730 I'm finding relief. For me, it takes only 2 times, 15 minutes apart to feel empty, and then I'm okay the rest of the day usually. I've been able to tailor these bathroom trips around my schedule, and my fissure is finally healed without surgery.  I haven't had any side effects as the watery stools I greatly appreciate. I love this stuff.",tattooedmomma
