1,Fluocinonide,Lichen Planus,10,,"January 17, 2013",50,"I had a severe case of erosive Lichen Planus on the inside of my cheek and gum surfaces, painful and increasing in area affected by the day.  This was the second steroid prescribed, the first was an oral rinse used 4-6 times per day.  When no result was seen my oral surgeon prescribed fluocinonide get used 3-4 times daily.  The lesions responded almost immediately to the treatment and after two weeks my mouth is healed and pain fee.  I am using the gel once per day as a maintenance and go back to the doctor next week.",Fionasmom
