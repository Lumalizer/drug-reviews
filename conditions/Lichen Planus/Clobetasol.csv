0,Clobetasol,Lichen Planus,4,,"February 6, 2022",1,I noticed one reviewer said this medicine exacerbated her Lichen Planus I believe this is what's happening to me. Been on it a week and my oral sores are worse then when I started. Beyond painful,Snookie

2,Clobetasol,Lichen Planus,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 22, 2021",0,"I got lichen planus starting this summer season. Biopsy confirmed. I take 2 different blood pressure meds. One a beta-blocker which I read can cause this. Dermatologist says he has a pill for this. I was supposed to get off the bp meds and I did for about 2 weeks per med. He says 8 weeks off bp meds. Mom died of a stroke in the ‘90s. So I’m trying again going off metoprolol for 8 weeks. So, I didn’t get the pill cause I’m still on bp meds. He asked me about coming back, I told him no, I’ll try again for 8 weeks without bp meds. Metoprolol is an added med for my main blood pressure med and it does help. So I risk a stroke to try to rid myself of this stuff. Clobetasol 15g tube lasted one week, no help, Fluocinolone no help. Used creams about a month. Going to try Emuaid max. strength. I did get off my cholesterol med. That did help for the itching, which isn’t as intense as it used to be. CeraVe itch jar cream helps too.",Itchy me
3,Clobetasol,Lichen Planus,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 17, 2021",0,"Having tried betamethasone and triamcinolone for lichen planus, I have found that neither work as well as clobetasol, which is of course far more expensive.",Anonymous
4,Clobetasol,Lichen Planus,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 10, 2021",1,"This stuff (Clobetasol) is absolutely worthless for my condition, for one thing the dosage 0.05 is not strong enough, and my dermatologist claims that she can't get it any higher, but that is not what the Internet states. I'll give her one more chance to find something that works for, or I'm OUT!!! There are several more drugs that are available.  I give Clobetasol a big fat ""0"".  I've been suffering with this rubbish for almost two years.",tylit43

6,Clobetasol,Lichen Planus,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 18, 2020",3,I've been diagnosed with this Lichen Planus for The last two years. The topical cream Clobetasol helped  for the first 3-6 months making it go away. It seemed the summer  weather or hot areas triggers it -so it came back. It's awful to have this and not able to find the cure...  I still use Clobetasol but it does not help much!,Mimi
7,Clobetasol,Lichen Planus,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 29, 2020",4,I used Clobetasol and it exacerbated my Lichen Planus.  It made it so bad that I ended up with an infection and had to have surgery to clean out the wound.,Grubbsg
8,Clobetasol,Lichen Planus,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 2, 2019",9,I have had lichen planus for over 12 years. It comes and goes. This ointment works fast and well to treat them so they clear up.  It takes about 7-10 days to completely resolve but I see results in a couple of days.,OK
9,Clobetasol,Lichen Planus,10,,"April 3, 2015",12,"I was prescribed and tried Triamcinolone Acetonide for several weeks which had little effect.  I had a previous bout of Alopecia Areata and still had a little Clobex left.  After reading a lot of information and just a couple days before my next appointment I tried a little on a few of the spots on my arm and they immediately started to look better.  The PA that was treating me was impressed enough to give me a box of OLUX-E foam samples to try and the clearing effect was immediate, showing major improvement in just days.",Joshua Tree
