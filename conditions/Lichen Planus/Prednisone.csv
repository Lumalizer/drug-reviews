0,Prednisone,Lichen Planus,8,,"November 19, 2020",3,"I’ve had lichen Planus since the age of 15. I would have off and on breakouts, however for the past 10 years or so, it has been relentless. I have lesions all over my body and in my mouth. My entire body is scarred from the lesions. Prednisone worked for me, but after coming off the medication, the lesions would return worse than before. Prednisone works, but the potential side effects don’t allow for long term use. It is a miracle drug but the side effects wreak havoc on other parts of your body!",Fox
1,Prednisone,Lichen Planus,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 17, 2018",11,"Prednisone worked great, my doctor gave me a large prescription of 30mg doses to take for 2-3 weeks at a time during my lichen planus outbreaks. Combined with other topical medication my spots disappeared quite quickly as they show up on my genitals. You can imagine how terrifying and anxious this can make you. Couldn't have been more happy with my results.",Patient

3,Prednisone,Lichen Planus,8,,"September 1, 2016",5,"I took prednisone twice for my lichen planus. the 1st time it worked great, a lot of my plaque areas cleared up and went away, however anytime I was experiencing stress, a change in other medications, anxiety ect, I broke out in new sites. The 2nd time I took prednisone I experienced severe side effects. It caused a perforation in my bowel, stomach and lower intestine. I also got a abscess under my liver that had to be tubed. I spent 6 days in the hospital and was  given a PIC line for administration of IV antibiotic Zosyn every 6 hrs for 30 days after release from the hospital. (that then gave me c difficile, not once but TWICE.) It did help with my lichen planus, but the side effects for me greatly outweighed its successes.",Stephany K
4,Prednisone,Lichen Planus,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 10, 2016",5,"I'm a 37 years old and I have had ""heat rash"" since I was a young child. My body is usually covered in bumps from spring to fall. I have been prescribed lotions and steroid creams which usually just helps with the itching. Since there was a warm weather I started breaking out in December and because of travel to hot places my body was covered in bumps by February. So in May I saw a new dermatologist, she did a biopsy for lichen planus and placed me on prednisone. I took a 20 day dose and within a few days the texture and size change. Also some disappeared and there was no more irritation. I've been off prednisone for 2 weeks now and I've have started to breakout and the irritation has started back.",VJen
