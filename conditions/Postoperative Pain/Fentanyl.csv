1,Fentanyl,Postoperative Pain,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 3, 2018",6,"Had this for pain for a minor surgical procedure and for some pain afterwards and it's great stuff! I metabolize meds quickly, but this stuff took my 5 on a pain scale to a 2 in about a minute and lasted for 6 hours.  Definitely would get again if I ever have to have a surgical procedure. Also had it during the operation with Propofol. No nausea either from the anti-nausea meds. Worked great.",N/A
2,Fentanyl,Postoperative Pain,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 6, 2015",5,"I got this drug post surgery twice and it had little to effect on my pain. Unfortunately I had forgotten to mention before the second surgery that it failed to work the first time around. Both times I awoke from surgery in tears and severe pain. Only after convincing them I was awake enough for them to take out the tube in my throat, aka using all my strength and energy to hit the side of the bed and staring straight into the eyes of anyone who came near me, was I able to request a different medication for my pain. Immediately upon switching my pain decreased. May be unique to me as I've also heard very good things from others.",:)
3,Fentanyl,Postoperative Pain,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 19, 2012",13,Sublimaze (fentanyl):I have been given this a lot after surgery. It is great for post surgical pain because it kills the pain but it doesn't give you nausea and constipation like others do.,dieseltruckguy
4,Fentanyl,Postoperative Pain,9,,"January 5, 2009",1,"I had to have 3 shots of it but after that my pain was pretty much gone. I had an alveoplasty (reshaping of the jawbone) done. After 3 shots intravenously my pain was down to a 5/10, which is usually as low as my pain level gets.",nincure
5,Fentanyl,Postoperative Pain,7,,"November 2, 2008",11,"Duragesic (fentanyl):Previously prescribed oxycontin 40mg, new doctor switched me to Duragesic.  For me it's convenient, apply the patch to clean dry skin and leave it alone but Oxycontin 40mg time release is much more effective for my continuous pain but doctors won't prescribe it.",ohiopainsufferer
