They did a pain block which worked great, until the last 4-5 hours. Now they are giving me Toradol with 3 OTC Tylenol.  With the block now wearing off, the Toradol is not working at all. It just doesn’t work on me. I’m in misery.",Glinda E.

6,Ketorolac Tromethamine,Postoperative Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 5, 2019",8,"I just had 4 wisdom teeth removed along with an impacted second molar and was prescribed toradol. I have been amazed to say the least. I was expecting to be in horrible pain. I have about 8 stitches and all I have is sore gums, but that's to be expected. Going on day 2 and haven't had any problems.  I have been prescribed several narcotic pain meds that worked for a short period of time and had to take more. Toradol is a miracle drug and I would definitely recommend it over narcotic pain meds. I haven't had any bad side effects. Idk if people having hallucinations were taking something else with or prior to toradol or just adverse side effects.",Yomommasfoot

13,Ketorolac Tromethamine,Postoperative Pain,3.0,,"May 7, 2018",105,"Toradol (ketorolac):Toradol can be very dangerous and the drug company is trying to make it sound like it is the ""cure all"" for narcotic pain control. Did they tell you that Toradol is like ibuprofen? Did they tell you it can cause ulcers? This is not the drug for pain control. We have morphine and dilaudid, which provide excellent relief without gut bleeds and ulcers, along with blood thinning. All the hospitals are worried about is the opioid crisis (that they created by handing them out like candy), but no one wants to talk about the methamphetamine crisis that is ruining this country. How about dealing with that, and let me give my poor patients some pain relief with morphine or dilaudid.",Lucygirl RN

Prescribed for a week and took it every 6 hours. So effective that I felt no pain at all while taking it and without any side effect. Hydrocodone/acetaminophen was also prescribed for breakthrough pain, however hydrocodone/acetaminophen caused dizziness and vomiting for me so severe after only taking 1 pill that I stopped immediately. Keterolac is a much better and effective option for me personally.",XW

They also gave me Demerol, but I noticed it hardly touched my pain level, while 15 minutes after taking Toradol I would have relief.  When they discharged me they gave me a 3 day prescription of Toradol and a 30 day prescription of hydrocodone.  I asked if I could get more Toradol instead of the hydrocodone and they said no.  Sure enough, once my three days of taking Toradol was up I was back to being in discomfort again.  The hydrocodone hardly did anything and gave me weird dreams.  I ended up tossing it and taking Advil.",TWG74

I found it ineffective both times. I switched to Tylenol extra strength, which is only slightly better for pain, but without the side effects. After spine surgery, I took one Toradol then threw out the bottle and switched, I also used an ice pack throughout the day.The pain after my breast reduction was much more severe, so I gave the Toradol a few days hoping it would work, but it just gave me horrible stomach pain in addition to the pain from surgery.I don't recommend it for severe pain, and will ask for something else in the future",Mumford1

19,Ketorolac Tromethamine,Postoperative Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 10, 2017",8,"I had back surgery. The first night they have me morphine, hydrocodone, robaxin. None of this helped the pain. I was in tears. They finally have me Dilaudid, the first dose of that didn't help, was given a stronger dose of Dilaudid it helped a little. My husband was amazed at all they had given me that did not help. Even with the Dilaudid it wore off to fast. After crying all night & the next day with pain they finally put me in toradol. I had almost instant relief. It was like night & day. Pain went from a 10+ to a 5. But the Dr only gave me 3 doses. Sent home with only hydro & robaxin my pain level has gone back up to at least an 8 & higher than that when the muscle spasms start. Also did not have muscle spasms while taking toradol.",Nightmare at the hospital

After they used the toradol in the IV, I was able to go home and was virtually pain free all day and felt great with no complications for my epilepsy.

I went to the E.R. a few weeks ago with strained muscles between my shoulder bones in my back.   I was given a toradol injection and a prescription for toradol pills.  Only 15 of them.

My teeth were pretty banged up as well and I'm probably going to have to get some root canals or teeth removed once my jaw heals up, but I can say that for as long as I was taking ketorolac, I wasn't experiencing basically any pain, nor was I groggy or tired.

Please! Toradol won't even kill a migraine. Just because some big pharm study came out falsely proclaiming that an anti-inflammatory is more effective than IV opioids for post op pain is utter BS. I was miserable, crying and the hospital wouldn't even let me have 2 Advil except every 4 hours! there is something seriously wrong with our health care system when Toradol is considered first line pain control after ANY invasive surgery. are these people crazy? I left the hospital because they were simply making me more upset which aggravated my pain further.",Sick of doctors

My 2nd day there I had to have surgery. Post op I took only Toradol, it did great for managing my pain. I chose not to go the narcotic route due to my drug abuse history. Had it not been for this medication, I could have very well been on the road to relapse following my surgery.
