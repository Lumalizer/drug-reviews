0,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 10, 2022",0,"I had a total knee replacement about 18 hours ago. They did a pain block which worked great, until the last 4-5 hours. Now they are giving me Toradol with 3 OTC Tylenol.  With the block now wearing off, the Toradol is not working at all. It just doesn’t work on me. I’m in misery.",Glinda E.
1,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,10.0,,"October 12, 2020",8,"Post-op major orthopedic surgery, Toradol was great pain management, moderate nausea, mild tinnitus, mild headache and decreased urination. I can function better than when I’ve taken opioids. Sedation is transient about 90 minutes after dose. 10/10",Anonymous

3,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 21, 2019",13,"I was given Toradol following an appendectomy (via my IV) & was impressed with how well it worked. It did make me sleepy, but it also helped my stress-induced migraine! Will have to discuss this option with my neurologist.",Anonymous

5,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 3, 2018",8,This was given to me after multiple surgeries stemming from a botched gallbladder removal. This drug gave me horrible hallucinations and extremely vivid dreams. It scared me to death out and made me sweat profusely. I don’t ever want anything to do with this drug again.,Gallstonegirl
6,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,3.0,,"May 7, 2018",105,"Toradol can be very dangerous and the drug company is trying to make it sound like it is the ""cure all"" for narcotic pain control. Did they tell you that Toradol is like ibuprofen? Did they tell you it can cause ulcers? This is not the drug for pain control. We have morphine and dilaudid, which provide excellent relief without gut bleeds and ulcers, along with blood thinning. All the hospitals are worried about is the opioid crisis (that they created by handing them out like candy), but no one wants to talk about the methamphetamine crisis that is ruining this country. How about dealing with that, and let me give my poor patients some pain relief with morphine or dilaudid.",Lucygirl RN
7,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 14, 2017",7,"Given to me in an IV immediately after laparoscopic hysterectomy.  Don’t know if they gave me too much or not but I could not stay awake for a few hours.  They had to increase my  IV just to flush it out.  But I will say one thing....I had absolutely NO PAIN that evening, the next day, or even the following week.  Excellent.",Sharon R.
8,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 25, 2017",10,"I was prescribed Toradol for pain management after a breast reduction recently, and after spine surgery years ago. I found it ineffective both times. I switched to Tylenol extra strength, which is only slightly better for pain, but without the side effects. After spine surgery, I took one Toradol then threw out the bottle and switched, I also used an ice pack throughout the day.The pain after my breast reduction was much more severe, so I gave the Toradol a few days hoping it would work, but it just gave me horrible stomach pain in addition to the pain from surgery.I don't recommend it for severe pain, and will ask for something else in the future",Mumford1
9,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,,,"October 18, 2016",12,"It was used in an IV after a hemmorhoidectomy. I also have epilepsy which I am not on medication for. After they used the toradol in the IV, I was able to go home and was virtually pain free all day and felt great with no complications for my epilepsy. After the toradol wore off, even with other pain medication, I could see what a difference it made. It is a woňďer drug!",KatMon
10,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,1.0,,"July 25, 2016",90,"I was shocked when I woke up from my C-section and was very coldly told by my robot nurse that I was ""allowed"" 4 injections of TORADOL for having my gut ripped open and 2 children taken out. Please! Toradol won't even kill a migraine. Just because some big pharm study came out falsely proclaiming that an anti-inflammatory is more effective than IV opioids for post op pain is utter BS. I was miserable, crying and the hospital wouldn't even let me have 2 Advil except every 4 hours! there is something seriously wrong with our health care system when Toradol is considered first line pain control after ANY invasive surgery. are these people crazy? I left the hospital because they were simply making me more upset which aggravated my pain further.",Sick of doctors
11,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,3.0,,"January 10, 2016",12,Post root canal.  Taken orally 10mg tabs.  Minor relief of pain but severe stomach cramps.  Stopped taking them and took advil liquid gels/ extra strength tylemol combo which proved way more effective.  Took another Toradol a few days later with same results.  Stomach cramps and minor pain relief.,helen1933
12,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,8.0,,"February 12, 2015",22,"I'm three days post operation for a hemorrhoidectomy and a fissure repair. The pain is horrible, but the Toradol is working well. It works much better than the narcotics prescribed (Tramadol).",Tony 12
13,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 13, 2014",18,I had rotator cuff and bone spur surgery a week ago. At first they gave me hydrocodone 750 and I was still in pain so they changed me to Toradol 10 mg and I still have no relief. I have been in unrelenting pain for 7 days and I can't believe no one can help me!,Kaye45
14,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 4, 2013",37,"I had an emergency C-section, and the morphine they gave me wasn't touching my pain.  I was in agony.  They gave me Toradol through my IV, and I finally felt relief.  I was bummed that they only let me have a few doses, since it helped so much, but I understand it has a lot of possible side effects. I didn't have any while I was on it, though.",Anonymous

16,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,9.0,,"August 19, 2012",33,"I have a long history of narcotic drug dependency, mainly heroin use. I went into the ER with an insect bite which was infected because I had tried to drain it myself. Don't Do That! I was given IV Toradol during my 5 day stay in the hospital. My 2nd day there I had to have surgery. Post op I took only Toradol, it did great for managing my pain. I chose not to go the narcotic route due to my drug abuse history. Had it not been for this medication, I could have very well been on the road to relapse following my surgery.  I do have to mention that IV Toradol does wonders for me but when I had a prescription for the pills, they gave me awful nightmares and upset stomach along with some other unwanted side effects.",Anonymous
17,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,,,"November 18, 2011",13,"I had a C-section and the first day they gave me Toradol injections.  I have to say, it definitely helped the pain for me and I did not have any side effects.  I was concerned about it going through breast milk while I was receiving it but I was told by the nurses not to worry.  I would definitely use it again and recommend it if someone inquired about it.",Anonymous

21,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,5.0,,"January 31, 2010",17,"Was given this after three wisdom teeth were taken out.  Can't say it made a big difference in the pain though I don't know what it would have been like without it. It was definitely not enough to stop the pain.  Had to resort to the hydrocodone to withstand the pain. That was better than Toradol.  So overall, not a big fan of the Toradol.",wisdom tooth

23,Toradol,Postoperative Pain,10.0,,"August 17, 2009",19,I was so very pleased to have taken this pain reliever following surgery.  It was strong enough to help with the pain yet I had none of the nausea and dizziness that I get with most other pain medicines.,Anonymous
