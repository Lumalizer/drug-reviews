0,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 1, 2022",0,"From my personal experience it made me much more likely to get sick, only slowed the progression of PA and even then it still progresses. Does nothing about the pain, when considering the fact that it does nothing but slow the progression sort of and makes me much more likely to get sick I would say this is not worth taking and would rather take something else which I am now.",LHJ
1,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 15, 2021",0,"My first med after failing to respond to NSAIDs since diagnosed with spondyloarthrits. Liver enzymes gone up a bit and some mild hair loss, but no other side effects after 8 months on it. The drug provided only partial / intermittent control of the arthritis though.",duduqa
2,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 19, 2021",2,"I had to stop taking Methotrexate injection 15mg per 0.30 ml (Rasuvo) 1/wk, because of a fatty liver diagnosis. The failing liver was only caught by ultrasound, and not by blood test.I would notice after my injection, about an hour to even day after the injection, an uncomfortable upper right abdomen burning sensation. My rheumatologist finally listened after the Gastro doctor detected fatty liver. Up until then, they were citing other possible causes. Now, I'm trying to take a prescribed alternative, Leflunomide 10mg tablet (lowest dosage). However, about an hour after taking the Leflunomide, I experienced the same right side upper abdomen burning. The doctor recommends I split the tiny pill in half, see if I can tolerate the half, and then increase back to a whole pill once the 1/2 is tolerated. I am also on a biologic (2 injection) of Cosentyx, 150mg (2 inj = 300mg), that I'm taking every 2 weeks. I don't seem to be having a side-effect from the biologic med.",lkaticich
3,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 2, 2021",1,On methotrexate for one year. It is a love/loathe kind of relationship with this drug. I am on a two week drug holiday and see I really need something but only having 2-3 days out of the week feeling good is a hard sell. I take 25 mg per week via injection. Have been using zofran for the nausea and vomiting. It works sometimes. I think I am ready to try something else.,Jenny
4,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 8, 2021",1,"Taking 15mg for a month. For me the   the benefits didn't out weigh side effects. I would be so tired, didn't  have the energy to do household tasks. Also had headaches, depression, felt blah, mouth sores, stomach acid even though taking folic acid too. Both of my hands would break out in itchy blister bumps for a couple of days right after taking dosage. Refuse to take again",Leftie
5,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,1.0,,"April 15, 2021",4,I told myself I would never take methotrexate until it was prescribed. I read all of the user reviews and the doctors promote this as some miraculous drug. I started taking this first dose last Saturday and split the dose the first day by taking half in the morning and the rest at night. A recommendation for helping with nausea. My body has still not recovered. On Sunday I started vomiting at 4:00pm and followed with severe diarrhea. So bad that I could not make it to the bathroom. None of the reviews mentioned vomiting and diarrhea especially nonstop. I ended up going to the ER for so much vomiting and diarrhea so bad that I couldn't keep water down. This drug is awful. It is 4 days later and I have thrown up again last night and I am still having nausea and stomach pain. I have to go to the doctor tomorrow. I wonder how long these effects can last. The ER told me not to take anymore of this drug. My dosage was 15mg once weekly. The doctor prescribed me sulfasalazine as a replacement,AMH
6,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 2, 2020",90,"Didn't want to take this drug  methotrexate was anxious after reading various reviews and stuff on internet  but Dr advised I needed it for my arthritis (psoriatic) also said that when I felt the results I'd wished I'd taken it before now.  I also like a drink he said so do I have one just don't go daft. So far bloods are ok and he was right - wished I'd tried methotrexate ages ago.  Before taking it I couldn't fasten laces, walk down stairs, hands were painful found it hard to do my job and ankle pain. What a difference this drug has made virtually pain free and  now I am using stairs etc as normal it took me a little while to get used to it it and it does make me tired for a day or so after I take it but after that I feel great.  I  hope this helps someone.",Badger
7,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 22, 2020",28,"I take 8 pills once a week. 4 in morning 4 in evening. At first thought it was so awful, no appetite,  no energy, upset stomach. Then changed to taking dosage to 2 times in that day has helped. Still have appetite loss and some foods make me feel ill. My pain is gone so I applaud methotrexate. I take swim aerobics now trying to build strength up. Only problem is I have low hemoglobin but I am sure Dr will figure out. I take 2 folic acid daily. I am prediabetic, take metformin but no drinking.",Gcq1109
8,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 14, 2020",33,"I've been taking a combo therapy of sulfasalazine and methodextrate for 5 months. Started at 15 mg. Per week and now down to 5mg. Sulfasalazine remained same the same.Each month inflamation markers are lower. When diagnosed, marker was 24 and last visit was 3. The swelling decreased a lot and don't have the level of pain when first started. Side effects are minimal.  Tired the day after but nothing too major. Hair thinning.Still able to bodybuild daily. As a matter of fact, after starting methodextrate, I've felt better overall and have been able to pack on more muscle. Overall, good experience",Franky
9,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 19, 2019",29,"Was on methotrexate for 5 months for Psoriatic Arthritis (PA).  The drug completely cleared my skin but did not help at all with joint inflammation.  Pain increased while on the drug and x-rays showed my PA still progressed while taking the methotrexate.  My fatigue significantly worsened while on this drug, to the point that I was struggling to do basic day-to-day tasks.  Doctor took me off methotrexate and put me on Humira and I feel much better in regards to pain and fatigue, although some small psoriasis patches are coming back.",Anonymous
10,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,9.0,,"October 1, 2018",21,"Been on and off methotrexate for the last 14 years. I got psoriatic arthritis at 22, now 36. It takes time to work, around 2-3 months. Folic acid every Thurs and Fri. I usually only have 1 or 2 alcoholic drinks at the weekend and liver ok.I also use Dandrazol 2% shampoo in my face, which seems to help the skin. Dry after and use tea tree moisturiser. Also, must take vitamin D over colder months. Rishi a natural drug also helps",Anonymous

12,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 22, 2018",22,I hated this med!  The exhaustion I experienced was completely disabling.  Being in pain but awake was better than this.,LN
13,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 28, 2018",28,"I took the maximum dosage of this medication for 10 years and toward the end, the side effects were horrible. It did a wonderful job of keeping my Psoriatic Arthritis at bay but at a cost. Fatigue is terrible. I would take it Saturday night so that initial side effects occurred while I slept. Every Sunday was a sleep day. My stomach felt like it was burnt. The last straw was psychosis and depression which gradually and subtly developed over time. I told my doctor I refused to take this medication anymore. She prescribed Enbrel and I am much happier. It works well without the ""MTX Hangover.""",Tom K.
14,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,7.0,,"December 15, 2017",21,"I started on Sulfasalazine in 1997 and have been on methotrexate for about 18 months.

15,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 16, 2017",17,Second time around with the methotrexate .I use it as a bridge drug until I find one that works. I was on enbrel and humira for past 15 yrs. both worked extremely well but lost potency after about 7 yrs. Now in search of new drug now trying Otezla it's not a biological and has less side effects of all others I have researched. I don't like the methotrexate. Long  term because of hair loss and the continued dosing changes. But fortunately now we have many drugs to choose from finding one that works and is safe and effective is the dilemma.,Mattcat

18,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,8.0,,"November 17, 2016",19,"After becoming sick with this disease doctor initially started me on methotrexate pills and I developed what they call ""phantosmia""...I smelled horrible things that weren't there.  So we switched to injections and didn't get the smells anymore.  Then he started Enbrel as well.  I felt good for awhile and decided to stop the methotrexate because it was making me tired and weak.  Two years later, I'm back on if because my back and neck were killing me and  I'm getting 60-70%r relief after one shot of .8.  Pretty happy about that but the trade off of sleeping all day and being weak and nauseated all reminded me of why I stopped too.  But it does help so you weigh what's important to you.",Autoimmune mom in the desert
19,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 29, 2016",25,"I only tried one dose which as a disaster.  It did nothing to reduce the pain, first off.  I got an immediate flare-up of my psoriasis symptoms on day 1.  Days 2,3,4 I was so weak and faint I couldn't stand-up for more than 5 - 10 minutes.  I was essentially bed-ridden and unable to eat much for 3 days!  Also, I became extremely depressed and spent those 3 days in bed researching ways to kill myself (?!?)  I also got mouth sores and bleeding gums.  On day 7 the medication finally wore-off and I ""snapped-out"" of the depression as if a light-switch were turned back on.  It was eerie and frightening to think a drug reaction would actually make me want to end my own life!  I am sad it didn't work for me.  I know others who use it fine.",Nat Kat

I'm highly sensitive to medication and was given 10mg and 5mg of Folic Acid all days except dose day. I managed to get to work the next day but was very fatigued, vague and couldn’t function too well. I have never felt so tired as I did the weekend after and had to cancel all my plans. From Friday night, I was totally wiped out, no appetite, couldn’t stay awake, tummy ache, headache and since sunday strands of hair have been falling out.

22,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,,,"July 9, 2016",15,"Never felt so Ill! I take 25mg weekly via injection. Never suffered side effects with other medication. This stuff is a horrible poison. Mouth ulcers,sickness that never goes away. Too many bloodtests to count. Constant fatigue. Dull depressed headache's and joint pain which means other pills,which means other pills to counter-act the side effects of the other lot! Ad-infinitum. Depressing really. On the plus side,(there is one suprisingly),more mobility. I am a resident of the UK so our health care system will be alien to you.

23,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,7.0,,"June 7, 2016",18,"I'm curious can methotrexate cause weight gain I rarely eat anymore except for the three days leading up to my next dose I'm fatigued, headaches, weak food causes acid so I must be very careful that I eat bland foods with little fat and since I've only been on it for 5 weeks I'm in the MORE PAIN part of getting used to the meds part of all of this.

24,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 20, 2016",31,Works moderately well and with few side effects for me. I take 7.5-10mg a week along side 200mg twice daily hydroxycloroquine ( plaquenil) and 1mg folic acid 6 times a week ( not on my MTX day) . It's pretty cheap with insurance and even without it. The side effect that I get is metallic taste in mouth / tingles in my tongue towards my bottom teeth and loss of appetite ( which is common to me on any arthritis medications and ever since I got arthritis in the first place ) and feeling slightly sick after I take the pills. The drug definitely has had a positive effect on my pain levels though and has even led to a reduction in my overall meds . I'm feeling much better then I used to and am able to work and have a pretty normal life again.,Cash hardy

26,Methotrexate,Psoriatic Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 26, 2015",52,Methotrexate has a profound effect on my life. I have been taking it for nearly 5 months and can walk freely again after 6 long months of suffering. I have experienced no major side effects and have even lost a little weight which was surprising. Another pleasing change was not only did my arthritis clear up rapidly but my skin has cleared as well. My nails are also smoother and less pitted. Methotrexate is truly a wonder drug. It has transformed my life. It is remarkable.,Megan NZ
