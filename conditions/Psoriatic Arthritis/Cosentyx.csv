0,Cosentyx,Psoriatic Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 30, 2022",0,"I was on 25mg of prendisolone and 20mg of Arava, and sulfalsasine, for PSA. My rheumatologist put me on cosentyx after a fecal test for ibd which was negative. 2 days after my first loading dose I noticed pain in my rectum and fissures. I then couldn’t go to toilet and couldn’t sleep waking in anxiety in middle of night absolutely excruciating pain. I rang my gp and rheumatologist and they told me it would go away and to keep going, I injected next dose only to be worse so was sent for a colonoscopy which came back clear? So diagnosed me with ibs? I refused to keep taking cosentyx as my cosentyx nurse also said this raised red flags. My rheumatologist switched me to humira which is absolutely my miracle drug, I am off all other drugs just humira no pain in joints and skin fully clear. I am back to a normal life swimming and working physically. Love humira",Cambell ryan
1,Cosentyx,Psoriatic Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 17, 2021",0,"I was diagnosed 3 years ago with psoriasis. I'm pretty sure I've had it for a long time. Red spots appeared on my legs so the dermatologist biopsied them. The arthritis aspect hit about 2 years ago. I started Cosentyx in July after 3 years on methotrexate (apparently it was affecting my liver enzymes). It worked on my PA pretty quickly but in September I noticed I was extremely aggravated, easily irritated, could not think straight. My thoughts raced so fast that I could not think straight. I could not make decisions. After a lot of research & being told by my adult daughter that I was not myself, I did a lot of digging & research only to find out that Cosentyx can cause manic episodes. That was exactly what happened to me. I've been off it for a month & now I realize that my psoriasis is 100 times worse. I have bumps literally covering my body. I had pustular psoriasis on my toes & now I have  several patches of plaque psoriasis, which is something I did not have before. This sucks.",PA newbie

Last year out of nowhere I got Psoriasis, at first only on my hands and feet but then it spread. I had genital psoriasis I will never forget and scalp psoriasis so bad my hair feel out. I am on cosentyx for five months now, and a lot of topical steroids. My psoriasis has hugely improved but lately it has come back, in places I've never had it before.

8,Cosentyx,Psoriatic Arthritis,4.0,,"March 9, 2021",4,I took the load up doses of 6 one week injections when my body reacted 10x as bad as any case of psoriasis I ever had.  My joints felt numb and my reflexes were dulled  with stomach trauma a side effect during this load up period.  I made a decision to stop the injections and I have to admit even with joint pain and severe psoriatic breakouts I feel better! It’s been more than three months since termination of Cosentyx and my psoriasis breakouts are starting to clear up but seem to be lingering longer than ever before. My reliance on sunshine and healthy diet are now my only solution to controlling psoriatic arthritis now.  I hoped I could find a solution in a drug but now I know drugs don’t fix the problem but diet and exercise can.,Canadian Mike

10,Cosentyx,Psoriatic Arthritis,3.0,,"January 28, 2021",8,"55+ years of psoriasis and 10+ years if psoriatic arthritis.  In the past with Enbrel (caused multiple shingles breakouts), methotrexate (minimal impact on the arthritis).  2 1/2 years ago started on Cosentyx with amazing results for the first 18 months.  After that overall health declined.  Started with loss of taste which progressed to severe pain on swallowing, debilitating ear aches, runny nose, oral blisters on gums, swollen gums, thrush.  Made the decision to stop Cosentyx.  Gradually the impacts from the toxicity of cosentyx are dissipating.   All the psoriatic symptoms are back, as was expected, and worse than ever.  I'm giving my body a year to re-set before I try anything else.  It's a setback physically with the joint pain, but the side-effects caused by Cosentyx as it built up in my body were scary.  Stumped multiple specialists about what was going on as much of what I was experiencing was not listed as known side effects - they are now.",Longago

Skin 100% clear in three weeks  BUT---hives up and down my arms, back to back UTI's -five of them.  I felt a little groggy and like I was wading through chest high water all the time. THEN--major bloody diarrhea.   Major.   By the time I had a colonoscopy I was a mess.   Six weeks of non stop bloody diarrhea.   Diagnosed with Cosentyx induced Ulcerative Colitis.   Four months on prednisone trying to clear it up.  Hoping it is not permanent.   Gastroenterologist said he sees it from Cosentyx a lot.

I lost 50 lbs in 2 months and went into liver failure. I was a skeleton. I couldn't walk or even eat. This drug gave me stomach aches that were so severe, I ended up in the hospital a couple times. It was so hard for me to do anything but I had to force myself if I wanted to survive. I nearly died from this drug and I am only 18 years old. I ended up having Crohns disease as well but my doctor had no idea at the time of this medication. Therefore, the extreme stomach pain and nausea. The smell of food made me throw up.

Prior to that, pustular psoriasis on soles of feet and palms of hands.  Prescribed Enbrel soon after 1st available, effective for 15 yrs,  except for SI joints (still needed bi-lateral knee replacement, rotator cuff surgery & two foot surgeries, not all PsA.)   4 years ago I experienced repeated venous ulcers & stopped Enbrel.  After ulcers resolved, was put on Otezla -  no help w/PsA.  Switched to Cosentyx, initially good and no side effects.  However, after a year, began to experience serious joint swelling in my fingers.   Cosentyx  helped w/ the SI joints - those are mostly pain free.  But swollen fingers = constant pain.  Dr. is adding Arava - avoiding Methotrexate because of diminished kidney function.   Effective Jan 2021,  Cosentyx no longer covered by my insurance, too $$:  choices are Enbrel or Humira.

With this the pain is MOSTLY gone with some bad flair ups but it keeps everything manageable and I no longer need a cane. It is expensive and you will have to try NSAID and DMARD before getting approval. They dealt with my insurance directly. It has worked great.

One to two is normal.  I had to have intravenous antibiotics because I couldn’t keep anything down. No one wanted to believe it was the meds until skin biopsy came back.  The pathologist sent it for second opinion and it came back as hive.  The cause on the lab work was medication. My first sign something was up is that it caused me to break out with psoriasis.,Jay

My psoriasis was and has been fairly mild for some time but within 6 weeks of taking cosentyx I was all clear pretty much.

I did not experience any improvement in my PsA symptoms and in fact would say that my general joint ache, stiffness and pain was worse. Besides seeing no improvement in my primary complaint, I have had 4-5 week long sinus infections, a thrush infection and several days in between with general stomach upset I hadn’t had prior to starting this medication. In switching insurances, they wanted me to try Enbrel first prior to re-ordering cosentyx for some reason.

48,Cosentyx,Psoriatic Arthritis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 4, 2017",17,"Excited to be starting this Biologic as hospital team assured me it was really suitable for the effective  treatment of my psoriatic arthropathy and psoriasis.By the fourth weekly injection I had had two chest infections and the most horrible urinary tract infection.  Three lots of antibiotics and a 7 lb. weightloss due to being so sick, I admitted defeat and didn't take the 5th dose. Admittedly the arthropathy eased slightly during the injection period but this was more likely due to the enforced bed rest due to being so ill than to the effects of the Cosentyx.Goodbye Cosentyx.

I was taken off the medication for approximately 2 months for other medical issue including UTI and started seeing a slight improvement. (at this time we didn't consider that this could be a side effect) I was given the start up dose again because of the gap in treatment and by 3rd shot (start up dose) I was experiencing extreme pain again.    I have been taken off the medication again to see if the bladder pain will improve.   Not thinking what I am experiencing is worth taking the medication.  While on the medication I do not feel there was any improvement to the arthritis pain.",last-Time10
