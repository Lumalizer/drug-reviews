0,Orencia,Psoriatic Arthritis,4,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2021",0,"40 yr old woman with Psoriatic Arthritis. I have already tried Methotrexate (did not work), Humira (too much fog brain), Enbrel (worked great but my body developed immunity), and now I am on Orencia. Week 1 I noticed some slight belly ache as if I did 2000 sit ups. Week 2 it got slightly worse. Week 3 the pain in my upper left abdomen has gotten so bad its hard to sleep. I also have some severe lower abdomen pain so I am hoping this gets better soon. I was off medication for 4 weeks which caused some serious flare ups. Since I started Orencia one of my major flares. One is slowly subsiding while I have developed 2 new issues (knee's & foot). Hoping after some time this gets better.   PS- It was very nice they provided a co-pay card for the $1,000 out-of-pocket upon request",Christina Z
1,Orencia,Psoriatic Arthritis,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 19, 2021",0,I have just had my second infusion of Orencia. The first go around I had a headache and fever and aches for that night and most of the next few days. After the second dose I have severe aches and pains in all joints and muscles and my skin hurts to touch it plus I have a cold or something that just came on a day after the infusion. I am wondering if it is going to work for me or if I need to change. I was on Simponi Aria for a year and a half and then it stopped working. My question is are these symptoms considered bad or something that I have to put up with and hope they go away and the Orencia starts working without these side effects?,Mindy
2,Orencia,Psoriatic Arthritis,8,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 28, 2020",20,"Orencia took about three months for the full benefit to kick in. Been on it for nine months now with great joint movement. Hope this keeps up - cost about six thousand a month which insurance pays. Yes - I am fortunate,",duggywuggy
