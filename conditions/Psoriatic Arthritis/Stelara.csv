I was finally diagnosed when I was 43 years old. I’m now on my 5th biologic which is Stelera. It never showed signs of working, but I’ve been patient and giving it plenty of try’s. This is now my 6th dose and I will be making another doctor visit to change medications.",Quilter

3,Stelara,Psoriatic Arthritis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 19, 2019",7,I have had psoriasis for 18 years and psoriatic arthritis for 2 years.  Methotrexate helped at first but stopped helping psoriasis and arthritis was worsening.  Then put on Humira as it was amazing for my arthritis (in 2 days noticed difference) but did not help appearance of psoriasis. Then switched to Stelara.  Had first two doses and experienced temporary itching right after doses.  The appearance of psoriasis has improved but my arthritis is terrible.  Wish I could find one for both but if I had to choose I would pick being able to move without pain.,Anonymous
4,Stelara,Psoriatic Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 22, 2019",6,"Have had Psoriatic Arthritis for over a decade sometime in my early 40s.  Have used many drugs, Enbrel, Humira, Sympony, Cosyntex and now Stelara.  May have used one other one but can't recall its name.  Mixed methotrexate with embrel in the beginning which worked well but have have liver count so didn't want to take methotrexate.  For me, Enbrel worked ok, Humira worked great, Sympony didn't work at all and Cosyntex didn't work on the psoriasis side very well.  Most of the drugs kept the arthritis at bay to an extent.  I had an allergic reaction to Humira twice so had to quit it.  Stelara seems to work well so far after not quite a year.  Psoriasis has improved pretty well in several areas although now I have more dry skin around my eyes and forehead which is new to me.  Drugs react differently for everyone so keep on trying them.",PSA patient

6,Stelara,Psoriatic Arthritis,10.0,,"August 17, 2018",14,"My psoriasis was so bad. Angry red, layers upon layers of scaling on both legs, elbows, even the groin area sometimes. I've been on so many medications for so many years I've lost count. Stelara is a miracle drug for me. After the first shot, within those first 30 days my scaling was 99.9% GONE!! It's been over a week since the second shot and my skin looks amazing. I can't say enough good things about this medication. I don't have to wear jeans and long sleeves in 90 degrees heat this summer! Thank you so much Stelara!",Boston65
7,Stelara,Psoriatic Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 15, 2018",13,"Severe psoriasis for 36 years. Progressed into psoriatic arthritis. 90% of body covered. Stelara has drastically changed the way I feel and look. 85% clear and arthritis has subsided. My quality of life is something I cannot put into words.

8,Stelara,Psoriatic Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 16, 2018",18,"Had a mild case of Psoriasis - just one patch and some dandruff scales. Had Psoriatic arthritis for about two years -  morning stiffness, swollen small joints and knee pains - I endured these for almost two years. On Doctor's advice started Stelara. After the started dosage, she also prescribed Remicaid for a few weeks. However, it took almost a week for my Pharmacy to fill Remicaid.Within 3-4 days of taking this medicine, I felt better slightly and stopped my daily Celebrex. And when my Pharmacy called me to pick-up Remicaid, I said I don't need it! Within two weeks I could feel better enough to stop Celebrex. I took my second shot about 6 weeks ago. At this point my joint pains are 90% gone. I am almost back to normal. I am able to wear my wedding ring that I removed before finger stared swelling.I am back to going to Gym - build my muscles back up. Life is good!Bobby",Bobby
9,Stelara,Psoriatic Arthritis,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 18, 2018",4,Humira worked great for my psoriatic arthritis. Unfortunately my new insurance didn’t cover the dosages.

Two years later I developed psoriatic arthritis and stelara did not help my arthritis. My dr switched me to cosentyx back in April and my lower leg is broke out and cosentyx is not helping my arthritis. My dr is swithing me to taltz now. I have never taken any TNF's such as Humira but may have too.",sandbaby26

I was on remecade and decided to try something else so my RMD put me on stelara.

13,Stelara,Psoriatic Arthritis,9.0,,"June 6, 2017",31,"I have had severe psoriasis for 22 years. Last year I developed psoriatic arthritis too. The pain was debilitating and made dealing with my skin even harder. It took doctors 6 mth  to prescribe Stelara but once I got it, I got my life back. I've only had 2 jabs but I feel fantastic and my skin us 100% improved. A wonder drug for me. I pray to God it doesn't fail like Humira and Cosentyx. Good luck to all of you suffering with these horrific disease's",Debidibdobs

17,Stelara,Psoriatic Arthritis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 23, 2016",20,Stelara has lowered all the inflammatory  markers in my bloods to within a normal range. This however doesn't repair damage already done. I am however suffering much less of burning in the joints. The aching is still pretty much the same. I was previously on Embrel and have been on Stelara for only two months so a way to go yet. SO far so good.,Ablast
18,Stelara,Psoriatic Arthritis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 19, 2016",23,I have had psoriatic arthritis for 20 years. Mostly attempting to control the arthritis which at times has been debilitating to say the least. For the first year my skin was clear after the loading doses. I wore shorts and went swimming without fear! And while I'm still very happy with stelara I've noticed it doesn't control my arthritis as well (still manageable) and I have small patches beginning to appear. I'm well under the 200lb weight for the higher dose.,AnnaKumquat
19,Stelara,Psoriatic Arthritis,10.0,,"July 19, 2016",38,"I've been on Humira and Enbrel. Hands down those two were the worse experiences of my life. So many side effects. I've tried Methroxate and that was even worse!! Finally, I was introduced to Stelara and I haven't had a flare up for two years now. I work out 5 days a week (weight lifting and cardio) and just have the normal muscle soreness. My joints haven't gotten worse at all. My psoriasis is pretty much all gone. I've had no side effects that I can remember. I haven't gained or lost weight. Long term, not sure how this will affect me but I want the quality of life now and I got it with this shot. most insurances will have you paying $200 but if you get the Stelara card, it goes to a $5 per shot copay! (every three months).",nebskersfan
20,Stelara,Psoriatic Arthritis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 29, 2015",25,"I have had psoriatic arthritis for the past 12 years every treatment failed on me including photo therapy, humira, enbrel, etc.  I was covered approximately 70% and completely covered on my face and head.  I tried stelara and after 6 months got decent clearance I could see my face again.  I am at one year now and at month 10 it just failed hard,  I right back where I started.  I can just shake my head, hair, and face over a sink and completely cover it scales, chunks, paste, and slough from my psoriasis.  I very frustrated .  No one should have to live through this.  I haven't been on a date in over a decade.  No one even talks to me, I am in complete isolation. I hate stelara because it gave me hope",Crusty One

Horrible lower back pain, symptoms of psa worsening each month, psoriasis worsening each month and the last shot has permanently discolored the skin on my thigh in a 3inch by 2in area.

22,Stelara,Psoriatic Arthritis,9.0,,"January 27, 2014",53,"I am 65. I have had psoriasis and arthritis since I was 13. I was covered. Like others I had used tar, creams, PUVA , UVB in my home and ENBREL which caused many side effects. Dreaded white flakes everywhere! Itching was just awful. 2 1/2 years ago I tried Stelara, what a wonder I cleared in 2 injections. What a joy to have clear skin and go in public and not be embarrassed. Had to stop because Medicare did not cover it. I became totally covered again worse then ever. Finally found some finical help. I have had 2 injections, all plaque is gone looks so good. I have  a great deal of redness but expect it to clear. I have had a madding itch the past few days, hope it is not a side effect. ",Cootie 1234
