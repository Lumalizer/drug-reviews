0,Tremfya,Psoriatic Arthritis,3,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 21, 2022",0,"Tremfya was OK for Psoriasis but terrible for joint pain.  Hobbled down stairs all day long, did not get better thru the day, cannot walk much. Have been in aqua PT for several months.  Now rheumy switched me to Stelara every 8 weeks, cannot wait to start it and go for a walk!",High Chaparral
1,Tremfya,Psoriatic Arthritis,2,,"March 2, 2022",0,"Tremfya was the worst experience I gave it more than a year actually 14 months and then those 14 months I had a horrible rheumatologist put me on methotrexate which caused chronic UTI's she didn’t diagnose them I suffered with aSED rate of 120 which a normal SED rate should be 30, The reason I was put on methorexate is because I was still in severe pain with every joint inflamed while on the Tremfya.  It is horrible for psoriatic arthritis but it did work very very well for my plaque psoriasis.If you have just a few patches of plaque but have bad joint pain do not take this medication try Otesla it has worked miracles on me I cannot believe I suffered for 14 months with Tremfya",Pamela
2,Tremfya,Psoriatic Arthritis,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 9, 2021",2,"Last med I took was Otezla before Tremfya, but I chose the wrong insurance plan this past year and eventually couldn't afford Otezla.  My rheum prescribed Tremfya then.  Back to injections.  I've previously taken Humira and presented with PsA WHILE taking it.  Does Tremfya work - meh.  It's not controlling the PsA or P very well.  I mean, I was once unable to dress myself, walk, etc. when the PsA presented, so I'm not back to that point.  I wake sore and stiff.  My elbows have broken out again.  I also have PPP, and I don't have the pustules, but the peeling on my feet is back.  I had to have mtx added back on, and this time subQ.  So now I'm taking both the 8-week autoinjector Tremfya and a subQ once a week to replace Otezla.  I believe the interleukin inhibitors just don't work for me very well, and the PDE4 inhibitors do.  After Jan 1 when my good insurance plan kicks in, I'm asking my rheum to put me back on Otezla.  Tremfya barely does anything for me.",Kristie
3,Tremfya,Psoriatic Arthritis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 6, 2021",1,"I have tried everything under the sun for my  psoriatic arthritis methotrexate, tanning beds, light therapy at a doctors office, cimzia injections.. etc etc.. then my  dermatologist prescribed Tremfya as I had over 80% of my body covered in psoriasis.. my arms are now clear and I haven’t been able to wear a short sleeve shirt in YEARS.",Username918393
4,Tremfya,Psoriatic Arthritis,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 25, 2021",8,"I am just about to have my fourth injection.  I have not noticed any improvement in joint pain, fatigue or enthesitis.  My scalp psoriasis is slightly improved.  Initially my joint pain was much worse but now I am back to my baseline joint pain.  Still waiting for any other improvements….",Still waiting..
5,Tremfya,Psoriatic Arthritis,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 24, 2021",15,"It sure has helped me. I have been having Tremfya injections for almost a year now, it improved my skin and scalp after third injection. I have noticed some improvement with joint pain and swelling. The day of injection I get fatigue  and the next day tired easy, other then that this injection is working great for me.",Misty
6,Tremfya,Psoriatic Arthritis,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 26, 2021",14,"I have scalp psoriasis and arthritis  and am allergic to steroids, tried topical nothing worked. Took my first Tremfya injection last night and I feel horrible, like I have been hit by a truck. Can barely get out of bed, if this is what it’s going to be like I’m not going to take it.. not worth it, praying I feel better tomorrow.",Aychicks
