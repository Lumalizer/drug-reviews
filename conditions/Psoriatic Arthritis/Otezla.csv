0,Otezla,Psoriatic Arthritis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 30, 2022",0,It worked with most side effects in the first month. My hands felt great 30% swelling down. The toughest part of the long term plan is being able to pay for it. At first it is free all is good until the co pay runs out. Next the pharmacy calls to say your prescription is ready but they need an extra 1200$ to refill. Next I check my insurance plan. I picked the highest level plan the most expensive. They say oh no we won’t pay until it hits 4500$. Then after that we will only cover 70% that would leave again 1200$ a month to pay out of pocket. I don’t know anyone who is able too be on this drug for any long term. It’s the old drug dealer scam. Give it to you for free until you get hooked on it. Then start squeezing the money out of you. The company that makes this drug are no better than the street dealers. I had no choice to stop taking it. Too bad they can’t make it affordable for the average person.,Shane
1,Otezla,Psoriatic Arthritis,5.0,,"December 22, 2021",1,"I started this medication about 3 weeks ago. I have psoriatic arthritis. I am having all the sideEffects of the medication. I’m going to the bathroom immediately after eating something small. I’m going to try to make it to 8 weeks. It has helped my pain levels, but it hits hard on the stomach. Hopefully it goes away in the weeks to come. I’m allergic to steroids and biologics. I’m coming to a point where every medication doesn’t agree with me. I’m hoping it gets better!",Maddie

3,Otezla,Psoriatic Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 28, 2021",1,"After getting psoriatic arthritis, I was told to sign up for otezla with the no copay card by a doctor.  So I went online, got the no copay card, started the process to obtain Otezla.  The company sent me a 28 day starter pack.  And that was it.  My next doctor visit the doctor asked how it was going. I explained the 28 day supply I received was great, but I didn't get anymore.  The doctor had a nurse call to find out why I only received one month worth.  The nurse managed to get another month sent to me after that visit, and again, that was all.  When I called the doctor to explain I only received one month, I was told by the nurse that the company said I was noncompliant.  The company never told me what I was non compliant for.  So I suppose if you get the no copay card, this is the way they treat people.",non compliant?

Normally my hand and elbow hurt too badly first thing in the morning to even hold a coffee mug but I am on day 6 of Otezla and have woken up pain free for the first time in a year! I had violent diarrhea on days 2 through 4, along with an annoying headache but both of those went away yesterday. Hopefully this is the beginning of a pain free way of life. Too soon to know. I did feel compelled to share because some reviews are very scary.  From the short time I've taken Otezla, I can tell that it is best taken on a full stomach. I think I can handle a little nausea from time to time if it means pain free living. My psoriasis is already getting better too. Good luck to all.",Bepo

It started out ok, but then I became nauseous, couldn't eat, had diarrhea, but I was managing. Then my joints got worse and worse, I couldn't move. The final straw was I took an evening dose and severely began vomiting. I stopped taking it and called the doctor. I have been without it almost 48 hours and while my stomach is still a little queazy, I'm not nearly as sore and don't feel miserable. 90% of my symptoms came on as a result of this medication, it might have helped a little with my plaque psoriasis, but not enough to keep feeling miserable.

8,Otezla,Psoriatic Arthritis,1.0,,"March 25, 2021",44,"Hi.  I just need someone to know that Otezla changed my husband's mood from pleasant to hostile.  At first I just thought he was getting older and moodier. Then I asked him if he was taking something--he was--Otezla.  But he has terrible psoriatic arthritis and wouldn't go off the drug, so  I started to deal with it, knowing that saying the simplest thing like, 'pass the salt' could cause a war.   Flash forward a year, and his Otezla is no longer covered.  It's a miracle.  This loss of benefits is a gift from God to me  He's back to his old self.  He's pleasant, and kind and wakes up like a human being should, not an angry, hungry black bear.  The f-bombs have gone from about 100 a day to zero.  I've heard this can happen to 2% of the people who use Otezla.  In this case, Otezla could have destroyed our marriage. I hope I help someone.  And I hope I don't deter someone who is helped by Otezla.  God bless.",Anonymous

Last week, I went to the ER with severe stomach pain. After having a CT, blood work and other tests that came up with nothing to cause this pain, I went home with a script for pain meds. After reviewing 'new' things in my life, I decided that Otezla would have to be the next thing to try. So I contacted my Dr and she agreed to have me go off of it for a week to see what would happen. Every day since then my pain has lessened and lessened. Now, 4 days later, I can breathe without pain, get up by myself, walk semi normally and go almost all day without a pain pill. I can only expect that this will continue until the pain is totally gone - at least I hope that will be the result as there is no other reason for this pain.

I have to say at first it did help with the psoriasis on my scalp. But I began to have vertigo and felt like I was in a fog. I am still working full time and need to be alert. Also not sure if this is the cause but I am losing my hair. I stopped taking Otezla a week ago and I am not as out of it, although my joint pain and stiffness is really bad so I may need to look into another drug.

That alongside my psoriatic arthritis and regular psoriasis. I was pretty much covered head-to-toe and miserable. After having six months of methotrexate I really didn't want to to be back on a med. The pain from it all got unbearable so I went in for an appointment and was recommended otezla because of my concerns with some of the stronger medicines. At first, it felt similar to methotrexate with the nausea and stomach issues, so I was used to that. However I am now almost 5 months in and at 40 years old I feel like my my memory is gone. I've never had any issues with my memory or fogginess. I have read that psoriatic arthritis can cause this, so who knows. All I know is that I can't take the nausea, the headaches, the GERD, and I believe severe memory issues. I am discontinuing it.",Spots

I was in lucked and my Otezla script was covered 100%.  I started taking it in August and Otezla has knocked out almost all of the morning stiffness in my legs and any joint pains.

All I could try to do was try reduce my extreme discomfort daily, including 20-30 trips to the toilet daily. I lost the daily battle in week 6 where I was taking anti-diarrhea medicine, ant-acids, pesto bismol and eating very bland foods like I had a bad case of colitis.

The only thing I really need to watch is the insomnia. Last night was not a good night for me as I tossed and turned all night but that very well could be from the Prednisone I am also taking, but only for another week or so.

I never could straighten my fingers and the pain was always there regardless. I was 57 when I started and it did take time to be able to completely straighten my fingers with no pain. When being tested prior to taking a medication for PA, I was found to have latent TB. The TB medication slowed down the effectiveness of Ortezla, but if it wasn't for Otezla I wouldn't be able to take anything. Also, because of PA I had chronic plantar fasciitis for 3+ years. Now I can walk with minimal pain. I have a couple more autoimmune disorders which may mask the true results of Otezla, so I may have improved more than I know.

30,Otezla,Psoriatic Arthritis,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 10, 2019",24,I was prescribed this drug after Methotrexate caused liver damage. I started it June 2018 mainly for my Psoriatic Arthritis. Within the first week I was able to ditch my cane and could walk on my own and pain was all but eliminated. That being said I did have fairly mild side effects for about 2 weeks. I was having bowel movements multiple times a day and nothing was solid for that 2 week period. I did lose quite a bit of my appetite for about a month or 2. I thankfully did not have any nausea or anything. Flair ups still caused issues however they were much more manageable. That being said it did nothing for my psoriasis at all which was a little disappointing. Towards the end of December 2018 the drug has become less effective. I have new joints showing symptoms of arthritis and am going to my specialist this coming Friday to discuss options. While it lasted it was a miracle drug. I got about 6-7 months of solid relief hence the 7 rating. Worth a try if your doctor recommends it.,kologa

Unfortunately, I went on medicare this year and am no longer eligible for the zero copay and now my co-pay will be over $1,200/month, which I cannot possibly afford.

From Feb to May I did notice an improvement with pain but in June my hands and feet had such nerve pain I could hardly walk and had trouble planting my little garden. I was told the nerve pain could not be from Otezla. From day one I had 2 hours with diarrhea and was told that too would pass. It didn't. I stopped the drug in December before Christmas and the nerve pain and diarrhea completely stopped. Mind you I still have sore feet and hands but feel so comfortable. I had been on Methtrexate and Humira before this drug and they too had massive problems. I have always had  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but now my Surgeon said it was undiagnosed diverticulitis that I had kept controlled by diet. These drugs made my bowel much worse and now I need a section removed. How sad is that. Is there even a good drug out there?,Bridget

90,Otezla,Psoriatic Arthritis,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 21, 2016",27,"I've had psoriasis for 35 years and  arthritis for perhaps 30.  For about 9 years I took Enbrel and methotrexate with very good results.  Despite my long-term success with this combo, about 6 months ago I decided to replace Enbrel with Otezla, primarily because I wanted to decrease my use of immunosuppressants and because of the cancer risks associated with Enbrel.   For the first 2-3 weeks I had the expected side effects, the worst being having to move my bowels 5-6 times a day.  Also some headaches.  Now, six months in, I think I am ready to go back to Enbrel.   My scalp psoriasis used to be almost non-existent but is now getting bad.  Same for my elbows/forearms.  I also have many aches and pains that I've never had before....",Glicks
91,Otezla,Psoriatic Arthritis,3.0,,"January 19, 2016",12,Thought this would be a perfect treatment for newly diagnosed but relatively minor hand PsA for past 13yrs. Did experience some weight loss that I attribute that to frequent and loose bm's. There was a detectable mood change but again tolerable. My worst problem was muscle spasms that started in one hip migrated to lower back and then to the other hip to the point of not sleeping. I stopped and ramped up slower which seemed to help but starting coming back. Never had any previous problem with side effects of any meds before. I have what should be good benefits working for a world class employer but plan but they would not cough up without trying the immune suppressive stuff first. Currently on sulfasalizine which seems to help enough,howbouthis

One year ago I went on otezla and within 4 months my back and head were completely clear and my legs were vastly improvedI did not experience any side effects to speak of although I did lose 10 lbs.Currently my legs are about 80% clear however after about 5 months of use the palms of my hands and my feet were severely infected with psoriasis to the point were they were cracking and bleeding no matter how much l tried to look after them",Gb75

Plaque psoriasis on elbows, knees, behind ears, and above eyes. After several medications, because insurance requires it, my Rhum gave me a couple choices including Otezla. I will do anything to stay away from immune suppressive drugs, I don't want to trade one problem for another and likely worse. Been using starter packs for a month with good improvement in plaque psoriasis and no noticeable difference in joint pain. Doc says 2-3 months to see full affect. Unfortunately, my insurance slammed the door on me and is refusing to pay for the drug, appeal was denied.

My Insurance refused to pay for it and suggested all kinds of Biologic medications.  I refused the Biologic meds after reading of dangerous side effects. Otezla approved me on a temporary Bridge program while we are fighting the Insurance. Initial results were astonishing. Both the Arthritis pain and the Psoriasis were gone!

I have large patches of psoariasis on my legs and arms, and a smaller one on my scalp.  I'm using steroid ointment on these but nothing is making them go away. I was still hurting pretty badly, even with the drug.  My rheumatologist gave me something called Leflunomide 20 mg(Arrava) to boost the Otezla.
