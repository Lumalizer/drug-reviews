I originally discussed with my Doctor about using Remicade for my P-Arthritis and Psoriasis because it is covered by medicare and Humira is not.  However when I went in I was given Inflectra instead. The nurses tell you it's the same thing or a generic version. They use the Inflectra for prescribed Remicade patients because it costs less.  The Inflectra worked on my first two infusions but by the third  injection it was useless. My arthritis and psoriasis came back in full force. At the last infusion I had an allergic reaction to the Inflectra at the hospital and was told by the nurse that I almost ended up in the ER.  Then when I told the nurse that the Infectra wasn't working anyway, she told me to demand Remicade and they would have to give it to me.  A report about the allergic reaction and Inflectra not working went to my doctor and now I am supposed to start Remicade this weekend.  I'll post a review on Remicade once I have had a few treatments.",Jim
