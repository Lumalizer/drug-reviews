0,Simponi,Psoriatic Arthritis,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 16, 2022",1,I tried the injection once before after coming off of another biologic that made my symptoms worse. I did not really give it a chance as I did not seem to get any better. I was frustrated with my symptoms and took myself off of everything for 3 months. I had terrible joint pain could not open anything up and severe rash flare up so I tried it again with better results so far will be on my second consecutive dose shortly. The only thing I have found odd and maybe unrelated is heart flutters and an upset stomach.,none
1,Simponi,Psoriatic Arthritis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 10, 2021",1,I have gotten worse while taking this drug.  My skin is far worse and I’m incredibly itchy.  I’ve suffered 2 severe middle ear infections and pustule psoriasis that I never had before in places I never had problems.  I took 4 doses all together.  The side effects are not worth it for me.  I’m happy it works for some people unfortunately I am not one of them.,Anonymous
2,Simponi,Psoriatic Arthritis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 27, 2021",5,"An absolute life changer. From living in excruciating pain each day  and struggling to get out of bed - to being absolutely pain free in a matter of only 3 months. No limitations as to what I can do physically, and the psoriasis on my scalp has cleared significantly. I have slight hand tremors but that causes my no trouble and may be due to other causes (23 years old, dosage  once every 4 weeks)",Thommo
3,Simponi,Psoriatic Arthritis,2,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 30, 2020",12,"I tried Simponi for 9 months for psoriatic arthritis. At first it was like a miracle. Then the pustular psoriasis started on my legs, my hair started falling out, and my mood got very strange. Bloodwork showed super high cholesterol which was 3xs what it ever was. Psoriasis flared worse than ever all over my body. My skin has never gone back to normal. Terrible, scary drug. Wish I'd never tried it.",PsA sufferer
4,Simponi,Psoriatic Arthritis,1,,"December 5, 2017",12,"I was on Remicade infusion for 7 years,  I had wonderful results for 6 years, with PSA flares slowly creeping back in the 7th, but not unmanageable.  Rheumy switched me to Simponi.  After 2 injections, while my skin is still clear, the PSA is raging.  I am in terrible pain.  I spoke the my Rheumy once and she said to give it a chance.  Calling her again this morning.  The pain and exhaustion is debilitating and affecting every aspect of my life.I asked he about Taltz and Cosentyx but she wanted to keep me on a TNF blocker.  I'm ready for change.",rrsltx

6,Simponi,Psoriatic Arthritis,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 19, 2017",14,Worked ok on aches and pains but really messed with me mentally. Made me very depressed and socially withdrawals. I feel more fatigue and lot of headaches.,Catterfly78
7,Simponi,Psoriatic Arthritis,9,,"October 12, 2015",23,"It seemed to work well for me right from the start.  I had been on Remicade previously but I had to quit due to losing my insurance.  By the time I went to Simponi I was hurting pretty bad.Unfortunately, it stopped working after a while (18 months) but that has been my personal experience with Biologics.  When it worked, it worked well.",Kevin Bx
8,Simponi,Psoriatic Arthritis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 8, 2015",16,"I have now just taken my 4th injection, I'm as bad as I was if not worse than when I was first diagnosed.  I can barely walk, have swelling in my toes, feet and ankles, as well as my left knee.  Also in my elbows, wrists, hands and fingers ... I have bad psoriasis on my scalp.  I don't think this medication is very good at all and have shown no response to the previous 3 doses and this dose I have been nauseous every since taking it .. I was on Humira previously for about 5 years but I stopped responding and Embrel I had really bad reactions too ... Hoping for something new when I go back to specialist end of month",Piparmaru

10,Simponi,Psoriatic Arthritis,5,,"February 7, 2014",18,"I took Simponi for 8 months before stopping to get pregnant with my son. All of my symptoms had disappeared and I was 100% flare up free. However, after having my little guy and starting the Simponi injections again I have not had any relief to my psoriasis and have experienced 2 flare ups even after upping my dose to every 3 weeks. How can it have worked so well and now not well at all. I have requested an appointment with my rheumatologist to discuss other biologic medicines.",jenniclarke
11,Simponi,Psoriatic Arthritis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 6, 2013",33,No pain after second injection.  98% clear.  Only side efferct so far is nausea at times.  Love this so far.  Humira and Enbrel caused bad site reactions.,worked the best
12,Simponi,Psoriatic Arthritis,9,,"May 21, 2013",53,"I had been taking methotrexate for almost a year with moderate results. My skin cleared almost 80%, and my joints improved approximately 60%, however each time I took my medication I felt really ill for 48 hours afterwards. It was depressing. Anyway my Rheumatologist recommended Simponi. Having read the side effects, etc. I was a little apprehensive about taking Simponi, but after meeting with the Simponi nurse I decided to go with it. After two shots (2 months) I felt a big difference, my joints were no longer stiff and I was almost pain free. After the fourth shot my skin has cleared to 95% and I have no stiffness in my joints. It really is working for me.",Karl Mc
13,Simponi,Psoriatic Arthritis,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 24, 2012",72,"I was almost wheelchair bound, every joint in my body inflamed and lots of pain walking.  Psoriasis was flaring too all over.The day I took my first shot I could feel the joints loosening and pain lessening.  Within 6 months I was virtually pain free and completely mobile.  2 years now and I am riding my bike 25 miles a day and combined with light treatment my skin is 90% clear.",myke99516

15,Simponi,Psoriatic Arthritis,7,,"December 15, 2009",41,I've been using Simponi for Psoriatic Arthritis for 5 months.  Before that I was using Enbrel.  I had a small amount of psoriasis on my scalp before starting Simponi and now I have much more.  I like the once a month injection but believe I'll be returning to Enbrel soon as I believe it did a better job.,Anonymous
16,Simponi,Psoriatic Arthritis,6,,"October 2, 2009",38,"My husband took his first dose last month and is getting ready to take his second dose in a few days.  While I think the drug is working, the Patient Cost Support Program is difficult to deal with and we are still struggling to get reimbursement.",Anonymous
