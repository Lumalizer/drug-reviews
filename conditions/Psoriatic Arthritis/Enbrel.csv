1,Enbrel,Psoriatic Arthritis,2.0,,"September 16, 2021",0,It has a sedative effect on me. Lowers my immune system. Much more work needs to be done for this debilitating condition. Not happy with the garbage that is out there....too many side effects.,Sid
2,Enbrel,Psoriatic Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 18, 2021",0,The drug works good. The problem is if you use the manual syringes they don't make a travel case/bag. They make one for the preloaded syringes. It's like they are trying to force a person to change to the preloaded syringes and they HURT BAD. The manual syringes are like taking a flu shot you barely feel it. The manual syringes are made out of glass so they are much harder to travel with,Morrisbulldog
3,Enbrel,Psoriatic Arthritis,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 26, 2021",4,"I started taking Embrel in 2003.  It was a great drug for me and controlled my psoriasis and inflammation.  16 years later in 2019 I was diagnosed lymphoma in my stomach.  It was the size of a football.  I stopped taking Enbrel right away and a month later it was greatly reduced and 3 months later it was the size of the back of my hand.  Almost 2 years later I'm still getting scanned every 3 or 4 months.  If you are taking this drug don't be complacent and keep an eye out for side effects.  Looking back, I was probably sick with lymphoma for 6 or more months before I started realizing I had a problem and I only found it by luck.",Brepei
4,Enbrel,Psoriatic Arthritis,10.0,,"September 22, 2020",13,"I started enbrel over 20 years ago for psoriatic arthritis. It worked in 3 weeks and and in 6 week my psoriasis was diminished. No one knew that would happen. Well now 20 years later the enbrel is not working. It was a miracle through this time. Before I couldn’t walk, get out of bed, turn a doorknob.  I started Cosentyx 5 weeks ago and the arthritis is at full force and psoriasis is creeping back. What do I do? I was so lucky enbrel lasted so long. Thinking Humira is along the same line? Any thoughts?",Michie
5,Enbrel,Psoriatic Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 28, 2020",10,A complete life changer!  I've been taking Enbrel for almost 17+ years.  I  had just turned 30 and I was hobbling through the grocery store on swollen ankles.  The pain was constant.  My fingers were termed sausage digits. Now I'm 50 and doing pilates and an hour on the elliptical some days... taking my kids on 10 mile hikes up mountains.  I had not heard that it was linked to colitis and Crohn's until these posts.  I've had those show symptoms twice during my Enbrel years. But I am still an Enbrel fan all the way.  Miraculous!,SGal

I was able to get out of bed with no knee pain and hold my cup of coffee with no pain.  The side effects I have read scare me, but I have to try.  I am 51 years old and could not continue with that pain still too young to deal with that.  Oh and let me tell you how I actually ran down the stairs this morning.

10,Enbrel,Psoriatic Arthritis,10.0,,"April 18, 2019",52,"I was on it for 15 years. It changed my life. I have psoriasis really bad. Thanks to Enbrel,  no more psoriasis on my head, in my ears, legs, toe nails, finger nails, etc.  I also switched to Cetiphil  to wash myself and Tide Free to wash my clothes. Completely symptom free!Years later, I developed psoriatic arthritis as that’s very common once you have the psoriasis  marker.Enbrel helped that as well.Now I have a new job and new insurance. They made me try Humira. It’s been extremely difficult for me and I’m having my worst ever flare up. I’m so sick right now. The pain in horrible!My doc is having me take steroids until I’m hopefully approved for Enbrel. I also have burning as a symptom. I feel like I’m on fire.

11,Enbrel,Psoriatic Arthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 4, 2019",22,"I was diagnosed with PA and I have no psoriatic symptoms except on the heels of my feet. I suffer from arthritic pain in my right hand (thumb mostly) and both big toes. I was prescribed Embrel and after taking the first injection (which caused extreme nausea) I was perplexed that my symptoms worsened. Now I was experiencing pain on my left hand and other places I hadn’t noticed pain before. I thought maybe I have to have a few doses before I see any relief from symptoms, so I administered a second injection and although I didn’t experience the nausea of my previous experience, I noticed no relief and a worsening of pain again, continuing to affect areas that were never painful previously. I have decided not to continue treatment.",Paolo

13,Enbrel,Psoriatic Arthritis,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 2, 2018",49,"My wife has found great relief using Enbrel for the last 5 years after she was diagnosed with aggressive psoriatic arthritis. My main complaint is the cost of a drug that was introduced 20 years ago. We were co-paying $10 every 90 days until my wife turned 65, when the debit card provided by Enbrel was cancelled. She has to sign up for a Medicare Part D plan now and her co-pay is over $4,800 a year for just that medicine, not including the monthly premiums for the Part D plan. With dual Medicare Part B and Medicare supplemental, our out of pocket cost for 2019 is $10,601, not including other deductibles, and we are healthy. Question: Why do the makers of Enbrel (Amgen) get to charge these exorbitant rates after 20 years on the market. I guess that's why they invented lobbyists.",Jim

15,Enbrel,Psoriatic Arthritis,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 11, 2017",36,I took enbrel for about 8 yrs with great satisfaction and little side effects.Then it lost its effectiveness and I changed to Humira with even better results.Now after 7 more years it appears its effectiveness is starting to wane .I'm considering going back to enbrel and trying it again hopefully with comparable results as  the first time. good luck to all and I hoped this helped someone.,Matt.
16,Enbrel,Psoriatic Arthritis,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 6, 2017",40,I took Embrel from 2004 to 2012 until it stopped working and I switched to Humira. I was on a double dose due to the severity of the arthritis- in nearly every joint. Psoriasis is mild. Enbrel was a miracle drug that took me from barely walking to 80% mobility. Still can't kneel or run but that's minor. I can WALK!!!! I had no side effects. I took it with methotrexate for 3 years and then stopped the mtx cause Enbrel was so effective. Alas the day came when Enbrel quit working but 8 years was a nice run compared to some people. Humira is almost as effective but the psoriasis was better with Enbrel. I've had PsA for 45 years and Enbrel was a God-send.,OhComeNow

It did help the joints,  quite a bit, reducing joint pain and increasing mobility.   I was able to walk up and down stairs, and started walking from 1 to 5 miles a week! ( A near miracle after 45 years with Psoriatic arthritis!!) Most of the  symptoms of Transverse myelitis, which started on another biologic and was much more severe on that previous drug went away, with the exception of  Bladder Incontinence.... made a life outside the home very difficult.  That side effect stopped within 3 days of taking Enbrel, and has not returned in the past 2 years.",ksquared

Two days after, I'm fine. I get sick easily when inconsiderate people ride public transportation sick and don't take care about coughing. Grocery shopping is another hazard as sick people run into the store ""for just a second"" and head home to be sick. Buying masks for the hazard areas is a good idea. I always ask at Drs offices for a few and have never been refuses. Even with the one day colds and the hazard if getting sick frequently, IT'S MORE THAN WORTH TAKING DUE TO BENEFITS.

My debilitating arthritis pain in my hands and wrist, knees and hips prevented me from being the best mom I could be. I could not take it anymore. I'm relatively young (38) so I had to be very proactive in my diagnosis and treatment. I was sure that I did not want to take methotrexate and wanted a biological. I did my research and knew the risks. Enbrel is a miracle for me. The pain relief was instant, within 5 hours of the first shot. It's been three months and I have full movement, minimal to no pain.

I went to the doctor who told me I have to get off I'm allergic to it and a next shot could be life threatening.

My swollen and painful hands from psoriatic arthritis quickly had no more swelling, no more pain, and the joint damage was slowed to next to nothing.  The injections can burn sometimes, but the pain was worth it.  I had insurance to cover it for a year and a half.  It is VERY expensive at almost $500 per shot.  I needed one shot per week, sometimes two.  Now, I have no insurance and my Enbrel will be running out. I am so worried about the future.
