These dmards helped but couldn’t get below 5mg of steroids or would flare and have to go back up on steroids. Rhuemy put me on cosentyx worst experience ever serious digestive issues gave me ibs.

1,Humira,Psoriatic Arthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2021",0,I did my first infusion and one week later started itching everywhere. I had a skin biopsy that confirmed drug induced allergy. I've been on high doses of steroids to counter the reaction. I'm miserable. And since humira stays in your system for up to 100 days this is going to be a fun time. Never ever again.,Jen
2,Humira,Psoriatic Arthritis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 10, 2021",2,I took my first dose of Humira (injectable pen) and one week later I have a terrible itchy rash all over my body. I went to my doctor and am waiting on biopsy results. Since I had the rash I  got a steroid injection which hasn’t touched the rash and in fact it’s spreading even more. No one can seem to tell me if this is Humira but I’ve never had a rash like this before and nothing else in my life has changed.,Jen
3,Humira,Psoriatic Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 28, 2021",3,"These pens have serious quality control issues. I started taking in mid December. Now it is the end of April. Of the last 2 batches, each with 2 pens each, 3 of them completely leaked. I followed the normal procedure which had worked first 6 times. It is very frustrating to go through this for such an expensive medicine. My insurance covers most of it. So, my monetary loss is nominal. But, if anybody is paying multiple hundreds, this would have serious psychological impact. How can you trust the medicine for such chronic and oppressive conditions when the device itself not reliable? I hate Humira and it’s manufacturer now.",Ak71

6,Humira,Psoriatic Arthritis,9.0,,"January 16, 2021",3,I have been on Humira for 3 years now for Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis. I have had Psoriasis for 35 years and PSA for about 4 years. I Started with the original formulation  (40mg) every other week. Now on Citrate free. The citrate free seems to have less irritation at the injection site and a finer needle. My Psoriasis on my skin disappeared within a few weeks except for a patch on my scalp. My joints ( especially my feet ) started to feel better within a few injections. My labs have shown low White Blood Cell counts a few times. (I do drink Alcohol ) I have not have to have any treatments of any sort. I have occasionally taken Meloxicam for occasional pain ( I am an Industrial Mechanic by trade ) so I sometimes over do it on the job. One of the side effects that I have noticed is my Allergy's seem worse. I started sneezing more often and usually have a runny nose in the morning. Allergy meds do seem to help.,Siggy

8,Humira,Psoriatic Arthritis,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 12, 2020",7,"Humira was a life saver for 7 months for my psoriatic arthritis. Then everything changed and the Adverse Reactions began — Drug Induced Lupus causing massive hair loss from scalp lesions, skin rash, mouth ulcers and thrush, and fatigue like I never knew with PSA. I‘ve never had this much hair loss, but then no other drug ever hit with such velocity before. I had fine hair but lots of it so the loss was just visible in the shower and floor at first. But it’s relentless and unending until the bald spots are unmistakable to me and others around me. It’s been 4 months since I stopped this stuff and my histone antibody for drug induced Lupus is still positive. This drug is horrible and I wish I’d never allowed the start of it. It’s like something that is dormant laying in wait to attack. And when it does, it’s devastating.",Putter

My rheumatologist gave me a sample on a Monday to inject and by Tuesday evening all my pain was gone.  A 36 hour turn around that has been working now for 3 years.

After the second injection, that evening I ended up getting horribly sick with a sinus infection. They ran everything from flu-COVID 2x and all came back negative. Couldn’t shake a a low grade fever. Then a derecho blew through and took out the power and lost my next dose. Couldn’t get ahold of my doctor to see what they wanted me to do about the injection, but no response so I stopped. I felt worse but better at the same time. Started Humira back up again and now I have been experiencing numbness, tingling, and swollen from my elbow down. I can’t grip things correctly for the loss of correct sensations. I cannot hardly sleep, no NSAID SEEMS TO HELP. Not sure what to do because the feeling started in one side over a week ago and they only upped my steroid to help for short time. Now I’m feeling it all on both sides. Help me!",Sukiyuki

17,Humira,Psoriatic Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 24, 2020",6,"I started humira last year for my psoriatic arthritis.  I saw improvements that were better than methotrexate for sure but the symptoms would show up again just before injection time.  It also cleared up my plaque psoriasis completely.  Due to financial constraints, I had to stop for a few months.  My symptoms came back with a vengeance and were far far worse than they were originally.  I’m now back on humira and am also taking methotrexate until everything is under control again.  I’m hoping it works as fast as it did the first time.  Just don’t get off of it without a back up plan....",Liz
18,Humira,Psoriatic Arthritis,4.0,,"December 19, 2019",4,"I was on Remicade for years with GREAT results, but six months ago developed a terrible case of Thrush! I stopped Remicade because I figured the candida was taking advantage of my lowered immune system. However, in September, the joint pain was so bad I felt I had to go back on medication and tried Otezla. I couldn't stay on it longer than 1 month because of terrible side effects, switched to Humira in October, but had to double the dose in December because it was not helping the joint pain. It is still not helping the joint pain, but I will persevere  for another month. I am considering going back on Remicade again because it works like a miracle with minimum side effects - other than the immune system issues. Humira affects the immune system, too, so I might as well go back on something that actually helps me!",maracel

20,Humira,Psoriatic Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 21, 2019",7,"Started noticing psoriasis at age 27, started with the head scalp plaque and progressed all over including arthritis pain. Possibly due to stress. Local climate and pollution were not helpful. Tried many medications and lotions with none to minimal success. The only relief I could get is tropical sun, beach, and sea water. That relief lasted a few months.Moving to a dry climate area helped reduce arthritis pain dramatically. And after trying Humira for the first time and so far the only biological I tried 99% was cleared with no side effects so far. On rare occasions I would get minor numbness and to reduce the risk I even took it once a month - not as prescribed. That still helped with 97% clear skin.

When it came time for me to do my injections the pain pills I were on interfered with my injections and I started getting a large swollen circle around the injection sight. My dermatologist quickly pulled me off of it and its all came back 10x worse.

I still have minor swelling in my right knee and ankles however they have improved greatly from what they were like before taking humira. Whilst the bone and cartilage damage cant be reversed  I believe humira has put a cap on my diseased parts and has halted the progression of the symptoms and hopefully is giving me more time to not have to have a knee replacement.,Fmc4rpj

For anyone considering starting it, my experience was this, I typically have plaque psoriasis on my scalp and knees, when I first started the shots I had an itchy 2-3 day rash at the injection site (This my doctor resolved by having me ice the shot site first, I recommend this to everyone) I also had guttate psoriasis spread over my thighs and sides, which thankfully went away as I said after 4 months, it was painful and snagged on my clothes, it would have been a deal breaker if it didn't go away, but it did thankfully.",K'nick
52,Humira,Psoriatic Arthritis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 8, 2016",33,I have had moderate psoriasis for about 15 years which I've managed with topicals.  It started to get worse along with me developing psoriatic arthritis all of a sudden.  I decided it was time to call on the big guns.  This stuff is pretty great!  My psoriasis cleared up in about a month and my PsA was gone pretty much instantly!  The injections are a little uncomfortable but if you let it warm up a bit and learn the tricks it's not so bad.  Small sacrifice really.  I've had no side effects other than I am a little tired after the shot so I take it right before bed.  So glad to have this medicine!  Hope it keeps working for many years to come.,corpkid
