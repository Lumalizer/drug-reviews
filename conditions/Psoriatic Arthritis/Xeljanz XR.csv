0,Xeljanz XR,Psoriatic Arthritis,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 22, 2019",6,I was on Xeljanz for 2 months. I had to quit taking it when I realized it was making me extremely depressed. My rheumatologist put me on Taltz and after a week I can already see major improvement to my psoriasis. I also have PSA and my joints are not quite as stiff. Unfortunately most medications work for me but my body builds a resistance to them after a while. This is the 8th medication I have been on for my PSA. Fingers crossed that it's the last.,Skye
1,Xeljanz XR,Psoriatic Arthritis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 8, 2019",13,"I have been taking this medication for about 6 weeks.  I am on my 4th medication for Psoriatic arthritis ( PA).  I feel worse on this medication than all the others.  I have been robbed of a whole year of my life trying all these medications.  The fatigue is so bad I cannot even go to work.  I have had a Venus doplar because they thought the tingling in my legs was a blood clot.  No, it was a side effect of the Xeljanz XR. I was put on Lasix to help with water retention due to the Xeljanz and I was even sicker.  I want to get better not add more medications that make me sicker and a whole lot more uncomfortable. I have stopped this medication and I am seriously thinking about not trying any biological.  The medication is worse than the disease.  I have been dealing with PA for about 15 years and no amount of pain is as bad as the side affects and inability to have a life.",Big Girl
