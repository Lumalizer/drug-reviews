0,Dexamethasone,Psoriatic Arthritis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 21, 2019",17,"5 years un-diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and just about gave up, no energy, so stiff could not walk across a room.  Had plaque scales covered on my entire body. Started this med, first day stiffness began leaving, energy boosted, took for one week and felt 40 years younger. Went from working in yard 3 hours a year to 30 in one week.....  Keep some on hand to take a week here and there along with my MTX med for Arthritis.",Quando62
