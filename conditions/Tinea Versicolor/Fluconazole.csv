0,Fluconazole,Tinea Versicolor,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2022",1,"I love/loathe this medication…more loathe because symptom wise it changed my taste! This is a rare side effect symptom and I’m often invalidated when speaking on it but it has made me miserable. Food tastes WEIRD to the point where only certain things taste good or can get my attention, leading to the point of unhealthy eating habits as this has been going on for last month starting the day I took it. There were some other symptoms that everyone else listed but this has been the most extreme for me. Why I  love this medication is because it completely cleared my tinea versicolor, something that has also made me miserable. This medication extremely confuses me.",Tara

3,Fluconazole,Tinea Versicolor,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 2, 2019",11,"I was prescribed fluconazole for a skin rash caused by yeast. Instructed to take two 150mg pills at the same time and if the rash doesn’t clear take same dose a week later. Well I did and had the worst reaction! Dizziness, diarrhea, dry mouth with an odd taste, racing heart, sweating/chills - I think I had an all night anxiety attack. I’ve taken this med before will very little side effects so I’m not sure what happened. It sounds like my experience is not uncommon. And my rash is still there...",RL

6,Fluconazole,Tinea Versicolor,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 15, 2015",7,"Diflucan (fluconazole):After nine years with a fungal infection on the skin, I was given 100 MG/week for a month. I already took the last pill of the course, and all it has done so far is turn the spots pink and make them slightly bigger, and some itched more often (although one looks like it's starting to disappear)!     But the side effects! Oh, the side effects! After the first pill, I felt extremely dizzy, headachy, and nauseous for an hour after bedtime. The next day, I had little appetite that only recovered that evening. The next two times, I took two Rolaids, which helped with the nausea. That left the headache to contend with all day the day after I took the pill.I took two ibuprofen three times to combat the headaches on the last pill. What a joke!",HorseToGiveYouNoPain
7,Fluconazole,Tinea Versicolor,7,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 6, 2015",6,"This is my third treatment in a year and a half. My doctor says it will probably come back every 6 months, and it has. I take 300mg !!! It clears up in a week but as prescribed I still take another dose a week after first dose.",Nicolanut
8,Fluconazole,Tinea Versicolor,6,,"December 2, 2009",14,"I was diagnosed with Tinea Versicolor.  This is basically an overgrowth of yeast on your skin, it causes the affected areas to lose pigment; such as a tan. Locals in Hawaii call it Haole rot. I'm not entirely sure if this medicine is working yet because it can take a long time for your skin tone to even out. My pharmacist did not tell me that Xanax should not be taken with this medicine. I'm really happy that I didn't take any. I can't find out how long it stays active in your system though.  I took the medicine yesterday (400mg) and I am going to take another 400mg dose in one week. Today my face burns as though I have a chemical burn. It's kind of an odd side effect.",Anonymous
