0,Testosterone,Gender Dysphoria,2,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 27, 2014",9,"Testosterone will boost your libido, and if there is any gender questioning in the background, this will bring it to the surface hard and fast. I have been on Testopel for several years and I think I received too many pellets. My T shot up to 900. I am now just starting out with a gender councilor to consider transitioning.  If you think you have gender dysphoria and are born male, please consider carefully before taking testosterone. I tried to use it to cure my Gender dysphoria and it made it much worse.",Neil---->Marissa
1,Testosterone,Gender Dysphoria,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 6, 2014",13,"Being on testosterone has completely changed my life for the better. I no longer suffer from extreme psychological distress associated with my condition. The only thing I don't like about it is having to inject myself once a week for the rest of my life. My doctor does not have the time to do it. I have thought about switching to gel but at 20x the cost, it isn't worth it. I have been on testosterone for almost 4 years and self-injecting for 3.",Cherno
