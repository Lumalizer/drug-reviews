0,Spironolactone,Gender Dysphoria,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 1, 2022",0,"Used for about a month - has made me completely stop HRT until I can get access to a different anti-androgen. I assume it suppressed my T well enough, but this comes at the cost of never getting more than a few hours of uninterrupted sleep due to constant urination and brain fog that feels worse than dysphoria dissociation. This drug will be perfect for you if your goal is to suppress T at any cost - for me, it wasn't worth the downsides.",keystothegate
1,Spironolactone,Gender Dysphoria,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 5, 2021",0,"As much as I want to stop the effects of testosterone on my body, the constant dizziness, lingering nausea, anxiety & brain fog made me stop this drug immediately. I stopped only after 4 days because it was too overwhelming and started messing with my life more than the gender dysphoria. I'm also very sensitive to all pharmaceutical drugs so I'm not too shocked by my reaction. Just very unfortunate.",Tommi

3,Spironolactone,Gender Dysphoria,,,"February 5, 2018",13,"Worked great for a while, then I started losing weight, feeling tired, trouble swallowing, etc. My GP and the multiple specialists she sent me to told me it was an eating disorder and referred me to an eating disorder clinic...honestly don't trust MOST doctors after this. It turned out Spironolactone was the cause, because when I asked the Endocrinologist(not the one that originally prescribed Spiro for me) prescribing my meds to switch me to an alternative, the side effects went away and now I'm able to eat the same portions as those around me. if this medication works for you, great. But if you do start feeling unusually tired, bloated, can't eat, cant sleep and have trouble swallowing...GET OFF OF IT! It's not worth it.",ArwenV
4,Spironolactone,Gender Dysphoria,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 18, 2013",72,"After switching from cyproterone acetate to spironolactone, I found that apart from increased urination, it works almost as well to decrease androgen levels. It does what it is supposed to, and for that, I'm very happy!",Anonymous
