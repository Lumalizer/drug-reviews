2,Estradiol,Gender Dysphoria,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 5, 2018",26,"EstrogenIt's the bestrogenMakes grow of breastrogenBut seriously, I can't recommend estradiol enough. I've been taking it sublingually for around 4 months now (2mg daily for the first 3 months, increased to 4mg last month) and I feel like an entirely different person. My skin feels so much softer (even though it's still just as dry >:( ), and I've noticed a fair bit of breast growth (they look a bit bigger but feel much different due to an increased amount of tissue), as well as more fat on my face. The one downside is the mood effects; my emotional lows are pretty low. Luckily my highs are much higher than they ever were before. I'd recommend any trans woman get on estradiol ASAP (provided they're not on it already haha)",jessnotjesse
3,Estradiol,Gender Dysphoria,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 31, 2015",37,"so i started transitioning at 18 and after a lot of research i settled on premarin as its the closest to organic estrogen. after 2 years on that i gained too much weight for myself to continue without risking blood clots or a stroke. mydoctor said ""yyou're switching to estradiol"" i was like ok. after maybe 3 weeks when my sex drive came back and my weight went wayy down i knew i had made a grave mistake years ago. this may be synthetic but its most customly fit for humans. then i started developing again. this med has changed my life for the better",Delila the Rav3n
4,Estradiol,Gender Dysphoria,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 29, 2014",47,"After spending over two decades without any treatment, I sought help for my transsexualism; my doctor first prescribed spironolactone, followed by estradiol. It took a bit of time to find the proper dose to balance my estrogen levels, but patience paid off--no negatives! With estradiol, I've finally been able to start building a life for myself!",quiet_dreamer
