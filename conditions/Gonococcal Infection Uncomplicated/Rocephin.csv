0,Rocephin,Gonococcal Infection Uncomplicated,10.0,,"October 2, 2020",6,I picked up Gonorrhea... received one shot of Ceftriaxone in combination with oral Azithromycin. The needle was huge but I didnâ€™t feel ANYTHING. Started clearing up the infection almost immediately. 12+ hours later and still no pain... there must have been a lot of Lidocaine mixed in.,Bruh
1,Rocephin,Gonococcal Infection Uncomplicated,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 2, 2017",5,"Found out I had Gonorrhea.  Doctor prescribed this and antibiotic pills pills (doxy).  The shot is NOT as painful as everyone says, especially if you take precautions:  1. Insist that the mix the shot with lidocaine, 2.  Ice it when you get home, ice it before bed.  I got it in the left arm and I was rock climbing the next day.Symptoms decreased significantly 6 hours after the shot.",DrippyPeepee
