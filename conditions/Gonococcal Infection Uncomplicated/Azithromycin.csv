1,Azithromycin,Gonococcal Infection Uncomplicated,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 27, 2019",0,"I took the azithromycin tablets 5 hours ago. I’ve been to the toilet 3 times and have some stomach cramps. I don’t feel sick. Just gassy. I wouldn’t say I’m in a lot of pain, I have some cramps but feel fine in myself (if a little more tired) ... but nothing major.I ate about 2/3 hours before hand. Had a nap about an hour afterwards and woke up like this. I’ve eaten some peanut butter and bread, had some water and hoping it settles now.5 hours in and I’m presuming/hoping this will be my only side effect. If it removes the infection I’m 100% fine with a few side effects.",Nn

3,Azithromycin,Gonococcal Infection Uncomplicated,,,"December 14, 2017",0,"Okay.I found this website after taking pills.I have a massive anxiety when it comes to medicine as I had severe allergy reactions. So, I was prescribed 8 x 250mg to treat Gonorrhea. I took each pill every 15mins, and last 3 pills I took together.After like 20mins I was throwing up with a massive pain.I can’t remember last time I felt so sick. Now I’m writing this while sitting on the toilet with a worst diarrhoea in my whole life. Been 15mins already. And it’s second time.So took it around 4pm, now its 9pm and  feel like I'm dying. I feel weak, dizzy.. but I guess lesson learned in a hard way.:) Hopefully I’m not gonna need to tale them again. Experience was worst I’ve ever had.",Beepingo
4,Azithromycin,Gonococcal Infection Uncomplicated,10.0,,"February 20, 2017",3,"Okay so I was reading all these reviews and got so worked up and scared to take them, everyone saying they had nausea and diarrhea and I was so scared to take them. But I took them an hour ago after eating a good meal, I took them with sprite and have been eating a snack, still am feeling fine, not drowsy or anything. I was scared for nothing.",anon no name needed
5,Azithromycin,Gonococcal Infection Uncomplicated,9.0,,"April 4, 2016",5,"My ""faithful"" boyfriend of 4 years passed on this horrible infection. We both got tested at the start of our relationship and both results came back negative. After going through weeks of pain while urinating and a sore throat I decided to get tested. I was prescribed a single dose of 4 250mg tablets of azithromycin and 2 200mg tablets of suprax. I was advised to take the dose evenly throughout the day, 1 hour before food. I took each dose 1 hour after each other and ate something small inbetween. I had no pain in my belly, no upset stomach or any of the common symptoms but for 24 hours later i had a mild ringing in both ears. I got retested 2 weeks later and everything had cleared up and the discomfort eased the day after i took the tabs.",AIJRISH
