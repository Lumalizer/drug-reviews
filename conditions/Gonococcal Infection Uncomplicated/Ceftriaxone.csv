0,Ceftriaxone,Gonococcal Infection Uncomplicated,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 22, 2021",1,My boyfriend gave me gonorrhea. I went to get treatment and received an injection of rocephin in my arm. I'm usually good with needles BUT this was one of the most painful injections I've ever received in my life. Especially the second after they remove the needle. I felt like my soul come out of my body in agonizing pain! I started to have tremors and the doctor kept asking me if i was okay but I couldn't take the pain anymore. I didn't scream or anything I held it down I guess thats why it hurts so much more! I think if you get it in the butt it will hurt less. But this stuff hurts and I am not joking! hoping it works. STAY SAFE GUYS,Veriy

The needle was huge but I didnâ€™t feel ANYTHING. Started clearing up the infection almost immediately. 12+ hours later and still no pain... there must have been a lot of Lidocaine mixed in.,Bruh
