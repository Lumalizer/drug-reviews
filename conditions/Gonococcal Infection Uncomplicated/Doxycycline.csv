1,Doxycycline,Gonococcal Infection Uncomplicated,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 2, 2017",4,"Found out I had Gonorrhea, was afraid of the nausea from Azithromycin, so I took 7 days of twice a day doxycycline, worked like a charm.  I never got bloated or nausea or diarrhea, BUT I took lots of supplementary probiotics and I limited dairy and caffeine, a lot.    Symptoms were gone by day 2, but that was because of the Rocephin Shot.  Enjoy!",VeryDrippyPeePee
