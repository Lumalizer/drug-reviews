0,Botox,Urinary Frequency,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 14, 2022",1,"Getting Botox for OAB was the worst decision I ever made.  My life is exponentially worse right now. Prior to the procedures, I had frequent urination and had to go 4-5 times a night on average.  I tried the Botox the first time and I think I had one night where I only woke up twice.  The worst effect was the retention; the inability to go, knowing I had a full bladder.  They said ""you have to do it again for it to really work"" so I did.  I now get up 8-9 times at night, can't empty bladder and have the worst pain all night long.  I would give anything to go back in time and not have this done.",Anonymous

If it weren’t for worrying about what would become if my dogs - well, suicide seemed a fairly good option.  After trying different medications, my urologist (my hero, he should wear a cape) suggested trying the bladder Botox injections.  Only two days after the procedure I got to put on real panties !

I would literally get up nearly every hour of the night with an urge to urinate even the tiniest amount. It was a nightmare. My urologists tried every form of treatment on me with no success. Here is the very effective course of treatment I have found only after 3 years of constant trial and error.  At bed time I take the following: 1.Trazadone 50 or 100 mg,2.Gabapentin 300mg, 3.Melatonin 5mg      I tried Botox injections to the bladder. I had it done 3 times. The first dose of 100 ml really seemed to help in that it allowed me to sleep for an amazing 2 hours at a time without having to get up to pee. However, once the first dose wore off the two subsequent dosed did nothing even though we doubled the dose to 200 ml!",gaeliccouple

I was on 3 different antibiotics while in the hospital. Then after 7 days in the hospital  then still had to come home on 2 weeks  more of levaquin which is dangerous in itself.

My bladder holds 50-70ml.Needed catheter to give me some rest. Went home with indwelling catheter. No antibiotics before or after botox. 2 weeks later now 2-3 bags of blood each day in bag. No visibility in bag due to blood and stringy clots 4 days in a row. Told nothing to worry about at local hospital, antibiotics injected and got tablets for bladder infection.

I live with them and we so regret it!!!  Maybe more problems because of his age?  He came home in horrible pain and threw up for 2 days.  He was going a lot more and so sick and in so much pain after 5 days -we took him to the emergency room.  They put in a catheter until he could go to his Dr Monday about 50 miles.  They took the Cath out and he can't go at all now!.  Then we heard from my other brother in law tell us about  having it done also a few months ago.  Very painful and he will never do it again.  The Drs didn't seem truthful about what might happen and the horrible pain.  We hope his bladder will start working again.  Drs should have to share percents of problems from this! My 2 family members wish they never had it done.  Is it worth the odds of it helping or the potential life changing side effects!??,Sad regretful family member

Disappointing would be a understatement. I would have taken catheterizing over the constant urge to pee in a heartbeat. I read a study somewhere that said it was much more effective for older people, in their 40s and up, than younger people. I wish allergan would look further into this to figure out why.

I decided to try the botox so I would not have a problem on my trip.  Actually if I had read some of the horror stories on this blog, then I probably would have opted out.  I am glad that I had it done.  The procedure was painful.  Then the twinges afterwards were like mild labor contractions for about 12 hours.  Tylenol helped a lot.  I told my husband that I would never have it done again.  After the initial twinges and a few days it worked, and it has been amazing for 6 1/2 months, and it is still working.  I feel free from rushing to the bathroom.  I am now just wondering when it will wear off.  I will definitely be doing it again and just taking Tylenol that first day.  Just know that it hurts, then it cramps for a while, but to me it is so worth it.  I am hoping I can go without another treatment for 8 or 9 months.",snookie

I wasn’t having any problems with leaking or peeing on myself it was just the urgency I was having to get up during the night up to 10 or even more. Anyways like I said I’m on day three and I definitely feel a lot of relief from the sense of urgency and my doctor said that it could take up to two weeks for the full effects to work so I am super hopeful that it will get even better than it already has overall I’m really glad I got this treatment I hope this helps,Shayster

Did you not read any of the literature on this procedure? Did your doctor not explain what the Botox was doing to/for you? You are paralyzing your bladder muscles, i.e. they may not work at all or very well after, causing retention. This is why the literature states that if you are not prepared/willing to Cath after, don't do it!

My injections wereworst case scenario as I owed out the lidocaine. Out of 20 injections I didn't feel 10 at all. The other 10 hurt but it was fast and 48 hours later my life had changed. I highly recommend this but do research on your urologist. How many does he/she do? What's the rate of needing a straight cath post procedure? What's his/her failure rate? Find someone good and then do it of nothing else worked. Life changing!,Tissa

146,Botox,Urinary Frequency,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 25, 2015",68,"I agreed to a Botox injection to treat frequent urination when all other treatments failed.  Since the Botox injection I have the urge to urinate almost all the time.  When I can pass small amounts of urine the pressure is often still present and urgency sometimes returns in as little as 20 minutes. Sometimes I cannot pass any urine. Even when I can pass urine, about 150 to 200 cc remains in the bladder and I have to use catheters. I have to stay close to a restroom all the time. I was told the Botox would wear off after a year but here I am about a year after the Botox injection and I'm still using catheters to empty my bladder as often as needed. There has not been any noticeable change. I'm beginning to think that my bladder functions will never return to at least as good as before the Botox injections. What a huge mistake. What a gullible victim I've been.",rqmonty

I was my doctors first patient to receive the treatment.  I am so grateful for this option.  Before Botox I could not go far from home.
