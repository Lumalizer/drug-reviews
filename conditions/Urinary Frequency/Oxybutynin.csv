1,Oxybutynin,Urinary Frequency,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 15, 2022",1,This was prescribed as an alternative to Myrbetriq due to expense and increased blood pressure when I tried sample for a few weeks.  Initially it seemed to help with frequency but it was short lived.  I continued to give it a try for 2 months but the side effects of stomach pain and gas worsened in addition to weakness and I had to stop.  I would not recommend if you have any stomach sensitivity.,No relief

For me it causes really bad dizziness, and blurred vision and my eyes don't focus like they should, it also causes me to feel spaced out and it effects my cognitive function, I've had really bad short term memory with this drug, and the dry eyes and dry mouth are horrible.

No burning, but cramps like a period and sex is terribly painful. Haven't been to the doctor yet but I think I know what's going on, as a nurse, I've seen this. Struggled for months. I put the patch on yesterday, not even 24 hrs and I feel 80% better. I still feel it, but not near how I did. And if it gets better from here that would be amazing!    I recommend this patch highly, maybe I should have waited a few days to post this, but the fact that I feel this good already needed to be shared. Worth every penny, and if you think about it, it is not that expensive. I usually get skin irritation from patches, and it's a little itchy already but weighing out the pros and cons, who cares about itchy skin! Now if it blisters I'll be SOL. but for now I have hope.

7,Oxybutynin,Urinary Frequency,3.0,,"July 31, 2021",1,"I'm an octogenarian and have had no urination problems until the beginning of 2021.  By July I was getting up once or twice a night and urinating a total of 8 times in 24 hours. I was put on 5 mg oxybutynin pill twice a day, in mid July, which seemed to exacerbate the problem to 2 to 3 urinations at night and a total of 10 to 12 times in 24 hours. The doc increased the dosage to 10mg twice a day and told me to call him to see how it goes.  It seemed counter intuitive to me, but I decided to try it. I see no improvement, but today I got a scare when I was having a sandwich and apple for lunch and had difficulty swallowing and digesting. I chewed well but the food, especially the apple, seems to be clogged up in my thorax area, as well as in the pit of my stomach area. It took about half an hour before I felt that my food was digested. I not only got dry mouth, but it seemed like my entire system was dry, as I kept sipping water at lunch. I was greatly concerned that I would choke.",jonab

12,Oxybutynin,Urinary Frequency,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 1, 2021",1,"I was on this medication for OAB and urinary frequency particularly at nighttime. On this I was able to ‘hold it’ longer rather than needing to rush to the nearest bathroom, but the urge was still there if that makes sense. At night time the urge (it must be habit now) would be there to go, and I’ve recently found that my urinary frequency may be directly linked to my anxiety, so instead I am being treated for that. It works and it’s worth a try, but I experienced grogginess and a very dry mouth to the point where I did feel quite sick because of it. I’d take these tablets on days where I’d have exciting things planned, but I’d be too tired and grumpy when it came to actually doing them! But I’m sure it’s different for everyone. I understand this medication was not right for me because it wasn’t treating the actual problem I have.

I started with a 5mg extended-release tablet and went to 10mg to see if it was more effective. I haven't been on the higher dose long enough to know if it increases the effectiveness or not, all I know is that there has been an improvement since I started taking it, but I still have times when the urgency is strong, just not as strong.

The urgency was very annoying and affecting my work and my life.  These reviews were all very helpful, and I referred back to them when I got depressed. My Dr. said to first try Kegels, or muscle exercises.  Those weren’t the easiest to learn so I just skipped them and used the patch.  I would have given it a 5 at that point, however, it was an improvement. The past 2 weeks I worked on the kegel exercises working from 2 seconds up to 10 seconds—10 reps, 3times a day and would now give the patch a 9. I believe the combination of the patch and exercises work best for me.  As far as the sticky residue it far outweighs the problem. I agree with those that say 3 days works better than 4.  This past week has been the best because I’ve only felt the urge when I needed to use the bathroom. These reviews have all been very helpful.",Denver

I am having trouble trying to get four days out of a patch as they get very brittle and bubble up. I try not to let them get wet in shower but clothing  lifts it too. I guess they need to work on the kind of plaster to use that stays put on the skin.

There's a component in this medication that's called anticholinergic which is found in antidepressants, epilepsy tablets, etc. My major side effect was that I had fallen into a deep depression, got help but nothing worked. Then I realised, it must be these tablets. So I took a risk and stopped them.

While it seems to help the spasms it seems to make it harder to be able to start voiding. Like it relaxes it almost to much, when I try harder to void it just leads to a spasm.

I had dry mouth, dry skin and unusually dry and cracked fingertips, gas, loose bowels, heartburn, bloating and burping.
