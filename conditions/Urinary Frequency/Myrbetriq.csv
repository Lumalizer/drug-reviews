It was totally useless.  I wish I could give a more favorable rating, but this drug simply did not work for me.It is also very expensive at $319 for a month's supply after my insurance made their contribution.",Jack
1,Myrbetriq,Urinary Frequency,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 14, 2022",0,My Urologist gave me samples of 50mg Myrbetriq for urinary frequency. Thank God for samples because this med is $500 a month where I live. I'm on blood pressure meds as well. I've been taking the Myrbetriq for a week and for the last 2 days I have felt horrible. When I checked by blood pressure it was 20+ points higher than usual. I'm not gonna be taking this anymore. It did however help with the stress incontinence issue and feeling like I needed to go every 30 minutes.,Michelle
2,Myrbetriq,Urinary Frequency,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 4, 2022",0,I’ve been taking Myrbetriq for only two weeks but my urinary symptoms are significantly worse. I used to sleep through the night but now wake up once or twice to urinate. I have both stress incontinence and urgency and both are far worse in the last two weeks.

I was taking 25 mg maybe once a week and did not figure out that it was causing my migraines, Irritability was an understatement, dry mouth to the point my tongue was cracking, anxiety is horrific. I can’t eat because I feel nauseous all the time. It has been five days since I have taken one and still am sick. I have horrible ringing in my ears still anxiety, backache and can’t even look at food still. I have never had side affects with any drugs in my life. This has been so bad for me. It truly is a nightmare. I still had more side affects that I did not even list. As I said day five off and still feel like horrific! NIGHTMARE!",Kayla
4,Myrbetriq,Urinary Frequency,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 18, 2022",0,I have been taking Myrbetriq for 4 days and it is like a miracle.  I feel normal again.  I noted that the price is high but the pharmacy that belongs to my insurance carrier has a cost of less that $150 for 90 days.  I did not know that something like this exists.  I have no side effects and my dosage is 50mg.,Murray

6,Myrbetriq,Urinary Frequency,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 16, 2021",0,"Mybetric has been a miracle drug for my  34 year old with severe overactive bladder, It allowed her to leave the bathroom. It worked great. The issue came in fighting the insurance company to allow her to take it. It is pricey for me to afford to buy it for her. Now that it is approved to use for Over active bladder, we have to re apply every 6 months. It never goes smoothly. Right now she has been off of it for a month. Every time she goes off waiting for approval, she gets severe cramping and pain also when she goes back on. Being off also creates havoc with her Addison's Desease as not being able to retain fluid throws off her electrolytes and blood pressure. We can't wait for her to be able to be back on it because it so greatly improves her life. Nothing else works like mybetric however after being off and on so many times it isn't working as well as it once did. She now takes mybetric during the day and another bladder control to get the night. Whole other issue for insurance co.",Mom of S.

8,Myrbetriq,Urinary Frequency,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 7, 2021",0,"I was given Myrbetriq after I had surgery for a prolapsed bladder & other reconstructive surgeries. I was give 50 mg immediately . The surgery really didn't work that well for me. Moving on, it hasn't helped me at all!! I am up at least 3- 4 x's a night & running to the bathroom all day. I now have to strain to get the urine to flow & I am not emptying out.  I've been taking it for about 3 weeks.  I've experienced bad headaches & blurry eyes. The worst part has been the insomnia.  I looked up the side effects & found that insomnia plus the other symptoms I described are very common.  I am awake most nights from 11:pm 'til 3-4 am or later every night. I took it again this am but will stop tomorrow.  Thanks for listening!!",Irene
9,Myrbetriq,Urinary Frequency,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 13, 2021",0,"I'm a 43 yrs old female. Took Myrbetriq 50 mg for 2 weeks only and had to stop it. My urologist had gave me 4 free weeks to try it. He is still trying to figure out why I'm unable to empty my bladder fully and he thinks my sensation of bladder fullness is a symptom of OAB. So, he prescribed Myrbetriq. Since day one, the med eliminated the sensation of my bladder being full all the time, which reduced the number of times I felt I needed to go to the restroom to pee considerably. However, I started developing terrible side effects that did not have before: headache, abdominal pain at nights that did not allow me to sleep, constipation, back pain, dizziness. This medicine is expensive and my insurance does not cover it.  Due to the terrible side effects and given the uncertainty that this medicine is what I need to help me void better, I decided to discontinue this med and wait for my doctor to prescribe something different for me.",Maddie

Side effects were inflamed vagina just sitting or standing in general and when I urinated and a sharp pain too. I got checked both at my doctor, ER, & gynecologist for any UTI or BV nothing and the pain just tearful like legit crying in pain. They gave me pills at the ER that flush out my urine forgot name but some type of antibiotics I think and it changes your urine color and poop...but still to this day like a month later If I hold in my bladder for a little all these side effects start. Will be talking to my doctor etc about this. How long does it take until the medication get out of my system is my question. Its beyond painful! It is an awful pill if you ask me!

15,Myrbetriq,Urinary Frequency,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 12, 2021",5,"This drug gave me a myriad of side effects including bouts of greatly increased urination which landed me in the ER after having been on it for three weeks. Had blood and urine tests done and since the doctors could not explain this, I was released and stuck it out with the drug. After five weeks on it, I started experiencing extreme vaginal pain (while on vacation!) accompanied by a real effort to urinate and when I did, it was painful! Finally, a super awesome gyn realized it was the Myrbetriq and I got off it, these and other unexplained symptoms dissipated. I believe that because it's supposed to stop frequent urination, after a certain amount of time, it builds up in your system and dries up everything. The pain was horrific. You have to rate the medication so I had to give it a 1 but my real rating is minus a million. Ladies, especially, beware of this one! I've since taken special note of foods and beverages that trigger OAB and it's really helping.",Natasha
16,Myrbetriq,Urinary Frequency,8.0,,"July 7, 2021",0,I was skeptical when I first started this medication. I was having to go constantly. I had strong urge to go 24/7 and couldn’t sleep. Been taking myrbetriq for over a year now and it has improved my life greatly. I still feel that I have to go a lot but the intensity is at a one instead of a five.,Azguy
17,Myrbetriq,Urinary Frequency,1.0,,"March 21, 2021",25,"My primary doctor recommended Oxybutynin for one month and said if no improvement in my evening frequency, I should see a urologist. So there was no improvement and the urologist prescribed Myrbetriq (50mg). The evening after the 4th pill, I could not pee at all and had to be rushed to emergency where they installed a catheter to empty my bladder that was ready to explode. I thought I was going to die until that put me on the catheter. I was on the catheter at home for 5 days suffering from the pain that the catheter was causing me. When the urologist removed the catheter, he did not know that urinary blockage was one of the side effects which really surprised me. I told him that before seeing him I had read some patient on Myrbetrig forums saying that the drug caused urinary blockages. He poo pooed the reason for their blockage and said they must have been prone to blockage rather than due to taking Mybetrig. I strongly disagree with his assessment.",David

I asked if I could be put on highest dosage right away and she agreed. What I don’t understand is everyone here talks like it is supposed to work right away when I was told it can take up to 3 months before it starts working. The Dr. Told me this. So I’m confused. As awful as frequent urination and feelings of it is  hearing about 3 months was disappointing. It takes so long with all the meds one has to try, not knowing if any work. What a waste of time and money. Horrible thing to have. I’m almost wishing they did all the procedures first.",Joots

21,Myrbetriq,Urinary Frequency,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2021",11,"I took 25mg for a couple weeks with no problem, but no noticeable results. My doctor put me on 50g Myrbetriq. I slept through the night. That was my first full nights sleep in 2 years. I would wake up almost every hour to visit the bathroom. For 3 days I was positively in heaven taking 50mg Myrbetriq, but I was having side affects, each day more noticeable side affects. On the third day, my atrial fibrillation was severe, sore neck,  pounding headache and earache. My blood pressure rose and my vision burred so bad I went to my doctor, who sent me to another eye doctor. By the end of the third day I was scheduled for eye surgery. 50mg Myrbetriq works, but were my side effects all a coincidence or real side affects?

The meds seemed to work. I was now sleeping 4-5 hours without having to get up. What I didn't know is how expensive this drug is. Even with discounts, GoodRx, etc., cost was over $400 for 30 pills. There is no generic and like many of the big pharma's in the United States they can charge just about whatever they want. I wound up ordering the pills from Canada for $100 for 30 pills. My doctor wrote me a prescription for 90 pills so my cost was just slightly over $300. It was easy and took about 2 weeks for delivery from Canada. Too bad that big pharma in the US owns the politicians and can charge whatever they want.",Ghee
23,Myrbetriq,Urinary Frequency,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 31, 2020",8,I started take this medicine because I would bad pressure on my bottom when I stand up doing anything. Then since I have a lot of health issues I am on 13 different medicines which caused me to urinate on myself in the day and while I was sleeping. My bladder would hurt so bad that I would buy AZO cranberry pills to help with some relief but then that stop working at all. But after the 3rd day of being on this medicine I notice that I was not waken up trying to make it to the bathroom and the pressure was gone.

I was totally puzzled as to what had happened until I read the side effects and reviews on this medication. Since I already take two medications  one for high blood pressure and one for heart palpitations this medication was awful to me. Before I read the reviews I did call my doctor and talk to the nurse and she never mentioned that I should be careful taking this medication but I won’t take it ever again.

When I was first prescribed Myrbetriq, I was elated. It instantly stopped my frequent and incomplete trips to the bathroom, intense bladder pain, peeing when sneezing or coughing, and waking up to pee at night. I sung its praises to everyone I knew that had similar issues.  However, only 5 months later, it has completely stopped working all together. Every symptom is back. Not only that, I have been experiencing massive hair loss (clumps come out in the shower) and migraines that last for days. I didn’t even think to relate it to the drug until I was reading similar accounts on here. My quick review: it’s great until it stops working, and then the side effects outweigh the benefits.

Slowly it started to stop working as well, I had a UTI and now I have a pounding headache, my ears buzz, I am so dizzy I am afraid to take a shower, my nose runs steadily, my eyes burn. I can’t concentrate maybe because I feel as if my head will explode. I see my doctor tomorrow. Hopefully she will come up with a good alternative and I won’t have withdrawal from this med.

It had gotten to the point of having a constant urge to go when lying down, so I was getting very little sleep and turning into a zombie. I tried Saw Palmetto, which actually helped for about 3 months, but then the symptoms came back with a fury. I finally went to a urologist, who put me on Flomax. That only lasted a week before the horrible side effects kicked in. After reading reviews I talked the doctor into trying Cialis 5 mg. I took that for 2 months and it had zero effect. The doctor then gave me a 2 week sample of Myrbetriq 50mg. Within a few days my stream had improved and the constant urge to go when lying down disappeared.

Constipation was deciding factor to stop taking it today, and not being able to empty my bladder. Maybe my urologist will put me on lower dose because it was working. I had an occasional headache, I can deal with that. Others may have minimal side effects, and that's great. However, I didn't, I had many with 50mg.

Background:  69 year-old male.  Had overactive bladder episodes once or twice daily.  Urinary Incontinence with minor leakage once a week, and major leakage once a month.   I sought help because of a group vacation trip with concern about finding restrooms with short notice.Good results have continued since returning.  Also  my awakening at night to urinate has been reduced by one.  From twice to maybe three times to, currently, once or twice per night.  Some nights zero!I have not experienced any side effects.  No change in metabolism, sleepiness, or bowel habits.  Good! As recommended by my Urologist, I reduced my coffee consumption.  I went from 20 ounces (2 mugs) each morning to 15 ounces.  That has helped.  No other coffee for the rest of the day.  My urologist would like to see me drink zero coffee, but that is not going to happen!",Guido
