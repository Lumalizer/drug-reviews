0,Ditropan,Urinary Frequency,1.0,,"September 29, 2020",13,"I got put on Ditropan for over active bladder. I had bladder pain a lot too. It helped with not having to have to go pee all the time. The side effect would give me actual contraction as if I was in the early stages of labor. And my back next to my kidneys would be so painful, it would radiate to my stomach. the pain was extreme. I went to the hospital to get checked out. Luckily I was fine nothing was a wrong. I had to stop taking the medicine",whenne

7,Ditropan,Urinary Frequency,8.0,,"February 1, 2016",22,Started using ditropan (5mg) 3 days ago. On day one I took it with breakfast and noticed that post-shower while drying my hair (and straightening) it I didn't have a bead of sweat in sight! This dosage and medicine type has definitely kept me dry all-day long since then. I do however still sweat quite a bit at the gym but once I am done exercising I am no longer sweating at all (I would usually sweat quite a bit after the gym). I am giving it an 8/10 because it seems to wear off near the end of the day but I may just need to up the dosage a tiny bit.,ARrrrr

10,Ditropan,Urinary Frequency,6.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 21, 2013",79,"It definitely helps with ""urgency"" - I can now hang on for a while (up to an hour), whereas before I had to go immediately. My main concern with it is a feeling of vagueness and slight difficulty focusing mentally, starting around an hour after I take it and lasting 2-3 hours. It seems to be increasing. I am concerned enough about this that I am considering stopping Ditropan. Another side effect is a dry mouth. I need to have frequent sips of water, and the dryness wakes me up 2-3 times a night.",Female 49yo

12,Ditropan,Urinary Frequency,,,"April 11, 2012",40,Using for bladder problems (inflexible bladder muscles). Lengthens the time between needing to go and stops the spasms while trying to hold on.
