0,Solifenacin,Urinary Frequency,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 26, 2022",0,"Night one: Shaky legs at first, but slept through out the night.   I have pelvic floor disorder.  I will take it as needed.  Still little bit of urine each time I pee at times, but to have not as much bladder pressure during the day and slept throughout the night was so thankful.  Saw stars when bent down in morning, probably affecting my blood pressure. Took it around 10:15pm was up since 5:40am for work.  I feel it’s a miracle drug because I was so miserable before with the CONSTANT BLADDER PRESSURE and WAKING UP to not COMPLETELY empty my bladder.  So far side affects are feeling tired, shaky legs, and seeing stars (low blood pressure).  I couldn’t stand my constant waking up and bladder pressure so I took medicine which I normally don’t do cause of side effects.This is a REAL review.  To notice improvement in just one dose 5mg, seems amazing.  I was hugely constipated, but there’s always fleet enemas, although not sure if you can take with this medicine?",Anonymous

Coincidentally, as soon as I began to take this medication I began to experience flare ups daily. These flare ups were HORRIBLE flare ups and worse than I have ever felt before. I blame it on this medication since it is the only ""new"" thing right now. I put two and two together and got off the medicine after a few weeks of consumption.
