2,Tolterodine,Urinary Frequency,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 22, 2021",2,"I was diagnosed with overactive bladder early August and started 2mg dose for one week with no effect then up to 4mg for the last 11 days & I can’t say I feel any difference.  Sadly, I still have this constant urge to pee & really not sure if I actually need to pee or not.   Pharmacists says the bladder remains functional & I should feel the « real » need to pee when required.  Maybe I can’t fully empty my bladder?

I suffer bouts of I.C. and can honestly say that this has saved me! I was curled-up in agony on the sofa for days on end, not able to function at all or even walk without pain. This drug gave me my life back. Yes, it does cause dry mouth and eyes (and I already have Sjogren's) but the pain subsided the same day I started taking it. I have lupus and fibro too, so am very wary of taking any type of drug, so just take it in half-doses. I am weaning off after less than a week now but will keep it handy for any future problems. I.C. pain is BRUTAL so this is amazing. It can also cause headache, but this is manageable if you keep well hydrated.",lulubear3
