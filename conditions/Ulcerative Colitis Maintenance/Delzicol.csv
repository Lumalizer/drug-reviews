0,Delzicol,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 3, 2018",7,"I've used this drug for several years.  It was first prescribed under the name Asacol.  Delzicol is exactly the same drug but is delivered in a different capsule.  I suspect that before the patent expires April 13, 2020, the greedy pharmaceutical company will find a new method to deliver the same drug thereby killing any chance of a generic becoming available.  I'm fortunate to have a Medicare plan that covers this drug with a $45.00 copay.  However when I reach the donut hole at the end of the year, the copay is close to $400.  But even that beats the price of over $600.00 retail.  The good news is that the drug does work for me.  I hope others are relieved as well.",Carol
