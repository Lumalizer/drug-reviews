0,Mesalamine,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 5, 2021",2,"Pentasa (mesalamine):Been on Pentasa for a couple of years. Everything great.

1,Mesalamine,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,6.0,,"March 12, 2021",21,"Salofalk (mesalamine):I've used both the Salofalk Foam &  the liquid Salofalk enema & recommend trying this if you are struggling. It takes longer to administer, but is easier to keep in.If you're having issues with the foam, I recommend the following:- Make sure to release the foam slowly. It's less of a shock to the system & helps reduce that reflex muscle action that makes you want to evacuate it.- Wait at least 30 secs before the 2nd dose otherwise you just feel too full when the 2nd dose is released.- After the 2nd dose, don't withdraw the nozzle immediately. Wait at least 30 secs. When you withdraw it, do so as fast as possible. This stops any residual foam coming into contact with (for want of a better word) your anus & causing a burning sensation.-  Finally  it doesn't say this on the foam instructions, consider lying on your left side for 30 mins after your treatment. This helps the foam get to where it needs to go & makes it easier to keep in.Hope this helps someone & good luck!",GT
2,Mesalamine,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 5, 2020",1,I think that the mesalamine from Mylan was totally ineffective - it is the M1200 version. My pharmacy switched me over to this from Lialda without my permission.  3 months later I had a serious UC (Ulcerative Colitis) flareup without any other conditions that would have caused that.,Jonesie
3,Mesalamine,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 27, 2020",7,"I've been on mesalamine for a week for  Microscopic colitis. My bathroom runs have increased to 20 times a day. I can't sleep because when I lay down it is bathroom time!  I've been so exhausted I have been sleeping an average of 12 hours a day and I have a constant headache. Add on a bit of a fever and my butt feels like someone blowtorched it.   The meds are worse than the disease for me right now so I am going to try steroids though they are bank-breaking.  If it actually helps, better than mesalamine, worth it",Djt
4,Mesalamine,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 14, 2020",3,"Generic Mesalamine helps reduce my UC symptoms.   Spicy foods, fatty foods, alcohol and especially stress cause outbreaks.  Mesalamine acts to coat the bowel and makes passing waste more smooth and less of an ordeal.  I don't know of any side effects. I also use generic Gas Relief (found at Kroger) containing Simethicone 180 mg.  This helps reduce the horrid smell of flatulence during an attack,  Combined with a careful diet, calming your mind and normal sleep,  Mesalamine can be most effective.  And it's not costly.

Even as I’m writing this my jaws hurt, I can’t focus, don’t wanna talk and I’m avoiding doing my homework and I have a 3 hour class to go to!Maybe I’m an exception to the common side effects.

After a year on it my colitis was non-detectable and I was put on 2.4 gm/daily for maintenance.I've been taking this medication for over 10 years now with no complications or side effects.  I've have had occasional flare-ups and simply increased the dosage back to the original 4.8 gm/daily until the symptoms cleared (usually within a week).

11,Mesalamine,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 14, 2019",17,Mesalamine did absolutely nothing for me but I’m sure it put some extra money into my doctor’s pocket. I told my sister (who is a teacher) about my colitis and the medication the doctor put me on. She told me to drink dandelion root tea because it’s a probiotic.... CLEARED IT UP COMPLETELY IN ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF. I drank it everyday during that time. I had been bleeding for a whole year before the tea (even during the lialda).,DownWithBigPharma19

So for me at least the very high dose or what they call a therapeutic level is  unnecessary.   I’m in a maintenance space  where I honestly only need it every other day,  I usually get the beginnings of a migraine about an hour after I take it but the migraine doesn’t become full blown on the lesser dose but the medicine does it’s job.  Looks like my UC became Crohn’s over time because I also have irritation in my mouth and all sorts of skin spots (look like bug bits but aren’t) and interestingly when I have a flare of any kind if I take two single pills for two days in a row it almost always goes away.   Thought I’d say it because the higher doses are completely intolerable for me but I don’t really need it like that.  I use the co-pay assist card which makes a big difference",Llgrrrrll
17,Mesalamine,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 3, 2018",7,"Delzicol (mesalamine):I've used this drug for several years.  It was first prescribed under the name Asacol.  Delzicol is exactly the same drug but is delivered in a different capsule.  I suspect that before the patent expires April 13, 2020, the greedy pharmaceutical company will find a new method to deliver the same drug thereby killing any chance of a generic becoming available.  I'm fortunate to have a Medicare plan that covers this drug with a $45.00 copay.  However when I reach the donut hole at the end of the year, the copay is close to $400.  But even that beats the price of over $600.00 retail.  The good news is that the drug does work for me.  I hope others are relieved as well.",Carol

I found out about Asacol from a medical journal (I was a nurse.)  I asked if I could start taking it as I'd given up on the Sulphazalazine. Within weeks I had no symptoms. I stayed on it for 2 years. I was lucky as I had 18 years with no problems. In 2004 it came back - but it was mild. I saw my GP who prescribed Pentasa and my gut went wild.
