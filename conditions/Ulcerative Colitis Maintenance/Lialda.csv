0,Lialda,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 19, 2019",26,"I’ve tried taking Lialda 1.2g several times in a 3 months time frame. It really seems to help with my ulcerative colitis. It improved my diarrhea (7/10) and stomach pain (8/10). It pretty much does it’s job of keeping me in remission.But,Every time I take this, my mood changes, my jaws and cheek hurt, I can’t speak properly, I can’t focus, and I just don’t feel like doing anything.At first I thought it was all in my head (pigeon superstition). And so I experimented with it about 6 times and it happened every single time. Even as I’m writing this my jaws hurt, I can’t focus, don’t wanna talk and I’m avoiding doing my homework and I have a 3 hour class to go to!Maybe I’m an exception to the common side effects. I think it’s worth writing this review just in case someone else have the similar side effects.",Made a mistake!

2,Lialda,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,10.0,,"May 17, 2018",7,"I have been taking Lialda for years and  it works but here’s the thing I also get migraines to a ridiculous degree so I was forced to cut back my dose.   So for me at least the very high dose or what they call a therapeutic level is  unnecessary.   I’m in a maintenance space  where I honestly only need it every other day,  I usually get the beginnings of a migraine about an hour after I take it but the migraine doesn’t become full blown on the lesser dose but the medicine does it’s job.  Looks like my UC became Crohn’s over time because I also have irritation in my mouth and all sorts of skin spots (look like bug bits but aren’t) and interestingly when I have a flare of any kind if I take two single pills for two days in a row it almost always goes away.   Thought I’d say it because the higher doses are completely intolerable for me but I don’t really need it like that.  I use the co-pay assist card which makes a big difference",Llgrrrrll
3,Lialda,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,,,"December 3, 2014",27,"Have had colitis for 20 years and been on mesalamine for all of it. Asacol was inconvenient because 6 pills throughout the day was hard to do. Lialda is very expensive even with insurance and their card, but it works and it's only two pills a day. The dietary changes and medication are worth it if I can eliminate surgery.",imf
4,Lialda,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 14, 2014",28,I have diagnose with Ulcerative Colitis (Proctitis) for last 4 years. Lialda has worked for me best with no side effect. I am taking 2 tab twice daily. For people with Ulcerative colitis in distal part of colon Lialda will work best. I had tried 2 years ago to switch to Apriso only because of the cost of Lialda and had a worst flare up and took 6 month to get normal with oral steroid and steroid enemas. I am using Lialda Pharmacy Saving card which reduce my copay to $10/month.,UP2020
5,Lialda,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,10.0,,"December 29, 2011",41,"I was prescribed Asacol, Apriso, had 3 sessions of Remicade all with disappointing results. I have been using Lialda for about 21 months. I was in total remission until about 2 weeks ago..so I did really good for nearly a year. Then one hugely stressful incident caused a flare up. I am working with my doctor to get back on track.",Mama320
