0,Apriso,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,9,,"September 15, 2011",27,"I have been taking Apriso since December 2010 and have had no flareups. My doctor told me it is fine for long term use and as of right now, September 2011, he has no plans to take me off it. The only side effect I have experienced is some muscle stiffness.",Stateman1952
1,Apriso,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,6,,"August 28, 2010",21,"I was taking Lialda for active inflammatory bowel disease, with very good results but the insurance changed and dropped it.  I have been Colazol and others.  By and large have not had any luck with generic versions.  Do ok with Apriso but have discomfort in my lower intestines and very paste like movements.  Also flare up more often I think.  Might ask to try something else.",Anonymous
