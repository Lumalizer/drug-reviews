1,Infliximab,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,4,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 13, 2021",3,Remicade (infliximab):I almost lost my stomach several years ago and if it were not for Remicade I probably would have. Skin cancer is not mentioned in the black box information. I was diagnosed with a very aggressive skin cancer that was not even caught by my dermatologist that resulted in major reconstructive surgery of my arm and 33 treatments of radiation.

3,Infliximab,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 8, 2019",3,"So I was diagnosed on May 29th with colitis and when I got diagnosed first I was on steroids but I got into a bad flare up .They thought I needed surgery but they found inflixmab (: It helped so much on the first 3 doses but when I went on September 5th I got a reaction so we stopped the infusion. Last week my doctor tried it again and it still reacted badly with me. My doctor found out why my body didn’t accept infliximab anymore , it was because my immune system had gotten stronger so this medicine only helps you when your immune system is down low. Right now I’m on my way to get my Humira injection which I’m a bit scared for . Davina from England",Davina
