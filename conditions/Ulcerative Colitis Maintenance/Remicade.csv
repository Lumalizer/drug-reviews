0,Remicade,Ulcerative Colitis Maintenance,4,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 13, 2021",3,I almost lost my stomach several years ago and if it were not for Remicade I probably would have. Skin cancer is not mentioned in the black box information. I was diagnosed with a very aggressive skin cancer that was not even caught by my dermatologist that resulted in major reconstructive surgery of my arm and 33 treatments of radiation. This completely changed my life and want everyone to know that side effects can occur from this medication even when it is not originally posted as a side effect.,James
