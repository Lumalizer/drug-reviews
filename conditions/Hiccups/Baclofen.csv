1,Baclofen,Hiccups,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2021",3,Had unbearable hiccups for a week straight due to severe acid reflux. It was so bad that I was getting maybe 2 hour a sleep a night. Went to see my gastro and he prescribed balcofen 5mgs (3 x Daily). It took about 6 hours to kick in and I had to double up my dose (10mg) but the hiccups finally have subsided. Thank goodness for this medication because having recurring hiccups for a week straight was miserable.,JL
2,Baclofen,Hiccups,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 4, 2021",4,"Had hiccups 10 times an hour; often to the point of hindering breathing.  Lasted two days before I sought med help.  Nurse practitioner prescriber baclofen.  Two pills and it was gone.   10 mg.  Amazing.  I have most of the prescription left, which I will keep.",Dingus
3,Baclofen,Hiccups,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 22, 2020",4,Have had intractable hiccups for month 24/7 which generally culminate into vomiting in late evenings.  Tried gabapentin  - no effect.  Tried reglan - also no effect.  Finally baclofen 20-30 mg every 6 hours did the trick.  Initial Rx was for 10 my every 8 hours but that low a dose did nothing.  80mg per day made life tolerable and minimized the hiccups Altho I can still feel them lurking just under surface.,HateHiccups
4,Baclofen,Hiccups,8.0,,"May 30, 2020",4,"Chronic hiccups. Idiopathic. Failed gabapentin, Lycra, chlorpromazine. Responded initially to 20 mg twice a day. However to maintain effect have needed to increase to four times a day a dosing. It definitely works but doses higher than 100 mg create insomnia. Wish there was a longer acting version but it is a very inexpensive medication.",Anonymous
