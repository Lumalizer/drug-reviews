0,5-hydroxytryptophan,Depression,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 27, 2022",0,"I was taking St. Johns wort for moderate depression/SAD, and it worked well but was affecting my sleep and interacting with sleeping pills I occasionally use. My mood started to get low again a couple days after finishing them so I decided to switch to 5HTP.I'm now on my second day and I won't be taking it again. I took 50mg yesterday and it felt just like the early side effects of an SSRI. I felt nauseas, wired and spacey. Today I took 25mg and whilst it I didn't feel nauseas, I still have that strange slightly wired/spacey feeling, it reminds me of how much SSRI of's blunted my emotions and made me feel plastic.I read that 5HTP increases serotonin but may deplete dopamine and noradrenalin. St Johns Wart on the other hand stops reuptake of all of these chemicals, and would explain probably why it worked better for me.I will be going back to taking St Johns Wart, though I can appreciate these are powerful supplements and will work for some people really well.",D88
1,5-hydroxytryptophan,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 25, 2021",2,"I've been taking it for a month, I feel absolutely no difference, no worse no better. Don't feel anything what so ever. I think this might work better if you have mild depression where placebo is effective. I have taken time release 2 times daily so 200mg. Positive is I bdidn't get side effects but damn what a waste of time",Peter
2,5-hydroxytryptophan,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 28, 2021",1,"I am a 70-year-old veteran and I was diagnosed with chronic PTSD by the VA. I was severely abused as a child. I've had psychological counseling, antidepressants & anxiety meds for years. Nothing has made a difference.  Extreme anxiety and depression have been exhausting.  I've read about 5-HTP but I have never tried it until recently. (This date is July 28, 2021)  For the last month, I've been taking 1- 200 mg 'Natrol' time-release 5-HTP pill at night and it helped only a little. Then I learned I could take up to 400 mg per day, so I took 3-100 mg pills, at once, during the day to see what it would do.  Within 2 hours, I was feeling some type of emotional relief that I haven't experienced in my whole lifetime! It was emotionally overwhelming!! No antidepressant has ever done what 5-HTP has done for me!  It has honestly changed my life!",DS1
3,5-hydroxytryptophan,Depression,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 3, 2021",1,I've been withdrawing from melatonin for a month now. 5htp seems to help half the time. Can't take it after noon it will give me insomnia.I don't want to become dependant on 5 htp either perhaps I can switch to St. John's wort?  Withdrawals really suxI wish everyone great success,Kathy
4,5-hydroxytryptophan,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 8, 2021",0,"I've suffered from chronic fatigue for 3 years now. Okay during the day but as soon as I'm off work I'm exhausted and have no energy or motivation. With a 3 year old I need to be able to do more. I've tried many things and a few worked for a short time then stopped. Also, have sleep issues which may contribute. I've been taking this for 2 weeks and it's incredible. I at 50 I feel 20 years younger. Come home with lots of energy and my mood is awesome. If you asked me if I was depressed a few weeks ago I'd have sad no. But in comparison to how I feel now I'd say I must have been. I also fall asleep much faster and sleep more soundly. Although I do wake a few times but easily fall back to sleep. My wife say I no longer toss and turn or talk on my sleep. I've literally never felt better. Improved focus and clarity at work and increased energy. Based on this experience I'd say and hope my problem was low levels of Tryptophan. I only hope it's a long term fix and not a flash in the pan.",Robert
5,5-hydroxytryptophan,Depression,,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 4, 2021",1,"I took 5htp for the first time this morning. It was prescribed by my naturopath (along with b-6 complex and GABA for depression and anxiety due to perimenopause and other issues. She had told me to take 100mg in the morning and at night on an empty stomach (or without protein). Well, I accidentally took 200 mg at one time, which was obviously way too much for me. I got very nauseous pretty quickly, had diarrhea and gas pain, chills, tingling in my hands and fingers (like poor circulation), racing heart, body aches and felt wide awake but wished I could take a nap. That was 10 hours ago and I'm still feeling chills, body aches and racing heart. I am going to try tomorrow with a lower dose before I decide to give up on this supplement though.",Leo
6,5-hydroxytryptophan,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 18, 2020",2,Hi started taking 5 HTP 100 mg once a day with food at lunch time after decades of chronic depression and PTSD. I was at my wit's end been on the SSRI and other antidepressant merry go round. I thought I have nothing to lose. At night I take 2 mg of Mirtazapine plus magnesium this combination has been a godsend.  I have a ton of energy much brighter helps control cravings you get with Mirtazapine been on it for 8 weeks now doctors to easily give out prescription meds and are closed off to alternatives wouldn't go above 100 MG's may even cut down to 50 so far so good,Ruby
7,5-hydroxytryptophan,Depression,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 7, 2020",30,"After being on Prozac for years, it lost it's efficacy and then tried almost all SSRI's in the market. Nothing worked. I was paralyzed with major depression, anxiety and subsequent severe insomnia. I researched 5HTP as a last resort.  Followed recommendations of starting at 50 mg and every 3-4 days went up another 50mg till effective. I found absolute effectiveness at 400mg- Extended Release, taken every night. It has been a miracle in my life with no insomnia, depression or anxiety for the past 16 years! There are no side effects & or numbness. I can cry & feel emotions appropriately.   Life has been Great!",Mak
8,5-hydroxytryptophan,Depression,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 31, 2019",5,"I took 5-HTP three times before throwing the bottle away. Two of the times I was woken up with horrible stomach cramps, but because the drug made me tired, it was more miserable to be awake. Also feel foggy after taking it. I'm glad this works for other people but my stomach is very upset.",cotton
9,5-hydroxytryptophan,Depression,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 24, 2019",16,"Like some others I have been taking 100mg/ 1 morning and 1 before bedtime, time release for about a month. I also considered CBD oil but opted for 5-HTP. I've seen a definite positive change in mood which has translated into less depression and the only reason for not rating this 5 star is simply because I feel 30 days isn't long enough to accurately assess its effect. I'm trying to contain my excitement and hope like hell this works for me. Prescribed meds have too many uncomfortable side effects ( for me) . I can't recommend this just yet but hope to in time. All I want is to stop this painful ordeal of feeling like the elephant in the room all the time. So far so good and I can honestly say that if you've walked in my shoes I sincerely hope this works for you.",MikeG
10,5-hydroxytryptophan,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 26, 2018",13,"Taken for depression every day by mouth with a meal.  No stomach discomfort as I eat each time.  No frame of reference for not eating with capsule.Brand is ""Basic's"" ordered from local pharmacy.  100mg/d for two months.Started losing efficacy after about 30 days.  Switched off for 15.  Started regaining depressive symptoms.  Switched on and it's fine now.As for what it does, good mood is increased and anxiety somewhat managed better.  A wonder drug while it works.  Major depression for 7 years, this is the only thing that makes life a bit more bearable.Seems to lessen the emotional effects of PMS.  Sleep is shorter but more fulfilling.  No more 12 hour slumbers.I would definitely recommend that you take.  Start small, switch on and off as needed.  I take in morning for depression and anxiety.  At night would probably be better for sleep.  It tends to work in under an hour.",sudonim
11,5-hydroxytryptophan,Depression,10.0,,"January 20, 2018",14,"I suffer from insomnia, mood swings, depression, anger, outbursts of anger,  I was always mean. I have sadness and feeling of doom to where I do not function well in life.  It affected my relationships with people in a bad way. No one liked me. Doctor would not renew the antidepressants that were working.  I tried this and had instant  improvement!  I sleep better, I no longer flip out like a crazy person  over the smallest of things  and I handle stress much better.   I am less depressed and have a better quality of life.  Only side effect is I am groggy during the day",kclady48
12,5-hydroxytryptophan,Depression,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 21, 2016",25,"I tried to take 5-HTP for depression and anxiety accompanied by insomnia (early morning awakenings). I took antidepressant in the past, and it really helped, but this time I decided to try natural remedy. I went from 100 mg a day to 300mg. At first the results were great-just like when I took antidepressant. My depression lifted, sleep improved, I was not as anxious. Unfortunately, after a few weeks 5-HTP just stopped working. The positive effects were very short-lived.",Tashka
13,5-hydroxytryptophan,Depression,10.0,,"August 6, 2015",60,"This stuff is FANTASTIC! I've been having issues with mild depression for about a year now and really didn't want to see a psychologist to be put on some sort of antidepressant. I read about this stuff while doing a search about depression about 2 weeks ago so I decided to give it a go and I can honestly say that I'm a different person. I feel like my old self, happy, energetic and just plain ole normal. I highly recommend this!",l33tDad
14,5-hydroxytryptophan,Depression,8.0,,"May 12, 2015",70,Was on Wellbutrin for 10 - TEN - years. As my life had only gone downhill since taking that I make the decision that prescription antidepressants are not for me and I want to feel again...and have the energy I need to function versus being in bed all day. Two days of 5 HTP and I feel like a new person. I am remembering things so clearly when it was all fuzzy before. I am starting and finishing projects that have sat for an eternity. I hope it lasts...,Monalisact
