0,Doxepin,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 8, 2022",3,"I'm 41.  Ive suffered from anxiety, depression, insomnia, adhd and poor mood my entire life.  I started taking doxepin 10 mg per night 4 weeks ago.  My experience has been immensely positive so far.  I had repeatedly been prescribed SSRI's and SNRI's over 20 years and they were all awful for me.  My current psychiatrist prescribed me 10 mg of doxepin nightly and continued my adderall prescription.  The first night I slept soundly for the first time I can remember.  The next day I was tired but also relaxed.  I took a 4 hour nap and when I woke up I felt refreshed, in a good mood, not anxious, and motivated.  It has been that way each day.  It was unusual to feel what I imagine normal does.  I occasionally have anxious spells if I go too long without eating.  Overall its been extremely good my me.",phoeniciannick
1,Doxepin,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 2, 2021",10,"I have struggled with endogenous depression (& anxiety) since age of 19 and I am now 57. Doxepin has repeatedly given me my life back. It zaps anxiety/panic first and then depression. During my most recent bout (made worse from a concussion) I tried numerous newer meds: SSRI’s, SNRI’s , Mirtazipine, Wellbutrin thinking newer must be better. All came with special side effects (some worse than the older tricyclics) and just did not help much. Finally, I asked my dr for Doxepin and am kicking myself for not going back to it sooner. Do not be afraid of trying older tricyclics if you are not getting relief. Had good experiences with other TCA’s but Doxepin has been the best. Take the GeneSight test if you can. (SSRI’s were on my less response list - not surprised.) Doxepin side effects were initial drowsiness which decreases as you adjust and dry mouth. Used to increase my appetite but not so much this time. Start low and titrate up. I plan to stay on it for life.",SuZyQ

5,Doxepin,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 20, 2019",13,One year ago I had L2L3L4 screwed together.  I was told  there is no reason why I should not get out of bed and do 200 sit ups a day. Well after adding that to my regular work out for two and a half years one morning I got done  working out and had to go right into ER and get operated on and  off work for 6 months. I was so depressed my abs were so much to me. they put me on every thing nothing worked. I was so depressed.  After it was all said and done the Doctor said all I could do was planks and running for my core I thought I would try Silenor after going over all the meds I had I can do regular things but that's it for abs.  YES!!!!!!!!!!!! Silenor works!!!!!! I get up in the morning and fill like a million bucks!!!!!!!!! hope this works for all .......................Lefty hag.,Leftyhag
6,Doxepin,Depression,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 9, 2019",11,"I started doxepin after being addicted to sleeping pills and pain killers and almost overdosing, I had insomnia, depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. It definitely saved my life when I needed it to but I gained 15 pounds, am easily irritated/angry, and  don't feel myself anymore. I couldn't get a refill for 2 weeks and I understand why you're not supposed to stop taking it suddenly because I couldn't get out of bed and wouldn't speak to anyone for 2 whole weeks, put me in a dark hole. But I think I'll stay on it so that kinda thing doesn't happen again.",NB
7,Doxepin,Depression,,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 14, 2018",22,Have been taking Doxepin for 25 years-am now just taking 10mg at night. Doxepin saved my life . It made me feel so good and able to live a normal life again. I am very afraid to stop taking it completely even though they say when you are older you should stop. Is that true?,Grammie
8,Doxepin,Depression,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2018",8,"Well, my Dr had no skill, judgement but had experience causing injury to patients. He prescribed this out of the blue and foolishly I tried it, felt sick and wanted to stop taking it but my controlling fiance demanded I keep taking it! I know where the depression came from...I needed to get away from her, not taking old school meds. Some people might get relief from their symptoms with this since we are all different. This didn't work...quite a few side effects and the sleep didn't feel natural, at least for myself and didn't take it long enough to treat the depression. I can see how people sleep on this, you can fall asleep standing up the next day and for most of the day!",Fubar
9,Doxepin,Depression,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 26, 2018",7,"I was prescribed Doxepin for my PTSD-- I have social phobias, panic disorder, anxiety, agoraphobia and depressive disorder. First off, WEIGHT GAIN out the yazoo! I am very thin naturally, I'm 5'7"" and 115lbs. I gained 15lbs and it very much so showed! I had to pick up working out 5 days a week to stay at the 130lbs and not put on more. Since my symptoms are severe I had to be at a higher dosage. I stopped at the 160mg. when I went to the E.R. from being impacted from the constipation this medication caused (and I was taking flaxseed, probiotics, Colace regularly being on it). Also, it didn't start kicking in for my panic disorder till about 125mg. and then it turned my panic to minimal and turned generalized anxiety on full-blown (which I never had before....). Helped for depression on lower dosages but didn't help for that at all after I went past 90mg on it. However, did absolute wonders for my depression at lower dosage. Lots of baggage overall, as most of these old time drugs have.",staceya97

12,Doxepin,Depression,1.0,,"June 5, 2017",22,"I was prescribed doxepin by my Dr and was not given any informed consent regarding side effects or interactions. I am shocked that I had so many side effects almost instantly, very dangerous medication and I am sorry that I ever followed my Drs advice. I would be very careful with this med and any med that you put into your body. I wonder if the CEO of the company that invented this would let their children take it?!",Good morning70
13,Doxepin,Depression,10.0,,"May 23, 2017",60,I was diagnosed with major depression at 42. I also suffered from crippling anxiety and chronic insomnia.

16,Doxepin,Depression,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 9, 2016",80,"Has many years of  problems with depression, anxiety , derealization etc. Eventually learned these all related to Complex Multiple Trauma. But that is another story. Doxepin pretty much the ONLY antidepressant that has ever helped me. Totally a life saver over and over for me. It is HIGHLY calming as well as anti-deprssing. That is because  simultaneous to increasing serotonin and norepinephrine,  is a beta adrenergic blocker (hence anti fear etc)BUT here is the real amazing thing about Doxepin - it is VERY anti- inflammatory. Neuroinflammation (brain inflammation) is a big issue  in mental health problems. Doxepin - out if ALL dregs, addresses this best of all. Search pub med. Doxepin has saved my life many times over several decades.",Adriana77
17,Doxepin,Depression,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 15, 2016",26,I was given silenor 3 mg at start to help me stay asleep and also to help with my anxiety and very mild depression... The doxepin in this medication is an anti depressant... My first try of it I felt drunk when I woke up at 3 am and I passed right back to sleep... I noticed within a week I felt a bit more happier and my anxiety has lessened... I feel more happier as well... So the doctor is keeping me on them for a while... It has been almost a year taking silenor... There was a slight weight gain over that period of time 10 lbs over the whole 10 months. I didn't take an entire week of the pills a few months back and boy did I notice.... They say non addictive but I felt sad and depressed... Right back where I was before taking them.,Worth a shot
18,Doxepin,Depression,1.0,,"January 14, 2016",19,"My Dr was unbelievably careless and combined this with another dangerous drug. I nearly died as the result and have contemplated dying well over 100,000 times since.  Any positive review of this drug should be highly skeptical of. This is a very dangerous drug that the manufacturers should stop making it, the sooner the better!",Gonzo22
19,Doxepin,Depression,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 20, 2015",65,"Sinequan (doxepin):It works tremendously well on Insomnia and really does help on maintaining a normalcy in everyday life. Sleeping a lot at first, which in my case was a good thing. It's not the best for uplifting depression and doesn't help in taking away anxiety or panic attacks. The side affects for me was being easily bothered & hostal/angry. Will pass if you continue taking as directed,but each time you stop n then start again the experience starts over. But keep in mind,side affects vary and its different for each  of Us. What works for one might not work for another. I've been taking Sinequan/Doxepin for over two decades.",fayfaith

All three medicines work but only one has lasted, Doxepin. The other two I had no choice but to stop taking. I ended up with serious breathing problems. Zoloft several years after taking, subsided and then worse years later and Xanax after about a decade or so.

23,Doxepin,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 27, 2013",89,"I've been diagnosed with chronic insomnia and general anxiety for 9 years. I also suffer from depression, but refuse to be medicated directly for it (specifically SSRI's) after dealing with Paxil and the horrible withdrawal I experienced 8 years ago. So recently I was prescribed 30mg Doxepin in addition to my Zolpidem (Ambien) for my insomnia. My insomnia has slightly improved, but more pronounced has been the reduction in both occurrence and severity of my anxiety (within the first week) and depression (after about 3-4 weeks). It's been about 6 weeks since I started the doxepin and haven't noticed any negative side effects besides some dry mouth/eyes, which is far outweighed by the benefits I've received.",Insomniac1985
