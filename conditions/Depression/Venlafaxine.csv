I suffer GAD, depression & panic attacks more so now than ever. This medication was one of my tools to help me feel me again. I have been on it for 10 weeks and I’m now getting off of it because I feel it’s best for me. Only side effects nausea and headaches. Before I wouldn’t be able to step foot in a grocery store, public but now I can with out panicking or having anxiety. It doesn’t take it all away but it’s something that will help.",Rocky122
1,Venlafaxine,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 24, 2022",1,"This has been the most successful anti depressant I’ve tried for my anxiety. But oddly enough it doesn’t help that much with the depression. Still, I’m thankful to have it and for the anxiety relief it gives. It also didn’t take as long to work as other anti depressants, I was feeling better a few weeks after starting it, where in the past I would only notice an effect a couple of months in.

I do wholeheartedly believe that this medication saved my life at that time but I have fluctuated in dosages. Within a couple of years I was up to 150mg which worked for a long time. I eventually went up to 300mg which isn't recommended and have been trying to wean off. It will take a few months to notice an effect and the withdrawal symptoms are AWFUL. If I miss more than 1 day, I will not be able to walk. Usually it is only recommended as a 3rd or 4th option for a reason.",Anonymous

Sure, I was bipolar (type 2) and needed an antidepressant, but the psychiatrist should’ve put me on something that wouldn’t give me withdrawals when I miss even one dose.I ran out of Effexor one December while waiting for it in the mail.

I usually wake up depressed and have low energy. About an hour after I take it I have energy and feel so much better! So far so good. It’s the lowest dose so no side effects to speak of. I’ve tried every antidepressant out there and none have helped or had bad side effects. I’m almost afraid it’s too good to be true. Fingers crossed that this will keep working. I’m 61 by the way.

I had never been on an anti-depressant before, it was my first. I gained 90 pounds in 6 months. I was so exhausted that I would sleep all day and all night, waking only to eat. I had no motivation at all. I was having the most bizarre and disturbing nightmares every single night. I didn't even want to go to sleep because I was so terrified of the nightmares. I started getting rashes on my arms every time I went out in the sun, like a sun allergy. I've had depression for a long time and I've had a lot of feelings like ""I just don't want to be here anymore"" but on the Effexor I was having extreme suicidal ideation, like actually planning it out and thinking about it vividly every day and night.

No one warned me about this side effect. You should know that severe dissociation is a (rare) possibility before taking this medication. It also made me loopy. People said I was slurring my words and thought I was drunk. It affected my memory so badly that I couldn't remember to do daily tasks like preparing food, laundry and bathing.

13,Venlafaxine,Depression,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 24, 2022",1,"Beware. After a divorce it gave me a slight mood increase each morning. But in the evening I would feel agitated and low. Each day when it was time to dose I would have terrible brain zaps and feel agitated and horrible. Also ruins sex drive, causes night sweats and a zombie-like feeling. Dividing the dose did not help. Add-ons did not help. By the time I tapered I was left with a strange agitation that seems permanent. Re-instatement of alternate SSRI meds 1 year later made it worse so I did another taper and have been off for several years. Still have agitation, mood disorders also did not help. Doctors are clueless. Only through my own research can I find scholarship that recognizes a protracted WD syndrome. Ativan helps but cannot be used daily because of addiction. If you are experiencing a situational depression try to get through it natural. Doctors will admit SSRI can alter your brain in a positive way but seem less willing to say the same about long term negative changes.",jrivard

I've tried 3 SSRI's, Clomipramine, and Abilify before this drug. The drug helped improve my mood a bit, but didn't seem strong enough to help the rest of my issues.

Never needed depression meds but at 33 had lost control. Work/personal stress, new baby, lack of sleep, COVID hit, and job changes. After a year I finally realized it was also Paternal Postpartum Depression as well. Tried a couple different drugs that caused more symptoms than they solved (Buspirone was the worst). Doctor gave me Venlafaxine and took 75mg first dose June 12th, 2020. I'd say within a month there was noticeable improvement. I tried coming off Venlafaxine by going down to 37.5mg and felt anxiety/depression increasing. Stopped messing with dose and stayed on 75mg. I have had zero depression for about a year. Anxiety will show up but is definitely reduced. I feel normal and have more energy. The waiting for results is terrible when you need help NOW. But I was given Ativan to help me in the beginning which worked very well when I had panic flare ups. Haven't needed Ativan in about a year.",Jay

I never wanted to be medicated in the first place but knew I needed some kind of assistance. Switching to Venlafaxine was the worst thing that I could've done. Right away it gave me vertigo, nausea, headaches, stomachaches. And it continued off and on throughout me using it. This stuff is awful! Now 7 or 8 months later after 1 month of tapering off of this medication, I have the bad effects x100! I think I'm suffering with discontinuation symptoms. This feeling is awful.

The first month my biggest side effects were bloating and being constantly tired. Luckily after my body got used to it, they went away. The main issue with Effexor is withdrawal symptoms. If you miss even one dose, you start to feel the effects. For me it comes in the form of getting super dizzy. I'd say that's the biggest thing to take into consideration.

I gained over 70 lbs in 3 years. I was just unable to loose weight, whatever I did. I went from M to 4XL in 3 years. I was craving carbs, eating all the time, my appetite was constant. It destroyed my self-confidence, increased dramatically my anxiety when going out, and right now it is difficult to go out and live normally.

I kept telling my psychiatrist that it was making me tired and depressed and we kept going up in dosage. Got some pretty dark thoughts on this, too. Maybe it helped a bit on anxiety. Took it for about 9 months. When it was time to come off, I literally had no withdrawal so not everyone goes through those. Dr had warned me about this med and not to miss a dose, etc, due to the short half life and then warned me again coming off.

It is just the nature of the beast. During the first few weeks ensure that you are taking the time to get a work out in a few times a week and supplement any lethargy with a bit of caffeine. Weeks 5-8This is where the medication really starts to shine. If you are a male, this drug is ideal for you because it has a less likely chance of causing erectile dysfunction as it is a SRNI and not a SSRI. Your reaction to negative events, to include stressful situations, begins to dramatically change. Instead of having fast paced thoughts, you have a true sense of peace, less worry and a newfound sense of over all well-being.

I noticed on the 37.5mg dose my anxiety was still in panic mode every once in a while so at my 30 day follow up I went up to 75mg and so far just my appetite is gone and I'm calm like I usually can go from 0 to a million real quick but I'm calm.

129,Venlafaxine,Depression,3.0,,"January 25, 2020",6,Astonishingly venlafaxine is effective even at it's lowest dose initially..Initially...The step up to 150mgs was helpful a little time passes and dosage increased to 225mg and then progresses on to 375mg. At 225mg the drug was far less effective at 375mg I was persistently suicidal and suffered horrible anxiety and it had a very negative impact on my digestive system. Withdrawal just about as totally horrible as many people describe. Conclusion: At low to moderate doses up to an absolute maximum of 225mg over short periods of time a generally helpful drug. Don't even entertain an increase beyond 225mg the journey from that point for many people is not remotely something you would wish to engage with..Ever !,TinkyTonky

Since then nausea, vertigo, dizziness, unbalanced, and brain shivers have been steady, 84 hours since my last dose. This medication was good when I was on it, helped me have a functional life, but the withdrawal symptoms are very hard. I would even start to notice symptoms within 3-4 hours of missing a regular dose.

I tried an anxiolytic briefly the first week I started the Effexor but didn’t like it, so quit, but I’ve found that my negative internal narrative has improved drastically on the Effexor which has helped my anxiety significantly as well. My family and friends have noticed a huge difference in my mood and energy level. I was increased to 112.5mg daily over the winter for relapse in some depressive symptoms and just decreased to 75mg daily - having some side effects of sleep interruption with the dose titration but otherwise so far so good. My sleep was always interrupted titrating up as well, which always improved with time. My only complaint is that my sex drive decreased for a while upon starting the drug, and even though I now have it back, it’s still more difficult to orgasm.

I believe this is due to Venlafaxine being an SNRI med (as opposed to an SSRI), which more effectively treat anxiety and obsessive thinking disorders, as well as depression. Drawbacks include the usual limitation on being able to feel deep emotion, a feature in many meds, which is a relief to some people and a hindrance to others. I've also found it to encourage apathetic feelings in situations or subjects that I would usually find emotive; not a bad thing if the issue was something I would previously obsess about, but not so good if trying to feel empathetic toward the feelings of others.Overall, it has been an absolute lifesaver",Juggle123

By the third week, the dissociation was MOSTLY gone, but then I was having random panic episodes where I thought I was losing my mind and just didn't want to live anymore. The psychiatrist thought the extended release would ease that symptom, and it made it worse. I went from not wanting to live with dissociation, to not wanting to live at all. I've been tapering off over the past few days, and I was awaken at 5am this morning with HORRIBLE anxiety and suicidal thoughts, and my husband tried calming me down but I barely felt like I knew or recognized him. Both my psychologist and the head of psychiatry at Mayo Clinic agreed I need to stop taking it immediately (take 1/2 of 25mg if I experience ""brain zaps"" or any horrible side effects) but this medication is NOT for me, and they're thinking no SSRI or SSNI chemically reacts well with me after trying 3 and having worse side effects than what I was taking it for.I haven't been out to eat with my husband in 4 months.

I take 75mg of Effexor XR in the AM and 15mg of Remeron in the PM for suicidal depression and generalized anxiety. Some days I take higher doses of 112.5mg and 30mg. The combination has worked wonders for my condition. I started on Remeron initially and titrated to 45mg/day, but did not feel it was working for my depression, although it did help with sleep and appetite. I tried gabapentin for a while and was able to quit Remeron entirely for some time (wanted to give my receptors a break). Gabapentin was great for anxiety but made me more suicidal. I quit gabapentin and went back on just 15mg of Remeron, this time also adding the Effexor. I have been very happy with the results. It seems to be the first medication that really works for me. I had significant side effects when starting Effexor, but they subsided completely after about a week- feeling high much like MDMA, and I had diarrhea and some insomnia. When I increased from 37.5 to 75 mg, the only con I noticed was lower energy level (and some yawning). I started drinking some coffee to help with that. This is a very serious medication to be taking, as I know it can be very hard to withdraw from; however, I am committed to sticking with it. Eventually may increase my dose up to 150mg. Effexor makes me feel very mellow. I am less concerned about what people think of me. I am quite confident with the ladies. My sex life has been better than ever on this med combination. I have wondered if my sense of humor is dulled, however. I am also somewhat lazy, but this may change when I go up to a higher dose. Risk-taking behaviors should be watched when increasing the dose, as I broke my ankle playing sports. Overall, I give this medication 9/10 and am very happy that I got the script. I recommend taking it with Remeron to better manage the nighttime, and to counteract the side effects. They have a wonderful synergy.

I ate steamed vegetables and fruit, with occasional lean meats, cut out junk food. I took psyllium every day, added Miralax, and drank plenty of fluids.

This 4th time it was only a sudden stressful situation with my mother's health - she was diagnosed with cancer - that sank me into depression. Somehow Effexor worked again and I thank God for that. The side effects for me are almost not worth mentioning and exercise helps a lot. I feel like myself again and some joy of life is back.
