0,Mirtazapine,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 30, 2022",2,"I've been on mirtazapine for about 4 months now, and I take 22.5 mg nightly to treat my severe depression, PTSD, and severe anxiety disorder. I've been on a lot of antidepressants over the years, more particularly SSRI's and SNRI's, all of which either made things worse, stopped working, or had horrible side effects. Mirtazapine has worked incredibly well for me, and I’m doing better than I have in a long time. But to reach this point I also had the assistance of steady therapy and attendance at a partial hospitalized therapy program. Mirtazapine seems to pair very well with therapy. I  will say in addition to reducing my anxiety significantly, it has also reduced my ability to get excited or nervous for things that I think I should be. This may be a case of emotional blunting, but I do find myself able to still belly laugh and enjoy myself. I recommend mirtazapine if other meds haven’t worked, but it also seems to have cut off the extremes (good or bad) in my range of emotions.",pickmoredaisies
1,Mirtazapine,Depression,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 25, 2022",1,I went on mirtazapine after suffering from depression and anxiety. It was initially very good for sleep but it gives you an insatiable appetite. I thought I'd be fine as I'm generally quite a sensible eater but  the cravings for sugar and carbs are like nothing I've ever experienced.I am now trying to come off this medicine and it is causing all sorts of awful problems. I wish I had never started on it - it wasn't worth it.Please be careful.,Sazzle
2,Mirtazapine,Depression,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 24, 2022",1,"I took this for 2-3 years. It was great, only period in my life where I had good sleep also really helped my depression. I however quit this cold turkey. Major mistake, it was 3-4 weeks of an itchy, restless leg nightmare. Don't do it. Taper. I've since after a year off all meds been on Prozac for the past 4 months, which is good but I'm having issues with biting my tongue when I do get intermittent sleep. Therefore I am going back to mirtazapine. I'm a little nervous. As I know it will make me irritable for a while but I still thing the benefits will hopefully outweigh the negatives.",Sleepy
3,Mirtazapine,Depression,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 25, 2022",5,"Remeron (mirtazapine):Remeron helped me sleep right away and I took 15mg for 6 months.  I decided to lower it to 7.5mg because I suspected it was causing high blood pressure. I put on 20 pounds while taking this medication, but I also take lithium and losartan and they can also cause weight gain.  I was on 7.5mg for 4 months, and still slept well and had no major side effects. Then I noticed my sex drive was less and I could not reach orgasm. When I complained about that to my psychiatrist she offered a switch to trazadone. I decided not to switch, but rather to end my use on anti depressants.  I feel the lithium I take is enough to keep me from being manic and losing sleep.  I tapered to 3.75mg for 5 days and then quit. I felt tired and had a dull headache for that week.  Then, 7 days after stopping all the Remeron, I had an awful night.  I sweat, I was nauseas, and I felt unwell. The strangest symptom of withdrawal was/is the vibrating in my ear drums. It s already easing up after a couple days.",lisa

5,Mirtazapine,Depression,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 22, 2022",4,"I have always struggled with being able to sleep naturally due to suspected ADHD, which I am currently going through the process of a referral for. My symptoms became worse at the start of the Coronavirus pandemic, I was waking up multiple times a night, often as much as every hour which was incredibly frustrating. So my doctor prescribed Mirtazapine, and since taking this I have slept better than I have done in ages. I do still wake up in the night, but never for as long nor as frequent. I would say my sleep is probably normal now. I have felt better than I have done in ages, it has worked miracles for me, and I really hope I can take it for life. I had no side effects, apart from a bit of weight gain, (I craved a bit more junk food than usual), and feeling slightly ‘hungover’ after waking the next morning, but this feeling quickly passes. I think I would rather put on a little bit of weight to have much better sleep. Seriously, anyone who has doubts, give it a try.",Anonymous
6,Mirtazapine,Depression,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 10, 2022",0,"I was put on this drug when I just turned 18 because I was suicidal and very depressed, also for the appetite gain since I’m skinny.This worked like magic for my insomnia, and that’s about it. People who know me noticed a personality change, I was a lot more spaced out and zombied than usual. I did notice less anxiety but this also led to me not caring about important things and acting recklessly, I ended up having suicidal ideation a few months in so I had to stop and the withdrawals caused me to disassociate for a week straight. Not for me unfortunately",Kee

SSRI didn’t work well for me and/or gave me unacceptable side effects.  Mirtazapine help me sleep well, calm my anxiety, make me more optimistic and positive…without any sexual side effects, weight gain and now. I’m not sleeping 18 hours a day or sleepy at all during the day.  Health care professional myself, I can’t warn you enough about all the bad reviews.  People who left bad reviews seem to forget that the medication is not the only factor to consider.  They were not well before taking it so there is a lot happening outside the meds.",Anonyme
9,Mirtazapine,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 19, 2022",2,"I was put onto 7.5mg of mirtazapine for depression and anxiety after I had been on zoloft and lexapro, zoloft stopped working for me and lexapro I had a negative reaction to, I was put onto mirtazapine to help treat my anxiety and depression. Yeah I regret that. I've been on it for almost 3 months and I am incredibly tired to the point where on the weekends I can sleep up to 18+ hours. On the weekdays when I get up, I find it incredibly hard to stay awake for longer than a few minutes as I'm passed out sooner after I wake up. And when I'm up, I stay tired for another few hours making whatever I do in the morning incredibly hard. I used to be able to run on 5-7 hours of sleep and not be so tired the next day and I was able to do things, now I need at least 18 before I can even THINK about trying to do something during my day which this has overall severely impacted me.",Buzz

12,Mirtazapine,Depression,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 11, 2022",1,"Remeron (mirtazapine):I’ve been on Remeron for over a decade. It’s helped with sleep for a long time but now I have to take melatonin with it to sleep. I developed panic disorder unrelated to Remeron and now I feel it’s too weak of a medication to help prevent panic attacks 100%. Besides that Remeron is super safe, helped me gain weight and gives me bursts of excitement when looking forward to things which is an odd but cool effect. Being I’ve been on it for so long it’s safe to say this drug is safe long term. I’m afraid to ever come off of it due to horror storied of coming off medication for long term.",Antoinette

I had lost weight & it has helped me gain it back, I couldn’t sleep, was irritable, nervous & depressed all the time & this has made me more happy & feeling better. I was taking Xanax 1mg. 3 times a day, ambien at night, which wasn’t working, now I’m off those meds, so glad of this worked for me. If this helps anyone, 3 weeks ago I had my Thyroid medicines renewed, they gave me EUTHYROX brand, sold by WALMART & I’ve been having vertigo & other problems, I called the pharmacy & they are giving me my regular brand, I googled this & it has a lot of side effects, so beware of meds.",Donna

I gained 15 pounds in just over a month, and my normal weight is 110 pounds, so that's a very high percentage increase.  All I wanted to do was eat.  I woke up hungry and even after I ate, I was hungry.  This stuff should be BANNED. Do NOT TAKE IT, unless you're severely underweight and need to gain.

17,Mirtazapine,Depression,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 21, 2021",0,"I was switched from SSRI to mirtazapine after my anxiety and depression got worse. In general I felt so much better, more energetic and could function. But it gave me severe mood swings to the point I couldn’t control my anger and rage, also increased my appetite to the extreme, and knocked me out for 12 hours every night (not any good for me trying to get back to work!) so eventually came off it after a month when these symptoms didn’t subside",Ell
18,Mirtazapine,Depression,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 14, 2021",1,"Started out at 15 mg. Barely any side effects, it worked very well for the first 6/8 months. I was sleeping well, I was energetic, and even though going through a very tough time felt optimistic about the future. Eventually, it started to poop out on me, not suddenly, slowly I started to have more and more bad days. So my doc upped it to 30 mg, which I've been on for 3 months now and I'm probably the most miserable I've been in a long time. No energy, I often feel out of it like my brain isn't working properly and as a result of it had an accident at work which I can only hope isn't going to affect me forever, I cry a lot, feel completely hopeless. And this is every day.Idk if it's related to mirtazapine or whether it simply stopped working on me entirely, either way, I've booked an appointment to come off it and try something else because this is unsustainable. Also the weight gain. I had none for several months, but now I've gained 6 kg which is far too much.",ell
19,Mirtazapine,Depression,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 2, 2021",3,"After trying this for about two weeks, I thought I had found my miracle drug. It lifted up my mood so much and enabled me to take part in everyday activities again. I cannot describe to you the gratefulness I felt because of this. It also didn't negatively effect my sexual functioning, which was one of the main reasons I went on it in the first place. However! Now looking back I realise it made me extremely irritable, mainly because I was tired all the time. It also gave me quite intense mood swings. I eventually had to go off it because it triggered an eating disorder I had previously recovered from - it changed my appetite and weight so much that I couldn't handle it. Still, I feel that mirtazapine would be great for someone who has trouble sleeping and no issues with disordered eating habits.",Caro

I am a 40 year old Caucasian male, 6 ft 1 /180 lbs, and I was prescribed this and instructed to take one before bedtime. I took it with my usual single Benadryl and melotonin. About an hour later, as I became drowsy, my joints started to buzz so I went to bed. The buzzing turned to vicious burning and spread up my bones and then to my muscles becoming so unbearable I was soon writhing and screaming. This was punctuated with waves of convulsions that had my body contorting unnaturally. I called a nurse on call who said those were not listed as side effects and suggested remedies that proved useless (ibuprofen, shower/bath, hydration). Between convulsions I paced the house, the coolness of outside gave little relief and my body was engulfed in such fire. It slowly improved over 24 hours and I was given a benzo to sleep.",David Junto

The only pro about this drug in my opinion is that it helps you sleep. To be honest though it made me sleep too much, and it was SO HARD to get up in the morning. I was always late to work, and slept the whole day on weekends and so I fell back into a depression. If you have problems with energy throughout the day this is not the drug for you.

25,Mirtazapine,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 4, 2021",2,"I've been taking 45mg Mirtazapine at night for 18 months and have largely found it to be fantastic for depression and sleep problems.  However, I have discovered is not all brands work in the same way. My usual experience is that I am asleep within 2 hours of taking the medication and that I get 7 or 8 hours of good quality sleep. I have been dispensed the Milpharm generic twice and have found it does not induce sleep and leaves me groggy all day. Through a bit of research, I have learned that 45mg of Mirtazapine is meant to be activating rather than sedating and should be taken in the morning. While I can't say that I have felt 'activated', I have definitely felt disrupted when taking the drug following my nightly routine. My intention is to check what the pharmacy is dispensing before my prescription is sent over so that I can avoid this issue. Essentially, I suggest paying attention to the brand if it suddenly feels like the medication has stopped working.",Dee G

Taken about 1-2 hours before bed was perfect, I'd drift off easily, though getting up the following day could occasionally be a struggle if I took it late as it induced long, heavy sleep. Had awful cramps the week after starting, but since then, virtually no menstrual pains whilst I was on the medication (rare side-effect?). Definitely felt a lift in mood after two weeks, and for the most part, could manage severe depression and anxiety a bit better. However, I did experience strong cravings for food, especially sugary things, that were nearly impossible to resist, and definitely gained weight because of it. The dysmorphia stressed me out more and more, so I opted to try another medication.Because I was on a low dose, I was told to stop taking it and wait 5 days for it to flush out of my system and begin something new.

It was almost like I totally never wanted to do crafting again. That’s when I fell asleep on the sofa. I will not take these ever again. Even more after reading all these reviews.

But recently, I've noted that I'm more relaxed, and I don't have the existential dread all day. The only slight downside is that I put on half a stone, but as I was fairly skinny, that isn't too much of an issue. Also, it has given me restless leg syndrome, which can make it hard to fall asleep at night, but that is a minor complaint compared to how I was feeling before.",AmeliaVV

On the mirtazapine I am significantly happier, panic attacks decreased to 1 every month if not every other month, or every few months, and even when I'm on my cycle. Panic disorder and depression was incredibly debilitating, so I didn't sleep at all since. When I was put on this, I am able to sleep through peacefully every night fully through to each morning. I highly recommend taking this with a snack or food if you have a sensitive stomach as this may cause nausea. First few weeks, had a hard time waking up every morning, irritable for the first few months. I eat more on this medication, but its fine with me.

It has robbed me of my young adult years and made me diabetic. At first it helped with sleep and generalized anxiety, but as it became less effective and the dose increased I became more and more apathetic, unmotivated, lazy, loss of personality, loss of feeling of empathy and affection towards others. It made me okay with sitting around being alone and doing nothing. Now it’s completely pooped out and all I’m left with are the side effects. Tapering down is also a struggle with severe withdrawals. I highly advise people to stick to medications with more of an evidence base- SSRIs, SNRIs, benzodiazepines, TCAs, and MAOIs... none of these atypical antipsychotic garbage. Mirtazapine basically is an atypical antipsychotic but without the dopaminergic receptor antagonism. Stay away from this garbage.",Anonymous

Eventually he weaned off it over 3 months but them a few months later became extremely anxious and suicidal and insomniac. He is now back on it with sertraline 50mg but he has cut back to just 3.75 and it seems to be enough to be enough to take the edge off the sertraline and help him sleep. Wish he never started on it. He has Parkinson’s now and I can’t help wondering if these drugs and the antibiotics they had him on for roseacea helped to bring on his condition. He is in his 50s.

However, I don't feel as though the issues with anxiety and depression have been helped any from taking the pills.I still feel extremely anxious at times, so much so that I feel afraid to attempt things. And as far as the depression and mood control are concerned. I still feel angry a lot of the times, mostly internalized and kept to myself. Or I can be sat watching TV and find myself welling-up and crying at everything. So needless to say I am not feeling the benefits that others have. I do have the weight gained issues others have mentioned and have gained almost 4 stone over the time I have been on them.",Sheydee

Had restless legs that were driving me mad then this ferocious appetite. Ate a load of satsumas as all the snacky food I could find. Slept well. No vivid dreams as such to report.

278,Mirtazapine,Depression,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 7, 2018",14,Started Mirtazapine at 15mg. Helped sleeping for about a week as I was only sleeping 1 hour a night for over a month but then had little effect. Could go to sleep but would wake up after about 3 hours and couldn't get back to sleep. No increase in appetite at all. Increased to 30mg but still had bad anxiety and some depression after a few weeks. Then depression started creeping up so increased to 45mg for 1 week but depression increased to the point I felt like I had no purpose in life. No motivation to even get out of bed. Even brushing my teeth was a huge task.  Going to stop cold turkey as I haven't felt this bad ever. Going back to pDoc to try something else.

It probably made me less depressed because I didn't have as much insomnia, but it also certainly made me emotionally numb and extremely groggy for the past few months. I regret taking it for more than a couple weeks. This should be a SHORT term drug for insomnia, not a long term drug for depression.

My college grades are back up to standard, and I've found myself generally enjoying life.

If you're relatively healthy, not on many other drugs, don't do any drugs or drink a lot it's a very helpful and basically side effect free.

On the plus side after around 30mins I feel refreshed and better than I have for a long long time and I would rate the treatment a success.

However, the major side effect that makes me stop it is the weight gain aspect.  It makes me eat all the time and have cravings to sugar all day long.  I have been on and off Remeron for the last 5 years and the only reason that I am off it is the weight gain.  I have tried many many medications but nothing worked for me.

I'm not sure if it's from Remeron or Acupuncture therapy and homeopathic drugs that I'm on or a combination of both. The only side effect that bothers me is that I can't easily get out of the bed in the morning. I'm waking up but I do not want to get out of bed...Very strange thing?,vasxyp

I have experienced a red swelling burning sensation in my face and neck - almost like a sunburn, painful, lasting at least two days then still feeling a little sensitive in my face and neck. My sleep is better, however there are still nights when it takes me a couple of hours to fall asleep, other times I go out like a light.  My appetite is better and I am not as anxious  anymore.  I have tried many other anti-depressants and Remeron(30mg) is the best for me by far.  I only hope that the face problem goes away.  I did read a comment here by someone who was experiencing facial edema.  In the monograph it does allude to this.",rafflesmom
583,Mirtazapine,Depression,10.0,,"October 3, 2009",42,"I had insomnia because of my chronic fatigue syndrome and depression combined. So I had not slept properly for about a year couldn't get to sleep until 4am even when going to bed at 9 pm then when finally dosing I had vivid horrible dreams slept lightly and woke up between 3-10 times a night. This went on for a year so I was completely sleep deprived. When I was hospitalized for my depression they changed my melatonin to mirtazipine now I sleep like a baby and its great! Only side effects I had was increased appetite so I put on half a stone, but managed to lose it within two months as I had energy for the first time in a year to use the gym! Id recommend it to anyone it really works!!! iI've been on 30mg for about 5 months now.",bebsxo

Crave lots of carbs, and have been eating like I have never before. I have gained 11 lbs in just 1 month on Remeron. It also has a nice sedation effect to help with sleep. When I take my 30mg dose at night, I have everything ready because after 45 minutes I can barely keep my eyes open, and then get a great night sleep. Side effects are worse during the first week, and then everything balanced out! If you suffer from sleep and or eating, then Remeron could be the biggest blessing in your life also.

I had previously taken 60mg Fluoxetine for 2 months from which I was suffering horrible side effects, strange as I'd had a successful 6 month run on it several years ago. Having weaned myself off that and onto Mirtazapine I can't begin to describe the difference I'm feeling. Before I felt worthless and suicidal, had no appetite, couldn't sleep, and when I did I suffered from night terrors, and also had a complete lack of energy. Now I'm on Mirtazapine I can sleep again, I'm eating which in turn is giving me more energy, and I actually feel like myself! Plus my sex drive was non-existent and it's now returned to normal. So far, this is my wonder drug. Big thumbs up!",kimbalilly

When I do wake up I feel refreshed and ready for the day (I found that if I take too much I will feel sluggish and tired for at least a day).  I no longer need Valium or Stilnox.  I am borderline bi-polar and have HSP (hyper sensitive personality).  This medicine has made me feel like a normal person again with the ability to express all my feelings in a normal way.  I no longer keep things inside, or explode with rage.  I am more tolerant and basically a more sane person to be around.  I have found I have an increase in appetite and headaches, but I will gladly pay this price for the benefits.",Za01

Doctor gave it to me because I wasn't eating/had no desire to eat for a week and I wasn't sleeping at all, and also for depression.This drug gives me crazy hunger cravings I have been on it for about  2 1/2 weeks now. When I first started it I was eating everything. Butter toast is still my favorite. I notice I crave salty and sweet foods. I am sleeping all of the time and I am on 15MG at bedtime. I have to drink coffee so I can get up and function if I have nothing particularly important I sleep until 3 or 4 o'clock.

It also helped me sleep, which was a God send after being on Effexor, but it also made me sluggish (mentally and physically) throughout the entire day. As an added side effect, I found myself unable to control myself overeating. I'm a student currently on summer break, and I work out five to six times a week, both strength training and (mostly) cardio. I cut out most starchy stuff in my diet (I get my carbs almost exclusively from fruits and veggies). Despite this, I put on around ten pounds of fat that would not come off no matter what.

Aside from the side effect facial odema (after 2 weeks so mild you wouldn't know it's there) this drug has been perfect for me. It has improved my mood a lot.To begin with I was able to sleep perfectly. Taken with quetiapine (400mg) I was getting over 8 hours a night for the first month or two. However now that effect has gone and I'm needing benzodiazepines to get any sleep at all.The weight gain has been a blessing too. Before mirtazapine I lost 14kg in a month. I'm now nearly back to my previous weight, though again the quetiapine may have something to do with it.

I've been on it for a good 8 years or so and it still helps me sleep. The hunger side effect subsided for the most part...a good thing because I gained too much weight back at first, then leveled out at 130lbs.
