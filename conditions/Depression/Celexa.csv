1,Celexa,Depression,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 4, 2022",5,"Well I have put depression, but after this worked incredibly well I realise there was a strong element of OCD as well.Have had many others, none of which helped at all, Paxil/Seroxat and Sertraline/Zoloft were just awful, really awful.Did 20 mg for 6 weeks, no effect at all.I then did a deal with my shrink, I go up to 40 mg for 8 weeks, and if it didn't work I get ECT, which was my choice.After about 7 weeks it worked, depression gone, anxiety gone and what I now know was OCD gone.Special bonuses, rejection sensitivity gone totally, worrying gone totally, having to check I Iocked my front door 20 times totally gone, assertiveness up massively.I have since read this happens to a few, I am one of them.I so wish I had it 30 years ago.",itude

3,Celexa,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 13, 2021",4,"I felt compelled to write a review on my experience. I'm into the second week of this drug and it's been a miracle. I started at 10mg for a week and increased to 20mg in the second week. The first two days were rough, felt like the flu and increased depression and anxiety. After a week I woke up with energy and no negative thoughts. Prior to this I woke up not wanting to live and dragging myself out of bed. I was plagued with negative thoughts, I was in a deep fog and struggled cognitively. Now in my week two on Celexa I feel great, I'm also taking 5mg of Trazadone for sleep which also causes me to feel nauseas for the first few weeks. Everything is balanced out and I'm back to being me again! I wish anyone reading this lots of love and hope.",kGminty

5,Celexa,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 25, 2021",9,"Was on the medication for around 4 months, totally alleviated my depression (20mg) was a lot more easy going and content with life. Took things in my stride.I will say however that although it does alleviate symptoms of depression it also makes you very unmotivated in terms of your goals and life achievements. It made me content with just getting myself to work and then relaxing and sleeping the rest of the time.I would say this would do wonders for somebody a bit older and more contented in life. I'm going to try to find something less sedating.Good luck everybody, sending love",Tommytucker

I started feeling a little flat so I saw my PCP and we agreed to switch since I felt like it was time to try something different, so I slowly weaned off the Zoloft and started taking 10mg of Celexa and that was not working so we bumped up to 20mg of Celexa.

I went to the doctor because I was in a constant state of trying not to cry. I have taken Celexa for a month, and I feel normal.  I realize now that I have been suffering from at least mild depression and anxiety for years. I don’t remember feeling normal like this ever. I believe I would have been a much better husband and father all of these years if I would have dealt with this earlier.  It’s like the first time when I wore prescription lenses.  I didn’t realize how bad my vision was until I could see clearly.  I feel the same about what Celexa has done for my mood.  My range of emotions are narrow and smoother rather than the wide range and spiking (or plummeting) emotions.  PS, child’s cancer (following radiation and chemotherapy), is undetectable.

11,Celexa,Depression,2.0,,"March 11, 2021",5,"I was prescribed Celexa for depression. It worked great and I felt much better, but I gained weight I was FAMISHED all of the time and eating made no difference. I gained 40 pounds in three months. Went from a size 6 to a size 14 so fast that I skipped sizes 10 and 12 entirely. I was over 50 with a history of overweight females and diabetes in my family. Doctor was unresponsive to my concerns and said that we were going to keep taking the Celexa. I didn’t argue with her, even though I knew that we weren’t going to keep taking it. I stopped the Celexa. I had no withdrawal symptoms after stopping cold turkey, but it was work taking off any of the weight I had gained, never have been back to a size 6. The depression eventually came back, after living with it and suicidal urges for a year wasstarted on Wellbutrin. Other meds were added as other symptoms became evident ( mostly anxiety).

12,Celexa,Depression,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 24, 2021",6,I only had two 20 mg doses of Celexa and it made me feel very strange. It was like feeling out of reality and I experienced  blurry vision and headache. I never want to use this medication  again.,Mrs Bunny
13,Celexa,Depression,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 2, 2021",12,"I first started celexa when I was 17 and continued to use it until I was nearly 20. I was able to get to 40 mg and had no issues with sex drive. I was able to cope with a sexual trauma, attend community college, even helped me get my first job. And I was still able to enjoy alcohol as well. Only reason my GP changed my meds to 20 mg lexapro is he claimed it was more effective. Well why fix something that isn’t broken. I was on lexapro 20 mg until recently it pooped out due to the increase in anxiety from covid, work and suicidal thoughts returning. I am now on day 4 of celexa and still have anxiety and loss of appetite. Then again the first week can be the most difficult when starting an antidepressant. I’m on 10 mg and gradually decreasing the Trintellix. Hopefully I see improvement by Tuesday when I increase to 20 mg celexa. It may be more effective this time since I have a toolbox of coping skills I didn’t have 7 years ago (yoga, hiking, meditation, therapy).",Dmccuddles27

15,Celexa,Depression,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 18, 2020",154,"I want to write this review to anyone struggling with OCD. I have been struggling with OCD for years, and was put on Celexa. Let me tell you, it helps immensely. It did not work right away, and there are some initial side effects (nausea yuck!). I take it in the  morning 40 mg. My OCD doctor is wonderful (highly recommend seeing a specialist in OCD). And she stated that for OCD this drug is safe to even go up even higher dose if necessary. I want to write this to give people HOPE. I was in a very very dark place with my OCD, I felt I would never escape the pain and discomfort of OCD. It did not work right away (which is normal), but once I got up to 30mg after a month or so I started to see improvement. This medication SAVED ME!! Truly Thank you to whoever created this medication, it is life saving for those of us who struggle with OCD and depression. Please anyone out there who has OCD starting this, be patient with yourself, find a good doctor, and know that there IS HOPE!!!",nellie
16,Celexa,Depression,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 7, 2020",90,"I started on 10 mg of Celexa in 2016, after 7 years of depression and suicidal ideation. Once the drug began to take effect I had 3-4 months of feeling neurotypical. My only side effect during this time was trails of movement and rainbow auras around lights. This, however, was a very small price to pay for finally feeling good.Month 5 I entered an unshakable state of numbness. I began sleeping through full days again. I was unable to feel empathy for others.After a year or so of all-consuming numbness, I began slipping. By the end of the 2nd year, I had spiraled into the darkest place I have ever been in my life. Suicide was the only thing on my mind. I had such violent intrusive thoughts that I could hardly sleep, I could hardly lay still even. I no longer take Celexa and my head is much more clear. P.S. it does get better.

21,Celexa,Depression,2.0,,"December 11, 2019",31,"I was prescribed Celexa for severe anxiety and depression back in 2015, and took it until January of 2019. Prior to taking Celexa, I was VERY functional--but an emotional wreck. I would cry for hours, lash out at my loved ones, & was so miserable that my parents finally intervened. My first few months on Celexa were great, I cared about nothing and was freed from my anxiety--but I stopped doing my homework almost entirely. I would sleep for hours during the day despite getting a full night's sleep, lost all motivation, and felt numb. Celexa made me constantly thirsty, sweat excessively, and have low blood pressure.I remained on it because I didn't know any better, even when my anxiety came back. I have now been off of it for 10+ months, due to the blood pressure issue, and am still experiencing the side effects. I fear the brain fog, lack of motivation, and sleep paralysis will never leave me, I worry that I will never be ""myself"" again.",Lilly

I felt better for a short period of time and then it quit working. Now I have more anxiety than I first started with. I’m trying to wean off sleep meds but found that Celexa causes insomnia so how does that help? I’m beginning to have severe stomach issues that I think are related to the increased anxiety.

26,Celexa,Depression,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 5, 2019",43,"I was on Celexa in  2015 and found initially it worked well. After a while the benefits stopped and it had a number of side effects. Swelling of my face , very red eyes and few others. I had blood tests thinking it was something else but everything came back normal. Recently I started taking a magnesium supplement and I'm 90 percent certain magnesium deficiency  was the cause of my long term depression. I'm feeling similar to initial benefits of celexa. I'm not a doctor but from what I understand depression and stress  deplete magnesium levels in body therefore the calming effects of celexa may have contributed to an increase in magnesium being stored in body which in turn improved my mood. Magnesium certainly works me and I wont be going back to Celexa.",Kenny8

(I am 37 yrs. old) I was on prozac very happily for 15 years (other than during pregnancy) and considered it a good drug but it stopped working.  Celexa was a miracle drug.  I was able to cope with every aspect of my life and felt no real major depression while on it BUT....It took me a while to realize the side effects were AWFUL.   I would randomly see smoke, my vision became so bad I needed glasses and my memory was awful (which is maybe why life was running so smoothly! I had no idea what was going on??)...Anyways, I was super sad to go off it because I felt so good and even made many friends as my social anxiety didn't exist. But since going off my vision is fine, not more seeing smoke and my memory - well, I am not sure it every came back completely or maybe it is just my life...I run a company and have 4 young children.

33,Celexa,Depression,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 5, 2018",55,"I have been on celexa now for many years. I had almost immediate results. It was after the second dose I felt better.

I have tried almost every antidepressant drug on the market. Some helped a little, but I still struggled with depression.  Since I have been on celexa, I have not been suicidal.  I have had some sadness because that is life and I have chronic pain too, but I have had no thoughts of suicide since I started celexa.

As far as psychological, I found that it caused me to be a bit colder and more rational minded, rather than feelings oriented. That had its positives and it’s negatives. I also found while I was on it, I was less creative- though I’m not really sure if that was the Celexa or the aftermath of the depression.I will say: DO NOT go off this cold turkey.

They would move in waves and I also started seeing shadowy figures. It was very overwhelming and scary.

I'd suffered with anxiety most of my life, but found alternative methods of coping. I typically make 15k or better steps a night during my ER shifts, so to suddenly be unable to move, I was floored! My neurologist recommended I try an SSRI  (Celexa) temporarily to help with my being depressed, and I reluctantly agreed. I was adamant about not taking SSRI's as I don't like anything fooling around in my brain. But it worked. I had minimal side effects, and even they eventually subsided within the first month of use.

Someone here said that healthy eating and exercise will solve all depression and anxiety problems. That is not true. I practice healthy eating, go to therapy and exercise daily yet it has not solved depression issues. Some here have experienced terrible issues with this medication. 10mg to start off with is not for everyone. I am disappointed that the medication doesn’t offer 1mg for us who are highly sensitive.

And I am a pro.It's just too dangerous of a mind drug, and perhaps only suitable in extreme situations like death of a family member.Certainly not for just being in a rut, sadness or the blues. It will just zombie you out. Glad I experienced it. Time to move on with life. Without a brain fog chemical. Orgasms are a sign of life",Mike Pulse
