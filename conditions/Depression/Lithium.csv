0,Lithium,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 24, 2022",1,"I've been diagnosed with MDD, PTSD, GAD, and ADD. I've also had many inpatient hospitalizations over the past three years this past one being my 22nd. I've tried many medications like lamictal, lexapro, abilify, etc. None of which worked. My most recent medication was Risperdal .25 mg twice a day. Which did not work either. The psychiatrist at the inpatient facility put me on Lithium 300mg twice a day and it almost instantly worked but not completely. He then raised it to 300 mg three times a day which has been working perfectly. It's not a cure for me since I still have my work to do so my depression is still there. But I can honestly say that my suicidal thoughts have been decreased with this medication. The only side effect I've had is feeling fatigue for the first few days but eventually it went away and I feel a lot better than before.",LAJ

Was is in four different mental hospitals, taking every antidepressant you can imagine. A few weeks ago I went to the doctor and he prescribed me lithium. Within a week and a half my anxiety and panic attacks were gone and my depression has lifted to a large degree. I’m at 300 mg right now and they want to get me up to 600 mg, I can’t wait to see what it does for my depression. I absolutely love this drug and I’m having no side effects.

I cannot believe it. I still have a ways to go but I feel better than I have in the past year. I’ve been depressed for about a year now, tried medications, lots of psychotherapy, PHP, and got put in inpatient. I continued to feel depressed and have suicidal thoughts. It seemed as nothing was working. After four days of Lithium, I’m starting to feel better. I cannot wait to see how much more it helps in the next few months! I’m nervous about the side effects but I’m hopeful that I will continue to get better. Lithium is a miracle drug for me.

9,Lithium,Depression,1.0,,"July 10, 2021",4,"Misdiagnosed as bipolar by campus MD simply Because depression and anxiety didn’t respond to SSRIs. Depression got *MUCH* worse for 3 months. After new doctor reduced and came off Lithium, things got astonishingly better within about 2 weeks. Long story short - ask/watch for these things:1. Is this really bipolar - or just depression/anxiety ?2. Are they running a CORRECT Lithium level?? (Timing is critical here???)3. Check your thyroid? Hypothyroidism can add to depression. 3. Experiencing cognitive dulling? - high-flying brainiac college student who now can’t even think straight can add to depression?Couple of things changed to when or after Lithium was added - like starting a low dose of Lamotragine, and Clonapin for anxiety - and finishing a COVID-locked-down isolating freshman college year - but all was still TERRIBLE and getting worse. Then the Lithium was stopped - and that is what finally made things suddenly become abruptly better!",Xxxxxx

My doc has only upped my dose today to 800mg, so let's see if that works. A lot of my depression stems from how I was brought up and I don't think medication can take that away. I've even been seeing a private psychotherapist for over 4 years, as helpful as it can be I'm still very depressed. I think it's this world we live in - it is depressing. I have hobbies and play music, I have a boyfriend and a couple of friends but I still can't help feeling the way I do. There's days I where I don't wash and I'm in bed for about a week at a time until I feel good again. No matter what I do or say to myself I just can't fine the motivation to do anything!

I was forced to take it during my first hospitalization and immediately I started getting awful tremors in my hands. It got so bad that often I couldn’t write. This happened to pretty much everyone who took it so they were referred to as lithium shakes. If you had shaky hands, the first thing a person would ask was how’s the lithium treating you? I also started getting these jolts that felt like I was being momentarily electrocuted. I would usually drop whatever I was holding and once it was so bad that I fell.

This condition develops as a result of chronic treatment with antidepressants .I have been on one SSRI or another for 25 years. The symptoms of tardive dysphoria are Anxiety, irritability, depression, apathy, uneasiness, restlessness and dissatisfaction with self and life. The word tardive indicates that the dysphoria is late onset. My life has been a living nightmare since this started over 2 years ago.

It’s been especially devastating since I was forced to leave a wonderful career due to this illness.  My psychiatrist finally referred me to a world-renowned doctor. This doctor responded to me within two days.  He said that Lithium along with Spravado and intensive TMS is the appropriate treatment. (The TMS is done for 9 minutes, 10(!) times a day for 5 days.  This protocol is approved and has conducted studies on it.)  He also  said that side effects such as weight gain and tremors are minimal and occur if the dosage is above the therapeutic level.

30,Lithium,Depression,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 5, 2019",24,"Lithium takes the edge off my moods without intolerable side effects. It will not make me ""happy,"" any more than the other prescriptions I have tried, but I doubt that's what any of them are really intended   for.  I have fewer suicidal thoughts, or at least the emotions accompanying them are less acute, more measured and rational.  (Yes, it's perfectly possible to be both rational and have suicidal thoughts.)The main side effects have been fatigue and odd dreams. If I increase the dose I expect, based on past Rx experiences, to feel  less stressed but  more drugged.  That is a tradeoff I will have to consider.  I can't predict what I will decide. Given the extremely low cost of lithium and its widely acknowledged benefits in even small doses, I may just stick to the latter and accept the modest results that accrue.",Hambone

51,Lithium,Depression,9.0,,"October 21, 2013",158,"Lithium is my Wonder Drug. I'm 51, was depressed on & off for years, had major depression for 7+ years, & have been suicidal since age 7. The last 2 years were exhausting trying to stay ahead of the suicidal pull in spite of entering therapy & getting medicated. I finally asked my psychiatrist for ANY aggressive treatment -- regardless of the severity of the side effects -- because I was going to lose the battle.He asked me to try Lithium, first.Within a month, I had ZERO desire to kill myself.Side effects: Major leg tremors (I take Effexor). I feel a little flat, but NO complaints; I can't REMEMBER the last time I wasn't suicidal, DAILY. I'm STUNNED at how this ""alternative"" feels & am glad I held on long enough to experience it.",Proponent of Lithium For Suicidal Ideation
52,Lithium,Depression,1.0,,"October 8, 2013",51,"Have suffered with clinical depression for fifteen years and have been on numerous antidepressants. Have now been taking lithium for 9 months and have had a lot of problems including hands shaking, legs feeling as though they are going to give way a lot of the time, whole body feeling heavy, nausea, parts of my body suddenly jerking, sweating, but worst of all I feel as though I have had a personality transplant and do not recognize the agitated person I have become, the nightmares, my partner is very concerned.  I am reducing the dose to come off it. I have just noticed on this site that it has a high interaction risk if taken with venlafaxine which I have been prescribed with it at the same time.",sues1066
53,Lithium,Depression,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 20, 2013",65,Started Lithium in 1986.  This has been my bedrock since then.  In 2011 my doctor added Wellbutrin because I was sub-clinically depressed and felt stuck.,lsrigg
54,Lithium,Depression,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 6, 2013",154,"I was on many anti-depressants and none of them helped with my suicidal thoughts except lithium. Some medications I was on made me better, but very flat and emotionless. For me, lithium only takes the sharp edges off the bad emotions and leaves room for good (but not manic) ones. I had slight hand tremors for about a year after starting this, which was annoying but not incapacitating. They are gone now. I also gained about 10 pounds during the first few months, but lost it easily and I am now lighter than when I started. People used to tell me: Oh you'll gain so much weight, but it is mostly water weight because you get very thirsty. Overall, my quality of life is much, much better. Also you can safely stay on lithium for years.",123Katherine123
