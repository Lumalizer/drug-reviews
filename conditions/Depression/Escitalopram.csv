0,Escitalopram,Depression,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 15, 2022",1,"Lexapro (escitalopram):Okay, It kinda worked 50/50. At first lifted my depression (but I got hypomania). Major anxiety at first. It helped with dissociation tho. I couldn't sleep at night and I was sleepy during the day. I also had an episode of like half(?) depression. I am not saying I don't recommend it, actually I do, because it has changed *something*. I JUST WASN'T DEPRESSED, IT WAS BIPOLAR, so that's a pity. I didn't have any serious physical side effects.

1,Escitalopram,Depression,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 2, 2022",2,"Lexapro (escitalopram):I started taking Escitalopram about 3 years ago to address anxiety and depression. For the first week, I started at 5 mg and then 10 mg and experienced a panic attack and some increased anxiety, excessive yawning and nausea. These side effects disappeared within a few weeks. I am now taking 20 mg and find that this is the most effective dose for me. The medication helps me to feel more motivated, my brain feels calmer and I am more easily able to counter negative thoughts rather than dwelling on them, I have more energy and my mood feels more stable with less ups and downs especially around my menstrual cycle. I also feel less anxious in social situations and previous situations where I would feel anxiety, such as before making a presentation at work. Overall, this medication works really well for me and I’m satisfied.",CatLover42391

7,Escitalopram,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 5, 2022",0,"An Update. I have been on Escitalopram 10mg since this past July. A few weeks ago, I started to feel flat or moody, not social, no motivation. Depression increased. I figured it was the winter months since nothing had changed in my life. 10 days ago, I decided to increase to 15mg and changed it to taking it at noon instead of bedtime. (I take other meds at bedtime and figured maybe those meds decrease the effectiveness). I was also concerned that maybe my body got use to the med and it just wouldn't work as well and I would have to switch SSRIs. BUT I have to say that it really did help! I am more cheerful and happy and social again. I am just moody ever so often, but I guess that's just me XD I relied a lot on cannabis to pick up my mood, but haven't touched the stuff since the increase. Just didn't feel like I needed it. As far as side effects go, my ankle cramps came back and needing a nap in the evenings. But I see this as temporary. I will try to go back to 10mg in summer. See how it goes.",CedarRose

My daughter started on 10mg and did pretty well.  She experienced a panic attack while taking it, and talked to her dr about it.  The dr raised her to 20 mg and she has been on it for 3 days.   She can hardly get herself to do anything.  She is so tired and seems so depressed.  I don’t know if she just needs more time to adjust to 20mg, or if it’s too much? What have you found?",Maisy

This past year has been the most stable and happy I have ever been. I no longer spiral and cry everyday, and I feel so much more inspired and productive. I use to feel very intense waves of sadness and depression, and no amount of CBT and positive thinking could help lol. I take 10 mg every night before bed. Since starting it I have had no side effects. I wish I would have been prescribed it a lot earlier in my life. I also have general anxiety, social anxiety and a bit of ocd and I think it has helped with all of those as well. This medication has made such a positive difference in my life, I never want to go off of it.",Jessie

Yes I did have some side effects: increased anxiety, agitation and strange mood swings but be patient, these do eventually go away. It took about 8 weeks for it to work and during that time I did think about quitting, so I strongly urge anyone in their first 8 weeks experiencing side effects to hold it out because it's worth it in the end. I was originally on 10mg but I've increased to 15mg as I was feeling less depressed but unenthusiastic on 10. The extra 5mg has given me more energy and positive emotion.",Toby
11,Escitalopram,Depression,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 18, 2022",1,"Lexapro (escitalopram):I got on Lexapro shortly after the birth of my daughter. I recently quit taking it after 3.5 years. Lexapro helped me to come out of my depressed state, somewhat. I no longer felt sad, but at the same time, I did NOT feel joyful. I increased my dosage to 20 Mg and still didn't feel a difference. I also felt like it numbed my feelings. In those 3.5 years, I cried only once. During major life events (like losing a loved one) I felt nothing. The two reasons I decided to stop this medication were because it didn't help to achieve a more ""happy"" state and I gained 20lbs. I started this medication weighing 120 and am now at 140. Healthy eating habits and exercise have always been part of my routine so the weight gain could not be attributed to a sloppy lifestyle. I could no longer deal with the weight gain. The weight SLOWLY came. 5lbs at first was not that big of a deal, but when I could no longer fit into my clothes I'd had enough.",Danielle
12,Escitalopram,Depression,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 2, 2022",0,"After struggling with depression and anxiety it was the best I've ever been so I absolutely loved escitalopram and thought I had no side effects. It made me semi-functional which made it look like it works and it's great but it's not. It severely damaged the quality of my life for the last 5 years and it took me a while to understand that.There is not a single person who will not experience side effects. The most destabilizing are fatigue, excessive sleeping, brain fog, indifference, restrained range and intensity of emotion (I barely had any), decreased sexual sensitivity (delayed ejaculation), weight gain. It's absolutely not a fix and I don't know why such a damaging drug has become so popular. If I could give myself advice years ago I would say don't take it. Research other drugs and stay away from SSRIs. Quitting after long-term use can damage you and leave you with withdrawal symptoms for months and in some cases permanently. I am tapering over 9-12 months.",Anonymous

I started at 5mg, upped to 10mg when I had no (noticeable) side effects. Shortly after being upped to 10mg I felt like a shell of myself. My personality feels different - more hollow, I do more stupid things when interacting with people and I don't feel as much anymore. For the first time in my life, I can say that I've had no suicidal thoughts beyond extremely passive 'kill yourself' '...no' exchanges in my brain. It's helped a lot with my anxiety (working on a GAD diagnosis), but I still have no motivation for anything. I guess I'm more sociable, but more awkward and less... organic? I had a breakdown a few weeks ago about how this medication makes me feel less like me, but I'm still taking it because I don't want to worry my family. TLDR: it does what it's supposed to, I just don't like how it changes my personality and makes me disassociate from myself.",anonymous
16,Escitalopram,Depression,3.0,,"December 8, 2021",3,"Lexapro (escitalopram):I really regret taking this. I went on a low dose of it for anxiety, and the side effects at the beginning were tremendous. It was like having the stomach flu for weeks, and I was so sleepy and tired and foggy. But eventually, it worked. I felt happy again and the anxiety was manageable. However, it slowly seemed to lose effect over the months, and I was back to being irritable, but with a side of tired (which is kind of extreme because I'm on Wellbutrin, which has a stimulating effect). I couldn't take being tired all the time, so I weaned slowly off of it but still had discontinuation syndrome. It was a nightmare. After weeks of weaning, I slowly began to feel physically normal, but it's like my brain can't remember how to make serotonin anymore. I'm not a crier, but I cry all day everyday. I'm so miserable but I'm afraid of going back on any SSRI after this, it feels like a trap. I've never experienced this with Wellbutrin, citalopram, or Prozac. I wish I'd never taken this.",Regret

I had previously tried Wellbutrin and it made me feel absolutely horrible. As a last resort my doctor prescribed lexapro, I started at 5mg for the first week and then went up to 10mg which I stayed at for just over a year. It helped my depression and anxiety more than I can describe, and I don’t remember suffering from any awful side effects. I may have gained a little weight, but I was also taking another medication so I’m not sure which it was. Anyways, lexapro gave me my life back without debilitating anxiety and depression. It’s worth a try if you’re struggling. I have since weaned down to 5mg with no side effects, and I plan to discontinue the medication at my next check up in three months as I am in a good place mentally now. I hope this review helps someone who may be hesitant about trying it. I know how hard it is to be struggling and scared to try a new medication.",Kayleigh23

I barely remember the last six years of my life and the withdrawal process has been absolutely terrible. I’ve read that for some people they don’t feel normal for over a year after they stop taking the drug. For the past two months I have been crying at everything, experiencing insane anger that I’ve never felt before, and generally feel like I’m not really here. I couldn’t cry when I was on lexapro which was really frustrating sometimes but now I can’t stop!! Hoping some day I will be at peace. 5 because at least I am alive",biscuit

I have never dealt with stuff like this before (was 22 years old at this time)After 6 months I felt really happy and decided to go off it.

20,Escitalopram,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 14, 2021",3,"So I thought I would give an update.  I started escitalopram in mid-August 2021.  I was on Paxil for over 20 years and it stopped working.  So I tapered off Paxil and started escitalopram at 5mg for 1 week.  Then went to 10mg for about 3 weeks.  Then my Dr. upped my dose to 15mg.  Its been over 7 weeks on 15mg and I feel better.  The anxiety reduced fairly quickly but the depress mood takes longer.  I'm not back to 100% but feel better.  I had side effects like insomnia, headache, brain fog and nausea.  Those went away after a few weeks.  Brain fog took longer.  I find escitalopram works very slowly.  You have to be patient.  But I am feeling a lot better now than I did in August.  Be patient.  I know its hard but stick with it.  Some people get quick relief.  It took me longer and I'm still improving every day.

She prescribed me 10mg and told me to give it a few weeks. When I tell you I noticed a difference in DAYS. Obviously not the case for most, but this med was exactly what my brain needed.

26,Escitalopram,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 14, 2021",3,"I took Lexapro before (20MG) and I was feeling flat. No emotion whatsoever. That was worse than the depression and anxiety. So I went off it. Then I tried Remeron, and gained 20 pounds despite 90 minutes of exercise a day. So I started weaning off the Remeron and added back in only 5 MG of Lexapro. Within a week I was feeling so much better. The anxiety was lifted so I slept better. I didn't have the flat affect either. It was like a light went on so I went up to 10MG of Lexapro because I thought, more is better. Boy was I wrong. The lethargy, constant yawning, and extreme tiredness, despite a good nights sleep was awful. Enter in depression again when I went swimming, which I love, but was unable to motivate myself to even swim a lap. Now I am going back to 5MG which is considered ""low dose"", but I don't care. Everyone is different and 10 MG was too much for me. Listen to your body, it will not lie to you, no matter what the doctors say. Hopefully I will return to the light at 5 MG.",Shoff

I've been on Zoloft, Paxil, Prozac, & Celexa. Celexa is in the same medicine family as Lexapro, but is milder. I maxed out the highest dosage on Celexa for awhile, & was still feeling pretty bad, and stressed out about different situations going on in my personal life. Lexapro has been the medicine that works for me. I found that Lexapro (Escitolapram Oxalate) had made me feel a little weird at first, for a few weeks, like tired and drowsy. I figured out to take my pill at bedtime since it made me tired. By the 3rd-4th week, I was feeling like a new person. I felt happier, like I wanted to do the things that I used to avoid, even more. Lexapro actually helps me sleep, & wakes me up too, after 7-8 hrs. of sleep. I feel that it has been a great fit for me. I've been on Lexapro for 6 1/2 yrs. now.

So my GP and I agreed to try Cipralex (escitalopram). For the first 2 weeks I crossed tapered between Paxil and escitalopram.  My GP gave 10mg for 2 weeks and then wanted me to go to 20mg. But after talking to him we agreed that I would stay on 10mg for at least 6 weeks to see if it will work. Escitalopram can take 6 to 8 weeks to « kick in ». So this is week 4 on 10mg and I can feel it start working. Anxiety is gone for the most part and mood is improving. After reading reviews here I realized it take time for escitalopram to take full effect. I was also diagnosed as pre diabetic while I was on Paxil and prescribed diabetes medication.

I feel a joy for life that I can never remember ever feeling before, I have energy, I don’t cry every day, I am kicking goals at work, my social life is enriched and I can focus properly. I didn’t realise that I was living in a constant state of anxiety until it went away. If you are considering antidepressants, my best advice is to try them.

40,Escitalopram,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 17, 2021",1,So I have been on Paxil for years and last year at this time I wanted to get off of it so my GP started reducing my dose. I was on 30mg. When I got down to 10mg my depression and GAD came back. So I increased back my dose. But I felt like I did not come back to my self. Anxiety and depression was still there. So after suffering through I talked to my GP and we agreed to try escitalopram. I did a taper of my Paxil for 3 weeks then I started taking 5mg escitalopram with 10mg of Paxil for a week. Now today I started 10mg of escitalopram with no Paxil. Anxiety is still there and having trouble sleeping. But will see. I will give an update in a few weeks to see,Nanics

Regularly I feel like I’m on the verge of crying for no reason (I never cry). I cannot focus or relax. I became less productive than before. Positive: Got pleasure from simple things and my sense of smell became more vivid. However, it’s only after intense negative effects of the drug wear off. And even then, I need to push myself, for example, hike/work all day. But it's getting more difficult to push myself and I've been pretty much useless.

It hasn't ruined my sex drive or ability to orgasm, I still laugh at everything, I feel a full spectrum of emotions. No numbing feeling in any regard that many have expressed, thankfully. its a low dosage but I am young and a smaller person so it works just fine for me.

83,Escitalopram,Depression,8.0,,"January 17, 2021",16,"Lexapro (escitalopram):I’m in my early 30s. This was my first time taking antidepressants after struggling with depression and anxiety since I was a teenager. It did a great job of managing my depression and anxiety. It took the edge off and evened me out emotionally. I stopped being irritable and snapping at all those around me, I didn’t sweat the small stuff, and I didn’t get stuck in negative thought patterns. I no longer had intrusive thoughts. It made me a better person. There is a downside: the weight gain. In the first 8 months of being on Lexapro I put on 20 pounds. Over the next 12 months I put on an additional 22 lbs, and was tipping the scales at 212lbs, 42lbs more than my normal weight. When I started outgrowing size large shirts I decided that enough was enough and stopped taking Lexapro. Within 6 months I was back to 170lbs and I didn’t change anything about my eating habits or workouts. If anything I was eating way worse than before.

However, the initial 13 days were challenging. V sleepy (pill at 8am), anxious/jittery. On days 8-13 I felt more depressed and cried constantly, questioning how a drug could make me feel worse. My jaw was clamping and appetite zero. Sleep improved tho. Suddenly, on days 14 and 15, I felt calm, smiling genuinely for the first time in weeks. 100% authentically me. Not drugged, depressed, over-excitable or anxious. I’ve returned to work and socialise. Jaw-clamping gone and appetite back. Slight impact on libido.

219,Escitalopram,Depression,10.0,,"May 18, 2019",16,"Overall I am quite pleased with the escitalopram working to improve my quality of life from depression. Essentially I suffered with what I believed was simply chronic insomnia. It all came to a head, when at 50 years of age, I was let go from my job due to poor performance. I was isolating myself at home, had no patience with my family, and started drinking more than I should. After an extensive conversation with my PCP, he diagnosed me with depression and generalized anxiety. Quite a blow. Escitalopram at 10 mg  dose has given me back myself, it has worked for the depression and anxiety. I’m at a new job, looking forward to each day. I’m a better husband, father, son, brother and friend. I no longer see the glass as half empty; I just see a glass with water in it. I’m at about 60 days in; For how long it took for the escitalopram to start working - I’d say my sleep improved around 3 weeks, and with my depression I began to feel better closer to four weeks. No significant sides effects. I don’t like the idea of a chronic med, but I now understand that the insomnia was merely the symptom of what was chronic depression and anxiety.",Rdpop

In my early 30's because of high blood pressure problems I also admitted to the depression. The doctor tried a few different anti depressants. The side effects of them dry mouth, headaches, weird dreams and I had no mood improvement, so I gave up on them. Years later, after a major life crisis I tried again. Escitalopram had virtually none of the side effects I struggled with from earlier experiences and worked for my depression. I noticed a difference in my mood. After several years I decided, since the crisis was over, I felt ""stable"" so I asked the doctor to wean me off the medication. Within a 10 days, I asked him to remind me to NEVER let me do that again! I noticed a HUGE difference! It was a good reminder, showing me how much it really did help.",tdwillis

The other side of Lexapro is it's ability to increase interest in life activities. There are more pros to Lexapro than cons. An added benefit is that it builds up your inner strength to navigate through anxiety. It also mysteriously decreases interest in sex, which is not always a bad thing. Lexapro isn't physically energizing. It's more sedating, but also not great for insomnia. The best part of Lexapro is that it works for many months maybe many years and buys you plenty of time to adjust your life to make it better.

I was no longer crying, aimless, no more low mood, very active .The most important thing is I developed severe INSOMNIA, and it was hard to get sleep. Maximum of my sleep was 3 hours at night. I suffered sleepless nights but would be active in the morning. My doctor tried a few sedatives with me and nothing worked. A last resort was to let my body deal with it. so I get a full nights sleep every 4th night and other nights I sleep 2-3 hrs.

I have suffered from bad depression since my teens (I’m now 29) and also anxiety. I’ve had therapy for years which was helpful but never managed to get the depression under control. I was beginning to think I’d never shake it. My GP convinced me to start taking 5mg Lexapro 3 months ago and within days I found I FINALLY had some reprieve from the constant feeling of despair I used to sink into. I have not felt the need to increase my dose yet - and the only major side effect was extreme lethargy for the first month. I am content for the first time in years. I feel like this drug has made me who I really am without the weight of depression - and the tools given to me in therapy now have a chance to be applied now I’m not being hijacked by my emotions.

It was a rough start at first. I found myself crying and honestly feeling worse.  The first glimpse of it working came in around six weeks.  I was scared to believe it. These days I have a happier base level. I do not feel overly happy or out of touch with my emotions. Actually have the ability to feel all of my emotions and not try to run from them.  I still struggle with some loop thinking but it is not as bad as it was.  Overall I am so incredibly grateful for this drug in my life. I coupled it with talk therapy and that made a huge difference to have someone tracking my progress and being a sounding board as I transitioned through the side affects.
