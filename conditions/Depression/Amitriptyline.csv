1,Amitriptyline,Depression,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 13, 2022",0,Amitriptyline 150MG once daily every night when he goes to bed is a life saver and helps him with his daily chronic depression disorder and daily chronic anxiety disorder.  He takes it with his anxiety medication Busprione 10MG three times in the morning and afternoon and night and he gets the complete total daily protection with both medications everyday. They really help a lot and says goodbye to his daily depression and daily anxiety and if it wasn't for Amitriptyline and Busprione it would be really difficult to get through his days especially with this crazy COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic crisis this world has been going through 24/7  for nearly 2 years already. I think COVID-19 is going to be the daily normal thing that everyone is going to have face day to day for the rest of there life everyday and pray that this COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic crisis would go away for life and forever!!!,Anonymous

As is typical, I was on Lexapro for 7 weeks which made me feel worse. Switched to Effexor for 4 days and stopped as the side effects were unbearable so I totally come off antidepressants. I continue to be miserable and nauseous all the time. Finally I see gastroenterologist who diagnosed me with a functional GI disorder due to anxiety and prescribes Amitryptyline 10 mg and nausea is gone but my depression is still continuing as I have been dealing with this for months and although not nauseous all other symptoms exist. I slowly increase by 5 mg each week. The depression was awful but I persisted with the plan and by 30 mg the cloud began to finally lift. I’m at 35 mg now and I actually feel normal when I never thought I would ever feel normal again just a couple weeks earlier.  Thank god for my gastroenterologist because my psych wouldn’t have even tried Amitryptyline. Thank God for this drug. It saved me.",Anonymous

Small talk seems impossible, where you feel this unimaginable anxiety and ""what do I say next"" is in the back of your head.I tried so much medication : paxil, laxepro, mirtazapine, wellbutrin, brintellix. None seem to work. As cliche as it sound, I decided to try amitriptyline as last hope. In two weeks I started feeling a change.

8,Amitriptyline,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 30, 2021",4,When I was 15 I was diagnosed with depression but being so young I refused to take medicine. This year has been the toughest year for me and I found myself in a really bad state of mind. My doctor prescribed me 10mg of Amitriptyline for my headaches and said it’ll help with depression too. I never felt the way I felt after taking this. The past 8 years I don’t think I ever went a day without telling myself I’m so depressed. I’ve only been on this medicine since May but it has made me feel better. Up until recently I started to feel down again for no reason. Maybe I need to up the dosage. Either way I’m so lucky to have started this medicine and have gotten no side effects. I truly felt like I was about to live a normal life for the past two months :),bluebunnyxo

Me = 47 year old male, long term depression/anxiety sufferer.I would always find that the common SSRI meds I tried in the past would ease my depression & anxiety, but not actually get rid of it fully enough so that I felt 'normal'. Then I tried amitriptyline (75mg a day) & for the first time in about 10 years,  ALL depression/and anxiety, gone!Unfortunately I'm getting a side effect: 'tachycardia', which means this med is making my heart beat too fast. I was just sunbathing in the garden, totally relaxed, & even then my heart was beating way over 100 bpm.  Note: a very common side effect which I get from amitriptyline, is dry mouth.

I refuse to wear underwear with these particular pants as I enjoy how they accentuate my shall I say fruits and vegetables . Anyhoo you can imagine the sheer terror and embarrassment when I dropped a steamy, extremely foul smelling deuce right there on the dance floor.

I started on 25mg, then 50mg, 75mg and 100mg on the fourth week. I now feel like my normal self. Mirtazapine just sedated me too much and gives you a ridiculously high appetite.

Even tried suboxone it worked for almost 1 year. Amitryptyline sedating effects don't exactly wear off.  They completely go away and its almost like the sedative effects slowly transform into energy and wellbeing which I think is good because while its sedating it allows your body to rest and repair itself while catching up on sleep.

Once I started on amitriptyline (for depression) I even started working part-time. From the very beginning I felt that it works much better for my major recurrent depressive  disorder. First of all - much more energy comparing to  escitalopram (esc.) that I had taken before.My friend also tried amitriptyline after being on esc. , and found out that even in small dosage like 50 mg daily is more efficient than esc.Important! It decreased my sexual energy - I needed it so desperately because had nobody to have sex with!I received amitriptyline 5 years later than I started needing it! Particularly because of side effects that make doctors prescribe it only in cases when newer antidepressants don't work enough.So anyway if you have long and strong depression -  I highly recommend trying it.

This had increased his mood swings and cyclothymia to unmanageable proportions!!UK doctor prescribed 10mg amitriptyline, to be taken at night 2 hours before bed. After two weeks this was increased to 20mg per night.The effect has been nothing short of miraculous.He sleeps really well for 7-8 hours a night, wakes refreshed & cheerful.It's helped him cope differently with depression - staying calm & getting CBT therapy.

Restless, sleepless nights and all the anxiety and depression were killing me.  And then I found Amitriptyline.    At last.....Sleep.   That's all that mattered to begin with.  You simply cannot underestimate the power of sleep.  During the day I felt far less agitated and less stressed.  Of course life can still throw slings and arrows your way and there are side effects for sure but none as bad as the frazzled state I was in before I took them.",It Works

I don't fall asleep right away but I do sleep and have a good nights sleep. I feel better in general, not moody like I used to be. Along with anxiety I must have had mild depression.

I still have some problems with memory in forgetting where I put things. The best thing that happened is I have not had a headache in 20 years.
