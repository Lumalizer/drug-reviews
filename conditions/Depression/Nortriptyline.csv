1,Nortriptyline,Depression,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 28, 2021",9,"I have been on Welbutrin since 2014 and buspirone was added in 2019 for my depression/anxiety/OCD. I also have an autoimmune disease that causes severe neuropathy and migraines. I take other medications for that, but they have been insufficient. My neurologist prescribed this to help further treat my neuropathy and it DID work. I had no idea how bad my migraines were until nortriptyline reduced them almost down to nothing, unfortunately it made my depression much, much worse, and I also spent several days very, very angry. We tried both the 25mg and 10mg dose. After stopping the medication it took about 2-3 days to be back to my previous normal. I wish the negative effects hadn’t been so severe, because it worked great for pain.",JHarrisford
2,Nortriptyline,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 4, 2021",4,I had been using Desipramine for depression since 1995 and it had worked very well for me.  In 2020 it was changed to a Tier 4 drug so I decided to try something else that was less expensive.  My doctor recommended Nortriptyline (Tier 3) and I began taking it four weeks ago.  I am 72 years old and in the last four weeks I have developed a SEVERE case of adult cystic acne !!! Enough Nortriptyline for me.,Yorkie Girl

4,Nortriptyline,Depression,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 29, 2020",4,"I’ve taken SSRIs for many years to control anxiety but got depression the past year after a few stressful events. My dr couldn’t increase my SSRI anymore as I’m on max dose so she added on nortrip as apparently the combo is really good. I started on 20mg but was still struggling with insomnia from my depression so it was increased to 40mg. It’s wonderful and I no longer feel any depression. However, the side effects of TCA’s are much more noticeable to me than SSRI’s which is really frustrating. I get constipated, dry mouth, bad sunburn and sun sensitivity and cannot tolerate any more than two alcoholic drinks. Doesn’t make summer holidays very fun lol. However, it does work very very well. I’d say better than SSRIs. So I’m going to stay on it but I do hope to come off it one day unlike my SSRI (escitalopram) which I will happily stay on as I get no side effects.",Sallyjoy

8,Nortriptyline,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 31, 2020",7,"nortriptyline works great for TRD (treatment resistant depression).  Gave me a break from the relentless nightmare I was experiencing.  Seemed to not do much for anxiety at all, and maybe even make it a bit worse.  Side effects were not fun though: inability to lose weight, softening of pecs, heart flutters, dry skin, migraines anything above 25mg, and brutal sun sensitivity.  Like absurdly bad sun sensitivity.  SPF100 to walk to the mailbox and back and still have red swollen cheeks twenty minutes later.  Ultimately had to discontinue due to this as I can't sit in the dark forever.  But worked better than any SSRIs/SNRIs by faaar.",rando

I had a very bad experience with these pills.Whenever I had an episodeThey would up the dose,I started at 1-25mg tabletEvery morning, within the year I was taking 5-25mgTablet a day. Because of this I missed out on a lot of things. I was wondering around so much that I was getting lost, didn't know who I was, or where I was going, where I was supposed to be. I was just blah. Stuck in my thoughts and I hated every minute of it. But it was not my choice.I have nerve problem to this day, sometimes I get to shaking so bad that I drop anything in my hands, it's very hard to eat soup or drink coffee when I spill it all over myself.When I turned 18 it then was my choice, and I stopped taking them all together. A lot of my childhood was missed because of the pills, but on the flip side of it I didn't get beat for having an episode as much as I did when I wasn't taking them.",Nedrub

I was honestly considering ECT... I asked my psychiatrist if we could try a tricyclic in a last ditch effort... he put me on Nortriptyline a year ago. I'm now up to 100mg at bedtime, but this antidepressant has helped me more than anything had in 7 years, and no weight gain or bad side effects for me.",Flutter

I once had a bad reaction to Trintillex . Without having much recollection of why I decided to start this new med I did. I felt ECT was starting to heal my depression. As a few weeks passed,  I noticed major daytime fatigue. Also EVERY night I would experience irrational fear and panic, also had a few panic attacks at night which has not happened for me in years. Constipation , vomiting , worsening depression, thoughts of self harm . It took me way too long to figure out nortriptyline was the culprit of all this. I was on this medicine for about two months and am in the process of weaning off. If you notice similar symptoms speak up to your doctor ASAP.",Eric G

Which I never experienced with any SSRI.Phenelzine also has this side effect but less than NortriptylineIf it wont give me any relief in 2 weeks for my depression and anxiety my doctor will put back to Nardil / Phenelzine 90mg,This has very few side effects and at least gives decent positive effect.",Cml

I do have dry mouth as a side effect but it is very worth it in comparison to the benefits that it brings.Prior to starting nortriptyline I experienced a number of secondary symptoms caused by my anxiety:  insomnia,  headaches, and loss of appetite.   In addition to reducing my anxiety, I now sleep well every night,  no longer have frequent headaches, and I have an appetite that allows me to keep my weight at a healthy spot (I was too thin before).   These things seem to help my immune system too because I seem to be much better at fighting off/avoiding colds than before I was on this medication.So in summary:  This medication helped address my anxiety and a bunch of secondary symptoms that I hadn’t realized were anxiety related.  On this medication I feel happier and healthier than ever before.",PH

16,Nortriptyline,Depression,10.0,,"November 17, 2019",54,"This was super-effective for both severe treatment resistant depression, anxiety, chronic vestibular migraines, panic attacks and even helped a bit with social anxiety and OCD. Never had such remarkable effects from any other drug before, even with SSRIs/SNRIs(which made depression worse) and MAOIs. I started feeling better the very first day and within a few days I had old emotions back that I hadn't experienced in years. Unfortunately I developed a drug allergy to this drug, but it is not the drug's fault but my immune system. The drug still gets a 10/10, and I will be trying another TCA soon hoping it works just as well!Also don't worry about the anticholinergic effects of this medicine/other TCAs the anticholinergic side-effects of this medicine can actually be of benefit in treating your depression and should rather be called ""effects"" than ""side-effects"" and embraced and accepted as being potentially positive.",TCA Enthusiast
17,Nortriptyline,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 25, 2019",42,I was hospitalized for depression recently after many hospitalizations. I have tried almost all of SSRIs & the only one that slightly helped was Wellbutrin. It stopped working for me in the last year along with lithium. I was prescribed nortriptyline in hospital starting at 10 mg up to 100 mg. Shortly after the 100 mg I experienced a feeling of being on speed. The surge of rage taking over me and caused so many panic attacks. After a visit to ER it was reduced to 85 mg. After a couple of days on 85 mg of nortriptyline I felt like my old self again.  In disbelief my lack of motivation was gone and I experienced my old self. So far it has been a week and I feel very good. I hope this lasts as I’ve been experiencing treatment resistant depression for 4 years now. Let’s hope this tricyclics antidepressant is the answer for me.,Vothene

20,Nortriptyline,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 16, 2019",16,"Nortriptyline is a great medication and is one of the only meds that don't numb my emotions completely. In fact, I noticed I was more attuned to things like tv shows and books rather than feeling completely apathetic. You really should get your genes/SNPs tested before you take this to make sure you're a normal metabolizer; if not, it may not work for you at all (ultrarapid metabolizer) or you could have too many side effects (poor metabolizer). If you're doctor is worth his/her salt, he will also take a blood level of nortriptyline to determine you're within the therapeutic window for optimal effects. I highly recommend this medication as a first or second choice after SSRIs even though it didn't quite work out for me because it made a preexisting health condition worse. It's also very cheap.",dordeduh

This side effect went away within a few months. I have a bit of dry mouth and I believe I suffered some hair loss. I was most troubled by the hair loss because I am pretty vain.

After many years, my doctor had me try some of the newer SSRI drugs (while still on Nortriptyline) and with each one I didn't feel at all like myself (like I was watching my life from outside myself), so with each attempt at trying a new drug, I kept going back to what worked best.

I have had a very hard time sleeping, my brain just over thinks all the time, I am a retired I.T director, automation designer and engineer, so I guess it's just a problem with high IQ. Anyway my Neuro started me out on nortriptyline 25mg. I could tell, it was doing some good but still not sleeping. Taking Ambien just was not cutting it. Last week my doctor put me on 50 mg and for the first time in years I slept all night long. I was amazed! I normally eat dinner late, so I have to take it. Before I eat or it does not work.",Scadarick

When I do go to sleep I have very vivid dreams seems almost realistic.",M.A.R

I started taking nortriptyline and noticed a number of changes within 24 hours. I finally slept through the night.  My back pain dramatically improved and my anxiety lessened.  Sounds amazing right?  Well yes, but I was also crying all the time and felt even more depressed.  I also began having bad thoughts about hurting myself.  I have had bad thoughts in the past, but always had control of them.  These felt very different, I had no control of them.  For some people this medicine is a miracle, but if you start to have thoughts that don%u2019t feel right when you start taking this medication, go to your doctor immediately.",Anonymous
