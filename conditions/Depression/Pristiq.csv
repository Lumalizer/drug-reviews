0,Pristiq,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 29, 2022",0,"I would not be here without Pristiq. I've been on it for about a year now, but within the first month I knew I had found the one. I honestly had/have no side effects, but I know from experience (from the multitude of other meds I had to try before I found this one) that meds affect everyone differently. The only downside is that when I forget to take it for 2-3 days, I get ""brain zaps"", but thats the only symptom. Anyways, I would have not fallen back in love with life if it wasn't for Pristiq. to anyone reading this, it took me months and months to find this med, I was miserable, it felt like torture to live. I wanted to give up. I was so close to giving up, but I didn't, and I found something that fit like a puzzle piece. I am so sorry that you are still searching for your puzzle piece, but please please don't give up.",brookie

2,Pristiq,Depression,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2022",1,I have been on Pristiq for 6 days. I am jittery and have no appetite. Still taking Ativan to stop the nervous stomach. Cry everyday. I took a gene test and this drug is supposed to work. Fingers crossed it does. Do I have a chance to every be myself again. Hard to rate it because I am still having side effects.,Franny
3,Pristiq,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 16, 2022",1,Took about 6 months to actually kick in but once it did it’s been great. No side effects on 50 mg and feel so good! Would recommend this drug to anyone struggling with depression.,Anonymous

5,Pristiq,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 1, 2022",0,"I was so nervous to begin taking Pristiq, I anxiously read through all of these reviews, getting myself to focus on the positive outcomes.I have both depression and anxiety. I started on 50mg, I could feel the impact quickly. I had a tense jaw, sore ears, nausea, fatigue and abdominal pain. When you have the side effects, it can feel like it won’t pass. Hang in there, it will pass, drink a lot of water for the dry throat and nausea, rest whenever you can. I found 50mg wasn’t enough for my depression, so I’ve increased to 100mg. It is too early to say if this will make a significant difference as I’m getting better through the side effects again. I wanted to write this review though because I know once I’m well I will forget! I’m going to rate this highly, because I want to give others hope! And I did feel it do something, even if I’m still trying to find the correct dose. If you are suffering and everything in life feels hard, give it a go!",LittleMissWA
6,Pristiq,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 17, 2022",1,"I have an extreme panic attack disorder and was on Paxil for about a year and half which worked wonders. Only downside was I gained a ton of weight so went off it for about a year. Anxiety came back so was forced to go back on meds but wanted to try something different since the weight was an issue for me. Started pristiq (50mg) about 6 days ago and today I’m feeling great! Less anxious but still waiting for the depression to subside. First few days on it weren’t bad, dizziness, loss of appetite, just kind of out of it. Side effects are starting to get better everyday. My sleep is so much better as well, improved only 2 days after taking it. This is definitely a fast acting anxiety medication compared to many others on the market. Starting 100 mg in about another week.",Chichi

After 8 weeks I had enough so I told doctor.  I was on 100mg morning 50mg at night told doctor and was told to taper off.",Jj1970
8,Pristiq,Depression,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 4, 2021",0,I have been on Pristiq for about 4 weeks now and it has given me rapid heart beat and nervousness at times. I asked the doctor for something to take the edge off. So doctor said its not working for me so I have to wean my self off Pristiq and go back onto Zoloft that was working for me until I had a relapse. So its a score of about 1 for me they are suppose improve after a couple of week to a month instead it has given more anxiety and made it worse. Never again will I be taking this,Jj1970
9,Pristiq,Depression,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 2, 2021",5,"Taken 50mg of Pristiq for 3.5 years, and it saved my life! Anxiety and mood issues since I was a child. I had a massive breakdown in 2018, I had to get over my fear of taking medication, for the first time ever! Should have done it years ago, within 2 weeks of taking this medication, my head calmed down for the first time in my entire life! I finally was able to control my anxiety/ mood, drink less, function better, and feel hope for the first time ever. My life is great now, and it saved my marriage. Only thing is, I've never missed one day in 3.5 years! I’m thinking of trying to come off, but my wife doesn’t want me to. I just don’t want to be dependant on it forever. Any advice?

10,Pristiq,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 28, 2021",3,"I would recommend starting at the lowest dose 25MG for at least two months and increase from there as needed.

11,Pristiq,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 26, 2021",4,"I have Borderline Personality Disorder/Depression and have tried about 6 anti-depressants before Pristiq, as well as TMS therapy (which I do recommend), and other unconventional methods. Pristiq is AMAZING! I had such low expectations but wow. I love it so much. I struggle with holding onto grudges/bad thoughts in the moment. Pristiq makes it so much easier for my brain to move on from one topic to the next instead of dwelling in a black hole. Medications aren't for everyone, and I thought they weren't for me. I am so glad I tried this. Minimal side effects. I have a bit of loss of appetite (which is great because I was previously an emotional binge eater, and now I just eat normally. My sex drive has stayed the same. It's a lovely drug. I am so grateful. I was prescribed 50mg daily which ended up being too much, that amount made me a little paranoid and too chatty (a bit like Adderall?) I didn't like it, so I just take 25 mg a day now. And some days I skip it. I like that it works instantly for me each day (which isn't common I hear?)",Tinkerbell
12,Pristiq,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 12, 2021",4,"I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember. I never knew life without panic and worry. I did therapy for year (spot therapy) just to bring my anxiety down enough to try and live a normal life. One day my brain broke. I was scared of everything, I couldn't drive, couldn't work. I thought I had to go to the hospital for help. I've never wanted to take meds (for whatever reason). My doctor put me on Pristiq. It was a but tough at the beginning. I felt uncomfortable mentally and couldn't sleep but I felt more calm right away. Then one day it all stopped and I was living life. I've never known a life without constant worry. I feel amazing. I'd like to try and get off the meds in about 8 months as I rebuild myself. I'd recommend trying it but really, it only will work for some of us. Good luck on your journey.",B1r2i3t
13,Pristiq,Depression,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 5, 2021",2,"I don't like this drug. I switched to it thinking it would be better than Cymbalta, but it was not! I am done with these awful drugs and big pharma trying to make money of others misery! I had nausea, sexual side effects, my menstrual cycle changed, night sweats, hot all the time, anxiety, weight gain, etc....! It is not worth it. The side effects are worse than any depression ever was! Not too mention, all it did was make me numb. I am proud to say I have been off of this for almost a week.

14,Pristiq,Depression,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 22, 2021",2,"Took Citalopram for 5 years and think it lost efficacy. Doctor switched me to desvenlafexine after tapering off the citalopram, during which I had suicidal intrusive thoughts and feelings and felt very odd. I've been on just the desvenlafexine now for about a month and noticed I'm a lot more emotional. I cry now when I normally would not. I rarely ever cry so I don't like it. I also missed a dose the other night and woke up the next morning feeling dizzy, brain fogged, and just sick. I couldn't take the missed dose because it knocks me out and I had to work. Well I was so sick I ended up going home early anyway. I was very, very sick, just from missing one dose. I was also very emotional and cried and cried toward the end of the day either from feeling so sick or from being emotional from missing the dose. I took it that night and woke up the next morning fine. I really don't like that there is no room to miss a dose ever or I'll either be messed up all day or knocked out all day.",napqueen967
15,Pristiq,Depression,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 20, 2021",2,"I have adhd, depression, and anxiety. I can’t remember how long I’ve been taking pristiq but it’s been longer than 6 months and shorter than 2 years. Time is relative. Anyway, I take it with Wellbutrin and adderral. When I first started it I noticed that my cravings for alcohol decreased immediately. That wonderful part didn’t last long but it was easier to stop drinking later on while on pristiq. I have read that only 50 mg should be taken and not 100mg. I read there is no increase in effectiveness after 50mg, although my dr has suggested it and I tried it. I was paranoid about it so I had him go back to 50mg so I’m not sure if it’s even better at 100mg. Since I have no real opinion on pristiq as far as positive or negative, I would say it’s doing it’s job. I haven’t had those dark thoughts in quite a while. It’s prob a life saver.",CalmStormy

Everyone is different but if your situation sounds similar to me this could be a medication that works for you. My mood has gone from a 3 being my regular mood and a 5 being my happy to everyday being no less than a 7/8. It helps with my anxiety for sure but I still do have anxiety .

I had been using lorazepam 0.25 mgs as needed for anxiety for several months before having a mental breakdown and deciding it was time to manage this daily anxiety instead of the up and down rollercoaster I was on with the lorazepam.  I developed agoraphobia and could barely make myself get out of bed the first week. I was scared to be alone and at age 46 found myself asking my mom to stay with me while my husband was at work. This went on for weeks. I did notice my depression improved after 2-3 weeks. I was disappointed that it had not improved my anxiety as much as I thought it should but then that switch finally flipped for me on day 56.  Side effects: headache, loss of appetite, tinnitus, fatigue, dizziness.  Just tinnitus has stuck. Small price to pay for getting my life back. It’s no joke that it takes 6-8 weeks for relief. Take the pill. Everyday. Feel better.",Anonymous

The most annoying thing for me is that I sweat a LOT more than usual. I tend to sweat but now it’s much worse. I also don’t think it’s helped much. I did not know that I would have to be gradually taken off of it. While I didn’t have severe withdrawal symptoms, I did have dizziness and a feeling like electrical impulses going off in my head when I accidentally failed to take it for two days in a row. I started taking it again and they went away. I have asked to be gradually taken off of it. I’ve also had worse anxiety at times.",EJK

Anyway I'm now on Pristiq and the fog has lifted. You forget how good life can be when you're in the spirals of depression. But be active in your care and keep trying different meds because one day you'll succeed. I think Pristiq is my 6th attempt at finding my happy place. For some of us there is a family history and a very real reason we are depressed.

28,Pristiq,Depression,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 22, 2021",13,"3 years ago, I started taking Pristiq. Had to stop for a year after new job insurance declined to pay for it. Just got back on it and now I realize how useful it was as a med.Immediately, I noticed muscle pain all over including my chest when I started taking it 3 years ago. I was much more emotional and positive after taking Pristiq for about a week or so, but I'm sure the lamotrigine was preventing any mood swings.Pristiq makes me sweat like crazy!It was harder to achieve orgasm if you take a higher dose. However, my BuSpar negates the effect considerably so my sex life is still (thankfully) intact. It beats Effexor in this regard.The muscle pain goes away in a month or so. The teeth grinding goes to a minimum with time. After one week starting at 100mg (terrible idea BTW but really didn't want to taper off of Cymbalta) I still have the muscle pain but I'm kissing my spouse a lot more and I'm looking toward the future positively.

I took pristiq 50mg for 4 weeks and I only had 1 day that I was not depressed. I quit taking it after 4 weeks of sleepless nights and a very loud high pitched ringing in my head. 2 weeks of feeling dizzy and extreme headaches, then 2 months of bad headaches and extreme anxiety. Now 4 months off prisitq I have very high anxiety, headaches, and the worst is tinnitus. Pristiq ruined my life. After researching I realize that this tinnitus is probably not going away, since it has been 4 months, and I am devastated.

They said it would be fine, went home took a klonopin panicked some more laid on my couch until I passed out, woke up feeling like I partied at the biggest frat house party in the world.

I should have stopped taking it the first week when I couldn’t sleep and had zero appetite from stomach pains.  I began taking it in the fall of 2018 when Lamictal started giving me mood swings. Once I got past the first month, I thought all was good. Since then, I have been out of work three different times for weeks with severe dizziness and fatigue. Come to find out this medication was causing my blood pressure to significantly drop!  Apparently with this you have to increase your sodium intake because this can happen (if you already run on the low side). I’ve put on weight from the lack of energy, and  weaning off of it is like no other because you can NOT cut it.

I then got GeneSite testing done to find out which drugs metabolize for me best. Pristiq was on my good list so we tried it. I started in on Dec 9 and still felt depressed through Christmas. I had constipation, insomnia, and night sweats. I didn’t think it was going to work but then on Jan 4 I woke up and felt like myself again for the first time in years. Right around that time I got approved for TMS treatment and wanted to do it without any antidepressants so I ended up going off of it.

I have been trying to get off this drug for the past few months. The first step was reducing my dose from 100mg to 50mg which I managed to do without too much difficulty. After achieving this, I started to skip one pill each week, then two etc. This process was the most difficult. Skipping one pill was okay. But skipping two has led to a range of unpleasant symptoms including brain zaps, paresthesia, hyper arousal, insomnia, headaches, dizziness, flu-like symptoms, auras, crying outbursts, detachment. This really gets in the way of life. Yeah I wouldn't have started on this drug if I had known about the horrible withdrawal process.

Overall, it hasn't been a bad experience. Tried anafranil, luvox and now pristiq. The first 2 meds didn't really do a whole bunch for me. Based on my recent gene test, me and my pdoc decided on pristiq for the OCD. I was only on it 4 days before I knew something was really wrong. I have been off it 2 days now, and I still am having horrible nightmares where it feels like I'm being suffocated. And I keep getting these random bursts of dizziness. It's like you know instinctively that you are not ""right"". It's a horrible feeling. I can't wait for this drug to get out of my system and this will probably be the last SNRI I will take as long as I am alive after trying 1 or 2 others in the past.

It certainly worked for treating anxiety as I never had a panic attack whilst on the drug. I am however in the process of stopping it due to the side effects. The main side effect that I am no longer wanting to put up with is always feeling hot. It is not pleasant. I have also put on 7 kg of weight over the 2 years but can’t be sure that this is linked to the drug. I will try a different medication as they all effect people differently.,Kitten

The side effects are more annoying than dangerous ( I would get really bad night sweats for the first 3 months), but it's a pain in the ass if you forget to take a dose even once because you'll get brain zaps from withdrawal because you fully metabolize it within +/- 22 hours. I'm giving it a 9/10 because the brain zaps are really annoying but other than that I honestly believe it saved my life. For a lot of the people who can't tolerate this drug, it's largely due to metabolism and genetics, so don't be too disappointed if it fails.

There several medications I've tried and worked only to lead to weight gain. My doctor told me about Pristiq and figured I'd give it a try. I found that this medication works really well the only big down fall is the side effect of missing a dose and trying to come off of it.The severe dizzy light headlines is unreal. Almost fills like you have a bad hangover. I started taking something else while trying to get off of Pristiq, it has been a huge challenge. I'm so tired of feeling like garbage, so I do not recommend this medication for anything. Not only did have this bad side effect but I've had a problem with my jaw as well. For the last three months or so my jaw has been so tense that I can barely open my mouth to eat anything. When my dentist learned what I was on she told me this is a side effect of this medication as well. I've even gained over 30lbs while taking this. Please beware before you take this",dee

The most prominent being stiffness in back and jaw, yawning, dry mouth, strange depth perception issues with vision, feeling jittery/shakey, heavy chest/anxious feeling, and what I will call vaginal ""numbness"". Most of these symptoms subsided after the first three weeks, thank god because the heavy chest feeling was not pleasant at all! Others come and go, ie. Dry mouth, jaw stiffness, and vaginal  ""numbness"". I occasionally feel very happy and excited and other times quite robotic.

However, I wouldn't have been able to initially manage the day to day responsibility and stresses without Pristiq as well. Rated a 7 because it's side effects are severe at the beginning (wide eyes, hyper alert, increased anxiety). As well, you need to be very very consistent to take it at the same time every day/or as it is prescribed for you.  I really do not enjoy the side effects, it not as they effect my vision,  concentration,  out of world like feeling, and it can be visually obvious to other ppl which just increases my anxiety.

The results showed that I don't effectively metabolize most antidepressants. A psychiatrist said that my only solid option was Pristiq. It was much better than the other ones. It didn't effect my sleep, or cause daytime sleepiness, or make me feel emotionally numb like the other meds but it was harder to orgasm. The cost is $55-60 for 30 tablets of 50mg (BC, Canada). Fair Pharmacare doesn't cover it, so my student healthcare did not cover the cost either. I've been relying on my mother's healthcare plan.

Don’t skip a Day otherwise you’ll probably develop brain zaps until you take the tablet. If you want to wean off you have to do it slowly so you don’t experience withdrawals. I recently started taking it again due to PND (post natal depression) and as it usually takes about 6 weeks before it kicks in I’m extremely calm which is probably the best thing for me. I also have chronic fatigue and b12 and iron deficiency and taking pristiq in 200mg makes me not want to sleep all day. I’ve been on it for about 4 months now and I’m slowly feeling better. When I was on the same meds at 14 at 200mg it put me in remission for about 6 months but I made the mistake of weaning off it.

137,Pristiq,Depression,9.0,,"January 8, 2019",49,"I am 19 years old, and I was prescribed pristiq for depression about 2 months ago, and I have certainly noticed positive improvements. The first few days on it were very interesting - I couldn't sleep, didn't want to eat, but at the same time I had a lot of energy and felt pretty good. This phase went away after about 3-4 days, and everything was back to normal. After about 2 weeks, I wanted to get out and do things everyday, which was positive, but the depression was still there for the most part.  Over the next 4 weeks, I SLOWLY noticed the depression disappearing, and now I find it is  alot easier to brush off negative thoughts that depression brings. Just remember, this drug takes along time to work. Stay patient with it. My Doc also told me that EACH SSRI/SNRI has about a 66% success rate. So, if pristiq doesnt work for you, try another SSRI and it will have a 66% hit rate. Therefore after trying 3 or 4 different SSRI's, the chances are very high of one of those working for you.",doova23

Your depression will subside - though there is a BUT with that. The not great: 1. It is really hard to get off of, brain zaps, no step down options. 2.

I have tried several times over the past 20 years to stop SSRI or SNRI including Effexor and Pristiq but have experienced such horrible withdrawal symptoms that I have not been able to stop taking them. So basically I have been dependant on these drugs for 20 years, not because I really need them, but because my brain reacts violently due to withdrawal. This time I’m reducing the dose extremely slowly and it has been better than previous attempts, although I’m finding the past few weeks very, very difficult because I’m down to a quarter of a tablet every two days. I’ve been reducing the dose about 12mg-25mg at a time and staying on that dose for one month. This is the most horrible and difficult thing I have ever experienced in my life and my heart goes out to all of you who are suffering and fighting to survive this hell. I ‘m also astounded, disappointed and angry at all of the doctors and Psychiatrists who are so dismissive of this real condition and who have ignored my fears about the withdrawal syndrome and then labelled me as a ‘chronic depressive’.

One of the side effects of Pristiq is according to the warning sheet my pharmacist gave me was hyper-wakefulness.  Needless to say I had a paradoxical effect I have spent a month falling a sleep during the day.  Later sleeping eight to ten hours at night.  Due to the most awful pharmaceutical hangovers I needed to get up at 6 am in order to be in a fit state to drive by 7.30.

Every night has been disturbed by the most frightful nightmares. Night sweats and terror on waking from the most vivid of horrors.

While I was only on Pristiq for five weeks it was five weeks I’m not about to forget any day soon.   When the treatment is worse than the illness it is time to stop; take stock and in my case back away.

Negatives: Nausea, upset stomach. Very vivid and sometimes very frightening dreams. A lot of tossing and turning.

You have to give Pristiq time - it didn't start working for me for an entire month but when it did I finally knew what normal felt like. No symptoms other then happyness. Sleep is great. Sex is great. Life is great. I cant ask for more.  However I did stop taking it for 5 days with the withdrawals of irritability. So I quickly restarted. I hope this works long term for me.,Anonymous

The venlafaxine formulation in Effexor and Pristiq work in entirely different ways than the medicine you used to take. If you cut cold from your old drug, you will also have withdrawal symptoms despite having started on a new antidepressant. If you are coming off something you've been taking longer than 5 months, ask your doctor to ween you off with smaller and smaller doses first. Lexapro, Zoloft, Celexa and Prozac are SSRI's.

Nothing has ever worked like this (besides Effexor XR, but that made me much more manic) for treating my depression/anxiety. It's even helped my eating disorder. I hope it continues to be this wonderful, and I won't have to keep upping my dose to get the same effects. My only side effect so far has been a mild daily headache and crazy night sweats.

Almost immediately I saw an improvement. Before taking Pristiq I would fly into a rage almost daily. In the last 4 months since taking it I have maybe raged 5 times. I don't feel so self-conscious anymore. I feel more alive and upbeat. And to top it off I've lost weight since the drug decreases appetite. My wonder drug.,Anonymous

It finally started working and I felt less depressed but lately I am very moody and irritable. Sometimes all I want to do is stay in bed and at other times I'm up all night (like now - it's 3:55am).

I am so much calmer now and feel I can handle problems better that come my way. I have a slight decrease in appetite but at times I am actually hungrier. My gynaecologist said it would also help my hot flashes and it definitely has. The hardest thing about taking Pristiq is giving up my daily glass of wine.

When I came home I went right back on it and have had no problems since. I have no appetite and have lost about 15 - 20 pounds. It makes me feel much more awake.

I feel somewhat calmer and my husband agrees. I have lost 4 pounds so far and that is great. I have hypothyroidism and gained 10lbs from Synthroid. I am taking Pristiq because I have mood swings and horrible PMS. I do hope I feel more of the effects of this medication in the next few weeks.

I have bipolar 2 disorder, and most of the time, taking an anti-depressant alone without a mood stabilizer always set off severe mania. That has not been the case with Pristiq. Not only do I feel a million times better in every way, this drug has really decreased my appetite and I have definitely lost at least 10- 15 pounds since I started taking it about 7 weeks ago. I also take a little bit of Xanax to better manage my anxiety. However, that only enhances the already great results that I have experienced with Pristiq.",cdolen
