I suffer GAD, depression & panic attacks more so now than ever. This medication was one of my tools to help me feel me again. I have been on it for 10 weeks and I’m now getting off of it because I feel it’s best for me. Only side effects nausea and headaches. Before I wouldn’t be able to step foot in a grocery store, public but now I can with out panicking or having anxiety. It doesn’t take it all away but it’s something that will help.",Rocky122
1,Effexor,Depression,1.0,,"February 27, 2022",0,"I stopped taking this after a week because of extreme negative effects. Super nervous tension. Muscles constantly tensing and I could not relax. Pacing around the room. Yammering and stuttering when I spoke. Inability to get a night's sleep. Chest pain/ tightness. Racing heart.

It made me feel emotionally numb. Nothing made me cry. It's been 7 years since I took it, and I still haven't cried. I used to cry all the time. I'm sad at times. Just no crying. Also, scary movies didn't scare me. At all. I also had some mild brain zaps when I quit taking this. Not bad.",Dragon lady

5,Effexor,Depression,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 9, 2021",42,"I'm glad to read these positive reviews because I've been on generic venlafaxine 150mg per day for 8 years. I was on 7 different antidepressants prior to that a year or two each time then the poop out and in to a different one. Venlafaxine has not stopped working. I'm on the highest dose per day slowly increased over a year. My most frustrating side effect is insomnia and some tinnitus. I will also say when my pharmacy changes the pharmaceutical brand of venlafaxine, I have a noticeable couple of days discomfort until I adjust. People understandably tend to be angry about failure or side effect but nothing is worse to me than being disabled by depression.",Kate

8,Effexor,Depression,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 24, 2021",4,"so I started taking this drug about 2 weeks ago and have severe depression and anxiety with extreme self esteem issues, and I have been experiencing a lot of different emotions right now. I have a lot of down and depressing moments when I’m alone, to the point where I get panicked about how I’m going to react to certain situations, as I feel like I’m going to over react to the point of snapping at people, especially my family and friends supporting me right now. I have also been having tremors in my legs and my breathing can get out of control at times. Everyone taking new medication will always react differently, and it can take time to settle in but I can honestly say if these symptoms persist, I will be going off this medication. I really hope it starts to kick in a few more weeks time.",medaj

I have had bi polar depression, extreme depression, cptsd and a lot of anxiety for as long as I can remember. With in a few weeks (I had to start low dose and gradually increase do to bad reactions to most bi polar drugs). So when I got to about 175 mg I started to have no suicidal thoughts AT ALL!! I am so happy to have those thoughts out of my head. I still have some issues but this drug gave me my life back - with no side effects except extreme fatigue until I got used to it. Now I have no tiredness at all. HOWEVER HUGE DISCLAIMER. DO NOT STOP TAKING THIS DRUG EVEN FOR A DAY!!!!! You must wean off this. I actually thought  it was the end of me when I couldn't get my meds for 2 days. I vomited the entire time like couldn't stop. Extreme sweating, hallucinations not severe but still scary. Nightmares and the most painful headache that would not stop. The vomiting was the worst. I wasn't able to hold anything down and I mean extreme cramping of the stomach area.

I felt so horrible and disgusted with myself that I actually felt the strong urge to do it! Fortunately I'm very happy that I  succeeded in not doing that terrible thing. I wish complete physical and emotional healing to all those who unfortunately are struggling with such a nightmare. But I did have to hurt myself in other, less violent ways such as hitting. This drug was so so scary that it messed with my mind! This is not who I am! I was acting crazy! And my thoughts and feelings were crazy too crazy and dangerous.  Be very careful! And make sure you are seeing a doctor who really takes the time to listen to you, and wants to help you. They should answer all your questions and have no problem explaining how the drug works and what side effects there might be Also I was only on it for 3 weeks and the withdrawal effects were awful.",Shelly

12,Effexor,Depression,10.0,,"December 31, 2020",121,"I'm on Effexore for Depression, Anxiety, ADHD.1-4 WeeksThe medication the first few weeks is going to make you excessively sleepy. It is just the nature of the beast. During the first few weeks ensure that you are taking the time to get a work out in a few times a week and supplement any lethargy with a bit of caffeine. Weeks 5-8This is where the medication really starts to shine. If you are a male, this drug is ideal for you because it has a less likely chance of causing erectile dysfunction as it is a SRNI and not a SSRI. Your reaction to negative events, to include stressful situations, begins to dramatically change. Instead of having fast paced thoughts, you have a true sense of peace, less worry and a newfound sense of over all well-being. I highly recommend this medication if your SSRI is causing you ED, you suffer from anxiety, ADHD, OCD, or depression.",rjbz1

I stopped 3 months ago and already depression is returning, so today I'm going back on! Yes the side effects can be grim but for me it was only when being late with dose or quitting.

15,Effexor,Depression,1.0,,"February 24, 2020",81,WORST 48hrs of my entire life. First day I took it Effexor (dose 37.5mg) with my 300mg of Wellbutrin and I got to work and couldn’t even walk in a straight line. Went home and figured maybe I just shocked my system and slept it off.  Next day I took the same dosage.First came the spaced out phase where I couldn’t remember where I was or what I was doing. The tremors? So violent that I couldn’t walk or talk or hold things. My husband came home to find me in the fetal position on the floor shaking violently. Let’s not forget hearing and seeing things that weren’t there. Another thing I noticed was that one second I was laughing then the next crying. It was so scary and I couldn’t stop it from happening. Stopped taking it. It’s been 2 days now and I still have tremors. Can’t eat. And the only thing that will stop the tremors is 1mg of Ativan. This drugs ruined my life in 48hrs. I will never recommend it to anyone. Worst 2 days of my life and it’s still going.,Kimeska

Still have depressed days though.As for the anxiety... still there, and hasn't improved much. Panic attacks aren't as frequent or intense. But still get them.My anxiety is so bad it's to the point I can barely leave the house unless I really have to.If you're on this drug, you're going to want to stay on it and make sure you don't skip doses. I get major withdrawal symptoms like extreme dizziness, headaches. Make sure you ween off it.Overall, still depressed and definitely still anxious. The effects of relief are mild and sometimes hard to notice. I still rate it a 7 because if it has helped anything it's the panic attacks which are easily the worst mental experience you can go through aside from being tortured to death. It's very tormentuous.But because Effexor hasn't relieved much else, I'd consider trying something new.",Drugs
17,Effexor,Depression,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 14, 2020",34,"I was diagnosed with depression and GAD about 5 years ago and started Effexor. It worked well but anytime I drank alcohol I become a monster. I became violent and angry. I also lost the ability to sleep so I had to go on another medication for insomnia. Over time I realized I had become numb. I couldn't cry, feel any emotions and I lost the ability to enjoy anything. My panic attacks became debilitating. I became fearful to leave the house, drive etc. I ended up in the hospital and I was immediately taken off Effexor because i was diagnosed with panic disorder and it was not helping at all. I was at the highest dose and eventually came off. I'm still experiencing brain zaps from tapering off but since coming off I can feel again and cry a lot LOL.

First off, relax. Taking any new drug for the first time can be scary because your body's adjusting, but freaking out about any little symptom will only make your experience worse. Now on to my experience: The first couple weeks I experienced nausea and maybe a bit of sleeplessness? But nothing too crazy. Lost a bit of weight too as it suppressed my appetite. I really do believe this drug helped calm my nervous system enough so that I was able to function normally again, and so far after the first month I don't experience side effects at all. Don't be scared about all the wacky reviews, people can psych themselves out when influenced by others opinions.",Alex

20,Effexor,Depression,1.0,,"September 20, 2019",37,I was on apparently the lowest dose of 37.5mg for anxiety and I had the worst experience of my life. I had severe gut pains everyday and felt hypoglycaemic all the time. I thought my liver was going to give out it hurt so much. I was not myself. I was more anxious and depressed on the meds than I was off them. I couldn’t take it anymore and took myself off. Quitting cold turkey probably wasn't the best idea but make sure you go to your doctor to get tapered off properly first to avoid major withdrawal symptoms. I do not recommend this medication it’s not worth the risk.,Anonymous

My depression was my own worse enemy as when I needed to be sharp and confident for attorneys, I was a sobbing mess. My anxiety was  debilitating and turned into panic attacks. While I don't think I would have taken my life, I certainly wasn't afraid to die.The crisis is finally behind me, and I have tapered from 225mg to 37.5mg over the last 3 months.The only downsides were, for me, cognitive function, apathy, and poor memory. I was unable to orgasm on the 225 mg dosage.It is important to mention that I did not get through this with drugs alone.

23,Effexor,Depression,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 3, 2019",85,"I would just like to point out that every single person is different and adjusts to these medications differently. I had 3 suicide attempts before accepting medication and was put on Effexor. Effexor changed my life, until it didn’t. For 2 years it helped me to function normally, I went back to work, the suicidal ideation ceased and I was able to manage my depression. After a long time though I felt numb and wanted to get off of it. No one ever warns you about coming off Effexor. There is a whole group on Facebook just for coming off it. The withdrawals are worse than any drug I know. I counted every day. It was 12 days of agony before I felt any sort of relief. It was pure, utter awfulness. But I look back and think of what Effexor did for me when I first started this medication, and it gave me my life back.

My doctor tried several medications to address my depression and anxiety and Effexor proved to be the most effective. I started on 25mgs and went to 50mgs, which basically did nothing. It was when it was increased to 75mgs that I really noticed a difference. The trouble was that my motivation and energy levels dropped incredibly. I really struggled with foggy brain and forgetting everything. Also, rapid weight gain. I gained 6 kilos in less than a month and continued to gain over the next several months a total of 9 kilos. I was careful with what I ate and when I ate, but I still gained. We are switching the meds currently and the detox it brutal. I have been tapering for over a month and I am on day 3 of being completely off of it and I am still experiencing horrible withdrawal symptoms. The electric-like surges are painful and scary.

48,Effexor,Depression,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 8, 2018",19,"I really want to mention that this drug is intended to be started at its lowest dosage, 37.5mg once a day for a minimum of 2 weeks. Do not break in half or chew it if it is the  extended release. You can open it and sprinkle it on food.  Posts herein show patients have been placed on higher doses to start. That may be the reason why it's not worked for some. The body needs time to acclimate. Dosages increase by 37.5mg after 2-3 weeks to a therapeutic range which is 150mg. For some, effects have taken place at lower doses therefore that would YOUR therapeutic range. I'm on 37.5mg once a day for 2 weeks with minimal side effects.  Will continue to increase the dosage by 37.5mg once a day until I reach my therapeutic range.Effexor is NOT recommended for teenagers and below b/c the side effects are quite severe, maybe b/c of the developing brain.

95,Effexor,Depression,2.0,,"December 15, 2016",14,"This medication was interestingly paradoxical for me. While it was rather effective in treating the ailments as it was advertised to, it failed in another, very important area. Withdrawal from the medication needs to be undertaken over a period of several weeks gradually weaning the patient off the medication and supplementing with short term additional medications. While the medication is effective I would personally recommend drugs that affect GABA (i.e. Xanax, Clonazepam, Valium) to help the patient when stopping medication and also to keep in reserve in case of a shortage or stoppage of the medication. Please be careful with this drug. There are other drugs, and isomers, that are safe and effective as well.",Silent Harambe

Finally a friend took me to a doctor. The first drug she prescribed was Effexxor. I was prescribed the 75mg capsules. I found it to be too much for me, so I take one every other day. The only side effects I feel are from withdrawals if I skip a few days, and 'ditziness' if you will. Other than that, managing my depression has changed my life. My weight has even dropped because I used to self medicate with food. I do recommend taking only the lowest dose possible for your symptoms.

My experience is, all these tablets do is switch off showing how you feel, as in no more bouts of crying due being overwhelmed by inability to fulfill a days work, meet a deadline, etc. Since I have spoken again to my doctor regarding sleeplessness, he added Zispin 15mg to my existing medication, that was 4 weeks ago.
