1,Paroxetine,Depression,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 17, 2022",0,"For me, paroxetine has been a great medication.  I take it for a combination of depression and anxiety with some associated social anxiety disorder.  Along with the anxiety disorder I have trouble with insomnia.  I love that paxil treats all of these things in one package.  I have been on it for more than 20 years.  I have occasionally tried to transition to other meds for the occasional flare up of depressive symptoms, but I always come back to this one.   It has improved my life immensely.",cups
2,Paroxetine,Depression,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 4, 2022",2,"I I have suffered from depression/anxiety/fatigue from as far back as I can remember.. I was very good at managing it but started to notice that as I was getting older it was getting harder for me to manage. I have tried many different antidepressants over the years and either they didn’t work for me or the side effects were just too much to bear! Now over 40 years old, I figured I had exhausted all avenues, why keep trying. I reluctantly tried one last time and fortunately for me it was Paroxetine. It has changed my life. I’ve been taking it for about 6 months now and think I might need therapy to get over the guilt I have for feeling so darn happy!! I’m not advocating for Paroxetine itself. I believe medications effect everyone differently and you need to find what works for you.. What I am an advocate of is not giving up! There is nothing more important than your own personal health and happiness. Darkness is the absence of light. Paroxetine has given me my light back!",haplesschapess

I was diagnosed with cPTSD last year and currently undergoing EMDR therapy along with my usual talk therapy.I'm in discussions with the clinical psychologist that I see to see whether I need to come off this medication or try another one. Ideally I would like to be medication free and feel there is no benefit to having a medication in my system when it is not giving me any relief. If the psychologist suggests another medication then I would try one.Main side effects that I have observed since starting paroxetine are weight gain, insomnia and dulling of my personality.",Charlotte

I was on escitalaporam first but it didn’t work so I tried paxil and the side effects at first were shitty. I felt nauseous but after a few weeks that went away and now I've been on it for almost a year and it has made me so much more stable. I have motivation again and I’m doing so well in my courses. I’m not as moody anymore, I’m able to have conversations with people on nights out and I’m overall just so much happier and feel like life is worth living.

I always forgot to take it daily. I noticed when I felt like rubbish and thought oh I didn’t take my Paxil today. I didn’t want to be dependent on that drug anymore. I shaved a bit off each day. The withdrawal was AWFUL!!!! The worst part was the pins and needle feelings on my skin. I almost went back to it to stop the feeling. I knew it was out of my body because I suddenly got my sex drive back! It was GONE for 15 years!!!! I’m now on Wellbutrin and I feel amazing! I have feelings again. I can laugh and cry. PAXIL took my humanity. My pharmacist told me she was so happy to see me not picking up the Paxil every month. She said it’s the worst drug. I’m giving it a 3 rating because maybe it kept me from killing myself or staying in bed all day. Getting off of it took forever but I feel so much better! Don’t start this drug.

I finally tried a daytime antidepressant for actual depression and it was paxil. After 3 days I felt sooooo much better. Even tho I wasn't sleeping better. My mood was elevated and I just saw the positive in life. I forgot how that felt. Sadly, I stopped the meds due to sexual side effects. I couldn't get an erection or orgasm even if I masturbated.

After two months and a half I can say it did not helped me, I was experiencing lack of motivation and energy, always postponing things, all I wanted to do was to stay in bed. I had to force myself to do things, even simple things as replying a message. So as it produced me a negative effect on my everyday life I decided to stop taking it.

WITHDRAWAL AND GETTING OFF PAROXITNE (PAXIL).***The way to avoid this horrendous withdrawal, asking your doctor, is to slowly lower the dose AND AT THE SAME TIME STARTING FLUOXETINE (PROZAC) at a low dose (this process is called 'titration'), then when you have stopped using Paroxetine altogether, come of the fluoxetine (prozac) and you can avoid the vast majority of withdrawals from Paroxetine. Also works with any other antidepressant.***For example. If you use 40mg of Paroxetine, drop to 30mg while starting 10mg/20mg of Fluoxetine.This works, if you don't know, because Paroxetine (Paxil) has a *SHORT HALF-LIFE* [MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS]of *1-2 days*. This means the rate (speed, time) at which it the drug leaves your body.

It worked a treat and I even managed to travel and work overseas shortly after for several years. I got off ok by slowly weaning myself off overtime without issues. 15 years later due to 6 months of chronic pain and then taking benzos for insomnia, depression kicked in. I went back to paroxetine which enabled me to  wean myself off Benzos over a month and sorted my depression by week 3. First 2 weeks are rough, it increased anxiety (although maybe benzo withdrawal related - hard to tell) gave me distressing OCD thoughts, worsened dark thoughts and also worsened insomnia (most people should take in the morning). Week 3 was better and week 4 back to almost normal and along with CBT helped insomnia despite decreasing benzo dosage (which was in hindsight probably early signs of depression). I'm a lot more balanced and proactive now. Thoughts of suicide and OCD gone. Anxiety is mild.",Bob54

157,Paroxetine,Depression,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 17, 2015",305,"Paxil (paroxetine):I have always felt like something was wrong for as long as I can remember.  I think my depression is just normal to me and I've probably been depressed for many years without even knowing, just a feeling that something isn't right.   A failed relationship a while back, heightened my realisation that something is wrong and the pain of losing someone close was like a final straw for me.  I guess it might be true that everyone comes into your life for a reason, even if it is only meant to be for a short time.  After countless months and days googling and doing tests online, trying to figure out what might be wrong with me, I finally got the courage to go see my doctor.  After a few visits, he prescribed me Paxil and thinks this might help get me on the right track.  You see my depression isn't the usual in that I try to go about my daily life as normal as I can, it's called walking or smiling depression.  Behind it all though, I'm crippled with self doubt, negative thoughts, anxiety and constant feeling of sadness.  I feel guilty a lot, distance myself from my family and friends regularly and sometimes feel so down I cry for what seems like no reason at all.  I put on brave face to people and go about daily life as best I can, but behind the mask I am suffering.  I never really felt like I fit in and it's like I have to try to act to be happy in every day situations.  It's hard to describe, but it's almost like I'm standing behind my shadow.  I always look at other people and wonder what it's like to be just happy. I could never bring myself to telling anyone how I really felt, I guess it's only the last year or so that I became more aware and really accepting that something isn't right.  It's been so long that I have felt this way, I really don't know what normal is anymore.  I have lost 2 girlfriends  largely due to my low self esteem and low confidence finally taking its toll on the relationship, it's like I just expected them to leave, who would want to stay with a loser like me is how I portrayed myself to them.. That's probably the hardest pill to swallow through all this.  I know if I was mentally stronger, I could have held on to something good.I know I have it in me to go change my life around.  Everybody sees it in me, but I feel trapped in my own body and mind.  I have a lot of trouble concentrating and I seem to always be so indecisive about what action to take.I guess I'm wondering what I can expect from taking Paxil.  I know I'm the only one who can physically make changes, but can I expect to regain some self confidence and motivation, energy etc? I really don't know what to expect from this drug and am apprehensive about what it can actually do for me.  I guess part of me just wants to try do everything by myself, but I really don't want to waste another second of my life.
