5,Niacin,Depression,10.0,,"December 14, 2020",57,"I had slightly elevated cholesterol but didn't want to take statins. My PCP recommended 1200mg of niacin (yes the nasty full-flush kind, the flush does lessen with time). For years I have suffered from depression, antidepressants made me feel worse. By the second day of taking niacin that dark, heavy cloud on my brain just went away. My cat did something goofy and I actually laughed, I can't remember the last time I honestly laughed! It's been two months, the flush effect is minimal. I don't know yet if it's doing anything for my cholesterol but I will keep taking the niacin because I love feeling alive.",Trish
6,Niacin,Depression,1.0,,"November 29, 2020",9,"So I took 250mg Niacin tonight before bed and OH MY GOSH YICKS!!! I woke up roughly an hour since taking it and my whole body felt like it was burning and I had a major panic attack as a result. Such a nightmare. Almost went to the emergency room thinking it was an allergic reaction. Will probably try the no flush type. Anyone else trying this just letting you know if you suffer from severe anxiety like me take with caution an understand the side effects so it doesn’t take you by surprise like it did me. Still lying here trying to calm myself down. P. S. Will update after trying the no flush type, cause I NEVER want to go through that again!!!",Dogsdill

My depression was gone as well. And for some reason I felt like smiling. It was a weird feeling. The day before I had took a just about above average dose of niacin and I think that is what made the difference. Everything else in that day and previous were the same as my days with depression and anxiety. So I figured it had to be my diet since I recently changed it, to track my micronutrient intake. I feel great and like I always wanted to feel, the person above said it best. I feel like I am not the way I felt almost my whole life, I can talk to people now without feeling anxious and feel in a Way better positive mood.

Boost of energy, positivity, and optimism! However only lasted for like 4 days. Hypomania? I’ve tried up to 1500mg a day for a few days, and that feeling never came back, some low mood and anxiety only. I then read that flush niacin would be more effective. So I bought niacin 100mg. Took like 500mg to flush, and it gave me a sense of calmness and prevention of lower moods. Same thing, only lasted for a few days.

My anxiety and depression symptoms have improved greatly. I feel so much more calm and I am sleeping better. I was doing some research and this is likely related to a genetic trait which affects the metabolism of tryptophan. My flushing symptoms were pretty intense at first but have improved. It's totally worth it. I have read that the slow release niacin is no good and can cause liver damage.

Last August, after 9 years on Effexor, I stopped taking it because of the side effects.  I tried using supplements as recommended by  Julia Ross in her book The Mood Cure, but they were not effective for me.  My depression became so severe last Oct. that I had to go back on to an anti-depressant (Bupropion) but this medication made my depression much worse.  I was then put onto Trintellix in April.  The Trintellix was helpful, but side effects soon began to appear.  I happened upon an article about a psychiatrist who had used niacin for treating depression.   When I googled niacin and depression, I came upon many other blogs and comments from other people who also found niacin to be effective against their struggles with depression.  I was desperate to find an alternative to taking anti-depressants, so 4 weeks ago, I began supplementing with niacin plus vitamin C.   (I had already been taking a vitamin B multi, magnesium, fish oil and Vit. D).  I started with 100mcg niacin and have been gradually increasing the dose by 25mcg increments each day.  I use only the regular niacin, not the timed release nor the non-flushing type.Since I started taking the additional niacin & vitamin C,  I find that my depression is/has diminished significantly.  I am no longer suffering from that bottomless well of depressive  feelings that had been with me since last fall.  I stopped taking the Trintellix  3 weeks ago and my depression has continued to lift.",jemmunro
51,Niacin,Depression,9.0,,"February 16, 2015",187,Niacin has greatly improved my life. My depressive thoughts disappeared right from the start (500mg a day now for 2 weeks. Now going up to 1000mg a day). My girlfriend has also been taking it and we've both been in a greater mood (she's also depressive). Suicidal thoughts are rare now. I no longer flush.,mia9_28
52,Niacin,Depression,8.0,,"March 13, 2012",212,"I have suffered from severe anxiety and depression since 2002 when I had cancer and did chemo.  The chemotherapy I did saved my life but it messed up my hormones so much that I went into premenopause at the age of 17.  I have been on various doses of Effexor XR for the last 8 years ranging from 75-300mg a day.  I needed medication to live a normal life.  In the last year or two, I had been progressively getting worse until I felt like I was spiraling out of control.  I had been working with my doctor to find a solution but nothing was working.  Extra meds were not helping.Desperate, I tried niacin.  500mg a day.  Flushing is worth it.  I am now off Effexor, and on niacin instead and it works better with less side effects, only the flush.","Still crazy, but under control!"

54,Niacin,Depression,9.0,,"November 9, 2009",238,"I recently watched the movie Food Matters and learned that Niacin can be used to treat depression and alcoholism in addition to high cholesterol. I began taking last week, and have noticed a gradual improvement in my mood as I increase the dosage. Make sure you start low and increase gradually, though: the first time I took it I took 100mg with a light snack and ended up stripping down and standing in my kitchen panting, but there were no lasting negative effects.",Blushed
