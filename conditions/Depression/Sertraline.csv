I am taking 75mg a night combined with present awareness, walking, positive thinking, offering positivity to everyone everywhere I go, and healthy eating.

4,Sertraline,Depression,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 25, 2022",0,Hi all don't normally ask for advice but hoping someone can help me. My doctor as prescribed me 50mg sertraline last week there still sitting in the cupboard cause I'm too scared to start them. I'm not good with tablets tbh they make me panic. Even taking antibiotic give me anxiety also I've read all the bad reviews. Don't know if I should just start to take them as I scared of the bad reviews and scared of the side affects. Anyone have any advice ? Thankyou,Nikki

Sometimes I would cry uncontrollably all day. I began 25 mg of Zoloft a little over 3 weeks ago. I am one of the rare people that noticed a change within the first few days, and it has been great the whole time so far. I feel like myself again, and have not had an emotional spiral since beginning this antidepressant. Anxiety is also much less. I anticipate my doctor will up my dose in a few more weeks, and I will probably stay on this SSRI for a while until my brain can do its job on its own. I am so glad I gave this a try. I felt so lost and alone, and thought I was going crazy. I just needed a little help.",Pam
7,Sertraline,Depression,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 21, 2022",2,"Firstly, I would like to say overall my experience with sertraline is good. I started taking sertraline about three months ago and at first it was helping out very much, but somewhere around the last week of the first month it felt less helpful, but still helped..Then around the first week of my second month taking sertraline, I forgot to take my medication daily and constantly. So in retrospect, had I kept taking said medication I would probably felt better about it. I also declined to up the dosage on it because I wanted to see if it would help still at a lower dosage. I think I may have to up the dosage.",25 yo Man

After that, it has lost its potency, and have since then been in permanent state of depression, unable to go back to full time work, and unable to come off the med (due to severe withdraw effects), in spite of multiple attempts, with multiple tapering methods over the years. In addition, I have also been dealing with daily side effects like morning fatigue, emotional blunting and lower libido. There is no doubt, the med has done for harm than good and I have paid a huge price for that temporary relief the first 6 months.",Angelos

Milpharm have also taken over a gastro tablet called Omeprazole from Almus which I'd take 2 tablets in the morning and id be fine all day but since Milpharm has taken over they don't work at all .I can only assume Milpharm has been on a cost cutting exercise but their actions have made their medication worse not better.",DirtyBarry.

The week after I started shaking constantly, my speech was so fast and my legs would move all night.I still stick with it. This was 25mg too.I started feeling a bit lighter but the anxiety just came out the blue. I had a lot of nervous energy. I upped to 50mg after 6 weeks. I  started scratching my skin in night unintentionally, it would bleed and is wake up surprisingly jump up scared. I still kept going. I was thinking about death a lot.

13,Sertraline,Depression,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 2, 2021",1,"I was on this medication for close to a year before I stopped taking it. When I started, the main side effects were trouble sleeping and slight nausea. The nausea went away after two or three days, but the insomnia stayed - which was unfortunate because I was suffering from an inability to fall asleep in the first place. After around 1.5 months, I started to feel the antidepressant effect of the medication to kick in. I remember walking down a road when suddenly, the sky, the sound of the birds flying above me just seemed brighter - I will never forget this feeling, and it was such a relief after suffering from major depression for quite a long time beforehand. Sertraline definitely won't ""cure"" your depression, but it can do amazing things in helping you get through a tough time. Still, I believe that seeking other forms of help, such as therapy, is key. I eventually discontinued this antidepressant because of the insomnia, increased anxiety and the sexual dysfunction it caused.",Carol

15,Sertraline,Depression,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 28, 2021",6,"it helped !! >> now hear me out. I was so so sceptical because when I started sertraline I felt absolutely insane. I had these horrible suicidal panic attacks every day and felt so dissociative as if my life wasn't real. I felt completely numb to every emotion, even my girlfriend, being honest, I felt like that for a good two months and then slowly started to improve over my third month and now its finally sorted me out. I feel completely functional and have access to all of my emotions and at peace :) obviously my life still has its ups and downs, no pill is going to be a miracle otherwise everyone would be on it. But I promise you please please please be patient. It is worth hanging on. It will work, just give it time to balance out. You are putting chemicals in your brain and your body is just taking time to adjust. I know its painful I know its hard and I know you are anxious about it.

16,Sertraline,Depression,8.0,,"November 28, 2021",1,"Zoloft (sertraline):For depression and anxiety. 50mg a day. Have been taking for almost 6 months.Overall it has helped. My moderate anxiety has definitely lessened. My depression (which I would also describe as moderate pre-Zoloft) is milder now. It took about 4 months for the side effect of occasional weird thinking to wear off, but I was drinking alcohol on zoloft for most of that time period. I haven't been drinking for the past month. The big knock on Zoloft for me (and the only reason it doesn't get a 10) is the libido side effects. It has become difficult to ejaculate, and when I do, it doesn't feel as good as it used to. Viagra helps with erection and ability to ejaculate quite a bit, but it's still not the same as pre-Zoloft. It's a trade off I guess. I have also put on quite a bit of weight, and faster than I ever have in my life. I think there's a correlation to zoloft but can't be sure.",judonerd
17,Sertraline,Depression,9.0,,"November 25, 2021",18,"Zoloft (sertraline):Been on it 3 months at 50mg every morning. It hasn't been extreme,  the side effects just never hit me thankfully. Of course the first day was a bit of nausea. Overall it is helping. The effects are fairly mild.  which is what I was looking for. My depression is average and not severe.  Please don't give up on yourself because with mental illness we tend to make things worse than they really are. I was also an opiate addict and if you're an addict don't expect to feel high from zoloft. At first I was craving a high from this drug, I wanted to feel so happy 24/7 but that's just ridiculous because you still need to put in the work to get this medication to work well enough that your depression subsides. You can't just pop zoloft and expect to feel happy. You have to get the ball rolling with positive thoughts and a better lifestyle. You can't take your zoloft and fall into the same pattern of laying in bed all day. You need to force effort.",George

Can't say that the drug was effective during the period that I was drinking though I give the medication some credit with helping my mood and anxiety in early sobriety. Problem was that two years into sobriety it seemed the medication stopped working for depression. So I moved on to another antidepressant.,Rathmullan

I was very, very unwell almost bedridden with extreme anxiety, depression, racing thoughts, panic attacks etc. I gradually got a little better but it never fully went away.

I sleep better, I have more energy during the day. I do housework, talk and spend time with my children again, I’m proactive and looking forward to the future. I haven’t felt like this in years. Anyone who’s considering it please give it a go. Everybody is different. It may not be the drug for you but it may also be the perfect drug for you. You just never know.

Suddenly, after over two months of pure nausea and vomiting due to my anxiety and depression whenever I tried to eat or think about food, I look forward to my meals again. I have seen a HUGE reduction in my intrusive suicidal thoughts. My anxiety levels have gone from an 8 to a 4. Today they were pretty much at a 2/3. I wake up and I don’t dread the day. I can think about beginning to process my emotions again. I feel hopeful about the future. This is my second time using Zoloft and this time I can see a much more noticeable effect for some reason (I think my depression was worse this time around). I stigmatised myself SO much for having to back on the SSRIs after going through the whole weaning-off process only months before, but oh my god am I glad I got over that stupid idea.

I remember things and get things done with energy where as before I would sit or forget things.    Not sure the loose stools are worth it as I'm always hungry.

I’ve tested five other antidepressants that had little to no effect on me. For some reason, Zoloft works wonders.

I started out with 25mg, and am now taking 100mg daily. So far it has worked quite well for me. I can remember how depression ruined everything I enjoyed in life. Every day felt like I was trying to move with a ball and chain wrapped around my ankles. It was hard for me to start getting medicated (because of personal reasons), but once I did, I could see that Sertraline began to help in little ways. I wouldn’t cry so much. I was able to pick up some of my hobbies again to a certain degree. And other than having low libido and tiredness, I had no nasty side effects. My only problem would be that my social anxiety didn’t seem to improve as much as I’d hoped. Nonetheless, I was happy enough with the results I did get.Overall I wouldn’t say it’s a miracle drug, but it definitely made my life easier to live.

I stopped taking the meds at the start of the week, now on day 3 I have cleaned my house and planning to go for a run later, something I simply would not have contemplated last week - only 3 days I know, but I feel like I have found myself again - I won't be taking any more, they just dampened my emotions when things were really bad, but now I would rather feel something than nothing at all......",Buckby girl

I could go to the grocery store ! I was able to clean my kitchen ! Without needing a nap ! I still wasn’t quite there after a few weeks , (need to be more functioning) so increased to 150mg .

The anxiety/OCD/rage was worse than the depression though. I've been on Sertraline (100mg) for a collective 4 years and its pretty much done the same thing: It ELIMINATES anxiety, OCD and rage/anger issues. It's better than benzos in doing it as well. The problem is what is doesn't do: For me, it had no effect on the depression/mood (which was the point?). Side effects: Fatigue (like a zombie), yawning, feeling disconnected, and makes you have terrible quality sleep.If you're a male, it makes it difficult to ejaculate.In closing, I would use this for major anxiety/OCD/PTSD/anger issues, but it doesn't lift your mood.

Side effects of nausea/increased anxiety can be horrible but isn’t 24/7. Propanolol 10mgs and diazepam 2mgs helped.  Up to 150mg and again happy days bad days. Nearly gave up again.

This uplift grew and as a result I was able to study, see friends, and look after myself in ways that were not previously possible. However, I had a lot of dark thoughts and still felt depressed. What troubled me the most was not being able to sleep well. I know all are affected differently but I would advise to be particularly wary of this drug if you have insomnia, and to make sure that you are supporting your body alongside SSRIs if possible (e.g. osteopathy, acupuncture), as the pills won’t get rid of bodily tension caused by stress.

I thought diets, sleep etc could help me. They would only at first.I gave Lexapro a try, my first medication ever. It helped some and I wanted to settle with Lexapro because at least my depression was at bayTwo years ago I started Zoloft and it literally saved my life, marriage, memories with my kids, saved me from me. I truly didn’t know what normal life was like until I started Zoloft. It hasn’t changed me, it helped me be the true, happy me that would show up periodically. All those organic ways might help some people. Just don’t think big pharma can’t help you, like I did before I tried meds. I never ever ever thought I would be saying that.

Zoloft basically made me chatty, happier, and gave me the inability to cry or feel sad even when I was supposed to be very sad. The inability to feel sad seems pretty good to me.

My depression was severe and depression as well as anxiety runs in my family. I know some people don't like medication and some people with less severe depression or anxiety might be able to do without it. Everyone is different. I have learned that depression is a disorder for some though because the mood chemicals like seratonin and dopamine just don't work accurately in the brain for some of us without medication. It can be similar to anemia where the body struggles  with lack of iron for the blood. If you need medication to get through don't feel bad because you can't control the chemicals in your own brain. I just worry about the possibilities of the system building a tolerance. Hopefully that wont happen though as it didn't with another medication I have taken for sixteen years for epilepsy.,Jay

I had nausea that did eventually go away but what stuck around was extreme fatigue (on 100mg I was unable to stay conscious for more than 2/3 hours at a time), teeth grinding, loss of genital sensation and anorgasmia, tremors, blurry vision, and a constant 'checked out' feeling. It did slightly curb the suicidality but the sides made me even less functional than I was before- horrible drug for me.",berry

After research I found out that this is possible at the start so it’s really important to know it’s the drug not you, once you get through the first 2-4 weeks it will get better. It’s so important to reach out to people, talk about how you feel and meet with family and friends. Try to get out as much as possible, I know it’s the last thing you want to do when feeling depressed and anxious but it helps because social relationships are what really helps, hold your loved ones close.

I was very apprehensive about taking anti depressants so I’d tried exercise, healthy eating, yoga etc, but always ended back up with the same feelings. I’ve persisted with this medication and have found it to be brilliant. The first 2-3 weeks were terrible. Brain zaps, headaches, nausea, zoning out.

It’s not a miracle pill, else everyone would take it, but it’s certainly helping alleviate tiredness, interest in my usual activities and a lot more clear outlook on life.

A lot of reviews after taking one day, couple weeks etc. you need a full three months for maximum effectiveness. Not that it takes that long to start getting relief. Side effects are common while your body adjusts. Some of them will go away. I had no troublesome side effects with Zoloft. I always have to start out gradually. Maybe even more than they say bc I’m sensitive to meds. I got big relief from depression. Panic attacks went away. OCD went away. The cons are it made me not very motivated, felt kind of numb to strong feelings. Not feeling urgency about my life.  I wouldn’t take it again for years bc it blocked my clear perspective. But it was great to get me stabilized. Things  that really help but can’t completely replace anti dep is fish oil, vit d, exercise, sunlight, folate like spinach , lentils really good. Also diet really helps. Get a book called the good mood diet.  Best wishes",Louann

Of all of these meds, I've found zoloft works the best for me.  However the worst thing I experience with zoloft is decreased libido, as with all of the other meds I've tried, except for wellbutrin.  This side effect truly sucks. Zoloft also kind of makes me feel robotic and emotionally numb. Currently I'm experimenting with another medication (viibryd) in attempt to find a med that works without having sexual side effects. However zoloft is my fallback option, because this med at least stabilizes me and helps function in society.  Therefore I give this med a 7 out of 10.

Two months ago my mother, father, and brother passed away in the same month unexpectedly. It about sent me over the edge and I felt a need to go back on anti depressant, as I have been off of them for several years. I started taking sertraline two months ago and I feel so much better. No euphoria, just smoothes out the jagged edges in your life, makes you feel more in control and reduces anxiety. I will say at first that I felt it made me feel worse. It took about 2 1/2 weeks before I felt better. So, stick with it and give it a chance.",Brian in Houston

I was previously on another anti depression medication of little benefit. My side effects at the beginning were terrible. I felt sickly and dizzy but it is definitely worth persisting. Truth be told this medication saved my life! But took a while to work so bear with it and struggle through. I have now been on it 5 months and whilst it's not a quick fix it did reduce the frequency and severity of suicide ideation. It doesn't fix everything just makes me feel like I can cope better and makes me a little more rational. However I still have some bad days and still struggle with motivation. I was at the point of not looking after myself, couldn't get out of bed, refusing to eat or take medication. I dare say I was on my way to end up getting committed.

I started out at 25mg for a week and then 50mg and 100mg and 150mg and then 200mg over a 6 month period and have been there for 5 weeks. I think the medication helps, but you have to do more to really get back to normal. The drug helps keep more serotonin in your brain from what’s already in your body. You have to do more to really increase the serotonin levels in your body and your brain. Exercising helps for sure, but I finally figured out that caffeine and alcohol weren’t helping and had to mostly eliminate consumption of those. I read where they actually deplete your serotonin. Recently the drug really helped change my thought process, which was really warped by the anxiety/depression. It’s amazing how they can really alter your perception of reality. Just started taking GABA as well because you can be deficient in that also, which causes anxiety. Also omega 3. You can try tryptophan and 5-htp too.",JC

It takes slightly longer to orgasm, but this has been good too as my orgasms have been more powerful!

One of the side effects seems to be enhanced anxiety levels. I also became increasingly depressed and struggled communicating at times. I had disturbed sleep patterns and constantly racing negative thoughts. It was tough. I had read up on the subject though and understood that this was only temporary and battled through it. There were times that I nearly gave up. Times when it all seemed too much. Slowly, but surely, things started to improve. The first two weeks were hell, the third week became hellish and the fourth less so. After 6 weeks my smile had returned, I was able to tackle the world and confidence began to flow.

Then I would scream and carry on like a maniac for a few minutes. Then I would cry in helplessness and shame for a few minutes.  Finally, I talked to my internist, and she suggested Zoloft.

I cry much less now and don't lie in bed at night thinking about suicide as much anymore.

Let me start off by saying that this drug, literally, saved my LIFE. I've always battled anxiety and panic attacks, and was on a small dose of Paxil and that seemed to take the edge off. I took it on and off for years. After I had my second baby at 28, I got terrible postpartum depression. I had thoughts of suicide, racing thought constantly, couldn't nap and took forever to fall asleep at night. I literally spent three months just thinking and obsessing over how horrible I felt. I wanted to crawl out of my skin and die. I was barely showering, brushing my teeth and hair and would stay in the same sweatpants and shirt for days. I could go on forever by I'll get to the point. After three months of pure hell, I went to my doctor for help. I was prescribed 50 ML of Zoloft. After being on it for 4 weeks, I stopped taking it because it wasn't working. After going another 2 weeks feeling miserable, I went to my doctor again.  She recommended we up the dose and stay on it for atleast 6 weeks. Well, after two weeks on 100 ML, I realized I was feeling better. I would go minutes without thinking negatively, then I would go hours, then full days. It feels SO good to feel like myself again. I truly thought I would be miserable forever. Please get help and try something if you are feeling terrible. Everyone is curable with the right drug and right dose. I wish I got help sooner. TRY THIS! It will work! If for some reason it doesn't, try something else! GET HELP NOW! I was doing the same thing you are - googling all types of antidepressants convinced there was no cure and they would never work. Stop spending your life wondering when you will be yourself again.
