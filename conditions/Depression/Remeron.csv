0,Remeron,Depression,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 25, 2022",5,"Remeron helped me sleep right away and I took 15mg for 6 months.  I decided to lower it to 7.5mg because I suspected it was causing high blood pressure. I put on 20 pounds while taking this medication, but I also take lithium and losartan and they can also cause weight gain.  I was on 7.5mg for 4 months, and still slept well and had no major side effects. Then I noticed my sex drive was less and I could not reach orgasm. When I complained about that to my psychiatrist she offered a switch to trazadone. I decided not to switch, but rather to end my use on anti depressants.  I feel the lithium I take is enough to keep me from being manic and losing sleep.  I tapered to 3.75mg for 5 days and then quit. I felt tired and had a dull headache for that week.  Then, 7 days after stopping all the Remeron, I had an awful night.  I sweat, I was nauseas, and I felt unwell. The strangest symptom of withdrawal was/is the vibrating in my ear drums. It s already easing up after a couple days.",lisa
1,Remeron,Depression,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 13, 2022",3,"Dangerous drug caused me spasms, heart racing,no sleep and it’s near impossible to come off.

2,Remeron,Depression,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 11, 2022",1,"I’ve been on Remeron for over a decade. It’s helped with sleep for a long time but now I have to take melatonin with it to sleep. I developed panic disorder unrelated to Remeron and now I feel it’s too weak of a medication to help prevent panic attacks 100%. Besides that Remeron is super safe, helped me gain weight and gives me bursts of excitement when looking forward to things which is an odd but cool effect. Being I’ve been on it for so long it’s safe to say this drug is safe long term. I’m afraid to ever come off of it due to horror storied of coming off medication for long term.",Antoinette
3,Remeron,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 28, 2021",0,"I will NEVER take this again.  I've never gained weight like this in my entire life except when I had my ovaries out and they couldn't get my hormones right.   I gained 15 pounds in just over a month, and my normal weight is 110 pounds, so that's a very high percentage increase.  All I wanted to do was eat.  I woke up hungry and even after I ate, I was hungry.  This stuff should be BANNED. Do NOT TAKE IT, unless you're severely underweight and need to gain.  It will take me months to get the weight back off after just over a month on.",Anonymous
4,Remeron,Depression,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 25, 2021",1,"This medication gave me the most painful experience of my entire life. I am a 40 year old Caucasian male, 6 ft 1 /180 lbs, and I was prescribed this and instructed to take one before bedtime. I took it with my usual single Benadryl and melotonin. About an hour later, as I became drowsy, my joints started to buzz so I went to bed. The buzzing turned to vicious burning and spread up my bones and then to my muscles becoming so unbearable I was soon writhing and screaming. This was punctuated with waves of convulsions that had my body contorting unnaturally. I called a nurse on call who said those were not listed as side effects and suggested remedies that proved useless (ibuprofen, shower/bath, hydration). Between convulsions I paced the house, the coolness of outside gave little relief and my body was engulfed in such fire. It slowly improved over 24 hours and I was given a benzo to sleep.",David Junto

It affected my self confidence greatly and I felt depressed.Remeron for me was a god send . My nausea went away, my appetite increased greatly and I gained 20 lbs which really boosted my self esteem.

8,Remeron,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 11, 2021",7,"I've struggled with anxiety for years, but once I started college it got to be unbearable. I started having physical symptoms like dizzy spells, chest pain, and severe memory loss. Last semester my anxiety caused me to get stomach cramps so severe that I would pass out and literally poop straight blood. I was undiagnosed for anxiety at the time, so my doctors ran countless gastro tests on me, only for them all to come back negative. I got so bad that I couldn't keep anything down besides oatmeal and my weight plummeted. No one could figure out what was wrong with me until I switched primary care doctors. My new doctor took one look at me and had me put on Remeron for anxiety. I honestly wasn't expecting much, but this medication did wonders for me. My stomach cramps stopped completely and I started getting the best sleep of my life. I gained a small amount of weight back (which was needed), but I didn't experience any crazy weight gain or appetite increases.",10/10
9,Remeron,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 29, 2021",5,"This medication really did wonders with me! The first days I felt even worse emotionally, I was miserable, crying and hopeless and I even considered stopping. I have gastroparesis too, and Remeron is used to treat GI symptoms so I decided to give it some time. After the first week I was a complete different person in a great way. I’m no longer depressed or hopeless. Things that used to put me down can’t do it anymore. I’m calm, happy and motivated everyday. It has helped me a lot with my gastroparesis and I’ve being able to eat more.",happydays1
10,Remeron,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 20, 2021",94,"I was on 7.5 for a few months after deaths in the family. Remeron works WELL. No side effects except it being hard to wake up, hence coffee. EXCERCISE & LIMIT CARBS while on it.  Many people say it’s impossible to come off Remeron. It’s Not. Yes it’s not easy, but it’s doable. If you do a slow, gradual taper over several weeks or months, depending on your specific situation, you will be off no problem. I’ve been off for about a week now, and I tapered over 2 months more or less, to the point of taking micro doses (a tiny crumb of a pill) in the final days. Make sure to have the natural calming agents: Fish oil, Magnesium Glycinate, Ashwaghanda, CBD oil, Melatonin, GABA, Chamomile tea, &Vitamin C. Have a good healthy diet with organic foods, exercise daily, and meditate before going to bed. The people that struggle coming off came off too fast, or tried cold turkey.  If you have bad insomnia and need temporary (weeks/months) help sleeping, this is a VERY GOOD drug.",Al B.
11,Remeron,Depression,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 27, 2021",27,"I’ve struggled with severe nausea induced by anxiety for years. I went to countless doctors thinking it was a GI issue, but they couldn’t find anything. I finally went to a psychiatrist and she prescribed me Remeron. I occasionally get nauseous still, but it is bearable and doesn’t prevent me from doing every day things like it did if I take this medication on schedule. If I forget to take it one day, the nausea returns but I am able to live everyday life normally with this pill. The one thing I will say is that this pill will knock you out. I work early in the morning and have to take this pill and go to sleep around 7 pm every night, but that is doable for me and definitely worth the benefits of this medication. This medication saved me!!",M
12,Remeron,Depression,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 28, 2021",523,"TLDR: Alleviated body panic and sleeping issues. Do not take if you already have issues managing symptoms of depression.I was prescribed this for PTSD and because my sensitivity to noise disrupted my sleep. Sudden noises produced a sort of 'fight or flight' response from my body that was typically followed by an emotional response. Remeron dials down that nervous response. I haven't woken to foot steps while on it and I have become significantly less sensitive to surprises.Beware, your body will take time to get used to this medication. For the first week I was horribly lethargic. After that I had issues with anger and rage filled outbursts.Always keep in mind that drugs are just a fraction of what it takes to be mentally well. To all reading this, I love you and I'm proud of you for being here.",Me!
13,Remeron,Depression,7.0,,"March 11, 2021",6,"This helped take the edge away of my depression and anxiety, but wasn’t too relieving. The side effects are what is getting the best of me. I gained 60 lbs and I always feel fatigued, but a weird one is that I started getting this pain in my upper-slight left of my back and it was hurt in the front too, like below my pectoral. I thought it was back a strain, but after I researched it, it turns out this medication can inflame your pancreas and that’s what is causing that for me. Overall, it can definitely help, but be aware of side effects.",Jay

20,Remeron,Depression,3.0,,"September 20, 2020",23,"First off, the doctors have it nailed down what my issues is. It's residual effects from an old brain injury. Unfortunately they treat it as depression alone.Remeron made me feel fantastic, erasing almost every worry I had at 15 milligrams. Doc bumped it to 30mg, I felt almost like my old self again.I typically stay 220-225 pounds, am 6'1"", and that's how it's been since the Triassic period, except for when I dropped to 212 earlier this year. I found eight nasty surprises (pounds) when I stepped on my bathroom scale. I messaged the doc right away and told him I was dropping back to 15 mg, which he ultimately approved. My weight continued to rise over the next week, topping out at 231lb, though the urge to snack had stopped.Four days later the fun began. I became dysphoric to the point of wanting just to sleep all day but unable to even with some reasonably strong sleeping pills. I began to crave Remeron and gave in to taking it.",shadow460
21,Remeron,Depression,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 8, 2020",34,"I have bipolar disorder, and during my low episodes I experience intense anxiety, which feels all day like that feeling when you look over a huge drop (if you're scared of heights). That feeling where your heart almost jumps put of your mouth, and also with ruminating thoughts of guilt and shame (OCD-like), that are so extreme they send me into depersonalisation with hallicinations. After just 1 or 2 doses of Remeron at a dose of 15mg, during these episodes, those ruminating thoughts and anxiousness almost completely disappear. It's miraculous. They make me so numb that I feel like I could do a bungee jump and not feel anything, which at times is a life saver. However that feeling of complete numbness, paired with feeling very groggy in the mornings, is what makes me come off of it when these episodes pass. Using it in this way is what works for me, although it's an off label way of using it. With BPD, the numbness makes me split on my partner quite badly and lessens my creativity.",Starsngalaxy

24,Remeron,Depression,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 18, 2020",53,"I was feeling very depressed 3 years ago and I've always suffered from anxiety, I tried other anti-depressants but the side affects were horrendous so I started on 15mg Mirtazapine, they started to work after a few days. I felt calm and my anxiety reduced hugely, I also slept very well. They will give you very vivid dreams, after a few weeks I started feeling anxious/agitated during the day so I popped another pill and that did the trick after an hour. The Doc upped my dose then to 30mg and they worked great at night. But I felt very anxious in the morning so the Doc  very unusually apparently prescribed 15mg for the morning, that really did the trick.Fast forward 3 years, I'm still on the 45mg and they still help me sleep, my mood however is a little on the low side, anxiety is quite bad, in a nutshell they work less and less the longer you are on them, I'm now thinking of tapering off them and trying some talking therapy even if I am a little sceptical of the value of doing so.",Trytrytry

I would indeed say and agree with that the lower doses are VERY sedating. Very weirdly vivid (not nightmarish) dreams... I had a gene test done and this medication was on my ""lower doses maybe be required"" I can't even imagine what a high dose would do! This is completely staying on my 'NO!' list!

Remeron was suggested in treatment since I’ve suffered with anxiety/social anxiety/major depression for so many years that I had lost hope in ever getting better. Remeron worked fast and with counseling/meditation/exercise, and I felt like a person again. I was on Remeron for about 4 months until I tapered off my 7.5 mg dose. For me less was more. About 10 months later I noticed my depression creeping up and since I’ve been sober/clean for about 15 months I felt like I fell short in mental health maintenance  (when I really didn’t) So I went to see a doctor and got back on 15mg and the next day the medication was already working better than I could have ever hoped for.

28,Remeron,Depression,1.0,,"February 19, 2020",157,"I was taking mirtazapine for around a year and had I been in a better space I would have gotten off it as soon as I realised it was causing certain effects on me. Minor side effects - sluggishness, major weigh gain. I was prescribed this medication due to having poor sleep but it made me have vivid awful dreams - sleep paralysis multiple times a night. I used to sleep for 14+ hours, usually in the day due to being worried about falling asleep for the nightmares. It caused me to miss lots of university - I was so tired and drowsy I could not physically get up. I wish I had been able to understand the effect it was having on my body and stop them sooner. I was severely suicidal. I made plans almost daily, even walking to the shop I thought about walking in front of buses.

30,Remeron,Depression,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 31, 2020",33,If you can tolerate Remeron then it can be great. It did wonders for IBS/sleep however it did make me get irritated easily and helped a little for anxiety but I was not able to give it long enough to see how much it would have helped. As I raised my dosage I had side effects that the doctor said would not go away if I continued so I had to stop it. I can also tell you that doctors seem to think this a drug that is easy to get off of but after 6 weeks and being told I can quit cold turkey it was not pleasant and obvious withdrawal symptoms. It can take a week before the drug is out of your system so this can last awhile. I would only recommend this as a last resort.,will

33,Remeron,Depression,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 6, 2019",54,"I have been on 15mg Remeron for almost a year & it has been a blessing. I suffer from chronic PTSD, Depression, Anxiety, & Insomnia. My anxiety was probably least affected by the medication, but it could be due to my dose. But my depression is almost entirely gone, if it does appear the duration is typically shorter & it’s overall less intense. I get a great nights sleep almost every night which is so important for health. My frequency of night terrors has been reduced to one per season, I don’t feel as dissociated, & when I get sleep paralysis (follows my night terrors) the duration is more like 1-2 minutes vs 30 minutes, which is just about how long it used to last. So far, Remeron is doing more than I could ask for regarding my mental health. Overall I’ve felt so much better & my brain doesn’t feel off or hazy or confused. I would recommend bringing it up to your doctor if you suffer from several mental health disorders like mine because it works well for that combination.",RHamms

My insomnia has basically disappeared and I sleep like clockwork 2 hours after taking 30 mg. I can't describe just how grateful I am it's not just changed my mood but also my whole frame of reference and outlook, it's something akin to changing the colour of a lens on a camera, where once everything looked dark now everything looks bright.

I had anxiety and depression and I had tried zoloft, buspar, wellbutrin, and am on lexapro still. Some of my worst anxiety symptoms were nausea, lack of appetite ,and vivid dreams. I am currently on lexapro 15 mg with 7.5 mg remeron that I started a little over a week ago. I was scared to try it because I am sensitive to medication changes but the first night I slept amazing, fell asleep easy and woke up with a quiet mind. I still had vivid dreams but I did not have an anxiety producing reaction. I was scared I would never find an answer to my anxiety disorder which resulted in depression as well. Highly recommended if dealing with insomnia, vivid dreams, and lack of appetite. I did not have any weight gain but did have food cravings for the first day or so but other than that this drug was side effect free.

45,Remeron,Depression,7.0,,"May 8, 2019",34,So I’ve been taking mirtazapine a while after being hospitalized for anxiety and depression and it helps knock me out to sleep good and stop waking up in the middle of the night. It makes you sleep a lot and  it’s hard for me to want to get up to go to classes. It makes me feel really tired throughout the day but it does help with anxiety and depression. I’m overweight and I’m kinda scared it will make me gain even more. It makes me more hungry all the time.,Anonymous
46,Remeron,Depression,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 30, 2019",64,Started taking Remeron 3 months ago. I have severe anxiety and insomnia which in turn caused depression. I became dependent on Ativan after being hospitalized. I took the Remeron while weaning off the Ativan. I never thought my body would recover. I suffered through the withdrawals and while wanting for the Remeron to kick in. It helped me sleep starting the first night. Ever since I’ve been sleeping average of 9 hours a night which I desperately needed. For my anxiety and depression it was a gradual effect and took almost two months to work. I’m glad I stuck with it. Don’t get discouraged when starting this med. It takes time to work. I’m happy to say I’m no longer dependent on Ativan. I only take as needed which is rare. Remeron has helped me wean off the Ativan as well as being able to function daily without constantly being on the edge.,Tiem

Finally, this medication helped me to recover from depressive attacks, I got divorced which gave me depression. I took the 7.5 my before bed it reduced my depressive feelings by 80%, it worked quickly within a couple of days .

It also completely stopped my full blown panic attacks - I have only ever experienced a much milder, limited symptom panic attack since having been put on it.Unfortunately, there is considerable weight gain and voracious appetite. I wasn't warned about this, so I went up 2-3 sizes within 2 months without realizing what was going on. I haven't been able to keep the weight off while on Remeron despite low cal diets etc. Keep an eye on your portions and calorie intake when starting this.

151,Remeron,Depression,6.0,,"October 25, 2009",23,"I have been taking Remeron for a month now for depression, anxiety, loss of appetite and insomnia.  I have experienced a red swelling burning sensation in my face and neck - almost like a sunburn, painful, lasting at least two days then still feeling a little sensitive in my face and neck. My sleep is better, however there are still nights when it takes me a couple of hours to fall asleep, other times I go out like a light.  My appetite is better and I am not as anxious  anymore.  I have tried many other anti-depressants and Remeron(30mg) is the best for me by far.  I only hope that the face problem goes away.  I did read a comment here by someone who was experiencing facial edema.  In the monograph it does allude to this.",rafflesmom

153,Remeron,Depression,10.0,,"September 12, 2009",185,"This antidepressant has been a blessing in my life. I was 25 lbs underweight due to depression, and also had speratic sleeping. The side effects are a benefit for me. It makes you hungry, especially after you take it at night. Crave lots of carbs, and have been eating like I have never before. I have gained 11 lbs in just 1 month on Remeron. It also has a nice sedation effect to help with sleep. When I take my 30mg dose at night, I have everything ready because after 45 minutes I can barely keep my eyes open, and then get a great night sleep. Side effects are worse during the first week, and then everything balanced out! If you suffer from sleep and or eating, then Remeron could be the biggest blessing in your life also. It gave me hope.",K_Todd777

155,Remeron,Depression,4.0,,"July 29, 2009",85,"Taking this medicine in conjunction with Lamictal. Doctor gave it to me because I wasn't eating/had no desire to eat for a week and I wasn't sleeping at all, and also for depression.This drug gives me crazy hunger cravings I have been on it for about  2 1/2 weeks now. When I first started it I was eating everything. Butter toast is still my favorite. I notice I crave salty and sweet foods. I am sleeping all of the time and I am on 15MG at bedtime. I have to drink coffee so I can get up and function if I have nothing particularly important I sleep until 3 or 4 o'clock. So it definitely has helped with the insomnia and the not eating, but it makes me feel high.",la morenita
156,Remeron,Depression,,,"April 28, 2009",46,This medicine makes me sleep too much. It's great for insomnia but I do not need ten hours of sleep a night. That just makes me more depressed. Then I have some body zaps and I have another medical condition that it affects. I may stop taking it. I think it has increased my appetite just a bit. I ate five pieces of toast one night and four the next morning.,ShanLM
157,Remeron,Depression,8.0,,"April 10, 2009",30,"I have been on this drug for around 6 months for depression. Aside from the side effect facial odema (after 2 weeks so mild you wouldn't know it's there) this drug has been perfect for me. It has improved my mood a lot.To begin with I was able to sleep perfectly. Taken with quetiapine (400mg) I was getting over 8 hours a night for the first month or two. However now that effect has gone and I'm needing benzodiazepines to get any sleep at all.The weight gain has been a blessing too. Before mirtazapine I lost 14kg in a month. I'm now nearly back to my previous weight, though again the quetiapine may have something to do with it. While 4 months into it I lost my appetite again, I'm still eating and that's the most important part.",Anonymous
158,Remeron,Depression,10.0,,"March 17, 2009",148,"Although I can't take tricyclics, I can take Remeron. I have treatment resistant depression and this is the only anti-depressant I can tolerate (I have been on every type of anti-depressant except Wellbutrin). I don't know why it works so well on me, but it saved my life. My weight had gotten down to 112lbs (I'm 5'7) and I looked like a corpse. I've been on it for a good 8 years or so and it still helps me sleep. The hunger side effect subsided for the most part...a good thing because I gained too much weight back at first, then leveled out at 130lbs. Some of my family have tried it and it knocks them out for the night and next day. Also, they've complained of a ""hangover feeling"" after they wake up. Many doctors told me it's a good medicine.",kaylynn1019
159,Remeron,Depression,6.0,,"March 9, 2009",30,I have been on medication for a couple of years on and off. I don't really think I get the full effect of it because I miss doses due to me working midnight shifts and this drug makes you very sleepy and hungry.,dreamgyrl

It gives me a huge appetite right before I go to sleep, but I can avoid it with some self-control. It also made me dizzy during the first week or two, but that has also  disappeared. I have energy, focus and humor again. It's an effective antidpressant.",Anonymous
