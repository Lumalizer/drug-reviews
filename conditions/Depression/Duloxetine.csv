0,Duloxetine,Depression,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 28, 2022",0,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):I've been on Cymbalta 60mg for the past 3 weeks. Before that I was on 30mg for a month. I started to feel a difference at 2 weeks on 30mgs but the side effects really wore me out. They still wear me out. When I started on 60mg some of the side effects levelled out. But the ones that have been unwavering everyday are the night sweats and the insomnia. I toss and turn in bed all night. Finally fall asleep to wake back up drenched in sweat. I may sleep 7 hours but I never wake up feeling well rested. I've also noticed I am more sensitive to the cold. I can't stand it and have an overwhelming urge to take a warm bath that I end up sitting in for hours until the water cools. Overall I feel it has helped my depression, it doesn't make you happy but happiness is a concept but Cymbalta balances you out so getting out of bed or eating isn't so hard. I would also highlight the fact that Cymbalta doesn't decrease my sex drive. If I can't get the insomnia under control tho I doubt I will continue on it",Rayna

I took the lowest dose only 1x a day and it made me super lethargic unfortunately. I had to quit after 3 weeks because I needed to function at work. I quit cold turkey with no side effects.

Stopped working after 10 days, so kept increasing dose with no positive effect.  Withdrawals - do not underestimate - took 4 months to get off, pure nightmare.  Gained a *huge* amount of weight in a few months, and I never had a weight issue in my life. When I read reviews claiming weight gain, I assumed it was their fault for eating more/exercising less - WRONG!), changed my body odor to stinky, gave me cystic acne (at 40!), profuse sweating, always too hot or too cold, eating salt as sudden drops in blood sodium, dangerous increase of BP (which was low my whole life), then cause extreme fluid retention in my legs and abdomen, couldn't breathe, looked heavily pregnant, was hospitalized.  100% Chemical castration, no desire, sensation, ability.

4,Duloxetine,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 3, 2022",0,"My initial experience with Duloxetine was a positive one. I didn't have any increased fatigue, it dropped my 2-3 week long PMMD symptoms to 1 week only. It really helped with the rage a LOT, extreme night sweats/hot flashes, and was very effective for the joint pain I have caused by the disorder. The bad outweighed the good shortly thereafter. I experienced insomnia, horrible restless leg episodes to the point I had to put on Mirapex just to sleep at all, then my skin erupted into an incredibly painful and itchy rash (about a month into taking it and this was now about 6 months into taking it) that was literally ALL OVER my body (scalp, neck, arms, legs, back, butt). I saw a dermatologist, who said it was Eczema and she did not seem to think it was caused by the duloxetine, but even after treatment the ""eczema"" would not go away. My internal medicine Dr. advised that I STOP taking this medication immediately. I am now about 10 days out, SLOWLY healing and will NEVER take an SNRI again,",SweetMelisa32

6,Duloxetine,Depression,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 13, 2022",0,"I was on duloxetine for nearly 6 months for my anxiety and depression. This is strange but I was having obsessive thoughts about my girlfriend everyday to the point I got super exhausted, very anxious and depressed. I was put on 30mg to start off with and the first month maybe 2 I didn’t notice much of a change. Eventually I found myself being able to leave the house and see friends but was still having these thoughts all the time. Went back to my doctor and he upped my dosage to 60mg which is the maximum. After a couple of weeks I felt more like myself but still had these obsessive thoughts. Went and saw another doctor and she took me off doluxetine as apparently if I didn’t notice any changes within the first 1month/2 being on it, then It wasn’t right for me. Now I have begun taking Prozac/fluoxetine so hopefully I see some results in the next few week. Some side effects I experienced were jaw clenching, insomnia and mild headaches.

I have to say I have never had a problem with eczema in my life and all of sudden I develop severe eczema in patches literally all over my body within a month or so of taking this medication. It only got worse after the dose was upped from 30 mg to 60 mg. It is maddening. I am taking myself off this drug. I'm scared to but this is painful and I can't handle it. It's heart breaking because my PMDD is so severely debilitating and for the first time in a long time I got to live normally for a little while... praying that I don't go into full blown Cymbalta withdrawals. I have been on this drug for 4 months now. Trying to come off citalopram was horrifying. I am praying so hard this is easier.,Anonymous

Everything was okay, I had a pretty normal withdrawal from Lexapro for about 3 days. The doctor slowly upped my prescription of Cymbalta to 90 mg, and I ended up in the ER 5 days into that dosage. I thought for sure I was having a stroke. I couldn't remember words, I was weak and completely dazed with an almost high feeling. 6 days later I'm still feeling dazed, and I barely get anything done due to a lack of concentration and weakness. This drug was a total disaster for me. My Dr. warned me that there are withdrawal symptoms when lowering doses, even after only taking Cymbalta for just a month.

I had two major things occur. The first one was I slept almost CONSTANTLY. I would sleep for 6 hours, wake up for 1 hour, go back to sleep for another 6 hours and repeat the cycle almost daily. The second, and more concerning, was I had a major increase in suicidal thoughts. However, for me, the worst part about Cymbalta is trying to come off it. This goes for many medications but Cymbalta has severe withdrawal symptoms. I had dizziness, nausea (and vomiting), irritability, headache, sweating, shaking, diarrhea, tingling of the skin, the whole nine yards.

And to add that with any drugs, and especially psychiatric, people will have different reactions. I had TERRIBLE results with Zoloft, Paxil, Prozac… and those are some of the most used SSRI. I need an SNRI, so Cymbalta has made me able to live comfortably again. (Along with other meds) My Effexor had stopped working after 10 years and I switched right over. I didn’t have one issue; I did it very slowly. On other meds I have had extreme side effects so I know it can be scary. This is a great med for those who respond.

I'm currently on 30mg duloxetine and will probably increase to 60mg. I was on 60mg five years ago for about 18 months and 10 days on current combination. No other medication or combination of medications has worked anything like as well. I've tried different combinations of fluoxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, agomelatine with aripiprazole, olanzapine and quetiapine. Nothing works as well as duloxetine/aripiprazole. I thought nothing would work, but this does. In fact it works too well, and when I was on it first time I took risks that were reckless because I was too happy so I decided to change. I'll have to watch for that this time around. But it feels like finally the sun has come out and there's a huge weight off my mind.

Of course these drugs work differently on different people, but I am so glad it has had a positive affect on me. I had previously tried (for extensive periods) 5 other types of anti-depressant with no success whatsoever. But with Duloxetine, it's like a switch has been flicked in my head - suddenly I enjoy things, look forward to things, and no longer have thoughts of self harm or suicide.The side affects, to begin with for me, were uncomfortable, but subsided after two weeks and I'm so glad I persisted.

I was asleep but could see my surroundings and fully mobile. The doctor said cymbalta doesn’t do that but the hallucinations stopped as soon as I stopped taking the medication.

In addition, I felt more tired than usual and I had problems with ejaculation. After about 5 months at 90 mg, I decided that the benefits are not worth it and I slowly tapered down to 0 mg within about 1 month. The worst withdrawal symptom was moderate nausea, especially when I moved abruptly. Thank goodness I didn't get any brain zaps, which I keep hearing a lot about. I am now a few days at 0 mg and I still get occasionally nauseous, but I think it's getting better. Constipation has gone away and my sleep and sexual function are also better.

The first two weeks were quite intense as the pills made me feel I had drank about 15 coffees, so I was constantly wired, but that calmed down with time. I came off of cymbalta once, for about 6 months, and it was truly awful. I can’t say if I was any worse than how I was pre-cymbalta, I think I just returned to my normal pre-medication state, but I noticed the dramatic difference and decided to take it again.

But then I started to be paranoid reading about the cymbalta withdrawals on the internet. So I panicked went off it. I always start at the lowest dose possible and stay on it a month before increasing to the next to avoid being sick. And it’s the same thing when you want to get off these meds to avoid withdrawals. You go off as slow as possible. And I want to mention that these meds are metabolized by different enzymes in our body that we all have different levels of because of our DNA. So one person might need a lower dose of cymbalta than another because they metabolize it faster than others. The goal isn’t to get to the highest dose but the dose that works with your metabolism. Ten years later and I have Fibromyalgia  too now so my new doctor decided to put me on cymbalta.

The cons to the drug,(had to wait 3 days to fill my prescription)thus if you quit cold-turkey, you could have severe brain zaps (it feels like an electrical current running through your brain and it occurs a few times per hour when the withdrawals begin). Also it didn't give me a burst of energy like Wellbutrin did, but Cymbalta made me feel more emotional towards others(rather than being numb to world)",JB82

I gained a lot of weight from eating without thinking(compulsive), and started to feel the social aniexty again. Honestly I was very hesitant about starting Cymbalta because I had read all the side effects, but I have had almost none. I drink lots of water all day long so that might have something to do with it. I got control of my appetite again.",MDGirl

However, the benefits of taking Cymbalta outweigh the negative side-effects by far.  This drug has been a life-saver for me.  It is the best anti-depressant I have been on.  I would rather sweat a little more and sleep a little less, than suffer from the debilitating effects of depression.",Anonymous

These side effects lasted for a few weeks but then I started to feel great. After 5 months decided to stop taking it - big mistake. I felt dizzy, sick, pounding heart, headaches and the depression came back almost instantly. Started taking it again 2 weeks ago.
