0,Effexor XR,Depression,6.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 23, 2022",0,"I have been on Effexor XR since I was a teenager, about 12 years. I do wholeheartedly believe that this medication saved my life at that time but I have fluctuated in dosages. Within a couple of years I was up to 150mg which worked for a long time. I eventually went up to 300mg which isn't recommended and have been trying to wean off. It will take a few months to notice an effect and the withdrawal symptoms are AWFUL. If I miss more than 1 day, I will not be able to walk. Usually it is only recommended as a 3rd or 4th option for a reason.",Anonymous
1,Effexor XR,Depression,4.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 17, 2022",0,"I really resent being put on Effexor XR as a child without my parents being told that it was addictive. Sure, I was bipolar (type 2) and needed an antidepressant, but the psychiatrist should’ve put me on something that wouldn’t give me withdrawals when I miss even one dose.I ran out of Effexor one December while waiting for it in the mail. For a week, I was having horrible symptoms- chills, rapidly fluctuating moods, vivid nightmares, crying spells, nausea, and so much more.I want to be able to get off of the Effexor, but after taking it for 20 years, I think it’s too late.",Snowy
2,Effexor XR,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2022",2,I’ve only been on this for one week but what a difference! I usually wake up depressed and have low energy. About an hour after I take it I have energy and feel so much better! So far so good. It’s the lowest dose so no side effects to speak of. I’ve tried every antidepressant out there and none have helped or had bad side effects. I’m almost afraid it’s too good to be true. Fingers crossed that this will keep working. I’m 61 by the way. Don’t give up hope.,Sandy

4,Effexor XR,Depression,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 11, 2022",0,"I was put on Effexor in the hospital after having a complete nervous breakdown. I had never been on an anti-depressant before, it was my first. I gained 90 pounds in 6 months. I was so exhausted that I would sleep all day and all night, waking only to eat. I had no motivation at all. I was having the most bizarre and disturbing nightmares every single night. I didn't even want to go to sleep because I was so terrified of the nightmares. I started getting rashes on my arms every time I went out in the sun, like a sun allergy. I've had depression for a long time and I've had a lot of feelings like ""I just don't want to be here anymore"" but on the Effexor I was having extreme suicidal ideation, like actually planning it out and thinking about it vividly every day and night.  I stopped after 6 months because my doctor said none of those were side effects of Effexor and it was all in my head but I did a ton of research and there were a lot of others having the exact same side effects.",xfreespirit79x

You should know that severe dissociation is a (rare) possibility before taking this medication. It also made me loopy. People said I was slurring my words and thought I was drunk. It affected my memory so badly that I couldn't remember to do daily tasks like preparing food, laundry and bathing. People were always mad at me because I couldn't follow conversations. It ruined my quality of sleep. I always felt buzzed on caffeine yet exhausted at the same time. This was on 75 mg: what most doctors consider the lowest dose.",Libby

I've tried 3 SSRI's, Clomipramine, and Abilify before this drug. The drug helped improve my mood a bit, but didn't seem strong enough to help the rest of my issues. Just know before taking that this drug is difficult to taper off of; I felt sick when tapering. However, the drug has very minimal side effects and is easy to tolerate. I felt the effects within a few weeks",Anne-Marie

First started 10 mg Citalopram and had a horrible reaction which made me think I was about to go to the psych ward, caused a couple panic attacks too. Started 37.5 mg Effexor XR and now I’m at 112.5 mg. Depression improved drastically at 112.5 mg, and was a bit noticeable at 75 mg, 37.5 did nothing. GAD seems gone, mostly. My social anxiety which mostly resolves around me feeling inferior to others, over analyzing interactions with people, & a fear of making friends & going to the store. Among other stuff. I haven’t noticed my social anxiety change much, which makes me feel  a bit rubbish but it’s not debilitating per-say so it’s okay.. I guess…",Joey

This drug ""really works!"" for the first month or two, then stops working. Then your doctor has you increase your dose, same thing. Until you are stuck on it and addicted.

In this time my mental health only got worse, I didn't get me out of bed and eventually I broke down, couldn't handle it anymore and voluntarily got admitted into the psych ward at hospital.

For me, it did not, even though it was on my GeneSight Go list. I have battled depression on and off most of my life and I have always responded well to the older tricyclics which are basically SNRI’s so I figured this has got to be a newer, better SNRI version. I kept telling my psychiatrist that it was making me tired and depressed and we kept going up in dosage. Got some pretty dark thoughts on this, too. Maybe it helped a bit on anxiety. Took it for about 9 months. When it was time to come off, I literally had no withdrawal so not everyone goes through those. Dr had warned me about this med and not to miss a dose, etc, due to the short half life and then warned me again coming off. She was amazed I got off it so easily but basically said it probably just wasn’t doing anything. I’m sticking to the older tricyclics. Trial and error.",JustMe

I was told to expect feeling like a very strong cup of coffee. Ok cool. Then I started to feel my pupils dilate and they felt very strangely warm. Realized I was high as anything and the medication very similar to pain meds-they don’t take the pain away, rather get you high so you don’t care that it hurts. I could see this helping people who struggle to get out of bed or have enough energy, but that is not what I need. Felt like I had taken a tab of E and gone to the club.",Ouch

After I took it I felt it change the depression after the first does!and now after 3 months of it, its the best medication I tried till now.

I find myself often watching/reading about stirring events just to feel SOMETHING, even if it is negative. Feel extremely lazy (I thought this drug was supposed to help with motivation??) and just want to sleep all day, which is very much NOT like me at all. Has anyone else experienced this with effexor?

Effexor didn’t do much for me for about 12-16 weeks I noticed a difference . First 8 weeks I had terrible insomnia I nearly stopped it . Having looked up treatment resistant depression I decided to try taking folate and 6 weeks later it’s the first time I’m feeling 90% myself again .

It was. When I decided to stop taking it it was a nightmare. The brain zaps were unexpected and scary. I felt so sick. After my doctor at the time told me there was no withdrawal, and to just take more instead of less. I was done and decided to find a way to get it out of my system. I had to go to two more new doctors before I found one who believed me and was willing to help me get off of it. The way we did it was switching to Prozac and tapering off of that, because it has a much longer half-life.

The anxiousness went away quite quickly, however I began averaging around 13 hours of sleep a day. I persisted despite the extreme lethargy, taking this medication for 4 weeks. I feel like I wasted a month of my life on this medication, I didn’t feel hunger, however still needed food to stay awake, so didn’t enjoy eating as much but ate the same amount - if not more sugar to try and compensate for the tiredness. I was hoping for the opposite effect, so naturally I was disappointed. It completely got rid of my sex drive.

I started on 75mg as I was running out of time to make a decision.  I endured the worst side effects for 5 days and on the 6th they decided to change back to 37.5 mg. I’ve been on that for almost a month now and that’s the right dose for me. I’m happy and excited about the pregnancy and I feel like myself again. Full of energy and thinking clearly. My sleep is a little bit interrupted but it’s nothing. The best decision I could have made!",Anonymous

From the outside, I look successful, brilliant, intelligent, normal, etc. But I am sick as hell. Sick, but in treatment. I take care of me as I could and I really don't care about what people think about Venlafaxine now. I don't want to die. Believe me, noradrenaline and serotonin recapture is no garbage.

For those of you who have had a bad experience you need to have the swab test done by your Dr  (covered by insurance) to find out what drugs work for you.Has been a lifesaver for me! I was switched by smart NP after taking Paxil for many years w many problems/after I took the mouth swab test & it showed Paxil was bad fit for me. I have zero side effects aside from a little weight loss which for me is awesome as I'm 57 & fit but had those nagging extra lbs. Extra lbs gone/mood lifted/don't dwell on stupid things.  I'll be on it forever as I'm permanently low in serotonin & NEED the boost. Without it it I just lay in bed & don't want to do anything. Get the swab test done & if this shows up in the left column try it! Little adjustments with dosage is required - just start at 75mg which helps teenie bit & then go up...Its also cheap if you pay cash...GOOD LUCK!!!!!!,jlady/Cincy

I began seeing a psychiatrist and was started on effexor.  Around my 3rd month being on effexor I was increasingly paranoid and tired.  My doctor's response was to increase the dose.  I began to become very nervous, and started pacing, and having trouble sleeping. He put me on trazadone for sleep, which made me feel incredibly tired the next day.  His response to the sleepiness was to increase my dose again.  I started to have severe depression then, and became incredibly moody and volatile.  I no longer had a fuse for my anger, and became very withdrawn from everyone.  This, of course, sent me on a downward spiral, ending with me being hospitalized.",Dread&Loathing

I started on Remeron initially and titrated to 45mg/day, but did not feel it was working for my depression, although it did help with sleep and appetite. I tried gabapentin for a while and was able to quit Remeron entirely for some time (wanted to give my receptors a break). Gabapentin was great for anxiety but made me more suicidal. I quit gabapentin and went back on just 15mg of Remeron, this time also adding the Effexor. I have been very happy with the results. It seems to be the first medication that really works for me. I had significant side effects when starting Effexor, but they subsided completely after about a week- feeling high much like MDMA, and I had diarrhea and some insomnia. When I increased from 37.5 to 75 mg, the only con I noticed was lower energy level (and some yawning). I started drinking some coffee to help with that. This is a very serious medication to be taking, as I know it can be very hard to withdraw from; however, I am committed to sticking with it. Eventually may increase my dose up to 150mg. Effexor makes me feel very mellow. I am less concerned about what people think of me. I am quite confident with the ladies. My sex life has been better than ever on this med combination. I have wondered if my sense of humor is dulled, however. I am also somewhat lazy, but this may change when I go up to a higher dose. Risk-taking behaviors should be watched when increasing the dose, as I broke my ankle playing sports. Overall, I give this medication 9/10 and am very happy that I got the script. I recommend taking it with Remeron to better manage the nighttime, and to counteract the side effects. They have a wonderful synergy. My only concern is that they may eventually stop working, and I may eventually have to stop taking them and suffer the infamous withdrawals.",Roger33

I tried Wellbutrin awhile ago, and failed miserably on it due to the anxiety it brought on. Therefore, I was hesitant at first because I heard that Effexor XR affects norepinephrine as well.

After a while we had to increase the dosage to its maximum, and had to add the max 80 mg of Prozac to keep me ""normal"".  After about a year, I started having real problems with exhaustion and fatigue.  It took a lot of testing and doctors and finally two separate sleep studies to find that my deep sleep had been disrupted significantly -- essentially I was getting NO restorative sleep, even when I slept for 8-12 hours!",oxaf
