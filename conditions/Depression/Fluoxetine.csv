Biggest mistake ever, if your reading this please ask your Dr before deciding your OK  and want to try life without  medication. Since Prozac having a very long half life  about 5 to 6 days and took almost one year for my depression turned into major depression. My life was in a crisis and I couldn't stand everything and couldn't deal with life on life's terms. A shrink told me I was very depression which shocked",Male Adult Drum

2,Fluoxetine,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 8, 2022",1,"Hi everyone, I know how terrible it feels right now if you are new in this sector. I've been in Fluoxetine since 3 months now, I know that the first couple of weeks or even the first month will be hard to cope with and you might think that really you will never get better. I know how it feels when you just want to go in the ER because you do not feel good like almost all of the time and you will ask yourself why am I even using this drug. I am on 20mg I take it in the morning, I still have my ups and downs because Fluoxetine does not make you a super human being, it just makes you more of who you were before depression and anxiety. Makes you able to enjoy things in life like you used to before. Give it a little bit time to work. Remember if you think you are at 10 and if you have a bad moment you go to 8, do not be disappointed because you will never go to 0 again. Please hold on",agniezska12345

4,Fluoxetine,Depression,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 3, 2022",2,"Prozac (fluoxetine):I was prescribed this first before I started my ADHD meds. I have been on SSRIs before. I don't really respond to them, good or bad. The only positive I noted during my time on this medication was less frequent/repetitive thoughts and more indifference to things. I was only 5mg for 1 year. I couldn't take 10mg because I am sensitive to medication and even 5mg gave me the side effects I will discuss below. Insomnia: I could not sleep. I had to be prescribed sleep medication while on Prozac. I used to be able to fall asleep fine, even if I was depressed, I would rather sleep than not. I would get maybe 6 hours and then wake up with energy and I didn't like it. I always felt like my body was secretly tired if my mind would just let it be. Headaches, teeth grinding made worse, and in turn, neck pain, shoulder pain. Less appetite, no weight loss or gain. Vivid dreams, some violent in the beginning. Weird digestion. Felt on edge at times. My nose is no longer stuffy either so allergies?",JoJo
5,Fluoxetine,Depression,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 31, 2022",15,"Prozac (fluoxetine):Hello, I wanted to share my experience because when I was in the thick of my depression and reluctantly decided to try antidepressants, I was absolutely terrified and it was reading reviews on here that really helped me stick it out and have hope for a better future. Prozac/Fluoxetine has honestly changed my life. In the best way ever. I had so many symptoms that I thought were just personality traits that I can see now was actually my anxiety and depression. I used to worry so much about everything and had terrible insomnia because of it. I was completely reliant on sleep aids and was always overwhelmed with work so much that I was taking sick days very regularly. Prozac did take about 8 weeks to start working for me. So you do need to be very patient. But I feel so much better now. I don’t feel any different, just think clearer and no longer sweat the small things. If you’re struggling, please don’t be scared. It might be the best decision you make.",Coolasacucumber
6,Fluoxetine,Depression,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 30, 2022",0,"I was put on this for moderate depression as a teen (13-15yo). It bumped my mood up a little bit at the start, but all in all it wasn't very effective for me, feeling almost like a sugar pill. I kept getting worse and ended up in hospital at age 15, where they first maxed the dose to no avail and then switched me to Cymbalta, which finally helped. I'd say to other teens and parents of adolescents (or anyone else interested) that there's much worse things you or your child could try to relieve their anguish with than this pill. Its effectiveness is up to the individual though, and you will need to practise keeping up your emotional health in other ways too. A word of warning: not all doctors will check for it or remember (mine didn't), but you NEED to tell them about other medication you are taking! Due to the way this medication breaks down in the body, it can interact with other drugs and raise their levels.",tyhmyydenylistys

I had this sad song I listened to earlier in the day before taking my first dose of fluoxetine stuck inside my head all night, the worst part is that the song literally sounded horrible to me, even though I liked it before. It sounded totally awful and I didn't feel the music one bit, it just sounded like a sequence of noises put together. Then came NIGHTMARES, I had them whilst I was awake somehow (hallucinations or something) I couldn't even explain what was going on, I stopped after taking it for 2 weeks, after I stopped I became manic and felt suicidal.

I only take one 20 mg tablet every other day as that is all I need, and I will soon get that down to 1 tablet a week. It’s just enough to keep my brain in check. It does take a 2 / 4 weeks to kick in but when it does, trust me you will know. I feel like my old self again. It’s not such a big deal trust me.

I am  a 42 years old man married with kids and have struggled with depression all my life and  I've been on and off meds during different periods. During the last year I took zoloft 200mg  for several months, it helped with anxiety but made me sleep too much. My doctor switched me to prozac 40mg in the morning which I've been on for about 6 months now. I felt a bit less tired and foggy. It definitely ended my panic attacks and anxiety but I still feel sluggish and struggle to get things done in and out of the home. If you have panic attacks and anxiety with depression this could help you.

Within an hour of taking them in the morning I would get panic attacks, heart palpitations, shivering and felt like I was suffocating.These would last until 6-7 pm. Was spending my days in bed shaking until they settled. Reading the reviews of people saying their lives changed on this drug and trying to ride it out. On the 6th day. They did not settle anymore and I ended up in the A&E.Maybe it was because I was put on 20 mg right from the start.

14,Fluoxetine,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 12, 2021",7,Prozac (fluoxetine):It took a full 7 weeks to have any tangible result. In fact the first few weeks were tormented but my GP told me to carry on with it come hell or high water.  I did actually quit taking it initially but tried again through desperation. Made me feel extremely anxious and panicky in the beginning but I found the tool of mindful meditation to be an excellent antidote to panic. I didn't believe prozac would have any effect but I now find it very helpful indeed. I also got rid of the stressors in my life (poor job fit and bad relationship) and learnt how not to ruminate. I had a small amount of alcohol once after the 3 week and it made me feel very ill on Prozac so I have stopped drinking beer. I have tried other ADs before but couldn't stomach the side effects and I have to admit that I had to swallow my pride before swallowing Prozac as I used to think depression was for weaklings when in fact it is rather the opposite kind of people who suffer from it.,David N

I felt the effects after the 2nd day taking it. I do take it at night time now because it made me so tired.  I'm still tired but nothing as bad as I was.

After the first few days I noticed an increase of dizziness, fatigue, loss of appetite, a thick fog, unmotivated, nausea, headache, sweating, feeling completely numb, getting annoyed easily and quickly, and these have all gotten worse with each day. Today I had my first scary thought that was actually SCARY. To the point I got up and tried to put myself in a safe place and calm down. Out of nowhere I got very strong and vivid thoughts of suicide. I couldn’t see anything past the exact moment I was in and it felt like there needed to be an end.

It reacts very badly with alcohol and after three weeks I attempted suicide. My doctor upped the dose and I carried on for three more weeks. I took myself off alone, drank and generally felt I just didn’t want to be alive anymore. I prayed something would happen to me, a car crash or something to just end the misery.After going missing for a day my family urged me to speak with another doctor who swiftly swapped me to citalopram.

Week 6 my head became clearer, anxiety subsided and I had motivation to get up in the morning. I began to see the beauty in the world again and appreciate the smallest things.

My thinking was clearer, it was a happy feeling and the only reason I stopped taking it at that time was I couldn't sleep much many nights with all that energy!!

Decent marriage, good kids, great job-and I couldn’t understand why I couldn’t be happy and grateful. I got to the point where I had no feelings and wanted to hurt myself.Outside of reading-inspiring books and literally peeling myself from the bed in the darkest of moments, Prozac really helped me. It took weeks, very painful weeks. Once it kicked it I became interested in my life again. I’m in a good spot right now and I believe it’s because I listened to other success stories and kicked myself out of bed everyday regardless of how much I wanted to crawl under my covers.

The two major things that this drug has changed for me is that it's made me calm and collected and it makes me worry/stress less. The thoughts and problems that usually fill in my head don't affect me as much anymore and I get over things much quicker, which has led to decreasing my stress and my severe anxiety. I've also felt very calm and mellow, which could turn some people off but for me it has been a blessing. I've always not been able to stay still or focus, and am very scatterbrained, so this is a huge change that I've welcomed.

Initial day 9 crash as autoreceptors sense too much serotonin and move to regulate levels so they drop making you feel like the world is coming to an end once they desensitize things improve.

It helped get me functioning again but I wasnt happy. I still didnt enjoy the things I loved doing. For example, I would try listening to music or play video games but it wouldnt do anything for me. The euphoria was kind of missing. I know 80 mg is the max dosage but I shouldnt have to be on the max dosage or go beyond it to get a desired effect. Oh, and I lost my sex drive on Prozac too!
