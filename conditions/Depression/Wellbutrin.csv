0,Wellbutrin,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 8, 2022",1,"Started Wellbutrin XL 6 weeks ago after having depression and constant anxiety and bad side effects on SSRI’s. First 2 weeks I didn’t notice much or have any side effects. Week 3 my anxiety was the worst I ever experienced and at points I felt like I was having a heart attack. This side effect subsided after a week and left me feeling better than ever. No depression whatsoever, and my anxiety is at a normal and manageable level. I Feel normal for the first time in years, this medication saved my life. It takes time to have a full effect so be patient.",Mr. Pablo
1,Wellbutrin,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 23, 2022",2,"Coming off of paroxetine I have found bupropion to be a god send.  The sexual side effects of paroxetine became too much to handle.  I was hoping they would mitigate to some degree but they did not.  Tadalafil solved the ED problem but not the lack of interest or inability to orgasm.  I asked my doctor to put me on bupropion and he started me on 150mg daily and has now increased it to 300mg daily.  My mood and depression have been replaced with just being happy.  No anxiety.  No depression.  It's the first time I've felt normal in a very long time.  Sex?  It has returned in spades.  The desire, arousal, and ability to orgasm and ejaculate are back full force and then some.  The orgasms are incredible!  Bupropion has allowed me to treat my depression without sacrificing my sex life.",cowhow
2,Wellbutrin,Depression,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2022",4,Wellbutrin worked very well to reduce my depression.  I am more motivated to clean my apartment and I sleep less and I think about death less.  The only problem is that it works for only 12 hours.  I'm only on 100 mg.,Scott
3,Wellbutrin,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 21, 2022",8,"Wellbutrin has been a life saver for me! I have a background of depression, suicidal ideation, OCD, intrusive thoughts and anxiety. I'm 24 and I have been on it at a dose of 150mg for a few months now and my mood has improved significantly with no side effects besides mild weight loss. The intrusive thoughts have largely gone away and I actually feel hopeful for the first time in a decade. Since starting it, I've been able to get on a normal sleeping schedule for the first time in years. I have also lost about 5 pounds, though that is through a combination of efforts and variables. I was scared to try antidepressants for a LONG time, and before Wellbutrin I tried Prozac, which didn't work well for me and gave me tremors. I was a little hesitant to try another drug after that but I took the chance and it has truly improved my life in ways I can't even express. I'm so thankful for this medication.",Anonymous
4,Wellbutrin,Depression,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 16, 2022",6,"Wellbutrin was a life changer. Been taking it for 12 years now. It solved my issue of being extremely tired, sleeping wouldn't charge my batteries, lustless, dull, no motivation, & I could sleep all day. Went to 2 clinics. Tested some and nothing helped. After I tried zolpidem to sleep my short term memory went to shreds.  So I went to a 3rd clinic. after 5 mins the woman prescribed me wellbutrin and told me to come back in 2 weeks. 2 w later I came back, full with energy, shaved, had my life back. So thankful I found the right med. Please keep testing meds till you find the right one!! I was diagnosed ADD, attention deficit disorder and have some feel for depression. 2d after i stop wellbutrin I get tired, +10% every day! Side effect: brain fog if mixed with alcohol. Oh, I also quit smoking with buproprion 20 years ago. How lucky was I? Give it a chance. Use only original Extended Release. Also moved to a sunny country. Rainy days makes we sad, but I love sun!. I am happy now. Good luck!",Mike
5,Wellbutrin,Depression,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 5, 2022",2,Used it for SAD and ADHD. I gained 20lbs+ both times. This shouldn't be marketed as a weight loss aid at all. Increased my appetite. I binged uncontrollably. It did increase my focus and was very calming but it also made me more tired. Nope,MoodyandTudy
6,Wellbutrin,Depression,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 1, 2021",4,"In my opinion Wellbutrin only worsened my depression, my psychiatrist at the time (I have now got a new one) prescribed Wellbutrin for my depression as well as my ADHD not only did it worsen my symptoms but it had no effect on my ADHD. I only got bad side effects from Wellbutrin, worsened suicidal thoughts and extreme increased appetite. I would not recommend it to anyone but maybe it’s just my experience, everyone’s body acts differently",Gianni
7,Wellbutrin,Depression,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 27, 2021",18,"I am on week 3 on Bupropion 150 SR , I went off Paroxetine cold turkey and started this. First week I was tired all the time and had some weird nightmares that went off starting 2nd week.  Then  the 2nd week I felt  awkward  I was not me ,  I was very irritable, didn't want to be around people, had some headaches that week and wasn't interested in doing  many things, I was about to quit but my doctor told me to please give it a try until week three when it is supposed to start working (from week 3 to 6 ) so I did with a lot of effort and I am so HAPPY I DID HANG IN THERE !! I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER today is my day 22 and I at last feel peace, joy and motivation again to do things I didn't  wanted to do before. I am eating less not so hungry, stopped smoking and do not need caffeine to function as I did before. It doesn't have side effects on libido like paroxetine, so far It has been worth to wait 3 weeks of not feeling so well IT IS WORTH IT PLEASE HANG THERE !!!  Pray for all to feel happy..",Faithful
8,Wellbutrin,Depression,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 26, 2021",8,"For years I have had struggles with PMDD. The first half of my cycle, I am fairly regulated and happy. For the second half of my cycle, I will have depression, suicidal and racing thoughts, complete loss of motivation, and getting angry at those I love most. Over the years I have tried two other antidepressants that had terrible side effects. My doctor encouraged me to finally try one more option as I also lost my daughter a year ago. I have been on Wellbutrin for only a little over a week now, and so far it has been life changing. I have had no side effects other than mild constipation, and I still feel like myself (I did not on the other two medications I have tried). Right now, I am in the part of my cycle where I usually experience the worst of my depression and mood changes, and I have literally had none of my usual problems. And although I still feel sadness about the loss of my daughter, it feels manageable, and I no longer feel like I want to die too.",Sarah
9,Wellbutrin,Depression,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 22, 2021",4,I started having a bit of mild depression. So I started looking for what I could do to fix it I started taking some medication that made me feel like a zombie so I started doing my own research and found that Wellbutrin  might be helpful. After about three weeks I finally felt the increased energy and was so excited. I got up and I cleaned my daughters room. But the next day I started feeling very drugged. And very out of it. So I decided I should stop taking it. That was the worst decision I’ve ever made. It was not easy to get off off this like my other medication‘s. I assume because I only been on it for three weeks it would be easy to just stop taking it. Before I had mild depression. Now my depression is so bad all I can do is cry and I don’t wanna get out of bed. I’ve had suicidal thoughts running rampant because I feel like that’s the only way to make it stop. This medicine is very scary and I would highly advise against it.,WorseThanIWas
10,Wellbutrin,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 29, 2021",5,I have never reviewed a medication before but my experience with Wellbutrin is so dramatic.  I tried a few other antidepressants over the years.  Some left me feeling numb while others helped alleviate my depression/anxiety but got rid my sex drive and energy levels.  So basically the other medication took away the things that made me feel human.  Wellbutrin has a very different effect.  My energy level has increased and my sex drive is at a normal level.  I feel like it has also helped with my ADHD.  Wellbutrin doesn’t help my anxiety but because I have energy to get up and do stuff I am personally able to ease my anxiety through exercise.  I felt very dizzy for a couple days near the start but thankfully that has completely gone away. I highly recommend trying this medication if others don’t work for you.,Wow!

13,Wellbutrin,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 3, 2021",6,"Best antidepressant I've ever taken, and the only one that balances out my brain chemicals while allowing me to feel like myself. I wasn't serious about taking it pre-covid, but after the pandemic, I became very depressed. I went to my doctor who put me back on Wellbutrin, and within the first hour of taking it, it felt like a light switched on in my brain. I scoffed down my food, went home and cleaned up, submitted my job applications, and fell asleep early. The next three months with it were magical. But let me tell you, medication is NOT the only way to solve your problems. I began to relapse after 4 months because I had a lot going on. You have to make life changes. I finally did and got off of them, but I lost motivation in my interests. Just got back on them yesterday, and I feel a difference, although not as drastic as when I took it after the pandemic. I might wanna increase the dosage. This drug may also increase anxiety.",Anon girl
14,Wellbutrin,Depression,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 9, 2021",7,"I’ll start by saying that these types of drugs work differently for everyone so keep that in mind!! I have severe OCD (intrusive thoughts) and anxiety along with minor depression. I was prescribed Wellbutrin to give me a better overall sense of well-being. I knew going into this that it takes a while and there can be adverse side effects. Simply put, this drug sent me into a deep spiral. It made my response to intrusive thoughts worse, I had intense nightmares about my intrusive thoughts, and it made depression enhanced. I remember I would wake up every morning with a tight feeling in my chest because I was so anxious!! I had several panic episodes (one in public and another at home.) Overall, I just had a sense of hopelessness that things wouldn’t get better. I also could not be alone as these side effects got worse when I was alone. I know this drug works well for some people, but it did not work for me.",Sara

16,Wellbutrin,Depression,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 20, 2021",3,"When I first started taking 150mg of wellbutrin, the first 4 or 5 or so days I literally couldn't sit still after taking it. I had to do something, anything. I'd say I was borderline manic. Then, after that point, it just stopped working. now I find myself sitting in the same spot for hours not realizing how much time has passed and not having the will to do much of anything. not to mention, it feels like I've stopped thinking, like there is a fog in my head. Other meds I've taken/am taking (like zoloft) do not have this effect. would not recommend.",Ray
17,Wellbutrin,Depression,1.0,,"August 20, 2021",9,"150 mg XR. I have low dopamine so I thought with would be awesome for my adhd. Wrong! The first week was AWESOME. I felt more awake, motivated, and less hungry. Cool right? Week 2  I started getting a little irritable.. maybe because I couldn’t freaking sleep! I've never had sleep issues EVER until this. By week 3 I was extremely manic. Horribly paranoid. I had racing thoughts that wouldn’t stop. I am going through a divorce so you can imagine all I wanted to do was GO INSANE because of my hatred for this man. It was not manageable on this medication. I was so thirsty, my head felt like a balloon, extremely confused and forgetful, most awake I've ever felt, couldn’t breathe right, constipated. Went to ER.. they didn’t do ANYTHING. The medical field is an absolute joke. Also, I was BREASTFEEDING… I was told it would not affect my baby. Ha!!! As soon as I stopped the meds she stopped crying, started sleeping again, and regular poops again.",Kate
18,Wellbutrin,Depression,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 14, 2021",3,"Used it for depression and symptoms of ADHD as well as for the cannabis/weed withdrawal. Quit weed for 3 weeks than planned to start the medication. Took 150mg for a less than a week. Starting from 2nd day and I felt energized, focused and less irritated, first thing to be cured my useless thoughts & OCD which caused anxiety and depression on the long run. After the 4th day I started to get sensitive to people’s words including my family and get so ragged yet controlling it. But that wasn’t the real problem, the real issue is that I start to have an extreme heart rate & blood pressure so impulsed that I felt it. And I can deal with any side effect unless it’s the heart, not sure though if that was panic attack or a heart issue. So I quit on the end of day 6. Rested for 2 days and smoked again in day 8 and can’t feel any happier specially that the heart rhythm is getting back to normal. I guess you need to check your blood pressure before using this med",The Unhealthy
19,Wellbutrin,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 11, 2021",3,"I suffer from low mood and anxiety.  I had read about Wellbutrin in the past, but only recently my doctor recommended it.  I'm quite fit, exercise, eat well, get as much sleep as I can, as I believe they are the three pillars to manage your physical and mental status.   This Wellbutrin seems to be a magic pill.  Day 1. Motivation increased immediately, and WANTED to do physical work at my parents place?? After that I had terrible anxiety and depression for the rest of the day and was fatigued. Day 2. (Today) Totally motivated, fully social, no anxiety, I feel myself, getting numerous things done, but all in a controlled way, I'm 46 and have my libido back big time..  I'm actually shocked. My doc said take 1 tablet as soon as I wake up (150mgSR) for 3 days, then switch to 2 tablets from day 4.  I know this is ridiculously early to write on here.. but give this med a go!

20,Wellbutrin,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 8, 2021",10,"I have found Wellbutrin to be the best for me.  I've tried Zoloft, Lexapro, Cymbalta, Adderall, Vyvanse, Prozac and Straterra.  These others made me too agitated or too zombie-ish.  No dry mouth, no jaw clenching, no yawning, no RLS, no anxiousness, no headaches with Wellbutrin/Bupropion.  Feel uplifted, more my old self, laugh and love easier and anxiety a bit better.  Less achy too!  My long-term memory has even improved. I don't mind the vivid dreams, kind of fun.  I do have some side effects which make me wish and plead for a lower dosage to be available.  I'm taking 150 XL here in the USA.  I really wish they'd make a 75 XL for sensitive types like me.  I often get into a hyperfocus mode with this dosage of Wellbutrin.  I can get a ton of reading done, internet research, etc, but then procrastinate things of higher priority.  Please, manufacturers, please offer 75 XL as well.  I think you'd be helping a ton of people.",Sunshine
21,Wellbutrin,Depression,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 28, 2021",3,"**WARNING FOR THOSE WHO ARE BIPOLAR** For the first 4 years, Wellbutrin greatly helped my depression, ADHD, self-image, motivation, and overall quality of life. I began on 50mg was later raised to 150mg. After that, I stopped taking it for 3 months. I became depressed, and was unaware I had Bipolar at the time. After that, I called my psychiatrist and he told me to start back at 150mg. For about a month before I stopped this medication, I had psychosis. I was convinced I was dying, and was in constant fear. I had delusions that I was developing a terminal illness, that I was going blind, that my spine was going to snap and leave me paralyzed. I also became detached with reality, believing everything was a simulation, that other people were robots, the only thing that I knew was real was myself. I also had minor hallucinations, like the wall swirling. This medication can either drastically improve quality of life, or it can be hell.",Agitha

23,Wellbutrin,Depression,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 18, 2021",7,"I had to stop Prozac which worked very well on me but unfortunately started causing neutropenia and related skin problems.  The doctor recommended Wellbutrin 75mg for a week then to increase to 150mg. Straight after the first dose I developed hands twitching / tremors and felt in general very jittery. I could never increase it to 150mg. I felt weird, one min hyper, the next min tired. Did not sleep or feel very well. I’ve been on it for 4 weeks and really struggling. Prozac worked very well on me, Wellbutrin in dopamine and noradrenaline so completely different neurotransmitters to Prozac.  I am starting now Vortioxetine, which is a newer generation SSRI with less side effect etc. Hoping for better days",Eva
24,Wellbutrin,Depression,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 11, 2021",20,"I have ADHD and I've been on adderall for years and years and have tried lexapro in the past. Wellbutrin is a whole different ball game. I have had numerous drug issues from marijuana to alcohol to cocaine, and wellbutrin helps immensely with them. I think I am sensitive to it, but on just 150mg within a week or so I was able to quit nicotine no problem. It just became completely unappetizing. Self control and just general energy/desire to live life to the fullest are the biggest things I noticed. When I first started this med I sometimes felt like I couldn't get drunk and felt very weird when drunk or high on marijuana. I've gotten very emotional/crazy while drunk, so I don't recommend it. Also got very emotional the month after I came off it. Experienced spasms in my stomach as well at night time when trying to sleep but I think that's just me. Definitely worth a try much better than SSRIs!",troubled

I wasn’t as hopelessly sad as I had been the week prior, but I was experiencing an array of stomach-related side effects (constipated until I was very much no longer constipated, bloating, stomach aches, & VERY nauseous the first night). Fast forward a few days, I still can’t sleep very much. I’m artificially active is the best way to describe it. I’ve been pretty inactive throughout the pandemic, but I walked to get iced coffee in 90 degree heat, cleaned my apartment, had people over, then went to the gym later because I was so jittery and couldn’t sit still. It also has given me quite a bit of anxiety and some irritability alongside the constant need to be active.

It is now two weeks into it and I decided to stop it today. My experience on this drug was great the first 2-3 days but now, it gave me anxiety. I only experienced 1 anxiety attack many years ago. Here is what I experienced: My tongue felt like it was swollen. One night I felt I couldn't swallow and that created anxiety. One of my leg often twitches, I realized I was sometimes stuttering when trying to form words, sounds were increased, I also had a constant metallic taste in my mouth. It altered the taste of everything and I used to love eating, even gums I chewed. When walking I felt like I was floating, brain fog, lack of energy. I took this medication with another one, Concerta for ADD. I am not sure if it is a good mix and will verify with my doctor. For now, I have decided to get off it.

The jittery side-effects made me look forward to getting off it then. However, now I have no side effects, sleep great, my focus on work is back, and find it is easier to do my usual lifestyle routine to address my depression.

38,Wellbutrin,Depression,6.0,,"February 5, 2021",51,"I started taking 100mg of Wellbutrin 2 months ago. I was prescribed it for ADHD but I also suffer from severe depression. The first four days of this drug were absolutely awful, I cried and felt an extreme hopelessness. After the second week the sadness was fading but I felt numb, the only positive thing is that it has decreased my irritability HEAVILY like I used to snap at so many small things and now I am unbothered but this has been replaced with sensitivity and getting emotional/crying easily. Also has helped with my sex drive. It hasn’t helped for my ADHD, I also no longer have an appetite. Two days ago I was bumped up to 300mg a day and the first day taking it I went back into the same despair I felt, but the suicidal thoughts were worse this time but luckily my boyfriend was there.

I felt terrible! To make matters worse, my normally low heart rate (around 50 beats per minute) skyrocketed to 130-140. I felt delirious and I immediately went off of it. I almost went to the ER but I decided to stay home and monitor my own symptoms as I'm in Healthcare myself.

Now the I started school again at 37 the stress of everything and finding out that I may possibly have ADD or ADHD makes every so much better. I was initially put on Wellbutrin 150mg a day along side my 15 mgs of Lexapro. My Wellbutrin was bumped up to 300mgs to help me quit dipping. For a while things were finally going well. I didn’t touch a can of dip for about two months. Then the realization of everything kicked in. Between working full time, going to school for biomedical equipment technology full time, and a girlfriend who drives me crazy sometimes, my anxiety, stress and everything else has gone through the roof.

43,Wellbutrin,Depression,2.0,,"January 3, 2021",39,"It is amazing to see the variability in how people respond to Wellbutrin!! However, this is common for most psychotropic medications. I started taking it to see if it would help with my Seasonal Affective Disorder and Fibromyalgia. I started to feel more energetic, creative and almost stoned within the first week. I felt so much better I decided to leave my 23 year marriage because I felt like I now had the energy to break free and find a more positive relationship. However, after two and a half months on Wellbutrin, only at 100 mg, I started to feel edgy, anxious and ""not myself"". I was feeling like I was losing myself and it was starting to be quite scary!! After two days off of the med now I am feeling like myself again. When we take meds like this we really need to monitor whether we are doing better or worse overall. Whatever you do, make sure you are doing psychotherapy at the same time. Whatever you do, don't give up on yourself!!",Joseph1957

I have a very sensitive body so I started on 75 mg once a day. Man. I noticed a difference within the first day or two. The third day I woke up with tons of energy and unpacked my suitcase that had been sitting in my closet for a week, before I even started working! Unheard of for me. My outlook on life has improved, I don't snap at my husband, I don't get annoyed. Plus I've lost 4 lbs and my sex drive has increased slightly. The only side effects I've had were the brain ""zingers"" people talk about (they have subsided) and pretty bad insomnia.

Wishful thinking is a good way to put it.So here's my question: Since I was already taking Bupropion at 150 mg/day extended release should I expect the new dosage of 300 mg to take eight weeks to fully kick in?

I was suicidal with no emotions or appetite.I told my doc and started Wellbutrin 300mg. I was wary because the last 2 meds I took didn’t help.2 weeks later, after Cymbalta’s horrific withdrawal ended, my emotions returned. I could enjoy things again. By week 4, I was happy for the 1st time in years. I could cry again (a weird thing to be happy about, but it felt good to feel again).I had mild side effects: a dry mouth and shaky hands.I think how I felt the following year is how healthy people feel. I’ve never felt better.In fall 2018, things went downhill. I was having panic attacks and dark depressing thoughts. I thought it was stress, so I reduced my workload. It didn’t work. I was depressed/anxious daily until now because I was too nervous to tell anyone.Last week my doc prescribed an extra 150mg (450mg total). Nothing yet, but the higher dose may help.

I’m constantly paranoid, like to the point where I’m a raging hypochondriac who is afraid of being poisoned and can’t leave the house. I had anxiety pre-Wellbutrin, but NEVER this extreme.The reason I don’t recommend this to anyone with BED (or people who fear weight gain), is because every time I try to come off it, I’ll go into a binge-eating frenzy. Like, I’m ravenous 24/7, and I can’t seem to get control of my appetite no matter how hard I try. Sure, it’s nice to go back on it and lose 10 pounds without much effort, but those appetite suppressant effects wear off quickly and it’s not worth the levels of paranoia (and in no way does it counteract the 20+ pounds I gain when I attempt to stop taking it).",btzuko

The only side effects I’ve noticed is that my cholesterol levels are going up but I am trying to control that by my diet. I don’t like taking pills but this one is the only one I take besides vitamins. It helped me quit smoking, (when Chantix made me nauseous) so two thumbs up!!",Still Not Smoking

I’ve dealt with anxiety before— but a life transition triggered a massive downward spiral filled with panic, sleeplessness (yet still too much sleep), decreased focus, extreme apathy, no motivation, suicidal thoughts, unrealistic fears, etc. PCP suggested  Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, I desperately agreed. I felt like medication was my last hope. Within 2 weeks, I felt like I was able to function (improved motivation). Within a month, my anxiety and other symptoms were under control. I experienced side effects for the first week— headache, some impulsivity. And for the first month, my sleep schedule was disturbed (I tried moving the time I took Wellbutrin... sometimes it helped, but the side effect was gone by month 2 anyway). Wellbutrin  saved my life. I’ve been on Wellbutrin for 4 months now. It doesn’t fix everything of course, but it really helps me combined with healthy coping and CBT.",Kate

It also lowered my blood pressure about 20 points, which made standing up problematic. I was next switched to Wellbutrin, but not enough as it turned out. The dosage prescribed worked up to 300 mg . This dose left me on edge, and I switched again after 4 months. Then to Zoloft, 150 mg. This worked well also, but the sexual side effects were manifested after 5 months and totally unacceptable. I then switched back to Wellbutrin again, to mitigate the Zoloft side effects, but worked up to 450 mg, the maximum non-clinical dosage. But there is a cost.

My doctor weaned me off Zoloft and prescribed Wellbutrin. The first few weeks I immediately noticed an increased sensitivity in all my senses. There was kind of a wind tunnel effect in my ears, my body was more sensitive to the touch (great for sex life), I became hyper-sensitive to noise/vibration (a negative) and I had a keener sense of smell (not always positive). I had trouble getting or staying asleep. I stayed on it for six weeks, but when my fuse got shorter and I became very hostile and angry, I was weaned off of Wellbutrin and changed to Celexa.

I went for a month having one side effect after the other. One week would be sleepless nights, the next would be general irritation at everything and everyone and perhaps the worst was nausea. I stuck it out and I am extremely glad I did. It has been amazing for me. I am much more motivated and excited about life. It increased my sex drive 100%!

I finally hit an incredibly stressful period in my life last year that made me feel completely hopeless every minute of every day.

I have been better able to focus at work, cigarettes tasted disgusting and I have noticed a decease in my desire to engage in compulsive activities.
