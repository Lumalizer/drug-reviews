1,Bupropion,Depression,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 11, 2022",0,"Wellbutrin XL (bupropion):I started Bupropion in Jan 2022.  I was diagnosed in 2007 with Bipolar II Disorder, but also have, Depression, Anxiety, ADHD.  I have been on various antipsychotics & SSRI/SSNRI antidepressants for at least twenty years.  My depression has always been problematic. I have achieved significant relief with my current medicine regimen, which is Sertraline 100mg x1, Lamotrigine 250 mg x1, and Bupropion 450mg daily. I titrated up Bupropion XL from 150mg to 450mg over the course of two weeks.  Side effects first included severe constipation, headaches, stomach ache, & an increase in anxiety.  After about two weeks, those side effects abated.  When I up it to 300mg, I developed some leg restlessness ( not Akithisia), which abated in about three days. When I titrated up to 450mg, I developed diarrhea for three days.  I am now on the 450s with no serious side effects.For me, the Bupropion only started working when I reached 450mg. Although it has not been a game changer, I feel that it safely & effectively complements my other meds.",Dave

Just a little harder to fall asleep. When I started taking it I immediately had more energy, didn't want to vape, and ate way less. I never felt hungry. The past week it seems like it's not as effective. I'm eating and vaping like normal and not as much energy but still better than without it. Thinking about asking for a dose increase.",Bryan

7,Bupropion,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 23, 2022",2,"Wellbutrin (bupropion):Coming off of paroxetine I have found bupropion to be a god send.  The sexual side effects of paroxetine became too much to handle.  I was hoping they would mitigate to some degree but they did not.  Tadalafil solved the ED problem but not the lack of interest or inability to orgasm.  I asked my doctor to put me on bupropion and he started me on 150mg daily and has now increased it to 300mg daily.  My mood and depression have been replaced with just being happy.  No anxiety.  No depression.  It's the first time I've felt normal in a very long time.  Sex?  It has returned in spades.  The desire, arousal, and ability to orgasm and ejaculate are back full force and then some.  The orgasms are incredible!  Bupropion has allowed me to treat my depression without sacrificing my sex life.",cowhow

10,Bupropion,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 21, 2022",8,"Wellbutrin (bupropion):Wellbutrin has been a life saver for me! I have a background of depression, suicidal ideation, OCD, intrusive thoughts and anxiety. I'm 24 and I have been on it at a dose of 150mg for a few months now and my mood has improved significantly with no side effects besides mild weight loss. The intrusive thoughts have largely gone away and I actually feel hopeful for the first time in a decade. Since starting it, I've been able to get on a normal sleeping schedule for the first time in years. I have also lost about 5 pounds, though that is through a combination of efforts and variables. I was scared to try antidepressants for a LONG time, and before Wellbutrin I tried Prozac, which didn't work well for me and gave me tremors. I was a little hesitant to try another drug after that but I took the chance and it has truly improved my life in ways I can't even express. I'm so thankful for this medication.",Anonymous

It solved my issue of being extremely tired, sleeping wouldn't charge my batteries, lustless, dull, no motivation, & I could sleep all day. Went to 2 clinics. Tested some and nothing helped. After I tried zolpidem to sleep my short term memory went to shreds.  So I went to a 3rd clinic. after 5 mins the woman prescribed me wellbutrin and told me to come back in 2 weeks. 2 w later I came back, full with energy, shaved, had my life back. So thankful I found the right med. Please keep testing meds till you find the right one!! I was diagnosed ADD, attention deficit disorder and have some feel for depression. 2d after i stop wellbutrin I get tired, +10% every day! Side effect: brain fog if mixed with alcohol.

This drug has been a GAME CHANGER, 300 XL mg in am.  For the first time in my life (now in my 40s) I once again see life in color and want to participate, I have a routine, I can get up in the morning, fall asleep at night, be productive the entire day, stay organized and on top of things - without any effort. Mood is the most stable it has ever been - not even getting PMS/PMDD.  I take this with Armodafinil.  Given the panic and anxiety issues these drugs are known to induce, we had always steered clear of them, but ran out of options. They paradoxically make me much calmer and greatly reduce anxiety - when all the SSRIs made me far worse, even causing psychosis and anaphalxsis.  SNRIs numbed me out, as kept increasing dose. It's THE BEST anti-depressant for me by far - none of the high energy/anger/anxiety many report.",Beautiful Life

16,Bupropion,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 26, 2022",0,"I started taking Wellbutrin over a year ago and feel that it definitely has had a positive impact on my life. I also started taking modafinil about a month after I started Wellbutrin so I don’t know how much I can attribute to either but I will say I am much happier and have the ability to wake up feeling good enough to have a normal day instead of dragging myself out of bed most days (the other days I didn’t get out of bed). I’ve taken Zoloft in the past and I luckily don’t recall many of any side effects, but I feel like Wellbutrin has only had positive affects on me. I’ve lost about 20 lbs since last year and I think it’s because either Wellbutrin, modafinil or the combination stabilized my appetite. It’s helped me form a much healthier relationship with food. Now I eat whatever I want but my body doesn’t make me feel like I want to over do it in quantity. I take 300 mg/d",Akhannah

Depression is completely gone. ADHD at work has completely gone too. I'm more productive than ever before. If you are reading the reviews and hesitant about starting, don't be.

22,Bupropion,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 28, 2021",0,"I suffered with untreated depression, SAD and ADD. I struggled with all the classic depression issues (sleeping, no appetite, negative thoughts) + ADD. Covid hit, things only got worse (suicidal thoughts, heavy drinking, isolation, not eating) so I decided to finally try medication. And, I'm so glad I did. I did struggle with the side effects, but they didn't effect me as terribly. However, the effect on my mood and my life has been drastic. I'm no longer exhausted for just existing, I don't sleep all the time and my thoughts no longer seek to kill me. I finally have goals, hopes and ambitions for the future. And I finally have the energy to start recovering. If any of this resonates with you, please please please try this medication. The side effects will affect you in some way but the long term outcome far out weighs the first few months.Dosage: 150 MG x 2 a day",Cherie

I'm in 150mg slow-release, I'll try a month. I will probably ask for 300 mg because of the mild effects, I think a higher dose could affect me more.

I tried many SSRI's before this and had terrible side-effects with them.First 2-3 weeks on the medication for the first time left me with intermediate bouts of nausea and feeling like my nerves and stomach were on end, almost like when you are super anxious just before a job interview for an example, almost like you are slightly shivering, were you feel all your muscles and stomach tensed up to the point they're shaking. That's where the nausea comes in. After the 2-3 weeks for the first time taking it I felt totally fine.6 years later, I'm taking 300mg and found the perfect balance when combined with 10mg of Buspirone to counteract any anxiety side-effects Bupropion causes.

So I started looking for what I could do to fix it I started taking some medication that made me feel like a zombie so I started doing my own research and found that Wellbutrin  might be helpful. After about three weeks I finally felt the increased energy and was so excited. I got up and I cleaned my daughters room. But the next day I started feeling very drugged. And very out of it. So I decided I should stop taking it. That was the worst decision I’ve ever made. It was not easy to get off off this like my other medication‘s. I assume because I only been on it for three weeks it would be easy to just stop taking it. Before I had mild depression. Now my depression is so bad all I can do is cry and I don’t wanna get out of bed. I’ve had suicidal thoughts running rampant because I feel like that’s the only way to make it stop. This medicine is very scary and I would highly advise against it.,WorseThanIWas

Immediately I noticed the boost in energy it gave me, which was really nice. The first two weeks or so were really hard as it made me question my own sanity a couple times until the medication would kick in after about 2 hours. It slowly started to mellow out and eventually I was bumped to 300 mg. It was fine for the most part and the only difference I noticed is that I was able to do more in the day, SOMETIMES. Some days I would feel the benefits of it and some days I  would be absolutely drained and exhausted. It also made me lose a good 25 lbs. from not having any appetite. Recently though its gotten too much and made me extremely agitated all the time and almost manic so now I am back to 150 to see if it works any better bc I refuse to go on something that will make me gain weight like Prozac did.

The psychiatrist had just discontinued Abilify but I continued with 120 mg duloxetine when the Bupropion was added. I was never suicidal during this 2 month interval but was unable to perform more than a few basic tasks a day. My best friend talked me out of some dumb financial decisions because she saw the change in me while Bup was ramping up. I have been stable for almost 4 years on the Bup/duloxetine combo. I swore I would tell the whole world that bupropion did indeed become effective but only at the two month mark.

I tried a few other antidepressants over the years.  Some left me feeling numb while others helped alleviate my depression/anxiety but got rid my sex drive and energy levels.  So basically the other medication took away the things that made me feel human.  Wellbutrin has a very different effect.  My energy level has increased and my sex drive is at a normal level.  I feel like it has also helped with my ADHD.  Wellbutrin doesn’t help my anxiety but because I have energy to get up and do stuff I am personally able to ease my anxiety through exercise.  I felt very dizzy for a couple days near the start but thankfully that has completely gone away. I highly recommend trying this medication if others don’t work for you.,Wow!

I’d be worried when I felt okay that any minute I wouldn’t be able to breathe. Once I went to the emergency room and to urgent care thinking there was something wrong with my lungs but they were healthy. I took it for a year and turns out that medicine caused me severe anxiety and panic attacks that I never before experienced in the 30 years I’d been alive. Horrible feeling.

The problem that I had with Wellbutrin is that it seemed to lose its effectiveness pretty quickly. After a few months, I went up to 300mg and the increase didn't seem to help my depression much, but it did make me more anxious and eradicated my appetite. 150mg is a better dose for me. Increased energy, increase sex drive, slightly lowered appetite which helped me reduce emotional eating. For me, Wellbutrin was better for increasing my happiness, rather than decreasing my depression. I think that Wellbutrin would pair well with an SSRI for increased motivation, energy and sex drive, while the SSRI treats anxiety and lowers the floor of depression.",Anonymous

The first four days of this drug were absolutely awful, I cried and felt an extreme hopelessness. After the second week the sadness was fading but I felt numb, the only positive thing is that it has decreased my irritability HEAVILY like I used to snap at so many small things and now I am unbothered but this has been replaced with sensitivity and getting emotional/crying easily. Also has helped with my sex drive. It hasn’t helped for my ADHD, I also no longer have an appetite. Two days ago I was bumped up to 300mg a day and the first day taking it I went back into the same despair I felt, but the suicidal thoughts were worse this time but luckily my boyfriend was there. I’m not sure if this is worth taking in the long run but I’d rather be more emotional then have the irritability come back. Wishing everyone suffering from depression lots of love:)",Shy Cab

I felt terrible! To make matters worse, my normally low heart rate (around 50 beats per minute) skyrocketed to 130-140. I felt delirious and I immediately went off of it. I almost went to the ER but I decided to stay home and monitor my own symptoms as I'm in Healthcare myself. Currently, day two off of it, but I am still experiencing flu-like symptoms and now eye pain with dizziness.

I figured out this stuff was stirring up pent-up anger from years of interpersonal trauma, which I was then projecting onto others.

My focus was better, and my mood was noticeably improved. However, over the past week I've noticed increasing difficulty reaching climax during sex. I still get an erection, but it seems like the sensation never builds enough to achieve an orgasm, which has left me frustrated. Talked with my doctor today and am going to go back to 150 mg/day to see if that helps.

Some restlessness or a stupor-kind of feeling for a couple hours in the afternoon. All of this subsided as the months passed. 1-2 years lead to some kind of tolerance. 300mg doses seemed to give me some more focus but also made feel a bit off. Enhances the focus a little more, and likely possible overt wakefulness, irritability or confusion would subside over time. I still couldn't estimate needing such a dose myself.

And, I wasn’t as tired throughout the day, which is really nice because I am normally exhausted day round. Now, I just realized that I am not fixating on things as I used to.

Took a while to kick in,  Waiting eight weeks for the hoped-for effect was like waiting eight months. I had tried another med and it left me with negative sexual side effects which is why the doctor suggested Bupropion. I've been taking low dose Viagra, honestly don't know if I need it . . . but Viagra works. I told my doctor that I'm okay, but don't seem to feel any drastic change from when I first began the med. She suggested upping to 300 mg extended release. After a week I began to feel better but, don't know if it is from the med or the high of knowing I made the attempt at trying to feel better. Wishful thinking is a good way to put it.So here's my question: Since I was already taking Bupropion at 150 mg/day extended release should I expect the new dosage of 300 mg to take eight weeks to fully kick in?

I've been on 30MG of Lexapro for several years.  I recently experienced a personal setback and the Lexapro was no longer helping. I was afraid of the side effects of Wellbutrin but decided to try it anyway. I started out on a 1/2 of a 150MG tablet.  I already had high anxiety and this medicine did make it worse in the beginning.  There were days where I thought I can't take this another day.  I took 75Mg for about 2 weeks and then upped the dosage to 150MG and cut the Lexapro down to 25MG.  By doing this, I felt so much better. Today, I feel about 75% better.  I will eventually move up to 300MG.  The side effects I experienced were nervousness, anxiety and a minor loss of appetite.  I hope this helps as reading several of these reviews were extremely helpful in making my decision when I was searching for a medicine to try. Best of luck to all of you!",momto1son

I had been working through some difficult things with my psychologist - but crying for days - and the emotional upheaval still was not like me.  One of the things that I did like about the medicine was that I was able to sleep.  With the increase, I could not sleep - hardly at all.  I was only getting three hours a night.

Lexapro helped with some of the anxiety caused by Wellbutrin but I'm pretty sure now that Wellbutrin has made me more susceptible to manic episodes.

I'm currently on Lamictal, Vyvanse, & Lexapro. I'm sure wellbutrin works well for others but it wasn't a great fit for BP for me personally.

Lost 3 lbs in the first month b/c my energy was back up to normal levels. (I take 150 mg of the WB XL) Research also shows that a SSRI + WB is an excellent treatment. all three neurotransmitters needed for depression treatment are raised (serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine). I'm a person in recovery as well so I do think the dopamine from the WB can help folks like me since that is what is often raised when we drink or drug. WB is the only drug on the market that targets dopamine.",allison_G

Am probably going to have to come off anti depressants as no quality of life with the zombie affect. Any advice be appreciated. :(,SpaceCowGal

When you first take it, it first has to build up in your system over a week or so.  After just a few days, you get increased energy as norepinephrine and a little bit of dopamine are increased.  This continues for about a week to a week and a half, until your brain builds up a tolerance to the neurotransmitters by increasing the number of reuptake pumps for them.  So, then you feel lethargic for another week or a little more, until the reuptake pumps finally get either overwhelmed or desensitized by the constant flood of new neurotransmitters.  Then, quite suddenly and unexpectedly, you get hit with energy again.  The energy is not euphoric but quite steady.",Please don't call me Bob

Some days I felt happy and energetic but other days I felt crazy  like an emotional mess(also a lot of shaking). Not sure if the drug or life circumstances were responsible.
