0,Paxil,Depression,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 27, 2021",1,"Perhaps this med might work for anyone who can take SSRI antidepressants, but I cannot. Even though I clearly informed by doctor of this fact he prescribed it in its generic form. I did not recognize the name, but he told me it is not an SSRI antidepressant. After only the second day my reactions were so severe (dizziness, shaking  feeling weird) that I looked up the generic name and quickly learned it is the same as the SSRI antidepressant Paxil. Immediately I discontinued its use, but after 2 days I still the strong reaction. How can I counteract these horrible effects?",Gringo

2,Paxil,Depression,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 17, 2021",3,"Depression left me feeling like I was walking on a paper-thin sheet of ice every day for years, one small negative event or interaction would immediately have the ice give way underneath me. I’d be pulled down into a place where my thoughts terrified me and I knew it was only a matter of time until I gave into them. After about 3 weeks or so on the drug, it did not elevate my mood or make me feel like a different person; it gave a much sturdier feel to the ground beneath me. Things that I knew would send me immediately spiraling didn’t have such a strong affect anymore. I now have stability in my racing mind and it’s been life saving.I tried coming off Paxil for a bit and right away my brain felt….shattered, fragile again. I am back on it and while it does help tremendously I wish I didn’t have to rely on it. Only real negative side effect I experience is weight gain, well, that and routine long pharmacy lines, but it’s worth it.",SayNoToPugs

4,Paxil,Depression,3.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 14, 2021",4,I just finished weaning off Paxil. It took about 2 months to get off of it. I always forgot to take it daily. I noticed when I felt like rubbish and thought oh I didn’t take my Paxil today. I didn’t want to be dependent on that drug anymore. I shaved a bit off each day. The withdrawal was AWFUL!!!! The worst part was the pins and needle feelings on my skin. I almost went back to it to stop the feeling. I knew it was out of my body because I suddenly got my sex drive back! It was GONE for 15 years!!!! I’m now on Wellbutrin and I feel amazing! I have feelings again. I can laugh and cry. PAXIL took my humanity. My pharmacist told me she was so happy to see me not picking up the Paxil every month. She said it’s the worst drug. I’m giving it a 3 rating because maybe it kept me from killing myself or staying in bed all day. Getting off of it took forever but I feel so much better! Don’t start this drug. Ask your Dr for Wellbutrin.,Anonymous
5,Paxil,Depression,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 8, 2021",1,"Went off anti-depressants a couple years ago and decided to start taking them again. For GAD, OCD, and depression.Doctor recommended 10mg Paxil to start. Day 5 was one of the worst days of my life. I had severe, intense, and persistent anxiety for over 5 hours.

It worked beautifully to improve my mood within 4 days, however, I am (this is recent) ""wired"" and can't fall asleep. I am going to stop the Paxil and try Trazodone and see if it helps. I LOVE Paxil as an antidepressant (I was on 10mg) but it made me feel buzzed and wired and hurt my already bad insomnia.If you have no sleep issues and need it for depression and/or anxiety, I would give it a try.",CJ
7,Paxil,Depression,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 16, 2021",5,"Ive had insomnia for almost 5 years after a stressful event in my life. The stress passed but the insomnia stayed. I've tried sleep meds and off label antidepressants for sleep but nothing ever really worked. I always wake up after 3-4 hours without being able to fall asleep again. Mind racing with catchy lyrics over and over. My life was a mess and I became depressed. I finally tried a daytime antidepressant for actual depression and it was paxil. After 3 days I felt sooooo much better. Even tho I wasn't sleeping better. My mood was elevated and I just saw the positive in life. I forgot how that felt. Sadly, I stopped the meds due to sexual side effects. I couldn't get an erection or orgasm even if I masturbated. That was a no for me so now I'm on wellbutrin with no side effects at all. Still not sleeping better but I feel good so and less worried about not sleeping. hopefully that helps my insomnia eventually.",Deem

9,Paxil,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 6, 2021",108,"This medication has been very potent to improve my anxiety/depression disorders. No more suicidal thoughts, fear, mood swings, shaking, sweating, anxiety(SAD & GAD), and the list goes on. If you're suffering from severe anxiety and depression, then take the Paxil. I am taking 40mg max dose with no side effects. I added BuSpar on top of Paxil and my anxiety has reduced tremendously. Some people do have problems with BuSpar but I have great results and I’m loving it. I take 20mg/a day. Life is so great, don’t let your anxiety/depression ruin your life. You’re strong and brave.

I feel into a severely depressed and anxious state for over 2 years. I just convinced my Dr to put me back on Paxil as I am not longer family planning (divorce).

11,Paxil,Depression,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 24, 2021",7,Unfortunately my doctor prescribed paroxetine 20 mg for over 39 years when I decided to stop and slowly lower from 20-0. I had to do it alone because the doctor did not agree. It took me a year to wean down but then I had a severe panic attack (never had that) and irritation started as well as overall very emotional. It has been 6 months since I stopped and I still battle through every day. Fighting my negative thoughts. But I am convinced I will win this. Unfortunately I can not find any info on this subject... does anybody know about the effects on your brain after using paroxetine for 30 + years and then stopping? Thanks,Bollie
12,Paxil,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 6, 2020",62,"Seems like a lot of people have a good experience with Paxil and I really wish I could say the same. I took it for about 2.5 months and had chronic diarrhea the whole time which only seemed to get worse as time went on. And of course the usual sexual side effects that come with SSRIs. I couldn't handle it anymore, having diarrhea for that long just left me feeling very sick all the time. So I tapered off which is where things have gone from bad to worse. I've never had a problem coming off of any type of medication in my life but this is HORRIBLE. Brain zaps, nightmares, highly increase depression and crying spells. This stuff is freaking poison to my body. I would never recommend this to anyone.",Skye

Fast forward to present day.  I now use a mobility scooter / electric bike due to suffering horrible physical symptoms of CFS /M.E. which were triggered by coming off this drug 11 YEARS AGO.  My circadian rhythm is utterly destroyed as is my stamina.  I constantly live in a heightened state of hyper arousal.

Paxil helped me treat my depression but as soon as I determined my symptoms of depression was due to ADHD I decided to get off of it. It's been like living in the depths of a dark pit. Paxil helps you but destroys you. Please please please please please weigh your options. I've been on it for awhile and getting off of it is WORSE! I can and can't suggest this medication or any antidepressant. I urge you to determine what is causing your depression and treat that underlying problem. It will save you from these types of medication that will develop a strong dependence and the minute you do not need them and decide to go off them, it's going to be an absolute WAR! It is possible stay strong, stay positive. Always get second opinions never assume because you owe it to your life.

So my overall quality of life didn't improve as much as I would have liked on this med. I feel like this might be a better med for just anxiety than depression for some people?

I was so sad. I didn't want to feel like that. Now 15+ years later I can barely orgasm. When I do it's not the same and never has been since. It makes me depressed just thinking about that. I was misdiagnosed with depression because I was a rebellious teen. Now I'm stuck with the side effects for life probably. I don't know if I'll ever be the same after this drug. Don't take it.

I have so much less suicidal thoughts now that I am back on this medicine; I don’t even want to commit suicide. I still have problems, but they are much less severe. The only thing I really do not like about this medication is what it has done to my body. I am naturally thin but this medication has made me gain weight, about 10 pounds. And the worse part is that I have bloating in my stomach area. The rest of my body is fine, still thin, but my stomach sticks out to the point where people have asked me if I’m pregnant. I’m sure a good bit of my belly fat is a result of me drinking so much soda and not eating the best foods, but when I was off this medicine my stomach was a lot less fat. Literally it’s just my stomach that is fat not the rest of my body. This medication does also increase your appetite. Still, it’s a great medicine for depression and OCD.",Lindsey
29,Paxil,Depression,1.0,,"March 26, 2019",15,"I suffer from depression. I always feel everyone hates me. That I am useless. Etc.  Paxil started off wonderful. Was on 20mg. I was on this high for weeks. I was goofy, fun, talkative. A massive opposite to what I was before when I started paxil. It felt like I was in another body. Now and then I would go out with friends or have a date night with my husband and have a drink or two. As soon as I had that ONE drink since starting paxil....that led me down a very very dark path. Being only 22 years old I basically became an alcoholic out of no where. My tolerance for alcohol was incredible. I never felt a hangover. I was constantly buying beer. Drinking 6 a night. Every night. Weekends would be double the amount. I missed many days of work. Suicide became a friend. Paxil ruined me. I started cutting out of no where. So deep that I had to go to the hospital one  morning. My libido. Gone. No where to be found. Which really sucked as a newly wed of only 1 1/2 years.",Becks

I started gaining weight (6lbs in 4 weeks) and I could tell my sex drive was fading. I thought that my body would eventually adapt. A few weeks into it I was trying to make love to my wife and I could not have an orgasm. That was the last straw. If you want to be a fat zombie that can’t have an orgasm, well the big pharma chemists at GlaxoSmithKline have got a pill for you!

I gained a total of 18 pounds in the first 4 months. I had taken other SSRI’s before and never experienced weight gain so I thought why take Paxil if I can take something else that doesn’t cause extreme weight gain.  I began tapering off like I always have when I wanted to stop a medication and what I experienced was pretty awful. Let me just give you the breakdown: Brain zaps (constantly). Electric shocks going through my head (constantly). Dizziness when standing. Vertigo. Diarrhea every single day. Chills. Insomnia (I didn’t sleep once for 4 days straight).

I also had moderate  anxiety.In summary, Paxil might help anyone who experienced GI irritation from other meds, has trouble sleeping, and has some anxiety component to their depression",CraigsTown

90,Paxil,Depression,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 17, 2015",305,"I have always felt like something was wrong for as long as I can remember.  I think my depression is just normal to me and I've probably been depressed for many years without even knowing, just a feeling that something isn't right.   A failed relationship a while back, heightened my realisation that something is wrong and the pain of losing someone close was like a final straw for me.  I guess it might be true that everyone comes into your life for a reason, even if it is only meant to be for a short time.  After countless months and days googling and doing tests online, trying to figure out what might be wrong with me, I finally got the courage to go see my doctor.  After a few visits, he prescribed me Paxil and thinks this might help get me on the right track.  You see my depression isn't the usual in that I try to go about my daily life as normal as I can, it's called walking or smiling depression.  Behind it all though, I'm crippled with self doubt, negative thoughts, anxiety and constant feeling of sadness.  I feel guilty a lot, distance myself from my family and friends regularly and sometimes feel so down I cry for what seems like no reason at all.  I put on brave face to people and go about daily life as best I can, but behind the mask I am suffering.  I never really felt like I fit in and it's like I have to try to act to be happy in every day situations.  It's hard to describe, but it's almost like I'm standing behind my shadow.  I always look at other people and wonder what it's like to be just happy. I could never bring myself to telling anyone how I really felt, I guess it's only the last year or so that I became more aware and really accepting that something isn't right.  It's been so long that I have felt this way, I really don't know what normal is anymore.  I have lost 2 girlfriends  largely due to my low self esteem and low confidence finally taking its toll on the relationship, it's like I just expected them to leave, who would want to stay with a loser like me is how I portrayed myself to them.. That's probably the hardest pill to swallow through all this.  I know if I was mentally stronger, I could have held on to something good.I know I have it in me to go change my life around.  Everybody sees it in me, but I feel trapped in my own body and mind.  I have a lot of trouble concentrating and I seem to always be so indecisive about what action to take.I guess I'm wondering what I can expect from taking Paxil.  I know I'm the only one who can physically make changes, but can I expect to regain some self confidence and motivation, energy etc? I really don't know what to expect from this drug and am apprehensive about what it can actually do for me.  I guess part of me just wants to try do everything by myself, but I really don't want to waste another second of my life.

It also took away my ability to orgasm. I'm a 21 y/o (20 at the time) college girl who is a pretty sexually open person.
