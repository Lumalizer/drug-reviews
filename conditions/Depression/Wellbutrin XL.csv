0,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 11, 2022",0,"I started Bupropion in Jan 2022.  I was diagnosed in 2007 with Bipolar II Disorder, but also have, Depression, Anxiety, ADHD.  I have been on various antipsychotics & SSRI/SSNRI antidepressants for at least twenty years.  My depression has always been problematic. I have achieved significant relief with my current medicine regimen, which is Sertraline 100mg x1, Lamotrigine 250 mg x1, and Bupropion 450mg daily. I titrated up Bupropion XL from 150mg to 450mg over the course of two weeks.  Side effects first included severe constipation, headaches, stomach ache, & an increase in anxiety.  After about two weeks, those side effects abated.  When I up it to 300mg, I developed some leg restlessness ( not Akithisia), which abated in about three days. When I titrated up to 450mg, I developed diarrhea for three days.  I am now on the 450s with no serious side effects.For me, the Bupropion only started working when I reached 450mg. Although it has not been a game changer, I feel that it safely & effectively complements my other meds.",Dave
1,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 7, 2022",1,"I started wellbutrin xl 150mg about a month ago. I didn't really have any negative side effects. Just a little harder to fall asleep. When I started taking it I immediately had more energy, didn't want to vape, and ate way less. I never felt hungry. The past week it seems like it's not as effective. I'm eating and vaping like normal and not as much energy but still better than without it. Thinking about asking for a dose increase.",Bryan
2,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,6.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 21, 2022",1,"I take seroquel 50 mg in am and 150mg bedtime. I take Clonazapan 1/2 mg in the am and 1 mg at 3:00. And I take 150 mg of Wellbutrin xl in am. Seroquel helps me fall asleep. Clonazapan (Klonopin) gets rid of some anxiety. But I feel awful, always fatigued, depressed, irritable, moody, loneliness, quick to anger and self non social. My psychiatrist said there’s no magic pill, take a walk outside  I have no desire to talk to people never mind going outside what am I supposed to do?",Andytheman

5,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 8, 2021",0,"I've had mild depression since quarantine, no major anxiety.  While searching for a therapist my doctor prescribed 150mg of Wellbutrin.  First 2 days the normal side effects did NOT bother me:  interrupted sleep and ZERO appetite.  Day 3  (3 hours after taking it) I had the worst panic attack with intrusive thoughts.  I was disassociated and confused.  I started having some paranoid thoughts, couldn't understand people or how to respond.  Would go to get water and get end up at the wrong cabinet.  I thought if I continued I might have a psychotic episode, wouldn't be able to make it 2 weeks.  Some positive effects peeking through, increased libido strangely enough, but negative effects far outweighed.  Going to try 5mg of Lexapro to see how that goes.",Anonymous

7,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 9, 2021",3,"Female-38-125lbs. 150mgI just started taking it 12 days ago. I have suffered from depression/anxiety most of my life and it took a bad turn this past year. I am normally an overall healthy person: exercised regularly, ate healthy, do not drink or smoke.  I knew I needed help when I completely lost interest in life. Stopped working out, didn’t care what I ate, or to even eat, barely left the house, and didn’t want to socialize with anyone, not even my husband. My Dr. wanted me to try bupropion. I was actually excited to try something that would hopefully give me desire to do all the things I wanted to do. Luckily, I had very mild side effects: a little tummy discomfort, slight dizziness, no appetite, thirsty, but nothing major, until MY HAIR STARTED FALLING OUT! I’m not talking a little, like handfuls!  I have very thick, long hair. It’s already so thin after two weeks! Anyone else experience this? Did you have to go off med, or did you find a solution??",Jenny
8,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 7, 2021",1,"I took 150 mg of Wellbutrin XL for almost two years. At first, it worked wonders and got me out of a deep depression. Within two weeks of starting, I had increased motivation and interest in life again. The problem that I had with Wellbutrin is that it seemed to lose its effectiveness pretty quickly. After a few months, I went up to 300mg and the increase didn't seem to help my depression much, but it did make me more anxious and eradicated my appetite. 150mg is a better dose for me. Increased energy, increase sex drive, slightly lowered appetite which helped me reduce emotional eating. For me, Wellbutrin was better for increasing my happiness, rather than decreasing my depression. I think that Wellbutrin would pair well with an SSRI for increased motivation, energy and sex drive, while the SSRI treats anxiety and lowers the floor of depression.",Anonymous
9,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 6, 2021",2,"For me, Wellbutrin was a real miracle drug in treating my moderate-severe depression. After just 2 days I was restored, especially in terms of my cognitive performance. In terms of general perception and state of mind, I feel present, real, and without perceptual distortion. The depressive symptoms were also gone. With SSRIs, the whole world felt somewhat unreal, as if in cotton candy, and the emotional world kind of washed out and without amplitude, which I quickly grew to resent.The side effects are limited, with the lower quality of sleep being the most noticeable. Notably, there are no sexual side effects quite unlike SSRIs. There are no significant side effects that prevent long-term use.",Kep1234
10,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,8.0,,"September 10, 2021",1,"I was prescribed wellbutrin XL (24hr) for depression, caused by what my doctor and I believe is due to post acute withdrawal caused by my previous alcohol consumption. I experienced some drowsiness so I take it a few hours before bed... I've been on for 2 weeks. I have noticed a decrease in food cravings as well as a slight loss of appetite, so maybe I'll lose weight which would be a benefit. My mood is significantly better and I'm currently on my period so that's says something!",Carissa23
11,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 23, 2021",1,I suffer more from anxiety than depression. I've been on 300mg Wellbutrin XL for several weeks and I'm thinking about getting off of it due to issues with sleep. I'm not sure if it is the Wellbutrin but I'm getting lots of anxiety attacks throughout the day and I feel exhausted from lack of sleep. I was told by my new doctor that Wellbutrin is not good for anxiety. It's like adding gasoline to fire. I am also taking Luvox but it takes too long to work. I'm getting off the Wellbutrin and taking Adderall with Luvox. It is good for the mood and helps me organize my busy mind so I can deal with the intrusive thoughts. To me Adderall XR is like adding water to the fire. It doesn't put it out completely but it does control it better. More Dopamine and less norepinephrine.,Funktown
12,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 21, 2021",6,"I have struggled for years with depression, executive function, and low energy. I would stay in my home when not at work because I just didn’t have the willpower to do anything. I suffer from C-PTSD and my memory and cognition suffered to the point I’ve almost lost my job. After my second write up I decided to get some help and started 150 mg of Wellbutrin. This medication had an almost immediate effect and within a week people in my life noticing I was becoming myself again. I still had some issues so after 2 months I’m now taking 300 mg. I now have more energy and have been doing everything I put off for years. I feel so much more confident about myself and abilities, my social anxiety is way lower now that I’m not stumbling to remember words, my high stress job has gotten much easier. I do have issues with sleep so I try to take it first thing in the morning but besides that I can’t imagine going back.",Kitte
13,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 10, 2021",3,"Bottom line: 300mg/day of the generic bupropion XL seems to really help. I've spent most of the past year fighting insomnia, depression, anxiety, and, worst of all, a debilitating fatigue that kept me lying in bed doing nothing for weeks on end. I think at one point the fatigue was caused by depression, then I suspect it was the side effect of 15mg mirtazapine and/or 10mg Lexapro, which I was also taking. I started with 100mg of instant release bupropion, which seemed to help a bit, but eventually dropped Lexpro, cut the mirtazapine to 7.5mg, and upped the bupropion XL to 300mg. It seems to be doing the trick. I'm functional again. Only side effects: little dizziness, mild-to-moderate headache. I can live with those SEs to be functional again.",Anonymous
14,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,8.0,,"August 6, 2021",2,"My first couple months with this drug was only 75 mg. I recently just started taking 150mg daily now.  I haven’t really seen much of a difference in anything. I’m still fatigued and pretty much how I’ve always been. I hope changing the dosage helps. I also take 20 mg buspar daily for anxiety.. Wellbutrin hasn’t gave me any bad side affects at all. When I first started taking it at 75 mg I definitely had the racing thoughts and a little bit of the insomnia but other than that, zero negative side affects. I was happy for that because I’ve always been really nervous about medication because of the side affects they can have..  I wouldn’t down this drug in anyway, I just hope it starts working for me like it has for a lot of people.",Anonymous
15,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2021",4,"I started Wellbutrin XL 150mg a week ago for anxiety. I was fine for the first couple of days. I actually thought it might be working. By day three, I started to develop a bad headache and dizziness. On day four, add muscle and joint aches. By day five, I was still experiencing all of these symptoms plus ringing in the ears and shortness of breath. Wellbutrin gradually increased my anxiety, and lead to a severe panic attack that almost landed me in the ER. My physician took me off the medicine right away and prescribed something else. Wellbutrin does seem to help others. It just wasn’t the right medicine for me. Everybody is different. Good luck in your search for wellness.",Scott
16,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,1.0,,"May 8, 2021",10,"I've taken cymbalta, venlafaxine, escitalopram and nothing has worked. First days I was shaking from energy, wrote an entire essay in an entire day, I've never felt so euphoric, didn't have to sleep as much (honestly the way I describe it it sounds like mania but yknow). Then it stopped working, went up to 300mg. Biggest mistake ever, I got 10 times worse. My OCD came back, my BED came back (bordering on anorexia), hypochondria got 10 times worse, I got depressed and started having suicidal thoughts. Took that for 1 month (after 1 month on 150mg) and I was hanging on threads the last week, we went down to 150mg and worse I got. I felt suicidal, I've never been so suicidal in my life. Stopped it and a week after all my suicidal thoughts went away but I'm still disabled from the effects, still underweight and I'm on sick leave 100% cause I haven't recovered. I regret everyday that I took this, but I couldn't know. I'm gonna try something else.",S
17,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,10.0,,"May 1, 2021",72,"I was given Wellbutrin XL in addition to Zoloft to help treat depression and help with ADHD. It took me a good 4 weeks of regular use to make a decision if I was happy with it or not. I almost quit a week in, 2 weeks, 3 weeks in because I was feeling numb. I had to make myself laugh. I was boring to be around. But then literally one morning about a month into it, I noticed immediately. I was motivated, hopeful, focused, could think clearly. I could hear myself thinking. And actively planning and executing. I thought maybe for a few days I was just having good days but it's been like this ever since. Sure, I still have low days or not so great weeks but that's being human and I can get through it.  Overall, I'm so glad I stick with it. Please note that I did not have suicidal thoughts or was in a deep low spot. I was just, numb. So don't think I dealt with suicidal thoughts and pushed through it. Please talk to your Dr if you feel lower after beginning the med.",Laura
18,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 9, 2021",15,"I started taking Wellbutrin XL for depression and ADHD. It helped greatly with focus and depression , I could pay attention in meetings , could read books better, felt less depressed. It made me feel really good after taking it for a month or so. But after a month,  I had severe constipation, difficulty evacuating bowels almost to the point of getting hemorrhoids  and excessive pain while passing stools. I do not want to stop taking it because it definitely makes me feel better but I cannot live with the constipation and hence will have to stop. My doctor has prescribed Prozac for depression, and I will start that this week and see if it works for me. But if people don’t face constipation and other side effects, this is a very good drug to treat ADHD and depression. Hope they make a new version without the side effects.",Ajay
19,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,8.0,,"February 17, 2021",15,"I’ve been on Wellbutrin XL for about 5 months. I started at 150 mg SR. The first few days I noticed a big increase in anxiety but only twice it was intense enough that I couldn’t function. After a few weeks and a follow up with my GP, we switched to 150 XL and it helped as it’s a slower release. The positive side effects definitely outnumbered the negative. I almost immediately felt more energy and couldn’t stay in bed all day if I’d wanted to (this had been an issue for me), I had more motivation and a bit more focus. I’d been on Cipralex for years previously and found it took the edge off my irritability and managing mood swings but wasn’t a significant change. My GP and I were drawn to the weight loss side effect as I’ve put on 60 pounds over 8 years and two pregnancies. I did not see any difference in weight even with an increase in energy.All in all I like Wellbutrin and it has more pros than cons.",NH

It didn’t really affect my depression because my depression stems more from my anxiety. I still decide to take it cause maybe it just works well enough idk. Well for the last four days I have had extreme itching from my ankles to my scalp. Then they would turn into hives. Not only that but all my joints have become inflamed and I have to bumps on my heels which makes it really hard to walk. It has been the worst four days of my life. I’ve tried every type of itch cream and home remedies with little to no success. It started the night I had a 2 beers. Idk if it is that or if it’s just from medication.

22,Wellbutrin XL,Depression,8.0,,"February 6, 2021",101,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar II and C-PTSD in 2015. I tried a handful of different medications, but I was also dependent on alcohol. I stopped drinking August 2020 and soon after went med-free (supervised) to see where I was at. What appeared to come about was depression mostly. When I started 150mg buproprion HCL XL, within 48 hrs I felt more energy, more activated emotions, less fog. It caused me to be more agitated and angry at first, but I knew it was because I was coming from complete numbness to actually having some feelings. I am now a month in and I feel happy about where I am with my mood. I say definitely give it a chance, especially if you are not a fan of SSRIs. Give it a few weeks and log your feelings. Being on this is far better than where I was in my depression. I wanted to share my experience and feelings because it has given me some hope and I want to share that with others.",MJ

The lack of appetite did help me lose 5 lbs the first week, but I felt super sick anytime I didn't eat and had to force food down to feel better. I may have had a little more energy though. Third week- started to feel better! Side affects lessoned and I had a sex drive for two days. Fourth week- feel terrible again. I have most of the side affects back except loss of appetite and insomnia. I am sleeping fine and probably gained all my weight back. And no sex drive.

I’ve been suffering from Anxiety/ADD/Depression forever. I resisted and  procrastinated to take meds again for years because of not so great experiences with SSRI’s but also because I read way too much online which scared me off.  So I suffered for years until one really bad episode that forced me to take action.  I asked my doc to give me Wellbutrin (Bupropion) since it had the least negative reviews (from my years of online self-help nonsense).  Started 150mg of Wellbutrin XL for 3 weeks then 300 mg plus 10mg of Citalopram ever since . It’s been LIFE CHANGING really!  It’s crazy how I can finally function like a normal human being. I swore to myself that I would write a review here if I found the remedy to my suffering, so here it is.  Wellbutrin XL 300mg+10mg of Citalopram has worked wonders for me.

When I was at 150mg I had more anxiety attacks, but when I went to 300mg I felt like a normal human being (still having panic attacks, but they were due to being in a bad relationship).

I’m definitely not as weepy & a little more optimistic but it has not helped my anxiety much. I do have more energy. I still cry at times but not as long or much & I still have all my range of emotions & get annoyed with my family and worry about everything.

I will eventually move up to 300MG.  The side effects I experienced were nervousness, anxiety and a minor loss of appetite.  I hope this helps as reading several of these reviews were extremely helpful in making my decision when I was searching for a medicine to try. Best of luck to all of you!",momto1son

Before, my depression made me so fatigued, unfocused and unmotivated that I progressed in life at the rate of a sloth. SSRI's never managed to fix those issues.

Very mild side effects (ringing in ears occasionally, a few hours less sleep the first week or two, sweating) compared to the benefits. Most side effects went away around the 2 week mark.

The other thing that may or may not be related to WB is that I have chronic constipation.  I say may or may not because I'm scared to get off of WB to see if that's what's causing it.  Different drugs work differently on different people of course but, like another person suggested, it also kept me from gaining weight until menopause. Hope this helps.",lillytree63

Anyway Wellbutrin XL 300 in one month has moved me out of a 3 year funk of sleeping all day if I could. Getting nothing done and things piling up, getting up to go all day and living off of 6, 7, 8 hours of sleep in a day, reduced eating in a good way and I could go on about any number of positives.Funny how I could be this lucky to find the drug that works for me. An inhibitor of dopamine re-uptake rather than ever being involved with taking various SSRIs as a first line of attack. So far I have nothing negative to say about this medicine except I wish I found this earlier for me.",Anonymous

I have been on Yaz for 3 years and never had a problem until I started taking the Wellbutrin XL, so I am going to discontinue use.

I was very depressed in the fall and I'm not in the clear yet, but since starting Wellbutrin two and a half months ago I have improved greatly.  To lessen side effects, my psychiatrist started me with 150 mg before raising the dose to 300 mg after two weeks.  Three weeks after that, my mood took a bit of a downturn, but nothing like before I went on the medication.  Yesterday, therefore, my doctor prescribed the highest possible dose of 450 mg.  I am also trying to sleep and eat well and exercise regularly to help my depression.  I’m not 100% yet but I’m trying to have some faith in this process.  If this doesn't do the trick she'll add another medication in conjunction with Wellbutrin.",allie77

I started out at 150 mg, then a couple years later went to 300 mg, then just recently my husband passed away and the dose was upped to 450 mg which is the maximum.
