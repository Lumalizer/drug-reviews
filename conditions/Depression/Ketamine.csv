0,Ketamine,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2022",2,"Excellent a real life saver if you went through all the rubbish psycho drugs Zoloft Prozac  but you have to try them even if they hurt you like they did me this is the first thing that has gotten me out of the nightmare the VA AND GIESSINGER left me in. I have my life back after only one treatment, six more to go.  the treatment can be a little in nerving but compared to Depression and  Anxiety it’s nothing",VET
1,Ketamine,Depression,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 8, 2022",5,This will be my 3rd treatment so far I do not feel any differently but I’m hoping this 3rd one today will be beneficial to my depression problems. And true it is a real trip while the infusion last for about 40 min. Then you come out of it about 15-20 min later. It’s not pleasant to me but I’m desperate to find something to have my life back as depression has stolen many years as with social anxiety.,Brenda
2,Ketamine,Depression,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 3, 2022",4,I've been given ketamine treatments now for between 6 to 8 months. My depression medication wasn't helping much and I was having a really bad depressive episode where I had a plan to end my time here on earth. I decided to give myself one more chance. I researched treatment resistant depression and ketamine popped up. I learned as much as I could before getting in with the clinic to discuss options. I was approved for treatment and since then my life has actually been pretty great as far as depression goes. It took away the suicidal thoughts immediately after my first injection. I finished my initial treatments and go back for maintenance treatments and it's been 6 weeks since my last. I can tell I need it because the negative thinking and thoughts of not wanting to be here creep back in. So I'll go in Friday and get topped up and be right as rain for a while!,NotDefeatedYet
3,Ketamine,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 3, 2022",3,"Ketamine has been a life saver for me.  It is the only medicine that can pull me out of deep, depressive, suicidal despair nearly instantly.  It really is miraculous how quickly and completely it improves my overall mood, outlook and demeanor.   Ketamine also provides me with deep, often profound insights into my psyche.  These insights help me to understand, process and let go of past trauma I sometimes wasn’t even aware was affecting me.  Finally, it is comforting to know that, per numerous scientific publications, Ketamine actually heals and encourages new growth within the brain.The only downsides of Ketamine are that it is fairly expensive, and the positive effects tend to fade after a few weeks (making follow-up infusions desirable).   Because of this, I take a low dose of Lexapro (a medicine which didn’t help me much on its own) to extend the benefits I feel from Ketamine.  I am so thankful to have found this treatment.",Elbarto150
4,Ketamine,Depression,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 27, 2022",10,"I have used ketamine injections administered in a medical setting by a psychiatrist for major depressive disorder, after trying more than a dozen medications over the past 30 years.  I also have chronic headaches and brain fog, and have chronic pain from arthritis in my neck and peripheral neuropathy.My experience has been nothing short of remarkable.  I experienced short-term and immediate relief from depression, augmented with antidepressants for longer-term treatment.  A mild euphoric feeling after the first treatments diminishes over hours and days and I no longer get this.  I  have had improvement in depression, pain.  Ketamine has given me an ability to be objective or explore recurrent negative thought patterns and get out of self-defeating ""loops"".  It has given me confidence, a feeling of relaxation, focus, energy.  Dose started low (0.25 g/kg body weight) and have been more beneficial (but more dissociative) at 0.8g/kg of body weight.",Serge
5,Ketamine,Depression,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 19, 2022",8,"Did two infusions for depression at 0.7mg/kg. The infusions went fine, but my suicidal thoughts got really bad following treatment. It also caused me to start self harming again. If I had done a third infusion, I would’ve ended up in the psych ward. Please be careful with this stuff.",cheeriobee
6,Ketamine,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 13, 2022",38,"My goodness did this therapy help me SO MUCH!after TEN YEARS of anxiety, panic attacks and depression - I painted my nails, I dyed my hair, I went and bought arts and crafts materials to start some art projects, I cooked meals, I did my dishes..It gave me back my personality.And its all thanks to my Dr's  and the  ketamine Clinics THANK YOU! From the bottom of my heart.",Caryn
7,Ketamine,Depression,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 14, 2021",62,"Ketamine therapy saved my life.  I had been put on every medication for depression since I was 11 and nothing worked. I tried ECT, Medications, TMS, and had been in and out of treatment centers for depression and self harm for 10 years. About a month into ketamine treatments, I started noticing slight differences-I wasn’t hoping a car would hit me. I was able to say that I feel ok today, instead of I’m fine (while dying on the inside). I did 12 sessions and two maintenance. I wish I could have been a case study so I could show that this WORKS. I’m able to live a life where I don’t want to die everyday. I have a beautiful daughter, haven’t self harmed in two years, and genuinely feel ok on a day to day basis.",CAR5412
