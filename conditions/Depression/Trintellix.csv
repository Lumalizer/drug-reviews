0,Trintellix,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 31, 2022",2,"On Trintellix for 3 months for  GAD. Not a fun time on this stuff. It constipated me so bad, it sent me to the hospital twice for diverticulitis (and I had no prior history of this). Once I stopped taking this drug I went back to normal.  Did not work for my anxiety/depression at all, made me feel dialled into the wrong radio station. Worked all the way up to 15mg, doctor tried to get me on 20mg, told her to get me off this stuff and switch me to something different! I asked her many times to switch, to which she said ""you have to give it time to work!"". Listen, if you try it out and you feel it's not going to work, make sure you ask to be switched and be firm!",rybai

2,Trintellix,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 28, 2022",1,I have severe PTSD and major depression.  I have tried multiple medications and all of them had horrible side effects.  I started taking 10 mg at the end of November 2021.  So far my depression has improved significantly with no side effects at this time.  I had a little nausea and dizziness the first two weeks.  Side note this medication has caused the least sexual side effects.  Libido has been average but I am able to have ejaculations which was not possible on the other meds.   So far this has been a good medication for me.,AJ1932

The side effects were horrific but most of all--I went from being extremely depressed and turned into the Incredible Hulk.  And I'm not talking about the new mamby-pamby Incredible Hulk, I am talking full-on Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk.  It did NOTHING For the depression.  At the same time, my husband's closest coworker was on trintellix, as well, so my poor husband was getting ripped to shreds at home AND at work.  DO NOT SEEK THIS TREASURE.  JUST SAY NO to TRINTELLIX.",wallflower

My thought process is better, my sleep is better, racing thoughts have improved. My brain is able to process things a lot better.

5,Trintellix,Depression,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 9, 2022",0,I noticed positive effects on my bi polar 2 on the lowest dose of 5mg's. It lifted my depression and mood to a more positive motivated and functional one with in just a few days! I have had no side effects except weight gain but this could be due to another med I'm taking.The downside. For the positive effects didn't last and my Dr. increased me up to the highest dose gradually with the same results. Only a short term increase in mood. I'm now on 20 mg's.For me the medication seems to peak then I  level out to a just a sub par result but definitely better with the med than without it.As far as side effects. So far the best antidepressant I've taken in regards to no side effects.It is somewhat expensive since it's brand name only at this time.Probably better than taking nothing.,JC77
6,Trintellix,Depression,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 2, 2022",5,"It took years for me to find the right medication. I have GAD/PTSD, and have been on every antidepressant you can think of. This is the only medication that has worked for me! I felt relief the first week! The side effects for me were minimal, just a little bit of nausea that went away 4 days later. I nibbled on some crackers with peanut butter and that took the ickiness away. Make sure to drink plenty of water when on this medication, it can leave you with a little dryness in your mouth.  I am so happy, because this medication makes me feel normal! I can focus, the depression is gone, and the anxiety is not an issue for me now. I am so grateful! I can be me again!!",Sabrina Moreno
7,Trintellix,Depression,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 8, 2021",5,"I had the most strange experience with this med. It gave me such severe diarrhea that I ended up with hemorrhoids. The hemorrhoids then became so severe that I had a rectal banding procedure. At the time, I had no idea that the med was causing this. The rectal banding ulcerated, and I ended up hospitalized to have the banding removed. It took forever to heal until I put 2 and 2 together and got off the Trintellix. Once off, I healed very quickly.",Jillpp

9,Trintellix,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 6, 2021",5,"I started the first two weeks on 5mg and it wasn’t good because of the side effects (nausea, sweating, difficulty concentrating, etc.). BUT once I passed that part, the side effects were barely noticeable. I increased the dosage to 10mg and it’s the right dosage for me. The medication really helps my mood and I’m more able to see the bright side of a situation than ever before. I feel more calm and happy and I got my motivation back. It’s not a miracle pill I had to work on myself (do sport, see some friends, making projects, etc.), but in my case I can tell with no doubts that medication really helps me after fews weeks (4-5 weeks). Plus, I had no problem with alcohol consumption (moderate) and It has zero effect on my libido and weight gain, which is truly amazing for me.",Username123

14,Trintellix,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 23, 2021",26,"Took the full 8 weeks to adjust with a lot of stomach upset at first, but it gradually  took away my anxiety which was making it hard to function. I was much better but still had some depressive thoughts/early waking (minus anxiety) - Doc explained 10mg treats anxiety, 15mg makes no difference and 20mg will treat the depression. So after a while I opted to level up and got some adjustment turbulence again for a couple of weeks - then I was all good. Much much better. Living life in a calmer and more constructive way. None of the sexual dysfunction side effects I got from escitalopram (lexapro - which was great for me othersiwe.) I swore I’d come back and review as I relied so heavily on reading these while I was waiting for relief.

15,Trintellix,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 10, 2021",2,"This med was awful. I have tried so many anti-depressants and this was the worst. I have a sensitive stomach already but this med made me so nauseous. I missed several days of work from home because I couldn’t sit up without puking. Forget enjoying even a social drink on these meds, one beer made me puke over 30 times. I thought I had food poisoning. The nausea lasts all day but is particularly bad in the morning. After a month of being on this med, even looking at the pill makes me nauseous and has made tapering down the dose impossible so I am left with withdrawals. Unfortunately, I will never know if this med worked for my depression because it made me so sick. Suggest having your doctors fill an RX anti-nausea if you want to attempt this drug.",BDD

Only mild diarrhea, mild headaches and mild to moderate dizziness.  I just went up to 10mg this morning and it has not been good for me.  I am suicidal, don't want to do anything at all, major anxiety and restlessness.  I am going back down to 5mg.  Besides this it has been so good for my depression.  I want to get up in the morning and it has also helped with intrusive thoughts.  They are not gone entirely but are a lot better to manage.  All in all, I'm having a good experience with Trintellix.

It worked wonders (I went from over worrying to function perfectly normally) but the sexual side effects were stressing me. I started to feel well and therefore I wanted to get to know people, but sex was weird and orgasm difficult to reach (I’m a 32 year old male). Switched to brintellix 10mg, in 3 days I went from 1h to orgasm to 10 minutes. What I can say is that after some initial unease adjusting to the tapering up of brintellix (no nausea, just generally feeling unwell/sick/fatigued and headaches) after 1 week I have no more side effects. I don’t feel as up in mood as with escitalopram but for now it’s ok. Maybe it will improve. It feels very gentle and not so intense in effect as escitalopram.",MG.

I have tried so many anti-depressents in the past and couldn't tolerate the side effects. I feel the same as normal but just happier. I am going through some really awful things in my life and will try increasing to 20mg to see if it helps even more. But, for those like me who are sensitive to drugs, this one works for me. I'm a petite woman in late 40s. I get headaches, feel nervous or weird and sick to my stomach on most drugs. This has caused NO problems and I don't feel numb either.

28,Trintellix,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 17, 2021",4,"I have been taking Trintellix for at least at least a year.  I started out at 5 mg and my doctor increased my dose to 10 mg. I have a long history of antidepressant use.  For 25 years, Prozac was a lifesaver and I was able to work and function in society. Then Prozac stopped working for me and I experienced a slow decent into a terrible depression along with crippling anxiety and insomnia. My doctor put me on Paxil which made me feel like a Zombie.  I also tried several other antidepressants that did not work. Then I was prescribed Trintellix which helped bring me out of depression and increased my quality of life. My anxiety symptoms have also been reduced, however, I still have insomnia. I have had problems with nausea when I take the 10mg dose of Trintellix so my dosage was reduced to 5 mg. I have been on that dose for almost 2 weeks and my nausea symptoms have improved. The only other issue is the cost.

I then tried taking it at lunch time after I had eaten my lunch thinking taking it with food would help for sure. Unfortunately it didn’t and taking it at night didn’t either. I woke up nauseous every morning. I let this be my normal for as long as I could (six 1/2 months) but I felt awful. I had no appetite. I lost nearly 30lbs which yeah sounds awesome right?It’s not!!

I started on 5mg in the morning and I'm not sure if it was the Trintellix but my mood and depression worsened to the point of suicidal ideation. Fortunately, I was in a hospital environment. I suffered nausea but it was manageable. Around day 6, I started to feel a little better. By day 8 I actually felt happy for the first time in a long time. Additionally, my thinking became much clearer. Cloudy thinking had been a problem with other SSRIs. I'm now on day 10 and increased to 10mg with no adverse reactions. One lesson I've learned is that SSRIs do different things to different people. Given Psychiatrists don't know exactly how these drugs work/differ from each other, it's a case of trying one, giving it 6-8 weeks to work and if it's not working go back to your Doctor.",p247

I’ve been on Citaloptam, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Mirtazapine, etc. This one seems to be the best tolerated for me. Zoloft and Citalopram took away my sex drive. Wellbutrin made me anxious, suicidal, and an insomniac. Mirtazapine is a great medication. Prob the best one, but the weight gain isn’t for me. I like to have an active sex life and getting fat isn’t on my list. My doctor recommended Trintellix. It does limit my sex drive a little (thankfully I have a high sex drive), but I am still horny and happy. I do struggle to sleep though, so I’m also on Trazadone. If you are skinny, go for mirtazapine, it by far the best for anxiety.",Sask

Wellbutrin 300 XL did absolutely nothing; in fact it may have made me worse. So I started on 5 mg of Trintellix and in days I felt my thoughts more glued and my fear and anxiety subsided enough to stop my suicide ideation.

Unfortunately I did not have a good experience with this medication either. During the first month I felt excessively angry and irritable all day. I knew that wasn't like me but I kept taking the medicine because I know the first month can be rough, and I wanted to see the benefits. The medicine also made me feel sick to my stomach sometimes like a sudden wave of nausea. Things went easier after the first month and a half and I stayed on the same strength for another two months. At the three month marker I felt only slightly better in general and noticed the same occasional sharp dips in mood as when I wasn't taking any medicine.

The drugs we're fed destroys our gut biome, and gut biome is DIRECTLY related to depression. Of course, we all have specific things that ""trigger"" our depression, but the reality is, we have depression and simply pick out things to be sad about. You have to mental power to push through these things, and there are a LOT of treatments out there that don't require an expensive pill that has more side-effects than positives.  As long as you take them, you will be on a constant cycle of depression and switching meds. Try to sit, meditate, get your diet and exercise right, and start really considering how to address your problem and take control of your life, you'll begin to truly feel better.

Happier, patient with my kids, less of the obsessive thoughts and general sadness. I can't fully explain it but I just feel better, more upbeat and positive and better able to handle what is going on. I take it at night right before bed because it does make me nauseous and made me vomit twice in two months. I also bruise easily and have started taking Senna to help the constipation side effect which I am having.

I went to 20 mg and now need to take MiraLax each day (and I'm still not ""normal""). The drug works very well for me--very well. It kicked the deep, dark cloud far enough away to give me a chance to regain clarity. Now, after 10 weeks, the cloud has dissipated. It has helped mildly with anxiety (including social anxiety). It definitely works for me as an anti-depressant. BUT, the constipation is an issue. I'm considering going back down to 10mg to see if it's dosage related. Will discuss with my doctor. By the way, I take it at night--have no nausea and helps me sleep. And I'm experiencing improvement in brain clarity (no fog).  I really, really, really don't want to stop taking this.

I've been on a lot of psych meds in my life and once you get passed the first week or two side effects (which is with any psych drug really) it’s  a miracle as you don’t have cloud thinking. Most of the time patients don’t stick to medication long enough to get past the side effects that make them not feel like themselves and this drug made me feel like myself so I’ll take the initial nausea any day over being depressed. If you can afford it take it over all others. My boyfriend is an MD but not a pysch doctor of any kind so he has no incentive to sell the drug and he was the one to have me try it because among his doctor friends it’s what they recommend and take for depression over anything else.
