5,Trazodone,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 11, 2021",4,"I have to stress don't take everyone's review as a given how trazodone will effect you. Prior to taking the tablet I read reviews and was initially terrified by the reports of negative side effects and people's bad experiences.Unfortunately there will always be more negative reports than good as people don't really feel the need to comment on the good. That's where my review comes in, my personal experience is extremely different to what I had read. Other than a constant headache I have to say this tablet has been a god send for my depression. It's taken away any and all negative thoughts and replaced them with a positive happy version of myself. Plus the extra sleep is an added bonus.I have to stress.....

7,Trazodone,Depression,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 14, 2021",7,"I managed to go ten years without taking anything then my restless leg started up terribly on an evening resulting in a major lack of sleep. My sleep pattern went out the window. I was prescribed a dose of 150mg but I only take 100mg a night and so keep a few spare trazadone for if ever I feel my dose needs upping. I’ve been taking 100mg trazadone for about 6 months now. My restless leg almost stopped immediately. Once you get over the initial first few weeks and let the trazadone get into your system it works amazingly well. I take 100mg about 30 minutes before sleep. I have bipolar too and occasional depression with anxiety and mood swings. The trazadone has completely calmed all that side of me down and definitely helps with sleep. The first few weeks can be tough with the headaches, dry mouth, and brain fog. But once it’s in your system it worked for me very well",Hansjan

I was only given 50mg to start off with. Took it 30 mins before my usual bedtime but it didn’t knock me out like I hoped. Worse was that I had a hung over feeling all the following day, I felt like I’d be hit with a tranquilliser and spent all day laying around. As I look after my daughter I can’t keep on taking this long term to see if the sedation lessens, it’s not feasible for me and I’ll have to try something else.",Khp

Honestly feels like a rough hangover the next day. Within an hour of taking it before bed, my muscles were twitching and my heart rate was around 90 bpm just laying in bed. I woke up groggy, dizzy, and nauseous and my muscles felt all weak and messed up - I fell back in bed just standing up. Throughout the day the twitches have gone away but the headache is rough and the nausea is that constant almost-going-to-throw-up nausea. I was prescribed to take Trazodone along with 200mg Bupropion XR, so I’m not sure how much of this could be drug interactions or minor serotonin syndrome. Anyways, I can’t find an antidepressant that works but I would recommend starting elsewhere and taking Trazodone as a last resort.",Anonymous

Brain fog and trouble focusing. The first night (Sunday) taking this I slept all night and woke up less stressed and started feeling like myself. Brain fog has slowly  gone away.

I am drained within 2 hours of getting up and have to go to bed again. I have tried a few times to get off trazodone but I get to around 55-60 hours awake and give up and take the trazodone again.

16,Trazodone,Depression,3.0,,"February 9, 2021",9,"On Trazdone for bipolar 2. Went to the ER because my depression was terrible. Told nurse that I was having trouble sleeping. She said her husband takes it and loves it, that it has a very short half life, and doesn’t make you groggy in morning. She gave me the 50mgs.  I am highly sensitive to meds. Also on klonopin as needed. My dreams are pretty messed up but it does induce sleep for me, I wake up groggy but coffee wakes me, for the entire day I’m alert and awake but not moving or exercising, eating like a savage, horny as can be. After reading reviews I’ve decided to call it quits after a few nights. Was hoping this would be my miracle drug because I’d been on so many other things in the past but never this one. I feel stoned on it like I have no filter and just say whatever comes to mind, just feel strange and even a bit paranoid about certain little things. Sure does lift my mood though even though I’ve been a total cow today.Bye bye trazodone.",Jo

I asked my family doc for Trazadone 50mg before bed.  I will start there and work up to a dose that puts my life back in order.  L-Tryptophan is an OTC vitamin. 50mg gives me about 4 hours of ""decent"" sleep.  The nightmares are still happening. I will work to slowly increase to 150mg or to a dose that keeps the nightmares away.  A good side effect is it tends to work kinda like Viagra with regard to morning erections.

Didn't even want to engage in conversation with anyone although I did not feel moody. While I do take Klonopin in the AM for anxiety, it doesn't help with my sleep.

22,Trazodone,Depression,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 4, 2020",47,"My doctor prescribed this since Prozac and brintellix wiped me out sexually. Apart from the issue with libido, Prozac suited me perfectly, not so however this drug Trazodone. I was told to take 150mg..which in the light of these reviews seems extreme considering my sensitivity to drugs and my body weight, being petite. As instructed I took it five hours before bedtime. I then slept like a zombie for ten hours and woke feeling groggy with super spaced out eyes the next morning. I felt heavy, drugged and seemed to have lost my sense of balance. It took till lunchtime to feel vaguely normal again. While I do not doubt this would prevent the panic attacks as you would be too out of it to panic, whatever the issue, nuclear attack, invasion of the body snatchers, aliens abducting your children. I had no intention of suffering such extreme side effects. Consequently, I did not take again. The search goes on for the perfect drug. It most definitely is not this one.",Island Girl

This is the one medication I wish I could wean myself off of. Sometimes I skip a dose or two but cannot get too far from it as I will start having symptoms of depression and anxiety again.

24,Trazodone,Depression,2.0,,"April 30, 2020",49,"Doc prescribed me Trazodone for Depression. I started with 25mg because I react very sensitive to meds and the first night I had arrythmia, anxiety, cold sweat and insomnia. These side effects disappeared after 2 weeks except for occasional arrythmia. I slept well in the beginning, but I was also extremely tired during the day. I felt a bit more emotionally stable so I started taking 50mg which was a horrible decision. I had severe sexual dysfunction, wasn't able to feel anything during sex, I slept all day, felt extremely weak, my heart was pounding and I felt like I had to faint a lot. It did nothing for my depression, I felt worse than before! I was crying a lot, and when I wasn't crying I didn't feel anything at all. After a few weeks on 50mg I stopped taking it because I couldn't handle the side effects. Overall I was on Trazodone for 2,5 months.

I was also sleeping too much (9+ hours a night still feeling tired in the morning, nearly impossible to wake up most days). I went from mild to severe depression as the complete lack of energy prevented me from doing anything. Was relying on energy drinks/caffeine/supplements to get through the day.I stopped cold turkey as I couldn't stand them anymore, the withdrawals are truly horrible during the first week : hot flashes, high anxiety, irritability etc. Feel a million times better now.Only rating 3 because of significant help with anxiety.",Avila

But I felt awful in the mornings, foggy and headachy, like I'd been drinking a lot. I do drink a glass of wine a night, so that may exacerbate the side effects- I did feel a little better when I stopped drinking for a while.

My motivation is still pretty low. However I had terrible side effects on several previous medicines, ended up in hospital with some nasty ones! A few dizzy spells for a few weeks is pretty good really!",Anonymous

I have taken my trazodone for a week and I can tell the difference. I lack motivation, I just want to sit on the couch all day, I barely even want to shower. I figured I could stop taking it because I could fall asleep just fine but I couldn't be more wrong. I'm definitely going back on it to help stabilize my moods since I didn't realize how much it really does help.",Anonymous

105,Trazodone,Depression,9.0,,"February 21, 2011",53,I was prescribed Trazodone 50MG about 5 years ago when I went to my doctor complaining with horrible night sweats during my lengthy menopause and I was not getting a restful night of sleep.  He prescribed it for me more for the night sweats than the lack of sleep. My Doctor was right%u2026 It really helped stop my night sweats. I stopped taking the medication for a while and the night sweats and sleepless nights came back within a few days.  I immediately started the medication again and problem solved. I sleep great and rarely have night sweats so that makes my husband very happy as he no longer has to freeze to death with my A/C%u2019s thermostat down so low all the time.  Also another note%u2026 this medication did not give me any withdrawal symptoms.,Anonymous

Not nightmares, but they left me feeling bad and confused. I was able to stay awake and plant flowers, but still felt drugged. I also had an overwhelming feeling of sadness that brought me to tears.

I have been on Trazodone for over 6 years and love it. It is the only medicine I have tried that doesn't give me horrible side effects. I had to keep upping the dosage in the beginning but soon found a dose that worked. The greatest benefit is that it helps me sleep. I have severe insomnia and my depression gets out of control after too many days of not sleeping and trazodone combined with Ambien is helpful. I have no other side effects from it. The difference in depressive symptoms is not dramatic but is helpful. I recommend it for people who have a rough time with side effects from other medicines and for those who can't fall asleep.,Anonymous

Elavil was okay, but Trazodone, when I finally got to it, really kicked ALL my symptoms. I didn't have the side effects of the newer SSRI type medications. Trazodone, did not cause insomnia, but rather allowed me to get to sleep. The SSRI's all caused nervousness, agitation and insomnia.
