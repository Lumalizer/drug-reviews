I have CPTSD from traumatic experiences and neglect while growing up and I have tried plenty of other medications (Prozac did less than nothing for me and Lexapro made me an emotional zombie) and this medication is the only one that has helped get me the strength I need to get out of this depression.,Awip
1,Vortioxetine,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 31, 2022",2,"Trintellix (vortioxetine):On Trintellix for 3 months for  GAD. Not a fun time on this stuff. It constipated me so bad, it sent me to the hospital twice for diverticulitis (and I had no prior history of this). Once I stopped taking this drug I went back to normal.  Did not work for my anxiety/depression at all, made me feel dialled into the wrong radio station. Worked all the way up to 15mg, doctor tried to get me on 20mg, told her to get me off this stuff and switch me to something different! I asked her many times to switch, to which she said ""you have to give it time to work!"". Listen, if you try it out and you feel it's not going to work, make sure you ask to be switched and be firm!",rybai

I have tried multiple medications and all of them had horrible side effects.  I started taking 10 mg at the end of November 2021.  So far my depression has improved significantly with no side effects at this time.  I had a little nausea and dizziness the first two weeks.  Side note this medication has caused the least sexual side effects.  Libido has been average but I am able to have ejaculations which was not possible on the other meds.   So far this has been a good medication for me.,AJ1932

I am the best I’ve ever been but it wasn’t a straight road you have to meet these things halfway and be patient. I didn’t want to do these things but I highly recommend doing gym work, exercise and eating right because it really makes the difference. It took me a 2-3 months to really get back to myself. I also recommend vitamins etc also try your best to avoid alcohol it doesn’t help things",Anonymous

The medication really helps my mood and I’m more able to see the bright side of a situation than ever before. I feel more calm and happy and I got my motivation back.

18,Vortioxetine,Depression,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 4, 2021",3,"I switched to Brintellix after anorgasmia caused by Lexapro. Lexapro worked wonders, otherwise. Brintellix is, in my experience, a much lighter antidepressant than SSRIs. I can still have lows that are low, but they last really short. So what it basically does for me, is that I recover much quicker. I take 20mg, before 20 I could not feel any effect. I would recommend this to someone that has a mild depression, not something tougher. IMPORTANT: I was an ambitious and high functioning person before developing depression and anxiety. Lexapro made me a bit lazy, I was content doing nothing and changing nothing. Brintellix re-balanced me more towards what I used to be, I can work long hours without freaking out now. The only side effect is that I sleep incredibly long hours (average 9-10h per night) vs 6-7 of the past.",supermouse

For around 20 years I was using the more usual meds for depression, all the usual SSRI family.  I did find some success with them in the earlier days but over the previous years they were no longer effective and also I was always feeling tired sleepy all day, which became unacceptable for me.  I switched to vortioxetine and its been excellent, it feels more effective than all those previous meds, and it doesn't make me feel sleepy.  I'm taking 10mg and the only side effect  got during the first month of taking it was, my restless legs syndrome worsened, but that's passed now and I'm back to fine again.

24,Vortioxetine,Depression,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 17, 2021",0,I have HOCD  and I tried a lot of SSRIs and had very bad side effects with them all. I started by taking a 5mg of vortioxetine and cutting it into even small bits so I could SLOWLY dip my toes into SSRI's again. I was very worried about it. The only think I had the first week was nausea and gas and I worked my way up to 20mg a day. I feel AMAZING! The OCD I had was horrible and landed me in the ER. I had lost 15-20lbs and was in bad shape. The weight gain I have now was much needed and I'm at a steady weight that works for my height. I'm SO grateful I did this. I was also doing Exposure Therapy before and during adding in vortioxetine - I find that is a great way to talk out and better understand the OCD.

Forget enjoying even a social drink on these meds, one beer made me puke over 30 times. I thought I had food poisoning. The nausea lasts all day but is particularly bad in the morning. After a month of being on this med, even looking at the pill makes me nauseous and has made tapering down the dose impossible so I am left with withdrawals.

28,Vortioxetine,Depression,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2021",3,"I'm writing this review on my father's behalf with permission, adding my own comments as a family member. He was prescribed this drug at 10mg for depression, replacing a combination of escitalopram (10mg) and bupropion (150mg). The reason being that ""it'd provide a faster effect"" than the said previous combination. It did perk up his mood quite quickly, but it unfortunately turned out to make him easily agitated and angry. He'd snap over the smallest things, cursing and yelling, and then came the regret. Not a good cycle to be stuck in. It was awkward for us both, because dad's normally a nice and reasonable man. His psychiatrist discontinued the drug after many of the conflicts I described, going back to escitalopram and bupropion. And what a great decision that was!

What I can say is that after some initial unease adjusting to the tapering up of brintellix (no nausea, just generally feeling unwell/sick/fatigued and headaches) after 1 week I have no more side effects. I don’t feel as up in mood as with escitalopram but for now it’s ok. Maybe it will improve. It feels very gentle and not so intense in effect as escitalopram.",MG.

47,Vortioxetine,Depression,1.0,,"July 1, 2021",1,"I have been on Mirtazapine (45 mg per day) for depression, anxiety and insomnia (symptoms of my borderline personality disorder) for more than half a year; and my psychiatrist prescribed me this drug as an extra to decrease my re-occurring depressive bouts. I started with the lowest dose (5 mg), but still it cancelled out the sleep-enhancing effect of Mirtazapine from day one. I could not sleep more than 5 hours a night, which made me exhausted and irritable during the day. Therefore, I would definitely not recommend it for those patients who are sensitive to stimulants or who need to take sleep-enhancing medications like Mirtazapine, because it might ruin their sleep, indirectly causing nervous exhaustion, which eventually increases depression, thereby doing the exact opposite to what it is designed to do.",Nigel

I felt constantly sleepy, down, and emotionally blunted with zero libido on Lexapro, Zoloft and other SSRIs. Vortioxetine took longer to have an effect, but once it kicked in at the 3 week mark, I finally felt better. Emotions were normalized and I started feeling much more confident about myself and around other people. It helped my social anxiety in that regard and also made me super motivated and willing to go outside. Interacting with people finally felt easy and natural. I think some of these effects can also be attributed to the previous addition of 300mg bupropion which also raises plasma levels of Brintellix and makes it more effective.",SilverKeith

In the past I tried several other antidepressants with little success. Unfortunately I did not have a good experience with this medication either. During the first month I felt excessively angry and irritable all day. I knew that wasn't like me but I kept taking the medicine because I know the first month can be rough, and I wanted to see the benefits. The medicine also made me feel sick to my stomach sometimes like a sudden wave of nausea. Things went easier after the first month and a half and I stayed on the same strength for another two months. At the three month marker I felt only slightly better in general and noticed the same occasional sharp dips in mood as when I wasn't taking any medicine. The benefits weren't as great as I thought they would be and I had more or less constant stomach/bowel issues, so it wasn't worth it for me.

I did not experience the nausea that so many do, but rather diarrhea, insomnia, loss of appetite, itching, and a marked increase of tinnitus that had been in remission.

I'm considering going back down to 10mg to see if it's dosage related. Will discuss with my doctor. By the way, I take it at night--have no nausea and helps me sleep. And I'm experiencing improvement in brain clarity (no fog).  I really, really, really don't want to stop taking this. Aside from the constipation, no side effects.",jay

After chat with psychiatrist here in France, he suggested Brintellix (BX) saying it had the fewest side effects of the ADs he prescribes. All meds taken in morning. I tapered Effexor to 37.5 mg + 5 mg BX for 1 week, then 18.75 Effexor + 5 mg BX for 1 week, then 9 mg Effexor + 7.5 mg BX for 1 week. Then stopped Effexor and upped to 10 mg BX. Taper period was rough and tiring and I felt the nausea many users complain of. After 1 week feeling like garbage, pharmacist suggested I take a ""probiotic"" (PB). Took PB in morning 30 minutes pre-eating, then ate and took BX. Stomach problems disappeared immediately and after taking PB for 3 weeks, I now use 10 mg BX with 0 stomach issues.

I also noticed my body temperature increasing about an hour after they kick in and I would start to sweat. After about two hours these symptoms pilfer out.. I can't say my thinking has changed, I feel a bit more levelled out, my sex drive is the same and after about three weeks my sleep improved somewhat. They are quite subtle.

Been on vortioxetine about 7 mos. It has improved my depression and helped me feel good and confident.  At first the side effects were some nausea, itchiness and diminished vision. The benefits outweighed the side effects-especially since-unlike regular SSRIs-this med does not interfere with my ability to think clearly and complete my work. Now though I have developed joint pain and muscle stiffness. Also maybe it shrinks my tendons. When I skip med for a day pain/stiffness reduces and vision improves.

Try taking it at night, cutting the dose in half (I'm on 10mg), or taking with food.This is a very new medicine so I hope this helps others in their first couple weeks.",Girlfriend in a Coma

I read the other reviews and I'll share my experience with it.  Like many others, I've taken other anti-depressants (since diagnosed in 1997), which are the following: Prozac, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Zoloft, & Effexor (I STRONGLY urge everyone to think twice before taking Effexor - it's the only anti-depressant that had major, long-term withdrawals and was ineffective as well).  I've also been taking Xanax 3 times a day for 17 years, and it's been a Godsend (not one panic attack since the first day I took it) and has a low impact on the body.I'm interested to see if this is helpful.",AJF

I didn't have much of one before taking it but hoped having a happier mood would help that but scared it made it worse. My dr wants to see me back about doing an increase but worried it will make my already very low sex drive worse unless it makes me feel happier and helps?
