0,Methylphenidate,Depression,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 10, 2022",1,"My doctor told a story while prescribing this medicine for me.  Concerta is like having a picnic.  Ritalin is like a crazy rock party.  I have used many SSRI group drugs for the treatment of depression for many years.  These are Lustral, prozac and others.  However, I think I didn't get exactly what I wanted.  After I started using Ritalin (sometimes I take it. Usually a few days apart.) everything became more colorful for me.  I look around, I feel the urge to work or study, I take risks and I feel good.  Sometimes my neck and arms hurt.  But I'm not sure if it's because of the ritalin.  I enjoy touching it, my sofa, my jacket, my bag.  Touching is more pleasant for me.  In many ways, it's a miracle for me.",Ritalin&Concert
1,Methylphenidate,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 9, 2022",0,"I have suffered from severe depression and anxiety I feel my entire existence. This medication has saved me and I have been put on every antidepressant under the sun (specifically around 14 medications over the last 12 years). I have also been in therapy for over 7 years. This was my last resort. I am currently on methylphenidate SR which has saved my life. I have been taking it for over a month and  I can actually smile genuinely, dare I say laugh?! - I no longer have the 24/7 existential dread of my mortality, waking up with night terrors, panic attacks - gone. No side effects for me besides a suppressed appetite. Don’t worry, I eat plenty :) Definitely something to look into and at least talk to your doctor if nothing else has done the trick. (Side note - beware of the KVK Tech methylphenidate yellow tablets. I didn’t think to look up how many other people had severe side effects or issues like I did until I read this form. So thank you for that reassurance that I wasn’t going crazy! )",Tess
2,Methylphenidate,Depression,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 3, 2022",1,"I have ADHD and have been on methylphenidate for over 10 years. I can say (IMO) taking stimulants like methylphenidate mono-therapy can help in the beginning but tolerance and addiction can be a problem. Also, having to up the dose frequently will not help you feel good. I know some people have depression from their adhd/add so a stimulant may help but IMO stimulants like methylphenidate should be used as antidepressant add-ons in lower dosages to augment antidepressant response. AD+stimulant may be helpful and I've seen it used before but stimulant mono-therapy is risky IMO when we are referring to depression treatment. Once again just my opinion",ColdWhiteNorth

My mood is good, energy is up and I feel so much better.  I take 20mg twice per day.   So if you suffer from depression ask your doctor about adding Methylphenidate to your daily routine.

Within an hour of trying methylphenidate, the lights came on.  I do not need an MAOI, nor do I need to die to escape the nightmare I found myself living in anymore.  I am putting my life together for the first time in close to a decade.  Truly a miracle medication if it works with your chemistry and virtually NO side effects for me.",jstanothareviewah

I've been depressed for ages and I tried this. I have tried tons of antidepressants. I still on prozac and lamictal. Methylphenidate has made as big an impact as those two. It allows me to feel more connected, interested, calm and stable. I take 5mg three times a day but I may increase. It sometimes gives me nausea, headaches and fatigue but the pros outweigh the cons (I do take the cheapest generic) .of you've tried the more conventional treatments, gives this a go.

10,Methylphenidate,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 8, 2019",58,"I have bipolar disorder and ADHD. I was put on this medication to treat the ADHD, but I’ve noticed a significant difference in my depressive episodes when I take Ritalin. Before, when I experienced my lows, I wouldn’t be able to get out of bed, I couldn’t concentrate, my mind was foggy, I’d binge eat, put things off, and was miserable 24/7. Ritalin helps me focus, complete tasks, start my day, eat properly, and minimizes the depressive emotions in general. As of five months on the medication, I’ve watched it successfully treat the ADHD and fight back depression symptoms. I just want to clarify it doesn’t get rid of depression, but it does make it manageable. I am under the care of a psychiatrist, and we are monitoring the effects of Ritalin on both my ADHD and mood swings.",Mack

I have had 3 major episodes where I had to take a LOA from work for 4 months while the Psychiatrist tried every medication cocktail. Finally Abilify brought me back to life the first time. The next episode was Methylphenidate was ineffective but I don’t think I have it a chance. The third episode was 2 years ago and Methylphenidate gave me my joy and allowed me to engage in life again. I am worried about the long term effects of being on this drug as it is going on 3 years. It has become less effective with time.

I am able to focus on an issue, task or problem and deal with it appropriately. Whereas off the med I would get overwhelmed and start becoming stressed.

But what it does for my depression is worth it. I know others who use it for the same.",D3n2n6m0c6v1
50,Methylphenidate,Depression,10.0,,"October 4, 2014",133,I have suffered from severe depression most of my life (I am 58) 20 yrs ago I was put on Ritalin.  It changed my outlook and life virtually overnight.  In these 20 years I also took a variety of antidepressants.  None very effective.  Psychotherapy and Ritalin were together the cornerstone of my care and made a normal life possible.,FET
51,Methylphenidate,Depression,9.0,,"August 3, 2014",91,"I have been on numerous antidepressants that seem to wear out over time.  I last had this experience with paroxetine.  My doctor suggested Ritalin as an aid to make the paroxetine work better.  What a world of difference!  There's not much information out there about this, and I am sure there must be downsides.   This works for me like nothing else.  I am very careful with it, but I feel there are more upsides than otherwise.",Johnnie2

53,Methylphenidate,Depression,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 5, 2014",56,"I was diagnosed with ADD (later ammended to anxiety/depression) at university and went through the gamut of drugs (ritalin, dexedrine, effexor, paxil, zoloft, prozac) alone and combined. I hated the wait time for the meds to work and hated the wait time for the horrible side effects to wear off. I had nausea, insomnia, extreme weight loss, extreme sweating, blurry vision to name a few. Later a psychotherapist suggested ritalin and clonazepam used together and it changed my life. I could concentrate during the day and sleep at night. In Canada I could only get a psychiatrist to prescribe this for me. Doctors wouldn't do it warning of the possibilities of abuse, etc. Doctors here push the newer drugs but I found these worked great!!",missmarple

I currently take 10mg Methylin ER and 150mg bupropion XL in the morning. In the evenings I take 50mg of trazadone for sleep.3 weeks now and I have never felt better. The adjustment period was pretty mild. Just a bit 'jazzed' in the morning and very mild nausea in the evening. This gradually faded over a week. My appetite is returning, my diet improving and I am reconnecting socially.My sleep is good and I awaken fully alert with the sunrise.I can't believe how dramatic this change is. I am optimistic that I will be able to dig myself out of the hole I've been in and re-build a life.",meyotch

I no longer have a billion things racing in my head, like you need to do this and that and never following through on anything! I used to do crafts, such as sew, crochet, work in the yard, etc. I can finally do that again!

They say it has a lot to do with my mind, has so many thoughts of what happened, what is happening, etc. racing through it that I guess it basically just gets worn out like exercising but once they started Ritalin 20 mg three times a day it helped a lot. More focused, less worried and in time just felt more rested and calm. But did have to force to eat at first. Lost my appetite until I got used to it.",Maximus409

I am now able to make goals and follow through with them, my mood is more stable, I look forward to waking up in the morning again and it doesn't affect my appetite too much. You do need to make sure you find your dose for optimal results.

I don't sleep for 12 hours or more anymore either. I can wake fully rested with 8 hours sleep and do anything my heart desires.
