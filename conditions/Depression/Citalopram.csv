0,Citalopram,Depression,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 7, 2022",0,"I love citalopram, it gives me the boost that I need to get trough the day. It is actually funny, because now, people tell me that I am ''always in a good mood'', ''always calm'' and ''always smiling''. I'm not gonna lie, I fake it sometimes and I really try my best to be a nice person to be around, especially at work,  but it's feels so good to know that I am truly the only one who know about my deep chronic depression. PS. I have dysthymia.",Sofia_lala

3,Citalopram,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 11, 2022",1,"I  have been taking Citalopram for  just over a year. I take it for anxiety and depression.  I started on  10 mg.  I had very mild side effects.This starting dose did  help with me with sleeping and  anxiety but only a little bit with depression. My dose was increased to 20mg, which did improve my symptoms. After about 6 months I  started to feel  flat and lacking in energy.  The dose was increase to 30mg for a month trial , which did help, but reduced  back to 20mg partly as I   wary of increasing the dose. I recently saw my doctor for  a review.  I  was still feeling very flat &  low energy.  I'm in the process of increasing to 40mg over a couple of weeks. I  can't believe how much better I  feel. Heaps more energy, feeling really good  -  I  hope it continues.  We discussed the 40 mg dose as this is the max dose - no side effects so far",Dibby

It was like a weighted blanket for my brain, helped me stay focused with uni reading and I stopped spiralling. Only side effect was drowsiness so I downloaded a sleeping app and kept to a schedule to try and reduce sleepiness in the day.Do not let yourself go into withdrawal without slowly lowering your dose, it’s so not worth it.Also, don’t take it with NSAIDs. I did this when my toe broke, I maybe took them together for a week or two. After two months on PPIs and a GI diet, my stomach still hasn’t fully healed from the damage it did. I can’t drink alcohol or eat half of the food in my cupboard anymore because my stomach lining got so messed up. This won’t happen to everyone but please keep safe. I would recommend keeping a close eye on your gut and heart health. If you get any signs of arrhythmia or if you see black stools tell your doctor immediately.",uglyduckling23

I didn't seek help back then because of mental stigma. After spending 9 years active service I finally seek help but by seeking help I also ended my military career. My goal back then is to retire in the service, serve my country but I only served less than 10 years. I got out in 1995. I was prescribed different medications,  nothing helps until I was prescribed citalopram. This medication helps me with some of my symptoms.  It helps me to feel less anxious, less racing thoughts, overthinking and less worrying especially at nights.  The biggest outcome I gain with this medication is feeling numb but I rather  have that than going through what I've been through for so many years.

Took things in my stride.I will say however that although it does alleviate symptoms of depression it also makes you very unmotivated in terms of your goals and life achievements. It made me content with just getting myself to work and then relaxing and sleeping the rest of the time.I would say this would do wonders for somebody a bit older and more contented in life.

I've struggle with depression and anxiety since I was very young - I was diagnosed with tourettes syndrome as a child and developed anxiety surrounding it as I'm very self conscious.After my second child was born I had severe post partum depression and within a few weeks I began to see colour vividly...I noticed mountains I swear I never noticed before.  I could almost look at stressful situations that were once triggers for me from an outside perspective being able to remain calm and make a rational decision or action.I have tried to wean off twice since then but my brain truly needs the balance citalopram provides and I'm seriously grateful for its existence.

I also nearly ended up in the pysch ward because of panic attacks and also felt very suicidal a few times on this medicine.  Every day I monitored my progress and the anxiety and  panic attacks lessened considerably yes! at week 4-5 felt Zombie like (numb). Week 8 I was having even less anxiety but still one excruciating panic attack. I went back to the doctor and was prescribed  40mgs of Citalopam  that was such a good week!

33,Citalopram,Depression,10.0,,"July 28, 2021",3,"When I was 38 I suffered a breakdown from a long term relationship break up. I had  electric currents running through my body all the time, heavy sweating, mind dullness, no interest in anything or appetite, constant white noise and chest ache.  When I woke up each day I couldn't stop sobbing, I  didn't want to be alive as the pain was too much. Sometimes I'd break down unexpectedly howling with pain and depression. My doctor put me on 30mg citalopram. It didn't seem to make much difference but over weeks and months it did stop me from thinking of suicide and I started being able to do basic things and eventually I calmed down.I'm still on it and I'm now 51! I've tried coming off it over the years but the doctor said some people have a deficiency in some chemical that Citalopram makes up for.

I take mine at night now which actually means I can sleep.This hasn’t affected me sexually or decreased my libido. If anything it’s increased it . For the first time I feel actually happy and content with my life  If you are considering this medication I say do it. It’s been life changing for me. I suffered with agoraphobia and a severe sense of worthlessness, depression and suicidal thoughts . This medication combined with talking therapy has changed my life. Any side effects will go away after a few weeks. I also recommend taking this medication alongside therapy as really a combination of both it IMO the only sure fire way to start feeling yourself again .",Wednesday

I realize now that I have been suffering from at least mild depression and anxiety for years. I don’t remember feeling normal like this ever. I believe I would have been a much better husband and father all of these years if I would have dealt with this earlier.  It’s like the first time when I wore prescription lenses.  I didn’t realize how bad my vision was until I could see clearly.  I feel the same about what Celexa has done for my mood.

My depression has always been situational, meaning situations I found myself in that I could not easily escape. One such situation was my brother's own Schizophrenia, and its corresponding symptoms. Being exposed to his episodes & not having good coping mechanisms led to my first episode of depression. I have COVID to thank for the second one. The great news! Citalopram pulled me out each time, although the second time took a handful of weeks longer for it to work. This helped me to feel completely normal again, instead of constantly feeling like everything is pointless. I decided to right this review because it basically got rid of my depression, TWICE!

39,Citalopram,Depression,1.0,,"April 9, 2021",6,"I took this for 2 months and to say I had suicidal thoughts is an understatement.  I became obsessed with suicide.  I think why I didn't realize it was the citalopram at first is because when I first started taking it, I thought it was helping, but I think as it built up into my system, it had the opposite affect on me.  I had never been on an anti-depressant, so I knew it was situational depression, but I didn't catch that it was the medication that was making me worse.  I thought some sort of past trauma must be triggered.  I had never felt so emotionally horrible.  Life was a struggle every minute of everyday.  I didn't understand ""suicidal thoughts"" were also severe ""suicidal feeling of emotional pain"". I know this medication works for some but if someone is reading this and you are in a different kind of emotional pain that you have never been in, stop taking it.  if you start thinking or feeling like suicide at all.... please  tell someone and quit this medication or any other medication immediately.",Foot06ball

Now with citalopram they are less frequent and when they do happen are less bothersome to me.I previously would self harm. Whilst the impulses to SH have been there, the frequency and severity have been less. Usually I have a very difficult period at the start of the year and whilst I have been very anxious and low in mood at times, I feel it has been more manageable this year than previous, before medication.

I started citalopram after a few months on generic escitalopram 20 mg/day which I had trouble tolerating due to bathroom issues.    I have to say so far, so good for the citalopram.  I am somewhat calmer, less depressed and have fewer intrusive thoughts and I'm not spending so much time in the bathroom.  The first few days of citalopram, I had some mild agitation, but that seems to be gone now.  Otherwise, virtually no side effects.   I think this is working for me and I intend to call my psych-doc and tell her the good news.  In the interest of full disclosure, I also take 45 mg/day Mirtazapine and anywhere between .5 and 1.0 mg lorazepam/day.  I've been on Mirtazapine for almost 10 years and on a very low dose of various benzos off and on for about 40 years.

I was able to get to 40 mg and had no issues with sex drive. I was able to cope with a sexual trauma, attend community college, even helped me get my first job. And I was still able to enjoy alcohol as well. Only reason my GP changed my meds to 20 mg lexapro is he claimed it was more effective. Well why fix something that isn’t broken. I was on lexapro 20 mg until recently it pooped out due to the increase in anxiety from covid, work and suicidal thoughts returning. I am now on day 4 of celexa and still have anxiety and loss of appetite. Then again the first week can be the most difficult when starting an antidepressant. I’m on 10 mg and gradually decreasing the Trintellix. Hopefully I see improvement by Tuesday when I increase to 20 mg celexa. It may be more effective this time since I have a toolbox of coping skills I didn’t have 7 years ago (yoga, hiking, meditation, therapy).",Dmccuddles27

I'm not euphoric all the time, it is not a happy pill, rather I have just returned to a familiar state that I had lost touch with. Social skills are the best they have been in years. Previously I was scared to go outside and would stay locked in my room for days on end, I now relish every opportunity to get out and interact with other humans; something I had always loved but lost touch with as things deteriorated.Everyone's experience is different, but Citalopram has worked well for me. I still feel emotions, I still get sad or upset or nervous, but I also laugh until my belly hurts and get real joy from everyday interactions. This is a massive change from where I was at, which was cut off, terrified, constantly ruminating, and experiencing severe anhedonia.

It really helped my depression but I had reduce, as I began to feel a bit numb emotionally. After those 3 months of feeling good again, I came off (albeit too quickly and in a bad way) and had the worst withdrawal: brain zaps, stomach ache, terrible depression and anxiety etc. I reinstated the 10mg dose 3 weeks later. However, this was ineffective and I was still very depressed, and upping to 20mg just made me feel numb and like I didn't care about anything.

After a major MVA, I suffered several injuries, and was in constant pain for almost two years. The pain and inability to move due to a spinal injury caused me to fall into a deep depression. I'd suffered with anxiety most of my life, but found alternative methods of coping. I typically make 15k or better steps a night during my ER shifts, so to suddenly be unable to move, I was floored! My neurologist recommended I try an SSRI  (Celexa) temporarily to help with my being depressed, and I reluctantly agreed. I was adamant about not taking SSRI's as I don't like anything fooling around in my brain. But it worked. I had minimal side effects, and even they eventually subsided within the first month of use.

It's really important not to rely just on medication though, it's definitely only worked together with therapist/changing a few things (way I communicate etc). A huge downside to begin with was how tired I was, I would take the meds at night and then not be able to wake up properly, would easily fall back asleep until lunchtime. I now take them around 2pm. I experimented a lot with the timings! This seems best for me as I'm usually out/busy in the afternoons so don't get caught tired.",jkjkjkjkjk

After 2 years, I think it stopped working because I would be crying and miss work all of the time, for no great reason.  I then tried Wellbutrin, this did basically nothing for me.  I got very discouraged at the way I was feeling, and started self medicating with the wrong things.  I began Citalopram/Celexa 40mg/day.  It honestly took about a year to work well.  I don't know if it is the meds or my age (I am now 34), but life is WAY better.  My motivation still sucks, but that's just life.",KC81

339,Citalopram,Depression,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 6, 2015",43,"Whilst I have always had a tendency towards low moods I had my first bout of real depression at the start of this summer. Until then I didn't know what depression was and how utterly hopeless and cruel an illness it is. I honestly longed for death everyday. I had been suffering with it for varying degrees for a few months when After a week of not being able to get out of bed to go to work,  I finally went to the doctor (with my mothers encouragement) 3 weeks ago and was put on Citalopram. I can honestly say that it has been and is at the moment a real life saver for me. It doesn't make me 'happy' (nor do I care - anyone with depression will no you'll settle for not depressed), what it does is take away the desperation and as others have said helps  me to cope. It makes me want to do things to improve my mood, and gives me the ability to get out of bed in the morning. It just makes me feel a bit more like my old self. Re side effects, I have put on weight on it but I had lost so much whilst depressed I think I'm just putting my old weight back on, as I now have an appetite again. The worst side effect for me is sleeping - for the first week I had dreadful insomnia and I am still waking up around 4 every night. The side effects are small fry compared to the difference it's made.  It's by no means perfect but it's got me on the road to recovery and given me the ability to do cbt, meditation and just look after myself and actually enjoy life again. I hope anyone reading this for depression gets help in some way or another for this awful illness. Remember- it won't rain forever. X",Christie30
