0,Viibryd,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 10, 2022",0,"After 6 weeks I can say Viibryd is not for me. I had been on Lexapro for about 5 years, and I just felt like it pooped out on me for lack of a better term. I felt like a zombie, not engaging in life, and just going through the motions. My psych thought Viibryd would work well for me, and I had really high hopes. I started very low, taking 5mg for 5 days as I was weaning off Lexapro, then 10mg for 10 days, then up to 20mg. The last week (week 3 on 20mg) has been one of the worst weeks of my life. Unrelenting, paralyzing anxiety, inability to focus due to cycling existential dread, and suicidal ideation. I have been having awful, vivid dreams since I started, along with night sweats that wake me out of a dead sleep. The fact is, I feel far, far worse now than I did before I started Viibryd over a month ago. My psych agreed that going off this NOW is best. I'm so happy this drug has worked so well for others, but it just wasn't for me.",HelloManda
1,Viibryd,Depression,4.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 19, 2022",0,"Been on this for about 6 months now, after being on Lexapro 20-30mg for 18 yrs. I think my mood overall is slightly better now.  However, I’ve been having nausea on almost a daily basis. Have had several episodes of vomiting. I’ve been blaming the GI stuff on a recurrent ulcer, but I only had actual stomach pain when I attempted to take ibuprofen.  Now concerned the culprit might actually be Viibryd.I don’t really want to try another medicine if I don’t have to. I’m a surgical PA and it’s extremely difficult to be messing with my meds when I need to focus 10 hrs a day.  Anyone have a similar experience?  Suggestions?",Miss Kelly
2,Viibryd,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 31, 2022",1,"I asperger's syndrome (autism) and have tried different SSRI/SNRI drugs in the past for anxiety and depression. Couldn't tolerate any of them. They all made my sensory overload go crazy and I couldn't sleep. Finally we tried Viibryd and within a couple of weeks my crying spells during the day had stopped and my general anxiety level had gone down quite a bit from being at a lifetime high of extremely severe. It did all of this with almost no side effects whatsoever. The only thing I noticed getting onto it was that I felt just a tad ""odd"" the first two days, but it was easy to dismiss unlike the other antidepressants that made me feel like living nightmare. I also held out hope that it would help my OCD, which I've had fairly severely since 8-9 years of age.3+ months and I think the Viibryd may be making me feel TOO good. I have have more energy but I think some of it is manifesting as OCD and lately my OCD has been noticeably worse. Now looking into Seroquel to add to the Viibryd.",berberry

5,Viibryd,Depression,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 8, 2021",2,"Viibryd seemed to be a good antidepressant, was effective, however I developed severe migraines and high blood pressure. I had to go off of it.",Jillpp
6,Viibryd,Depression,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 11, 2021",4,"Switched to Viibryd after Sertraline stopped working for me. Viibryd was the first antidepressant that I could actually feel working to alleviate my depression about 2 weeks into therapy. It continued working for 7 years until I had to change to another medication as Viibryd never received approval from the EMA for use in Europe.While the drug was very effective for me I do fault the manufacture for cutting corners simply due to greed. For instance, the manufacturer never made the medication available in a single 30 mg dose even though it was the appropriate dose for many patients. Since Viibryd pills should not be cut the only way to get a 30 mg dose is through two separate prescriptions: one for 20 mg and one for 10 mg. Many insurance companies will not cover the cost of two prescriptions for the same drug. A full 10 years after introduction there is no generic version of Viibryd.",Rathmullan
7,Viibryd,Depression,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 6, 2021",2,I've read all the reviews and feel so alone with my side effects. I can't stop clenching my jaw. To the point that I don't realize I'm doing it. Only to stop and automatically realize I'm doing in again. My jaw is hurting so bad. The other bad one is shivering. Feel like I'm super nervous very shaky. Especially in the am I wake up like this everyday. Like tremors. Yes had diarrhea & nausea first week of 10 mg but I hung in there. Now I'm on 20mg and even tho that part is better the first 2 I mentioned are worse. Think I'll go back to 10mg if this doesn't stop. I've tried everything for my depression.  Felt l share my side effects since no one mentioned them. I take it at 6pm with dinner cause makes me sleepy. I dream more but no terrors or sleep paralysis. At this point I just feel like I'm on SED. not in a good way. Gonna go back to 10mg and praying for better results. Good luck to everyone. I know how hard it is to find the one that works for you.,Anonymous
8,Viibryd,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 31, 2021",4,"I've been on the most popular SSRIs and SNRI's for over 30 years. My Dr. wanted me to try Viibryd and at 20mg. I felt pretty good. However, after approx. 8 weeks, I noticed redness, rashes, blotches, acne and rosacea on my face. I stopped taking it and went back to Lexapro (brand). I've always been prone to psoriasis and eczema, but only in small patches on elbows and knees. I never had any problems on my face with these mild conditions. Well, Viibryd set off an explosion of skin irritations on my face. When I stopped taking it, my face started to heal with medications by a dermatologist. However, it's now six months later, and I still have red patches, irritations, capillaries showing on nose, scars, discoloring, etc. The company called me about my concerns, but I never heard back. Dr.'s should warn everyone prone to skin conditions about the risks. This is by far the WORST antidepressant I've taken and have the scars on my nose to prove it.",Bob_FL
9,Viibryd,Depression,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 5, 2021",2,"I've been on Viibryd for depression/anxiety/panic attacks for almost 6 weeks (started on 10mg for 2 weeks then went up to 20mg). So far my experience has been good. Every week I slowly noticed myself feeling a little better. Now, looking back, I used to have multiple panic attacks a day and now I have maybe a few a week tops. My goal is to have less than this but this is still a big improvement for me! My depression is also not 100% but it is a lot better. I've tried multiple medications and this one is the best with the least side effects. The only side effects I noticed were increased anxiety at the beginning which went away after a few days. I also had insomnia in the beginning which seems to have gotten a lot better. No weight gain or low sex drive. Life isn't sunshine and rainbows on Viibryd. I still have hard days and I still get anxious but I feel like the medicine is doing what it is supposed to do! I'll definitely be staying on it and continuing to do therapy self care.",Anonymous
10,Viibryd,Depression,1.0,,"September 24, 2021",2,"I took my first 10mg dose of Viibryd 7 hours ago with food and I feel so nauseous. I have diarrhea and a bad headache. I woke from my nap feeling starved with restless legs. I need to eat but am too nauseous. I also feel tight in my chest as if I've taken an Adderall causing my anxiety to spike and my jaw feels tight. This is a very powerful medication & I hope these side effects go away because I DO feel more energy, as I've been depressed for years.",Riah

I’ve taken Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Prozac.  Over a long time. Viibryd made me feel very anxious! I kept telling my Therapist but she wasn’t very helpful. I was so scatterbrained!  I locked myself out of my house and got up onto my gate get into a window and fell had to go to the Emergency. I thought I had asthma because I was having a hard time breathing! My allergist put me on a  inhaler. I also had another trip to the Emergency room, I drove myself because I couldn’t breathe!  I had to use my Epipen. All because I was having a bad reaction to this antidepressant Viibryd! It also messed with my sense of direction. I stopped taking this medication and thank God I figured it all out. My therapist wouldn’t listen to me. As soon as I went off this I was fine! Dosage was 60mg, I believe I was on it for 6 mo. I was 62 yrs of age. Be Careful taking any antidepressant.",Sheri

Thought I was dying, felt like I was leaving my body, could not speak except gibberish, felt no control of myself. Felt like an anxiety attack x 100. Had to be driven to the ER.

14,Viibryd,Depression,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 5, 2021",2,"I'm on this for Bipolar IIThree week review:Fabulous medication. Zero irritability, great impact on depression, no anxiety, clear mind, good judgement in life events, no side effects at all. Lots of energy! Past RXs:I tried lamictal, lexapro, celexa, Wellbutrin, buspar, and others without success. Lexapro and Wellbutrin made me irritable. Lamictal and celexa got rid my sex drive and lowered my testosterone to a 70 years old level. Likely upgrade:I may consider upgrading 20mgs to 40mgs, since I see minor (very minor) signs on depression.Overall:Very positive first impression in the first month with absolutely ZERO side effects. Positive effects:Lots and lots of energy. Libido is back.Lost belly fat caused by lexapro (prior med)I go to the gym very often, and I have seen a reduction in body fat.

I was unable to sleep with assistance on this medication and so after 11 weeks I decided it wasn't for me and it was time to stop.  I'm taking a number of different medications in order to help me sleep but I would wake up at 2am every night and then toss and turn.  In the beginning I couldn't sleep at all and it was frightening and very scary.  The other big issue was from the first dose I was not able to get an erection.  So sleep and ED and at 20mg not controlling anxiety.  I was put on Klonopin (as a rescue) to help with sleep and anxiety and I'm now off the drug and going back to Paxil, which allows me to sleep through the night and get an erection.",MD
17,Viibryd,Depression,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 24, 2021",28,I started at 10 mg and I am now currently on 20 mg. I have to say that previously before this I was on trinellax which worked but got off because of side effects and then switched to lexapro which was horrible!!. Now I am on this medication. This medication gave me the push I needed to build a place in my head to were I feel so mentally stable and independent. Rather than thinking that everyone is judging and that you’re not good enough for anything. This really gave me what I was looking for in the sense of clearing all brain fog and allowed me to think straight. Highly recommend start at low doses. Start to feel a change in about 3 weeks,TD
18,Viibryd,Depression,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 18, 2021",12,I have been on antidepressants for 30 years.  Viibryd is the worst experience I’ve ever had to go through.  I took 10mg the first week then 20 mg.  My anxiety was so bad I was climbing out of my skin.  I couldn’t sleep & this medication triggered my hot flashes like never before.  I only took it for 3 weeks & I had to just stop cold turkey.  My withdrawals cannot possibly be as bad as taking this drug.  After starting Viibryd I’m dealing with insomnia.  The Trazadone I took for sleep worked like a charm until I took Viibryd,Dewey

20,Viibryd,Depression,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 25, 2021",9,I took Viibryd for a few years and had good results. I’ve taken anti depressants since the early1970’s. Everything from Elavil to Wellbutrin and trazodone. I decided early in the COVID period to try going off my Viibryd. After a few weeks I found that I was crying at any and everything. As a matter of fact I would find tears running down my face over nothing. I have a very supportive husband and really nothing to cause this crying. I am back on my Viibryd and no longer cry over nothing. I have no I'll side effects from the Viibryd. I am sorry so many have bad side effects. This drug has made my life better.,Missnola
21,Viibryd,Depression,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 25, 2021",3,"I can not say enough good things about this drug. It made me ""me"" again. I have tried many drugs over the years to try to deal with anxiety and depression and either the meds made things worse, didn't work at all, or the side effects were worse than the actual problem. I tried for years to deal with no meds at all then when things were getting to a boiling point and not really having a doctor listen to me, I did my own research and requested to be put on Viibryd. My anxiety is almost nonexistent now. I feel better than I have in years. The only side effect I have been experiencing is stomach upsets and diarrhea but that has also gotten better with time. I take 20mg once a day and am beyond thankful I have found this drug. I have been on it now 6 months, no weight gain, no sexual side effects at all.",Blahblahblah

Sleeping pills that normally could put me to sleep - trazodone, ambien - didn't work for me at all.The worst thing is that now, almost one month after stopping the medication, my insomnia is still very bad. On some nights I can go to sleep with trazodone. On other nights I can't fall asleep even after 10 mg ambien. I feel that Viibryd somehow totally destroyed my sleep / wake cycle.Surprisingly, the only thing that work for me are herbal supplements: valerian root and CBD. But they leave me very groggy next day. Viibryd is probably the worst medication I ever tried.",Iscander
23,Viibryd,Depression,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2021",12,I’ve been on Viibryd for going on 8 days for my major depression and besides the nausea that comes in waves I’ve noticed I’m not staying in bed all day like before. The doctor says there is no way I can feel anything yet because I haven’t been taking it long enough well something is changing. I no longer go back to bed while my kids are home. Instead I awake and find myself doing things without the tired withdrawn feeling. I even take a sleep aid at night and I can still get up and go about my day. This Viibryd must be working for I’ve tried dozens of meds and nothing. I hope the nausea fades but truly I’ll deal with it if it means I’m not suffering crippling sadness.,Just sad me

Based upon other reviewers, and my own experience, I feel that something is inherently ""wrong"" with Viibryd.  I may have noticed a slight elevation of my mood when I began taking it; but over time,  the side effects such as nausea, indigestion, and a general feeling of malaise gradually took center stage.  I finally tapered off and discontinued usage, and I feel sooo much better now!  In hindsight, I had been feeling miserable for about 4 or 5 months!  For reference, I am 55 yrs. old, active, 150 lbs, bipolar II with depression, and take Trazadone, Buspar, and Lamictal.

I had almost given up taking medications because I felt like I had taken everything there was to offer. After taking a gene test, my psychiatrist wanted me to try this. I almost immediately noticed more energy, I had hope again and could enjoy the things I normally would. However, the nausea was unbearable. Within 6 months I had lost almost 60 lbs because everything I ate, I would throw up.

I’d like to start by saying that the reviews on this forum have been really helpful for me, as I’ve been trying different meds for months. With that being said, Viibryd did not work well for me. I started on 20mg x2 weeks, then increased to 40mg, while titrating down off of Zoloft (that will be a whole different review).The nausea was unreal! I saw a naturopath who prescribed some supplements, so for a week or so I felt great. But, I started noticing that I would get super angry and depressed. So, my dr said we can cut back down to 20mg and see how it does. No improvement. One thing that was consistent with Viibryd was the nausea. I vomited every morning the entire time I took it. So,I’m switching to Paxil. So far, I’ve gone 4 days without vomiting. It’s such a relief. Medication works differently for everyone, but it helps to know that you’re not alone with any of the side effects. I give Viibryd a big thumbs down",ZestyV

When I first started Viibryd I was extremely irritable and constantly crying. I stuck it out for a while (at the time I was too depressed to go to the doctor to fix it) and it ended up getting a lot better. The side effects went away and I was okay. I’ve been on Viibryd for about 2 years now and I would say the worst side effect is the sleep issues. I work third shift and I generally take it in the morning (around 7:30am) when I get home from work. If I don’t take it around that time on my days off, I feel like I’m in a coma and can’t get up. I’m like sleeping, but aware. And I feel like I’m constantly trying to drag myself out of bed and it takes several tries before I feel that my mind is strong enough. Then when I get up and take it, I have a headache almost all day. If I take it at the exact time daily, it’s a pretty good drug. I hope all this makes sense!",Neonurse12

I no longer felt depressed or hopeless but I was tired all the time with little energy to do anything. After 6+ months I went on Wellbutrin few days and was paranoid and on edge! I was put on Viibryd 10 mg for 1 week and 20 mg after that once per day. Initially the side effects were nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, drowsiness, and headaches. I stuck it out for 2 weeks like that. I began taking my meds at night instead of am, initial side effects went away and I was able to sleep well, eat normal, and had energy to do things that I enjoyed. My focus and mood improved so much my husband noticed instantly. This is one of the meds with least sexual side effects, I was still able to continue with my sex life with few issues. make sure to take your meds on time, a missed dose will quickly cause withdrawal symptoms like nausea, headaches, and irritability.",Marie H.

I have never been able to stop picking my skin even if nothing was there and on this I have. My depression is managed. Anxiety is a different beast but also somewhat okay with the other med combo.

Was on Wellbutrin for many years before my hysterectomy. After my hysterectomy, I fell into a very deep depression, even when on my Wellbutrin. I couldn't get out of bed, slept all the time, was withdrawn, etc. My doctor started me in 10 mg Viibryd for 2 weeks then we moved up to 20 mg. At 20mg dose I was so sleepy so we kept it at 10 mg. I feel like a new person!! I'm stable, level, happy, can handle situations calmly... it literally saved my life. My sex drive seems to have gone down dramatically, but I will try to deal with that the best I can.

When I upped my dose (I think from 10mg to 20mg?) I started to feel really good, like at peace with myself and the world around me for maybe the first time ever.  It was awesome.  I thought I had found the answer but things went downhill by week 3.  I developed a sexual dysfunction that got continually worse (libido in tact, but unable to achieve orgasm; beyond frustrating).  That was followed by a zombie-like effect that became the new me.  I felt like I was an avatar walking through my life controlled by the real me who was a few blocks over having a panic attack that didn't matter because nothing did and that was fine by me.  By the end of the fifth week, a friend who is experienced with SSRIs took me aside and had an intervention:  it's not supposed to be like this, get on something else.  I'm now on Trintellex; much lighter, much better for me.",cali999

My doctor pushed for me to start this medication because my Prozac wasn’t working as effectively and it was the worst decision I ever made. I was on the medication for about 4 months before I weaned myself off of it because of how severe the side effects were. It was four months of pure torture. My short term memory was gone, which was so scary because I couldn’t even retrace my steps one day when I misplaced my keys ten minutes prior. I had terrible diarrhea, agitation, and started to get what felt like brain zaps. I also felt like I had severe brain fog if I didn’t take my dose on time and wasn’t able to concentrate or think properly. I also developed a fear of dying which was extremely strange because I have never experienced anything like that before. The memory loss was the last straw for me because of how bad it was getting.

The medication by itself seemed to work as a normal SSRI, but if my next dose isn’t within the 24 hour period, I wake up with horrible lightening brain that has escalated in to what I can only describe as what feels like a hose in my brain with a hole in it; pulsing every couple of seconds as if there is a leak. Then the itching. It starts at my nose, then onto my eyes, ears and progressively all over my body. I get vivid nightmares and feel hazy, almost unable to discern what is reality and what is in my mind. I am currently 4 days into withdrawal due to the medication not being covered by insurance ($825 WITH a GoodRX coupon), and trying to self-wean.

I am currently weaning off of it slowly and I am really struggling.  I'm down to 20 and scared of what's to come next week when I go down to 10.  It's like an out of body experience.

Some diarrhea at first but that has subsided. In fact, I no longer have to take ANYTHING for constipation. The most amazing and immediate different was I got off the scale and stopped weighing incessantly. I still do so a bit obsessively and compulsively but it comes and goes and is definitely better.

By about the 3 month mark, I was feeling more normal than I have in years. I know this medication is not for everyone but it worked for me.

Viibryd gave me the most vibrant detailed unbelievable dreams, nightmares, sleep paralysis, and visions I've ever experienced. My brain was wired.

In all the anti depressants (prozac,  etc.) I've taken I have never experienced this side effect. The article stated if you restart the dose the itching should stop.

Before drug I had crying that was very hard to control and felt like trash. Major social anhedonia. I felt like a tortured husk of myself. Doc gave me Viibryd. First week it made me nauseous like no other drug I've tried. But it went away. In about a week the social anhedonia started to melt. Another week and the crying went away. Another week and the feeling of impending doom started to subside. But I started to shake and my jaw felt weak. It was messing with my sleep because my jaw felt so shaky and strange. Went to doctor and he gave me Propranolol. It worked. But in between dose I would shake and feel weak. We decided decided to give it another month. After 1 month the shaking and weak feeling did get about 50% better. But then we decided to go to Zoloft. 4 days on Zoloft and the shaking is 99%  gone.

If you drive and are taking this medicine and you start getting sleepy pull over immediately. Number 2; what I would call a powerful, dizzy-ing, electrical, storm that is about to call up the type of storm you would see in a movie that will end the world, inside my skull. Number 3; night terrors that make night terrors look like soft fuzzy kittens. It is also very expensive even with insurance and it's not worth dying over or killing someone else in a car wreck.",K

Viibryd isn't as bad at inhibiting sexual desire as other SSRIs, but it STILL does! For anxiety, this medication wasn't helpful- but I did notice myself in a more positive and upbeat mood (for what that's worth).

337,Viibryd,Depression,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 30, 2013",67,I'm on the second week and I do not feel as sad and anxious. Upset stomach for a couple of days but is wasn't too bad. I was diagnosed with being homozygous for the 1298C MTHFR mutation. Anyone dealing with depression should be tested. The problem with having this mutation is you have a problem with methylation so you can't make enough dopamine and seratonin.  Also you have a problem with norepinephrine and which causes anxiety.  Defects on the 677 /MTHFR gene can cause bipolar and schizophrenia.   To help with methylation need to take Methyl B12 and folate (not folic acid)... people with these defects can't process folic acid. That is why Dr.'s add Deplin to prescribed medicines.  ,nkd1959
