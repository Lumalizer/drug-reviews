0,Rexulti,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 8, 2022",1,"I was put on Rexulti as an add-on to my Depakote for Bipolar type 1 disorder. I had to come off lithium abruptly because it was affecting my sleep and causing me to have suicidal thoughts. My psychiatrist put me back on Depakote (what I had been taking prior to lithium) and then added Rexulti. It has so far been a life changer. I finally feel truly myself in a way I have not felt in years. I must of had high functioning depression for years thinking it was my ""new normal"" but on Rexulti I do not feel so chronically fatigued and I am actually excited about life. I can also think more coherently and clearly and it shows in my academic performance and creativity levels. Give this medication a try if it seems nothing else is working for you because this might!!!",Anonymous
1,Rexulti,Depression,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 16, 2022",1,Have been on Rexulti for 5 yrs. In the beginning it was goodIt made me feel more energetic it wore off. Now I am bored with everything I can’t work out like I did  - for 45 yrs I worked out. It is either giving me muscle weakness or just too bored to do it and you can’t get drunk if you wanted to. I thought it helped my ADD with thinking more clearly it still helps with that. I hope it helps other people.,Donna maria
2,Rexulti,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 22, 2021",4,Bipolar Disorder (type 2 with rapid cycling and mixed episodes too)...this has changed my life! And I’m the type that had many bad experiences and then just tried natural healing for a couple years. I gave up on meds completely. But then I found out it’s the mood stabilizers that were making me sick. Rexulti works wonders for my hypomania! Don’t give up to all those reading this. ❤️I am also on escitalopram for depression and anxiety.,WildRose
3,Rexulti,Depression,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 14, 2021",3,"I took Rexulti for almost 2 years for depression. I had tried many different medications, and it was the one medication that I responded to at the time. I started out on 0.5mg and slowly increased my dosage to 2mg. It worked for a while, but then stopped working. It also made me feel flat and sedated. My doctor added a stimulant (Adderall) to counteract the sedation which only helped a little. We tried adding on other antidepressants, with not much response. Any time I started a new antidepressant, I would feel more sedated (now I realize it was a drug interaction with the Rexulti).  Finally, I decided to wean myself off of Rexuli and the fog has finally lifted. I realize a lot of my fatigue that I was attributing to my depression was actually the Rexulti. I feel like I lost 2 years of my life!  And I feel like I made a lot of poor decisions on this medication.  Be careful if you are taking this medication.",AJ63
4,Rexulti,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 27, 2021",3,"Rexulti is the 6th AD that I had taken over 13 years. It's also the first one to work. Hands down 10/10.The first 5 ADs provided minimal help and maximum side effects (fatigue, weight gain, insomnia, long-term IBS etc ). In general, they moved serious depression and anxiety to moderate, but at an unsustainable cost. Rexulti is entirely different. Within 1 day, I noticed a big difference, in 3 days, I was me. For the first time in 13 years.  My depression is in remission, my anxiety is around 20% of what it was. Huge win, and more to come. I think I need time for pathways & habits to rewire. Side effects: weight gain but not a lot. Perhaps some sleep issues. Bonus: this is the time of year that I struggle the most. I had really bad Seasonal Affective Disorder, even as a kid. It's gone now, although the weight, sleep side effects may be SAD, not the drug.",AlwaysForward
5,Rexulti,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 26, 2021",1,Did not work and caused weight gain in which I never ever had a problem with until then.   Also never lost the weight after 2 or so years after taking Rexulti.  Now on Abilify which seems to work better.,Mike
6,Rexulti,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 5, 2021",3,"Reading the reviews on this site was part of my decision-making process in starting Rexulti for a stubborn depressive episode (I have bipolar), so I wanted to come back and leave a review myself. It's been 30 days of .5. My depressive symptoms went away after five days on Rexulti. I was afraid of akathisia because I had it really bad on Latuda, but that dreaded side effect has been minimal to none, thankfully! The first two weeks on Rexulti at .5, I did experience agitation for a few hours after taking my pill each day. However, that has mostly subsided. I am very pleased with this dose. I'm not going to increase it because I think (know) I would get akathisia and mania. Now I'm on gabapentin, Rexulti, clonazepam as needed, and ketamine infusions every few months. Keep the faith, folks. We can do this!",Michele
7,Rexulti,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2021",2,"I have been taking 40 mg Prozac but some how it’s was not doing as good as it used to be for me, plus some fatigue more stress, low motivation and low mood. I always start medication with lowest dose so after checking with my Dr who advised to add Rexulti .25 mg, initially I had headache which continued for 3 days but slowly medication got adjusted and I am now feeling much better, more energy, more motivation and even libido is improving, so folks , don’t lose hope and best of luck in your journey against this depression",NaveedZ
8,Rexulti,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 19, 2021",3,"Rexulti was added as a booster to my trintillix. Once it was added, I gained 42lbs in 4 months without changing my lifestyle. It was the worst time in my life. Obviously, meds are a decision that a doctor should help you make, but I would avoid this drug. Once I got off of both of those drugs, I got a new psychiatrist and started taking Wellbutrin. The 42lbs came right off and my depression was sooo much better.",Lolo

I’ve been on so many things until I was diagnosed with BPD, I’m using these as a mood stabilizer and I have never felt better.

I feel happy and content and hopeful for the first time in years. The change is amazing. I almost wondered if I was manic, as this new mood is so new. I'm able to handle stress. I'm able to enjoy tasks and work. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone. I haven't had the increased appetite that others have mentioned, but even if so, I would be overjoyed just due to the increase in mood and overall feeling of bliss.",bunbuns

I had tried so many medications and none of them seemed to help enough for me to find stability. Before I started it I was all over the place emotionally and struggled with severe anger and rage episodes multiple times a day. I've been on it for a few months now and I am much more in control of my emotions, whereas before I felt like my emotions totally controlled me. I'm happier and far more stable than I have been in years, and my relationship with my girlfriend, motivation, and ability to maintain my composure and work effectively have drastically improved with the help of Rexulti, therapy, and lifestyle adjustments.",ValerieS27

I wasn't really interested in anything, I had no contact with people and only left house very minimally and gained literally 48 pounds.  I tried Saphris for a few months and then my dr switched me to Abilify and that didn't help either.  A month ago my dr switched me to Rexulti (I was also on wellbutrin the whole time and still am). So I have been on Rexulti and Wellbutrin for a month now. The1st week I started having a bit more energy and walked down the street and back every few days. The 2nd week I walked around the block and started eating better and stopped sleeping all day. The 3rd week I started contacting people agian. and going more places. It is week 4 and today  I went for a long walk and then went to the beach for another walk. I sat out side all day for a bbq and I finally feel like myself.

22,Rexulti,Depression,1.0,,"May 10, 2021",6,"I want to preface this by saying that everybody's body chemistry is different and that one person's reaction to a medication will not necessarily be your reaction to the same med. With that being said, my experience with Rexulti was a horrible one. I have been on over 10 different antidepressants and anxiolytics and this medication has caused the worst side effects I've ever experienced, namely, shortness of breath. During the second week it got to the point where I couldn't get a full breath of air in, which led to severe anxiety and panic attacks. I went to an urgent care, where they said that my heart rate was so high that I needed to go to the ER. At the ER I was given IV fluid and tested via an EKG, a chest x-ray, and a blood test. After everything came back fine, an ER doctor told me that it was likely an idiosyncratic reaction to the Rexulti in combination with heightened anxiety, and that the best course of action was to wait it out until the drug leaves my system. Good times.",Nicole

Only downfall is that I am really hungry, especially at night.

27,Rexulti,Depression,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 7, 2021",9,"Rexulti sorted out absolutely everything as far as bipolar depression and mixed episodes go, save negative symptoms (lethargy, anhedonia) which I also take Vraylar for. Additionally, I take Depakote to avoid mania. I no longer have episodes and my day-to-day mood is calm, hopeful, and energetic. No side effects that I've noticed. I thought it might have dampened my creativity somewhat, but then I stopped using mania as a crutch and just started working harder. My debut novel has won a pretty prominent award, so I must be doing something right.I attribute most of the heavy lifting in my cocktail to Rexulti because I had to go off it a couple times briefly (screw-up at the pharmacy, etc.) and my mood plummeted very quickly. The difference is like night and day!",Merunya
28,Rexulti,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 31, 2021",17,I have been on this medication for about 4 months now. Having been through literally double digits on trying medications I was reluctant and didn't have high hopes. My diagnosis is BPD and BP1. The combination along with BP1 being treatment resistant I had low hope in actually finding something that worked. Within the first week of taking Rexulti it felt that mental clouds began to part and I could start to see the sun coming through. Skip ahead a few months later and I am living virtually depression and anxiety free along with minimal manic episodes. I started at 0.5 mg for a week and I now take 1mg daily. This medication was a literal life saver and also the reason I no longer self harm. Only side note/side effect I have had is some weight gain and some tremors when I first wake up in the morning. Otherwise no other issues.,SAMMM

Side efforts went away except for me eating :(. Overall its a good drug if it helps. I would recommend it. DOWNSIDE: do not just stop taking the drug! You most taper down on the medication.

It was as if I lost that automatical chewing. I lost weight as I was unable to really eat anything except fluids. I was then put on yet another medication (can't recall the name.)

They misdiagnosed me - I really had bipolar disorder so they then took me off the Zoloft cold turkey. Then they put me on Latuda and Lamictal. Latuda made me throw up 30 minutes after taking it, plus it didn't work. The lamictal did help my mood though,  so they took me off Latuda. I felt so hopeless.

Now I feel like I can really tell a difference! I haven't felt depressed, I have more focus and creativity at work, & I've actually had enough motivation to do chores at home. I'm a little restless, which I'll keep an eye on, but I haven't noticed any other side effects besides that and the temporary headache. I'm optimistic!",LizziP

I was also on medication for high blood pressure, thyroid , cholesterol  and depression and a pain medication  After my T I A , I am on aspirin, plus a blood thinner, nerve pain, and a higher dose of my blood pressure pill.

102,Rexulti,Depression,10.0,,"January 17, 2017",69,"Started and have stayed on the very lowest mg. of Rexulti.( for roughly four months) Almost immediately I felt so much better, and as the days went on, I felt ""alive"" again. Did have an issue with hot flashes, but it didn't last long. My Pdoc is trying to see if I can get a reduction on the cost of this med. Hope he can, because if not, I have no other med that works for me, and it's back to doomsville again. I have D.I.D., PTSD; anxiety, and panic disorder. This drug really keeps me focused, and on an even emotional keel. Very pleased.",squididly face

Hot flashes, dizziness, blurred vision, weight gain, bloating, shortness of breath, and suicidal thoughts. My depression feels much worse! I'm kind of at the end of my rope because I've tried everything else, even MAOI's. But I'm definitely going to have to get off of this med. :(",Obeewonkenobi
105,Rexulti,Depression,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 12, 2016",123,"I am on my 3rd week of Rexulti. My doctor gave it to me for major anxiety and depression. My depression is gone and my anxiety is 80 percent better. My pmdd is even better, I no longer walk around under this dark cloud not wanting to live. I can't take ssris. Every med I have been given didn't work or made me suicidal or gave me every side effect in the book. I was scared first trying this because of my usual reactions to medicines, and the fact that it is an a antipsychotic freaked me out. Only side effects are jaw pain, hungry all of the time but haven't gained weight yet. I feel so much better. This medicine saved me! (Knock on wood). Give it a try. By the way, I take it alone.",Justkeepswimming
106,Rexulti,Depression,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 23, 2016",46,"I'm currently on Day 8 of the Rexulti trial pack (stepping up dosage) and so far so good...except that I feel that it's deadened sex drive.  However, that can be remedied I think.  The benefit is that my ""painful emotions"" accompanying serious depression have all but vanished.  And so far I have not experienced any akathisia, which is my most feared side effect from any of the atypical antipsychotics (such as Seroquel).  We'll see how it continues.  Yes, it is quite expensive, but I think MediCal will cover.",Bearsky

108,Rexulti,Depression,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 4, 2016",21,"When my psychiatrist finally put me on 1 mg. of Rexulti, it was a life saver. My latest depressive episode seemed intractable until then, but a major drawback has been sleep interruption, often as early as 3 am. My mind races and it's often more fun to get up than to stay in bed. I rarely sleep beyond 6 am, no matter how late I go to sleep. My much valued afternoon naps have also become infrequent too. I also take Pamelor 75 mg. per day and Seroquel 75 mg. per day. Doctor said that I'd have to come off the Seroquel since it's the same drug family as the Rexulti. Well, I've decided to get off the Rexulti and keep my Seroquel since the Seroquel helps me sleep and wears off by morning. Rexulti is absurdly expensive.",Pamie in Pompano

That will not make me happy as weight issues were already a problem. Also a bit troublesome is I am feeling tingling in my arm. from wrist all the way up to my elbow. Tingling numb, soemthing is off.
