0,Risperidone,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 14, 2021",2,"I had asked for a lithium-like category of mood stabilizer and was prescribed Risperidone. I still question what motivated my prescriber. Within five days I was exhibiting novel symptoms (delusions about how the ocean was a metaphor for my deceased parent); two days after that I was fully psychotic, with paranoid components to boot. I spent the next two years mending my fractured life. It was, hands down, the worst period of my existence. Please, be cautious with this medication. It is one of the more robust antipsychotics on the market and any off label use must be evaluated very carefully.",Slopra

2,Risperidone,Depression,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 2, 2021",3,I got prescribed 2 mg of Risperdone I liked the way it cleared my thoughts and helped me make decisions. What I didn’t like was that I gained 60 pounds in 6 months on this medication!!!!!,Lisarose527
3,Risperidone,Depression,1.0,,"June 3, 2021",6,"I have severe MDD, anxiety and BPD and I waited weeks to see a psychiatrist because there are only three where I live and they are majorly understaffed.My psychiatrist gave me a prescription for respiridone 2mg I was terrified to try it because of all the side effects. I so desperately wanted to see if might help me so after working myself up for a couple days I decided to try it I thought because it was such a low dose what could I have to lose. I took it at bedtime and about and hour later I felt extremely dizzy and very nauseous. I thought it would at least make me fall asleep and that didn't happen, I tossed and turned and felt restless for about an hour until I finally fell asleep. When I woke up the next day I could barely move, I felt incredibly dizzy and lightheaded and just awful and just out of it! I laid down hoping that I could sleep it off. I’ve read that it really has worked wonders for some people but that was not the case at all for me. Risperidone was a nightmare!!",Outofoptions
4,Risperidone,Depression,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 21, 2021",16,"I have found risperidone not to work for me. I am on it for bipolar and depression and it is making my depression and episodes of depression much more intense and worse than if I was not taking it altogether. I am unhappy with my diagnosis and current treatment plan but am struggling to find a dr who will change it or get an appointment with my GP. Please be aware this medication is not for everyone and is an anti-psychotic and a pretty heavy one at that! On the other hand please be aware it would help for certain conditions just not the one I have or my mood as a person in lockdown with depression. It is much less hard that quetiapine as I had that before. I had it to treat PMDD which was the only useful time which is bipolar but other than that for everyday life it is not working or suitable for me. Please fight for your mental health, you do generally know better! Thank you for reading x",Anonymous
5,Risperidone,Depression,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 16, 2020",17,"I used to take risperidone when I was in middle school because I was forced. I didn't remember how it made me feel. I took Citalopram with it so it probably over powered it. After getting off Risperidone when I was 13,  I'm now 23 and I am only taking 1mg of it . After reading more about it I can see I was misdiagnosed and the medicine is making me feel extremely numb and anxious. I have a hard time focusing, my memory is foggy, my stomach has had a nervous pit feeling and I've had slight nausea. I don't recommend this drug if you DO NOT have Bipolar or Psychotic tendencies. I feel like a shell of my former self. No sex drive, no emotions besides overwhelmed feelings of doom and paranoia. This is nightmare and I can feel myself slipping. Be wary of this drug!!",MiuKaai

8,Risperidone,Depression,10.0,,"January 19, 2020",13,"I have MDD. I was prescribed 0.25mg risperidone that evolved to 0.5mg and 15mg escitalopram. Risperidone was supposed to augment the effects of escitalopram and help me sleep - light sleep, difficulty to fall asleep. I report the effects of rispiridone assuming that the change in the mood (improved) is due to escitalopram. It helps me lots! I didn't know I slept so badly. Finally my nights recharge my batteries. I didn't gain weight or had an increase in my appetite. I run 40min/day + care about what I eat. I did it before, and kept doing it. I even lost 2kg that I wanted for some time (controlling the diet). I changed from escitalopram to bupropion (150mg) due to side effects, and considered stopping risperidone. I did it for 2 nights, but no good. Now I'm with 150mg bupropion-morning and 0.5mg risperidone-evening. It's so good to feel like a normal person again! But therapy is as important for me as I managed to understand my dysfunctional behaviour that (I believe) led me to MDD.",ingridn
9,Risperidone,Depression,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 9, 2020",32,"So I was admitted to the psychiatric ward of an Indian hospital; I’m an Indian male; and was given this drug risperidone to help me with psychosis. The first few days were a nightmare. I was restless and I wanted to move all the time. I gained weight on my legs during the second week. I felt lethargic throughout. I was put on 8mg of liquid and felt absolutely horrible. The feeling was so bad that I can’t even describe it. But my mind was being put under control. The audiovisual hallucinations were disappearing fast. I have to admit that after eight months and after being put on 2mg, my psychosis has vanished. Yet the hallucinations were not the problem anymore- the inactivity, laziness, lethargic feeling were. I’ve got three months left and I’m so used to doing nothing that I wonder whether I’ll be able to move again. I’m always on my bed!",drake

14,Risperidone,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 9, 2019",18,"This drug ruined my life. I was depressed before taking it, but when I was on it I had terrible suicidal thoughts that I didn't  used to have before this. I couldn't sleep and developed terrible anxiety attacks. Another side effect that I experienced was high prolactin levels which led to amenorrhea and a full face full of horrible acne (I'm not exaggerating). This of course made me more depressed and socially anxious. Coming off of it was as bad as being on the drug. Two weeks off of it, I am still experiencing the side effects of this drug, although i can at least sleep now. I'm absolutely miserable thanks to risperidone.

15,Risperidone,Depression,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 18, 2019",8,"I suffered from acute insomnia and depression due to trauma, and was put on this risperidone  by a psychiatrist. Got my first dose just before bedtime, and woke up at midnight with the most terrible panic attack (first time in my life). The panic attack basically lasted until the evening of the following day, varying in intensity. This was one of the worst experiences of my life. The psychiatrist changed my prescription to Serequel (Quetiapine), which agreed much better with me. I used it for about 2 years until my circumstances improved, and has been off all medication for 7 years now. I have never before or since had a panic or anxiety attack, so this was definitely due to the medication. I was told it was a very low percentage side effect.",JP

17,Risperidone,Depression,5.0,,"August 15, 2019",16,"I'm actually on this for pschosis. Risperidone has some terrible side effects. For example, I’m remembering the negatives of my past and cannot control those memories. I don’t like getting up mornings and I’ve got a horrible feeling in my body, in my stomach. On the other hand, I’m doing very well- no more hallucinations, no more silly thoughts against family, no more racing thoughts (as someone else put it). I am much better yet my past is haunting me. Thanks a lot to the psychiatrists for asking me to take this medication.But I cannot wait to get off it! I have three months to go; doctors said six months to one year. I hope the doctor says six months in total is OK. I cannot take it for more than six months because it also affects my study and work. I am extremely tired and have been lying down on my bed staring at the ceiling for three months. I want to get off it even though I am feeling much better.Yes, it makes you gain weight, enlarged breasts for men, and slight blurry vision.",drew

I have major depressive disorder and severe generalized anxiety. I've tried tons of different antidepressants over the years with no working results. Trying risperidone was like night and day immediately. For the first time, my head was clear of miserable intrusive thoughts and my anxiety levels were much lower, albeit still there. It does not make me sleepy and I have not put on any weight. I sometimes have trouble losing weight but I think that is more due to my lack of commitment than the medication.

I have recently started taking Topamax to offset this, so hopefully this will help. But it does help immensely with problematic thoughts and I notice a huge difference in my state of mind and overall well being when I take Risperdal.

Being able to stay present in a pleasant world I had missed for so long is a wonder, and I had no idea it treated depression.
