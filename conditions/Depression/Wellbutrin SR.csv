1,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,10.0,,"September 8, 2021",2,I have been on Wellbutrin SR since it was first introduced in the 1980’s. I had been diagnosed with major depression.  It stopped ALL signs of depression for me.  I am on this medication today.I had tried all of the medications that were on the market for depression with no success.This was a game changer for me as I am  now a Registered Nurse.,C.M.
2,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 13, 2021",3,"I started taking Wellbutrin SR 150 mg twice a day for my depression and to quit smoking, everything was getting better, I had a great night sleep by day 2 felt a little lighter with my mood, then on day 4 I felt wrong, and by my nighttime dose I ended up giving a seizure, which I have no history of, and again no sleep and tremors and horrible sweating, I was really hoping this was going to help me but I have never been so scared in my life as I was when I lost control of all my muscles and it took 2 days to start to feel better from it. My muscles hurt, extreme anxiety and insomnia.. be very careful with this drug!",CountyGirl
3,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,7.0,,"January 25, 2021",6,"I don't find this an antidepressant rather than a demeanor stimulant/energy enhancer. Goes well with SSRI's, SNRI's and many others as add-on. Personally on 150mg daily I found myself more energetic, needing less sleep, more able to focus for seriously long days, more outspoken and also more irritable. Some restlessness or a stupor-kind of feeling for a couple hours in the afternoon. All of this subsided as the months passed. 1-2 years lead to some kind of tolerance. 300mg doses seemed to give me some more focus but also made feel a bit off. Enhances the focus a little more, and likely possible overt wakefulness, irritability or confusion would subside over time. I still couldn't estimate needing such a dose myself. Initially, a combination of Sertraline and made me hypermanic for a month or two: showed up at parties drinking and talking to everyone, making new acquaintances, life choices ultimately leading to major changes etc. My psychiatrist didn't think it was a problem, though.",Nicky Stervais
4,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 28, 2020",5,I’ve been talking Wellbutrin for a couple months now and honestly mood wise I have been feeling better. I still have big mood swings (diagnosed with bipolar type2) so it really could be that. Side effects I have noticed would be extreme agitation and severe acne which honestly is disappointing because I used to have really clean and clear skin. Other than that I think it’s pretty cool.,Pris
5,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 14, 2020",21,Wellbutrin 150sr 2x daily was prescribed for me for Severe anxiety and mild depression. This medication is great for energy but I am so short tempered and I get negative intrusive thoughts.  I like the energy it gives me and I don’t feel spaced out like on some antidepressants but I’m debating going back on Effexor 75 mg.  It is better for anxiety and irritability.  I’ve gained 10 lbs but I think it’s from the Covid lockdown stress eating so I won’t blame it on the Wellbutrin. I would recommend Wellbutrin for people with lethargy but not with anxiety disorders.,Sonya
6,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 28, 2020",24,"I started Wellbutrin XL 150mg (once a day) for about three weeks, Depression and ADHD, it fixed the ADHD but it caused me to cry every single day and to have more intrusive thoughts.

7,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 29, 2020",27,"I was prescribed Wellbutrin SR as a boost for my regular antidepressant (I have seasonal affective disorder), since I am at the top-end of the dosing and didn't feel comfortable increasing. Overall excellent medication. I don't notice many side effects and it has helped to increase my energy/mood enough to make it bearable during the winter months. If I miss a dose, I get a headache which does grow into a migraine if left unchecked.",partridge
8,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 24, 2020",45,"I've been taking  Wellbutrin 150mg SR (generic) once a day for the past 6 months.  I have had no negative side effects.  It was originally prescribed to treat my Binge Eating disorder but it did nothing for it.  BUT it did improve my depressed moods drastically! No needing check lists anymore to prompt me to do all the basic stuff a normal human being should be doing, like take a shower.. So for about 5 months I was not depressed anymore, I was also less anxious and had less intrusive thoughts.  I now think,  one month later (so after 6 months), that I should bump it to twice a day (like it's intended in the first place anyways) because my depression and intrusive thoughts are slowing coming back and ruining my attempts at self-care. In the past I took Paxil and Effexor.  Paxil never worked.  Effexor worked for a while (with bad side effects), then stopped working for me.  I hope I have now found what will work for me long term!",isa

10,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 5, 2019",56,So over the last year I had noticed my anxiety has spiraled out of control and I was beginning to feel depressed a lot my Dr. suggested Wellbutrin SR 150mg for about 2 weeks then I moved up 300mg. I’m totally impressed I have no depression whatsoever since the first day I began Wellbutrin and I went to getting headaches everyday due to TMJ to very rarely having a headache.

11,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 27, 2019",41,"I had every bad side effect and it crept up over time. Insane migraine headaches, stomach pain nausea, ear pain, ringing in the ears, vision problems, vertigo, suicidal thoughts. I also had very frequent urination. The agitation  and angry outbursts were really frightening. I was completely fine for 3 months so I didn’t make the connection between the drug and the symptoms at all. I went to doctors for headaches and my bladder and even for allergies until I figured it out myself. I finally thought to myself, what did I start doing differently in my life? It was the Wellbutrin. I called my psychiatrist and told him my symptoms and he told me to stop taking it immediately. I’m glad I figured it out. I really don’t think anybody else other than myself would have. It has been a really rough few weeks with this pain. I felt almost immediately better when I stopped the medication.",LC
12,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 18, 2019",24,I took 100mg for one month and it really helped with hormonal migraines that I suffer from daily.  Cramps and body aches were gone.  Worry about the PMDD  gone.  Depression -gone. I had a lot more energy!   I really was soo happy until I realized that my face HURT with raw deep acne lesions.  My forehead was completely covered (never happened before in my life) as was the rest of my face (usually only on chin and jaw areas at PMS time).  I did experience bad  ringing in my ears for the first 3 weeks and it was tougher getting to sleep.  I could handle all that but not the pizza face.  Too bad:(  I also experienced hair thinning but that could be from PMDD.  I'm not waiting it out and letting my skin continue to scar.,Cassandra77

16,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 19, 2018",88,I tried to get by on 150 mg of bupropion but was getting weepy over little things and decided to ask to up my dosage and I am now on 300 mg.  (The other 150 mg in the evening).  I went through waking in the night as well as during the day with all kinds of negative feelings and gut wrenching crying. I really didn’t have side effects...I stayed away from people because I knew I was not quite right and didn’t want to make a fool of myself as I knew my thinking was a little askewed.  I just today—-24 days into the increase in medication felt a break through and feel like I have a new lease on life...it is like I was teetering on the edge and  have now slipped over into normalcy...,Me

So, he took me off Clonazepam 0.5 for anxiety. Instead, he prescribed Wellbutrin 150 mg 2x to go with my Zoloft 100 mg. I've never taken Wellbutrin, so why did he put me on a high dose right away?

I was so negative before, I complained so much  and started to cry in secret. It stopped completely and it works fast - I'd say immediately. Best thing for me was my life long issues with food, over eating and sugar binges just vanished. I couldn't believe It. I lost 5 kilos quickly, my appetite came back but still I don't binge on sugar. I have to watch what I eat but thank goodness I don't have the obsession with food anymore .Also stopped smoking after a few days and now I can't believe I ever smoked yuck .Over all it's a miracle drug that is life changing .I live in Egypt and its dirt cheap for 30 less then 5 dollars as its produced locally by Glaxo Smith Kline, Egypt .",Chloelynne
20,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,8.0,,"January 16, 2018",29,"Took me 2 tries to get on it, first time I tried it, it sent me into a anxiety attack for the 3 days and had to stop. I think this was my own nerves though. Waited a couple months, then tried again. This time it went much better, the first 4 days had a lot of head fogginess & jitters, but otherwise not too bad. After that, suddenly I felt much better! My mood improved a bit, I had much more energy (I wasn't getting that mid-day crash anymore), and I was getting less headaches. But the cons of it were constipation, mild moodiness, and anxiety in the evening and towards going to sleep for some reason . Not a terrible experience, but ended up being a bit too much for me to handle as a full time student.",byn
21,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,6.0,,"January 15, 2018",19,I've been taking this medication off and on for quite a few years and I have mixed feelings about it.   If you want lots of energy this is the stuff to take. If you have OCD or an anxiety disorder you might want to pair this with some Effexor or Zoloft.  I'm still in the process of figuring out a dose that works good for me.  I'm on 450mg xl and 75mg Effexor xl. If you want to drink alcohol keep it to a minimum preferably no more than 3 beers I personally find that it reduces my desire to drink and I'm also going to ask doctor about taking Contrave which is 300 mg Wellbutrin and 12.5 mg Naltrexone for weight loss (Thanks Effexor),mihulka3
22,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,,,"January 8, 2018",68,"I started taking 100mg XL in October for my depression. For the first 3 weeks I kind have just felt the same. Then I was moved up to 200mg SR and that’s when I started noticing a change about 4 weeks in. It reduced a lot of my depression along with my 10/10 anxiety. After 3 weeks, I started 300 mg SR and I definitely noticed a change. I had a lot more energy, starting doing things I once enjoyed, and did better in my college classes. With weight loss, I lost 16 pounds after the first 2 weeks of taking the 300mg SR. Overall, wellbutrin has worked so well for me and has helped reduced my depression and anxiety. 10/10",Kayyyyyyyy

If I could go back and do it over again I never would have started taking it in the first place. It wasn't until I was taking the medication for about 4 months that I really started noticing hair loss. It slowly started to get worse. On top of that I noticed ringing in my ears. The first few months were great, I had more energy energy, I lost weight, and I felt great. I have been trying to wean myself off of Welbutrin, however it's been extremely difficult because of the horrible withdrawal symptoms. Even tapering off a little has been extremely difficult.

26,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,9.0,,"September 3, 2017",67,"Dopamine and norepinephrine are two major brain chemicals in the feelings of romantic love.Serotonin (key in SSRIs) actually suppresses dopamine and inhibits feelings.This dopamine and norepinephrine (a stimulant) reuptake inhibitor can help and and DRIVE without sexual side effects, weight gain, and apathy caused by SSRIs.Often prescribed with an SSRI to counteract side effects of it.Also it is reported to have few side effects (unless you suffer from a seizure disorder that is).I recommend this over an SSRI or in addition to one.",JokerRose

I've tried Prozac, Pristiq, Effexor and Trintellix and Wellbutrin's stimulating properties are what have made this drug so effective for me. Every other antidepressant I've been on has made me feel drugged, zoned out and tired.

My symptoms before taking it were: mood swings, constant fatigue, irritable, very low to nonexistent sex drive & not able to finish anything I started. My first two weeks on Wellbutrin I had a rough go with side effects. Side effects were: couldn't sleep. Heavy/tight chest which resulted in a panic attack. Itchy palms & feet. I wanted so bad to stop taking it but Very glad I didn't. I feel great now and have lost 15lbs. The Sex drive has come back full force. Advice: take benadryl those first few weeks to help you sleep.

So I reduced to the lowest dosage before completely going off with the help of my doctor, in the hopes I didn't need anti depressants anymore. Was ok for a few weeks and boom, super depressed, suicidal, the works. So I was prescribed wellbutrin and mirtazepine for sleep. The wellbutrin worked right away and mirtazepine was great for sleep. But it only worked well for a few months. Started redeveloping social anxiety, panic attacks, fits of rage, suicidal thoughts and all that fun stuff.

I stopped taking it for about 2 weeks, but wasn't ready to give up on it - big mistake. So I went back on it for 3 days. Each day I had elevated heart rate, and felt anxious all day long.

I have been clinically depressed for about 6 years. I have tried Celexa, Lexapro, Zoloft, Prozac, and Effexor.  Trial and error is really a bummer when you want to get well and you have little to no relief. I am now on a mix of 300 mg of Wellbutrin SR and 100 mg of Zoloft and love it! The first week or two I experienced some nausea (the traditional side effect) that had me down for the count for a few days, but I stuck with it.

Then at work for the past 2 days I have been sweating excessivley and getting the feeling that I need to sit. Last night after taking the medication for 5 days I had the feeling that my head weighed a 1000 pounds and I just felt so dizzy, lightheaded, and weak I could barely walk right. I went to lay down to sleep and all of a sudden I couldn't swallow and was gasping for air. It was so scary. I just couldn't catch my breath. I could feel my throat closing up. I was rushed to E.R and they found I was having an allergic reaction to it.",kkenyon

100,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,10.0,,"November 29, 2008",62,"I tried various other anti-depressants. I have severe depression, which runs in my family. Wellbutrin works well for me.  The only noticeable side effects have been twitching, and some sleeplessness. It is expensive though. The generic was just terrible. Gave aching, even more twitching, tiredness, lack of concentration, etc. I would not recommend the generic as many other people had similar complaints. I do recommend Wellbutrin SR NON-GENERIC, especially if you have insurance.",Anonymous

102,Wellbutrin SR,Depression,8.0,,"June 8, 2008",153,"I started taking Wellbutrin six years ago. I'm still taking it.  It just works, I don't really know how to explain the way I feel except much calmer, less agitated, less sad. I thought I didn't need it any longer because I felt so good for many years and tried going off of it but after about 3-4 weeks, I felt just as I had prior to ever taking it. So, I never have any plans of going off it.",Anonymous
