4,Olanzapine,Depression,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 14, 2022",4,Zyprexa (olanzapine):I quit taking 2.5 mg Zyprexa cold turkey after taking it for six years! It was absolutely by far the worst experience in my 60-year-old life! This drug should not be on the market! It took me a full year to almost recuperate from having taken it. It works to sedate you but the price you will have to pay in the end is NOT worth it. I am guessing that most people stay on this poison because the withdrawals are absolutely horrific and take months to subside even just a little bit!,Egghead Ed

My eyes would flick upwards uncontrollably for hours at a time. I had to come off this Immediately as movement disorders are common with anti psychotics. I went down to 5mg every two days for 2 weeks then nothing and I’ve had no withdrawals whatsoever.

14,Olanzapine,Depression,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 6, 2021",2,"Zyprexa (olanzapine):I have dealt with severe depression with psychotic features since childhood.  I was initially put on Anafranil as my psychiatrist felt I had OCD characteristics as well.  The medication, while difficult to deal with,  was helpful.  After 25 years it simply stopped working and I went through a 5-year period of chaos.  I had 2 bouts of ECT which did nothing but seemingly compromised my memory, tried over 20 medications, and even gave Ketamine a shot.  Finally, Zyprexa was suggested.  The response was quick.  I could actually sleep during the night, my mood stabilized, and the psychotic features were diminished, appreciably.  It has been a life-saver.  I have gained substantial weight and am in the process of losing some of it but it is undeniably difficult.  I suppose you have to weigh the pro's and con's and, for me, the pro's are worth it.",story

I've struggled with severe depression, anxiety, and sleep issues for more than 8 years and was prescribed this because my psychiatrist had nothing left to try. While it did help my sleep and anxiety for about 4 months, it had diminishing returns to the point that it ended up making my sleep and anxiety worse, along with the depression. I'm 4 months off this drug and life is utter nightmare. I can't completely blame this drug for my current state as I've been constantly going downhill for years but this drug definitely overall made me feel worse. Beware if you have sleep issues because this might help for a little while but will likely stop at some point and your brain will no longer be able to get into deep sleep on it's own. I guess if you're suicidal, maybe then it's worth a go because what do you have to lose?",Brett

Please listen to what I am saying before it is too late for you. The first thing I want to point out is that they say this drug is not addictive. I will tell you that is the biggest crock  I have ever heard. It is beyond addicting. You cannot just stop it. The nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, depression, mania, insomnia, desire to just die to get this over with, shaking, you feel cold and hot at the same time. The withdrawals are unbearable so naturally people keep taking it. The only solution I see to this is to find a rehab for this and have professionals help me through this. I should have never been placed on this drug to begin with. I needed to gain weight. But to give me one of the strongest antipsychotic for that is criminal. Sure I gained 40 pounds but I have no life. No desire to live. No focus. No motivation. Nothing. If you are not psychotic do not take this poison.",Now an addict

I ridiculously was put on a high dose of 15mg even though my diagnosis was incorrect and I did not need this medication. It has damaged my life severely in many physical and emotional ways that I’m worrying about when I will recover from because I have been off the meds for 6 months now and I still have the effects it left me with. Caused hair thinning/loss, dry zero oil thin sensitive skin, extreme quick weight gain when on, then drastic weight loss when I went off, irregular periods, total loss of libido/sexual pleasure, dry mouth, loss of emotions/pleasure, loss of appetite and love of food. Resulting in the worst depression I’ve ever had. I am only 25 years old. It is unacceptable that this medication is being handed out to those that do not even need it and at such high doses. Also I was only on this for 2-3 months and that is how much damage it managed to cause.",Sky

55,Olanzapine,Depression,1.0,,"February 7, 2020",15,"I have had depression and anxiety for many years. I believe my psychiatrist falsely diagnosed me as having mild psychosis because of my description of my traumatic history in an unusual religious culture. I talked about demons but was not experiencing voices, images or delusions. It was just part of the culture. Olanzapine ruined my physical health - high blood pressure, severe weight gain and continual tiredness. As it sedated me I stopped talking about my issues. This made others think my mental health improved but inside I was suffering the same experience of trauma. I was threatened with detention if I stopped taking the medication until I resisted with legal action. The whole experience caused issues with my finances, my career and my health and I have struggled to recover. Maybe this medication would help with genuine psychotic issues short term but off-label usage caused me harm.
