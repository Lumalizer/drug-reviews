1,Atomoxetine,Depression,9.0,,"August 6, 2020",22,Shotgun Diagnosis off ADD/Depression/Anxiety depending on who you ask. Primary complaint is difficulty concentrating. Dopamine antagonist stimulants never helped and made me feel terrible. Wellbutrin made me feel terrible. Most antidepressants didn't help. Venlefaxine DID help but has horrible side effects.Strattera has worked very well for me in terms of ability to focus. The effects are nuanced but very real. I am planning on staying on it long term and upping dose to 60 mg.,Lwadz

3,Atomoxetine,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 27, 2017",35,"I used Atomoxetine for depression, ADHD and uncontrollable thoughts. Started with 0.5 mg/kg of body weight for 3 months. Noticed very slight improvement and was thinking to stop. However I decided to increases the daily dose to 1.0 mg/kg of body weight divided in to two ( one morning and one early evening).After three days only I noticed real improvement and after two weeks I could not believe what happened as I got rid of my uncontrolled thoughts and very noticible improvement in ADHD and depression.Plan to continue for at least two months.Before Atomoxetine  I was prescribed escitalopram among other drugs for depression/ uncontrollable bad thoughts that drained my energy for many years with no effect. I am 59 years old male",FRZ
4,Atomoxetine,Depression,8.0,,"March 25, 2013",44,"Strattera (atomoxetine):My diagnosis:  Major Depressive Disorder, GAD, ADD.  I have been on 40 mg of Strattera for over a month and have noticed a major decrease in my anxiety and uncontrolled thoughts.  It has only improved my ADD a small degree.  I have not seen any decrease in appetite maybe an increase. No weight loss and two pound gain.  Only side effects first two weeks were heart palpitations.  Please give this medicine at least two weeks before quitting.  I almost quit due to the palpitations (which were severe at times).  But now only positive results.  Drugs I am on:  Lamictal, Wellbutrin XR, Strattera 40mg.",Deb Las Vegas
5,Atomoxetine,Depression,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 18, 2012",27,"Strattera (atomoxetine):I suffer from PTSD, anxiety and depression. I was given this medicine to help with focus. It reacted in my system as an 'old school' prescription diet pill and exacerbated my symptoms. Reaction included the following symptoms over a period of 4 days:  Dry mouth, feeling dehydrated, crawling skin and scalp. Moderate sinus and eye tension headaches, intense neck and shoulder tension. Sleeping issues, very focused and specific brooding thoughts of death and dying, increased racing thoughts. Blood pressure shifts, heart palpitations, easily confused and major short term memory disruption. Extreme Panic/anxiety attacks with 'shock' effects.",MadLady
6,Atomoxetine,Depression,6.0,,"November 9, 2010",17,"Strattera (atomoxetine):Strattera definitely helped my adult ADD, and increased my focus. However, it does have a downside, a few actually. Male erectile dysfunction, sweating, rage (but I think now that I'm bipolar, depressed which may be causing it).You will definitely be able to focus better if you have minor ADD, but you will find that you can't sleep at night without a sleep aid (on Lunesta now). So the side effects are there, but it does do what it says it will. I'm going to try combining it with Pristiq and Lamotrigine to see if that is a good combination for the ADD/Bipolar/Depression.",Neil from Colorado
