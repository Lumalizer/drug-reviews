1,Zyprexa,Depression,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 14, 2022",4,I quit taking 2.5 mg Zyprexa cold turkey after taking it for six years! It was absolutely by far the worst experience in my 60-year-old life! This drug should not be on the market! It took me a full year to almost recuperate from having taken it. It works to sedate you but the price you will have to pay in the end is NOT worth it. I am guessing that most people stay on this poison because the withdrawals are absolutely horrific and take months to subside even just a little bit!,Egghead Ed

In all honesty it works for me yet I'm on a small dose of 5mg at bedtime. I can tell a huge difference in my mood.

3,Zyprexa,Depression,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 27, 2021",4,Can cause major weight gain.  I gained at least 50 pounds taking this drug. It makes you really over weight. If you are on it exercise every day and control your food intake. Probably find other ways. It is a big damper in the healing process.,Annemarie sulli
4,Zyprexa,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 4, 2021",4,"This drug is the worst thing ever created. For me, it CAUSED unbelievably severe depression, so bad that I’m  thinking of suicide. But, I was forced to take it repeatedly because of a lie told by a jealous women  who had me committed and force-fed this evil poison. Even getting off it now, every day is an enormous struggle and I worry I’ll never be the same again. Please stop making this dangerous drug. Nobody ever prescribe this, please.",Vzz
5,Zyprexa,Depression,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 25, 2021",3,"Horrible, the withdrawal from even the lowest of dosages is a nightmare. Insomnia, weight gain, leg shakes, worsening anxiety, etc - it sucks.",CDD
6,Zyprexa,Depression,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 6, 2021",2,"I have dealt with severe depression with psychotic features since childhood.  I was initially put on Anafranil as my psychiatrist felt I had OCD characteristics as well.  The medication, while difficult to deal with,  was helpful.  After 25 years it simply stopped working and I went through a 5-year period of chaos.  I had 2 bouts of ECT which did nothing but seemingly compromised my memory, tried over 20 medications, and even gave Ketamine a shot.  Finally, Zyprexa was suggested.  The response was quick.  I could actually sleep during the night, my mood stabilized, and the psychotic features were diminished, appreciably.  It has been a life-saver.  I have gained substantial weight and am in the process of losing some of it but it is undeniably difficult.  I suppose you have to weigh the pro's and con's and, for me, the pro's are worth it.",story
7,Zyprexa,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 31, 2021",1,"Do not take this medication unless you have a very specific need for it, namely, schizophrenia. I've struggled with severe depression, anxiety, and sleep issues for more than 8 years and was prescribed this because my psychiatrist had nothing left to try. While it did help my sleep and anxiety for about 4 months, it had diminishing returns to the point that it ended up making my sleep and anxiety worse, along with the depression. I'm 4 months off this drug and life is utter nightmare. I can't completely blame this drug for my current state as I've been constantly going downhill for years but this drug definitely overall made me feel worse. Beware if you have sleep issues because this might help for a little while but will likely stop at some point and your brain will no longer be able to get into deep sleep on it's own. I guess if you're suicidal, maybe then it's worth a go because what do you have to lose?",Brett
8,Zyprexa,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 8, 2021",1,I gained weight on this medication. I could tell I would have trouble controlling my appetite while I was taking this medication. I've been on other anti-psychotics and this is the only one that causes fast weight gain for me. I'm currently on 15mg but will soon ask my doctor to switch to something that won't cause weight gain like Lamictal.,Luv2021
9,Zyprexa,Depression,1.0,,"August 6, 2021",7,"I have never written a review but what I am experiencing is something I do not wish on anyone. Please listen to what I am saying before it is too late for you. The first thing I want to point out is that they say this drug is not addictive. I will tell you that is the biggest crock  I have ever heard. It is beyond addicting. You cannot just stop it. The nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, depression, mania, insomnia, desire to just die to get this over with, shaking, you feel cold and hot at the same time. The withdrawals are unbearable so naturally people keep taking it. The only solution I see to this is to find a rehab for this and have professionals help me through this. I should have never been placed on this drug to begin with. I needed to gain weight. But to give me one of the strongest antipsychotic for that is criminal. Sure I gained 40 pounds but I have no life. No desire to live. No focus. No motivation. Nothing. If you are not psychotic do not take this poison.",Now an addict

It's done its job so far. Overthinking is at an all time low, my appetite is on 10, and I've gained weight, which has always been difficult for me. It does help me fall asleep rather fast and stay asleep. The only downside is that, I am ALWAYS overwhelmingly sleepy to where I can barely function.",MB

14,Zyprexa,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 18, 2021",2,"Was given this for agitation along with severe panic/borderline psychotic anxiety and paranoia in the psych hospital, I’ve gained some weight and am tired but I wouldn’t trade my mood stability for the world. I still struggle with severe depression on top of having chronic fatigue syndrome and do hope to be put back on a stimulant for that, but I am overall very pleased with where my head is at. If you struggle with severe mental illness unresponsive to the usual first-line treatments or severe panic, agitation, and insomnia, this may help a lot, even if short term or as an as-needed basis. Am also taking 100mg desipramine plus 10mg lexapro for major depression, and 50mg trazadone and vistaril as needed for anxiety. I am myself again partially thanks to this medicine.",Bee

I was put on Zyprexa to help with severe treatment resistant depression. I also take 150mg of Effexor and 300mg of Welbutrin. In the past year my depression has slowly gotten worse and I suspect it's the Zyprexa. About 3 months ago I decided to taper myself off Zyprexa. I went from 15mg to 7.5mg for 3 months. I experience moderate sleeping issues (I sleep between 4-8 hours and wake up about 10 times during the night), nausea and a dramatic increase in depression.

I am experiencing crying spells, tiredness, extreme moodiness and just want to be alone. This medicine was prescribed for a mood disorder that I have been experiencing. I also take other anti-depressants. I don't think this is a good mix with other medicines or just not right for me.",Anonymous

64,Zyprexa,Depression,8.0,,"February 1, 2011",87,Found this medication very effective in my withdrawals from both alcohol and weed. It stops my racing thoughts and keeps me calm. However it does somewhat make you zombie like and unable to feel emotions.,cheersrichard
65,Zyprexa,Depression,10.0,,"January 16, 2011",105,"I took Klonopin and Paxil for 15 years to treat my anxiety disorder.  I had to detox from the Klonopin this past spring.  I got off the Klonopin and switched my Paxil to Lexapro (sex side effect issue).  I am also a recovering alcoholic.  My doctor did not want me on Benzo's anymore (says it increased alcohol cravings).  I stayed on Lexapro only for 9 months, but my anxiety came back strong on just the Lexapro alone.  I almost resorted to taking Xanax before I switched doctors. My new doc gave Zyprexa a chance. I am on my 7th day and I haven't felt this ""normal"" in 5 years.  I take 5mgs at night and it has ended the ""chatter"" in my head, and removed my anxiety.  Great medicine so far.",Anonymous

67,Zyprexa,Depression,,,"October 28, 2010",63,"My doctor started me on 5mg of Zyprexa and the first 2 days I slept over 14 hours falling asleep within 20 mins of taking it.  By day three I couldn't sleep at all and went on for days making me feel out of control, confused, forgetful, pretty much out of it and unable to even have my daughter home with me.  I was also very bloated, feeling and looking.  On the start of the 7th pill/day I began swelling to the point of GOUT, had breathing problems, dry mouth, was oddly emotional/ crying a lot, and hurting badly due to the MASSIVE swelling and couldn't put on any of my pants. I quit taking the medicine but the next night it all got worse with the addition of tightening in my chest. I am now having skin irritations on my hands. This medicine is bad news.",Mom in trouble

70,Zyprexa,Depression,9.0,,"April 16, 2010",43,"Developed depression and significant anxiety this fall.  Doctor started me on Lexapro, but that wasn't controlling the anxiety, loss of appetite and insomnia.  Added Zyprexa and almost instantly felt much, much calmer, could eat and slept well.  Was very sleepy/tired for the first few days but acclimated within a week.  The problem I did have was with weight gain.  Thought my life had calmed down and I could do without the medicines, but have found that not to be the case.  Did not have any issues weaning off the Lexapro and Zyprexa. Just started Pristiq yesterday.  Hoping and praying for good things.",struggling mom
