0,Lamotrigine,Depression,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 17, 2022",0,"After 4-5 weeks on Lamictal, lost close to 50% of my hair. Didn't understand why it was happening, and was incredibly upset to pull clumps out every time I washed my hair. Finally realized it was the Lamictal. Symptoms of depression had lifted over an 8 week course of TMS and Ketamine treatments. I was deeply resistant to try another drug, but my doctor finally convinced me to start Lamictal. My symptoms of depression are now almost as bad as they were before I started the TMS and Ketamine. I tend to experience strong negative side effects from all psychotropic meds, which is why I didn't want to try another. Lamictal is apparently touted as being the safest thing out there. That might be true for a lot of people, but not for me...",lauren
1,Lamotrigine,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 8, 2022",0,"This drug is THE WORST. Long story short…back in December I developed anxiety and panic attacks that were situational. I was put in lexapro and had adverse effects. Put on Zoloft, adverse effects. Put on lamotrigine and I  was seriously suicidal. I have never been suicidal or had depression or anxiety in the past, like I said my situation was acute. This medication had the absolute worst side effects. Suicidal ideations, excessive crying, severe anxiety, panic attacks, depression (that I really didn’t have to begin with), hair loss, itching, labile mood, rash that did go away, abnormal thinking. And I was only on this for FIVE WEEKS. I am tapering off this as we speak. I know for some it helps, but honestly this is poison to me. I want others to know if you experience these side effects and you’re on this medication IT’S NOT YOU!!! I have three weeks left until I’m off of this stuff and I cannot wait. I’d give it a zero if I could…",Rmpass

3,Lamotrigine,Depression,4.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 4, 2022",2,"I've taken this medicine before and now noticed it has given me severe dry skin, once I started it again after 4 years not taking it. My sides and back have a few patches of itchy, dry eczema. My headaches are bothersome, and my neck is extremely stiff and painful from the day I started the medication. I'm 5 days in and hope it goes away soon. Googling the rashes scared me of course, but all the rashes I saw were oozing and wet and widespread. Mine are very dry little patches, maybe only a handful of them in total here and there. Really scary, I'll have to keep an eye on them. More googling told me SJS starts on the chest in the front, and mine started on my hips, so maybe thats good. I realize theres a lot of areas a worrying rash can start. I'll just keep watching it. I know it takes a few weeks for positive effects to come in, but my anxiety has been made more severe. Not sure if its the omeprazole I started taking about the same time. I can be laughing one minute and crying the next",kirstie
4,Lamotrigine,Depression,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 28, 2021",6,"Lamotrigine has been a life saver. Though I do not have any manic disorders, I do struggle with anxiety and depression. I am currently on a high dose mixed with a high dose of zoloft and that combination has completely transformed my life and made me feel like myself again. It eased my mood swings, depressive episodes, and anxiety. Since being on it I have noticed a huge improvement and would recommend anyone struggling with depression/anxiety to bring it up with your doctor to see if it would be a goodchoice for you. All in all a very effective medicine.",Hal
5,Lamotrigine,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 17, 2021",5,"Better this than nothing. The medication works great at keeping my doom and gloom anxiety in check which is weird because I was initially prescribed this for my depression. But maybe I'm a special kind of messed up. I will say it does kinda numb things and make me a little tiny bit zombie but I'd rather be a little bit zombie instead of feeling like I'm living in my own personally designed nightmare. As for panic attacks and mood swings, this medication is a freakin god send. Before this medication I had a really short fuse and at any minute I could explode with rage one minute and cry hysterically the next, I would have panic attacks in public places and would physically collapse, this medication has helped control that. I still feel like rubbish most of the time, but at least on the surface I react to things a lot more patiently and with less rage. This medication isn't the be all end all for me but it helps in some small way and that's better than nothing at all.",Better this.

Couldn’t get my dr to switch me off it until May 2021 and she switched me to Lamictal…still been gaining weight like crazy. No motivation in life. Feeling so indifferent towards everything.

Lamictal literally saved my life. I was depressed to the point of being actively suicidal and borderline non-functional.  My depression has completely lifted.  It is like tons of weight have been lifted from me.  NO SIDE EFFECTS FOR ME AT ALL.  Lamictal was a last resort for me with the only other option being ketamine.  I realize this is not for everyone but it has worked wonders for me.,dbonetn
8,Lamotrigine,Depression,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 5, 2021",4,"This medication saved my life. I had Severe MDD with suicidal ideation and I had tried almost every other class of antidepressant, and was giving up hope. SSRIs in particular did not work for me and caused adverse reactions. I also have panic disorder and GAD. I was having suicidal ideation constantly out of my own volition and those scary thoughts would never leave. I was so desperate and miserable that I lost 23 pounds in two months. I was so close to giving up hope. I started this medication and was quickly titrated up to 150 mg daily in addition to Wellbutrin and xanax as needed for panic. This medication has been an absolute miracle. It has completely gotten rid of the suicidal thoughts and the physical pain of the depression. It has also helped with my anxiety. I can feel happiness, and in some ways this is still shocking to me. I did not realize how incapable I was of that emotion until I was able to feel it after almost 10 years of struggling. It has absolutely saved my life, and I have minimal side effects.",abbeyfliess13

I have suffered from depression since my early teens and throughout my life. I have had serious Complex PTSD and became very mentally ill with violent outbursts, psychosis and suicide attempts. After seeing a psychiatrist following another major depressive épisode where I lost 15 kgs in 3 weeks,I was prescribed Lamictal on top of the SSRI  I had been on. Within five weeks, I felt so much calmer. 18 months later dose is being upped to 150mg and my SSRI reduced. I feel like a normal, stable person after years of trauma which almost killed me.

I was on Zoloft previously and did NOT respond well too it at all. We switched over to Lamictal and the difference has been amazing. I’ve been diagnosed MDD for 16 years and this is the first medication I’ve been on that really worked. I started at half a 25mg pill, so 12.5mg, for two weeks, bumped up to 25mg for two weeks, and have been 50mg a day for the remainder. I had minimal side effects. Some nausea about an hour after taking my dose, which went away in about another hour and then I was just hungry. That only lasted about a week after each dose increase. I also had some crazy dreams/nightmares after upping each dose but those also went away quickly. My anxiety is much better, and an added bonus it’s prevented 99% of my migraines!

After taking  25mg for the 5th day( a full tablet) somehow I feel very relaxed and all these symptoms above -  I'm not really feeling them or I'm looking to see if I'm feeling it deep down but I'm not, that means that the meds is working right?

I was doing well for about a year. A year later I started feeling depressive symptoms again. I raised my dose then felt better. It seemed after awhile my body got use to it so it wasn’t doing enough. I’ve been in a severe depressive episode for about a year now. I’m not sure how much Lamotrigine has done this depressive episode, because I was taking two additional psychiatric medications. I think it has helped a little though. I’m now feeling much better because I started a fourth medication Lithium. For me I have no side effects with Lamotrigine which is nice. Lamotrigine is a safe medication and one worth trying. It works well with the other psychiatric medications I take.",Katirichardson
16,Lamotrigine,Depression,9.0,,"June 27, 2021",30,"Lamotrigine was a last resort for me for my treatment resistant MDD. I have been on more SSRI's than I could count, emotional flatness, brain fog, genital numbing, nausea, uncontrolled diarrhea and rather severe  hand tremors on all of them. Effexor, Remeron, Trazodone or Wellbutrin simply do not work.   I can't tolerate a therapeutic dose of any Tricyclic. I started 25 mg of Lamotrigine and noticed a difference immediately--no crying jags, no passive suicidal ideation, no GI upset, no side effects at all except very vivid dreams.  My dose has now is up to 50 mg with a goal of increasing up to 200 mg daily if needed. Honestly, this has been a game change even though I was very hesitant to begin a new med that I associated with bipolar disorder .  I am so glad that I agreed to give it a try. No more SSRI's for me EVER! The only reason I don't rate it a 10 is because I frankly expect an even better therapeutic effect as my dose goes up.",dbonetn

I’m diagnosed major depressive, GAD, OCD, PMDD, &  agoraphobic & this medication has saved my life. It’s the first med I’ve taken that had minimal side effects. When I first started I would get a bit of nausea after about an hour & then get really hungry. When I took it after a meal or with a snack it stopped happening. I can’t take it at night because it will give me some crazy dreams so I usually take it around lunch. My anxiety has decreased dramatically, I have a range of emotions now instead of just sad or angry & they’re very even, I’m getting housework done, I’ve stopped waking up in the middle of the night at 3am every night, & I’m enjoying time with my family. If you’ve been prescribed this medication and are nervous, please try it. It is a slow build up so don’t go into it expecting the process to be quick. It’s definitely worth it though.",dmy25

I took a gene test that examines how my body metabolizes drugs and which ones might have a an effect, and lamotrigine was the only medication that I could metabolize fine and was also considered a therapeutic option.

22,Lamotrigine,Depression,7.0,,"March 25, 2021",5,"Before lamictal, I had given up on psych meds and was extremely depressed, hopeless, and suicidal. I was also stuck in a relationship but I didn't believe I could survive a single day on my own. On lamictal, I started to feel better within 2 weeks. I felt calmer, happier, more at ease, and I could enjoy myself again. No pill is magic so I still struggled with depression, but it was much easier to manage and it gave me a sense of strength and confidence, which allowed me to make much needed changes in my life such as ending my relationship and moving out on my own. The only issues I had were that it made my acne worse (sounds weird but it's true) and I started experiencing some memory and concentration problems at 200 mg. Unfortunately, my personal experience with psych meds is that they stop working as well eventually, so after a couple years I had to switch. Still, I'm thankful for what lamictal did for me and I think it's a good, very tolerable drug.",Boppo93

The only problems I've had were that it took a really long time for it to start working for me; I still found myself experiencing depressive episodes six months after beginning taking it.

So, I haven't noticed any bad side effects (lymph nodes got a little swollen? which was something I was told to look out for, but it's Sick Season) but it hasn't helped in the slightest, either.

Lamotrigine I heard was the only one for helping without the weight gain so I gave it a go. It took about 2 months but it works a treat now on 300mg",Colin charles

The addition of Lamictal improved my symptoms and maintained this improvement.  There are three side effects I get with it.  I get mild nausea, mild euphoria and sleepiness.  I highly recommend it. My doctor says he has great results using it with his patients.",ChristyCee1987
139,Lamotrigine,Depression,10.0,,"November 25, 2015",84,"I originally began Lamotrigine about 6 weeks ago for Visual Snow syndrome caused by hallucinogen use. I am only on 75mg at this point as I've had to titrate up slowly. I've suffered major depression for most of my life and mild anxiety in the past year. I have noticed a HUGE difference in my mood on Lamotrigine. I have a greater sense of well being, I no longer think about suicide and I feel great about myself. It also decreases the intensity of my visual snow symptoms. I hardly notice or care about it anymore. No side effects either. This drug has truly been a blessing.",Juniper Berry

142,Lamotrigine,Depression,10.0,,"September 20, 2015",155,"I have had depression episodes all my life and had never been medicated. Three years ago, I had a huge burnout and finally opted for meds. I have tried Celexa, Effexor, Abilify & Cipralex. All of them helped to some extent but not to completely stop the depression in the long term. My psychiatrist recommended Lamotrigine. I had seen on this site so many positive reviews that I decided to try it. Like many others, it has been a miracle drug for me. I have been on it for 3 months now and aside for 2 or 3 small bumps on the road, I feel great! Except for dry mouth (not that bad), I have had no side effects. Don't give up! Good luck :-)",Rick23
143,Lamotrigine,Depression,10.0,,"September 7, 2015",78,I have bipolar 2 and anxiety. I've been on and off different medications for this over  the last 20 years. I started on a small dosage about 7 months ago. I slowly made my way up to 100 mg oncedaily. I did have some skin reactions with each increase but it would disappear after a few days. This with my 150mg bupropion and 60mg of duloxtine has changed my life. I've only felt suicidal once over these 7 months and it was manageable and it abated quickly. My moods are stable and I've been able to face some challenges that would have crushed me if I wasn't taking lamotrigine. I love being stable and level headed. I do have some minor thought blocking and trouble remembering words sometimes but I'll take it!,Kritkat228

It helped tremendously.  And still does.  I've been afraid they'd try to change it. That was one of my first medicines for severe depression.  It doesn't make you a zombie at all.  I do struggle with the making you tired or sleepy side effect.  But everything makes me tired and sleepy.  I have a couple other meds and they all make you sleepy.  I had no other side effects.  I would highly recommend trying this medication if it's offered or suggested. Give it a couple months if you're not sure if it's working.
