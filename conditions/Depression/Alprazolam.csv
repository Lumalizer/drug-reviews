As my body built up a tolerance, I had to take more. I was physically ill and had horrible rebound anxiety if I didn’t have any pills to take. I’m aware that not everyone gets hooked on it but just be very careful. Xanax is an easy fix but there are other avenues to explore before taking this.",Ava

Just knowing I have it has lessened the amount of panic attacks I have. I started having unprovoked, spontaneous panic attacks about 6 years ago. I would be sitting in my car and feel like I was hit by a train, literally, I would have trouble breathing. It was terrifying. I don’t have an addictive personality and can easily go days to a week without taking one, most times half a pill is more than enough. Xanax is absolutely life changing. My advice is ONLY take when needed. It shouldn’t be taken every day, in my opinion. it’s like a little miracle that should be respected and used only as needed.",KKJ2419

I had horrible withdrawal  when Deseryl was taken off the market and it's generic (non) equivalent Trazadone. Now  prompted as a sleep aide. Completely different drug. Then I was forced to experiment around with the different SSRI, SNRI's that are on the market. This will be the forth change of medications due to the generic not really being the chemical equivalent.  Deplorable lack of understanding of drug withdrawal  and transitioning to another.

I have built some immunity to it though   I notice my depression is extremely worse in the morning    I’m pretty sure that my tolerance is high for sedatives now as I’ve woken up during a colonoscopy and had to have extra sedation for translam epidural.   I’ve been taking it for a lot of years.  I was almost off of it but I was having trouble with the med they give you to control side effects as going off of it without a psychiatrist’s help can really be bad for you (seizures, heart issues). The withdrawal is pure nightmare material without any help.   The bf took his life at that time also so back to square one.   I do wish the doctors would stress how addictive this medication is.   Only a few should be prescribed at one time.  Taken three days and you will be weaning yourself off.  I have noticed memory issues though   Good luck to all",Ayana
