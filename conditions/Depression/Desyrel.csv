0,Desyrel,Depression,6,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 13, 2020",9,"Was given Trazodone to help fall asleep. While it did do that a few times. But it more or less simply made me lazy. Each day I had zip motivation to do anything but sit around. I wasn't sleepy just seemed to cause me not to want to do anything. Didn't even want to engage in conversation with anyone although I did not feel moody. While I do take Klonopin in the AM for anxiety, it doesn't help with my sleep. And also Klonopin didn't cause the extreme groggy, malaise or drugged  feeling.  But this medication did 'sedate' somewhat so it may be helpful in certain situations. I am looking for a more long-term everyday kind of med.",Birbhead
1,Desyrel,Depression,2,,"February 9, 2013",63,"Trazodone felt good at night, and I slept well, but I would be so nauseous the next day that all I could eat was crackers and drink 7up, and I got the poops.",nauseous nancy
2,Desyrel,Depression,10,,"May 13, 2009",159,I have taken about 10 different antidepressants and always had to stop because of the severity of side effects. I have been on Trazodone for over 6 years and love it. It is the only medicine I have tried that doesn't give me horrible side effects. I had to keep upping the dosage in the beginning but soon found a dose that worked. The greatest benefit is that it helps me sleep. I have severe insomnia and my depression gets out of control after too many days of not sleeping and trazodone combined with Ambien is helpful. I have no other side effects from it. The difference in depressive symptoms is not dramatic but is helpful. I recommend it for people who have a rough time with side effects from other medicines and for those who can't fall asleep.,Anonymous
3,Desyrel,Depression,10,,"September 5, 2008",167,I've taken trazadone for about 6 years after a brain injury caused severe depression and anxiety.  I take 200mg (down from 300 mg) at night and it really helps me sleep.  I've had no unpleasant side effects.,mi3kds1
