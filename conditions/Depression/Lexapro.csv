0,Lexapro,Depression,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 15, 2022",1,"Okay, It kinda worked 50/50. At first lifted my depression (but I got hypomania). Major anxiety at first. It helped with dissociation tho. I couldn't sleep at night and I was sleepy during the day. I also had an episode of like half(?) depression. I am not saying I don't recommend it, actually I do, because it has changed *something*. I JUST WASN'T DEPRESSED, IT WAS BIPOLAR, so that's a pity. I didn't have any serious physical side effects.

1,Lexapro,Depression,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 2, 2022",2,"I started taking Escitalopram about 3 years ago to address anxiety and depression. For the first week, I started at 5 mg and then 10 mg and experienced a panic attack and some increased anxiety, excessive yawning and nausea. These side effects disappeared within a few weeks. I am now taking 20 mg and find that this is the most effective dose for me. The medication helps me to feel more motivated, my brain feels calmer and I am more easily able to counter negative thoughts rather than dwelling on them, I have more energy and my mood feels more stable with less ups and downs especially around my menstrual cycle. I also feel less anxious in social situations and previous situations where I would feel anxiety, such as before making a presentation at work. Overall, this medication works really well for me and I’m satisfied.",CatLover42391

Shaking as I took it but I needed to stop the depression and anxiety. Took it at 8pm, because the other time I took it was in the AM and fought drowsiness. Slept great. But the drowsiness hit me at 8am. Still drowsy but trying to push through it so I can enjoy the day. The comments have been great and help as I start this journey.",Boxergirl

4,Lexapro,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 15, 2022",0,"This medication literally traumatized me... my first antidepressant after being absolutely terrified to try medications and it was the worst experience of my life.

6,Lexapro,Depression,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 18, 2022",3,"I've been on Lexapro for about 6 months now for depression and I cannot express how much I love this medication: my depression symptoms have decreased by about 90%! Yes I did have some side effects: increased anxiety, agitation and strange mood swings but be patient, these do eventually go away. It took about 8 weeks for it to work and during that time I did think about quitting, so I strongly urge anyone in their first 8 weeks experiencing side effects to hold it out because it's worth it in the end. I was originally on 10mg but I've increased to 15mg as I was feeling less depressed but unenthusiastic on 10. The extra 5mg has given me more energy and positive emotion.",Toby
7,Lexapro,Depression,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 18, 2022",1,"I got on Lexapro shortly after the birth of my daughter. I recently quit taking it after 3.5 years. Lexapro helped me to come out of my depressed state, somewhat. I no longer felt sad, but at the same time, I did NOT feel joyful. I increased my dosage to 20 Mg and still didn't feel a difference. I also felt like it numbed my feelings. In those 3.5 years, I cried only once. During major life events (like losing a loved one) I felt nothing. The two reasons I decided to stop this medication were because it didn't help to achieve a more ""happy"" state and I gained 20lbs. I started this medication weighing 120 and am now at 140. Healthy eating habits and exercise have always been part of my routine so the weight gain could not be attributed to a sloppy lifestyle. I could no longer deal with the weight gain. The weight SLOWLY came. 5lbs at first was not that big of a deal, but when I could no longer fit into my clothes I'd had enough.",Danielle

10,Lexapro,Depression,3.0,,"December 8, 2021",3,"I really regret taking this. I went on a low dose of it for anxiety, and the side effects at the beginning were tremendous. It was like having the stomach flu for weeks, and I was so sleepy and tired and foggy. But eventually, it worked. I felt happy again and the anxiety was manageable. However, it slowly seemed to lose effect over the months, and I was back to being irritable, but with a side of tired (which is kind of extreme because I'm on Wellbutrin, which has a stimulating effect). I couldn't take being tired all the time, so I weaned slowly off of it but still had discontinuation syndrome. It was a nightmare. After weeks of weaning, I slowly began to feel physically normal, but it's like my brain can't remember how to make serotonin anymore. I'm not a crier, but I cry all day everyday. I'm so miserable but I'm afraid of going back on any SSRI after this, it feels like a trap. I've never experienced this with Wellbutrin, citalopram, or Prozac. I wish I'd never taken this.",Regret
11,Lexapro,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 2, 2021",4,"I started lexapro in summer of 2020 after dealing with horrible depression and anxiety. I had previously tried Wellbutrin and it made me feel absolutely horrible. As a last resort my doctor prescribed lexapro, I started at 5mg for the first week and then went up to 10mg which I stayed at for just over a year. It helped my depression and anxiety more than I can describe, and I don’t remember suffering from any awful side effects. I may have gained a little weight, but I was also taking another medication so I’m not sure which it was. Anyways, lexapro gave me my life back without debilitating anxiety and depression. It’s worth a try if you’re struggling. I have since weaned down to 5mg with no side effects, and I plan to discontinue the medication at my next check up in three months as I am in a good place mentally now. I hope this review helps someone who may be hesitant about trying it. I know how hard it is to be struggling and scared to try a new medication.",Kayleigh23
12,Lexapro,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 5, 2021",7,I have had MDD for 23 years.  Originally put on Zoloft and it worked well for several years.  After noticing decreased effectiveness was switched to Effexor but had bad side effects from missing one dose.  So switched to Trintillex which did not help me.  I now have been on lexapro 10mg and Wellbutrin 150mg for 1 month and am doing much better  I was afraid to start Lexapro related to listed side effects.  I haven't experienced ANY side effects.   My doctor was a little surprised but I did well on Zoloft and they are closely related.  A game changer for me.,Bjo
13,Lexapro,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 28, 2021",11,"I have struggled with anxiety and depression as long as I can remember. My family doctor would never prescribe me anything because I was like 14 when I first came to him with my concerns. Fast forward to 24 and I have my first child. My depression and anxiety worsened exponentially. I was crying all day, each day felt like years, it was such a dark time. The second my OB saw me for a follow up I was sobbing to her. She prescribed me 10mg and told me to give it a few weeks. When I tell you I noticed a difference in DAYS. Obviously not the case for most, but this med was exactly what my brain needed. I still feel all the emotions, they just don’t overwhelm me. I can take care of myself and my child with ease. It saved my life truly.",Lyssa

I realised how much anxiety and depression had taken a toll on me prior to medication, because when the symptoms came back after lexamil I fell apart.It’s not an easy decision, but I’m cutting my losses for now and just going to continue to take the medication.

16,Lexapro,Depression,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 9, 2021",6,"I've been on quite a few medications in the past for depression & anxiety. I've been on Zoloft, Paxil, Prozac, & Celexa. Celexa is in the same medicine family as Lexapro, but is milder. I maxed out the highest dosage on Celexa for awhile, & was still feeling pretty bad, and stressed out about different situations going on in my personal life. Lexapro has been the medicine that works for me. I found that Lexapro (Escitolapram Oxalate) had made me feel a little weird at first, for a few weeks, like tired and drowsy. I figured out to take my pill at bedtime since it made me tired. By the 3rd-4th week, I was feeling like a new person. I felt happier, like I wanted to do the things that I used to avoid, even more. Lexapro actually helps me sleep, & wakes me up too, after 7-8 hrs. of sleep. I feel that it has been a great fit for me. I've been on Lexapro for 6 1/2 yrs. now. It has helped out my anxiety & depression dramatically.",Kate43

19,Lexapro,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 30, 2021",5,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a while back. I felt as if I had no purpose in life and all there was for me was suffering. I could feel little to no lasting joying in things and I felt like a shell. I contacted a psychiatrist and I was put on a starting dose of 5mg and wow, it started to make all the difference in weeks. I am now on 10mg and I am starting to feel like myself again. I have far more energy and motivation and I genuinely enjoy doing things again. I find myself being able to look forward to things and just enjoy life. A few months ago I couldn’t have imagined any of these lovely feelings returning to me but here they are. I am still working through a depressive episode but I have come a long way thanks to Lexapro. I truly recommend it to anyone struggling with anxiety or depression like I am. Something major I must mention is that Lexapro mainly helped with my depression and not so much my anxiety, but it certainly has made it more tolerable.",Pers0n
20,Lexapro,Depression,9.0,,"August 29, 2021",73,"Like all of you I read every review on the drugs I have been prescribed. It helps on those really bad days to hear someone has been helped. I was put on Lexapro 20 years ago after a run of deaths in my family and on the fire dept. My doctor explained it like this, you have a natural immunity to bad events, but if you experience too many too quickly you may not be able to return to normal by yourself. After 20 years I began to feel emotionally numb. I weaned myself off Lexapro 20mg thinking I could deal with things myself. Then covid hit, and a run of bad life events again. After the worst year and a half of trying different anti depressants I'm back on Lexapro. Its only been a week and a half but already I feel slightly better. Taking a medicine to improve your life experience is not a weakness, we are only here for a short time try to enjoy it as much as possible.",John
21,Lexapro,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 29, 2021",9,"I have recently decided to try antidepressants after finally acting on the knowledge that I was not happy or thriving in my life.I started Pristiq and took that for 6 weeks. I felt terrible. I was so disappointed and I felt so hopeless. I  worried that I wasn’t depressed but just wasn’t cut out for life or my personality was flawed. I went back to my GP who prescribed Lexapro 10mg. I’ve been taking this for 6-7 weeks now, and my life has absolutely changed. I feel a joy for life that I can never remember ever feeling before, I have energy, I don’t cry every day, I am kicking goals at work, my social life is enriched and I can focus properly. I didn’t realise that I was living in a constant state of anxiety until it went away. If you are considering antidepressants, my best advice is to try them. You might need to try a few, but antidepressants are the best decision I have ever made.",Anonymous
22,Lexapro,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 19, 2021",64,"This medication pulled me out of a deep and very severe depression, almost instantly after taking it, my mind felt much more clear, my anxiety went away, and I noticed my sense of humor had returned with a vengeance, and my ability to enjoy simple and non simple things in life sky rocketed. I was smiling all the time basically. I’ve been on it for about five months now, and have no plans of discontinuing it ever. This medication was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made in my entire life.  The side effects were difficulty reaching orgasm for about a month and a half, nausea, insomnia and general discomfort for about a month, I couldn’t sleep no matter how hard I tried for about a week straight, then I would get maybe an hour or two a night, after a month my sleep cycle  went back to normal, my ding dong began functioning properly as well as my libido and  nut ability, and the anxiety relief, and depression relief as well as my energy level sky rocketed from the point forward.",That dude
23,Lexapro,Depression,4.0,,"July 14, 2021",5,"Negative: Nausea and general discomfort and constant yawning and mild tiredness. I found myself lying in bed all day. My head felt like as if I've been crying, and my body felt slightly detached with a shaky sensation, similar to a bad hangover. Feel a weird anxiety/anguish. Regularly I feel like I’m on the verge of crying for no reason (I never cry). I cannot focus or relax. I became less productive than before. Positive: Got pleasure from simple things and my sense of smell became more vivid. However, it’s only after intense negative effects of the drug wear off. And even then, I need to push myself, for example, hike/work all day. But it's getting more difficult to push myself and I've been pretty much useless. At 4-weeks now and probably stopping, I tried to experiment taking it at night sleeping through the worst part, but it’s a similar deal. It's a shame there is a lot of potential, if it wasn't for all of the side effects I would have considered it a miracle drug.",Leo

I'm experiencing dry mouth, heartburn, digestion issues, increased anxiety and depression and suicidal thoughts have increased considerably. I'm not finding joy in any aspect of life at the moment.

I had been off it for 2 months and was feeling fantastic.Well, 3 weeks ago I crashed and all the old depressive symptoms and anxiety are back.Doctor put me back on 10mg for the first week then 15mg.

It did help with mood for probably the first year or two but I feel like the benefits have worn off. I've noticed it doesn't do much to help my anxiety either. While it was a great med at first, I would probably need a higher dose to continue receiving the benefits. And weight gain became a definite problem for me!  I was on 20mg for years but decreased to 10mg to see if that would help with my weight, but unfortunately no.Not everyone will have this issue on Lexapro but it's definitely something to watch out for!",Chel
27,Lexapro,Depression,3.0,,"June 19, 2021",3,"I didn't have a nightmare experience with Lexapro, it simply just didn't work for me I've been on 10mg for a little over three months and Lexapro hasn't helped with my anxiety, panic attacks at all. I will say that it has helped my depression just a little bit, but not really enough. I started taking it during a really bad depressive episode and I felt a little bit better after a few weeks of taking it, but I've also felt bad again on it so I think it was just me going through the natural fluctuation of my depression. I couldn't go up to 20mg because I was already having side effects at 10mg and I didn't want to make it worse. No crazy side effects, just feeling like I need to sleep for 14 hours and always feeling tired and out of it. Also, I have a general loss of motivation. Obviously depression takes away your motivation, but its a slight constant numb feeling. I've tried other SSRIs that made me feel like I had no emotions and Lexapro didn't do that thankfully.",kitten18

31,Lexapro,Depression,10.0,,"March 13, 2021",187,"I've been on Lexapro for a year. I resisted it because I was afraid meds would take a toll on my overall health longterm (ie maybe give me hypertension, acne, weight gain, hair loss, etc). But I want to tell anyone that is hesitant to start SSRI's: stress/depression take a toll on your body. I was beating myself up mentally and emotionally, bringing myself to tears and destroying my self-esteem, telling myself I was worthless. This was my life. If you think that treating yourself like this isn't hurting your body, with all the terrible things stress/depression do on the cellular level, you're wrong. Potential side effects of SSRI's aren't as bad as depression. I feel so much better now. I don't tear myself down and cry every night. I don't catastrophize. I move on from things when they don't work out instead of taking a week to convince myself I've ruined my life. I am NOT ""CURED"", but that ISN'T what the SSRI'S are for.

32,Lexapro,Depression,1.0,,"March 9, 2021",4,"I was prescribed Lexapro in September of 2020 for OCD and Depression. Starting at 10mg, I gradually worked my way up to 40mg. I was on it until December of 2020.I naively thought Lexapro would help alleviate my anxiety and depression. Only a few weeks after starting the prescription, my brain fog went from bad to absolutely awful. I began to have searing headaches, 24/7; it felt as if someone was tightening a belt around my head and making it swell up. Electrical shocks/""brain zaps"" were frequent. My intrusive thoughts got 10x worse. I also acquired a voracious appetite. I gained 40 pounds in three months while on Lexapro. I still suffer from intense brain pain and headaches, and I'm now seeing a neurologist to help deal with this excruciating pain. I can hardly get up and do work in the morning.

The  first time I felt it helped. After some time I felt it was not helping and when I stopped it didn't make any meaningful difference. Took it again a few times afterwards for a couple of weeks, but stopped again as it didn't help at all. Side effects were quite low for me. The first few doses were very activating and I had trouble sleeping, but it went away quickly. Some minor sexual side effects. Very good in terms of (lack) of meaningful side effects, but limited improvements on my condition. I suspect for me it was not due to lack of serotonin, but dopamine instead.",avalokiteshwara

In a way it made my depression better, but I felt more depressed than ever, just in a different way, it’s hard to explain. It dropped my sex drive to 0. It got rid of my memory and made it impossible for me to focus on anything so I started failing classes. I ate and slept more, which made me feel horrible due to my ED. It made me completely numb, I couldn’t feel any emotion at all, positive or negative. I had no interest in doing anything. Because of Lexapro I had more suicidal ideations and started self-harming again. I stopped taking it after 3 months of waiting for it to get better.

37,Lexapro,Depression,8.0,,"January 17, 2021",16,"I’m in my early 30s. This was my first time taking antidepressants after struggling with depression and anxiety since I was a teenager. It did a great job of managing my depression and anxiety. It took the edge off and evened me out emotionally. I stopped being irritable and snapping at all those around me, I didn’t sweat the small stuff, and I didn’t get stuck in negative thought patterns. I no longer had intrusive thoughts. It made me a better person. There is a downside: the weight gain. In the first 8 months of being on Lexapro I put on 20 pounds. Over the next 12 months I put on an additional 22 lbs, and was tipping the scales at 212lbs, 42lbs more than my normal weight. When I started outgrowing size large shirts I decided that enough was enough and stopped taking Lexapro. Within 6 months I was back to 170lbs and I didn’t change anything about my eating habits or workouts. If anything I was eating way worse than before.

38,Lexapro,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 6, 2021",598,"This pill changed my life. I was very skeptical to take it after reading about the terrible side effects. Indeed I had awful side effects within the first weeks including waking up shaking, increased anxiety and an increase in suicidal thoughts. In fact I begged the doctor to change me onto something else but he told me to stick with it. After 4 weeks I was absolutely transformed and I still honestly can’t believe the change it made to me. I’m no longer crying everyday, I’ve started enjoying all the things I used to and rediscovering myself. I’m no longer angry or unable to contain my emotions.I was in the position you were reading reviews and asking myself if this can really help me. It can!

I lost any interest in eating, hygiene or things I loved to do.  Each time I saw the nurse practitioner, I told her I was getting worse and begged her to take me off it.  She refused, telling me ""I like trying to play with the dosages"".  I continued down a black hole to the point I couldn't even eat.  Finally when I broke down crying and begging her to try me on something else.  She put me on Zoloft.  In months I was MUCH better.",Santa

It did not work right away. After taking it for a week it made me stop crying every day. After 2 months I was starting to get the benefits from it. I knew I needed to go down in dose only because of how tired it made me. Sooo I did it the correct way. I broke my 20 mg in half and took 10. It takes your body a  good couple weeks to get used to taking the 10mg. My body wanted the 20mg again but I held off and gave it time. After a month of 10mg I went down to 5mg.

After 6 weeks most of the side effects eased and anxiety management was improved. Earlier this year had an upheaval in my relationship & was very depressed. My psychologist recommended trying a higher dosage of Lexapro and Doctor agreed to increase to 20mg.  Unfortunately the side effects experienced two years ago returned. Took 4 weeks for the side effects to ease & both anxiety and depression are now manageable.  Still seeing my psychologist as just important as the medication for me to ensure I have the right support structure in place.

92,Lexapro,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 17, 2019",60,"I've been on Lexapro 10 MG for four months to treat depression and PTSD. Anxiety and depression have significantly improved. The adjustment period was challenging. For the first 2 weeks, I felt like my depression was gone. During the next 3 weeks I felt lethargic with low motivation. After 1.5 months I thought the medicine was no longer working, as my depression worsened. My psychiatrist upped the dosage to 15 MG. At 15 MG, I had fatigue, nausea, headaches, and slept 13-hour nights. I went back to 10 MG, and the negative side effects ceased. After 4 months, I think Lexapro is effective. I don't have inner negative chatter and don't feel like my brain is shutting off from being tired. I feel happier and more confident. I have improved motivation to go to work, exercise, and socialize. I feel more relaxed. No weight gain and SI is gone. Some days my brain is foggy. Depression still comes one week prior to my menstrual cycle. I'd say try to get through the adjustment period. Good luck!",skittles2019

The first time I took it I felt much better within two weeks. Two years later I tapered off it very slow. Usually 2.5 mg lower each month for 4 months. Recently I have not been able to control my depression and with current stresses I dropped so low again. I’ve now been back on Lexapro for 3 weeks, after two weeks you notice a bit or a difference. Mostly a numbing feeling over all your emotions. Currently I still feel the depression and the anxiety is awful in the morning so I’m going to try 15 mg and see how that goes. I’ve noticed when I drink Yerba Mate my anxiety gets much worse so I’m going to remove all caffeine for a while. Hang in there buds, I know how awful our minds treat us.

107,Lexapro,Depression,8.0,,"April 9, 2019",45,"The good side of Lexapro reduces unwanted thoughts associated with depression ie suicidal thoughts. The other side of Lexapro is it's ability to increase interest in life activities. There are more pros to Lexapro than cons. An added benefit is that it builds up your inner strength to navigate through anxiety. It also mysteriously decreases interest in sex, which is not always a bad thing. Lexapro isn't physically energizing. It's more sedating, but also not great for insomnia. The best part of Lexapro is that it works for many months maybe many years and buys you plenty of time to adjust your life to make it better. The sad part is that it's not euphoric which would be nice every once in a while.I  had a rare side effect starting Lexapro where I'd have to take OTC pain relievers because of muscle pain, but it went away after a month or two.",thomas aquinas

I started off at 10MG's, and moved up to 20 MG's. This drug actually made me less self conscious, and more outgoing. However, it would make me feel 'slightly' manic, in the sense I would talk non-stop if the opportunity presented it self. It doesn't mix well with Alcohol, (nor the day's after, WOW).I would say this medication is okay. It works better for depression. Be mindful about what you seek out of itFor Anxiety, not so much.

The first glimpse of it working came in around six weeks.  I was scared to believe it. These days I have a happier base level. I do not feel overly happy or out of touch with my emotions. Actually have the ability to feel all of my emotions and not try to run from them.  I still struggle with some loop thinking but it is not as bad as it was.  Overall I am so incredibly grateful for this drug in my life.

I still had intermittent depression- I would just get into these moods where one little thing would put me in a fog of sadness and hopelessness.  I cried a lot, was distracted, and had a lot of negative racing thoughts.  My provider recommended Lexapro since it works on a different neurotransmitter than Wellbutrin.  I just feel normal.  I don't feel like things are dulled - just that I can control my reaction better.  I can feel sad, but I don't feel depressed. I don't dwell on feeling sad.",EllieEight

I've been tapering off, I'm down to 1mg, maybe less. I'm learning to deal with thoughts, the few that have come back by praying, breathing and relaxing.

It doesn't seem to affect my weight at all, and I feel completely ""normal"" for possibly the first time since childhood (about 30 years ago).

Not only can I hold an extended conversation with someone, I'm also able to appreciate this improvement in my life instead of feeling like it doesn't matter.Unfortunately, my libido is also gone. Since it was low to begin with, I don't miss it too much, but one day I'd like to know what having a libido is like. Wellbutrin, perhaps?",Thanks Lexapro

I also had swelling and red lumps form under my left eye around this time. Week 4 brought insomnia and week 5 brought the rash on my legs. By the end of week 6, I had 360 degrees rash on legs that burned and bleed with lumps filled with puss. The pain was continuous and severe. Hence, off meds.

If no improvement, up the dose per your Dr's permission or switch to another. The side effects are mild, and that is despite what anyone says to the contrary.

292,Lexapro,Depression,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 9, 2015",114,"I just started this medicine 3 days ago and I cannot express how much of an effect it has had on me already. I just graduated high school and became depressed soon after, severe anxiety where I couldn't go out to eat without having to vomit. I also couldn't keep focus on anything, especially when trying to talk to people, and overall was in the worst state of my life. Thought I was hopefully, constantly having break downs etc. the doctor prescribed this medicine to me a few months before graduation due to anxiety and overall not feeling myself, I was definitely skeptical and taking medicine in my eyes was a sign of weakness so, I put off the treatment hoping I could cure myself out of this funk. I went to ctb and it helped but it was mainly focused on anxiety. I stopped going because it seemed a waste of my time. Graduation rolls around, my best friends leaves for college really early and my life falls apart. A week was about all I could take of the constant emptiness, headaches and nauseous I got from being so depressed so I decided to start lexapro. The doctor prescribed me 10 mg and the first day I took it (in the morning) I was in a state of euphoria. Just a little background on myself, I was never that outgoing but constantly happy. Never the one to be outgoing in front of strangers and was very conscious of people around me. Not on this pill. I was loopy, could not stop laughing and would not shut up. Although this was great, it did not feel normal and I had very bad dizziness and insomnia that night as the drug began to wear off.. But I wasn't laying in bed miserably like I did countless nights before, I kind of sat there with a smile so it was actually kind of creepy. That morning I called my physician and asked if this was a normal or okay reaction considering I've been told you shouldn't feel anything for 4-6 weeks. He mentioned that it was ""weird"" that I had this response but it was a negative one. He recommended I cut my dosage in half and stick with taking 5 kg a day since the 10 obviously overtook my body. Within hours of hanging up I popped half a tablet and can honestly say I felt happy without many side effects. I continued this the following day and my relationship with my boyfriend, family, and friends has greatly improved, I sleep better, I can laugh and actually mean it and I can go in public places without constantly being self conscious. I've heard it can have bad results in week 1 and 2 but after taking this medicine for only 3 days, whether it's the placebo effect or not, has saved me and helped me to return to my normal self.",Shayyyyyyd
