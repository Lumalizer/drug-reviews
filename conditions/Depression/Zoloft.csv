1,Zoloft,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 7, 2022",1,"10/10 its really nice. I am taking 75mg a night combined with present awareness, walking, positive thinking, offering positivity to everyone everywhere I go, and healthy eating. Zoloft is incredible and a very special part of the new me. Absolutely awesome! Effects: flying high with happiness, improved focus, lots of energy. Side effects: little bit of a pit in my stomach here and there and some teeth clenching.",flavorlast
2,Zoloft,Depression,,,"February 9, 2022",4,"Hello everyone,I just wanted to thank everybody who has taken the time to write a comment on Zoloft, I  never wanted to give it a try because of the things you hear about antidepressants and their side effects etc. I will be starting on 25mg in a couple of days and I will be back in a month or so to do an update thank you again everyone and stay strong",Iktis
3,Zoloft,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 8, 2022",6,"I was experiencing extreme depression bouts, and bad anxiety. Sometimes I would cry uncontrollably all day. I began 25 mg of Zoloft a little over 3 weeks ago. I am one of the rare people that noticed a change within the first few days, and it has been great the whole time so far. I feel like myself again, and have not had an emotional spiral since beginning this antidepressant. Anxiety is also much less. I anticipate my doctor will up my dose in a few more weeks, and I will probably stay on this SSRI for a while until my brain can do its job on its own. I am so glad I gave this a try. I felt so lost and alone, and thought I was going crazy. I just needed a little help.",Pam
4,Zoloft,Depression,8.0,,"November 28, 2021",1,"For depression and anxiety. 50mg a day. Have been taking for almost 6 months.Overall it has helped. My moderate anxiety has definitely lessened. My depression (which I would also describe as moderate pre-Zoloft) is milder now. It took about 4 months for the side effect of occasional weird thinking to wear off, but I was drinking alcohol on zoloft for most of that time period. I haven't been drinking for the past month. The big knock on Zoloft for me (and the only reason it doesn't get a 10) is the libido side effects. It has become difficult to ejaculate, and when I do, it doesn't feel as good as it used to. Viagra helps with erection and ability to ejaculate quite a bit, but it's still not the same as pre-Zoloft. It's a trade off I guess. I have also put on quite a bit of weight, and faster than I ever have in my life. I think there's a correlation to zoloft but can't be sure.",judonerd
5,Zoloft,Depression,9.0,,"November 25, 2021",18,"Been on it 3 months at 50mg every morning. It hasn't been extreme,  the side effects just never hit me thankfully. Of course the first day was a bit of nausea. Overall it is helping. The effects are fairly mild.  which is what I was looking for. My depression is average and not severe.  Please don't give up on yourself because with mental illness we tend to make things worse than they really are. I was also an opiate addict and if you're an addict don't expect to feel high from zoloft. At first I was craving a high from this drug, I wanted to feel so happy 24/7 but that's just ridiculous because you still need to put in the work to get this medication to work well enough that your depression subsides. You can't just pop zoloft and expect to feel happy. You have to get the ball rolling with positive thoughts and a better lifestyle. You can't take your zoloft and fall into the same pattern of laying in bed all day. You need to force effort.",George
6,Zoloft,Depression,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 22, 2021",5,"Zoloft is amazing! I got on it a week ago, and I was nauseous & vomiting for a few days, however, if you’re willing to ride out the side effects for a little while, this medication works wonders! It has calmed my nerves, & made me a better wife. I was accusing & interrogating my husband because my anxiety was through the roof, & suddenly, I’m not worried anymore. I still have bad days, but it has given me a better outlook on life, it has made me a better student & wife, & it has been life changing after only a week! Don’t give up! Be patient & let the medicine do it’s job!",Mere

While I still am very depressed, I don’t cry all day.  A few things interest me, but for the most part, I’m just treading water.  The thing is, Zoloft makes me feel detached; it takes the edge off.",Karen
8,Zoloft,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 8, 2021",8,"After around six weeks my appetite was the first thing to come back. Suddenly, after over two months of pure nausea and vomiting due to my anxiety and depression whenever I tried to eat or think about food, I look forward to my meals again. I have seen a HUGE reduction in my intrusive suicidal thoughts. My anxiety levels have gone from an 8 to a 4. Today they were pretty much at a 2/3. I wake up and I don’t dread the day. I can think about beginning to process my emotions again. I feel hopeful about the future. This is my second time using Zoloft and this time I can see a much more noticeable effect for some reason (I think my depression was worse this time around). I stigmatised myself SO much for having to back on the SSRIs after going through the whole weaning-off process only months before, but oh my god am I glad I got over that stupid idea. Who the hell cares that you take a pill everyday! I also take a multivitamin, same difference. Do it please if you need.",Zerosum202
9,Zoloft,Depression,1.0,,"October 28, 2021",1,"All it took was one dose to completely discombobulate me. Before this I've been anxious and depressed for weeks but yesterday I was nearly incapacitated by it so I decided I would try Zoloft to see if it would help me. This drug, a few hours after I took it, sent me into what I would describe as a mental and physical rock bottom. I felt a wave of deep sadness accompanied by an even stronger feeling of exhaustion. All I could do was sleep and cry. My mornings are normally my best hours of the day, but today, I feel empty. I just want to go back to the nightmare I am familiar with. This is straight up terrible.",Coffee queen
10,Zoloft,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 28, 2021",25,"I’ve been suffering with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for several years. Without this medication I would probably have ended my own life a while ago. My disease sucks, as it’s caused me to lose my career, friends, and social life. Two things are keeping me sane; my wife and Zoloft. The depressive thoughts and constant worry and anxiety about my condition has almost ceased thanks to this wonder drug. I’ve tested five other antidepressants that had little to no effect on me. For some reason, Zoloft works wonders. If you struggle from depression, do NOT give up on finding the right medication for you. There are so many options, and even though they claim to work similarly, they clearly don’t. Don’t give up. Keep fighting through. You are incredibly strong. I believe in you.",Will

It was fine for the first three weeks (due to it not doing anything yet), but the moment it began to work I felt horrible. My suicidal thoughts were five times worse, and it actually made me feel MORE depressed. It was all I could do to get out of bed every morning. My sleep was horrible and I completely lost all sex drive. I also got nausea and very bad heartburn.",alol

14,Zoloft,Depression,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 17, 2021",1,"Unfortunately, while Zoloft (first 50mg daily and then 100mg and then back to 50mg) did work for my depression and OCD at the 100mg dose, it also came with a lot of side effects for me - nauseous stomach, diarrhea, weight loss, lack of energy, and temporary short-term memory loss.  All of these side effects went away when I went off Zoloft.  I am amazed with how much better I feel without it.  I now take another antidepressant (Paroxetine 20mg daily) that actually has a side effect of moderate constipation, which I will gladly take, and it is working well right now for the depression and OCD.  I now have more energy as well.",Zue123
15,Zoloft,Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 10, 2021",2,"I have always struggled with depression and anxiety but I had a bit of depression that had left me in my bed for six months. I decided to go to my doctor. I had previously (2 years prior) taken Citalopram I didn’t like the sexual dysfunction symptoms. I was given 50mg Sertraline (Zoloft). I felt awfully fatigued and tired the first time I took it as well as dizzy and spaced out (would recommend not driving!). This continued over the next few weeks, I constantly felt sick and didn’t want to eat, felt out with my body. I stuck with it and by the 5th week I was feeling less side effects but still felt it wasn’t touching my depression. I went to the doctor and got 100mg. After about 2 months I felt happy for the first time ever. It was a strange feeling, and my thoughts drifted to moments of almost ‘eurphoa’ to be experienced for a few minutes. Would recommend starting on the lowest dose and building up. Still sexual dysfunction side effects but worth it.",HBN
16,Zoloft,Depression,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 6, 2021",1,"I have depression, GAD and OCD and I was prescribed Zoloft by my nurse practitioner. I feel lucky that this is the first drug I tried for my depression and it worked for me. I was in a very dark place and decided to get on medication, and now I really do feel like myself again. My advice: START SLOW. Slower than you think you need to! I started with 12.5 mg and then worked my way up to my current 50 mg over the course of a few weeks. It was a bit of an adjustment starting out but nothing crazy because I started so low. I have now been on 50 mg for about 6 months and I think I may ask to go up to 100, since I do still feel depressed from time to time. But 100 is a pretty normal dose for an adult.",Ziggy
17,Zoloft,Depression,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 2, 2021",6,"I agree completely with the other post regarding healing being holistic. Medicine is sometimes necessary, but isn't the only remedy. I also use a holistic approach. Exercise, meditation, self care, fresh air, soul nurturing, healthy thinking. And I also. Absolutely swear by my Zoloft. It returned me to myself. For me, it does not create apathy, I still feel deeply, cry, and love hard. But I stopped feeling that dark cloud of foreboding. I also felt weak, like I should be able to figure another way to fix my problem.But I learned that strength is in humility. In self awareness. And in seeking healing to be your best self. Zoloft brought me back. I wish you luck finding that peace.",Ssdd
18,Zoloft,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 30, 2021",7,"I have always been a worrier ever since I can remember. I believed I was going to stay this way my entire life until I was prescribed with Zoloft 50mg.Starting a full time job at 21, I used to constantly experience heart palpitations, I would ruminate constantly (day in and out), I began picking at my skin/nails. Life was absolutely exhausting for me. I saw a therapist who helped identify my anxiety triggers and I was given propranolol.These methods did help but not completely. My doctor started me on 25mg of sertraline and it increased my levels of anxiousness. Feeling hopeless I came across this page and read all your reviews and that gave me so much strength. I am currently on week 6 of Zoloft, taking 50mg. And l couldn’t be happier! I honestly feel like myself again, I can laugh at jokes now, I can rest easy and I’m not worrying at all anymore - it’s as if all the thoughts have been put on mute.Give it a go please, it’ll save your life",Esanj2
19,Zoloft,Depression,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 27, 2021",2,"I have a long history with Zoloft, mostly successful, with a couple of self-inflicted bumps in the road. I do have issues with weight, low libido and lethargy on this drug. I had been doing well on 25mg since December (after being on mostly 100mg the previous 20 years). Then some big stressors came my way in late July and my old major depression came back. Basically feeling paralyzed and unable to enjoy anything.  Back in December my dr had said I could increase to 50mg if necessary, so I started doing so on Aug 9. The depression had not abated by the time I saw the dr again on Sep 9. He recommended going up to 100mg until I felt better from the serotonin stabilizing. I had a breakthrough one week later (Sep 16) where I finally felt much better. But that lasted only a week and I started feeling bad again three days ago (Sep 25). So I’m just waiting for it to kick in again so I can hopefully go back down to 50mg.

For 3 years I had been trying so many medications. I had actually tried Zoloft before and it didn't work, but this time it has worked better than any other meds have. Just a month ago I had nearly attempted suicide again and I thought it was the end. Now I have more hope for the future and I am working on healing. Although it has made my memory a bit fuzzy and gave me headaches for a little while it is working. I do struggle a bit more with anxiety and insomnia, but my depression has improved and I finally went back to school. My flashbacks have eased off as well. Please be patient and try it!",Kylie

In the beginning I suffered from major depression and after trying a few drugs Zoloft was the only one that worked. After about 5 years on it I started getting panic attacks and severe anxiety attacks, feeling worse then ever. I found out from my doctor that been on it long term causes this, it’s part of the side affects. I stuck with it and got some counselling and it went away until recently. This time it was unbearable. Trying to come off them is absolutely horrible, I was so sick, I thought I might of had to check my set into a hospital.

I take both Abilify at 2 Mg and Zoloft at 50 Mg Daily. The first 12 days are pretty rough. The first week in particular i experienced plenty of side affect, the loss of appetite the numbness and just a general depressive state. Now on day 14 I'm starting to feel a general sense of returning to the person I used to be. A sense of confidence and pride have returned to me. I can't recommend it without the Abilify for me.

I had to go to a specialty pharmacy to get this dose.  I am very sensitive to medicine.First week:  Felt hopefulSecond week:  Felt slightly more depressedThird week:  Back to normalFourth week:  Slight improvement in moodFifth/sixth week:  Much betterSide effects:  None at allOther coping mechanisms:  Eating well, sleeping well, regular exercise, a therapist, a grief support group, a men's group, my dogs, talking about things with friends and family, staying open to my feelings.  Overall:  I am so happy I am taking this!  My story shows that starting on a very low dose (which I don't see a need to increase now) can bring great improvements without any side effects.  Hang in there!  It does take time but it works great after about a month or so.  And, work on your other coping mechanisms as well!  Love to all of you!",Sven

I am female (21) and I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and post traumatic stress disorder from a car crash. I read SO many reviews talking about their horrible crazy experiences so I was super scared to try this. I’m on 25mg of zoloft daily which I believe is the lowest dose. It has worked wonders for me. PLEASE GIVE IT A TRY. The first night I took it without food and I was up all night extremely nauseous with a crazy amount of energy. definitely take it in the morning. The only annoying side effects I've experienced are mild nausea if i take it without food and lower libido. This pill has changed my life and honestly saved my life. I am so much more productive and energetic, I no longer have racing thoughts and cry for hours every night. I feel like myself again, and I feel like my best self.

27,Zoloft,Depression,6.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 26, 2021",12,"I started taking this drug. In the first two weeks. I noticed a big change. I was happier than I had ever been. But as time went on. I was too happy. I started to think that maybe this happiness was a little too fake. My senses had become altered to where, I felt wasn't right. For example, this sounds bad, but this is what was happening to me. For example: if something really bad happened to someone I probably would laugh at that. Zoloft desensitized my brain into thinking I could do no wrong. That I was invincible. That scared me. And after I stopped taking it. And when it finally wore off. I could see that the drug was very dangerous to keep taking for me. In my experience I feel is was permanently damaging my brain. Because I couldn't think like I did before I started taking the drug. I could remember a lot of things before I took the drug. I've been having problems remembering anything after stopping the drug.   It worked way too well to be a miracle drug.

From my experience, I don’t suggest taking the two medications at the same EXACT time because the Zoloft kicked the Adderall into high gear for me but not in a good way. It led to increased anxiety/emotions and an intense feeling of uneasiness throughout my body especially in the initial stage of Zoloft/going through the purge. Eventually the side effects ceased and I even decided to stop taking it for a month because I thought I didn't feel the benefits to my anxiety. Now I’m back on it because I feel even worse off of it and I’m giving it some time.

Total time taking drugs (all prescription psych meds) is at least 10 to 15 years.  They might make the clouds roll away and make you feel so much better for a while, perhaps years, but they have the very real possibility of destroying your life.

38,Zoloft,Depression,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 12, 2021",7,I had just had a baby in June 2016. There were some up and downs post partum that were manageable. But in 2018 my relationship was suffering with my boyfriend and after turning 36 my emotions lost control. I was crying over things that were so little compared to things that would normally make me cry. I was so stressed out with work and feeling guilty all the time. I finally saw my primary doctor and could not explain without crying in front of her the anxiety I felt most days. She started me on Zoloft 25mg daily for 3 days and then 50mg daily from then on. After 2 months I felt a huge difference. No more crying and I felt more mellowed. My relationship ended with my boyfriend and I think that helped as well. It’s been 2 years on the Zoloft and I will continue because I do feel better than before. I will say that I ran out of pills and didn’t take them for 7 days.

39,Zoloft,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 2, 2021",38,"I have a lot of problems. Depression was one of my worst, I stayed in bed all day, cried most of the time, didn’t take care of myself etc. My psychiatrist prescribed me Zoloft and after a few weeks there was a noticeable difference! I was quite pleased, things seemed easier to do and I still have trouble with basic things but it’s much more manageable now. Like I can help myself whereas before I was just stuck. I take 200mg daily. One tip of advise I have for medications in general: You should feel something from them. You should notice a before and after (after giving it time to kick in of course). I’m not sure if this is just common knowledge but I wish someone had told me. I spent a lot of time taking medications in the past that did nothing for me but I thought surely they must be doing something.

It didn't do much for me, and I continued on a downward decline and experienced suicidal ideation and some of the worst anxiety of my life. It's unclear whether the medication sparked this, or if my dose was too low and it just failed to prevent this. Zoloft made me nauseous and I felt very ""meh"" while taking it.

I took Xanax at night just to help sleep but just bared through the day with nothing. I had lost 27 pounds in 5 weeks. I was beginning to think it wasn’t going to work.

The first two weeks were hard as I was very nauseous as I was adjusting from 25 mg to 50 mg but that went away after my body adjusted. Shortly after, I started experiencing emotional blunting and numbness which is something that I don't like because I am a very emotional person and I need to let a good cry out sometimes but on the medication I felt very numb. I also started experience extreme sexual side effects, which is VERY common for Zoloft so I decided to switch medications. Ultimately, the side effects were not worth it.",Nadine

I was living the life, amazing career and beautiful girlfriend, everything I could ask for. Then this hit and I was so deep into depression that I didn't want to continue anymore. Antidepressants were my last choice, and THANKFUL I did. I didn't want to get on them because I thought I was weak and couldn't get over it on my own. Symptoms were high depersonalization and feeling detached, hopelessness, isolation, etc. I thought it was over at age 24... but listen... It's not. I am living the best life now and have my dream job. Antidepressants do not make you weak. They make you brave and proud of yourself at the end of it. I have become a better person from all of this and you will too. Do not give up, because you will be back to normal. It took a good 6 - 8 months before they did their job.

I missed my 11am dosage and started feeling lots of anxiety so I took it at 8:30pm. Now I'm wondering if it will help me sleep at night and not be so tired during the day? Also worried the half life of the meds will be during the day and I'll feel like poo. Anyone have experience with switching from morning to night?",Mgm1234
86,Zoloft,Depression,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 9, 2019",15,"I started on Zoloft exactly 3 months ago. 25mg for two days, then 50mg for two days, then 75, then 100. I noticed a change immediately, likely due to placebo. My mood levelled out pretty quick once I hit 100 to a neutral place without the low low days. At 3 weeks I was scheduled to go up to 150mg (and did) and stayed on that dose for a month. Low mood crept back in gradually and then several days in a row. 2 weeks ago, I was upped to 200mg and at this point I am still waiting for it to really take effect. My doctor did mention it could take around 2 weeks. -Physical anxiety: (racing heart, trouble slowing breathing) 2.5 weeks, attributed to caffeine consumption- no longer can have more than 1 cup a day (coffee). -Exhaustion: 2 days at each dose increase. -Insomnia: whole time.

I’m a supervisor and it’s affecting my job duties. I feel like my critical thinking is gone. I’m going to be weaning myself off it because it’s not  good for my lifestyle.

I let go of things easier such as fights with partner and I don’t have horrible recurring thoughts. I still have had a total of about 8 bad days over the course of Zoloft but that is life!!

My depression was severe and depression as well as anxiety runs in my family. I know some people don't like medication and some people with less severe depression or anxiety might be able to do without it. Everyone is different. I have learned that depression is a disorder for some though because the mood chemicals like seratonin and dopamine just don't work accurately in the brain for some of us without medication. It can be similar to anemia where the body struggles  with lack of iron for the blood. If you need medication to get through don't feel bad because you can't control the chemicals in your own brain. I just worry about the possibilities of the system building a tolerance. Hopefully that wont happen though as it didn't with another medication I have taken for sixteen years for epilepsy.,Jay

A lot of reviews after taking one day, couple weeks etc. you need a full three months for maximum effectiveness. Not that it takes that long to start getting relief. Side effects are common while your body adjusts. Some of them will go away. I had no troublesome side effects with Zoloft. I always have to start out gradually. Maybe even more than they say bc I’m sensitive to meds. I got big relief from depression. Panic attacks went away. OCD went away. The cons are it made me not very motivated, felt kind of numb to strong feelings. Not feeling urgency about my life.  I wouldn’t take it again for years bc it blocked my clear perspective. But it was great to get me stabilized. Things  that really help but can’t completely replace anti dep is fish oil, vit d, exercise, sunlight, folate like spinach , lentils really good. Also diet really helps. Get a book called the good mood diet.  Best wishes",Louann

I started out at 25mg for a week and then 50mg and 100mg and 150mg and then 200mg over a 6 month period and have been there for 5 weeks. I think the medication helps, but you have to do more to really get back to normal. The drug helps keep more serotonin in your brain from what’s already in your body. You have to do more to really increase the serotonin levels in your body and your brain. Exercising helps for sure, but I finally figured out that caffeine and alcohol weren’t helping and had to mostly eliminate consumption of those. I read where they actually deplete your serotonin. Recently the drug really helped change my thought process, which was really warped by the anxiety/depression. It’s amazing how they can really alter your perception of reality.

I got insomnia, I started to shake uncontrallably, I started to have major anger issues. It was just too much for me, so when I went to the psychiatrist, he evaluated me and said I had Chronic Depression and changed my medications to Paroxetine.

As a thirty-something, in-shape mother of two, I have zero time for naps so, fatigue was not a livable option for me. I'm actually really surprised by the weight gain as I hit the gym daily.

I have learned through my journey that other people's experiences of these kinds of meds are no real indication of how it will be for you personally. But sometimes it helps to share. Just take everything with a grain of salt. Zoloft negatives: constant yawning, first three days you feel so unwell you think you'll never be ok again.  Also, inability to have an orgasm, which lasted about three months and then I was fine. Serious vertigo that got so bad I had to stop taking it.

Let me start off by saying that this drug, literally, saved my LIFE. I've always battled anxiety and panic attacks, and was on a small dose of Paxil and that seemed to take the edge off. I took it on and off for years. After I had my second baby at 28, I got terrible postpartum depression. I had thoughts of suicide, racing thought constantly, couldn't nap and took forever to fall asleep at night. I literally spent three months just thinking and obsessing over how horrible I felt. I wanted to crawl out of my skin and die. I was barely showering, brushing my teeth and hair and would stay in the same sweatpants and shirt for days. I could go on forever by I'll get to the point. After three months of pure hell, I went to my doctor for help. I was prescribed 50 ML of Zoloft. After being on it for 4 weeks, I stopped taking it because it wasn't working. After going another 2 weeks feeling miserable, I went to my doctor again.  She recommended we up the dose and stay on it for atleast 6 weeks. Well, after two weeks on 100 ML, I realized I was feeling better. I would go minutes without thinking negatively, then I would go hours, then full days. It feels SO good to feel like myself again. I truly thought I would be miserable forever. Please get help and try something if you are feeling terrible. Everyone is curable with the right drug and right dose. I wish I got help sooner. TRY THIS! It will work! If for some reason it doesn't, try something else! GET HELP NOW!

My sleep schedule was normal, people said I was friendlier, and I had consistent appetite for healthy food.Cons: this drug took away my ability to have intimacy and perform any kind of exercise other than simple running on a treadmill. I could not play sports with any of my friends, because I would get lightheaded and faint, especially in the heat. I could not have a complete orgasm, and so that pretty much ruined sex for me.In summary, it treated several of my depression symptoms, but the things I had to give up due to side effects were not worth it.

The side effects I have had are reduced libido and slightly reduced appetite.

The mistake that I have made and others make far too often is to quit the meds once you feel better. If you feel bad before you find the right med that makes you feel better, then you should keep in mind that it is the med that's working. If it's working, stay on it. If you have been diagnosed. With ADHD or Bipolar, or a combination like many have, it's probably not going away...it's there to stay.

I used to cry for no reason (even at work), snap at my partner for stupid things, i was paranoid over everything, socially scared (always wanted to stay home). I haven't cried since being on Zoloft, nor snap at my partner. I am a new person now. I'm so happy and look forward to my new life.  100/100.",I love Zoloft

It did help, but this time not nearly as much. It lifted my mood and helped me have less mood swings. It barely touched my anxiety and agoraphobia, plus this time around the sexual side effects were devastating. The effort it took to have an orgasm was unbelievable!

This is a wonderful medicine for me. I have found that the brand name works better on me than the generic brand. I know they aren't supposed to be different but they are. On the generic I have suicidal thoughts which I didn't have before I started on the medicine. On the brand name, I don't have this issues and feel so much better. I like myself and other people like me better too.",ssoileau26

583,Zoloft,Depression,8.0,,"October 15, 2008",367,I'm writing this post because I spent a lot of time researching online about zoloft side effects before I finally decided to try it for my OCD/depression.  I made a mental note to let other people considering this drug know what it was like after I tried it as well.  I was worried that it might cause weight gain and that there may be sexual side effects.  I was on this medication for 2 years and DID NOT experience weight gain or sexual side effects.  The first few months I was on it I had some stomach upset and trouble sleeping but that disappeared shortly after.  I have maintained a consistent body weight (within 5 lbs.) for years and zoloft did not seem to affect my weight at all.  I lost a few pounds at first because of the stomach upset,piano
584,Zoloft,Depression,6.0,,"August 24, 2008",99,"I've been taking this medication for almost two years. Since on it, I've become a completely different person. I am so happy to be me. The only problems with it that I am starting to realize is that I grind my teeth at night and I've gained 10 pounds since starting it. I exercise and eat right too. It's a constant struggle just to lose a few pounds. Then again some people lose weight on it and some people notice no change in their weight.",Anonymous
585,Zoloft,Depression,9.0,,"August 18, 2008",50,Been on Zoloft since '94 (200mg).  Side effects are minimal other than grinding my teeth at night. On the upside - it never effected my sex drive.  ,DsBrt
586,Zoloft,Depression,9.0,,"August 13, 2008",20,It works very well at first but I seem to have gotten used to it very fast. After about 3 months I'm already on the max dose of 300mg.,Stacy365

Prior to starting the medicine, I was anxious all the time, worried constantly about everything, and suffered periods of depression and hopelessness.  Now I am a better wife, friend, and person in general.",Anonymous
588,Zoloft,Depression,10.0,,"July 31, 2008",1408,"I remember reading people's opinions, online, of the drug before I took it and it scared me away from it. Then I finally decided to give it a try and it has been the best choice I have made. I have been on it for over 4 months and I feel great. I'm on 100mg and I don't have any side effects. When I first started I did notice that my hands would tremble but then it subsided. So honestly, don't listen to all the negativity because what doesn't work for some works amazing for others. So go based on youself and not everyone else. It may be a blessing in diguise. The pill is not meant to make you be all happy go lucky and see ""butterflies and roses"", its meant to help put the chemicals in your mind in balance so you can just be who you are and not overly depressed. I still get sad some times, but that is normal, that is life, and it's up to people to take control to make a change. I did so by getting on this pill.",wbb

The side effects were less servere than any other med I've tried today, the only downside was that after awhile I noticed it stopped working and I was increasing my dosage more frequently. I started on 25mg and worked up to 200-250mg.",lkn249

So far, the panic is gone, and my depression has similarly been suppressed.  The only problem seems to be the side effects.  I can't really eat that much anymore, and have succeeded in losing a fair amount of weight.  I also have the ""shakes"" where my hands tremble. Though, as other people have said, the effectiveness of the medicine outweighs the side effects.",torihime

I still feel emotion, but my uncontrollable outbursts ended. I can't seem to loose weight, but who knows if it is related to the Zoloft.
