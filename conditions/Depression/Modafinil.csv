1,Modafinil,Depression,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 23, 2022",0,"I have found with NDRI drugs like methylphenidate and drugs like modafinil to induce depression, as someone with Dyslexia and ADHD what I find is that the normal sense of euphoria I gain from normal things like listening to music and just generally being alive is gone which induces a state of depression and suicidal thoughts. I am not finding much on this effect though and I am wondering if its mainly due to dopamine reuptake inhibitors causing the issue entirely. Perhaps my issue is not the lack of dopamine but the conversion of tyrosine into dopamine, I have no idea and I wish I knew because 100mg (200mg+ makes this worse) is very effective for ADHD and Hypersomnia.",Suit
2,Modafinil,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 22, 2021",6,"I was actually having shift work sleepiness and so I went to my sleep doctor who after ordering a sleep study also added Modafinil cos I was always sleeping and feeling tired during the day. After taking Modafinil for three days I noticed something very interesting, I was no longer sad or anhedonic I felt enthusiastic and had increased self efficacy. Those things that usually made me sad didn’t affect me after taking Modafinil.  So I did a test and did not take my Modafinil for 2 days and that’s when I noticed how great this drug really is… I’m so glad I found this drug",Gabe

Small tasks in life, to say nothing of some if the less pleasurable  tasks at work, seemed overwhelming, so I would simply not do then, but not anymore. Interactions with superiors are a lot smoother.  My psychiatrist initially prescribed modafinil a a drug to help this stop using cocaine,  and it is working. When I saw him the other I said, where has this medicine been all my life? So far all effects seem positive. At least for me. Used online coupons to get a month’s supply for ~$25. However prices vary widely eve. With coupons  by pharmacy, from the price I pay to several hundred dollars a month.

I can't detect any side effects unless I have to take it with my asthma inhaler as then it can cause shakiness, nervousness, sleeplessness, etc. Otherwise it's a great product!

I have been put trough the ringer of all the traditional antidepressant classes.  I've tried two SSRI's, three SNRI's, several different atypical antipsychotics, Remeron,  Lamictal, and Wellbutrin XL.  I'm a man and have had terrible sexual side effects with antidepressants.  Recently I was diagnosed with treatment resistant depression, and I said I need something new. My psychiatrist suggested Provigil, since it is less likely than other stimulants to worsen high blood pressure.  It has been a godsend for my depression.  I have energy, intense focus and have been doing much better in my college courses.  Long work shifts that used to drag on forever now seem to fly by.  I am more patient and outgoing than I have ever been.  Now I just take this and Wellbutrin XL.  Definitely recommend.  Should be used much more frequently for refractory depression.

I do not feel like doing anything. I am also diagnosed with anhedonia and PTSD.   The main idea I want to get across is that on the day I took the Provigil and felt so horrible about twelve hours later I had a two-hour window of feeling ""normal"" I did not feel depressed at all and I actually wanted to play solitaire. I cannot tell you what a huge difference this was as my natural state is being in so deep a depression it is hard to make it from one moment to the next.  I want so badly to feel like I did in that two-hour window and I want to know if it was the Provigil that caused it.

Also the AD's often cause sleepiness. Modafinil does what it says it does. It keeps you awake/alert and combats AD induced fatigue/tiredness. I'd question if it makes you 'smarter'. For me (83kg, male, 27 YO) at 100mg it is a mild keep me awake. At 150 it's perfect. At 200mg it's stimulating, alerting and induces mild hypomania (Which is okay but I feel slightly too 'buzzed' at 200mg).

The Bupropion alone was not helping somatic symptoms and the Gabapentin solved that.  The added Modafinil caused no noticeable side effects.   It did provide increased energy, a more positive mood, emotional stability, and a feeling of cheerfulness which was foreign to me.

I have tried other options like Wellbutrin, RITALIN but with erratic results, you should try modafinil and you would be surprised.",omchanti
51,Modafinil,Depression,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 5, 2014",51,"I selected depression but at this point I believe depression is a side effect to a larger Neurological issue and apnea. I was diagnosed with Depression years ago and after being put on tonnes of different medicines some of which were a nightmare I was upgraded to Bi-Polar. Along the way I gained about 100lbs and eventually ended up on a cocktail that included Seroquel which made me very sleepy all the time. I was initially given Provigil as a way to be awake during the day. It was a very positive improvement. After a while I was adjusted to Seroquel, Lamictal and Provigil, and it seemed to keep me stable but still lethargic. Eventually we tried lessening the Seroquel and eventually eliminated it. I am doing better than ever now for several years.",D.M.N.
52,Modafinil,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 31, 2013",26,"My depression is responsible for a sleeping disorder that makes it very hard for me to stay awake and functional: I have some kind of hypersomnia instead of the regular insomnia complaints patients have. Even though there are people that respond nicely to modafinil, I didn't feel anything while associating 200mg of it to my SSRI. I couldn't notice any improvement to my sleeping cycle or to my concentration. Side effects were absent too. Unfortunately it was not for me.",Fernanda P
53,Modafinil,Depression,9.0,,"September 11, 2013",60,"Had this added to my anti-depressant cocktail and I have to admit, it's given me more energy and increased my mood quite a bit. I was really surprised at it's effectiveness for depression and depression related fatigue. The only drawback for me is that I often get headaches when it starts to wear off. But overall a good medicine!",Suze1227
54,Modafinil,Depression,10.0,,"February 19, 2013",70,"I selected ""depression"" but this medicine has been beneficial for fatigue and hypersomnia as well.  Started using this medicine in 2006! Yes, and I have tried almost everything else for depression, and I cannot say the side-effects or results from so-called approved depression medications were ever worth the horror they delivered. So, yes, I would recommend this for depression in the form of modafinil.",Modalert User
55,Modafinil,Depression,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 14, 2012",98,"Provigil was added to my meds for depression.  I love it!  Modafinil has made more of a difference than anything I've ever been given.  I can concentrate now and actually have more get up and go than I've had in years.  I take 100 mg everyday.  Tried 200 mg, but feel just fine with 100 mg.",hellogal
56,Modafinil,Depression,10.0,,"March 9, 2012",123,"I read the experiences of people on Provigil before I tried it and as I was in the midst of a very deep depression and has tried so many other anti-depressants. I was suicidal and desperate for help.  As most other people found, it is a miracle!  I cannot believe that I feel this good.  I am back to my old positive self.  I am taking 200 mgm in the morning.  The last medicine that worked was Adderall which worked initially but wore off after a year.  I still had the rapid heart beat, but the depression continued.  Thank you to everyone who posted their positive feedback as it gave me hope that the medicine might work. This is an off label use, but it sure works for me!",sgc46

58,Modafinil,Depression,6.0,,"March 3, 2010",56,"Provigil (modafinil):I was initially prescribed this medication to address both a mild sleep apnea problem and persistent depression.  Initially, it was indeed like a miracle drug.  I felt better immediately and continued so for about a year.  However, the drug then quickly became less effective and actually began to make my depression much worse.  I very briefly switched to Nuvigil, but I continued with the worsening depression and ended up having to stop the medication.  Within a few days of discontinuing the medication, I felt considerably better.  I went on to other medications to help with the depression and fatigue.  Provigil/Nuvigil has been a blessing for many people.  However, as with many medications, their continued use can sometimes backfire.",Anonymous
59,Modafinil,Depression,10.0,,"January 6, 2010",84,"Provigil (modafinil):Provigil has been a HUGE help for me. I take nortriptyline for my depression. It works better than anything else I've tried but it makes it impossible for me to get up in the morning. When my alarm goes off at 7am I feel like I'm being tortured. I take half a tablet of Provigil at bedtime (11pm). It doesn't keep me from falling asleep but it does help me wake up alert at 7am. Without it, I'll sleep until at least 11:30am. This may be an off-label use but it makes it possible for me to take my antidepressant AND get to school/work on time.",Anonymous

I have suffered for years with depression and never with any relief from the mainstream anti-depressants. Either the side effects were intolerable, or the medicine just didn't work. Within 3 days of taking Provigil, I was the happiest, most productive I had been in a year. The first 2 days I was still really sleepy, and the 3rd day, a little hyper, but after that day I have felt EXCELLENT. I don't have anxiety attacks anymore and I get a full night of ""good"" sleep and wake up feeling extremely refreshed and I am happy again. I was on my couch for a straight 6 months sleeping and crying until I started this medicine. It literally saved my life.",jaguiar
