And I was so absentminded that I forgot to put the gas cap back on after I refueled my car. I stopped taking it at that point. I think the side effects outweigh the benefits.",Betty D.

Ever since I started the quetiapine, even on the half doses, I go to sleep, granted I go quicker than before, but I wake up mid REM cycle, about 3 hours later, due to vivid nightmares. I wake up unreasonably paranoid, thinking that something is in my room with me, whether it be spiders, another person, a monster, anything. I wake up with my heart pounding and I can't go back to sleep until I have searched my room to sate the paranoia. I have never had dreams like this before and I have never experienced these paranoid spells in my life and honestly, my sleeping was better off without this medication.

7,Quetiapine,Depression,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 20, 2021",0,"The psychiatrist at the crisis hospital put me on quetiapine for my depression. She said that although it’s an antipsychotic (I’ve never had any psychosis symptoms) it would work with my mirtazapine (which only improves my sleep, and has no effect on my mental health).It had no benefits at all, only side effects. My movements became even slower, my coordination worsened, my PoTS symptoms got worse (now tingling in my face, pain around my eyes and temporarily losing vision; as well as the lightheadedness, dizziness, vision disturbances, and rapid heart rate I had before). I was asked every few days how the medication was going and I reported this each time.After 2 weeks another doctor saw the notes and took me off it immediately.I have ADHD, and this medication does basically the opposite of what ADHD meds do. The psychiatrist told me quetiapine can treat ADHD instead of the actual ADHD meds I need. I couldn’t find evidence of that.",Cass

And I've taken every SSRI under the sun, valium, clonidine, gabapentin, and vistaril all in the past. This medication is a life saver. It does make me feel drowsy 3-4 hours after taking it so it should be taken around dinner time. My doc first started me on it first thing in the morning and I was dozing off by noon. But other than that it has been a lifesaver. Almost no anxiety, I sleep better, my appetite is good, my mood is good & confident. For me it even helps to relax my muscles. I'm so glad my doc took a chance and prescribed this medication off-label for my anxiety. It has given me a new lease on life.",Dan
9,Quetiapine,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 17, 2021",4,"Listen to what your Psychiatrist says, ask tons of questions but remember, it's YOU taking this medication and not your Psychiatrist.  A lot of experimenting is needed before getting a cocktail which works.  I'm on 5mg fluoxetine morning, 30mg paroxetine morning, and 150mg of quetiapine at night. (Prozac, Paxil, Seroquel)  I was on Mirtazapine also but have let go of that.  Results are promising.  Very little sleepiness from the quetiapine... serum levels peak 90 minutes after taking... but there is a choice to sleep or not.  It's no knock out pill.  The method of chemistry with quetiapine is to slow the transmission of neuro-transmitters, so keeps the good stuff in the brain for a while longer, just titrering along.  At least this is the construct from the medicos and chemists.  It's all black magic. Quetiapine like many other drugs started life as an antihistamine.  That's a side benefit of taking it... you can vacuum without a mask. :)",GregoryJ

It takes a few weeks to work like it should but you will feel some relief in about 5 days. you will sleep soundly and wake up rested it is a strong sedative. I feel that sleep relates to depression and anxiety. I have experienced zero weight gain I'm lucky I guess. You will wake up sedated but it goes away in about 30 min but I also take a stimulant, so that might be part of it, but I also wake up happy and ready for the day.

I've tried multiple antidepressant before, and none of them worked for me. My doctor prescribed me 50 mg of Seroquel XR, and I take it before going to sleep. I have now been taking it for 3 months, and it literally saved my life. I've experienced some side effects at first, but now that my body is used to the medication, I feel so much better. I can go out, see friends, and do a lot of things I couldn't even think about doing 2 months ago. In contrary to a lot of people, I didn't gain weight yet, I even lost some. It also helps my mood swings and my dissociation. The only negative thing I can think of is the tiredness. But, if I get out of bed right away, I'm good for the day. I can recommend to not take it too late, because it can make it hard to wake up in the morning.

The positives; -not only is it anti-depressive for me, but it also allivate my mood over my ""normal"" not-depressant mood. - works very good for social anxiety for me(although in average this has not been seen in trials).Negative; makes me tired the first 3 hours of the day, which is not trivial.(English is my second language, I rarely write it, so the spelling is probably not great.)",Mr.quetiapine

I stopped having nightmares/ I haven’t had sleep paralysis since I started. My mood is also significantly better. I have strong laughter and I cry in reaction to things (like a sad movie) in a way that feels healthy. I used to either not cry at all for months or cry by myself for hours.

Taken me 5 days to work out I must have it at 6 pm for it to work(apparently the affect takes 2-3 hours to come on) and to not be groggy until midday the following day (awful). Since taking it I have noticed a slight increase in depression. Then today bang, anxiety back although it was quite short lived. Someone on here mentioned the bounce back effect, which I’m beginning to see is happening with this drug, the same as Ativan did... just makes depression and anxiety worse. Psych seems to think it’s not addictive either. I really don’t agree with that. How can something that puts you to sleep so nicely ever not be a choice over insomnia. I think I’m going to stop taking it as much as it helps my sleep. Can’t risk having depression and anxiety be any worse. This is a very heavy drug. I’m quite surprised she subscribed it so easily.

What I like about this medicine is that I can have kind of 3D dreams and I can sleep normally, but what I dislike is that I have low libido and that's why my boyfriend thinks that something is wrong with him (even when I say that it is just a side effect of medicines I have to take). It just seems for me like ""must to do"" action without any passion. And it is strange because I was very different before with great sex drive.",Little_Baby_Nothing
