0,Prozac,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 28, 2022",0,"Honestly was taking 80MG of Prozac for years, felt so much better than decided to ween off and stop after years of taking. Biggest mistake ever, if your reading this please ask your Dr before deciding your OK  and want to try life without  medication. Since Prozac having a very long half life  about 5 to 6 days and took almost one year for my depression turned into major depression. My life was in a crisis and I couldn't stand everything and couldn't deal with life on life's terms. A shrink told me I was very depression which shocked",Male Adult Drum
1,Prozac,Depression,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 3, 2022",2,"I was prescribed this first before I started my ADHD meds. I have been on SSRIs before. I don't really respond to them, good or bad. The only positive I noted during my time on this medication was less frequent/repetitive thoughts and more indifference to things. I was only 5mg for 1 year. I couldn't take 10mg because I am sensitive to medication and even 5mg gave me the side effects I will discuss below. Insomnia: I could not sleep. I had to be prescribed sleep medication while on Prozac. I used to be able to fall asleep fine, even if I was depressed, I would rather sleep than not. I would get maybe 6 hours and then wake up with energy and I didn't like it. I always felt like my body was secretly tired if my mind would just let it be. Headaches, teeth grinding made worse, and in turn, neck pain, shoulder pain. Less appetite, no weight loss or gain. Vivid dreams, some violent in the beginning. Weird digestion. Felt on edge at times. My nose is no longer stuffy either so allergies?",JoJo
2,Prozac,Depression,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 31, 2022",15,"Hello, I wanted to share my experience because when I was in the thick of my depression and reluctantly decided to try antidepressants, I was absolutely terrified and it was reading reviews on here that really helped me stick it out and have hope for a better future. Prozac/Fluoxetine has honestly changed my life. In the best way ever. I had so many symptoms that I thought were just personality traits that I can see now was actually my anxiety and depression. I used to worry so much about everything and had terrible insomnia because of it. I was completely reliant on sleep aids and was always overwhelmed with work so much that I was taking sick days very regularly. Prozac did take about 8 weeks to start working for me. So you do need to be very patient. But I feel so much better now. I don’t feel any different, just think clearer and no longer sweat the small things. If you’re struggling, please don’t be scared. It might be the best decision you make.",Coolasacucumber

4,Prozac,Depression,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 2, 2022",10,"Hi guys ,  I have depression, OCD and anxiety.  I am  a 42 years old man married with kids and have struggled with depression all my life and  I've been on and off meds during different periods. During the last year I took zoloft 200mg  for several months, it helped with anxiety but made me sleep too much. My doctor switched me to prozac 40mg in the morning which I've been on for about 6 months now. I felt a bit less tired and foggy. It definitely ended my panic attacks and anxiety but I still feel sluggish and struggle to get things done in and out of the home. If you have panic attacks and anxiety with depression this could help you. I appreciate the positive influence it has had on my state of mind but I still feel like I'm tired and struggling to be productive at work.",justin

6,Prozac,Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 12, 2021",7,It took a full 7 weeks to have any tangible result. In fact the first few weeks were tormented but my GP told me to carry on with it come hell or high water.  I did actually quit taking it initially but tried again through desperation. Made me feel extremely anxious and panicky in the beginning but I found the tool of mindful meditation to be an excellent antidote to panic. I didn't believe prozac would have any effect but I now find it very helpful indeed. I also got rid of the stressors in my life (poor job fit and bad relationship) and learnt how not to ruminate. I had a small amount of alcohol once after the 3 week and it made me feel very ill on Prozac so I have stopped drinking beer. I have tried other ADs before but couldn't stomach the side effects and I have to admit that I had to swallow my pride before swallowing Prozac as I used to think depression was for weaklings when in fact it is rather the opposite kind of people who suffer from it.,David N

Now that I finally have... HOLY MOLY This is what normal feels like. I was so used to living in fear that I started believing that it was just normal and would never change. I am so thankful for Prozac. I can't even believe it.Oddly enough though, 20MG 1x daily made me feel nothing (possibly even worse than before). Within days of upping my dose to 40MG x1 daily, my life changed dramatically. I am no longer an anti medicine advocate. I put up with so much suffering for so long.

12,Prozac,Depression,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 21, 2021",24,"I can’t believe it how Prozac changed my life.I’m on 20 mg.I have been suffering from anxiety and depression all my life, especially these last two years dealing with divorce and death. I was at the point that I lost control of myself and feared how am I supposed to go to work. I had suicidal thoughts and so much intrusive thoughts, events form the past, people who did me wrong , conversations from random people, who I had not seen for 25 years,  I was terrified when these thoughts were entering. Now, Everything is at ease, when thoughts enter I don’t get scared, I don’t even pay attention to them that much, I’m calm and energetic. I go to work happy and feel like I’m born again.The only concern I have is my libido that has dropped but that won’t  matter at this time,  my priority is to focus on curing the depression and am optimistic that it will come back.

13,Prozac,Depression,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 21, 2021",1,"My father is 88 years old and was taking prozac.  He suffered heart failure and basically fell apart mentally from the diagnosis.  He was given prozac because he was repeatedly asking anyone involved in his rehab to finish him off.  Prozac stopped that issue, but that were no more changes after taking it a few more weeks.  My father slept all day if I gave him 20mg of prozac, so I cut the dose in to 10 mg so he could talk to visiting nurses.  After weeks of using prozac, he is still a mess, but less of a mess.  We are now using mirtazapine.   He is no longer using prozac, so he is experiencing lots of fatigue for the last two weeks of withdrawal. Apparently medical science can only throw various drugs at mental illness patients in an effort to see what helps",Todd
14,Prozac,Depression,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 2, 2021",33,"After taking Prozac for 23 years I decided to stop after I took early retirement thinking that a new way of life and no stress would mean I’d be ok. I spoke to the doctor and tapered off over three months.  Since then I have had various physical symptoms and in the last six weeks I have had a relapse of my depression accompanied by anxiety. I went back on the Prozac three weeks ago. 20mg dose every other day, now upped to every day in the last few days.  I’ve got the shakes which and I don’t want to go out or see anyone at the moment.  I know all this will ease. My point is that while I was taking Prozac I led a normal happy life.  I can’t wait to get back to that. I would say to anyone out there just do it.  Yes the first few weeks can be hard going but once your body adjusts you get your life back. As one reviewer said if you were diabetic you’d take meds to control your condition. There’s no shame in it.  Life’s too short to struggle all of the time.",Healing
15,Prozac,Depression,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 22, 2021",3,"I was prescribed Prozac by my doctor who was treating me for a broken jaw after a tragic accident.  I was depressed, suicidal and grief stricken from the incident.  This was in 1998.  The doctor said she was given trial packs to give out and she wanted to hear my feedback.  The first night I took one, it caused me to black out for at least eighteen hours straight and I was in some type of comatose state.  When I woke up, I didn't remember who I was, what day or anything. It took hours of laying in bed with amnesia to think hard enough to rediscover myself.  The doctor called and said I could have had a stroke and died and to never take that medication again.  Nobody has ever been able to explain why this happened to me.  And I have never heard of it happening to anyone else.  I lost all faith in psychotropic drugs!",Lisa

I've been on 20mg Prozac for 2 months and I must say it made me feel worse than before, I had high anxiety, I couldn't leave my house and most of the days I have spent in bed. On weeks 7-8 I literally thought I will come off this medication but I waited and seen my doctor, we have increased the dose to 40mg (2 tablets a day) It has been 2 weeks now and I must say I feel such a change. I am able to think again, I go to bed smiling and did not spend a single day in bed. I feel more comfortable doing the house chores, it doesn't seem impossible anymore. Not sure if it works for everyone, but it's worth the wait. Seems like the 20mg just weren't enough for me, 40mg changed my life so far.

I smile when I feel the rain or a breeze. The little things that matter most. I feel everything again.

It was funny and  annoying. Lasted 3 hours. Was super irritable then for about 3 hours. I feel depressed and tired still but at same time I got up and did housework and enjoyed it. I NEVER do this. Like I was organizing stuff and being all efficient. It's been YEARS since I was like that. It's too soon for this stuff to work isn't it?

I took my first 20mg pill in the morning and that entire day I felt awful. I was so exhausted, felt ""high"", couldn't think, felt sedated and my anxiety was through the roof. The next day I decided to reduce my dosage in half. I split the pill and took just 10mg that morning. I felt so much better. I had energy throughout the day without overwhelming tiredness or sedation. I have been taking 10mg since then and continously feel better and better. I was extremely scared of starting a medication like this but I do not regret it now. I have started feeling real things again. I'm feeling emotions instead of mimicking them when I am suppose to. I have snapped a lot less. I am much calmer and a lot more patient. I have more energy. I just expect to keep getting better from here!

28,Prozac,Depression,7.0,,"January 12, 2021",9,"I tried every other available antidepressant the doctor could get his hands on before we landed on this one. The others either worked, but gave me terrible diarrhoea or they had no effect at all. Although I felt a little better right away, for the first few weeks I had pretty bad mood swings which made me really quite horrible to be around. The smallest things would set me off and I would blow up. I wasn’t known for mood swings like this prior to taking the pills. The mood swings went away and since then I haven’t noticed any side effects whatsoever. In my experience what this drug does is it makes my depression just a little bit more tolerable. I still feel terrible from time to time, and seemingly for no good reason, but it happens a little less and usually with less intensity. I feel just a bit lighter.",Enzyme

Before I was on Seroquel XR & that was terrible bc that made me feel so strange all the time. I finally got off of that & tried Prozac because I’ve always dealt with OCD & Intrusive thoughts. I cannot express how true every review is about the first couple weeks, 3-4 you won’t feel anything really, honesty my anxiety was a little stronger, but trust me when I tell you it is all well worth it. I honestly feel amazing now, I can just think better & more clearly & now I understand my intrusive thoughts are only thoughts, they aren’t my actions. Man I used to fight with my thoughts all the time & ask why did I think that, why did I think this, now I understand so much more about myself & who I am & who I want to be.

32,Prozac,Depression,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 8, 2020",7,"I didn't really like this medication Prozac. I was on a very similar medication before this one, called Escitalopram and it gave me horrible side effects. I noticed that my depression and anxiety got much worse while on Escitalopram, and nothing got better, rather things got WORSE after switching to Prozac. I was super annoyed because I was hoping this would be THE one that would help me, but it did nothing for me. It gave me really intense heart palpitations while on it, and I still get them till this day. Not as often, but I still get them. (Although that could be my chronic stress + GAD)Overall, I'd give this med a 2 out of 10. It did actually improve my mood temporarily, then sent me crashing down into a spiral. I almost attempted suicide. I have since been switched to Quetiapine 50mg, since my doctors think the adverse reaction to the SSRI's could be me having bipolar.

Early side effects were appetite loss, a slight increase in breakouts (face), excessive yawning, desire for alcohol decreased but increased interest in recreational mari, stomach upset, headaches. Sounds like a lot but every med has its acclimation period. This one is just particularly long. After about 2 months, it helped me recognize and face my depression, and manage my anxiety really well.

Initially I felt a better, my family and partner agreed that this is the best medicine for me and that I was doing great. I felt hopeful but not certain. I have now changed to a new antidepressant as I was had side effects -very sore eyes, muscle pains, shaking hands, no interest nor  motivation to do anything I usually would. I even had anxiety seeing my closest friends and I would lay in bed all day up to 6pm, I stopped cleaning, cooking and taking care of myself and didn’t want to eat. The only time I would force myself to get up is to go to work as I did not want to loose my job. Has anyone else has this experience I truly feel worries that my mood is down a lot and that my motivation is gone especially not feeling like moving out of bed.

I have been on Prozac for almost 4 years now, in various doses depending on the intensity of my depression, and my mood/behavior has immensely improved since. The first time I attempted suicide they put me on 10 mg in the psychiatric facility. After three days of the Prozac, the horrible thoughts completely silenced. I woke up in the morning.. happy?! I felt a real smile. I could finally laugh and feel real joy out of human interaction. There were zero intrusive thoughts. I went up to 30 mg and then 40 mg after a few months,  which I am still taking to this day. I have tried to come off of Prozac and unfortunately I am just not ready. Which is okay! Prozac has been such a wonderful option for me. It feels great not wanting to hurt yourself all of the time. I can’t remember the last time I had suicidal thoughts.

I'm a little jittery, but I attribute that to a new exercise program I'm using as another part of the solution. The feeling I get about an hour after taking the pill is a sense of peace. The world appears a little brighter, and my tunnel vision subsides and the negative thoughts go mostly silent. I still have my spark while taking this drug too, which means I still have a sense of humor and can plan for the future. I still care about things, which is cool.

The thoughts and problems that usually fill in my head don't affect me as much anymore and I get over things much quicker, which has led to decreasing my stress and my severe anxiety. I've also felt very calm and mellow, which could turn some people off but for me it has been a blessing. I've always not been able to stay still or focus, and am very scatterbrained, so this is a huge change that I've welcomed.

My story - in short - is anxiety has plagued me since my teens, depression joined the parade in my late teens/early 20's. I have tried several medications over the years and because they either made me flat or sick I didn't stick with them. Recently decided Prozac would be my last attempt.I started taking 20 mg every morning 2 weeks ago. I have had very little in the way of side effects. Some mind shakiness in the morning, little bit of difficulty falling asleep, mild fatigue, and dampened appetite. The benefits - to this point - are - surprising. I am much calmer, the anxiety is 80% gone, the depression is still present but not like 2 weeks ago and before. It's dissipating for sure. Life doesn't look so ""all or nothing"" which is a nice change.My spouse said my ""fidgets"" are gone. I was almost constantly moving in some form or another.I know some people think the medication reaction is ""all in ones head"" but since my problems ARE all in my head - I don't care if it's the medication, me thinking it is or a combination. All I can say is, for the first time in a very, very long time I am able to run errands, be more social and have actually gotten a full time job in the past 2 weeks. I am able to better care for myself now thus able to care better for my spouse.I have no plans to stop the Prozac. With 20 mg/once a day being a low dose and with it helping to this point, I'm going to roll with this as long as I can.",CLWW

I didn't feel so depressed, but I didn't feel happy either. I don't think it was all that effective at combating my depression. They kept increasing the dosage to see if more would work better, but it got to the point where the dose would be toxic for my body size so I was switched to a different drug. I am now 20, off all medications and have never felt better.",Anonymous
401,Prozac,Depression,2.0,,"July 21, 2009",13,"I took this with bupropion.  I stopped bupropion, because I was so edgy and irritable. It was suggested I wait for Prozac to take full effect in about 1 month. I stopped Prozac last night after a week of it alone.  I was edgy, irritable, and didn't feel like doing productive things like care about my job, or care about studying on investing choices. I just wanted to take a nap to relieve the buzzing in my head.  Today I am not taking anything.  I feel better than yesterday. ",xina
402,Prozac,Depression,7.0,,"July 16, 2009",25,"I was on 30mg Prozac daily for stress/anxiety/depression after having an eating disorder for 6  years and felt after 1 year I hit a plateau and weaned myself off of it.  When I missed a dose I definitely felt the anxiety creep back and depression set it, but got sick of feeling numb with no emotions and unable to cry even when I wanted to.  I however; after being off of it for a year and trying it again because I know I didn't gain weight on it which was my biggest fear. I am afraid to try another medicine and frankly don't feel like going through the weeks you have to wait to see if they work.  I know I liked Prozac in all when I was on it and just hope the plateau I felt is gone.  ",star1234

404,Prozac,Depression,2.0,,"May 8, 2009",24,"I have depression. Prozac did not help me. After 4 weeks and several side effects, the only positive experience was the fact that I didn't feel anything ""bad"" or ""good"". The worst was the major lack of motivation and loss of all interest in what I enjoyed in life. That was kind of the problem before the medicine. This is my second day off Prozac and I feel better each day. Good luck all.",My experience

407,Prozac,Depression,10.0,,"April 12, 2009",149,I took Prozac for several years to treat my depression and it was awesome. It had few side effects but gave me my life back. I went from not leaving my bed to actually being a productive member of society again. I did lose a good deal of weight while I was on it but that eventually balanced out.  I took it until it got to the point where it stopped working for me and I've never found anything that has worked as well.  Hopefully I will be able to take it and have it work for me again one day.,Anonymous
