0,Tramadol,Depression,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 23, 2022",0,"I'm 64 and have suffered from depression most of my adult life, and during that time have tried just about every antidepressant available through several doctors.  Tramadol, which I discovered by accident when it was prescribed for pain relief from an inguinal hernia, has been by far the most effective.  I'm fortunate to live in Thailand where I can buy it over the counter, sadly it has now been classified as a narcotic in the US. (Probably the FDA protecting the drug companies selling garbage antidepressants, or is that type of thinking the cause of my depression.)   I take 50 mg at bedtime and 50mg just after lunch.   One warning, even at this relatively small dose, quitting Tramadol is incredibly difficult.  You get just about every type of withdrawal imaginable, and it lasts several weeks.  Even if you forget to take a dose by a few hours, you know it.  You get the sweats.",Robin

4,Tramadol,Depression,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 10, 2022",0,"I had, since I was born I may say, a severe depression, anorexia, anxiety. I tried more than 5 antidepressants (tricyclics and SSRI), it worked a little, but I were still depressive and without any motivation, a useless and suffering person. And once I had tramadol for my restless legs. I realized immediately that it didn't work as well as expected for my restless legs, but my depression had totally disappeared ! A miracle! It changed my life. I have never been as normal as now with daily therapeutical dose of tramadol (75gm extended release twice a day).

6,Tramadol,Depression,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 29, 2021",0,I have been given so many kind of antidepressant... But Tramadol is different. It makes me think very clean and reduce my anxiety too. Based on me now my psychiatrist give Tramadol to his patients and they love Tramadol too. What's ugly about Tramadol is that the drug make you both mentally and physically addicted. But it is a great choice rather than antidepressant or sleep pills.,Riaen

I chose the second and my guideline was never cross 150mg Daily and Drug Holiday Method...The Aggressive-Hostile-change personality was nasty but I certainly will stay on this drug.

9,Tramadol,Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 14, 2021",7,"Tramadol is worse medication you can take for your depression or anxiety for a long term; at the beginning, it makes you happy and energetic, but eventually, you are a drug addict and can not function without it, you will be so relaxed that you don't care about anything or anyone; you want to sleep all day long and day by day losing your short memory.  I used it myself for two years and sober from it now for about two years; withdrawal symptom is like you go to hell and back. I am not recommending this drug at all. Take my feedback seriously.

Shock therapy works but the memory loss is horrible.  I've tried Spravato, the new nasal spray containing Esketamine....it made my depression worse.  My psychiatrist put me on Lithium to flatten out my moods and prevent suicide and it did work for those purposes, but I was still miserably depressed.  My PCP suggested Tramadol; he indicated his wife has taken it for years for depression and it works great for her.  I do have low back pain, so that's what he writes on the prescription because MD's in the US can't prescribe Tramadol for depression.  It's indicated for pain.  It works fantastic for depression.  I can function again and laugh etc.  I know this is a lifelong prescription for me but that's ok.  Some people have to take blood pressure pills every day of their lives.  Some take insulin.  For me, it's Tramadol.  My psychiatrist is all for it.  Viva la Tramadol!",SteveO59

Several years ago, I got an RX for Tramadol for a twisted ankle.  Boom!  Wow, it didn't do much for the pain but I felt so much happier, relaxed, ambitious and ''un-gloomy.''  My psychiatrist at the time refused to give me an on-going prescription for Tramadol for depression because of addiction, tolerance, etc.  Being a nurse, I researched Tramadol and found that chemically, it is very similar to Effexor.  I now have an on-going prescription for Tramadol for ''low back pain'' from my primary care doc, who told me his wife takes it for depression too.  My psychiatrist is aware that I take it and has no problem with it, although he says he would be hesitant to prescribe it for me for depression as he could get into trouble doing so.  But he says he's had a few patients over the years who, like me, have gotten significant relief from Tramadol for depression.  I take 150mg daily, first thing in the morning.",VoxRN

I initially started with 50 mg once a day and mainly use it for cognition.  I went through two agreeing psychiatrists to do it. I had taken it for a short term hip bursitis and noticed its cognitive effects and some help with mood and motivation too.  We eventually, well over a year ago, went to twice daily for a 12 HR effect.  It has truly been wonderful.  No signs of tolerance developing yet.

My thinking is not only faster, but positive and inventive. I am engaging in educating myself and I have a feeling of purpose back. I really wish there was more research in support of whatever it is in this medication that effects those with brains like mine. I actually NEED this medication.

I also earned accounting professional certified management accountant and project management professional. I recently stopped taking Zoloft with no noticeable affect. So my life has been dramatically improved by taking tramadol believe it or not I began taking tramadol for severe spine pain. All these benefits by accident.

No more brain fog or feeling down, felt happy and a new person full of energy and confidence. I was on 8 x 50mg for pain a day which is too high for depression but after the pain resided 2-3 50mg tablets a day and your depression and anxiety is gone. A wonder drug for reliving depression and anxiety and you feel better in less than an hour.  I find the best dose to be 2-3 50mg tablets a day as they last about 7 hours.

I have been taking 1 - 50mg tablet daily for at least 5 years.  I was originally prescribed these after a minor surgery.  I can say,  in all honesty,  that I take them even when I'm not hurting (Fibromyalgia) because of the way they make me feel: not high or loopy or drugged.  Simply: hopeful, happy, delighted in life,  no sadness.  I've wondered,  for years,  if there was something in an antidepressant that would do the same thing without having to take pain medication.  I have not found them to be addictive but I am very careful since addiction runs in my family: mother, sister & daughter. I suppose,  as with anything,  if you're not wise one could become addicted.

To enjoy live in the sense that; I can now go out, talk with friends/friends ,think pragmatically and so many other that I have not been able to do before now.

31,Tramadol,Depression,10.0,,"April 18, 2021",5,"Like most, it was prescribed to me for pain (arthritic), for which it does diddly squat.  In particular, I broke a couple of ribs over a year ago while rough camping, and 3 x 50mg had no impact on the pain to speak of; I moaned and screamed just as loudly with, or without.They did make life worth living again, and 4 years or so later, I still take 1 x 50mg every SECOND day.  I seem not to get extra benefit from a DAILY dose, and have no real desire to increase the dosage....  also thru fear of dependancy.I've never been much addicted to anything and that may be a helpful part of my psychology that allows me  to not over indulge. Maybe doctors should look at the personality/history file of a patient, and be less fearful of prescribing it.(Yep the other drugs were nowhere as good, too too long to work; if at all, and left me a zombie thruout the day.)Great forum here, very reassuring",happiernow

With so many other people claiming this I don’t understand why it isn’t prescribed more for depression. It is very weak for helping with pain but works wonders with depression. I took it for years.

Apparently there is a drug problem here and you bring up anything regarding any pain medication and they think you are an addict lol.

I no longer take valium and effexor for my anxiety and depression because tramadol helps everything in my case! It's a wonder pill for me. I usually take 50mg when I get up, 1 later on in the day, then 1 at night. Sometimes I might take 2 in the morning and then 1 later that evening. But regardless tramadol makes me feel normal and able to do my everyday duties without being in a slump. Shame it's a narcotic now bc doctors are hesitant to prescribe and you don't get refills so u have to go every month to your doctor to get it.
