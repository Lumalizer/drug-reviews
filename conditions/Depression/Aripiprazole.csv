0,Aripiprazole,Depression,2.0,,"March 26, 2022",0,"Abilify (aripiprazole):So I started taking Abilify probably about 5 years ago approximately. I thought it was pretty great because I started feeling less depressed. At the same time that I started taking Abilify, I also started seeing a therapist and going to CBT groups. I think all together the meds and therapy helped me a lot. That's why I'm giving it 2 stars. As time went by, I started noticing symptoms that I attributed to other things like aging (hello, I'm 34 years old). I started to not be able to remember simple words like ""remember"" or ""throw"" or ""catch"". Words just escaped me and it became harder and harder to have conversations with people. I also couldn't focus even though I was taking enough Adhd meds, and I gained 80 pounds! I was bigger than I'd ever been but the worst part is the social isolation I feel because it's hard to conversate with people when you can't remember simple words and phrases. I'm still on Abilify but am now going to be tapering off of it after reading all the side effects",Bailey Hill

I chose not to take it due to the risk of getting Tardive Dyskinesia. Despite what you have been told, Atypical Antipsychotics are no safer than first-generation Antipychotics. Antipsychotics were widely prescribed for depression in the 70s and 80s until they realized it was the drugs causing TD as opposed to the illness of schizophrenia.

I was left with a severe resting tremor and excruciating neuropathy that feels like is destroying my life. I am unable to work and barely able to leave my bed.

I am constantly at a moderate state of depression, but frequently, that mood descends to severe for months or years. I really can hardly think of periods in my life where I was actually ""happy"". Maybe a half dozen times of joy in my life. I am on 2mg for just about a month or so. At first, it was a noticeable improvement. But now, after about three weeks the effects seem to have worn off. I am in a worse state than I was before. I don't see my shrink for a couple of more weeks but I hope he will increase the dosage from 2mg, which is clearly no longer having an effect on me. I will tell you, it was, in its brief time, far more effective than any of the hideously addictive SSRI's the medical profession tries to pawn off on people, never mentioning the horrid weeks and months of withdrawal from them.",Jiggus

Now, on the sixth day, I'm still a little nauseous, but not enough to be bothersome and I'm hoping that'll go away too. The positive effects are incredible so far.

Before I went on pills, I told my doctor I was hesitant on starting any sort of pill because I had worked really hard for 1.5 years to get in shape, and was worried about weight gain. My doctor put me on cipralex, it did nothing, so she added Abilify. Within 3 months, I had gained over 28 pounds. Zero diet change, no lifestyle changes, I was just packing on the pounds week by week. After looking in the mirror and seeing what I have physically become, I have never felt more disgusted by my appearance. I immediately stopped taking the abilify and the weight gain pretty much stopped in its tracks. Taking abilify has been the biggest regret of my life, all of the work I did on myself was down the drain within 3 months. I went off them and I have not been able to lose the weight since.

But anxiety and depression started creeping out some more slowly and I just couldn't handle how I was feeling especially being a mother to a 6 year old boy. 2 weeks ago my doctor recommended Abilify at a very low dose to add on with my Cymbalta in which I was iffy about it and gave it some time to think about if I wanted to take it.

Side effects were disturbing though:  compulsive swallowing, eyelids that wouldn’t open fully, severe hand tremors - couldn’t eat in front of coworkers because shaking was so bad. No weight gain or loss.  But, zero effect on mood.  I stayed on it simply because I liked being so productive.  But it didn’t help my depression all, so I abandoned it.

On July 2008 my doctor raised the dosage from 30mg to 40mg, but in April 2010 my depression panic- anxiety attacks got worse. I felt lack of motivation, unproductive, unable to think or make decisions, wanted to be in bed all day. I was very depressed. I went to my Doctor and he told me that since I ahd been taking Paxil for more than 15 years probably the medication was not working for me anymore and he prescribed citalopram 20mg and Provigil 200mg. I'm doing better. Good luck.",Magnifier

Also, it may have contributed to seriously compulsive eating (though Remeron is implicated in that too). The worst aspect was this weird agitation in my brain. It felt like there was a traffic jam of thoughts every so often and this went away when I stopped taking the drug. Everyone's brain is different though. ",Anonymous

By far the worst side effects I have ever experienced were associated with Abilify. The muscles in my legs became so stiff that walking anywhere was slow and painful. I felt nauseous all the time and several times experienced acid reflux. There was the constant feeling of needing to move and involuntary jerks of arms and legs. Sometimes my legs would shake uncontrollably. It took a while for these side effects to subside after coming off the drug.
