0,Hydrea,Solid Tumors,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 6, 2021",0,"I was diagnosed with Thrombocythemia 2 years ago when I had a heart attack with high platelet count of 1200. The Hematologist placed me on Hydrea and I had severe side effect, discussed with Hematologist but was advised the only treatment available.  Stop using after the side effects was too severe, but count only increased and had to be placed on Hydrea again, by the end of 3 month course I couldn't even get out of bed or do anything for myself and the platelet count just fluctuated the whole time and the Hydrea just affected the rest of my cells & health severely, got more weak day after day. I then read on the site of a lady who used Agrylin – discussed with my GP and she contacted the Head of the Heama team, went for 2nd bone marrow biopsy and the medical aid approved Agrylin for use – I’m on this now for 4 months and my health is almost back to normal, no side effects my overall health much better, platelet count dropping on low dosage not fluctuating anymore - strongly suggest you try this",Mea
