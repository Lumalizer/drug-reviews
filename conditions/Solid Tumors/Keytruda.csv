1,Keytruda,Solid Tumors,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 22, 2019",17,"DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!! My mother was healthy before taking this drug. Drug caused her to stop walking, damaged her kidneys and liver and caused fluid in her lungs. Her cancer spread to different areas of her body. Her red blood cells and platelets completely bottomed out in her last month of life and never came back to normal levels. She had severe rashes and pain. This drug shortens your life.  This drug killed my mother!!!!!!",Worstnightmare
2,Keytruda,Solid Tumors,7.0,,"June 19, 2019",15,"My husband stage 4 sarcoma ( Lung Epithelioid Sarcoma squamous cell carcinoma ), a rare aggressive form. Appearing in lymph nodes around the lungs and adrenal gland. Large one between the heart and lung, a large mass located on his adrenal gland. Did chemo for 9 months.  Tumors between heart and lung and adrenal gland shrunk to 1/3 the size it was a year ago, has not touched the others around his lung but the cancer remains stable. Keytruda is NOT without its side affects, he cannot focus to read much, moody for 2 weeks,  after treatments then feels bit better and its time for another treatment. Seems like he has about 50% of the side affects listed, it also caused injury to his thyroid gland and doctor has increased levothyroxine 3 times in 2 months!  Arthritis now in his hip and back. Bruising terribly, weakness fatigue, headaches, insomnia, but he perseveres and forces himself not to give in. He is still here with us.",His wife

4,Keytruda,Solid Tumors,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 13, 2018",15,"My mother has been taking this for a few months and she has completely changed. She suffers from extreme memory loss, confusion, body rashes, and now has to get fluids weekly because she sweats constantly. She has lost an insane amount of weight, lost all her muscle, and is shaky. Her body is in constant pain. She took a break from it for a few months and during that time she felt better but her cancer came back. They say she will be taking this drug for the remainder of her life. ""it'll keep her alive"", but honestly, at what cost?  This medicine has robbed her of her quality of life.I would never recommend this to anyone who is looking for healing. it does more harm than good.",johndoe
