1,Divalproex sodium,Cyclothymic Disorder,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 12, 2021",2,"I am taking a low dose of 500 mg twice. I'm tapering off lithium (300mg for a few more days), so I am not sure how it is stand alone. Lithium did nothing for me, but this drug makes me calmer, sleep better and my anger issues are subsided. I am sad I cannot take a sip of alcohol as an internet search scared the bejesus out of me. DO not drink with this drug!",andrasnm
2,Divalproex sodium,Cyclothymic Disorder,8,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 13, 2017",7,"I took depakote two different times, once in 2016 and in 2017. The 5 months I took it in 2016 I noticed I had less ocd and insomnia. My hair got thinner but not so badly and also I felt like I couldn't do activities that requested an intellectual effort.The seconde time I took it for a period of about two months I didn't feel like it slowed me down like the first time, but my hair lost was worse and it made me very hungry. I discontinued it because the hair lost was too much. However it still helped with my ocd and calmness.",Depakotee
