0,Lithium,Cyclothymic Disorder,6,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 16, 2021",0,I took Lithium carbonate 150mg at night for mood disorder and suicidal ideations related to PTSD and anxiety disorder. It immediately stopped my nagging suicidal thoughts and calmed my racing thoughts down at night time but even at a low dose it came with side effects. First off my sleep became very unsteady and I would awaken several times at night which is linked to its decreased REM sleep activity. It also completely got rid of my libido and gave me bad ED which reversed exactly 6 days after stopping it. I can see why its such a blessing for those with bipolar and I do believe its safer than some reports claim but it is just not worth the hassle to me. I will try and work on my bad thoughts via ongoing therapy.,Jackson
1,Lithium,Cyclothymic Disorder,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 26, 2021",5,"Been on lithium since December 2020 and never felt better. I’m calm, patient, no racing or obsessive thoughts. I stopped crying and feeling down. My PMS is way better and I don’t get all irritated and edgy now. In a nutshell, Lithium is worth trying. Hope it’s good effect is gonna last.PS: One side effect I dislike is the metallic taste in my mouth but not sure if that’s due to Lithium or the probiotics I’m taking. I also get super thirsty so I drink a lot and end up in the bathroom most of the time. But it’s still worth it. Oh yeah, and I’m super hungry all day. But I manage to stay healthy as much as I can.",nnnn
2,Lithium,Cyclothymic Disorder,10,,"November 21, 2020",7,"Hi everyone I’ve been on lithium for around 2 years in total I did come off my for a couple of months but had bad withdrawal so decided to go back on it! Overall lithium is a good drug it’s helped me no end it’s helped with my mania but not my depressive episodes has anybody else experienced this? It’s great for my mania though just not depressive episode! I also take risperidone 5mg for psychosis, venafaine 150 mg propananol 160mg and buspirone 20mg",Calatk97
3,Lithium,Cyclothymic Disorder,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 19, 2019",23,"I came across one of these reviews here and decide to try lithium Orotate OTC supplement. I had previously tried: lamictal (gave me the rash), topamax (gave me memory loss and lip sores), Abilify (made me have psychotic visions), I was getting desperate.... My Cyclothymia gives me lack of focus, difficulty thinking, irritability, extreme mood drops where I feel exhausted and sometimes just downright angry. Lithium Orotate took all of that away. I take 10mg in the morning and it keeps me stable, happy, focused, energized... sometimes I need a little more around 4pm, I put a pill in water and take a few sips. So in total I amProbably taking 11mg per day. I sleep like a baby, no nightmares, peaceful sleep. It’d been a life saver and I will be using it to control my mood swings.",The darling
4,Lithium,Cyclothymic Disorder,8,,"August 13, 2019",7,It keeps me balanced but does not help with insomnia when hypomanic.,Tim
5,Lithium,Cyclothymic Disorder,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 4, 2019",14,"I am on lithium and it did not stop my manic induced insomnia. So my doctor tried Seroquel and now Abilify known to take along with Lithium for mania. My body handles lithium well, especially since my blood-level is only 4L after taking 900 mg daily. I suspect my pdoc will want to increase to 1200 mg but then I will not take Abilify (scary side effects as on most psychotics), all in all I am well balanced (thank to Lithium) except for the insomnia which I hate but nothing is perfect. I have noticed that if I take any amount of alcohol and sweets my hypo-manic phase is not too far behind.",Tim
6,Lithium,Cyclothymic Disorder,10,,"July 1, 2016",13,"I've been on lithium for 4 months now.  As far as helping my mental symptoms I couldn't be happier BUT after about 2 months my hair started coming out.  My doctor assured me it was not the lithium (even though it's a documented side effect).  He said it was due to the huge amount of stress I had been under and hair shedding was the effect of it now 3 months later.  Well, after 4 months my hair is STILL coming out and I have 1/3 of the hair I had before.  I cringe everytime I wash it because I don't want to see all those strands circling the drain.  My doctor insists I continue it and he hasn't even offered to change it (only reduce the dose 1 month ago).  Folks I have had enough!!  I decided to try lithium orotate OTC.  I started it today.",I need my hair
7,Lithium,Cyclothymic Disorder,10,,"March 7, 2016",60,"Ok, we all know that people respond differently to meds BUT this is my story.  I was on the verge of losing my husband of 24 years.  Feeling I had hit rock bottom I decided to see 1 more doctor.  I had taken every antidepressant under the sun in the last 20 years for ""anxiety and depression"" and I had high hopes every single time.....nothing was working and I was getting worse.  My doctor started me on lithium 300mg twice daily.  I can honestly say I felt a huge difference after the first 24 hours.  My mind was QUIET and I felt calm.  No racing thoughts, no panic attacks, no overthinking anything.....just peace.  I have been on it for 2.5 wks now and I FINALLY feel normal again.  I am more considerate and loving to my family <3",44yroldmom
