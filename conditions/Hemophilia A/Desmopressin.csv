0,Desmopressin,Hemophilia A,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 21, 2021",0,"I use DDAVP injections for my mild haemophilia A to prevent bleeding prior to surgery and treat spontaneous or injury induced bleeds, it always works well. I always flush in the face and ears with it but otherwise no issues. It was given to me prior to my cesarean section for my son but the doctor upped my fluid IV causing dangerously low sodium levels but it was quickly adjusted and no harm done in the long term.",DCW
