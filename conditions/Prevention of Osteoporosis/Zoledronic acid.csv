0,Zoledronic acid,Prevention of Osteoporosis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2022",0,"Reclast (zoledronic acid):I am writing a positive review for Reclast, I have osteopenia, and had breast cancer in 2021 which  I now take Letrozole which wears on my bones. I have no other health issues. I had my first infusion on Monday Feb 28th, drank plenty of fluids on Sunday and Monday added Tylenol. After the infusion I was a little tired and got some rest. Returned to work on Tuesday, my eyes began to feel a little different but the nurse instructed me to take Claritin if the Ibuprofen did not help. I did have tingling in my fingers for a few minutes, but it went away,  I was also exhausted and got some more rest. Day 3, Wednesday, moving a little slow in the morning, took my normal mid day walk and by afternoon I was back to normal.  No other side effects thus far. I pray my bone density increases when I have the bone scan again in 2024.",Anonymous
1,Zoledronic acid,Prevention of Osteoporosis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2022",0,"Reclast (zoledronic acid):I got my Reclast infusion almost two weeks ago. Eight hours afterwards I started feeling pain in my joints, ribs, hips, and especially my chest. I also felt this weird heartburn I'd never felt before. The pain escalated to severe: it spread to my eye sockets, down my arms to my fingers, I got a splitting headache, and started throwing up. I spent 15 excruciating hours in the ER, where a doctor eventually said that after researching Reclast, she saw that one third of every patient who receives it experiences some variation of my symptoms. I seemed to recover, but I spent last night vomiting again. I am encouraged by reports here by people who've received benefits and will cross my fingers. But why are patients not alerted to the possibility of severe side effects???",MellyMad
2,Zoledronic acid,Prevention of Osteoporosis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 20, 2021",1,"I had my first infusion on 9/10/21 and was scared based on the reviews I read beforehand. I even got a second opinion from another rheumatologist as to whether or not there were other options for me and also spoke to my primary care physician before I decided to do it because she knew I had such bad heartburn from the weekly and monthly pills that I had to stop them. Since I wouldn’t commit to prolia 2x a year for the rest of my life I decided to try this knowing I could stop it at anytime if necessary. Bottom line was the infusion was simple and I didn’t have any side effects at all. I kind of held my breath for 3 days waiting for the axe to fall and nothing happened. I drank 50-60 oz of water for several days before, day of and 5 days after. I even took a Tylenol after the infusion and one before bed but probably didn’t need them either. Now I will continue taking my calcium and vitamin D and hope for the best in my next bone scan. I can’t rate benefits yet.",Dee
3,Zoledronic acid,Prevention of Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 22, 2021",6,"Reclast (zoledronic acid):My mother is very healthy at 83. She takes only one medication for reflux, has full mental capacity and above-average strength. She had one infusion resulting in severe bone/joint pain, high fever, complete incoherence, a cough, dizziness, and ocular palsy. C-19 was ruled out, as were other diagnoses. After eight months, some of these symptoms continue. Since this Rx is supposed to be given in a series of three, the full effectiveness will not be realized since she obviously will not be getting the remaining two infusions. Do not, under any circumstances, inject this  stuff into your body. Find some alternative therapies and supplements instead.",Anonymous

5,Zoledronic acid,Prevention of Osteoporosis,2.0,,"June 18, 2020",7,"I used this drug zoledronic 3 months ago recommended by endocrinologist for mild hypercalcemia due to vitamin D overdose! The first day was ok but then have got 3 days of fever, malaise, tightness in the chest and neck pain followed with tachycardia for which I got medication. Thought I’ve passed the side effects!

The next night I awoke with a terrible headache & was unable to ignore it.  I took a pain reliever & slept for 4 hrs only to awaken again in severe head pain.  The next day I still felt truly horrible.  I went to the ER because it was a Saturday where I had an X-ray of my neck & the ER dr gave me 4 trigger point injections of lidocaine in the base of my skull.  Still fighting pain! Additional trigger point injections. When does it end? A month so far of pain.  Don’t do it!!",Annie

Seemed fine after the infusion but the next day woke up with every joint hurting. Couldn't hardly stay awake all day. Severe chills and then a 100.5 fever. Took Tylenol and alternated with Ibuprofen. Nauseated and no desire to eat. Had to force myself to drink. Day 3 started with rosy cheeks and still have them on day 4. Looks like a butterfly Lupus rash. Headache for about 24 hours. Neck is still a little sore but luckily the hips don't hurt as bad. Also had stomach pain and seem very bloated. I don't think I will do this again.

I recently had my repeat bone scan and my osteopenia has improved significantly in the two years since. My PA didn't see any urgent need for me to have the infusion again although where I am on prednisone 10 mg every day, its recommended and since I did not have any post infusion side effects, I'm eager to have it again.

11,Zoledronic acid,Prevention of Osteoporosis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 12, 2019",32,"Reclast (zoledronic acid):HORRIBLE!! The injection itself was a piece of cake and first night zero problems. Night #2 started off with some muscle aches. NBD (no big deal), the doctor warned of flu like symptoms. The aches got worse as the evening progressed. I got up as I was feeling very restless, when I touched the floor I realized I was FREEZING COLD! The coldest I have ever felt in my life. At the same moment starting with my feet I had severe muscle cramping up the entire length of my body. I was scared to death! I thought I was having a stroke or something as I lost complete control of my body. I lay back down and willed myself not to pass out. I’m not sure whether I did or not! Several hours later I was able to get up and take some Motrin to help with the muscle pain. Semi normal by morning, but completely freaked out! Now several weeks later I am having massive hair loss! This drug SUCKS!",Joni

13,Zoledronic acid,Prevention of Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 20, 2018",10,"I had my first infusion of Zoledronic  acid on 15/6/18. Everything was fine until about 7pm when the pain hit me and I couldn’t move. I was told I would have flu like symptoms  but it was far worse than that. I couldn’t sleep or get comfortable in bed because of the pain. The next day was even worse and by the 17th my husband rang the 24 hour helpline I was told that the pain was normal and to ring 111 for stronger painkillers from the out of hours doctor. The doctor phoned and told me I may have high calcium levels and I needed to go to A and E for urgent blood tests. I did this and all the tests came back normal I was given stronger painkillers and told if the pain got worse to see my GP. It is day 6 now and the pain has eased but not gone. I have no energy, very tired and feel this has put my recovery from Breast cancer back months. I am now uncertain as to whether I will be having another infusion.",Solly

That night I had a hundred and two fever and chills and everything ache from my bones to my muscles. By Friday morning I was having seizures on the floor of my kitchen, I woke up in time to watch my body flopping around like a fish!

16,Zoledronic acid,Prevention of Osteoporosis,,,"January 4, 2018",12,"Next day after injection I could not lift simple light items, lean forward, bend over all due to pain in my chest.  Every breath hurt.  Saturday woke up in tears to the same breath pain and still couldn't lift anything. Sunday felt confused, major headache on left side started (same side as injection). By Sunday night my breathing only hurt on a deep breath, but left eye socket pain started along with headache. Monday still severe eye socket pain and headache, woke up to eye swollen shut. Doctor said to go to ER and they admitted me for 2 days, eye swollen shut, bright red in a large area around eye.  They wrote it off as Cellulitis, but I had no pain due to the redness and white blood cells never elevated showing I was fighting infection",Nan Kivi
17,Zoledronic acid,Prevention of Osteoporosis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2017",16,"Reclast (zoledronic acid):Less than 36 hrs after my first Reclast infusion I began shivering violently for over 2 hrs. Then I spiked a temp of 102.7. Within 24 hrs that had gone. Day 4 post infusion my left arm, wrist and hand began to hurt. This was the arm I received the infusion in. Now it has been 8 days since the infusion and each day the pain gets worse in my arm and hand. When I awaken the entire area is swollen and so painful even a sheet touching my fingertips brings excruciating pain. 2 extra strength Tylenol last about one hour. 4 Ibuprofen last about the same. Aleve (Naproxen) will last about 6 hrs. 2 Tylenol #3 gives relief for about 2 hrs. The pain and swelling have traveled up my arm, into my upper arm above the elbow.",halfadime7
