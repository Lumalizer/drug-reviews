0,Evista,Prevention of Osteoporosis,5,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 6, 2021",4,"I was prescribed Evista, after taking Hormones caused a cyst on one ovary, which was surgically removed.  After taking Evista for 17 years, I was diagnosed with Endometrial Cancer, and had a complete hysterectomy.  I think the Evista caused the Endometrial Cancer.  However, my bone scans have been good - no osteoporosis.",endometrial
1,Evista,Prevention of Osteoporosis,1,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 2, 2016",57,"After taking Evista 60 mg. for 5 years for treatment of osteopenia, my recent bonedensity test, the -04.2 which is osteoporosis.  Even though my insurance would not cover it, esp. now that I am on Blue Cross Blue Shield/Anthem prescription plan,. Evista is on the 5th tier so they do not cover it.    I took it in good faith, believing it would strengthen my bones, now osteoporosis.  I am 69 years old and was shocked after my Dr. told me.  Now, they want me to see an rheumotologist to discuss taking Prolia.  (I know nothing about this medication.)  How can I trust this will be a good prescription when Evista made the bone loss worse.",Suzanna46
