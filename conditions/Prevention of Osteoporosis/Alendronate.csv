I started wondering if it was this medication, read the side effects and sure enough, that’s the problem. I won’t be taking another one, and hopefully this pain will go away.

1,Alendronate,Prevention of Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 28, 2022",0,Two seniors in the same house taking Alendronate Sodium tablets 70  mg once a week. Feeling stiff and sore at night the next morning had a hard time getting up because of the pain. The next few weeks one went from pain so bad has to use a walker to get around. Had x-rays and MRI to make sure of no broken bones. I can not help to think we got a bad dose seeing it was a renewed prescription. The one thing they don't put in the patients guide is how to stop the pain.,Ella

9,Alendronate,Prevention of Osteoporosis,1.0,,"May 25, 2020",23,"9 months from just 2 doses (35 mg/week) and I am finally recovered from the severe arm, hand, and shoulder pain it triggered.  A factor in my adverse reaction to alendronate is likely that I was also taking PPI's, which I learned later amplify absorption.  After the first dose, I noticed sharp pains in my fingers that came and went.  After the second dose, the next day I had severe pain in my right forearm, which grew worse over the next few days. I switched to using my left arm, but then that forearm grew painful, too.  (I also had a few cramps in my thigh muscles over the first few days, and some pain in the balls of my feet).  Over the next few weeks my forearms slowly improved, but as I started using my arms more, I developed pain in my shoulders and fingers.  With rest, everything slowly improved.  Believing I was well at 5 months, I carried a heavy bag on my shoulder, which triggered 6 weeks of shoulder pain.  Now, at 9 months, I'm finally okay.",nutmeg

My bone density 2 years ago showed some improvement,  although my doctor felt it should have been better. I had another bone density a month ago and my osteoporosis  is worse, so basically I took this medication for nothing. He wants me on Prolia but those side effects really scare me.

Took my second pill the next week. Felt like throwing up, the coughing still constant and developed the worst headache. Went to the doctor the next day, diagnosing me with acid reflux and to stop take Fosamax ‘for now’. If I ever feel better, I’m not interested in going through this again.",Angela3950

Through the night it got worse,  but figured it would settle down.  OMG !!  That next day , I felt like a can that was being crushed.  I felt like I was going to be paralyzed from my right arm, through my hip , in my groin  area, and my right shin and leg was numb and still is. My right side still  hurts  after 5 months or more. Spent a whole day in the emergency room where the same doctor was on duty.   The doctor  tried to say it seemed like it was my back nerve. Barely gave me anything for the pain. I stay in pain.

I've been on it 1.5 yrs and fortunately did not have the side affects most others noted.  Went to see an orthopedic surgeon for another issue and I mentioned this drug and my Dx.  He said STOP TAKING IT!!!  He said my bone density is normal for someone my age (67 male).  He said his wifes T-Score is worse than mine but she doesn't need to be on it, and in fact should NOT be on it, and that I just need to get calcium through food, and vitamin D.Turns out that the drug companies had a drug without a Dx, so they basically created a Dx and cheap scanners for the Dr. office to sell this drug.
