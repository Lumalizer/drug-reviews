0,Risedronate,Prevention of Osteoporosis,1.0,,"August 6, 2021",5,"Actonel (risedronate):My pain started approximately 6 weeks into taking the actonel 1 a week. I had read side effects and was careful of taking this drug the proper way, after approximately 4 weeks started having pain in my upper left leg muscle or bone (so bad I couldn't walk on that leg). Two weeks later always taking the drug my pain was unbearable, my doctor scheduled me for MRI, ultrasound etc..and nothing was found as per the results...but my pain was still there.  My doctor probably thought it was all in my head but she continued to try anything such as pain medicine (which didn't help) I decided finally that the only drug that I was taking different than my prednisone was Actonel so I decided to stop it.  I will see what will happen, within 1 week my pain was reducing, within 1 month of not taking Actonel my pain was completely gone. I love sports so I am active ..back to golf, pickleball, walk daily 3-5 miles..my age 72!! I get a monthly blood test so far so good!",Taffy

2,Risedronate,Prevention of Osteoporosis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 7, 2020",11,"As of today I am one week past my first monthly dose of risedronate for the prevention of osteoporosis.  I’m 58 years old, active, healthy female.  I took my first dose on Monday 6/1/2020 in the early AM before work, with lots of water.  By Monday evening I began to feel ill, my temperature rose to 101.9, I had chills and sweats intermittently all night. Took Tylenol for the fever and it responded   I was so weak and achy I could barely dress myself for work.  I felt horrible and flu-ish all day.  By the afternoon I developed hip and groin pain so severe I could barely sit, kept taking Tylenol with limited results.  This pain has continued all week.  This morning I was awakened by such severe knee pain that I couldn’t bear to sleep.  As I’ve tried to walk I find my legs are weak and extremely painful.  The muscles above my knees are swollen and weak. I plan to call my gynecologist tomorrow, but will never take this drug again.",Tamars

9,Risedronate,Prevention of Osteoporosis,1.0,,"February 2, 2017",21,"Took first pill morning of Oct 4, 2016 & that night went to turn over in bed & felt the most excruciating pain in my lower back radiating through my chest that it took my breath away.  In tears, went to my regular dr who prescribed muscle relaxers & home from work for 2 days.  I also experienced flu-like symptoms, a recurrence of my acid reflux, tiredness, increased insomnia & just felt lousy.  Reluctantly took the 2nd dose in Nov, didn't experience the back pain (but still have episodes of that back spasm but very slight) but did experience all the other side effects. I'm so done with this med and now my gyno wants me to take Prolia.  Reading forums and it's side effects, I am scared to death especially since it's a six-month dosage!",Madre Carol
