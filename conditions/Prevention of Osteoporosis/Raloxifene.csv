1,Raloxifene,Prevention of Osteoporosis,7,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 23, 2017",17,"I had been taking Evista for osteopenia for about 10 years and then switched to the generic form, Raloxifene.  I have been using Raloxifene for 2 years and have experienced no adverse side effects.  However, my doctor feels that the risk of stroke and blood clots associated with this drug are significant enough that she wants to switch me to a different medication, such as Boniva.  Several of the reviews written about Boniva and its generic form show that the most common side effects are flu-like symptoms and severe muscle pain.  I'm hesitant to try a new medication that has such discouraging side effects.",ounceofprevention
2,Raloxifene,Prevention of Osteoporosis,1,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 2, 2016",57,"Evista (raloxifene):After taking Evista 60 mg. for 5 years for treatment of osteopenia, my recent bonedensity test, the -04.2 which is osteoporosis.  Even though my insurance would not cover it, esp. now that I am on Blue Cross Blue Shield/Anthem prescription plan,. Evista is on the 5th tier so they do not cover it.    I took it in good faith, believing it would strengthen my bones, now osteoporosis.  I am 69 years old and was shocked after my Dr. told me.  Now, they want me to see an rheumotologist to discuss taking Prolia.  (I know nothing about this medication.)  How can I trust this will be a good prescription when Evista made the bone loss worse.",Suzanna46
