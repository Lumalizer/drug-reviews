0,Acetylcysteine,Acetaminophen Overdose,9,,"May 19, 2010",22,"Mucomyst-10 (acetylcysteine):It was really early in the morning, and I went to take Tylenol, when I misread the directions. I meant to measure out two tablespoons of the drug, but accidentally used my measuring cup instead. I ended up chugging two cups of Tylenol instead! I was rushed to the hospital and given Mucomyst-10 to offset the effects. Mucomyst-10 saved my life. Thank you Mucomyst-10!",Anonymous
