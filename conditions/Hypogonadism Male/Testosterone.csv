In February after admitting to my doctor my emotions felt too feminine he had my T levels checked. Everything was fine. Then in May I was involved in an accident. A week later my levels were tested again and found my free-T was at 32. Doctor put me on Androgel 1.62, two pumps. After 8 weeks my level went up to 60. Still couldn’t maintain an erection. Had a lot of chest sensitivity but no growth. Energy level changed only slightly. Fast forward to after 7 months, and after increasing to three pumps a month ago, I feel like I’m on a rollercoaster. Most days I’m feeling like I’m back to where I started, few days I feel energized. I’m suppose to be getting a blood test next week. So far, I’m not impressed with the Androgel. I’ve read all the literature, but I still have no idea what to expect. I’m going to go take a nap.",Jim

They all are greatHelped me lose all my BMI to a regular BMI increased muscle mass, lost lots of over weight and helped a lot with sexThe only problem is you cannot use them like a regular pill.Example first I used the shots.  However it is pretty nearly impossible to safely use the shots on myself, I needed someone else to do them for me. Then I had a physician injection  a two month supply subcutaneously and I do not remember what part of my body, then I had a cream that I smeared on me as needed which was by far the best but did not last very long because after a while my skin would not allow the testosterone cream to be absorbed by my body.  Finally I ended up with a absorb able pill that i used sublingual..",Mark L

I’m a 31 year old male!   I am prescribed a very strong opioid medication and it can cause hypogonadism.  I have no choice but to continue taking the opioid, so I asked my doctor for hormones.  He prescribed Androgel.  So far I have noticed more energy, higher libido, and my erections are more frequent and longer lasting.  I haven’t noticed any changes with muscle mass, but I have lost the spare tire and love handles I had developed.  The extra weight looked strange on me since I am a rather small framed man.  I have lost about 18 pounds of body fat in just two months.  I plan to go back to the gym to work out and see if I can build more lean body mass.  Overall, I am quite satisfied with Androgel.",Michael
4,Testosterone,Hypogonadism Male,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 13, 2021",3,"AndroGel (testosterone):I have BPH and a T level of 27 as well as a fluctuating PSA at 72 years of age. Dr put me on Androgel pump 1.62 2 pumps a day and my libido went through the roof. Seemed like I was on overdrive after only a couple of days. Of course could not get dr on phone so after 6 weeks I just stopped the gel. 2 weeks later the hot flashes returned and I calmed down again, sorta got used to the level of calm. I heard that my bones could suffer without the T so maybe I will try one pump a day. I use rubber gloves to apply cause  I don't want the excess absorption through my hands and the white powder it leaves is a billboard that I am using something. Fortunately cost is not a concern, did not realize how expensive it is, as the VA sends it to me. Does anyone think I should try the one pump a day just as a test? The androgel people will not comment on such things for liability reasons. As a close.. It does exactly as advertised but for me it was, is, too much.",fredziffel

6,Testosterone,Hypogonadism Male,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 25, 2021",1,"Androderm (testosterone):The fix for patches falling off is using an alcohol prep pad prior to placing patch. Make sure the alcohol evaporates and then stick the patch on. It will never fall off after that.I am 43 and had 190 level and after 4 months of 4mg patch and getting vitamin D pills I am at 1070 which my Dr is uncomfortable with. I am now on 2mg patch. This has changed my life. I had terrible depression, anxiety, panic and no motivation. This all almost instantly lifted. I wasn't having issues with erections but do notice morning erections like I had when I was a teen. My body has lost its weird weight and I started finally building muscle. I have not been able to build muscle until now. My only complaint would be quality assurance. These patches are never the same. Too much glue causing aluminium disc to stay on patch when it should come off with cover. Some patches empty after 24hrs some don't seem to empty at all. Not sure what is up with that",Mnmeds

My comment is more towards taking the injections. I had been taking the injections for years, Yes I felt great and was able to pack on muscle quickly while I was working out. My levels would spike at 1400 and bottom out around 750. But pumping that much testosterone into your system comings with a price. My doctor believes that my usage of the injections and drinking habits has caused myself to develop a fatty liver. I believe we have caught it in time to reverse the damage but only time will tell. My point to all this is to  be cautious while taking testosterone replacement therapy! Yes you will feel like a young man again and have you strength, energy and etc back. But at what price is it worth it? Respectfully yours Papaw",Papaw

11,Testosterone,Hypogonadism Male,6.0,,"February 27, 2021",9,"AndroGel (testosterone):I used androgel for 3 years.  My PSA fluctuated quite a bit and my doctor recommended I see a urologist regularly to make sure I didn’t  develop prostate cancer.In general Androgel worked well for me.  I had more energy and more sexual desire. Also, had more intense erections and ejaculations. Unfortunately, my S.O. couldn’t keep up with me and I started seeking other outlets for my sexual energy  (lots of masturbation and porn).  I eventually started seeing prostitutes.Finally, my urologist saw my PSA spike and thought she could detect prostate issues (maybe cancer).  Prostate biopsy was negative, fortunately, but she recommended that I stop Androgel.My libido is much lower now and I have slowed down on the extracurricular sexual activity (no more prostitutes).

Following research I discovered that prolonged opioid usage does indeed reduce testosterone levels.Now, after a couple of months of testosterone replacement I feel transformed.

The weekly visits to the Dr was also becoming an issue. I went to a new urologist after moving, and he suggested Testopel. I didn’t think my insurance covered it, but they do.

That went well for a full year at which point my Dr. put me on gel, 4 months ago.  I emailed her and told her it simply wasn't working and she had me tested again and my level was 88!  I'm now going to 4 pumps a day and I really hope this works for me as it's been REALLY disappointing so far.  I would be ecstatic to have a level of 2-300.

However, after month and a half of using the patches it started to produce skin reactions, which has become stronger and stronger. In the beginning, the first month, it was just producing a very mild irritation which would be gone within 1-2 days. However, later it started to produce a rash and very irritated red ""bumps"", sort of an allergic dermatitis, in the skin despite the fact I rotate the application places of the patches. Some of the red bumps take about two weeks to go and they left a mild dark spot in the skin (I hope the skin comes back to its normal color).Another downside of the patches is the quality of the adhesive. In my first month, about 12 of the patches came with a really bad adhesive, which could fall within 5-6 hours or less.

You generally do not lose weight on testopel unless you are overweight to start with.  My whole body is different with muscle mass. but my weight follows my T cycle. I lose 6-10 pounds in my last two months before my next testopel insertion, but then gain it all back 1-3 months in.

Did they even test this product?  It goes on like rubber cement and stays sticky.  I literally have to peel my shirt off every few minutes.  The real winner though is that it smells like a third-world bathroom spray.  I sell wine and absolutely cannot make a living wearing this awful-smelling stuff.  What in the world were they thinking?
