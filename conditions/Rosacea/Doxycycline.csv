2,Doxycycline,Rosacea,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 19, 2021",1,"Starting in January of 2021, I began to get what I thought was acne on both sides of my upper cheeks below the eyes, and on the nose.  The right cheek was particularly bad with pimples under and beside of my eyes.  Thinking it was acne, I took everything OTC I could for the last year.  Those OTC creams only made it worse, which made me suspect it wasn’t acne but something else.  Finally, a week ago, I realized it had gotten so bad and was bleeding and swelling worse than ever before.  I decided to go to a dermatologist.  He diagnosed me with Rosacea and he prescribed 100 mg of this twice a day.  Not kidding that after one single pill, taken that night for the first time, the problem had cleared up completely by morning.  I continue to take it because I don’t want a repeat breakout, but I was amazed by the results coming that quickly and felt the need to share.  Only downside is that taking it without food burns my stomach.  With food, though, it’s harmless.",Mike

Upon first spots, boils appearing, and as I love gardening, thought I'd had insect bites. Was put on various antibiotics, lymocycline, oxytetracycline, and on bad breakouts (huge pus filled, red boils) amoxiclav, huge tablets, with little effect! After seeing another doctor, who took photos and referred me onto consultant, was diagnosed with type 2 rosacea, and put on Effracea (doxycycline) 40mg modified release. Can honestly say, have never looked back! Within a week face started clearing, had a healthy glow, and when a spot tried to appear, never really erupted like before, and was brilliantly controlled. Recently another doctor declined my prescription, and got me to try Soolantra cream. I stopped tablets, applied cream, within one week face breaking out, by week two, huge spot, face felt dry, itchy.

23,Doxycycline,Rosacea,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 27, 2019",10,I had mild rosacea on nose and cheeks. Mainly the former which was bright red and inflamed with broken veins starting to show over a few month period. I rarely had pustules though.  I tried out doxy 100 and initially for 5 or so days things got worse but then things calmed down. Nose still got red but not as much and the damage subsided i.e. you no longer saw broken red viens (the old damage remained). This was just over a 30 day period. So not a perfect but it seemed to have an anti inflammatory and antibiotic affect. I didn't want to be on antibiotics for too long so stopped (i just treated it as a trial to assess whether antibiotics/anti inflammations would work). Sadly once off within a few days everything started coming back and now a week or so later I'm right back to previous state. I'm now trying out Metronidale.,Bob84

This Christmas I had the worst flare I’ve ever had. My cheeks were covered in papules. My face was bright red and BURNED and stung horribly.  It spread from cheek to cheek within weeks and nothing would calm it down. Derm prescribed Doxy 100mg 2xday and within 2 weeks the burning subsided and bumps started to go away. I’m so thankful it worked. My skin is not perfect but the painful part is gone. I plan on continuing on with the pills for another 3 months.

I had been battling constant pustules and papules for over a decade, getting much worse the last four years. I had tried a range of over the counter creams and treatments, and on rozex cream for a year - which helped a bit. A new doctor put me on this and in six months I have virtually no pimples or skin thickening at all. Miraculous. I did find I needed to combine it with a pill to settle my stomach, the main symptom burping and a little discomfort. My skin is now clear and I can happily go makeup free. Results began after two weeks but it took about five months for the full impact to be seen.  Highly commended for p/p rosacea. I am in Australia and the price is very reasonable",Susie Jane

I also feel lethargic, loss of appetite and had blurry vision only for 2 days.  I hear the permethrin cream can make it worse before it gets better, and the doxy takes a while to work...so it needs to be taken for a couple of months to see how it goes.

107,Doxycycline,Rosacea,10.0,,"May 6, 2010",39,Oracea (doxycycline):I started using Oracea along with Metrogel 2 weeks ago and I've already noticed a significant difference.  The little bumps that were all over my cheeks and forehead are almost all gone.  My skin is so clear now and I've received numerous compliments on it.  I plan to continue using it and hopefully with continued results.  I would recommend this to anyone suffering from the embarassing effects of rosacea.,KristiK221
108,Doxycycline,Rosacea,9.0,,"April 30, 2010",19,"I was working with a close friend installing a line to an ice-maker in my home when he asked what the rash on my face was. After a little bit of a cussing match I knew it was not acne. I had done pre-med before switching to teaching and diagnosed myself with rosacea. I dealt with for about 5 years when of all people, my opthamologist asked if my face was always dry and red...whoa. Well, I said yes and I hated it. He said ""Want fix it?"" What more could I say. 2 to 3 days in on Doxycyline and I was clear skinned again. The only minus is that it does upset my stomach, but I just found out about eating first and sitting up for 30 minutes. I had been taking it before bed time well after dinner. Now I take it right after dinner with water. Voila'",Thankful teacher

My dermatologist confirmed it was Rosacea and prescribed doxycycline hyclate.  In about three days of the one-pill-a-day 100 mg dose, my rosacea completely cleared up.  You shouldn't take it on an empty stomach.  But it is fine after a meal or dinner.",Anonymous
110,Doxycycline,Rosacea,6.0,,"October 6, 2009",30,"Doxycycline worked very well- and very quickly for me. I noticed results within a week and after using it for a few weeks- my skin was completely cleared up! Good deal, right? Not quite! I continued to take this medication for over a year. Suddenly I began to have a HACKING COUGH immediately followed by vomiting. (Coughing so hard I would vomit.) I couldn't figure it out. I began to get very sick. Couldn't eat and then couldn't even function on a daily basis. I became so sick, in fact, that I was hospitalized. I was taken off the medication and voila!- the ""draining"" in my throat subsided, the cough stopped, the vomiting stopped. So BE CAUTIOUS!",Cautionary Tale
111,Doxycycline,Rosacea,6.0,,"July 26, 2009",28,"Here's the issue, my rosacea abated for the most part while using doxycycline monohydrate 100mg twice daily. The major issue is that I started retaining fluid for no apparent reason (went to doctor, Kidney and endocrinology specialists) and after stopping this drug, the swelling went down remarkably (> 15 lb loss in 4 days). This is a significant problem with other antibiotics also, Levaquin, Ciprofloxacin, etc. Even if a limited number of users have this it is significant. I hope that reading this helps someone else, I suffered for almost 2 years.",tonym123

It cleared all my redness in 3 days. I was told not to expect it to work like this for (at most) 6 months but it cleared up amazingly. It might not work so incredibly for you, but if you have mild to moderate rosacea I expect that it will.",sieanaa
113,Doxycycline,Rosacea,10.0,,"February 15, 2009",42,Oracea (doxycycline):I was diagnosed with Rosacea a year ago and was in terrible shape.  My rheumatologist (for lupus and fibromyalgia) recommended I see a dermatologist because he believed I had Rosacea.  I thought I was just having a recurrence of terrible acne.  My dermatologist diagnosed the Rosacea and put me on Oracea.  Incredible.  I cleared it completely in just a matter of weeks and have had no recurrence.  I am amazed and delighted.,Jawjah
114,Doxycycline,Rosacea,10.0,,"February 9, 2009",44,"Oracea (doxycycline):I was diagnosed with Rosacea years before taking this drug. The usual topical prescription did not give much relief so I quit using them. When I developed little hard bumps I went to a new doctor and was given Oracea samples to try. I was AMAZED! I thought for years that my face was always ""puffy"" due to lack of sleep or diet but after taking this for just 2 weeks I looked and felt so much better. Puffy skin GONE, redness DRASTICALLY decreased. I am SO EXCITED about this drug. I have just 2 negatives: #1 - my side effect was a burning sensation around my mouth and on my lips. No redness, just the sensation - this subsided in my 4th week of use. #2 - cost of this drug is too much. After my samples ran out I was unable to afford it and now suffer again.",K-L

Neither of us had any particular opinion of its efficacy until we had to interrupt his therapy for budgetary reasons.  While he was off Oracea, his condition flared and visibly worsened.  When we resumed his therapy we could see the improvements almost instantly!  Thank you, thank you!",Shorty's wife
