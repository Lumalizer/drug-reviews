0,Clobetasol,Seborrheic Dermatitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 9, 2019",3,I tried this topical medication on my scalp for 5 days.  No reaction first two days then extreme itching day 3 followed by horrible/on fire burning sensation.  Upside - did not have to wash hair every day.  Was switched to fluocinolide and have had no issues.  Downside - have to wash hair daily due to oil based med.,Rosie's mom

I have tried nearly every shampoo and formula for seborrheic dermatitis/psoriasis, and nothing clears it up like this! And itâ€™s almost instant! I am so, so thankful my dermatologist recommended it. No more embarrassing flakes and stubborn itch.",Blonde

3,Clobetasol,Seborrheic Dermatitis,,,"September 14, 2009",44,"I have been a user of clobetasol for my dandruff for almost a year now and I was able to see results almost instantly. I have ethnic hair and I average washing my hair once every 1-1.5 weeks. After each wash, I part my hair once down the middle (forehead to neck) and once across the middle (from ear to ear) and apply a light application of the cream to each of the parts and on my temples. This lasts me until my next wash. Life has been much easier for me since!",Spel
