0,2 in 1 Dandruff Topical,Seborrheic Dermatitis,2,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 24, 2021",0,"I tried using a shampoo containing pyrithione zinc for multiple years to try and treat my Seborrheic Dermatitis. Over that time it did very little to reduce the excessive skin flaking that was taking place all over my scalp and face. I stopped using pyrithione zinc and decided to give ketoconazole shampoo a try instead and what a difference it has been! Within a few weeks, my skin has stopped flaking almost entirely. Would definitely recommend using ketoconazole instead of pyrithione zinc.",T
1,2 in 1 Dandruff Topical,Seborrheic Dermatitis,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 25, 2014",11,"DermaZinc Shampoo (pyrithione zinc):I lived with this condition years before I found DermaZinc shampoo. I tried everything. NOTHING ever helped, except a large shot of some kind of cortisone at a dermatologists office.  That helped for a few weeks.  4 to 6 at most.  DermaZinc worked well for me the first time. Like a miracle. I use it once to twice a week and have no breakthrough. My only complaint is it is very drying and you have to use a conditioner. My scalp is sensitive to most and will break out due to dyes or scent. When I first found it there was also a conditioner, which is no longer available, ALa Scalp I think.  It was wonderful. Now I use as natural a conditioner as I can find like Burt's Bee's and try not to get much on scalp and rinse well. A bottle lasts 6months.",Angeliinaa
