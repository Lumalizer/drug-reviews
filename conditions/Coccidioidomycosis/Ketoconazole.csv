0,Ketoconazole,Coccidioidomycosis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 14, 2020",0,"I have been using ketoconazole shampoo for 3 mos., scalp lesions are now dried up... I had been active since Nov. 2019 and through Oct. 2020. It works really well, except that its very drying; used coconut oil with essential oils for that (cocci. doesn't react), and they simply moved south, from inside the scalp to other parts of the body. Now, I am dealing with them in ears, sinus, neck lesion, one battle at a time, but my scalp which is very visible (due to much hair loss), is a positive. I recommend it.",Carole
