1,Leuprolide,Endometriosis,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 12, 2021",0,"Lupron Depot (leuprolide):Just got my second 1-month-Depot shot yesterday. I can’t say I like it but it’s also not terrible. I have had hot flashes at nights or sometimes during the day, I wake up more often at night, usually because of hot flashes or sweating. I am not used to feeling warm, I rather feel cold quickly. Kinda nice to feel warm actually. Def not horrible. Didn’t gain any weight so far, had definite some sugar and carb cravings but switched to a sugar free low carb diet and feel much better on it. Also working out daily helps. I’ve had one real break down moment a couple of weeks ago but I am also in a difficult life changing situation so I wouldn’t completely blame it on the drug. However that was ONE day and then I was feeling okay again. I’ve had joint pain in my elbows and and a few headaches (I never have headaches) and I feel vaginal dryness. Def felt increased libido the first two weeks. All in all not too bad. No idea if it’s working yet but  I’m hopeful and would do it again.",June

To much medicine I had take  and it is a risk to my kidney function and no medication help me at all. I just keep asking how come I only had this Lupron after 8 long years in suffering the terrible pain. It makes me feel better and be able to do the things that I never ever been doing for 8 years because 2-3 weeks in pain every period.

After trying all the hormones, we discovered I also had fibroids and adenomyosis. My doctor performed a hysterectomy with RSO. Even with that, I kept having cyclical bleeding and endo pain. We agreed on starting lupron depot for 6 months with progesterone add-back. I was incredibly nervous because of all the reviews. The first 2-3 weeks were pretty rough. Migraines, emotions all over the place. By week 4, I felt amazing! As the first 3 month shot started to wear off, symptoms began returning and I couldn't wait for the next round. Dose #2 is coming to an end and I can confidently say I haven't ever felt better. This drug was a dream come true for me!

I can deal with the hot flashes but I've currently been bleeding and cramping for 4 weeks and they just keep telling me to wait it out.  I'm due for the 2nd shot in July and idk if its going to help at all. I am depressed and the night sweats are a lot to deal with.

I had however severe headaches that made me dizzy, experienced some mood changes (mostly anger), painless sex, hot flashes (manageable) and joint pains at the end of my last shot. The joint pains are mostly in my knees and fingers but i only experience those after waking from a nap. Once I get up and start moving about they disappear. I now await my cycle to return.

I was disappointed to find mainly negative reviews but I took a leap of faith and decided to get the injection anyway. Within the first month I truly regret that decision. In tough situations I typically look for the silver lining. However I was not prepared for the extreme fatigue (No more 5am workouts), hot flashes all day every day, night sweats that literally leave my side of the bed soaked (it’s totally gross), but the topper is body aching and hurting down to my muscles and bones like I have the flu...every day going on 63 days straight.

14,Leuprolide,Endometriosis,8.0,,"February 4, 2020",9,"Lupron Depot (leuprolide):My doctor told me about Lupron Depot, told me the side effects and I was weary because it's an antineoplastic.

My period stopped before the second shot. I will say not to get it in the arm (deltoid) because my first shot was in my right arm and it hurt even a month after. I get my fourth shot on the 18th and I can tell you, the benefits will outweigh the negative side effects I'm having.

I couldn't control my emotions, I was either dead inside or crying, there was no in between. My night sweats were awful and I was mean all the time. The worst part was probably my memory. I had no recollection of anyone's name, I could recognize their face and the fact that I definitely know them, but never their names if I had met them after I was on Lupron. The shot also hurts like anything and hot flashes are real. I was consistently warm all of the time. Summer was unbearable. Also, the first few months were the worst endo pain I had ever felt. It was terrible. It finally went away after about month 4 or  5 and I was in a normal range of just feeling pressure down there. It wasn't nearly as painful, but always present.",KB

I've been bleeding nonstop for over a year now. Received my first 1 month dose of lupron on 11/22/19.

The last week of the month, I got my period but the bleeding and pain were much reduced from before.  Noticed an improvement in pain during intercourse.  I am on the add-back and have had no night sweats, hot flashes, or vaginal dryness.  No impact on my mood that I could notice.  Received my second dose, the 3 month long dose, yesterday (12/20/19).

I’m tired lots but I can function with some caffeinated tea & b12 for energy. Mood swings and little depression/anxiety. It’s not intense depression for me like nothing that makes me want to harm myself it’s just more of a dark cloud following you around. So if you have mental instability before taking the drugs make sure you talk to your doctor. I did not lose hair and my hair did NOT thin/fall out. I did not gain weight.

They also offered two other options to stop the pain hysterectomy/ ablation.. either way would be fine since endometriosis will and has eaten up my reproductive organs. After the laparoscopic surgery it did take me 5 months to heal internally, so if you do this option please prepare yourself for a much much much heavier and DIFFERENT period for a least the first two months.

That said, if I can be rid of most of the pain after the 6 months regimen, it will have been worth it! ",DanniKJ1
