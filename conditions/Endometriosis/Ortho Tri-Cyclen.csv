0,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Endometriosis,2,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 17, 2018",0,"2 stars for predictable periods. Periods were still painful and longer than normal. Nauseous every time I took it, even with food. Constant abdominal discomfort while on it. I felt depressed and unmotivated. I was on it for a year and decided to stop taking it after it was recommended that I take it continuously (skip sugar pill week) because I got a period the 2nd week that was heavy and very painful. As soon as I stopped the pain diminished greatly and my mood improved. Wonâ€™t be going back to this.",Notworthit
