0,Zoladex,Endometriosis,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 29, 2022",0,"This is my second month for this injection, the first month was so bad. I had too much side effects, night after my injection I had hot flashes and painful bones especially on my ankles. And day after day it gets worse had dizziness everyday, constant tired without reason and super fatigued, muscles pain, super vaginal dryness and couldn’t walk longer bcoz my feet and legs hurts so bad. But there’s also good side effects like I’m totally no more bleeding/period or even spotting so it means no pain.",Swissa
1,Zoladex,Endometriosis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 8, 2022",1,"Awful! Had three and experienced constant neck, shoulder, calf and bone pain everyday. I’m still experiencing these pains one month after stopping Zoladex. I was also given HRT add back and it didn’t help at all. Feeling anxious, tired, constant headaches and the pain all over is terrible. Hoping once my periods return I will also return to feeling normal",Tyiokhv
2,Zoladex,Endometriosis,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 25, 2022",0,"Diagnosed at 29, Zoladex for 6 months. Endo pain only subsided since you do not get periods while taking this drug. However, I experienced terrible inflammation and water weight gain, my clothes stopped fitting after the second injection. I workout and eat healthy mind you. I am constantly fatigued, and lack motivation. Brain fog is real on this drug. The hot flashes are so miserable, couple it with the insomnia and it has been a miserable 5 months. The cellulite and weight gain has been the hardest for me, since I am into fitness. I feel like I’m in someone else’s body. I get headaches daily and usually suffer a migraine within 24 hours of a dosed injection. I’m on my last dose and I’m hoping after I can get back to my normal self. I dealt with sciatic pain with the endo, it’s not as bad but still around. I’m still trying to figure out if this treatment has been worth it. We shall see by April.",CBL
3,Zoladex,Endometriosis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 15, 2022",0,"Have had the 3rd Zoladex implant and the side effects are ramping up. Was born with Uterine didelphys so had had issues for years - heavy bleeding, pain, endometriosis and horrific PMDD (Like PMS but so much worse) Unsuccessful Endometrial Ablation so started Zoladex to see how I cope with no hormones. Wow. Mental health greatly improved. Side effects only start after 5 weeks and now they’re pretty intense- hot flashes, insomnia, weight gain, fatigue, vaginal dryness and, grossly enough - leaking of urine! The last side effect has made me quite alarmed but it can happen my Gynae says. Hopefully have a hysterectomy soon where they’ll take the ovaries too. The benefits to my mental health FAR outweigh the annoyance of the side effects.",Marilyn Sparrow
4,Zoladex,Endometriosis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 20, 2021",0,"I have had Stage 4 Endometriosis for 20 years, in the past I had Zoladex (no HRT) which stopped my periods and pain, but I went up 3 dress sizes in 6 months.  It did seem to help for a while but I ultimately ended up with more surgery (5 in total).  Now, 12 years since my last op (and 2 miracle children later), my endometriosis has stuck my ovary to my urethra and bowel, and eating into my bowel wall.  I have adenomyosis and a huge fibroid etc. which all just adds up to debilitating periods, 3 transfusions, morphine patches and an inability to work.  I'm now back on Zoladex and due my 3rd injection this week, but this time the experience is completely different!  I ended up with severe joint pain (poss also complicated by my Raynauds) so started HRT and I now have bled all but 3/28 days with minor flooding (compared to normal) and I feel no difference in size of my uterus.  I don't think Zolodex is going to help me this time, could be this combo of fibroids and endometriosis, not sure.",Anonymous

After having a 3 week heavy bleed on the first month, my other symptoms are pretty mild. I've had a few headaches (but this is normal for me), a few hot flushes which are barely noticeable, but I have had painful urination due to thinning of the vagina / pelvic tissues. I believe my fibroid has shrunk as can not feel the bump anymore. My breasts are not painful anymore as they would be on my normal cycle. So surprised by my lack of symptoms. Having an ultrasound after my third injection to see how much my fibroid has shrunk.",Kat

7,Zoladex,Endometriosis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 13, 2021",0,"At first, reading all of the scary reviews and side effects I was SO scared to try Zoladex for my endometriosis symptoms. I was truly desperate, miserable and out of options at the time. Zoladex saved me (temporarily until I could get my excision surgery )! To start I had terrible cramping and bleeding, after the first two injections ( monthly injections ) I was almost symptoms free from my large cysts and Endo pain . It's not right for everyone, but it CAN work for some ! Hot flashes and mood swings aside, I'll take that over the pain I was in daily.",Lyssa
8,Zoladex,Endometriosis,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 30, 2021",3,"You know, these reviews had me horrified when I first started this medication 6 months ago. I was a mess of anxiety because I thought this stuff was gonna be horrible. So let me tell you, don’t worry! People are more likely to write about their negative experiences rather than their positive ones. I’ve literally had zero side effects from these injections. My periods stopped after the first one. I spotted up until the 4th one. I have severe stage 4 endo so I do still have symptoms from that. But the actual injections are nothing. They numb my stomach before injecting. I feel a slight pinch and that’s it. I have no hot flashes, nothing. I just wish it 100% took my endo pain away. Hopefully my surgery will help for a little while, at least.",starheartt

I have been suffering for years and have really been on so many trials, zoladex was my last resort. I have only been on it once and there is still severe clotting, heavy bleeding, painful cramps that never go away and it’s constantly me crying in a ball. If anything I’m not going back on this again, I know I’ve only had it once but it’s not helping me at all. I’ve had no morphine to help, no laparoscopy that would help. I have been trembling and crying since last week, been feeling nauseas, angered, tearful, depressed, change of appetite and as someone who has such a short temper it makes my temper worse.",Channtelle99

Most important, after taking the first injection of it my bleeding continued for 15 days and i was feeling just restless during this time as it was so heavy and unmanageable. My instructor advised me not to take ""Pause"" to stop it as its main activity is to wash all blood and extra tissues which were not possible to remove during surgery. Now I will take my 3rd injection but since then I had no periods. Hot flashes are quite normal and manageable.",daspiyali

Was put on Synarel nasal spray after surgery in an attempt to reduce leftover bowel endometriosis. Switched to Zoladex after two months on synarel as was worried I wasn't taking it correctly. Loved being on Zoladex, despite the hot flushes, mood swings, bit of weight gain I had no bleeding until Mirena insertion around my 3rd injection. During mirena insertion, gyno noted vaginal nodule meaning the zoladex unfortunately did not work to reduce the bowel endometriosis.",bg
12,Zoladex,Endometriosis,10.0,,"April 21, 2021",2,"I was on Zoladex for six and a half years due to Endometriosis causing severe pain and frequent hospital visits requiring morphine. Initially,  for six months but I did so well on it, completely pain free that I decided to continue until menopause as opposed to a complicated hysterectomy. I tried coming off at age 49 but had to go back on due to pain coming back, I tried again at 51 and was great for 18 months but sadly intolerable pain returned although no bleeding. MRI showed large mass believed to be  adenomyosis with ovaries stuck to uterus and uterus stuck to bowel very low down at the rectum! They are still reluctant to do surgery so I'm now back on zoladex aged 53. Three months in still having pain and problems. On the whole, Zoladex was great for me, I got my life back after 30 years of pain, I had some hot flushes and sleep disturbance but a small inconvenience and far more preferable than the constant pain. Although I'm having problems again, I still recommend Zoladex.",JD
13,Zoladex,Endometriosis,10.0,,"April 4, 2021",3,"I suffer from endo and adenomyosis and when I have a flare up the pain is so severe it makes me vomit. Unbearable, hospitalised several times and have had several surgeries. Zoladex is A LIFESAVER!!! I was on it for 9 mths last year then after being off it for a few months for IVF I had a bad flare up of my adeno, had the zoladex shot and overnight the swelling and inflammation in my abdomen disappeared and my waist shrunk by 15 cm. Side effects are annoying - I have had a few angry sweaty outbursts that I know were 100% just side effects. Also there is a well known zoladex flare where your bleeding and pain symptoms will act up again around 7 days after injection.  But after that it is much less. I didn't like the Mirena but I love Zoladex. Would be great to get the benefits without the side effects but it is not a perfect world. For me, it is totally worth it to deal with the pain and try to preserve my fertility.",Busymanda

The other was meant to be for 4 months but I only managed three. I found the side effects too much to cope with: hot flushes, joint pain, depression, anger, tearfulness, hair loss, insomnia, appetite changes... I already have a lot of joint and body pain due to other health problems which may be one reason why I found it hard to cope. For me the worst thing is the low mood which isn’t helped by the insomnia. I hope I never have to take this drug again. For me it was a terrible  experience.",Pooters

I felt I needed to share my experience as I have suffered terribly with endo for over 15 years and had debilitating pain daily for the last 4 of those. Zoladex is the first and only thing that has ever worked in relieving me of my crippling endo symptoms. Whilst on Zoladex I have no flair ups, no pain, no periods (so no heavy blood loss), no fatigue and no head fog. It's been so amazing for me, that I want to shout it from the roof tops!I must advise though that after the first month on zoladex I started getting very intense hot flushes and some insomnia - but I was then prescribed Livial to take along side the zoladex and now I feel amazing! the hot flushes ceased as soon as i started taking Livial and I just wish I could take this combination forever, and am dreading the day I have to come off Zoladex, as I'd forgotten how wonderful it is to feel healthy.",Jess
19,Zoladex,Endometriosis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 20, 2020",11,"After being diagnosed with stage 4 endo and fibroids, my OBGYN started 6 months of zoladex. I was told it would be a good month before I felt any difference- but I had the hot flushes come on after about 7 days. The overall effects were amazing. No heavy bleeding and clotting, and no pain which would normally totally disable me. The side effects I experienced were intense. Hot flushes every 40 minutes, I just wanted to strip off. Interrupted sleep, teeth pain, joint pain... After 3 months I called my obgyn who is a fantastic man and he sent me a script for a tiny dose of oestrogen to lessen the symptoms. What a difference that made- nearly no symptoms. I’ve been off the injections for about 4 weeks now and have just got my first period- thought it would be at least 8-12 weeks before it came back. Zoladex is great - just make sure you definitely follow up with side effects, and don’t just ‘suffer’ them - it is so worth having the injections!!",Jacinabox

I have been in and out of hospital since 13, having countless operations to try and find the cause of my pain! Hospitalised every month during my period due to extreme pain until my doctor put me on Zoladex! I never wanted it to end, the no pain and period free life was much more appealing than continuous hospital appointments and anxiety over when my monthly was coming! The implant was initially painful however worth it to ease the pain. Bar routine check ups and going for the injection I haven’t been hospitalised since starting the treatment! Probably the best decision I made and also suffered few side effects which was even better!",Anonymous

My gyn decided to put me on zoladex for 6 months after my key hole surgery in order to shrink the womb, fibroids and manage my Endo condition to make my upcoming surgery easy for them as all reproductive organs were glued together due to Endometriosis. But surgery was cancelled as my condition improved. No periods for 13 months, never felt so good in 18 years, celebrated menopause and bang, period showed up but so manageable as I had slight cramps on first day and no pains till now on my 3rd. Normal bleeding unlike the previous flooding I use to have. Hoping to go for more shots after my period as I pray my gyn will continue zoladex on me. Yes I experienced menopausal symptoms but was happy with them all as I preferred the hot flushes and co to  loosing so much blood from endometriosis pains and blood loss.

My hair is still falling out which was beautiful and thick, now dry and thin, my skin is always dry, my hands sometimes crack, so I have had to take high doses of calcium as it is now thinning my bones.  I also take Zinc & Iron to help with my hair and the constant tiredness.  I take anti-depressants, but have terrible mood swings.  However, I will keep taking the Zoladex as this by far weighs constant hospital visits and staying in due to extreme bleeding, and then having to have to have a blood transfusions on 2 occasions.

26,Zoladex,Endometriosis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 7, 2019",8,"I love Zoladex, my GYN first tried this with me back in late September 2015. He started with the 30 day dose then moved me to the 90 day dose. I was thrilled with this medicine, the only issues were my libido was down (not good for a woman that just married 2014) , and I experienced extreme brain fog. I visited my GYN, told him that I did not want the Zoladex anymore because of the brain fog I experienced. He said that he wished I'd told him that, because he would have prescribed me estrogen. He said that the reason we experience the brain fog is because the medicine cuts off all the hormone estrogen to the brain. That all was needed was get 1% estrogen to the brain and brain fog should be eliminated. Well it worked like a charm, but I was scared to try it again. Nothing worked they made me bleed longer, which was not a good thing because I was anemic. My GYN and I discussed getting back on the Zoladex with Prempo (estrogen) from the start. I agreed and he put the Zoladex in.",SIs Val

I had a recent diagnosis Stage 4 endometriosis and adenomyosis, so the Zoladex implants were prescribed by a leading surgeon after he performed successful excision surgery and removed the left ovary. The Zoladex is used in conjunction with a Mirena. Within the first month of treatment I was having hot flushes and consistent low grade headaches so then was also prescribed Livial to deal with those side effects. I was being treated for anxiety and depression before the Zoladex, but my psychiatrist doubled the dose of Citelapram to 40mg about three months in to deal with the sudden mood drops.

Both ureters were compressed but within a couple of weeks of the first injection, I could pass urine freely again, all the bleeding stopped and my tummy felt normal again!!

I had some spotting 2 weeks in but my endo pain has mostly subsided and the hot flushes/headaches/insomnia have been totally manageable. I do feel quite forgetful and slightly achey but so far no depression. If anything my moods have improved (probably due to less pain!). I have been taking a methylated multivitamin and low dose naltrexone at night plus 30 mins exercise a day, maybe these have all helped. I wouldn't want to be on it longer than 4 months but it definitely hasn't been as bad for me as I was anticipating. A lot of ladies do really seem to suffer on it but maybe the people with positive experiences don't tend to write reviews? So I thought I would.

The only side effect I had was a heavy period at first (nothing scary) and then I had hot flashes and some night sweats but nothing unbearable. Get a small pijama (shorts and tank top) to avoid feeling so hot at night. Emotionally I was ok and lost weight !!! I actually gained 4 pounds after the treatment when my ovaries reactivated. During this treatment I exercised a lot, ate well and tried to stay relaxed.Please do not be scared of using this medication...",AMJR

47,Zoladex,Endometriosis,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 13, 2016",11,"Have been on zoladex once a month injections for a year now. Awful side effects for the first 8 months . Terrible joint pain, hot flushes, bowel habit changes, bad mood swings, complete lack of sex drive, depression that drive me to contemplate my place on earth, lethargy . Also massive weight gain ....Over 2 stones. The plus is I now am free from periods and the horrific pain I endured. Prior to zoladex I had an ablation where they burnt off my womb lining. This was unsuccessful . Make your choice as the side effects are really awful but the pain I suffered was so life limiting . I would be screaming out in pain unable to move a muscle.

I have been put on Zoladex 3 times in the last 10 years and I have to say that it it has been absolutely fantastic every time. Stopped my periods and my pain which was unbearable at times to the point where I ended up in the hospital having morphine injections numerous times. Yes I did get hot sweats and a little weight gain but I will take that any day over the kind of pain that Endometriosis brings. The only down side is that you do have to come off it periodically as you cant stay on it for long periods of time due to its effects on bone density.",junib40

I am 31 years old and have already have 4 laparoscopies- fortunately I do not want children. For those who are scared, the injection does not hurt. You can opt to have an anesthetic anyway. Although I no longer suffer from the horrific pains, constipation and vomiting associated with my periods, I do still experience bleeding after my injection along with cramping which as far as I know is not normal considering the aim of Zoladex is to effectively induce a medical menopause. This was meant to cease after 2-3 injections. But I guess everyone is different, this is what gynecologists are for- speak to them!",Anonymous

I'm not in any pain at all, which is exactly what I wanted. However I am struggling with the side effects; hot flashes, headaches, weakness, night sweats, tiredness, bone pain. I was struggling to get through the day before the treatment, and now I have these other problems to deal with. I am torn about how I feel about it. I would definitely recommend it though, as everyone has different levels of these symptoms, I might just be a bad case.",Alex.c

My doctor has put me on Zoladex for 9 months and I am on month 4. It has helped to manage my pain so far, initially it had taken virtually all of the pain away but within the last month it has slowly been resurfacing but it is still better than when I don't take it at all. The hot flashes, flushing, slight weight gain, night sweats, trouble sleeping, muscle aches, moodiness, anxiety, vaginal dryness and lack of sex drive are all bothersome but it beats being in constant pain and I know that the symptoms are temporary. I would definitely recommend Zoladex for endometriosis pain.",Ashley0407

57,Zoladex,Endometriosis,7.0,,"November 27, 2011",18,"I have used Zoladex 3 month implant for 9 months, as I suffer from Pulmonary Endometriosis. Zoladex was the only medication that successfully stopped my periods, and to stop my lungs collapsing every cycle. Positives would be no mood swings, clear skin, and no periods therefore no pain. Negatives would be I gained 10 kilos, which I'm working on losing, but the weight was better than having horrific lung pain. I did have a small amount of bone pain, but this has stopped since I've been off the medication for a month. The other negative is its only subsidized in some parts of Australia. One state its $25 the other $1000 for three months. I hope this helps. In many ways Zoladex has helped me live a normal life again.",Anonymous

It was better then just going with out the medicine - it is a shot given by your doctor or nurse once a month below your belly button, it hurt but only for a second and it did leave little dot scars from where the needle went. I had treatment for 6 months and didn't have any signs of endometriosis  but the down fall is that you do gain weight from the medicine. When I started I gained almost 20 pounds and I tried to maintain it during treatment. Doctor said it's easier to wait until after treatment is over, then work on your weight.
