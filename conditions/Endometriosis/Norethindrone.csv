0,Norethindrone,Endometriosis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 12, 2022",0,"I struggled for 17 years with my Endometriosis. Went to a new gynecologist and he recommended I try Norethindrone. He said the first month might be awful but to keep going. I’m so glad I did. The first month I bled for about 2 weeks straight, my face broke out terribly and I was so annoyed with everyone and everything. After about a month, my period completely stopped. No pain, no bleeding or spotting. I’ve been on this medication for over a year and I can’t believe it took me this long to find it. I call it my miracle drug. Anyone who has endometriosis knows that you get pain throughout the month not just on your period. My pain is 100% gone. It’s amazing to have my life back. I no longer have to schedule my life around my periods because I no longer have them and it’s incredible!",AN11

It's unbearable for me but I'm hoping to last until March after my endo surgery to get off it.",Kote

3,Norethindrone,Endometriosis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 2, 2021",0,"Sharobel (norethindrone):38 years old, started taking after Dr said I most likely had endometriosis (always painful periods, then one day pain continued even while not on period).  I also noticed I had signs of low progesterone and told him that as well (anxiety, horrible moods, losing hair, periods beginning almost immediately after ovulation).  It took a while for my body to adjust, but within the 1st week, my pain was almost completely gone!  I had spotting periodically for the 1st month or so, but physically I felt so much better I didn’t mind.  My husband even commented how much my mood has improved since taking this pill.  I’m starting my 4th pack and my periods are so light, cramps barely there (I used to be in so much pain for a full week, it was exhausting just getting out of bed).  I went 2 years in constant pain and anxiety, I really wish I was prescribed this sooner.  My Dr first prescribed a combo pill and it was awful for my mood, so I was hesitant trying, but I’m so thankful I did!!",gymnasticsmom

I have tried Lupron  Depot, Orilissa and had laparoscopies to try to help but this medication has messed me up the worst out of any of the previous ones. Half of my body went numb and so did my hands one night along with a headache- symptoms of a stroke. I have also had my period twice in a month with huge clots and have to change a night time pad every hour. Also, my cramps are worse, feels like I am miscarrying. Not to mention hair loss, depression and aggressiveness.",A. Rios
5,Norethindrone,Endometriosis,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 14, 2021",0,"This was the second medicine I was put on to try and help my endo. At first it worked well although I had to go to max dose within a month because the others just were not cutting it. But after several months of using it it just wasn't enough. I've had to take max dose of this medication on top of every other med I've tried. It helps a lot while paired with other meds but nothing is enough to stop my pain unfortunately. Definitely worth a try in my book, especially if your case isn't as severe as mine. It'll probably help a lot!",Jexxa

I ended up with excruciating cluster headaches which are more painful than  migraines. Felt like I had sharp pain in the eye for hours. I was also having fogginess with my vision  like it was harder to ready close up. It was bizarre . I really didn't like it.,Jenna C

In 2016 I began having pelvic pain, turned out to be ruptured cyst. In 2019 & 2020 I underwent testing for endometriosis. In 2021 had a triple surgeon op for endo & was put on Norlyda to keep hormones in balance (at age 34). I noticed tiredness with 1st packet. About to finish my 3rd pack & my skin itches horribly everyday; vision gets blurry; sweating more; depressed (& coping differently); and gained 13lbs!! These are listed side effects for Norlyda, unbeknownst to me. What's not listed is that my nipples are incredibly ugly now, my butt crack hair grows quickly, & more acne breakouts. BUT, I am living pain-free and with little effect to my pooping schedule. My periods are sporadic, usually shorter with darker blood. My whole body changed using this bc. :(  Sorry if TMI, but I think its important to share and I hope I helped someone with my experience.",Ms. Urda
8,Norethindrone,Endometriosis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 23, 2021",1,"I started taking this because my usual 7 day long, heavy, painful period suddenly made it to day 10. It didn't seem like it was ever going to stop. After 2 days of taking 5mg of norethindrone twice a day, my period finally stopped on day 12. I was so relieved but then the nausea started kicking in. It lasts from the morning until bedtime. Eating is a struggle and yet I managed to put weight on somehow. I was put on a lower dose but the nausea still persists. I'm glad that this medicine made me quit bleeding but the nausea feels like when I was pregnant and had severe morning sickness.",Missy

I was prescribed this medicine for fibroids, heavy menstrual bleeding, and possible Endometriosis. There is 1 plus side... I was supposed to get my period on June 8th and have seen no signs of it yet (today is June  14th) I've been on this med since May 25th. After only 2.5 weeks, I stopped taking it 2 days ago. My body does not like it one bit! I have nausea, shakes, diarrhea, insomnia, lack of appetite, blurred vision... the list goes on. Even though I haven't taken it in 2 days, I still can't sleep. It's 5:49 am as I'm writing this and I've been up all night with diarrhea. I can't wait for this med to leave my system. I really wish I had a positive experience because it did help with my menstrual cycle like the Dr. intended. I don't know what I'm going to try next.

My doctor prescribed it to help with my severe periods due to endometriosis and I was bleeding insanely bad and having the severe cramps. Ever since I started this I have yet to have a period. I take it at the same time everyday, the most I’ve gone is 12 mins past my pill time. The only side effects I've had was some acne for the first couple weeks but now my skin has stayed clear, my boobs are slightly smaller, I am slightly more bloated (but I do have IBS and endo) and I had some trouble sleeping for like the first 2 weeks but nothing crazy, just had a hard time falling asleep. I have depression and anxiety and this medication has not affected it. I think the key to this pill is taking it at the same time everyday. So far I would rate it 10/10",mandymae171

My doctor thought this would be a better tolerated treatment than Lupron, but I have to wonder how bad Lupron is, because this med is not my favorite.  It's not awful, but it definitely has had its side effects for me.  Bloating, weight gain, constipation, extreme fatigue, decreased sex drive and trouble achieving orgasm, worsening anxiety and depression. I'm supposed to be on this for 4 more weeks, and if I wasn't doing this because I wanted to have a baby, I would go off it tomorrow.  It's doable, given the desired outcome, but I really look forward to getting off of it and feeling like myself again.",Noranora

I started this medicine on the 18th then had to go to the ER for such bad cramping two days later. I was constantly nauseous, getting sick every time I ate, I lost so much weight after a week that my ribs were showing and people were commenting on my face looking sickly. My ADHD meds were no longer effective during the time I was taking this, it even got to the point where water would make me sick. While at the ER they gave me tramadol for the pain (I hate pain meds! But every time I could feel them wearing off I would get the same intense pain and passing out as the night I went to the ER). My periods before were intense and I would pass out every month but nothing as bad as this! I should have questioned my dr more before going on and that’s what I recommend anyone doing before starting this! I’m only 20, my period should not be this bad!! Or this hard to fix!!",Anonymous

My dr prescribed this after I had to get off of Daysee(which I liked before I problems 2 months in). The first day I took it I got so nauseous and sick. I was taking it in the morning and would be nauseous all day, so I switched to taking it at night before bed, and I would wake up so sick and unable to eat until evening. Anything I ate made me sick and I lost about 6lbs in just the first 3 days of starting. Well the nausea never went away and I ended up quitting this after 4 days because I threw up so bad which I never do. Honestly this medication did nothing except make me sick 24/7 and I couldn’t take it anymore.",F

I noticed a few weeks in that I was getting horrible moods swings and lashing out at everyone around me. I would cry very easily for no reason. I chalked this up to starting a new career until other side effects started- my breasts started hurting me and were swollen, I got 2-3 yeast infections in 2 months and completely lost my sex drive. The newest thing is my legs have been cramping me and I have a cyst on my face which was discovered after a facial. (I've never had a facial cyst in my life.) I started this due to SEVERE cramping each month with my period but have decided to stop taking it. If there are any alternatives that you can take for pain- definitely try that first!",Chinkyb78

But the pain I endured before was awful and while the side effects are first were tough to get through I am much happier now than I was living in pain. It takes at least 6 months to feel normal again. It's a tough go but it's a decent pill to prevent the pain and periods.

I mainly started for horrible, heavy periods and intense cramps. The combo pill (both times) was absolutely horrible and I’ve never felt worse in my life. Heather has been good for me, but has cons. I have irregular periods now, but they’re not very heavy and I barely get cramps anymore so the periods aren’t bad at all. The periods are also short (4-5) compared to my usual 8-10. Using Heather now has made me capable of doing my usual day to day activities while on my period. The downside is the hormonal acne. My skin is oily and acne prone but I’ve been getting painful cysts from this birth control. The irregular periods and acne are worth it for me personally because my endo made my periods a living nightmare before. When I first started it, I was on my period for a month, but after that they’ve been pretty short aside from the one time that I missed a pill.",rach

I know you are supposed to give it time but honestly, I didn't think it was worth ""waiting it out"" or giving it a chance, given that it made me feel like rubbish instantly. It made me feel like an apathetic zombie most of the time and when I did have emotion, it was either pure rage or distraught. My libido completely disappeared along with my natural lubrication and sensations. Didn't help with endo pains at all. Turned my stomach into a bottomless pit about an hour after taking it - I ate EVERYTHING in sight. Gave me nagging headaches. Only thing positive I can say is that I'm not pregnant.",Venus

If you are not sexually active and don't have a cyst- don't take this- it has done nothing to help with my endo or chronic pain- I am still experience sciatic pain, painful ovulations- nothing has changed. In fact I got more help from my anti-inflammatory diet, advil and yoga to regulate my cycles and minimize the cramp pain. I definitely do not want to have my period every 3 weeks- seeing doctor on Monday. I also do not want to go on Vissane which causes worse side effects then Micronor does either.

My cramps weren’t as bad as when not using birth control. 8 months later and it’s still the  same. I’m actually getting off Errin because my active lifestyle isn’t really fitting with having my period half the month. With Errin my acne skyrocketed too. My chin and cheeks have never been so broken out in my life. I used to never wear makeup and now I can’t bring myself to be in public without it.

I am very happy to say that by giving it time that the depression has subsided, I don't cry without reason, I am still moody but can feel it coming before I react to a situation unreasonably.  I started meditating and stretching before bed which helps me be in a better state for sleeping.  As for my diagnosis, its working - I no longer have bleeding rectally during menstruation and the constipation is gone.  I am no longer in constant pain - but manageable pain.

Horrible acne, weight gain and unwanted hair on my face. Also my mood has changed since I've been on it. I stopped taking Nora B today and I know once it gets out of my system I'll be way better. In the near future probably 2-3 months I do wanna get back on a better birth control that will help it better. I do not recommend this birth control to any women with Endo.

However, I have not had a period or spotting since I began, which is what my OB intended. I actually increase my dose from 5 to 10 to alleviate negative symptoms caused by my endometriosis medication, and it’s while the hunger has worsened, everything seems to be going quite well.

I was actually given this pill before I was diagnosed with endo. I proceeded to have heavy, EXTREMELY painful periods that would last for weeks. The mini pill gave me the most severe pain I have ever experienced in my life, not just with my menstrual cycle. It was that bad. Other issues: I had pain when I was ovulating, I'm pretty sure it was giving me cysts, hair loss (though that did start to alleviate around month 6), acid reflux, nausea, severe acne (and I already had really bad skin to begin with). Besides that it gave me pretty bad anxiety all around. I stuck with this pill for 9 months before calling it quits. My cycle never became regular, and I couldn't take the severe pain anymore.

For about 2-3 months I was ok, but I noticed some changes in my mood and some bloating. Then about 3 months in (February 2014) I had spotting. I thought maybe it would be normal after having NO period for 2 years, but then 2 weeks later I had a full-on period. Since then I've had maybe 3-4 periods in 2 months, extremely painful tenderness in my breasts. ",nerak86

The second surgery showed no sign of endometriosis yet I continued getting severely ill with my cycle and missing work for several days each month.  Doctor always gave me oral contraceptives that included estrogen which caused constant illness and extreme bloating . Finally, I was prescribed norethindrone.  My cycles have stopped and although I have mild night sweats, decreased sex drive and some weight gain my quality of life is so much better!  It's been about 7 months; hopefully the side effects don't worsen and the benefit continues.",Anonymous

I have been on several other pill forms and have had a lot of trouble with them due to breast tenderness mostly.  With Jolivette I haven't had any breast tenderness (except during my period), but we are hoping that I won't have a period anymore after taking this for a while. Easy to take, although if I miss a pill it doesn't matter as I am not using it for birth control. I did have some bleeding to start with but my OB/GYN said that is normal. ",aj21allstar

Had no problems the first month, but have now been bleeding nonstop for 6 weeks. I really liked the fact that I didn't suffer from the side effects that I feel with a typical combination pill (weight gain, nausea, etc), but I cannot take the bleeding and pain anymore. I have had to take 2-3 pills a day to control the bleeding and am still experiencing spotting and cramps. I'm sure that this is the right method for controlling endometriosis for some women, but it is definitely not right for me. ",Anonymous
