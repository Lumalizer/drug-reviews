1,Lupron Depot,Endometriosis,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 12, 2021",0,"Just got my second 1-month-Depot shot yesterday. I can’t say I like it but it’s also not terrible. I have had hot flashes at nights or sometimes during the day, I wake up more often at night, usually because of hot flashes or sweating. I am not used to feeling warm, I rather feel cold quickly. Kinda nice to feel warm actually. Def not horrible. Didn’t gain any weight so far, had definite some sugar and carb cravings but switched to a sugar free low carb diet and feel much better on it. Also working out daily helps. I’ve had one real break down moment a couple of weeks ago but I am also in a difficult life changing situation so I wouldn’t completely blame it on the drug. However that was ONE day and then I was feeling okay again. I’ve had joint pain in my elbows and and a few headaches (I never have headaches) and I feel vaginal dryness. Def felt increased libido the first two weeks. All in all not too bad. No idea if it’s working yet but  I’m hopeful and would do it again.",June

It has been 8 years  that I have been in pain, 1 ectopic pregnancy and terrible pain every single period. To much medicine I had take  and it is a risk to my kidney function and no medication help me at all. I just keep asking how come I only had this Lupron after 8 long years in suffering the terrible pain. It makes me feel better and be able to do the things that I never ever been doing for 8 years because 2-3 weeks in pain every period. Now I can do all the normal activities and it feel so good to be up in the morning after having a good sleep and pain free. I am looking forward for my second injection.",Mimie
4,Lupron Depot,Endometriosis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 4, 2021",7,"I've been suffering from endometriosis and ovarian cysts for 22 years. After trying all the hormones, we discovered I also had fibroids and adenomyosis. My doctor performed a hysterectomy with RSO. Even with that, I kept having cyclical bleeding and endo pain. We agreed on starting lupron depot for 6 months with progesterone add-back. I was incredibly nervous because of all the reviews. The first 2-3 weeks were pretty rough. Migraines, emotions all over the place. By week 4, I felt amazing! As the first 3 month shot started to wear off, symptoms began returning and I couldn't wait for the next round. Dose #2 is coming to an end and I can confidently say I haven't ever felt better. This drug was a dream come true for me! We've decided to proceed with removing the last ovary and, hopefully, I can start truly living life.",Lash

My bleeding stopped and then started again but it was more like an ordinary period. I saw an increase in migraines during these first two weeks but I saw a significant reduction in migraines after that. I have zero complaints about the intervening 10 weeks. I’ve been period free, pain free, side effect free. I can’t remember the last time I felt that good. I’m due for another three-month injection in a week. In the last couple of days, I’ve started to have cramps and daily migraines. I’m very much looking forward to getting another dose!",Miso907

After my first injection I had a minor period and my second injection no period or pain. Coming into the 3rd injection being due, I’m starting to experience Endo pain.

7,Lupron Depot,Endometriosis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 23, 2020",7,"Lupron ruined my health. It made me depressed and have suicidal thoughts, which are not normal for me at all. I did not continue after month 4 and unfortunately because I wanted to stop the medication, my doctor would not see me any more. Please research the ingredients and side effects before you choose to take lupron. My doctor told me specifically not to look up the side effects.... Not wise!",Candy

The day after the injection I was in debilitating pain in my spine my hands & wrists & my ankles & it only got worse from there. The pain worsened as the days went by, I had trouble getting up I was drained of all energy was nauseated pain & stiffness in my hands & wrists to the point I could barely move them. I had horrible painful popping & cracking in my wrists & ankles & they would lock up & felt as though my bones were going to break. I had horrific migraines too. When I called my doctor regarding this effects they said it'd go away after the trial ended. It's over 6 months since I had my trial, & the pain & stiffness in my hands & wrists didn't go away. I now have tingling & weakness that spreads through my hands, wrists & arms. I had the laparoscopic surgery last month & I do have endometriosis.

9,Lupron Depot,Endometriosis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 28, 2020",6,I was put on this medication after laparoscopic surgery to remove cysts that was causing me pain. They found out I have stage 2 endo and recommended the lupron with the acetate pill. The first month was fine but the second month my period came early and never stopped.  I can deal with the hot flashes but I've currently been bleeding and cramping for 4 weeks and they just keep telling me to wait it out.  I'm due for the 2nd shot in July and idk if its going to help at all. I am depressed and the night sweats are a lot to deal with. I would rather have dealt with the endo pain 2 days a month than to have done this.,Jay
10,Lupron Depot,Endometriosis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 6, 2020",26,"I was put on lupron depot for three months for endometriosis. I received an injection every month. My treatment started in  January and ended the first Saturday in March 2020. The side effects weren't all that bad. I got my period on my dose but it eventually went after that. I had however severe headaches that made me dizzy, experienced some mood changes (mostly anger), painless sex, hot flashes (manageable) and joint pains at the end of my last shot. The joint pains are mostly in my knees and fingers but i only experience those after waking from a nap. Once I get up and start moving about they disappear. I now await my cycle to return. It has been 8 eight weeks since my last injection and signs of my period returning are back. I'm spotting and experiencing mild cramps. All in all my experience wasn't bad.

11,Lupron Depot,Endometriosis,3.0,,"February 18, 2020",23,"Ok y’all I admit before taking Lupron Depot 11.25 Mg 3 month injection; I read every review I could find. I was disappointed to find mainly negative reviews but I took a leap of faith and decided to get the injection anyway. Within the first month I truly regret that decision. In tough situations I typically look for the silver lining. However I was not prepared for the extreme fatigue (No more 5am workouts), hot flashes all day every day, night sweats that literally leave my side of the bed soaked (it’s totally gross), but the topper is body aching and hurting down to my muscles and bones like I have the flu...every day going on 63 days straight. I am 38 yrs old, good shape, active when I started the injection I was 115lbs, I am now 130lbs with no energy. Needless to say I am declining the 2nd treatment and look forward to 2-6 months when all of the side effects should fully wear off and hopefully get my normal life back.",Kris

I’ve been pain-free  from my endometriosis for 3 months, now on my third dose.After my first dose, I had some joint pain and severe hot flashes for a couple weeks, but those symptoms lessened as time went on.

14,Lupron Depot,Endometriosis,8.0,,"February 4, 2020",9,"My doctor told me about Lupron Depot, told me the side effects and I was weary because it's an antineoplastic. I started it along with the add back therapy of provera 5mg and had barely any side effects the first few weeks then I slowly started to gain hot flashes and some cramping in my right ovary where my cyst was. My period stopped before the second shot. I will say not to get it in the arm (deltoid) because my first shot was in my right arm and it hurt even a month after. I get my fourth shot on the 18th and I can tell you, the benefits will outweigh the negative side effects I'm having. So far I've had: thinning and loss of hair, my back and neck constantly hurt, hot flashes 2-6 times a day (mainly at night), vaginal dryness which causes a lot of pain during sex, mood changes (I cry a lot)",Ang
15,Lupron Depot,Endometriosis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 3, 2020",5,"I had a very similar experience to Lora C. I was a mess on Lupron and very much not myself. I couldn't control my emotions, I was either dead inside or crying, there was no in between. My night sweats were awful and I was mean all the time. The worst part was probably my memory. I had no recollection of anyone's name, I could recognize their face and the fact that I definitely know them, but never their names if I had met them after I was on Lupron. The shot also hurts like anything and hot flashes are real. I was consistently warm all of the time. Summer was unbearable. Also, the first few months were the worst endo pain I had ever felt. It was terrible. It finally went away after about month 4 or  5 and I was in a normal range of just feeling pressure down there. It wasn't nearly as painful, but always present.",KB

17,Lupron Depot,Endometriosis,1.0,,"January 20, 2020",16,"Lupron is a HORRIBLE medication. Many medical ""professionals"" are not forthcoming with their patients about all the side effects, or the long term side effects that continue well after Lupron is stopped. They also don't tell you it can kill you, or disable your life. This medication sent my life in a tailspin (of course I was lied too- being told all the positive, and common things you will find on any site about Lupron) I will never return back to normal. Just like so many others. I am now having to go for disability thanks to Lupron, and the negligence of of the doctor who gave It to me. Do IN DEPTH RESEARCH!

My doctor wanted me take get a couple of lupron injections so that I can have some pain relief as well as experience some of the symptoms I will be dealing with after my surgery. Well it's been 3 weeks since my first ( and LAST) injection. I have night sweats every night as well as a full aching headache all day long. The headache goes away with Tylenol or sleep but is back the very next day. So I'm hoping the headaches stop once this horrible drug is out of my system.

Had emergency surgery 3 years ago due to a large endometrioma causing a total blockage of my sigmoid colon.  Everyone's reports on here about unbearable pain and severe bleeding - yup, same for me.  I've been bleeding nonstop for over a year now. Received my first 1 month dose of lupron on 11/22/19.  The only side effect was a slight uptick in libido the first two weeks during the initial estrogen spike.  The last week of the month, I got my period but the bleeding and pain were much reduced from before.  Noticed an improvement in pain during intercourse.  I am on the add-back and have had no night sweats, hot flashes, or vaginal dryness.  No impact on my mood that I could notice.  Received my second dose, the 3 month long dose, yesterday (12/20/19).

Once I finish Lupron, I slowly have periods and each month the pain gets stronger. Last time was bad, but nothing like this.There's no way of describing it other then ""Roid rage"", I couldn't control my emotions. 2 1/2 months I was manic, I'm talking fighting fits of rage and sobbing on the floor. which is nothing like myself, I'm almost emotionless. Hot flashes, hair thinning, loss of sex drive. That last one which I hope doesn't affect you, surprisingly is one of the worst. Gained 30 lbs over 6 mths while dieting, Even with an extremely strict diet I have only managed to loose 2 pounds and it's been 2 and a half months since my last injection.All in all I'm not sure if I will go through another treatment of Lupron as all the side effects that affected me seem to get more intense each time.",LORA C

I am experiencing hot flashes, quite regularly but they only last 10/15 minutes so it’s something I can cope with and also I am going through stages of feeling quite anxious and depressed but hopefully these symptoms subside and this injection helps me for the future as I’ve recently spoken to my doctor who said this will help fertility in the future as I am 20 and have always wanted children something I thought was just going to be a dream when first diagnosed and had my fallopian tube removed at 17.",em

I would bleed all over my chair at work. I wear only    black or navy pants. So far I've  taken 3 shots and thankfully I am pain free. I have no period. But, the hot flashes are HORRIBLE. I'm  always hot and tired. I don't remember the last time I had a good nights sleep. I've  gone as far as putting ice packs on my bed so that I can sleep for a few hours. I've  gained about 35 pounds in 9 months, my hair is thinning I ache all over, my vision has decreased so much, I seem to forget everything if I don't write it down.I think I got the entire list of side effects, however, that pain before taking Lupron?

The pain was literally unbearable and I’d have to make a trip to the emergency room. Yes, I do have side effects from the Lupron Depot. Headaches, tired and drained, and for a few weeks out of my three month cycle, my body hurts so bad I can barely walk around. But these side effects have nothing on the pain and depression I was suffering before. I had no life at all. Everything revolved around my period.

Absolutely no side effects the first couple days, but pelvic/abdominal pain began day 3. My period came as normal on day 12 of getting the shot. I was really hoping to not have any at all. I will gladly deal with the more common side effects if my pain and period will go away! Only a few bouts of nausea and moments where I’ll feel so sad. I’m 39, no kids, and have been suffering with debilitating, life altering pain since 12! I’m praying this helps!",Anonymous
26,Lupron Depot,Endometriosis,8.0,,"November 5, 2018",15,"I will say I virtually have no periods and have had maybe 3 endo pain days that don’t come close to what the pain used to be. NOW the side effects are horrid! BUT I’ll take the side effects over the pain in periods. My bones ache not unbearable but uncomfortable. The night sweats bad but bearable. I’m tired lots but I can function with some caffeinated tea & b12 for energy. Mood swings and little depression/anxiety. It’s not intense depression for me like nothing that makes me want to harm myself it’s just more of a dark cloud following you around. So if you have mental instability before taking the drugs make sure you talk to your doctor. I did not lose hair and my hair did NOT thin/fall out. I did not gain weight. The side effects still make the medicine worth taking because I have no pain or real periods. I get the shot every 3 months (I’m on 9 months) and take a pill that comes in the shot package. The pill is taken daily, shot is every 3 months for me. Goodluck!",Lala
27,Lupron Depot,Endometriosis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 30, 2018",49,"I’m a 24-year-old female who’s suffered from terrible endometriosis pain; my periods left me crumpled up on the ground, moaning in pain, to the point that I seriously wished I were dead. I am not exaggerating in the slightest. Sometimes I’d get really dizzy and hear an intense buzzing in my ears, right before I almost passed out. The pain was unbearable; I often had to miss school and work because of my period. I recently underwent surgery and was recommended Lupron. I read horrible reviews about it for weeks leading up to my doctor appointment and was terrified to try it, but so far I haven’t had any problems other than hot flashes (and that’s MUCH preferable to the agonizing pain I used to be in). Of course, it’s only been a few months since I got the injection, so we’ll see...but so far it’s been great! Don’t let the reviews scare you; if you’re in good health like I am, you probably won’t experience serious complications or side effects. Hope this helps!",Lindz
28,Lupron Depot,Endometriosis,1.0,,"September 27, 2018",20," I had severe cervical dysplasia requiring a portion of my cervix be removed, chronic pain, PCOS, and was diagnosed with severe endometriosis following laproscopic removal of many adhesions from my uterus and scarring of my ovaries.

I started out with the one month shot and felt okay, a little achey and some hot flashes. I went back to got the three month shot. I was miserable but my OB really pushed me to keep going with it.

I stopped this medication after 9 months and even now, one year after stopping, I have residual digestive issues and continued vulvodynia which started when I was on Lupron.

33,Lupron Depot,Endometriosis,1.0,,"May 28, 2018",9,"I personally have endometriosis and have had laparoscopic surgery for treatment. I have been told by multiple doctors that adding hormones to your body to lessen your pain (in quotes because no birth control has proven to do so for my endometriosis) so I have taken no birth control since my surgery 10 years ago and it has gotten easier to deal with not worse! They also offered two other options to stop the pain hysterectomy/ ablation.. either way would be fine since endometriosis will and has eaten up my reproductive organs. After the laparoscopic surgery it did take me 5 months to heal internally, so if you do this option please prepare yourself for a much much much heavier and DIFFERENT period for a least the first two months. But after sex seemed easier with less pain and going to the bathroom (taking a bowl movement) while on and off my period was much easier.

Got on lupron for my extreme pain from endo and for the first month I got a horrible period like period then after that I didn't have a period. When I got off it I was prego and didn't even know. I got my rainbow miracle baby thanks Lupron and my endo hasn't returned since then thank goodness. Yes hot flashes, being sick in the morning, tired a lot because I couldn't sleep and mood swings from hell was all worth it. I will definitely be back on this if my endo comes back!!!!

37,Lupron Depot,Endometriosis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 8, 2018",20,I have been on the Lupron for about a year.  Last year I had 6 monthly injections.  The pain that I was experiencing before taking Lupron was horrible.  Within 3 weeks of being on Lupron I was pain free with very minimal side effects.  One of them was weight gain.  For me the weight gain was way better than the pain that I was experiencing before!  I went off the shot for about 6 months and the pain returned.  The second time around I received a 3-month injection.  The pain got worse the first couple of weeks then it was gone again.  Now I feel like I can live a normal pain free life again.  Still very minimal side effect.  This drug has been a life saver for me!  I read so many horrible reviews of this drug but honestly its been a huge relief for me!!!  I now can function again!,Kathy
