0,Junel,Endometriosis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 21, 2021",0,"This little pill is a lifesaver. I had been suffering from endometriosis and was severely nauseous and in pain more days of the month than not, and often had migraines. It got so bad I was barely eating because of the nausea and I was down to 100lbs. I was lucky enough to have excision surgery for the endometriosis and I will be on this pill continuously for life. It has drastically reduced my nausea and migraines. Bonus- no acne or mood changes like I have experienced from some pills. Warning though- the first month is rough. The symptoms were like pregnancy and it actually made the nausea worse. Give it time for your body to adjust. I’m grateful for this. It’s made me be able to eat normally again and I have gained 14 lbs of healthy weight back being able to eat. Highly recommend for endo sufferers.",EndoWarrior92

I will say it does help with the pain but I still get achy from time to time but it's better than having the pain. I am worried about getting blood clots I have read reviews where people say they gotten them for taking this pill for a long time, as I am sure I will be on for the rest of my life because of endometriosis. I wish there was a natural way to help with this but for now I will keep taking this pill because its working so far.",asia

3,Junel,Endometriosis,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 29, 2020",1,Love it. I have severe endometriosis as well as a blood clotting disorder so finding birth control options isn’t quite as easy. I’ve tried numerous birth control options including the IUD and nothing’s worked as great as norethindrone. I haven’t had my period since starting it and it’s helped HEAVILY with the endometriosis. Initial side effects are intense as your emotions are like you're pregnant. One minute I’d be happy then crying for literally no reason. That only lasted for a couple weeks. I am starting to experience minor cramping again Once every couple months since the endo is growing back but it’s not nearly as bad as it would be without it.,Dogmom123

I had very inconsistent, long, very heavy flow periods when I was a teenager and went on the pill for that reason, though this was not that pill. I switched a few times because of mood effect, weight gain, etc. With TriLegest I had 8 good years with a consistent, light and not too painful period. I moved out of the country and where I live I cannot get it, so I was off Trilegest for about 2-3 months and on some generic horrible Colombian pill that made me feel absolutely crazy, so I went off the pill completely. Also, I started to have terrible cramping on one side and pain during sex. I was able to get a new prescription when I visited the states and started it after about 4 months total of being off it but the pain persisted and got worse and then a week ago I had an endometrial ablation...",KES

There was a 3 year gap of trying other hormonal birth control, but came back and settled on Junel.I started on Junel 1/20 at age 14 to treat severe cramping, and it worked very well. Went from excruciating pain to a mosquito bite pain. Bleeding was very light and brown, which my doctor said was normal.Started taking it continuously (no placebo weeks). Had some mild breakthrough bleeding/cramping, but it disappeared when the dosage was upped to 1.5/30.Tried other hormonal birth controls because I had trouble remembering to take a pill everyday, but the ring/shot had bad side effects for me, and other pills didn't treat the pain as well as Junel did.AFAIK (As far as I know) I have no side effects. No weight gain or depression. I've tried taking breaks from the pill to see if anything would change, but all I noticed was that the pain came back.",Skye
6,Junel,Endometriosis,6.0,,"June 5, 2019",3,"I was on Loesterin for 7 days and I had to stop taking it. Loesterin made me so dizzy, and it got worse each day. I couldn't function. I do not know if it is a side effect that will go away. Loesterin gave me a much smaller appetite and no weight gain. I lost 2 lbs in 3 days because I did not feel hungry, at all. My breasts did not swell or get tender. I did have a mild - moderate headache almost the entire. I got no acne from it, my sex drive was beyond non existent the entire week, and my vagina was a little irritated. My mood was not disrupted and my emotions stayed in check while on it. I am not on birth control for pregnancy prevention, I have endometriosis and have to take a combination birth control pill with no breaks in order to keep severe pelvic pain and extremely bad menstrual cramps away.",MadHater
7,Junel,Endometriosis,9.0,,"August 7, 2018",11,"I've been taking this medication for 1 and a half weeks. My MD told me not to expect any results until after a full month but I've noticed dramatic improvement immediately. My endometriosis had come back after having a laparoscopy 7 years ago which isn't unusual. I was planning on going straight for another surgery but my MD convinced me to try this birth control first. So far I am extremely happy. I was at the point where I was in so much pain I could barely eat or work. I am going to be taking this medication continuously and if all goes well I will probably get the Lupron shot. Based on all of the reviews I was very afraid to try this medication so I just wanted to post that it's working for me and its working fast.Either way, give it a try if rx'd...I'm wondering if some of the problems people are having with the meds are actually just symptoms caused by the endo.",Junkette

9,Junel,Endometriosis,5.0,,"July 16, 2018",8,"Treated for heavy painful periods with cramping in between. Never wanted to use birth control, I don’t like the idea of putting hormones in my body. Starting 2nd week of 2nd month of Larin Fe 1/20. It seems like most of those experiencing bad side effects are switching over from a different pill maybe that’s a contributing factor.  Being my first experience with birth control so far I am loving it. No pain between periods, lighter less painful periods. Only side effects I have had are mini mood swings. 3 times so far where I’ll get upset over stupid things but the bad moods do not last very long. No weight gain, I lost 2lbs. I’ve read some women complain about hair loss but mine has gotten thicker and grown 2-3 inches. No acne yet either. So far I am very happy with my experience. I was very wary due to the reviews but this was all my insurance would cover so I took a risk and I’m glad I did because so far so good.

I haven’t been on birth control pills for many years. My OBGYN started me on this. Since I started, I have not stopped bleeding. This is day 24 bleeding, not spotting, bleeding. My iron isn’t affected because I take Iron tablets daily. This pill is the worst. The bleeding and the cramping and other side effects (back pain, bloating, mood swings). This pill is horrible. I’m going to my OBGYN this week to get switched. I’m done with this pill. I’ve read a lot of reviews of this pill and I’m glad I’m not the only one going through this. Horrible.

I haven't been on BC in years and was having some extreme hormonal issues. Anxious, depressed, painful periods. I am taking it for my Endometriosis specifically. I started getting migraines about day 5 and it has progressively gotten worse. I vomited last night and cannot handle any type of heavy food. I have the chills, seeing spots and am extremely sensitive to light. My stool has been soft as well. But my skin looks great and I do not feel anxious or depressed as of now. I've been treating my migraines and dizziness with a cold cloth on my eyes and relax in a quiet dark room at night instead of indulging in technology. I will report back if I see progress or not, but I am going to give it a solid three months. I will be taking Taytulla straight through, no sugar pills to prevent a period.

It goes to show how severely inadequate and ignorant our health care system is when it comes to women and this debilitating disease. Birth control does not fix endo. It does not cure it. The ONLY treatment that has a chance of curing endo is expert excision surgery by a skilled surgeon.  Laparoscopy is just a diagnostic tool. Not a treatment. Birth control can help some of the symptoms for some women. But it does nothing to actually fix it. Please ladies, ask questions, research your disease.

This by far is the worse birth control I've ever taken. Side effect out this world. First it was the cramping, then the headaches, then chronic fatigue even after food. What made it strange is the horrible mood swings making a monster. (Literaly) My emotions were gone, all I felt was anger & numbness.

My only complaints is that I do get random spotting for 2-3 days every month (hopefully that'll stop as I continue the medicine) and my acne is HORRIBLE.

One side effect that almost made me stop altogether was the breast tenderness. I do notice that I get a small amount of acne at times.
