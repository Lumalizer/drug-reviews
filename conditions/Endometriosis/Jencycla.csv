0,Jencycla,Endometriosis,2,,"June 12, 2019",7,"I absolutely HATE this birth control. I started taking it maybe 9 months ago and, although I am not pregnant, the side effects are awful and unbearable. I take birth control due to my endometriosis. I used to extremely sick in high school, I've passed out from pain, and have vomited countless times. I am 21, 4'11"", 105 lbs and my flow was super, I also had the most irregular periods. I suffer from migraines and my old birth control was exacerbating them, so my OBG/YN put me on progesterone only birth control. When I take this medicine, I do get a period. It is still irregular, my flow is not enough to fill a regular tampon so I use a diva cup. The reason why this pill does not work for me is because my flow is irregular, my cramps are AWFUL, and I am getting horrendous acne (which never happened before). Even as I write this now, it is 3am and I cannot sleep due to my cramps. Earlier today I got a heat flash and vomited because of my period.",anon
