0,Jolivette,Endometriosis,2,,"May 3, 2015",10,I was on this medicine for about 7 weeks and I gained a lot of weight and on the start of my 3rd pack I got extreme migraines when I crouched down. I was in crazy pain so I stopped the birth control. After about 3 weeks my migraines stopped. I got MRI's and the doctor didn't see anything wrong with my brain.,desireesmiles
1,Jolivette,Endometriosis,3,,"October 11, 2012",32,The longer I take it the more I bleed. I've had unexplained hair loss. I've been on it for several months now. The first two months were fine then the next two I had two full periods a month now I'm having three with no end in site of when I'll stop bleeding.,Anonymous
2,Jolivette,Endometriosis,10,,"May 26, 2011",18,"I just finished my first month of Jolivette and have no complaints whatsoever!  I have been on several other pill forms and have had a lot of trouble with them due to breast tenderness mostly.  With Jolivette I haven't had any breast tenderness (except during my period), but we are hoping that I won't have a period anymore after taking this for a while. Easy to take, although if I miss a pill it doesn't matter as I am not using it for birth control. I did have some bleeding to start with but my OB/GYN said that is normal. ",aj21allstar
