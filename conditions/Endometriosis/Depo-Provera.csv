0,Depo-Provera,Endometriosis,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 25, 2022",0,"I was on the depo from age 15 to 21.  I had no side effects (except for some minor spotting toward the end of the three month period), and did not have a menstrual cycle.  However, my last several injections have been ineffective.  I've been having a menstrual cycle with no bleeding, and tons of painful cysts for about a year.  I'm not sure if the formula was changed or what, but I've since switched to the implant.",boots
1,Depo-Provera,Endometriosis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 25, 2022",0,"It has helped me a lot in terms of pain relief I have little to no pain since starting depo. However I am on a high dose. I take 300mg every 6 weeks because when I was on 150mg every month I still felt pain. Only side effect I have experienced is weight gain, I gained about 30 lbs since I started it in late 2020. I have also noticed that my pH becomes imbalanced way more easily since I've been on it but other than that I'm grateful for the relief.",ANB
2,Depo-Provera,Endometriosis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 9, 2022",0,"Although my Depo experience was in 2008, I thought I would chime in.  I did not want to go on depo provera, I had been suffering with endometriosis for years and I had major concerns as I also suffer from multiple mood issues. I finally relented and booked a desperate appointment. I was to have 6 injections. When the nurse injected my first dose, her exact words were you’re going to go crazy for the first few weeks. WOW, great to know now that you’ve just injected me. Exactly 2 weeks after my injection without thinking I had a suicide attempt. I had also written a suicide note which I have no memory of. I’m not sure how, but I woke up the next day. Although very sick, I faked health to family and friends but could not get out bed. I was rushed to emerg a day later where the doctors where shocked I was alive. Took a year to recover.",Birdly
3,Depo-Provera,Endometriosis,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 4, 2021",0,"I initially started taking the Depo-Provera 7 months ago due to lengthy painful periods. Only bleed on the 2 weeks leading up to second injection. After 5 months, started getting horrible pelvic pain, ended up in the ED. Was discharged after 3 hours, because I was on the depo so they ruled out endo. Pain continued for another 3 weeks. Pain meds don't help. The pain stopped for about two weeks. Then it started again. I was sent to the ED again, and was told it is likely endometriosis. Was sent to my GP but was told I shouldn't be feeling endo pain on the depo. I still haven't gotten a laparoscopy. I am being told I need a mirena. Overall, the depo seemed worth it at first. No periods and no pain caused by periods is wonderful, but I am still experiencing endo pain. It really does depend on who you are and where you are in your life. Sometimes I wish I had my period back so I could get answers about endo ): I suffer from PTSD and GAD but the depo didn't make it worse. No weight gain.",hammy sammy
4,Depo-Provera,Endometriosis,10.0,,"September 12, 2021",0,"Depo Provera has changed my life for the better. I was never officially tested for it, but was thought to have Endometriosis. I used to get very painful cramps, nausea and vomiting if I was foolish enough to eat solids. My periods were very irregular, with only spotting some months but long stretches of bleeding other months. The longest continuous bleeding I had was just over two months. I had to have  iron injections because I couldn't get enough from food and tablets.DEPO Provera stopped my periods, and I now have no pain, don't need to regularly take time off work, can eat all month around, can work out and play sports without fainting, and even donate blood!I find going to the doctors once every three months very convenient compared to other birth control methods I have tried. I did gain weight, and have to lose it back and then start watching how I eat a bit more carefully.",Rachel
5,Depo-Provera,Endometriosis,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 22, 2021",2,"I got my first injection in January this year for extreme periods (lasting months at a time) and cramping (so bad that I used to faint), doctors didn’t want to do endometriosis discovery surgery so they put me on the depo-provera instead. Within 2 weeks of the first injection, my personality completed changed; severe depression, zero sex drive, anxious, irritable, gained 35 pounds, extreme fatigue - the list goes on. I stayed on the injection because there was nothing else the doctor would do. I can’t leave the house without putting in an emergency tampon in case I start gushing blood in the grocery store. I still have severe cramps and crazy random bleeding and the depression is getting worse. I finally switched doctors and have started transitioning off the injection and onto 5mg progesterone instead. Do not get this injection unless ABSOLUTELY necessary. Totally ruined a year of my life.",bek
6,Depo-Provera,Endometriosis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 8, 2021",1,"I freaked out reading reviews the first time I got the injection, but I've had a great experience. We're all different, and I just happen to be someone who didn't have a good experience with nexplanon, but loves Depo. I'm going on my second year now, and I've gained no weight. Most importantly, my endo pain is finally gone, and I feel myself. It even helped my insomnia, which I had no idea was related to hormones. The two side effects I've dealt with was smaller breasts for a couple months after the first injection, and irritability the day after I get the injection. That's really the worst of it.",Katie
7,Depo-Provera,Endometriosis,9.0,,"September 12, 2020",8,"At 22 I was diagnosed with stage 4 Endo. At 24 I had a hysterectomy. At 28 I had a Salpingectomy, and at 29 began Depo for the second time in my life after an incredibly painful cyst ruptured. I am 30 now and my dr and I know that at some point, one at a time, we will remove my ovaries. This info is important because I don’t have a lot of the equipment most women have when dealing with this disease. Pros: I was so estrogen dominant that I now feel stable for the first time in 15 years. My anxiety levels have dropped and, despite the craziness of 2020, am not feeling depressive where I normally would. My daily pain has gone down significantly and my intense pain doesn’t last as long. Cons: a bit of weight gain. I’m pretty active and healthy but have seen about 8lbs that are difficult to get off. My sleep has been more interrupted by heat flashes but as my body adjusts, that seems to be getting better. Overall, for me, Depo has been worth it.",AliciaMorgan
8,Depo-Provera,Endometriosis,9.0,,"September 1, 2020",14,"I have been on the Depo-provera injection for close to 3 years for Endometriosis. It has made a huge difference. Pain is gone or super mild. No periods. Downside, the injection site is always sore for a few days, as well as my legs after injection. I may spot for a little after injection as well. I can tell the injection is wearing off towards the end of the three months because I start feeling my endo pain and I start getting acne. Have I gained weight on the Depo? Yes. But I don't believe it to be because of the Depo. For one, these past three years I have dealt with a lot and I mean a lot of stress. Marriage issues, loss of a parent, moving, job stress, etc. I'm definitely an emotional eater. But these past six months I pulled myself together, started exercising and eating healthier. I have lost 30lbs!",Advent
9,Depo-Provera,Endometriosis,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 1, 2020",7,"I have been having the depo-Provera injection as I have endometriosis. It has worked wonders for me, after the first 2 injections I was spotting a lot, but after the third it stopped my periods completely- which were so heavy and painful. The only down sides are when I first get the injection I am really grumpy for the first few weeks. My sex drive is no where near as high as it used to be and I have gained weight, which the doctors tell you will only happen if you eat more. I find this not to be true, I have been exercising more than I ever have and eat so healthy all of the time. No matter what I am doing I can’t seem to loose the weight.",Niki

As someone who has struggled with endometriosis for about 10 years, it is nice not having a period...BUT I gained 40 FORTY pounds in 3 months. I was about 90 pounds and was excited when the lady told me average about 10 pounds are gained. I am 130 now and I have had to buy a new wardrobe. I suffered from an eating disorder when I was in high school, now graduated from college and recovered, I am starting to hate myself again. Not worth it.",Salem0
11,Depo-Provera,Endometriosis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 28, 2020",6,"I cannot explain how bad the depo-provera is. I got this shot once in Sept. 2019 and am still having horrible issues from it and it is now end of May 2020. While on the shot, I bled every single day until Dec when I had a huge bleed out. Since Dec I have been bloated everyday. Doctors now think I have an ovarian cyst that was caused by Depo. Also I have been extremely moody since Sept! My moods and anxiety are so up and down. Never had these issues before. Another terrible side effect is my skin. My skin is extremely oily and I believe this issue was caused by Depo. I've been through tons of shampoos and nothing will solve my oily scalp/skin issue caused by this horrible drug. I'm shocked the side effects have lasted this long. I'm not sure when they will go away. But this drug has cost me hundreds if not thousands in medical bills. Very aggravated. This should not be given to women. Skip the depo please unless you want to deal with all of this!",Never Again!!
12,Depo-Provera,Endometriosis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 1, 2020",1,"I am now about 3 weeks into what can only be described as a long lasting nightmare. The day I received my first shot, I started experiencing what can only be described as menopausal symptoms. Not only has my recently stabilised depression completely gone out the window, I also have constant hot flushes, fatigue, mood swings and nausea. A pharmacist recommended Clonidine to help these issues, but it's a cost vs benefit thing... Clonidine gives me a different kind of fatigue and nausea, but (somewhat) curbs the hot flushes, so I tend to only take it every second day. I haven't gained any weight, but I also haven't lost any despite actively eating healthier and exercising. My weight hasn't fluctuated beyond gains/losses between 500g-1kg.I can't wait for the next 10 weeks to be over. The only reason I made the decision to move over from Nur-isterate was because of a country-wide stock shortage. This will never be worth it. I'd take excruciatingly painful periods over this hell any day.",Tash93
13,Depo-Provera,Endometriosis,2.0,,"January 26, 2020",6,"I was put on the Depo shot a year ago to help treat my extremely painful periods. It stopped my menstrual so for  year I've been able to avoid the terrible pain I was in every month. However, the side effects have been awful. My whole face is covered in painful acne and I didn't have this problem before the shot, I've experienced terrible headaches, I've spotted the whole year I've been on it and had other discharge as well, my anxiety is through the roof and it has worsened my depression.  My advice is stay far away from the shot if you can avoid it. I can say its been nice not having the terrible pain endro was causing me every month but the other side effects are almost just as bad. I just had my last shot and will never take it again.",RayRay

If you already have anxiety, Depo increases your anxiety to an unbelievable extent and it becomes unbearable. My hair was falling out in big clumps. I had stomach issues for three months and lost a significant amount of weight. After meeting with a new gynecologist, my therapist, and dermatologist we all figured out that it was because of Depo. It also did NOT help with my Endo. I had a 19 day heavy period, the worst cramps, and brown discharge for 49 days (not an exaggeration). Please be careful.",J

19,Depo-Provera,Endometriosis,1.0,,"September 28, 2019",7,"This is a HORRIBLE drug. I have a blood clotting disorder, I was prescribed Depo-provera because it was suspected that I had endometriosis. The GYN who prescribed Depo said it would ""absolutely cure"" the endometriosis IF I had it. We still don't know for sure because the GYN refused to do a laparoscopy. I told the doctor I cannot take hormonal birth control due to my blood clotting disorder and my previous history of DVTs. She insisted Depo was ""safe"" and does not cause blood clots  This is an absolute lie. Within a week of taking the shot. I was in the emergency room with multiple blood clots in my leg. I haven't had an issue with blood clots for 12 years. I'm given this shot and within a week, I have a leg full of blood clots. Sadly, the GYN who prescribed Depo in the first place refused to listen and flat-out denied the Depo caused my blood clots, regardless of all the medical research to the contrary. PLEASE! If you have a clotting disorder or a history of blood clots DON'T TAKE THIS SHOT",Kdragonrose
20,Depo-Provera,Endometriosis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 28, 2019",10,"Best birth control drug I have used for my endometriosis treatment. I was on it for about 2 years the first time, and had switched to nexplanon but it didn’t work as well. I have since switched back to depo provera and have enjoyed the same benefits as I had before. I have never experienced any weight gain or lower sex drive from any birth control I’ve ever been on and I was diagnosed at 17 (I am turning 24 in August for reference)! This drug has been great as none of the other methods, including the pill have worked. This has been the only medication to provide any sense of relief from pain and ovarian cysts developing. This medication has also been the only drug to effectively put my body in medical menopause which the doctors told me I needed to experience a remission from endometriosis after my surgery at 17. I will never look back after using this medication. It’s also convenient that I just pop into the doctor once every 3 months for not even 5 minutes",Jojo

In less than a month, my weight went up to 10lbs out of nowhere, even if I tried to exercise and eat healthier, my weight would still be going up. I had terrible acne that left me scars on my face, no sexual drive at all, total dryness down there, horrible bone/joint pain (even while taking the corresponding dose of calcium supplements), even depression.

I've been struggling so long. My endo pain has gone down tremendously and I'm honestly surprised because I forgot what it felt like to not be severely hurting. I hear a lot that this makes people gain weight but so far I've lost 5 pounds! Now, this why I'm just torn between staying on this or not. I'm only in month one so maybe the negative side effects with go away but they are BRUTAL! It has given me such severe exhaustion that I can't keep my eyes majority of the day (even if I get plenty if sleep)!!! I'm so scared to drive and work is difficult because I will randomly fall asleep! I have to drink so much Caffeine to just barely make it through my day. Also, nausea is BAD!

Suddenly I started having large gushes  of blood while not on a period with the depo provera. I would spot for a few days then stop then a large gush, heavy enough to bleed through my oversize pad and my clothing. I have had many ultra sounds, MRI, and still no answer to why this started after being on it for so long. If anyone else has experienced that I would love to know if you have found a cure.

I didn't want to go through another laparoscopy (where they found adhesions, but wouldn't say it was because of endometriosis).  I'm about 90% pain free after a year of taking this medication.

In fact, after the first injection I lost 10lbs without trying. I think because I’m estrogen dominant, the shot keeps it in check. It completely eliminated all my PMS symptoms & evened me out. I went off it every couple years for a few months because of the bone loss warning. However, during the time I was off it, I started having horrible endometriosis symptoms. I now take it every 11 weeks faithfully & with the exception of the week before the shot is due, I am completely symptom free. I’m 42 & still weigh between 108-114lbs. The shot if anything keeps my weight in check by managing the estrogen. I’m sure some people have different reactions & the shot may not work for everyone, but for me it’s been amazing.",CJ

Absolutely NO cramping after 2nd shot, no more periods, and I'd probably rate this a 10 if it wasn't for the weight gain (not massive, but still . . . ) and low sex drive. Never had an issue with naturally occurring lubrication (if that's what you want to call it) but I do now. And I don't have orgasms like I used to. Worth it? Definitely YES, because like I said, no more menstrual pain AND I don't have to buy tampons anymore when I was used to using super plus size ones at least 6-10 times a day.

At first, I felt like I had the flu for a week or two. Almost exactly a month after getting the shot, I started getting a lot of spotting, and had to wear a pad constantly. After a week of spotting, it became a full-blown, heavy period, and my pelvic pain came back worse than ever before along with severe cramps, muscle aches, and even trouble using the bathroom because of the pain. The pain is far worse at night. I can't sleep. Ibuprofen and heat packs no longer help. It's been three weeks. My doctor isn't sure what to do, and others I've talked to said it took several months for the pain from the depo shot to go away. I'm in agony.",An Unhappy Customer
