1,Methylprednisolone,Gout Acute,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 7, 2021",1,Second time I got gout. My right big toe last year (2020) and now this time the back of my left hand. I have to say gout in your hands is absolutely much worse than the toe. I had no relief whatsoever. I went to doctor and he prescribed me the medrol pack. After the third pill (same day about 6 hours in) I felt relief I could just rest my hand and not feel any pain. I am so grateful to have this available.,Gout in hand
2,Methylprednisolone,Gout Acute,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 15, 2021",0,"I had my first gout attack right after my 60th birthday.  Woke up in the middle of the night with excruciating pain in left foot.  Didn't know if I had fractured it running up stairs or what.  Lived with it for 2 days.  Tried icing it, heat pad, Tylenol and had no success.  Called doctor on third day.  He looked at it and immediately said it was Gout (I have CKD).  He prescribed Methylprenisolone, which I took with dinner and within a couple of hours was feeling some relief.  By next morning pain was almost entirely gone, though if I bumped toe I could still feel it.  Day 2 it feels back to normal.  Went golfing.  Will finish the 6 day course as prescribed.  Would highly recommend this to anyone who has Gout outbreak.  No side effects that I could detect.",Jeff M

After the first three doses of the first day of six pills I could tell pain has subsided. After 24 hours and six pills from the first day waking up it was about 80% better less pain, inflammation, and redness had gone down immensely. If it worked that good on the first day the next five days it should be completely gone very soon. I would certainly recommend this skip this a 10 out of 10",Big Toe

10,Methylprednisolone,Gout Acute,10.0,,"December 10, 2019",46,"MethylPREDNISolone Dose Pack (methylprednisolone):At 43 I started to get acute gout attacks in my feet and ankle. I ended up in the emergency room twice in 1 month when I started on Allopurinal. They gave me an injection of Toradol and an hour or so later the swelling was gone and I was able to sleep and function. Attacks continued for months and lasted at least a week. Indomethacin, Colchine, & Naproxen have ZERO impact on reduction of the inflammation. Last night I decided I cannot take another $700 bill to the ER and did a teladoc session covered by insurance. The doc prescribed MethylPREDNISolone and within 2 hours I was able to get to sleep. This morning I woke up after 6 hours of sleep feeling like my foot is 95% back to normal. I am planning on working out this afternoon.  While this is great to be pain free it is not figuring out the root cause of the problem. I am looking at the gut biome in my own research and believe after looking at many studies I may have an imbalance in the helpful bacteria inside my body.",The Gout Guy

I believed that arthritis seemed to be forming on my left toes which progressed within 2 days to excruciating pain & swelling but only a little redness.  Of course Dr's office was closed.  Next day he confirmed gout & prescribed Methylprednisolone.  Within hours I got relief & 24 hrs later the pain was practically gone. Side effect seems to be some heartburn,Anonymous

Took one 20mg dose at night and when I woke up 60% of the swelling and pain had gone away. Took half of the original dose that night, 10 mg, and woke up the following morning with 90% of painstaking ordeal remedied. Great medicine!

14,Methylprednisolone,Gout Acute,10.0,,"April 5, 2019",10,"I’ve been getting more and more gout flare ups recently like  two a month, in hands, knees and big toes. There are days that I can barely walk. I stopped drinking alcohol completely, I watch my diet and I still get frequent flare ups. My Dr always gave me Colcrys and that usually did the trick, but lately my body doesn’t seem to respond to that medication. I went to a rheumatologist and she prescribes for gout methylprednisolone 4MG and it works I felt better within a few hours after taking my first dose. I had no side effects except maybe for some gas. I know by reading the reviews that some people may not have the same results because everybody is different, but like I said it worked for me.

The worst ever location of gout attack. Could not barely walk even just 3 meters to bath room.

So getting this for gout the first time I wasn't expecting much but hoping to be proven wrong after reading the reviews here. Not at all. My pain is just as bad as before. I should just let my gout runs its course instead, it would feel the same and be cheaper too. This crap is awful and a waste of money.

Woke up with that familiar big toe pain, by evening I couldn't walk, and the pain was so bad even after taking two aleve and a Percocet I was up most of the night in excruciating pain. Called my family doc in the morning and he called this methelpredsolone in to my pharmacy. My prescription plan picked it up and it cost me $5! Took the 1st day course as directed. Woke up this morning with only slight discomfort! I have never had a gout attack that calmed down this quickly. Usually did the indocin thing which took much longer!",Bye gout

I told my podiatrist and he suggested methprednisolone because I only have to take it for 6 days per episode and likely, it would not make me itch or cause ear ringing.  Well, he was RIGHT.  The morning after my FIRST DOSE, I felt relief.  The pain had substantially decreased and I was walking normally again.  After 2 days, the pain was GONE.  I still finished the dose as instructed though.  I didn't have another episode for 6 months and after my first dose during the 2nd, my pain was gone.

I overflowed the purine bucket.  I called my Dr. Daughter and she wrote me a script.  I took the entire first row as soon as I got it (per her directions).
