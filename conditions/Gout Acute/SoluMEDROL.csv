0,SoluMEDROL,Gout Acute,9,,"January 4, 2010",40,"Sometimes takes several hours to work after being administered but usually relief is dramatic. Best medication I have had to relieve the pain and swelling after an acute attack of gout without having a Cortizone injection in the joint. The injection in the joint is very painful but works quicker, but i.v treatment is the best route.",Anonymous
