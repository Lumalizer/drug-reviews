1,Indomethacin,Gout Acute,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 19, 2022",0,This stuff is my miracle cure for gout. If I take it as soon as I feel the pain starting it never even grows into a full on attack. 2 days of endomethacin and I'm good to go. If for some reason I don't catch it generally by the time I've taken the third dose the pain is down to a tolerable level and within 3 days it's gone. I'm serious this has worked miracles on my gout. Nothing else has ever touched it the way this does.,JimmyD
2,Indomethacin,Gout Acute,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2022",0,It's worked immediately for me when I have the beginning of an attack. One or two pills and it's all over within hours. Everyone is different though so do what works best for you. It also has a shorter half life than other gout remedies which is good for athletes.,Doug

12,Indomethacin,Gout Acute,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 21, 2019",8,I had my first gout attack which was horrible. And didn't know it was gout until I saw my doctor. He gave me indomethacin and it cleared up in a few days. This medicine is great. I figured out my self that shell seafood gave me gout. I had to think about what I ate and drank that was unusual and figured it was shrimp. I can eat fish but no shelled seafood. So remember what you consumed differently and you will solve your gout problem. Five years later I had only one shrimp from my wife's dish and had a gout attack. After 3 capsules it was gone.

I’ve been using natural remedies but it’s gone beyond those having any effect now.  (Goutrin, ACV, cherry and turmeric). Had a course of prednisone 3 weeks ago and it worked amazing. Thought it was over and gone but the flare up is back. I would have liked another course of prednisone but the side effects are tremendously bad for the body. Using indomethacin now. Starting day 3.  First 2 days saw no relief at all. Actually the pain got far worse. This morning (3rd day) I’m getting some relief. Pain mostly gone but inflammation still there. Hope to have continued improvement as this pain is absolutely insane. I guess I need to look at my diet and increase my water intake",Link

They key for me is to have indo on hand and take 50 mg with food right away at first sign of pain, then 25 mg 3 times per day after that.  Indo knocks the swelling, redness, and pain right down after a couple days at most.  However, if I don't have any readily available and have to wait for my Dr. to call in a script, then wait for the pharm to fill it, etc, it will take several additional days for the indo to knock it out.

17,Indomethacin,Gout Acute,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 30, 2018",10,"I've had Gout for the past 8 years.   Usually in my heel and various places around my foot.   I can't recall getting the big toe which is odd.   Over the years it has gotten worse and started to happen more frequently.   I got it in my knee for the first time and that has been a wake up call as the pain is tremendous and unbearable (I have a high tolerance of pain and this made me scream on occasion). On to  the indomethacin, started taking this to reduce the pain and swelling.   First dose gave me a buzzed feeling and made me tired.   After the few more doses (50mg, 8 hours) I started to get headaches and an overall sick feeling.  Spinning, hot/cold flashes, continuous headache,  insomnia, just horrible.  While it did help with the pain, after three days I couldn't take this stuff anymore.   It seems like it also has a hangover effect that lasted for another day.  I don't know if I can ever take this again.",Gout stinks
18,Indomethacin,Gout Acute,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 14, 2018",10,I've had gout about twice a year for 40 years. Before I got indocin I was in so much pain I had to crawl to the bathroom. Two indocin at the beginning of an attack prevents the attack. The swelling goes down to zero and I can walk without pain a few hours later. If I let it go and try to fix it after my foot is swelled up and I can no longer walk it will take about two days to fix by taking indocin twice a day. It's a real miracle medicine. To me it's about 500 times better than ibuprofen but it does cause stomach problems so I take also take a prilosec with it and I'm good to go.,Lucius

Went to my Doctor and he told me it was probably gout.  He prescribed indomethacin 50 mg., three times a day with food in your stomach.

105,Indomethacin,Gout Acute,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2012",44,"I experienced my second bout of gout, in my right foot.   I Was eating a lot of foods with a lot of protein, so be cautious everyone don't eat foods with a lot of protein. Like chicken, beans, lot's of meats. So when my right foot flared up, I went to see my doc. She told me it was from eating to much protein in my diet, so she prescribed me indomethacin 50mg three times daily. Within two days, my foot started feeling better. Within two weeks the gout cleared up. I would recommend this medication, to anyone with gout, or severe gout. Best of luck, I hope this helps someone.",Morton87
106,Indomethacin,Gout Acute,10.0,,"April 12, 2012",34,"Indomethacin for Gout, Acute: I have had acute attacks of gout in my right foot. So painful a sheet laying on my foot would be intolerable. If taken at the FIRST sign of pain, and not letting it get full blown I can cut the cycle off quickly (1 day). I also have shoulder pain in both shoulders. If I take Indomethacin every 3-4 days or so (1 75 mg capsule) I can eliminate this pain as well. Light headedness for about 8 hours is sometimes a side effect but nothing more.Almost my experience exactly.  Took 1 75 mg capsule @ 7 am, another @ 11 am, feeling light headed, but pain is largely gone.  Can walk ""normal"" again.  The first several times I took, never really noticed the light headedness...becoming more pronounced now.  No pain though!",Anonymous

Taking 25mg at my first opportunity (the point where I convince myself that I did nothing to stub my toe and it is a gout attack) quickly reduces the pain.  I have not experienced the stomach pains or paranoia that the previous post talks about.  I always take this medicine with food and drink as directed by my physician.,goutreview
