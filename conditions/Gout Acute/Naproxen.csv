I went to the emergency hospital in Vancouver. Usually I was treated by removing the fluid  by aspirations, which was painful and unhealthy treatment for gout. So after waiting for a long time inside the emergency room, I was given a NAPROXEN with some water. So today it's been 2 days only by taking same medicine, WOW, I can walk and help now.. Thank you lots.",Bhutan

3,Naproxen,Gout Acute,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2020",3,"Within hours of taking the naproxen medication I felt relief from my gout. It does what it says but along with that I had to endure the worst stomach cramps, diahhrea, trapped wind and gas all the time I was taking it. But I’ve not been able to walk well for a long time so discovering I had gout and getting rid of the pain when walking my agility back  is well worth it.  I also had a frozen shoulder which  I could hardly move and the naproxen got rid of that which was an added bonus",Lozzy

Next day all is normal and no Gout.",Anonymous

7,Naproxen,Gout Acute,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2019",6,"Using for the first time Naproxen, ( imprint = INZA 500) I'm in AustraliaUsual meds for an attack include;(1) Diclofenac (Volatren)75ml (2) Colchicine (Colgout) 500mic(3) Allopurinol 1 per day (I ran out 3mnths ago)(4) Tramadol 50ml last resort b/c its rare, VERY hard to get, and highly addictive. I had an attack at work which hit my top left ankle like an arrow. It only took an hour and I was hobbling, I took my lunch break ate a muffin and popped an naproxen INZA 500.

8,Naproxen,Gout Acute,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 28, 2019",7,"Just a quick comment.  I have had gout for 5 or so years, both feet, sides, tops, toes and occasionally in my knees.The only drug I have found to work is Naproxen (Feminax Ultra in the UK). Catching it early is key as previous posts, 500mg at start, and I top up with paracetamol after 3 hours, then take 250mg Naproxen 3 hours after, followed by 2 paracetamol 3 hours after and a 500mg before bed.  If you don’t catch it early enough, it can last days, my longest so far has been 8 days.  I also take cherry extract capsules daily, along with celery seed extract.  If you can find them, dark red cherries help flush out the kidneys and are a natural anti inflammatory, so once a week a top up of these won’t do you any harm, nor will bananas every day.",UkGoutyMcGoutFace
9,Naproxen,Gout Acute,,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 18, 2019",10,"Hi i'm 30 years old, I have had gout flare ups since I was a little kid some severe enough to cause surgery to have to be performed. I get flare ups in both feet from my toes all the way to my ankles. In some cases it has happened in my lower spine, I have taken almost anything under the sun to try and alleviate the pain, pills, teas and patches. Maybe my body chemistry is different than most but indomethacin is the best possible thing I've found for when the pain is unbearable. Yes there are some side effects, but we can all agree we wouldn't be here if we didn't know the piercing, debilitating pain of gout and when it's that bad a few little side effects don't bother me when it attacks the pain like it does, good luck with it.",Willy

Weeks of Ibuprofen with no results. Switched to Naproxen and pain subsided immediately. All swelling gone the following day. No side effects like the Indomethicin. Feet are smaller than they have been in a long time. Even my work boots are loose now.,AK
11,Naproxen,Gout Acute,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 27, 2018",7,"I'm 31. First time I've ever had an acute gout attack on my left foot big toe. This pain had me in tears. I'm a stubborn guy and normally don't take meds for anything. This pain forced me to find a doctor, who ended up prescribing Naproxen 500 mg. It works, but not as fast as I would have liked it to. I was still in pain 2 hours after taking it. Crying my eyes out. 4 hours later the pain was lessened. But not by much. Still enough for me to fall asleep. 6-8 hours later pain had lessened but not by much it was still uncomfortable to fall asleep....also a slight discomfort in my stomach (side effect?).  After 11 hours later throbbing needle pain that I've been feeling has subsided 90 percent.  I took my second dose and it's been maintaining so far. However, I still can barely walk. Hurts when I stand on it... it's been 2 full days with this gout thing.",Bebo

They have all been on my left big toe although currently this one is in my left heel. When I get a flare up there is no stopping it. Not indocin, naproxen, prednisone nothing! I take Allopurinol daily. Note* I just started taking Allopurinol this year and I felt like it was helping me. I made it to November. But here I am all over again. I’m am 6ft 245lb. I do exercise quite a bit. Have a active lifestyle. I’ve worked with my primary physician, podiatrist and now I’m being referred to a Rheumatologist. Hope they have some new ideas. I have  Family and Medical Leave (FMLA) from work for this, but I’m on my 7th day with this and it’s not getting better. I still worry about missing work. Stressed over here! ",GoutH8ter

18,Naproxen,Gout Acute,3.0,,"February 17, 2017",13,Aleve (naproxen):Slight pain reduction. But really not worth noting. It's the colcrys that really nips it in the bud when I feel an attack coming on. I've tried the aleeve a couple times when I didn't have the other media on hand. Just didn't seem to do much. Same for any other Naproxin sodium product.,Mike Mc Mickerson 54398

I am 46, active all my life, 200lbs, probably drink too much.  My dad also has the disease.  On the first occurance, naproxen had little effect even at high doses as is recommended for first onset.  Went to the doctor and went to the next level--Indocin.  Time and this drug helped.  I did not alter my lifestyle.I am currently traveling through the Dominican Republic and woke up with a sore toe.  Not nearly as painful as the first attack.  Went to the pharmacia and bought some naproxen and took a good high dose (880 mg (go big or go home)).  Two hours later, I could probably play football (soccer)...Will continue one tab (220mg) every every 6 to 8 hrs for the next couple of day",Vanman604

Found this site and read this forum. While still on crutches went to local Duane Read (NYC), took  some pills of Aleve at 12am and promptly passed out. Bottle states, take 2 max. Woke up at 4am, I can actually walk to the bathroom without crutches... it apparently took about 50% of the pain away. Still painful, still hobbling around, but I can walk unassisted! No crutches!

The best one I've found (and I've suffered for several years now) was Naproxen. My friends would give me a few pills and they would relieve it every time. Some other NSAIDs did not work at all.After doing a bit of research I discovered that Naproxen is a prescription drug. However, it is contained in Feminax Ultra which is sold over the counter for period pain only. I always keep a pack near me and take 4 pills as soon as I feel it starting. Works every time.",zubstah
