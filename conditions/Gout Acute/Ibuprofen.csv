1,Ibuprofen,Gout Acute,10,,"March 13, 2020",18,Advil (ibuprofen):I had a bad flare up with my gout.  I tried colcrys and indomethicin. I still had severe pain.  Then I purchased Advil 200 mg Ã—4.   That was the key in addition to the colcrys within a day my swelling went down and by the next day I was walking without pain.,Kev
2,Ibuprofen,Gout Acute,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 29, 2018",21,"Ibuprofen has been my first line of treatment for gout attacks for 30 years and always works quick and fast.  If I take Ibuprofen during the week for normal aches and pains it also seems to prevents attacks.  Every time a doctor has instructed to me stop taking ibuprofen before or after a procedure I wind up having a gout attack.  If I can't take the ibuprofen or any other NSAID then I have used Colchicine, it works but I get serious nausea and diarrhea after one day.  I get quick and complete relief from methylprednisolone steroid pack.",Bill in Texzas

4,Ibuprofen,Gout Acute,9,,"August 1, 2010",57,"Advil (ibuprofen):I have used Advil to treat my gout for years.  I start off with 3 when there's pain, then 2 every 6 hours throughout the 1st day.  Beyond that, I keep it within the recommended dosage of no more than 1200/day and I typically do that much for the first 3-5 days after an attack occurs.  I use the rapid release kind or it doesn't work at all.",psarq
