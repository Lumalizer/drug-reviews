0,Advil,Gout Acute,10,,"March 13, 2020",18,I had a bad flare up with my gout.  I tried colcrys and indomethicin. I still had severe pain.  Then I purchased Advil 200 mg Ã—4.   That was the key in addition to the colcrys within a day my swelling went down and by the next day I was walking without pain.,Kev
1,Advil,Gout Acute,9,,"August 1, 2010",57,"I have used Advil to treat my gout for years.  I start off with 3 when there's pain, then 2 every 6 hours throughout the 1st day.  Beyond that, I keep it within the recommended dosage of no more than 1200/day and I typically do that much for the first 3-5 days after an attack occurs.  I use the rapid release kind or it doesn't work at all.",psarq
