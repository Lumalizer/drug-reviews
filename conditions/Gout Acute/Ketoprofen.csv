0,Ketoprofen,Gout Acute,10,,"September 15, 2016",4,"I had intense pain and limp as a result of  the pain on my swollen left big Toe. It was  diagnosed to be gout. I tried couple of medicines to cool the pain but in vain.  I bumped into a friend whom I told of my pain being due to gout. He immediately told me his issues with gout far worst than I have. but he put his praise on this (Ketoprofen(Ketonal) medicine prescribe for him  in Kosovo, that made him fell better by just the first tab 100mg (he is over 50 year though). I went and got a prescription and took the first tab of 100mg from him at 19:00 (I am 48yrs), it is a miracle, next morning I wanted to challenge Usain Bolt for 100meter race :) I am following the prescribe dosage now from.

1,Ketoprofen,Gout Acute,10,,"July 6, 2015",6,"During a very serious bout of gout, I was unable to put pressure on my foot.  My doctor recommended ketroprofen and assured me I would be able to walk without crutches the next day.  He prescribed 75mg 3X a day.  True enough, I was able to go to work the next day and within a week the gout had cleared up.I now take a pill as soon as I feel a flare up of gout and within a day or two it is gone and I have not had a serious bout.  I just found out that the 75mg capsules are no longer available, only the 200mg and I am unable to refill my final 30 on a prescription I got last August.  I only take them when needed and was hoping get this last refill to cover me until 2016.",JepuLynn
