Works to 75% mobility and pain reduction in 12-24 hours everytime. For me this is a life saver. I don't view this as much as a drug as an herbal remedy. Its from a poison plant the ""meadow saffron"" from what I understand. The colcochine acts as a blocker.

31,Colchicine,Gout Acute,10.0,,"November 14, 2016",10,Colcrys works for Gout flares. Allopurinol barely gets half of Gout patients' uric acid down to where they stop having flares. Use Uloric 40mg to lower your Uric acid further than allopurinol could so you DONT have flares anymore because there will be less Uric acid in the body and therefore it won't be stuck in your joints hurting you. It's free each month if your Dr writes 90-days and you use the Uloric copay savings card ,Goutguy

65,Colchicine,Gout Acute,8.0,,"November 4, 2009",17,"I am subject to relatively frequent gout flare up, every 2-3 months or so. At the first symptoms I take one 0.5 mg of colchicine every three hours and most of the time after 2-3 pills the pain is gone. I also take 1-2 pills of imodium to avoid the diarrhea.It works fine for me",il gottoso
66,Colchicine,Gout Acute,7.0,,"June 7, 2009",23,"This is a useful drug but care must be taken not to take too much when trying to get relief.The maximum start-up dose is usually greater than that needed to create problems in sensitive individuals - or if taken with another (incompatible) drug. I took 6 x 0.5 mg tablets for 2 days recently for an attack of left toe gout whilst starting on Simvastatin (for blood lipid lowering) and ended up with severe diarrhea (without any stomach pain). This knocked back the gout attack also, but cessation of therapy allowed it back with a vengeance and two very bad nights followed.I have cleared the statin after 2 days - so will start low dose Colchicine again if needed tonight- but keeping to 1-2mg max dose in future.",trv
