0,Quinine,Malaria,10,,"April 13, 2020",11,"Growing up in the jungles of Brazil during the 1950s, I contacted malaria many times.  Quinine always got rid of the malaria, but the malaria would return almost routinely in six weeks.  Sometimes I would reduce my dose if ringing in the ears occurred, and the ringing in the ears would always go away.  I am 72 years old now, healthy, with no signs of ototoxity.Except for the pulmonary problems and the shakes, malaria mimicked the COVD-19.  Presently, I make my own quinine from the cinchona bark, during this time.   Does it help with the COVD-19?  I have no idea, but at my age, and since I work in a hospital that cares for victims of COVD-19, I’ll continue taking it.  If I’m home, I don’t take any, but When I go back to work, I resume taking the quinine.   I know it kills the plasmodium but don’t know if it has any effect on viruses, other than acting as its anti-inflammatory affects.  Thanks.",Jamie
