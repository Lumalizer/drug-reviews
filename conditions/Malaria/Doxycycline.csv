1,Doxycycline,Malaria,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 26, 2015",8,"I've been taking doxycycline for a month due to a trip to Africa, I will be taking it for a further month now that I am home. I get awful heartburn and nausea and would not choose to take it again. My parter takes an alternative, more expensive treatment with no side effect what so ever, I will be choosing that medication in future!",Cerian
2,Doxycycline,Malaria,10.0,,"July 30, 2013",10,"Doxy 100 (doxycycline):I liked using the medicine as a prophylactic. I used it for a very long period of time. Four years or more with very few lapses at all. I just had to remember to take a daily pill and that was it. I took it for three trips in two years in a foreign country and three months before and after the trips. I took a six month, 11 month, and 9 month trip with only a six month and four month separation. I also took it during the lapses between trips since you should take it 90 days before the trip. I had no side effects during that period except that I did not get a cold very often. By the way, it was all at a high altitude since this was in Afghanistan.",janderson5789
