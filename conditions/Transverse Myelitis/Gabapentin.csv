0,Gabapentin,Transverse Myelitis,5,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 17, 2020",3,I am on 3600 mg of gabapentin the max dose. 900mg  3 x a day.Nothing works for my illness but this dampens it down. On top of this I have morphine patches and sodium valproate tabs max.The worst side affect and there are many is electric shocks all over the body and chest pain.It's a living nightmare but what's available through the UK NHS doctors bible is better than nothing. I don't pay for my drugs.,Jamie
1,Gabapentin,Transverse Myelitis,7,,"September 26, 2016",8,"My max dosage was 300mg 3xdaily, it eased the worst of the neuralgia(stinging and burning) and even the numb/tingling sensation. However, it interacted poorly with all other medications I took. I could not mix it with Baclofen nor ANY OTC allergy medicines that were effective for me. Outside of medication interaction I had one side effect; not being able to orgasm, which was hard enough due the lack of normal sensation I have. I did discontinue the Gabapentin but only because I needed effective allergy control more than I wanted neuro pain management.",AnonymissD
