0,Valtrex,Herpes Zoster,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 25, 2019",9,"Would have preferred a 10 to 14 day treatment, rather than a 5 to 7 day. NERVE aggravation understandable irritation due to rash could be less severe  if patient was able to continue medication for an additional number of days. IF VIRUS is going to linger for several weeks then the initial first two weeks might prove beneficial. In my case, I would have benefited from the extra period. DOCTORS do not think so, but of course they think enduring the pain and discomfort is medical treatment. I think it is a wasted office visit.",Mike
1,Valtrex,Herpes Zoster,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 3, 2018",38,"Be aware I am anti big pharma on numerous levels. I fought using any kind of pharmaceutical for decades. I have chronic shingles that keeps occurring on my left back hip. A pinched nerve triggers when sitting for very long.  I hate to say it, but Valtrex saved me. Taking one 500 mg about once every 3 days, and have not been plagued with any shingles since taking it 6 mos ago.  It also seemed to relieve about 50% of the pain associated with the outbreak area. Not sure what the connection is.  I also have genital herpes that pops up every couple of months (before taking Valtrex).  Nothing has appeared in over 6 mos.  This drug has been a godsend (okay, I'll give the manufacturer a high five for this one, as much as I hate to say it).",Better World
2,Valtrex,Herpes Zoster,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 13, 2016",33,"Discovered rash on a Thursday, prescribed Valtrex on a Friday. Woke up Saturday and rash was still spreading but stopped by that night and began to dry up by Tuesday- no blisters ever formed and itching/pain was very minimal! Side effects only the first day or so, but not positive it was from Valtrex- the sickness/headaches I felt could've easily been from my anxiety. By the third day, any side effects subsided completely and had no issues finishing the medication. After reading stories of shingles sufferers who did not take anti-virals, I am so happy my doctor prescribed this medication. Also, a suggestion, Burow's solution (sold as Domeboro in most pharmacies) helped soothe and dry up my rash quickly! Keep your head up! :)",Willla

6,Valtrex,Herpes Zoster,10.0,,"August 8, 2008",65,I was able to take Valtrex within 14 hours of the onset of the rash and I feel that it helped suppress what could have been a disaster.  It has been three days on Valtrex and I am beginning to feel myself.  The rash suppressed it's growth and is beginning the second and third cycle of healing.,blkstn
