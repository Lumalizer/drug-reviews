0,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 6, 2021",0,"My nearly 92 YO, healthy uncle was placed on Valacyclovir 6 weeks ago for a Shingles outbreak on his eye.  He took 1 gm, twice a day, for 7 days (script was written for 10 days, but they stopped at day 7).  Three days ago, he was placed on Hospice, and is expected to die within several days.  He got every single one of the ""rare"" side effects: extreme weakness, no appetite, anemia, hallucinations, eyelid/facial swelling, difficulty walking, difficulty breathing, coughing, on and on and on...PLEASE do not use this medication with the elderly!!!",Broken-hearted
1,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 26, 2021",0,I’ve been taking Valtrex for about 4 days now for a mild case of shingles on my neck. The rash seems to be clearing up and is less painful. I have had on and off headaches and diarrhea though.,Gemineye
2,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 25, 2021",1,"Shingles of the eye misdiagnosed for 8 days--excruciating pain akin to acute appendicitis and childbirth except it lasted for 8 days.  Valtrex started probably 5 days after rash appeared.  I was 60% better within two hours of the first dose.  7 days later I'm 90% better.  I'm going to continue it for 10 days.   Valtrex saved my life, I couldn't have continued the way I was going.  I have multiple allergic reactions and intolerable side effects with many drugs so at 74, I only take a reflux med--tried going off it 4 times and just couldn't.  I see no reactions to the Valtrex except I'm fatigued--don't know if that's the Valtrex or carry over from shingles attack.",Judi
3,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2019",20,I'm a 56 year old woman in great health- I had some weird on and off annoying stabbing nerve pain on my right side followed by an itchy welty rash. I had no idea what it was but I decided to see my dermatologist because I wanted to make sure it wasn't from spiders or bedbugs or worse. He knew what it was right away- the dreaded Shingles- and got me started on Valtrex. I guess I started taking it early enough because it stopped the progression in its tracks. I had NO pain and the blisters never surfaced. I'm going to ask for a refill so I can have it on hand just in case it ever flares up again!!! My pharmacist said to make sure to take Valtrex with lots of water as it could cause kidney stones.,Loribell
4,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 22, 2019",17,"Valacyclovir is a miracle drug! My outward symptoms started in one little spot near my right eye, first with stabbing pain and then an itchy spot. By day 2 the outbreak had spread enough for me to start thinking it might be shingles so in going to the clinic right away it was caught early. I was on the antiviral immediately and over the next couple of days the rash spread slightly, then day 3 the drug really kicked in. One week later and I'm left with just a small spot where it originally started. My prescription is for 10 days, which I'll finish. I've had none of the possible side effects.",kergin
5,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 17, 2019",20,"I am one week shy of my 50th birthday. Shingles appeared on my left torso and abdomen. I was prescribed Valcyclovir HCL 1 gram tablet 3 times a day for a week. As someone that is severely emetophobic, I am terrified to take any prescription drug. I already take too many for various issues. Of course the internet makes it worse when you read about the side effects. I am happy to report that I have had ZERO side effects on this medication. Nothing!  My shingles started to go away on day three, and it is now day five. I still have them, but the medication is working!  No question! I think what helps with side effects is that I take this with 24 oz (3 cups) of water. I was told to take this with a lot of water. I am so relieved to have this going away. It is really debilitating!",Anonymous
6,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 25, 2019",9,"Valtrex (valacyclovir):Would have preferred a 10 to 14 day treatment, rather than a 5 to 7 day. NERVE aggravation understandable irritation due to rash could be less severe  if patient was able to continue medication for an additional number of days. IF VIRUS is going to linger for several weeks then the initial first two weeks might prove beneficial. In my case, I would have benefited from the extra period. DOCTORS do not think so, but of course they think enduring the pain and discomfort is medical treatment. I think it is a wasted office visit.",Mike
7,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 3, 2018",38,"Valtrex (valacyclovir):Be aware I am anti big pharma on numerous levels. I fought using any kind of pharmaceutical for decades. I have chronic shingles that keeps occurring on my left back hip. A pinched nerve triggers when sitting for very long.  I hate to say it, but Valtrex saved me. Taking one 500 mg about once every 3 days, and have not been plagued with any shingles since taking it 6 mos ago.  It also seemed to relieve about 50% of the pain associated with the outbreak area. Not sure what the connection is.  I also have genital herpes that pops up every couple of months (before taking Valtrex).  Nothing has appeared in over 6 mos.  This drug has been a godsend (okay, I'll give the manufacturer a high five for this one, as much as I hate to say it).",Better World
8,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,2.0,,"August 19, 2018",13,"I'm sure this medication works but I felt depressed shortly after taking it. Experienced periods of eerie confusion. Rapid heart beat. Anxiety. Felt like my throat was swelling up so I ran outside, phone in hand to take a walk and felt much better. Yeah, I won't be taking this one anymore...I am 29 years old, Shingles hit me out of nowhere!!",Steven

10,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,9.0,,"May 25, 2017",15,"Was feeling pain in my back under right shoulder blade for about a week. The pain meds I'm on for chronic back pain didn't even help. Stepping into the shower I noticed a rash and knew what I had... Shingles at 53—and no stress in my life. Never had chickenpox either. Called doctor next morning and given script. Took first two doses day after rash/blisters appeared. Been on for 48 hours (eight doses) and rash hasn't spread, but itching and mild pain persist. I could not imagine the pain I'd have had if I hadn't  been taking Norco, cymbalta, and robaxin already. Fingers crossed this continues to rapidly get better.",Bill623
11,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 9, 2017",5,I had shingles for 3 months,Spacy
12,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,10.0,,"November 8, 2016",21,I have recurring shingles brought on by stress.  The pain lasts for weeks into months and wearing clothes can be agony. It zaps my energy and all I feel is lightning under my skin. It's usually garnished with fever blisters in my nose and left eye and left ear. 3 outbreaks a year was too much emotionally. I take valtrex now as suppressant with no side effects. I recently had a very stressful event that brought them out of hiding and I quickly went to a treatment dose and withing 3 days the blisters were scabbed over and the pain never really got a chance to crescendo . IT'S been 6 days and I feel normal. The higher dose makes me a bit cranky but it's nothing like living with shingles.  I feel like I have my life back.,Alex the groomer
13,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 13, 2016",33,"Valtrex (valacyclovir):Discovered rash on a Thursday, prescribed Valtrex on a Friday. Woke up Saturday and rash was still spreading but stopped by that night and began to dry up by Tuesday- no blisters ever formed and itching/pain was very minimal! Side effects only the first day or so, but not positive it was from Valtrex- the sickness/headaches I felt could've easily been from my anxiety. By the third day, any side effects subsided completely and had no issues finishing the medication. After reading stories of shingles sufferers who did not take anti-virals, I am so happy my doctor prescribed this medication. Also, a suggestion, Burow's solution (sold as Domeboro in most pharmacies) helped soothe and dry up my rash quickly! Keep your head up! :)",Willla
14,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 17, 2015",25,"I give this a 10 for working. BUT WILL NOT TAKE AGAIN. I took it with a few hours of the first signs of a rash. 3x's a day for 10 days. SIDE EFFECTS NOT WORTH IT. I had nightmares, extreme irritability, felt depressed, nausea and vomiting. it hit hard and fast. felt depressed before I even took my 3rd pill.  I thought I'd try to stay with it and it would get better, I got worse. My very quick change in behavior started to affect loved ones. So I stopped taking it. I'd rather be in physical pain than the emotional turmoil I felt. I felt out of control of my own thoughts. last pill was taking at 6 pm. within 24 hours I felt 100 times better and happy and normal.",lavagirl
15,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,10.0,,"March 20, 2015",29,"Valtrex (valacyclovir):I started taking Valtrex 2 days after the rash appeared, it slowed down the spread of the rash and reduced the pain. 3 days later I was feeling better but the rash took about 10 days to disappear andIi continued feeling mild pain for another week or so.",Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

17,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 29, 2012",27,"Valacyclovir worked extremely well on the pain, blisters, burning and itching, but the nausea and headache were just as extreme.  I could only take the valacyclovir for 2 days, then decided the pain was more bearable than the constant nausea.  My doctor is going to try famciclovir and see if I do any better with the side effects.",Lisa E.
18,Valacyclovir,Herpes Zoster,10.0,,"July 3, 2010",32,"I started taking Valtrex within 24 hours of a small rash appearing.  The rash continued to get somewhat larger but then stopped (within 3 days). It never developed any further. I just finished the 7 day prescription.  No leakage, no pain, just a slight itch and the rash is fading.  It appears that the sooner you start treatment, the faster it clears up. Thanks",Anonymous
