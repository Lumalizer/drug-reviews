0,Carbamazepine,Trigeminal Neuralgia,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 23, 2022",0,"My neuro said that it would help because I have MS. So I had a bad episode of TN and started Carbamazepine.  Side effects which Itry to separate side effects  from MS seems to be hard. Because I have with MS gait problems,  constipation, dizziness, blurred vision, foggy mind and drowsiness. The one side effect that does come extra with the medication is I have to watch my sodium level. The one thing that is bothersome is I tried changing to other medication and well it was not good. I started at 200mg and now I am at 800mg. I take it at 4 times a day. And don't know why I forget to take it at times. Which when I forget to many times I have a reaction. The benefit of taking carbamazepine I have had a lot of days with no pain.",Hanny4
1,Carbamazepine,Trigeminal Neuralgia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2022",0,Tegretol (carbamazepine):Diagnosed 3 weeks ago. I have secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and have just learned that it's  common for MS sufferers to get Trigeminal Neuralgia. I started on 50mg Tegretol twice daily which worked immediately and without any side effects and it stopped the painful spasms. I was meant to increase to 100mg twice daily on the third week but I was confident that I would be ok at that dose but on the 13th and 14th day I started to get a few minor jolts so I have upped the dose to 100mg twice daily. The immediate side effect is that it works like a muscle relaxant similar to baclofen or lyrica. I find it difficult to walk or stand but I  can eat without any jolts so time will tell! Take care my friends!,Slats

4,Carbamazepine,Trigeminal Neuralgia,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 28, 2021",1,"I had TN for over 10 years and I also was on several medication, until I was introduced to Carbamazepine. My dosage is 300 mg two in morning and two at night. I’m the highest dosage that you can get, it help a lot and I know the pain that comes with having this trust me it’s not an easy road to never know when you’ll get a flare up.  What you have to do is take your medication faithfully. When I feel a flare up I take one of my pills early in morning and then resume taking the other one in mid afternoon and if you need more mg like the 300 mg ask your doctor and they will prescribe a higher dosage. 200 mg was not high enough for myself do not be afraid to ask for more because you all know how painful this can be and no one should suffer. This changed my life. As for the teacher please don’t feel that you can not teach due to the pain because with more Carbamazepine it will help to ease the pain and help you be able to talk to your students",Teresa

All of a sudden it felt like an electrical wire from below my eye down to my upper lip was burning.  The pain was excruciating. It lasted anywhere from 5 to 10 seconds at a time. It happened about 50 times a day. Sometimes I couldn’t even talk or open my mouth it hurt so bad.   After two weeks I couldn’t take it anymore so I went to my primary care physician, and he prescribed 200 mg of Tegretol twice a day. I started by just taking one in the morning and that was all each day. After the second day the pain was totally gone.

Then was outside in the heat 2006 and I had a pain when my front tooth hit together. Of course I thought it was my teeth. My dentist said it's not my teeth. GoSee a neurologist. So I saw my neuro.

I lived with the shocks that were building up in size. Til one day when my parent called ttyt he neuro and he gave me carbamazepine 200mg. It took half an hour to stop the pain.

Second time I started looking for stray current. Carbamazepine ER (extended release) definitely seems to be helping reduce the frequency of the shocks unless I was coincidentally entering a remission. I was prescribed 2x/day. This gets me through the night, pain free, but not through the day. I split the dose into 3x/day which seems to work better, but still not enough: I end up slowing down, sitting down, and biding my time until the next dose.Getting through the day is going to take a higher dose or other strategies. Looking at facial pain and seizure/ epilepsy web sites has given me two tips to help medication effectiveness: 1) eat something to keep blood sugar from getting too low, and 2) choose foods that are low in glutamate such as pears, apples, corn, or rice.",Leftcoast

That evening I tried to eat scrambled egg and the pain was excruciating when I tried to bite down on the food. The next day I managed to see my GP, explained all my symptoms and was given a prescription for Tegretol 100 mg twice a day. I took 5 in all. The pain is  gone,  dizzy and confused I nearly fell down the stairs. I started to feel sick couldn't face food. I stopped taking them after 4 tablets and will wait to see if pain comes back. I am not sure if these pills can be taken sporadically or over a period of time to work.

18,Carbamazepine,Trigeminal Neuralgia,,,"August 21, 2020",11,I thought it was a toothache happening in my right upper jaw. My partner recommended me to see my doctor we who referred me to a neursurgeon. He recommended surgery. I had the surgery and the pain was gone for 5 years. Then out of the blue the pain hit me. My home Doctor  issued carbamizepine but it took awhile to to take effect. They started to work and I was pain free for about a year. Suddenly pain returned. I increased the dosage but it still hasn't helped. The pain happened when I went to wipe my nasal part of my nose on right side. The shock went from there to my cheek and eye area. I was taking 2 pills in the morning and 1 pill at lunch hour and 2   in the evening. Shocks happen in the morning and now they are unpredictable. I seen the doc and said to add one more at lunch time. I thought it may be from drinking coffee as it has caffeine in it. So I'm cutting out any caffeinated drinks and see if its part of the problem.. Praying for everyone who is suffering from this horrible pain.,Lululemon

A wonderful night's sleep & a huge decrease in pain. I can still feel an attack starting, but the pain is getting duller by the day.This pain is the absolute worst I've ever experienced.

I got a mouth ulcer (never get them) then another. I could hardly eat, felt nauseous, dizzy and very unwell.

Now on Tegretol slow release (400mg morning and 600mg evening) it allows me to work but in some pain. I tried 600mg twice a day but I slept all day every day for a month. Breakthrough pain can be helped by taking tramadol and Co-codamol although only slightly. Overall good but it will leave you sleepy and forgetful - don't forget it's job is to slow the neurons in you're brain (I believe it was originally developed for epilepsy). Don't expect to be completely pain free and good luck.",Tinytoo

Eventually I became aware that I had tested positive for Lyme disease in 2005 but was never treated for it. I continued to have severe pain around the left eye that was incapacitating. I finally found a Lyme Dr. after much pain, agony, & suffering. I was told I had trigemial neuropathy in my left eye. I was given carbamazepine 100mg x2 per day.

Carbamazepine was prescribed. After increasing the dosage incrementally, 800 mg a day (500 in the a.m. and 300 in the p.m.) it  controls most of my pain. I still have touch sensitivity issues if I run my tongue over my lip too hard it sets off shocks. One thing you need to note: you may have to play around with the dosage and time of day you take it to control your pain. The first suggestion by my neurologist (100mg three times a day) didn't even touch the pain. It was only after I kept insisting that it wasn't working, he turned me loose to trial and error, on my own with an upper limit of 1000mg per day.",Found Relief

I was unable to simply look at photos of my children that I had easily done in the many years prior to this week, without any sort of difficulty whatsoever. Not really sure why it affected me in this manner so I went back to the Dr. He said that this medication is sometimes prescribed to help other people deal and cope with bipolar disorder, mania, and he mentioned a couple of other things too. I hope that this medication is more helpful to others that may try it for this purpose or the others too.",Enduronman
