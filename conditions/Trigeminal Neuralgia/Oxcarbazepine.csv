0,Oxcarbazepine,Trigeminal Neuralgia,8.0,,"July 14, 2021",1,I was given this medication for possibility of nerve pain. At first I was diagnosed 150 mg twice a day which equal 300mg. However after 2 days that didn't work for me at all. Then I was directed 300mg twice a day which it worked for about a week. Afterwards and currently my pain specialist up my doses too 750 mg. His giving me 5 days after 5 days no improvement he will up it to 900mg. I swear being in pain sucks but this is some good medication. I hope this helps.,Anonymous
1,Oxcarbazepine,Trigeminal Neuralgia,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 4, 2021",13,I have phobia when it comes to meds but suffering with trigeminal neuralgia made me get over it! I prayed and asked the Lord for some relief  & the Dr. gave me this  prescription. Tried this med at 300mg hardly no side effects just a little drowsy but as I continued taking it I could handle it. Helps the pain a lot!  One key to take away or decrease  side effects is drink a lot of water after your dose!,Jami

Symptoms included intense needle pain/stabbing in my upper right lip and it was painful to brush teeth, talk, eat, etc. I would even cry when eating sometimes, it was unbearable.     I started on Oxcarbazepine- 150 mg, 4 pills daily. I could feel relief after a few days.   After 16 months on the medication, the pain has  gradually returned and the doctor has increased the dosage to 6 pills today.  Hopefully, this will help.

I was off of it for 4 years with no problems and recently suspected that the TN might be creeping back so I immediately got back on it.

Recently started  taking oxcarbazepine, as their similar drug makeup to carba, was like for like. It worked fine and cleared my head from the small fugue (a loss of awareness of one's identity) that carba does. It went good for 3 weeks, then the slight pain, stomach, nausea and balance symptoms started. Dr thought it unrelated and gave me 3 types of medication to counter act the symptoms and increased my dosage from 900 to 1050mg twice a day. Then I started to have the worst 4 days of my life. It was like watching a junkie on tv with withdrawal symptoms only it was me. My wife said enough is enough and went back to carbamazepine and just took the other medication for a few days following. Two days later, it was if I’d just woken from a bad dream. Don’t get me wrong, but I still get pain, but it’s manageable.",Gep

I woke last night and had a seizure followed by copious vomiting. I couldn't find any information online on how to reduce the side effects (though some people recommend Gatorade, which I will try.)My doctor switched me to carbamazepine today, but I am unable to eat and the carbamazepine must be taken with food.

16,Oxcarbazepine,Trigeminal Neuralgia,,,"February 21, 2019",9,"I used Carbamazepine for three separate TN attacks since 2015 with minimal side effects using a minimum dose.  I have congestive heart failure and need to take Torsemide, a water pill.  While in remission, and not taking Carbamazepine, my cardiologist thought my ankles looked too swollen and changed the Torsemide from 20 to 40 mg/day.  Within 6 days my TN started coming back.  I researched and found that Torsemide can lower the potassium to sodium ratio in your kidneys.  This can make your nerves more sensitive.  The cardiologist had me go back to 20 mg /day.  I also started taking 4 over the counter potassium pills per day.  Within 6 days my TN had gone back into remission without taking Carbamazepine.  I now take 20 mg Torsemide and one potassium pill per day and am still in remission.  So you might try taking Potassium supplement to see if it helps.  By the way, the Sodium to Potassium ratio you get in a blood test is not necessarily the same ratio you have in your kidneys.",Dave

18,Oxcarbazepine,Trigeminal Neuralgia,8.0,,"April 7, 2018",22,"In September 2017 the TN came back full force with pain lasting 1-2 minutes then lingering afterwards. Pain is along all my upper teeth on the right and sometimes it'll tingle to my chin, nose and temple. I went about 3 months without medication. Oxcarbazepine is the only medicine I've been on and it works well but I'm not pain free. It took about 2-3 weeks to get good results on the medicine. I'm up to 1 pill (150mg) 6x a day or every 4 hours. I have none of the listed side effects but I cannot miss or be late on the medication. If I am, then it will take about 1 week for the medication to become effective again. I have had to increase my water intake, my appetite has changed some and I've gained weight (but I'm also on Birth control). I think eating more and drinking more water helps (old school). My neurologist said I may need to add salt to my diet to combat the sodium decrease I could experience. An MRI and blood test was conducted before the medication was prescribed.",Autumn B

At first, I got a headache, which didn't last too long, so I didn't take anything for the headache.  What concerns me the most is that lately I have been getting pain on my ankles the next day after doing a 45 min kickboxing work-out and it's not going away, which I never had before. Today for the first time in my life I had a terrible pain on my pelvis that I couldn't hardly walk .  Hopefully the pain goes away soon, and I won't have to take anything, 'until next year'!",Anonymous
52,Oxcarbazepine,Trigeminal Neuralgia,10.0,,"September 29, 2011",66,"This has helped me tremendously. No face pain at all having Trigeminal Disorder. The pain can make you crazy. No pain pills helped at all. Take 450 mg every night and go right to sleep. Slept in a chair for 6 weeks keeping my head up and not being able to lay down in my bed to sleep. Cried every night with pain. Feel a little drowsy, fatigued and weakness some days but I'd rather deal with that instead of the pain. It's been two months now and I feel so much better. Good luck to all.",Happy in NY

I was first prescribed Tegretol and it worked for about a year but then the pain started to return. Doc said the Tegretol was being metabolized at a faster rate and she switched me to Trileptal. It worked in about 8 hours! And, as others have noted, you do struggle for words and have a bit of short-term memory impairment, but the pain is gone! Also, so is your libido! Tegretol was like taking Viagra, increased libido! But, it's still a better life without the pain.",Jod123

This is not the typical TGN since it was caused by a stress ulcer about 3/4"" from the left side of my mouth over the junction of three facial nerves.  About a year after the ulcer healed, the facial pain abruptly developed big time.  I was first prescribed Tegretol, but made me feel like a dope.  Trileptal was  then prescribed and I have cut it down to only 75 mg at night.  Occasionally take 150 mg Trileptol 1 X when my facial pain really tunes up.  Also rub in a little dab of Metrocream topically over that painful area that numbs my face just enough to minimize any pain.  ",Anonymous

Much less problems with taking and no Tegretol level or white blood cell counts needed, and I can take a lesser dose mostly get by with 2 a day with the other medicine it was min of 3 but mostly 4 a day.
