0,Tegretol,Trigeminal Neuralgia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2022",0,Diagnosed 3 weeks ago. I have secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and have just learned that it's  common for MS sufferers to get Trigeminal Neuralgia. I started on 50mg Tegretol twice daily which worked immediately and without any side effects and it stopped the painful spasms. I was meant to increase to 100mg twice daily on the third week but I was confident that I would be ok at that dose but on the 13th and 14th day I started to get a few minor jolts so I have upped the dose to 100mg twice daily. The immediate side effect is that it works like a muscle relaxant similar to baclofen or lyrica. I find it difficult to walk or stand but I  can eat without any jolts so time will tell! Take care my friends!,Slats
1,Tegretol,Trigeminal Neuralgia,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 7, 2021",1,Ive been living with TN for a month. I have MS as well (19+ years). ER visit put me me on Tegretol 600 mg a day. Just want to go back to same strength I had before Tegretol. Will have to wait and see. No pain of TN in meantime. Will take the muscle weakness for now.,Brand new here
2,Tegretol,Trigeminal Neuralgia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 10, 2020",8,Just out of hospital blew up like a balloon had very bad reaction. In hospital for 3 days was on tabs for 4 weeks  so am off them now. No good for me as I was swelled up like a beach ball on them. A neurologist told me to go on them for 8 weeks gees after 4 weeks ended up in hospital taking 3 to 5 a day.,T
3,Tegretol,Trigeminal Neuralgia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 5, 2019",31,"After 5 long years of incorrect diagnosis, unnecessary dental and ear surgeries, I was finally diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN) about 12 months ago and put on 3 x 200mg of Tegretol daily.I have had horrific side effects with serious changes to my menstrual cycle (8 week non stop bleeding) but it is still better than living with the TN episodes that I would have almost daily.I have recently been having milder episodes and may have to try something else.",LF
4,Tegretol,Trigeminal Neuralgia,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 18, 2019",44,"I think Tegretol (Carbamazepine) is a wonder drug for trigeminal neuralgia (TN or TGN) pain. That being said, the side effects are horrible. I was doing well on it-- but suddenly, the spaciness has returned with memory loss, intense lassitude, drowiness, weight gain, constipation; I am going to have to reduce dose. Not sure whether to notify doctor(s) first, or not (as I plan to do it, anyway! as I simply cannot function.) I guess I will leave them a message with office staff; it's impossible to get a doctor to call back. I plan to reduce it by 100 mg slowly the same way I started which was to slowly increase the dose. However, I will only reduce it by 100 mg., until I can see doctor. Wish me luck!",Spacey
5,Tegretol,Trigeminal Neuralgia,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 5, 2018",27,"I've been living with unbearable pain for 3 years. My official diagnosis is trigeminal neuralgia, although I'm still not sure the diagnosis is correct. Like many others, I've had endless dental procedures to no avail. They tried to put me on Tegretol and other anticonvulsants, but I can't tolerate it. The pain went away like magic from the first pill but the side effects were unbearable. It's as if someone hands you a life jacket and then it blows up in your face. I get a horrific state of agitation that lasts for many hours. I have to move, hit, kick, to relieve this madness (akathisia).  My question: can I have relief from pain with Tegretol if the pain is caused by something ELSE (such as a dental implant, in my case)? Or is the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia definitive if the pain goes away? Thank you.",TrigeminalOrNot
6,Tegretol,Trigeminal Neuralgia,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 3, 2018",23,"Been taking 3x day for several years. Suffered on and off for decades from head/facial pain with no diagnosis. Finally went to good neurologist. Tried gabapentin. Didn't work at all. (Neither does Dilaudid) This does make me groggy still and I have nausea, brain-drain and more. I would take any side effect for relief from that horrific pain.  I've had it so bad, I literally couldn't breathe in. The break through pain I now gets is mainly an ache in my ear and sometimes teeth. The side effects also may be from the 15 other meds I take for various problems.",CrossWalker
7,Tegretol,Trigeminal Neuralgia,,,"January 25, 2018",23,"While I've taken tegretol in the past with no issues, this time is different.  First time around no side effects. This time - possibly due to other medication - I've had horrible side effects. Headaches every day, dizziness, nausea to the point of not even enjoying a glass of water. Lightheadedness, unsteady on your feet -going for a walk with my friend the other day I MUST have looked like a drunk. TBH -this time around I'd rather have the nerve pain.",Felicia3127
8,Tegretol,Trigeminal Neuralgia,9.0,,"November 10, 2017",27,"I have been on tegretol for seven years now,I still have general pain with the occasional flair up of unbearable pain that I had before taking this medication.  I am also on a high dose of folic acid as I became very anemic, this caused tiredness.  It was just by chance I was diagnosed with TN after being in extreme pain for over 6 months, many doctors and tests one specialist just said it could be this, let's try this drug it may not work but if it does we are on the right track.  To be honest with you if she said I needed to cut off a limb to ease the pain at that point I would have asked for the knife.  I was miserable the pain was unbearable and so was I.  I do feel it is not working as well after all these years may be due for review.",SarahD-uk
9,Tegretol,Trigeminal Neuralgia,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 29, 2017",31,"Diagnosed with TN about a week ago.  I tore a Cartilage in my right knee, which I thought was painful. Well, nothing compares to TN, rather have a daily torn cartilage than this terrible pain.Ended up in hospital being given Morphine, Diazepam, and a Diclophenac Suppository, which is not the most enjoyable method of administration.Doctor has prescribed Tegretol. This has provided some relief, in as much the frequency of the episodes has reduced, but not the severity, which has not been attenuated in any way. At least I can function better than last week. Though now I do feel a bit zombiefied, and as I am unemployed looking for work this does give me some apprehension how I am going to cope with pain, sedation, and interviews.I am a Brit",Wiyaka Sapa

Now on 1000mg Gapapentin 3x a day plus prolonged release Carbamazapine 400mg at night.  Did start 100mg Carbamazapine in the morning but had problems with vision and balance so decided against it.

13,Tegretol,Trigeminal Neuralgia,5.0,,"June 20, 2016",37,"I started taking Tegretol for TN and it did greatly improve my ability to function. Pain was much duller during episodes and had stopped being totally debilitating. 6-7 weeks after use I began to be so lethargic I couldn't get out of bed and was relying so much more on my husband to see to our toddler son. It was very worrying. I then developed severely enlarged glands under my chin, lumps on my neck and started to feel generally unwell. I then had a full blood count done and it returned a very low white blood and abnormal looking cells also. Enlarged spleen also occurred. Now being referred to haematology and had to be taken off Tegretol as they believe I am taking quite a severe reaction to it.",AnnieMoooo

I've been on the generic form of Tegretol (Carbamazepine) 100 mg 3x per day for 3 weeks.  I still have episodes of pain a couple times a day, but at least I can walk around, talk and eat without the excruciating pain I had been experiencing.

Eventually I became aware that I had tested positive for Lyme disease in 2005 but was never treated for it. I continued to have severe pain around the left eye that was incapacitating. I finally found a Lyme Dr. after much pain, agony, & suffering. I was told I had trigemial neuropathy in my left eye. I was given carbamazepine 100mg x2 per day.

It does a good job in limiting the amount of pain I have with Trigeminal Neuralgia. I found it best to take the medication regularly. If I skip days when I am not having problems the pain will be right back and it will take several days to get it back under control. I've tried GABAPENTIN 300mg and OXCARBAZEPINE 150mg but they did not help. The CARBAMAZEPINE makes me tired and sleepy but that is a lot better than the pain.,ggrantland
