1,Phenytoin,Trigeminal Neuralgia,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 7, 2017",5,"I am taking Dilantin and Tegretol, for trigeminal neuralgia, I had what they called breakthrough pain and that was my Neurologist put me on Dilantin. I have been on both for close to a year or so now, but I am finding out that I seem to be reacting both or one but I do not know which one I am reacting to. The pain is gone but I am fighting with the side effects of which drug I am unsure as they ave similar side effects.",AKRIKA
2,Phenytoin,Trigeminal Neuralgia,8.0,,"May 6, 2011",43,Dilantin (phenytoin):I have been on this medication for years. I do not take it on a daily basis. When pain pills do not work so good I take a Dilantin to help stop the pain. I have found if you take any of the medications for this disorder your body gets used to it and have to up the dose. I also take Ativan at night if I am not able to sleep because of pain and do not take it every night because my body will get used to it. This is the worst thing I think a person can get and have to live with because it is like getting beat in the face everyday all day long. Oh and do not have your tooth pulled thinking it will get better ... because I have pulled all mine and still have the same pain. ,CAJUNBEE

4,Phenytoin,Trigeminal Neuralgia,,,"October 16, 2009",22,Dilantin (phenytoin):Stops the pain but makes me too dizzy to function. My doctor also doesn't like the long term effects on the cerebellum.,msbarch
