1,Gabapentin,Trigeminal Neuralgia,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 30, 2021",0,"I was diagnosed with TN about two years ago. At first I tried Gabapentin but I didn't find the relief that others here are talking about. I switched to carbamazepine which calmed my face. However I was non functional and high as a kite while awake, but sleeping all day. I just noticed that the dose for gabapentin my doctor has me on is only 200mg 2X a day. This seems low based on others reviews. What worked for me was botox in the jaw muscles. I get it ever 6-7 months, and it works wonders after a week.",MIstaadams
2,Gabapentin,Trigeminal Neuralgia,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 18, 2021",0,"I was diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia in Feb 2021 (I am 50) and prescribed Carbamazepine, which caused an allergic reaction. Then I was placed on Gabapentin and slowly increased my dosage as it did nothing for my pain. At 900mg/day I still had no pain relief but my blood pressure dropped to just about 90/60. I also began experiencing tingling in my hands and feet. My dose was decreased to 600mg/day and we waited to see if it would provide relief.  I became so fatigued and had such trouble concentrating I had to quit my job in June 2021. When the tingling became ""zaps"" accompanied by muscle aches and joint pain we began eliminating my dose. In Sep 2021 I have been off Gabapentin for a month. My fatigue and concentration are greatly improved, but I still have the tingling/aches/pain. I am told, although uncomfortable - it is not life threatening and may take months for it to completely heal. It very rarely is ever permanent. This side-effect, although known, is also extremely rare.",aniseday
3,Gabapentin,Trigeminal Neuralgia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 31, 2021",1,"I was prescribed Gabapentin for TN as I am allergic to Carbamazepine. Initially (at 100mg 3 x day) I felt jittery but that subsided after a week or so. Once at 300mg 3 x day I began experiencing pins & needles in my arms/hands and legs/feet. My dose was reduced to 200mg x 3 and 5mg Baclofen added. The pins & needles remained in my arms/hands - which was more severe while driving (hands at 2 and 10). This was/is perplexing because that is the type of pain this drug is supposed to eliminate. As I stepped down to 100mg x 3 the jittery feeling returned. Through all this the TN pain was not reduced at all and the pins & needles remains. If you have Type 2 TN, which I do - before you start Gabapentin I would try to assess when your MD feels you should begin to notice a change in the pain. If it doesn't budge at that point in time - I would ask to stop taking this. I am now on 5mg Baclofen 2xday and although pain remains - it hasn't gotten worse which is a blessing with this disease.",desertburro
4,Gabapentin,Trigeminal Neuralgia,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 27, 2021",5,"I have been taking Gabapentin (Neurontin) for over 5 years, 300mg, 2x daily.  It was prescribed by my rheumatologist for fibromyalgia pain originally.  It helped immensely, but was no help with the trigeminal neuralgia, which I've had from childhood. Of course, the TN was not diagnosed until I was 70, after many bouts of extreme facial and dental pain.  Luckily the dentist sent me to a surgeon who said I needed to see a neurologist.  She prescribed Carbamazepine, which helped briefly, but soon I developed side effects.  I had gotten to the point where the TN attacks were occurring every two to three weeks.  Now I am on Baclofen 10mg, 3x daily, and it has just about knocked out the attacks.  I still take my Gabapentin without fail, daily.  I learned the hard way that without them, I have pain all over from the fibromylgia and now rheumatoid arthritis.  It probably kept the TN pain controlled for many years.",Cat Lady Di

She takes 3600 mg/day (two 300 mg every 4 hrs.).  If she has a flare up (severe shooting pain in jaw area/face) - she takes 3 capsules right away, and it’s the only thing that stops the pain.

8,Gabapentin,Trigeminal Neuralgia,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 11, 2019",28,"Gabapentin has taken my Trigeminal neuralgia pain, which was a 9/10, down to a 2/10. Gabapentin has also greatly decreased the frequency of my pain. Gabapentin is also infinitely more effective than Tegretol for my pain, and with far less side effects. I couldn’t leave my house when it was under 30° because any breeze would set off the neuralgia pain in my teeth. I started 600mg in the morning and afternoon, and I take 1200mg at night as well. I don’t have any side effects from Gabapentin, but I was taking it for sleep for ten years before I started it during the day.",Lovely
9,Gabapentin,Trigeminal Neuralgia,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 19, 2019",10,"In June of 2018 I was prescribed 300mg/ day of Gabapentin after having allergic reactions to other  more effective drugs used to relieve the trigeminal nerve pain. Through the course of the next 6 months my dosage was increased to 3600/mg/day. Over that time period I began to experience pain in my feet,  I'm on NO other medication. In Jan. 2019 I underwent  Microvascular decompression (MVD) surgery so have been weaned off Gabapentin. I told neurologist about my neuropathy in feet but it was always discounted. Now, I have continued neuropathy in feet, hoping it will go away.",Ally
10,Gabapentin,Trigeminal Neuralgia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 8, 2019",28,I have suffered from TN for many years undiagnosed. The pain is simply agonising and no pain killer including morphine has even touched it. I have recently suffered a particularly bad attack and ended up in A and E . The doc thought it may be TN and prescribed Gabapentin. 300 mg 3 x a day within 4 hours of the first dose the pain started to ease. By the next day it was probably 75%  better after a few days and raising the dose to 1200mg per day the pain was gone. I also suffer from fistulating crohns and AS. I have also found some relief with pain related to these issues. For the first time in 20 years I am not reliant on opioid pain killers to get through the day. For the first few days side effects were quite strong but worth it. I have been lucky for me this drug is a miracle. Its been a short time so I'm not sure if things will continue to go so well. But for the moment I feel better than I have in years.,Lazlo45
11,Gabapentin,Trigeminal Neuralgia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 30, 2018",19,"Everyone is different. I was on this for many years and the side effects do go away for most people. But I have trigeminal  neuralgia and this is the most painful condition that someone can have (They call it the suicide disease because before treatments came out about 50% of people killed themselves. Some still do) Anyway, it worked really well for nerve pain thank goodness. (This disease does not respond to opioids)  But at first the side effects are rough but it gets better. If you take it as needed then the side effects are going to be strong each time. Also, I could quit it (I had surgery that worked) but I just started back on it - day 3 now- and noticed that the side effects are stronger now that I am older. It's very uncomfortable but for me, it's worth it for a couple of weeks. It did change my life for the better.",tinak
12,Gabapentin,Trigeminal Neuralgia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 29, 2018",13,"It took me 7 years of Dr after Dr,  after an assault to get diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia. The original intense pain slowly subsided but the itching, inside my ear, up to my scalp, down my jaw and neck were unbearable. I often tore my skin to bleeding. I put it off to an allergic reaction as it was intermittent. Benadryl helped to knock me out at night and by day I tried to constrain myself from scratching. When I finally got a diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia and put on gabapentin, it was like an overnight miracle. Shortly I began to have breakthrough episodes of itching. I am now on 300 mg at bedtime after 6 months. I did experience this month sudden hair loss including a huge patch on the opposite side of my scalp, which I hope is not related to the gabapentin. It does list ""Hair disease"" as a potential side effect. My Derm is testing me for a host of potential causes.",NotMyRealName
13,Gabapentin,Trigeminal Neuralgia,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 31, 2018",19,I've had TN for several months now.  Ended up in the ER with the worst pain I have ever experienced.  I was crying and just wanted someone to cut my head off!  Was diagnosed with TN and sent to a neurologist.  He put me on low dose of Gabapentin which didn't work.  He keeps upping the dosage (6 - 9 pills a day) and I still get shocks next to my eye traveling down my cheek to my teeth and tongue.  It hurts to eat and talk.  I'm going to have him take me off of it and try something else.  Thinking about going to pain management.,DH
14,Gabapentin,Trigeminal Neuralgia,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 11, 2017",8,First prescribed gabapentin for trigeminal neuralia 25-30 yrs ago. It was great! Since then I have used it anytime Tylenol couldn't control any pain. Usually extreme stiff - sore muscles. I always worried I would build up a tolerance for it - consequently having to continually increase the dosage. To prevent this I never take it constantly and always get off it asap! Tremors are getting worse  & I have never tried it for this condition.  Just never occurred to me to try it. I will start tomorrow if it helps I'll not take a second dose until the tremors return. Treating as needed  - not constantly. Hoping to ward off the tolerance factor. If the tremors are just an occasional nuisance - I can live with that.,Raef

Searing hot pin pricks on the entire left side of my face.  ER doctor suggested TN or a sinus infection.  After a week, the symptoms all but disappeared.  After several weeks I started to get twinges of pain around my left upper lip area which progressed to include the whole left side of my face. Thinking this was all about my teeth I saw my dentist.  He took x-rays and did an examination and told me he thought I had TN.  My NP too suggested TN and will be referring me to a Neurologist.  In the meantime I am taking Neurontin 300mg 3x each day. The pain did not stop but has gradually lessened over the 1st week.  Looking forward to pain free days!",Downeast

That same day, my dentist called my GP. GP got me in right away. I was sent for facial x-rays to check for sinus infection, nothing. So my GP made several calls and got me into a neurologist, in the mean time, he asked her what he could give me for pain since at this point I had lost 10 lbs and was missing work. They put me on Gabapentin and Amitriptyline. It took a couple of days, but wow, when it started to work it was AMAZING for pain relief. They have upped me to 600mg 3 x a day and now at about three everyday I am a little high.

I am now taking 800 tid, and if the flare is bad, my neurologist says to take it 4 times a day. It is still helping control the pain, and I have been able to work and live normally. My dentist lets me cancel & reschedule if I'm having a flare. I even have some Emla cream to put carefully on the facial area that is most sensitive. There is also something called Warm Skin that a person can use in the winter, if you live in a cold region. That helps, too.

Every now and then I will get a little twitch or pinch from the trigeminal nerve, but nothing like the shooting pain I was having before. I take 300mg every night before bed.  Recently, there was a mix up with the prescription refill and my insurance, and due to these circumstances I went about a week without taking the medication.

I don't wait for the shooting pain, I now  take 300 mgs gabapentin at the slightest tingling of my scalp. It helps tremendously.
