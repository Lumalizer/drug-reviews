2,Propranolol,Thyrotoxicosis,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 9, 2019",13,"I have been on this drug propranolol for a while on and off and it helps me tremendously. My thyroid sends my heart rate up and also my anxiety levels, which leads to feel really rough and not coping with simple daily tasks. Propranolol has helped me many times in the last 18yrs and it continues. I can function normally without the horrendous palpitations. No side effects at all.",Tuxa
