1,Nexium,Barrett's Esophagus,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2020",26,"I've been suffering with Barrett's for years. Tried Omeprazole, anti-acid tablets etc. On Boxing Day last year I belched for 10 hours straight. There was a sulphur taste.I picked up a box of Nexium in a supermarket. Within a day I was a lot better. Only used five tablets in the pack. I've slept really well since then and only have a small amount of reflux. My quality of life has improved because of Nexium.",Bazza
2,Nexium,Barrett's Esophagus,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 18, 2019",17,"When I first started taking nexium for Barrett’s esophagus everything seemed fine. Then after having a gastric bleed, which they found cancer cells, I went through 6 weeks of radiation and chemo treatments. The good news is the cancers gone. But during that time the doctor doubled my dose of nexium to 80 mg. I take it as 40mg twice a day. So after 6 months of nexium treatment, I mysteriously had a spine fracture,  recurrent sinus infections, severe stomach pain  and inflammation. I couldn’t figure out what was happening, so I researched nexium and found it can weaken the bones and cause spine fractures, also contribute to stomach distress and sinus headaches and so many others things it’s hard to even imagine. Now I know why the FDA has put out so many warnings about this drug. My question is why don’t they ban it. I’m seeing my doctor about getting off this horrible drug",Hsp

6,Nexium,Barrett's Esophagus,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 24, 2018",25,"I’ve had  Barretts Esophagus for ten years & of all the meds prescribed, Nexium for Barretts Esophagus has been only one that saves me from horrible acid reflux.When insurance refused to pay any longer I attempted to treat my disease myself with many supplements for GERD.  I ended up with severely inflamed esophagus and a related stricture the Dr dilated at time of endoscopy.  He informed me I must return to  Nexium with no substitutes indefinitely as it is protecting me from getting cancer of the esophagus due to having Barretts.The inflammation healed right away once I was back on Nexium.",Carol

9,Nexium,Barrett's Esophagus,6.0,,"March 27, 2016",28,"Used Nexium for over 14 years. You need to stop taking this medication or any acid reducer medication 3 days before use of any antibiotics. IF you do not then you can get a infection that is quit dangerous called Clostridia Difficile or C. Diff which gives you diarrhea and paralyzed colon! The bacteria eats away at the lining of the Large Intestine until you bleed out, have diarrhea, and colon cancer and/or polyps! Use only for 3 days and stay off until you start having symptoms again; then use it again for 3 days, (72 hours) as that is how long your colon needs to regenerate! STOP! Then repeat! If you have trouble sleeping use Benadryl intermittently!",Klepanga

I don't really watch my diet like I should but I've had no issues at all, never any throat burn like I had prior to Nexium.
