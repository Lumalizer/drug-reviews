1,Rabeprazole,Barrett's Esophagus,10.0,,"February 6, 2022",0,Rabeprazole B683 tan/yellow pill works great. I have used for many years for Gerd. I get my medication from Walmart and they switched to a green pill. The Rabeprazole green pill 07 does not work very well at all for me and I started gaining weight. After persistent Walmart Agreed to fill my prescription for Rabeprazole and my Gerd went away and I have started losing weight again. Rabeprazole B 683 is distributed by Advagen Pharma Limited 666 Plainsboro Road Suite 605 Plainsboro NJ 08536 USA,RabeprazoleB683
2,Rabeprazole,Barrett's Esophagus,10.0,,"November 2, 2019",29,"Aciphex (rabeprazole):I was diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus and GERD @ 19 years ago.  My doctor put me on Aciphex and it work great.  My next scope Barrett's was healed but I was still taking Aciphex for GERD until insurance would no longer pay for it.  I could not afford the atrocious cost if Aciphex and switched.  I have tried all OTC, prescription Prilosec, and Prevacid.  None have worked as well as Aciphex.  I also have epilepsy and have to be mindful of drug interactions even with PPI's.   It's really sad that pharmaceutical and insurance companies dictate to consumers what they can and can't take based on monetary greed.  Who knows better than the consumer what is best, and works best, in treating their physical health & well being.",R.O.Y.
3,Rabeprazole,Barrett's Esophagus,,,"July 5, 2017",21,"Aciphex (rabeprazole):Have Taken ACIPHEX for 20 years until insurance companies refused to cover this and all PPI drugs. I have suffered ever since. Achipex 3 years ago cost $20.00 per 30 Tablets, Then in 2015,16 this medication increased to $378.00 per 30 tablets. Now my insurance company will not cover this drug. I am on my own. No PPI prescription drugs anymore. So, for every action there is a opposite and equal reaction. Scopes yearly. which will cost my insurance company more than a year of this drug. Idiots. Nothing works except ACIPHEX 20 MGs",Navajo Apache Joe

Note that this medicine does promote food moving through one's ""system"" more quickly so frequent bowel movements and loose stool may be an issue for some.",Anonymous
