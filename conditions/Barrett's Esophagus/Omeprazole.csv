0,Omeprazole,Barrett's Esophagus,8.0,,"March 5, 2021",18,I was taking Pantoprazole and having serious side effects. Omeprazole is so much better so far. I have to take 20mg. 2 times daily or I get a bad headache. I have Barrett's Esophagus and its pretty bad. I have to watch what I eat or I get serious upper middle chest pain .I always have trouble with medication. Sending prayers to everyone who has this. It is not fun at all.,DD
1,Omeprazole,Barrett's Esophagus,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 10, 2021",8,I keep trying it because the dr says I need it but since I’ve taken it it’s just made me feel like complete garbage. I didn’t even know I had reflux until I had the endo done. Well I had Barrett’s even worse then regular GERD but none the less. Ever since taking it I have had dizziness been overly anxious brain fog and some muscle pain and just exhausted. I had an undiagnosed autoimmune disease so I was chalking it up to that but I don’t think that’s the case at all. As soon as I started taking this is when I noticed. The only good thing it may have done is lowered my %EOS but I can’t even say for sure If this is why? I don’t know but this sure has me just stuck with what to do. I would recommend trying something different if you can and not taking this. Not to mention the long term side effects yuck! Scary stuff!,Ddmarie
2,Omeprazole,Barrett's Esophagus,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 11, 2020",38,"So I was prescribed this medication by my GI Dr after having an endoscopy and colonoscopy in July he said I have Barrett’s Esophagus. I have never really realized I had heart burn very often and if I did I would just take a few tums I started on this omeprazole in August. Since that time I have started having side effects of stiff joints, brain fog, dizziness, extreme anxiety and heart palpitations. I ended up in the ER a few weeks ago because I honestly thought I was having a heart attack. My potassium was high, which has never been an issue before and after researching to try to figure out what was going on I came across these reviews and boy let me tell you sounded just like me! This stuff is just awful! I don’t know what to do because I know I’m suppose to be on it but everything you research as an alternative med for this seem to have the same effects! Needless to say my GI dr thinks I’m crazy because he’s never heard of these symptoms happening! Think it might be time to find a new Dr!",Ddmarie

5,Omeprazole,Barrett's Esophagus,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 28, 2019",33,"I was taking omeprazole for GERD and after 6 months of taking it , a primary doctor said to stop taking this for awhile because of the long term side effects .  Of course I did and only had occasional heartburn. But unknown to me at the time, I had developed Barrett’s esophagus and started having problems with acid reflux again . After an EDG, they diagnosed me with Barrett’s and to go back on esomeprazole  40mg.  But I didn’t stay on it  for long because I was thinking about the long term side effects .  Wished I would of, really wished I would of stayed on omeprazole because now after a gastric ulcer, the surgeon discovered esophageal cancer. So  after cancer treatments of radiation and chemo, I am currently taking 40mg of this again, twice daily . I truly wish I would of stayed on it, thus possibly avoiding esophageal cancer",Jim

7,Omeprazole,Barrett's Esophagus,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 24, 2018",24,I have suffered with GERD (acid reflux) for over 20 years and was prescribed Omeprazole 20 mg twice a day. It has been very effective and I am able to eat anything although every once in awhile I get a terrible pain and have thought at times it is a heart attack. I recently found out I have Barrett’s Esophagus and have to be on this medication for the rest of my life. No issue as it works to take care of the issues in my digestive track.,Bernie
8,Omeprazole,Barrett's Esophagus,,,"August 5, 2017",4,"Started with Losec, which proved to be immediately effective, then was switched to omeprasol with no decrease in efficacy.",Battle
9,Omeprazole,Barrett's Esophagus,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 26, 2017",41,I have had GERD and Barrett's esophagus for many years and have been taking 20mg of omeprazole every day in the morning since the drug was approved by the FDA (early 1990's?). It has changed my life by eliminating the constant pain of severe heartburn with little to no side effects (I guess I'm lucky in that respect). My ENT doc says I will need to be on this drug for the rest of my life to ward off the potential of the Barrett's turning into esophageal cancer. Not to mention the comfort I am getting and the food choices I can make that no longer bother me and trigger heartburn.,Flumpet

14,Omeprazole,Barrett's Esophagus,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 10, 2016",91,"I have a US ARMY service connected disability including GERD and BARRETT'S. The VA has subscribed OMEPRAZOLE or equivalent for the past 30 years (at least) The RX calls for 3 caps daily. However I only take 2, AM & PM. I can eat anything I want with no side effects. I have never in all these years ever been told about a time limit, 7 days. 14 days or any days\ ! !I can only say that I can not be without these capsules, PERIOD. I guess the time limits must vary with each patient as I have NEVER had a problem.... I am now 86 years OLD !",Bobby HW
15,Omeprazole,Barrett's Esophagus,10.0,,"October 14, 2015",46,"I wish I could've been on this much earlier.  I first started getting acid reflux with my first pregnancy and it continued for over 20 years.  I never knew how dangerous it is...even though there'd be nights I wake up choking, coughing and feeling like someone poured acid down.  Two years ago, I started choking on poultry and larger pills.  After months of scares, finally saw a doctor.  After a few tests & endoscopy, my esophagus was actually closing up. The doctor had to widen it...the reflux had caused so much scarring, he said he could only open it up 2/3 of what it should be.  I always thought acid reflux was just an inconvience---never knew it could cause so much damage and potentially could have killed me.  Omeprazole really helped.",SoDo44
