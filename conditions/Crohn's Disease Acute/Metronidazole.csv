0,Metronidazole,Crohn's Disease Acute,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 17, 2019",4,"This medication metronidazole has definitely helped with my diarrohea from Crohns but the side effects are just awful. I'm been feeling so sick, so weak and my stomach has continuously felt uneasy. I've surprisingly been starving the whole time I'm on them even though I feel sick. No matter how much I eat I cannot stop being hungry.",555JJ
1,Metronidazole,Crohn's Disease Acute,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 30, 2017",4,"Metro (metronidazole):I'm a 40 year old male just recently diagnosed with Crohn's Disease. I had an MRI done and the doctor found an abscess on my bladder due to Crohn's. He put me on metronidazole (Flagyl) and ciprofloxacin (Cipro) for 30 days. The side effects for me are mild but weird. The Cipro gives me very vivid and intense dreams when I sleep. The metronidazole has many more effects: metallic taste in my mouth, altered sense of smell and taste, diarrhea/soft stool, lower energy levels and no sex drive. However, the side effects of the antibiotics are much milder than the effects of the abscess. It's not a fun combination but it's working well for me!",DefectiveGut
2,Metronidazole,Crohn's Disease Acute,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 9, 2016",5,"Taking for possible c diff complicated by Crohn's disease.For me the key to tolerating this drug isProbiotics taken in morning at least one hour before first flagyl dose and secondly,  drink at least 8 oz of water with each dose.  The addition of probiotics has made a huge difference  in side affects particularly  nausea.   Water also important. I still feel some fatigue and occasional headache, but tolerable.",Kknla
3,Metronidazole,Crohn's Disease Acute,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 8, 2016",7,"I really can't believe some of the posters on here. You are not supposed to taste it. Dear me it says swallow whole and some on here are sucking it like a werthers original. Under no circumstances should you drink and yet "" I couldn't resist a glass of red wine"" Unbelievable Jeff.Personally after two days of not sucking it like a smartie and not taking whilst on a stag doo, I find this medication very good. Beam me up Scotty",Motty
4,Metronidazole,Crohn's Disease Acute,9,,"November 27, 2015",4,"Periodically on Flagyl bc of crohns and rarely drink,  however I was on it during holidays a couple years ago and toasted the celebration with a half glass of champagne. 3 hours later I was burning up & felt like my chest was abt to explode.  1hour after that the vomiting began. I puked my guts up for 15 hours,  had to go to ER for dehydration and was miserable for another day.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ALCOHOL,  EVEN IN TINY AMOUNTS WHILE ON THIS DRUG. IT'LL RUIN YOUR NEXT DAY OR TWO.",Savprncss
5,Metronidazole,Crohn's Disease Acute,10,,"October 11, 2015",7,"This medicine has saved me from surgery twice now.  The first time was when I was first diagnosed with Crohn's Ileitis and had an abscess in my abdomen from a crack in my intestines and also several fistulas.  One doctor wanted to remove them surgically, another said lets try metronidazole.  So I was given IV metro for a couple days and then 1000 mg/day for a week or two (can't recall exactly how long it was), and the infection completely disappeared.  I was also given Humira, but that certainly didn't help with the infection.  The second time is actually right now.  My GI doc said I need surgery to remove my appendix and resect my ileum.  My bloodwork was showing infection, but I was put on 1000 mg/day of metronidazole and now its gone.",Mod/Severe Chrohn's Ileitis
6,Metronidazole,Crohn's Disease Acute,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 27, 2015",5,"Be extremely cautious when taking this medication. It was way to strong for me. I was prescribed this Medication, because I had developed a situation that the antibiotics I was taking were making me sick, so I was given Metronidazole, which made matters worse for me. I was experiencing Antibiotic Overload. Not a pleasant experience at all. Good luck if you have to take this med.",1sxcfreak2
7,Metronidazole,Crohn's Disease Acute,9,,"February 22, 2011",16,"Flagyl (metronidazole):Been taking this medicine in pill form since I left the hospital for 9 days now, 3 times a day.  I recommend eating with it. I feel incredibly listless and tired from it. However, at night, I don't actually sleep really well.  I also have major constipation.  Not sure if this is the culprit as I am taking a couple of other medications as well.  I think it is a side effect.  You've been forewarned.",Anonymous
