0,Prednisone,Crohn's Disease Acute,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 31, 2019",6,"Hi,I’m currently having a bad flare of Crohn's and my doc prescribed Prednisone. At first I thought it was working really well but then my situation just started degrading. I’m currently at 60mg and haven’t felt worst in my life. Could Prednisone worsen my symptoms? Next step is to get it injected but I’m not sure I want to do that now... I would try to get off it since its not doing anything for me...",Steph
1,Prednisone,Crohn's Disease Acute,5,,"July 9, 2018",7,"I have been recently diagnosed to have crohn's disease, I was advised to start Humira injections but I was too scared. So I decided to go for Prednisolone. I began with 40 mg per day. Symptoms of crohn's soon improved but the side effects of prednisone itself were really really nasty. I have lightheadedness, spinning in my head, weakness of muscles, unable to walk normally, blurred vision, dryness of eyes and mouth, shaking hands, insomnia, increase appetite, skin rash, panic like attacks.I eventually got Humira and now tapering down the prednisolone.  ( I've been on prednisolone for more than a month)",Sara
