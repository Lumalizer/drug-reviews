0,Levetiracetam,New Daily Persistent Headache,10,,"March 22, 2013",8,Great medicine for daily migraines.  Works really well with Zanaflex.,Letharn
1,Levetiracetam,New Daily Persistent Headache,2,,"October 20, 2011",32,"Keppra (levetiracetam):Keppra made me very sleepy, and my hair came out in chunks- worse even than the hair loss from Topamax and Verapamil. I was also very angry and had no patience with my family. All these side effects, with very minimal help- my headaches began later in the day than normal. I went off of it and am now waiting on my insurance to approve Botox since I have tried all the others with no help except Topamax- which also made me too hostile and lose chunks of hair.",Anonymous
2,Levetiracetam,New Daily Persistent Headache,10,,"July 10, 2011",34,"Keppra (levetiracetam):I have had chronic migraines for 16 years.  Because of my hyper-sensitivity to many medications (antidepressants, Topamax, Depakote, and the list keeps going), I had a great deal of trouble finding a preventative medicine that my body could tolerate at a therapeutic dose. Keppra keeps my migraines to a minimum (about 8 per year, which is so much better than the every-other-day I was experiencing).  I do have some fatigue and depression as side effects, but they are worth the trade off.",Anonymous
3,Levetiracetam,New Daily Persistent Headache,10,,"February 5, 2010",28,"Keppra (levetiracetam):I've been using 1500 mg of Keppra for about three years now for a very achy head.  Through an MRI, my Dr. found that I have Cerebellar Atrophy.  As long as I take my 750mg dose at the same time each a.m., I  have absolutely no problems anymore with my achy head that I've lived with all of my life, (til the age of 48). If I wake up late, it's not worth it at all.  I'll wake up with an awful headache, that doesn't go away until about 1/2 an hour after I take the Keppra.  I also take 750mg just before bed.  My achy head is in the past now, thanks to Keppra.",myeckie
