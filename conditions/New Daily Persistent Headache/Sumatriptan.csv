0,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,10,,"November 16, 2019",4,"I suffer with very bad anxiety and stress so as a result of this I get regular tension headaches. Normal painkillers, paracetomol, ibuprofen etc don't work so I visited my GP who prescribed sumatriptan and from day one of using these the headaches went within one hour. In my experience, they are the best medication for headaches.I'm lucky I don't have any side effects as some of my friends do.",Kazz
1,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,1,,"January 10, 2017",5,"I've been having chronic headaches for the past month to the point where they get severe (not a migraine) so I asked my dr for Sumatripan and she gave me it, little did I know it doesn't get rid of the headache nor relieve it, I'm on day 2 of it and all it's done is make me dizzy, my chest feel heavy and horrible that I can't breathe and need to cough hard, my shoulders feel heavy and achein my neck, and it's made my headache feel like a full blown migraine which I haven't felt for 4 years, never having it again I don't recommend this medication it's made me feel really horrible",Jay2017
2,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,10,,"September 1, 2016",6,"I love this medicine. I suffer from eye pain then a knot in my back muscle then vision aura and light flashes then here it comes the vice feeling in my right side of my head. That knaws at me all day unless I take sumatriptan within 15 minutes I'm a new person The only down fall is my doctor won't let me take more than 9 a 2 week period. So I suffer in between nothing else works this medicine is s miracle worker",Theresa G
3,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,9,,"May 7, 2015",9,"I've suffered with tension headache and migraine for years and nothing has ever really helped with the pain, until now. As soon as I feel one coming one I take one tablet and the pain is gone with 20/30 minutes. The only downside to using this medicine is the side effects I have. Hot flushes and a heavy burning sensation in my legs almost like growing pains. But I much rather the side effects than the headache.",Morgan1990
4,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 5, 2014",8,"Haven't seen many people with my experience so I appreciate Housewifeandmothers input below. Maybe my problem is also with generic sumatriptan. Maybe my dose at 100mg is too high? But 3 out of 4 times after taking it I became horribly nauseous and vomited the pill up within 10 minutes of taking it. I'm afraid to ever go near it again! Still looking for relief from my daily crippling headaches. Vicodin and Hydrocodone seem to be the only thing to relieve my pain. Started taking magnesium supplements as well, but no improvement yet. But FYI, I think my experience is uncommon.",TAnne

6,Sumatriptan,New Daily Persistent Headache,9,,"September 24, 2009",12,"Imitrex (sumatriptan):I love this medicine! I was on 50mg tablets, then I was switched to 6mg shots. Sure, side effects are still there, but they are less vicious, and after 2 hours, I am fine for an afternoon. NDPH is a little different.",elcollins95
