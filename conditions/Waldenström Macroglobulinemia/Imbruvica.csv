0,Imbruvica,Waldenström Macroglobulinemia,1,,"October 12, 2020",4,"My husband has Non Hodgkins Lymphoma and Waldenstrom Macroglobulemia, he had been treated with Chemotherapy in the past. He was leading a very normal and active life then last year in June 2019 he needed to be started on Ibrutinib, after the fifth month of treatment on the 30th of November 2019 he suffered a cardiac arrest at home.  It was the most terrifying thing I have ever witnessed, I had to perform CPR till the ambulance arrived!  He was in hospital for six months, he is home now and I am his carer as he suffered a Hypoxic brain injury as a definite result of Ibrutinib!  The consultants in ICU said it was a direct result of being on ibrutinib, it is also written on my husband's discharge letter from hospital.  I totally blame ibrutinib and now our lives will never be the same.",Log
1,Imbruvica,Waldenström Macroglobulinemia,8,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 26, 2019",13,"Initially, Imbruvica caused rather severe fatigue in first two months after which it gradually improved. Most noticeable side effect is frequent diarrhea. I take 1 Imodium cap almost every day and 2 after very loose stool. Also considerably raised blood pressure. Added 2 meds for this. I’m about 18 months after diagnosis and basic blood work shows white, red, and platelet count normal, but Igm protein level still elevated, but steadily decreasing. Usually feeling good, but still have unpredictable, but short episodes of fatigue requiring several hours of rest. Manufacturer provides a $30 supplement, a pittance considering monthly cost of $11,000.",Fhertel1
