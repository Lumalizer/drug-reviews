I was pretty moody, crazy, aggressive - not my normal self... it was a long 9 months. I can't understate how mood altering this medicine was - not in a good way. I was embarrassed to talk about it, which made my behavior all the more odd to my friends and co-workers, but once I explained it, I got some support - anyhow, I wish I had done that from the start. On the plus side, I'm still here!",Still Here
