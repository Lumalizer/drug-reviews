0,Flagyl,Peritonitis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2018",4,I am one of these people who has bad gums (no matter how much time I spend on my dental care).  Over the last ten years I have had four tooth infections so severe I was almost hospitalised with one of them.  I have a high tolerance for pain and I can honestly tell you that giving birth was nothing compared to my tooth infections (and I have had three children).  My dentist prescribed Flagyl which has been the only medication that works for these severe tooth infections. I always keep some in my medicine cabinet for an emergency. I think we need to be open-minded about side effects as our bodies are different and what works for one will not work for another.  I have never suffered any of the side effects that can come with taking this medication.,Annie
