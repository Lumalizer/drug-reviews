2,Metronidazole,Peritonitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 21, 2020",2,Metronidazole is a great antibiotic. Had a dental abscess and a day later the swelling was gone! Despite the negative reviews its a good antibiotic but its strong - so drink loads of water.,Ls
3,Metronidazole,Peritonitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 8, 2020",1,"I had been subscribed metazol 400 for a gum infection, 3 times a day for 5 days. All I can say is that I have never taken an antibiotic that made me feel so terrible. Loss of appetite, stomach cramps, nausea, slight diarrhea, bloating, upset stomach overall. BEWARE! Find an alternative!",Emma
4,Metronidazole,Peritonitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 19, 2019",2,"These metronidazole tablets have helped with my infection as had a wisdom tooth infection however, I’ve had the following side effects- Upset stomach (wind, gas)  - got better with having probiotics. Mental health- I’ve felt very angry, irritable, and really dark thoughts, I’ve never felt so low taking these before, personally I would not recommend taking these unless these are your last option if you have mental health issues diagnosed  like myself as it proper sets it off badly.",OhRealReview1
5,Metronidazole,Peritonitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 6, 2019",2,"I was honestly scared reading the reviews on here to start this medication but thankfully no extreme side effects for me. I was taking metronidazole with penicillin for my gum issues. The only side effects I noticed was  a slight elevated heart rate about an hour after taking the first couple of days which went away after about 30 minutes. I got the discoloured urine side effect and on day 4/5 some loose stool as I have a bowel condition with chronic constipation it is hard for me to judge that issue specifically. I didn't get any cramps or sickness with the loose stool.The slight side effects I felt could have been from the penicillin, Metronidazole, painkillers I was taking for my tooth or combination of all of them together.I wanted to add my review for those who like me were scared after reading all the other reviews and thought the worst might happen after taking a tablet.",El1983
6,Metronidazole,Peritonitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 26, 2019",0,"Some years back I was prescribed flagyl in advance of an appendectomy. It caused such severe vomiting that I was sent to the ER, at which point I was so dehydrated that they could barely find a vein for the IV.  The pre-surgical flagyl side effects were way worse than the post-surgical incision pain.",Lisa
7,Metronidazole,Peritonitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2018",4,Flagyl (metronidazole):I am one of these people who has bad gums (no matter how much time I spend on my dental care).  Over the last ten years I have had four tooth infections so severe I was almost hospitalised with one of them.  I have a high tolerance for pain and I can honestly tell you that giving birth was nothing compared to my tooth infections (and I have had three children).  My dentist prescribed Flagyl which has been the only medication that works for these severe tooth infections. I always keep some in my medicine cabinet for an emergency. I think we need to be open-minded about side effects as our bodies are different and what works for one will not work for another.  I have never suffered any of the side effects that can come with taking this medication.,Annie
