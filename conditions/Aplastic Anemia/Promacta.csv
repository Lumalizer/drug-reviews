0,Promacta,Aplastic Anemia,10,,"May 8, 2019",4,"Promacta and Eltrombopag are the same drug. One name is the scientific name Eltrombopag and the retail (brand) name is Promacta. There is no difference in the two names they are the same medicine.Our son did very well with ATG Horse, Cyclosporine and Promacta (Eltrombopag). Four years in he has not received a bone marrow transplant and has only received three blood transfusions ever. He lives a pretty normal life but does monitor his labs often and is still on meds. He did have a slow relapse and we found that him going back on high dose cyclosporine twice a day and taking the Promacta (Eltrombopag) helped his labs go back up again (near normal) again avoiding a BMT. If insurance doesn't pay for it have your doctor advocate first and if still no, call Novartis or visit their website as they have options to send this very expensive medicine to you for free.",AplasticAnemiaMom
1,Promacta,Aplastic Anemia,2,,"December 27, 2017",3,"I have been taking Promacta for two months for Aplastic Anemia and have seen no increase in my hemoglobin count. I have had no significant side effects, but do not think the drug is  effective in my case, too bad it's probably chemo for me.The drug is easy to take if you can find the proper time. I take it around 4 am when I first wake up then try to get some more sleep. Hope it works for you.",no nickname
