0,Rabeprazole,GERD,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 14, 2021",8,"I am an 80 year old male. I was prescribed Rabeprazole 20 mg for GERD and stomach ulcers 15 years back and it worked very well. Since then I have been using it on an as-needed basis. Initially I would wait for serious symptoms such as acute gastritic pain, choking or vomiting to develop before taking Rabeprazole which would cure the condition very quickly. Over the years I realized that my hyper acidity is a chronic condition and that it is better to take the medication preventively rather than suffer the nasty pain regularly. After a lot of experimentation I now take one Rabeprazole 20 mg every 4 days and it is sufficient to keep GERD at bay. I have never had any side effects from this medicine.",Ram
1,Rabeprazole,GERD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 23, 2021",5,"Aciphex (rabeprazole):Hoping my review might help someone. I have gastritis and went through about 4 different PPIs before I took this one because the others caused severe anxiety. Aciphex was the first med that helped and didn't cause a huge increase in anxiety. With this med in the morning and taking Remeron at night, I am now feeling much better. I also adjusted my diet significantly as well.",Kgdeases
2,Rabeprazole,GERD,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 14, 2020",14,Aciphex (rabeprazole):I have been taking brand name Aciphex since probably late 1990s. 20 mg/day magically disappeared my symptoms after all other PPIs and H2 blockers eventually failed.  Then the price started to go up so I celebrated the day the patent expired.  Generic rabeprazole was a great disappointment so we (my GI doc and I) kept writing letters to insurance so they would pay for the brand name.  Eventually the price went out of control so we had to abandon that option.  We found out that Eisai ltd. the manufacturer of Aciphex also manufactured the generic rabeprazole under the name of Pariet in Great Britain.  This worked so far for the last couple of years but I have to double the dose to 40 mg/day and combine it with 20 mg of famotidine.  I read other reviews that indicate people had similar frustrating experiences when switching to generic rabeprazole.  I wonder what makes that difference and why?,Peojo
3,Rabeprazole,GERD,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 1, 2020",3,"I tried multiple OTC drugs for GERD, including Prevacid, which gave me horrible diarrhea.  I went to the GI doctor who prescribed me AcipHex and said that it was less likely to cause GI issues and would take away the GERD and belching from my hiatal hernia.  It solved the GERD but not the belching but I had HORRIBLE rashes pop up and I couldn't figure out why I was so itchy.  Then, I realized this was the only new thing I added recently.  Side effects are rashes, itching, SLE, and others.  I was having an allergic reaction.  I had rashes all over my back!  I had to take Benadryl.  I have stopped the AcipHex and will be calling the doctor on Monday.  :(",MissLeopard83

Now taking the generic, rabeprazole.  I had to go through all the over the counter meds as well. Rabeprazole gave me some relief but not for long.  Heaven forbid I miss one dose.  It never relieves the symptoms fully.  I would take Aciphex maybe 5-6 times a month will full relief.  It's like a wonder drug.
