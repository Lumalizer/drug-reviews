0,Protonix,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 11, 2021",3,"I started taking protonix a few months ago. I’m 19 and have never had any prior health issues besides bad acid reflux. I was taking protonix for about a week and started to notice awful headaches. By week two I was having awful dizzy spells and I avoided going to class because I thought I was going to pass out. I thought all of these side effects was related to when I had COVID a month prior so I overlooked it. After taking this medicine for a month I went to the ER twice because I felt like my heart was skipping beats, I was nauseous, couldn’t catch my breath, tingling in my hands and feet, and my dizzy spells were unbearable. The doctors summed it up to panic attacks which I knew was wrong because I’m not an anxious person. I researched protonix online and realized a lot of other people had the same side effects. DO NOT take this medicine!!! It made me feel like I was going crazy and for a whole month I couldn’t do anything because of dizzy spells!",Hll
1,Protonix,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2021",3,"Prescribed Protonix by my dr and after a week and a half I had to stop. Almost immediately, anything I ate gave me heartburn  (I didn't have frequent heartburn before), headaches every morning, extreme nausea so much that I had no appetite, foggy brain, joint pain in my hands/wrists, abdomen pain, and depression/anxiety. I wish I would have done my research and asked more questions. I'm on day 2 after stopping and I feel slightly better. I'm going to try a cleaned up diet and not eating so late. Let us hope it works.",Renee
2,Protonix,GERD,10.0,,"February 1, 2021",14,I have had GERD for over 10 years now and I tried nexium otc helped but I ended up in the hospital because I had chest pain really bad. The hospital put me on cafarate and protonix it helped right away I take protonix twice a day and cafarate before every meal and at bedtime. I can eat anything I want and have no more pain in my chest. I will continue to take this medication as long as I can because I can eat anything without any pain,Diana Leberge
3,Protonix,GERD,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2021",28,My stomach really started hurting on Dec 23rd. I’ve battled reflux many times over the years. I’m 57 but not like this. I started on Pantoprazole on Monday this morning my stomach is starting to feel bit normal. I hope so as I’ve had this gnawing nausea although has gotten slightly better at times since 23rd. even few occasions like I never had it but didn’t last long. I have slight other symptoms as you all know heartburn indigestion slight feeling through but it’s the stomach that worries me anyone have any thoughts about stomach nausea I’d love to hear. And does it take the meds time to fully kick in. Thank u to everyone nothing short of GODS blessings always.,Bob
4,Protonix,GERD,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 20, 2020",19,"My GERD mainly affected my voice and was the source of mild chest pain. I started Protonix about a week ago and it's been a massive help already. I feel like I can finally breathe again. I've tried OTC drugs in the past such as omeprazole and Gaviscon, but neither helped. I'm virtually symptom-free now and have experienced no side effects.",Boopie
5,Protonix,GERD,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 4, 2020",123,"I have GERD. I couldn't eat anything. I was give protonix by the ER. Pain stopped I changed my diet drastically and slowly weaned myself from Protonix. Prior to this I tried Zantac, Nexium and Prilosec however I choose not to take these meds anymore and stick to my diet of low fat, low carb, no salt, no sugar and no fast, frozen or processed foods and I have lost weight and feel great with no pain. I also avoid smoke. when I was first prescribed these medication I didn't like any of them.  I don't feel it's a good idea to inhibit the bodies natural processes so I make better food choices",Hotshot
6,Protonix,GERD,1.0,,"July 21, 2020",154,"I started taking protonix 40mg once daily after they took Zantac off the market. I started having a lot of stomach pain, gas, bloating, and watery diarrhea. It took me a while to figure out it was the protonix. I stopped taking it and replaced it with Pepcid complete once a day. Almost immediately those symptoms went away. I would be very careful taking this drug.",Pj
7,Protonix,GERD,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 17, 2020",46,"I took this for about 2 and a half months. Half way through I told my Dr it wasn't working. He said I was under stress. Not. Then I developed a hot, itchy rash on my arms and face. They told me to stop taking it and start Nexium. I didn't because to me they seem to have the same risk. Being off Protonix is almost as bad as being on it. Terrible acid reflux. I am sleeping sitting up, I can't eat very much, I can hardly wake up and start falling asleep around 7 PM and I have had a headache off and on for 3 days. Going to an Internal Medicine Specialist next because I’d like to know the reason for the reflux I have had for 1.5 years not just take a medication.",MsS
8,Protonix,GERD,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 24, 2019",42,I started on Zantac and it just stopped working for me. I've been taking this pill for years and it does wonders! I have 0 noticable side effects. Its important to take it both every day and before you eat or it is not as effective.,Steph
9,Protonix,GERD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 16, 2019",102,"I have had acid reflux disease for four years. I tried prilosec. I lost thirty pounds to try to help my reflux, I changed my diet, and I took an extreme amount of rolaids. Nothing worked and I was miserable. Finally got my GP to listen and put me on this stuff after a family member recommendation. It is wonderful. It is like I never had reflux to begin with. It helped me get my life back. My only concern is the side-effects for long term use seem scary. But if I don't treat the reflux, I will end up with barrett's esophagus, which puts me between a rock and a hard place.",Noodle

If I don't take it I have constant, severe heartburn (I have a hiatal hernia, gastritis, and GERD that resulted from an h.pylori infection that went undetected for what I assume is several years). When I do take it, I can eat literally anything and not get heartburn.",Beanie

13,Protonix,GERD,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 30, 2018",33,"I have had GERD as long as I can remember. It wasn't quite so bad before pregnancy that I decided against medication. Since becoming pregnant, it was to the point of throwing up stomach acid a few times a day & I could barely move. We tried a few other medications that just did not work. I have been on protonix for 1 month & I have not had a single bit of heartburn since the very first day I took it.",Rhi
14,Protonix,GERD,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 30, 2018",47,"Since my early twenties (I am mid 50s now) I have had great difficulty swallowing with a feeling that something was stuck in my throat, followed by esophageal spasms, followed by projectile vomiting of stomach acid. Episodes could last for up to 10 hours. I've been hospitalized several times while have sever episodes of uncontrollable spasms/vomiting for hours.I was misdiagnosed for decades, had my throat stretched by laparoscopy/balloons periodically and tried a variety of medications. Nothing helped. I was extremely underweight from not being able to eat for so many years. Finally, a doctor put me on Protonix and it was a miracle. Unbelievably life changing. My only complaint was I gained 20 lbs in the first year I was on it. I take it twice a day and can eat whatever I like with no reaction.",Jett
15,Protonix,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 28, 2018",25,"I took Protonix for about a week and every time I took it, I got a severe headache every day. It did help to keep my heartburn at bay but to me, it is not worth it for the side effects. My mood dropped because of this medicine and I just did not feel like myself. I have stopped taking this medicine and I am now taking Zantac 150mg. Took effect and it is working wonders for me.",Anonymous
16,Protonix,GERD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 1, 2018",46,"I would wake up coughing up fluids and constantly have acid reflux symptoms, which began to lead to swallowing issues and high anxiety. My doctor put me on pantoprazol (protonix) and I take it once every morning. 40mg. I am not someone who likes medicine and won't even take tylenol for a headache.

20,Protonix,GERD,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 20, 2017",41,"I have had GERD for years now. I started out taking Prilosec, but it started making me burp a lot and it would just absolutely hurt. My doctor switched me to Protonix and that has helped so much. I take 40 mgs twice a day. I don't burp nearly as much and food doesn't creep back up and into my mouth like it did so much either. I also take Zantac at night, but it still had helped a lot even before then. It's been such a relief. I didn't get any side effects from it either. I take it 30 minutes before breakfast and 30 minutes before lunch.",Gastroparesis Girl
21,Protonix,GERD,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 6, 2016",37,"I have had severe Gerd/Acid Reflux for nearly 6 years. It has put me in the hospital 7 times now and has totally destroyed my teeth which I have always been meticulous about caring for. Presently, it's also causing me swallowing problems and voice troubles. The pain the Gerd can generate is an actual true ""10""-Far far worse than the pain I experienced from a Quad Cardiac Bypass surgery. My doctor gave me Protonix for it and it worked Very well on reducing, perhaps, 80% of the pain. Unfortunately, the medication caused Peripheral Edema Big time and I had to go off of it again. The edema immediately went away, but the pain came back too. I have noticed this reaction from almost all proton pumps that I have tried to date.",Wagriff
22,Protonix,GERD,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 1, 2016",58,"I took this medication until my HMO dropped it fron their formulary. While taking it, I felt great. I took only one a day and, if I forgot to take it or forgot to refill it before running out, I could miss a day or two without the heartburn returning. My doctor subsequently put me on Prilosec, twice a day. If I miss one, heartburn returns with a vengeance. If I miss a whole day, it takes three to five days to get the heartburn under control, again",DublJ
23,Protonix,GERD,,,"February 22, 2016",80,"I had heartburn and a history of an ulcer so my doctor put me on Protonix and when taking it daily I feel great, however with the new information about this kind of drug being linked to dementia and also that is can cause one to be addicted to it and cause rebound acid I decided to stop it. I am on day 4 and now a mild constant burning is in my stomach and often back up to my chest. I was given them for heartburn but the doctor wrote gerd and later I developed gerd on days I tried not to take it so I am concerned about this all coming back by 10 times worse. I am looking into a natural alternative first as dementia is all around in my family and my new holistic/medical doctor says this type of drug is dangerous.",TerryTwoHearts
24,Protonix,GERD,1.0,,"December 17, 2015",79,"This was the worst medication I have ever taken. I was just prescribed this medication last week. After on it for only 2 days I stopped. Headache was unbearable. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital to get a cat scan until I realized it was probably the protonix. Then there was the nausea they came along as well. Five days later, I'm still nauseous, but used ginger to help with that. Overall, I will never use this medicine again.",Tee85
25,Protonix,GERD,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 14, 2015",90,"Unfortunately I have suffered with very serious GERD for 28 years and it has been awful. I have tried every prescription medicine out there and none of them work for me like Protonix does. I feel very close to a normal human being on this medication but none of the others lived up to Protonix. I received a horrible notice from our health insurance provider this past week and after December 31, 2015 they will no longer cover this drug. Their only suggestion for me with severe reflux is to try something else!!! I have tried EVERYTHING else on the market and nothing works but Protonix. NOTHING! I am so sick with the GERD when I am off this medicine I am pretty much house bound because I am so sick. For me it is a miracle drug!",bordercollielover
26,Protonix,GERD,1.0,,"September 24, 2015",42,"I was put on this medication after my insurance company stopped covering another PPI that worked well for me. I lasted one month and spent most of it popping ranitadine since anything I ate or drank caused almost immediate heartburn. By the end of the month I was vomiting. It was awful. I hated to be a pain but I called my PCP and told them I needed to go back on my previous med, which of course involved a lot of paperwork on his part. I have a friend that swears by this medication but mostly all I did was swear during the month I took it.",DonnaRNCEN

I never had stomach problems but got what they thought was an ulcer, later endoscopy showed no ulcer, but signs of Barrett's esophagus.  I also had hoarse voice, especially in the morning. Ph study pointed to GERD.  Long story short, no more hoarseness. Subsequent scopes show no signs of esophagus damage. Now for the bad. Very rarely, when I eat fast, I do get choking sensations that I did not ever have before. Also, if I run out of the medicine and/or miss a dose or two, wicked bad heartburn. Never had heartburn before. As long as I stay on it I am good. ",rv Rob

The Protonix worked wonders!  But then I noticed I was constipated and had a huge appetite.  I briefly switched medicines but went back to Protonix.  It was when I started taking it again and had two abdominal exams that I realized my liver was enlarged.  The doctors immediately dismissed it since I've had my gallbladder removed.  They said it was scar tissue.  My daughter has eosinophilic colitis so I'm really just focused on her gastrointestinal care, but at my next follow up I will address the issue.  I did cut out milk/dairy from my diet and that seemed to help as much as the medicine!",Bad gut
