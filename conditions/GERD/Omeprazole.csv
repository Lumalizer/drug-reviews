0,Omeprazole,GERD,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 28, 2022",4,"Evil drug!!! Do not take it took me over 4 months to get over the side effects and I still have little lapses to this day a year later. Not sure what they have done but like they put my whole nervous system on overdrive horrible drug. Honestly I'd rather the gastric acid do the max damage then ever go through that again. Dizziness, brain fog, eye twitches, muscle spasms randomly all over more slightly left shoulder and arm. Made me nervous about everything. I was horrible to people getting very aggressive over nothing, burning and itching of the skin, pins and needles in feet and hands, non stop congestion and ear ache, waking up during sleep feeling like I'd stop breathing.This probably around half of what I went through, the list is endless.",Mark
1,Omeprazole,GERD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 18, 2022",1,"I'm not sure what condition I have but my doctor thinks it has to do with stomach acids coming back up. I have problems with eating sometimes that feels like food is not going all the way to the stomach. Then I can't eat and start coughing and then vomit A LOT. I started this drug about a year ago. Was told to take it for one month 'every day' and see how it went. It worked perfectly with no side effects that I noticed but after about a week after I stopped it, it started again. So, I took it for another month the same way. The same thing happened. Then I started taking 1 capsule once a week and that worked fine for several months. Now I need to take one about every 4 days. Otherwise, it will come back. So, I'm staying on this schedule for a while and hope it keeps working.",Anonymous
2,Omeprazole,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 14, 2022",6,"I don’t even know where to start.  I will say this medicine did work but the side effects are absolutely horrible! The anxiety, depression, and impending doom I felt all day long was terrible! I was on 40mg a day for 14 days along with famotodine for an ulcer.  I just finished my 14 days and the symptoms (Anxiety and feel like something bad is going to happen) are still there. Can anyone please tell me if this anxiety will eventually go away and how long?

Headaches, drooling, coughing, choking and had no energy and rotten taste in mouth and throat burning up, so couldn't speak. I refuse to stay on tablets instead I am going to watch diet and lose weight. Any tests I had showed clear so it was tablets side effects making me worse. Natural products are best.",Liz
4,Omeprazole,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 14, 2022",7,"Do not take this or any other PPI! I’m dead serious when I say this, either Doctors bury their head in the sand or they know and just don’t care what this does to some people. How in the heck does a PPI that is supposed to control stomach acid affect your head and heart? I’ve had all of these same symptoms of everyone else on here. Headaches out of no where, uneasiness feeling when laying down, feeling like weight on my chest at night, when I’m about to fall asleep something in my body shocks and I gasp for air, just craziness. I tried PAN for 30 days and a week after it must have cause bad bacteria in my stomach because for 1.5 weeks I was bloated everyday and burped non stop… for the first time in my life. That happened on and off for 2 months but the Dr wanted me to try it again to get rid of chronic gastritis once and for all. 4 days in all the symptoms again but on Omeprazole this time… it was actually worse than I remember on PAN.",Aaron p

When I started taking them again the ocular migraines started again.  I tried this a couple of times and am certain that the omeprazole caused these ocular migraines.

7,Omeprazole,GERD,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 31, 2022",0,"Prilosec (omeprazole):I was recently prescribed Prilosec after a few years of digestive discomfort and multiple medical appointments to diagnose and treat. Previously I was prescribed Famotidine which provided some relief but Prilosec resolved all symptoms I was having- shortness of breath, abdominal discomfort, inability to lay on one side, and acid reflux. After one week I feel remarkably better and plan to taper treatment after a few months. I've had no side effects and understand that Prilosec isn't recommended for more than 12 months of use, as with most other prescription drugs including SSRI/antidepressants (which most people stay on for many years).",ASTXRR
8,Omeprazole,GERD,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 30, 2022",3,"So weird how a medicine simply meant to lower levels of stomach acid can cause side effects as devastating as 220mg Effexor withdrawal. I can continue to live my life by willpower, but the brain fog, brain zaps, forgetfulness, vertigo among others really makes it a drag. I only took it twice. I took it at 3pm, and the next morning when I woke up I thought I was getting sick. Then I googled omeprazole and felt eased. No anxiety increase, but it has really slowing my thinking. Garbage medicine. Three points because it actually worked well for my heartburn. Maybe I'd use omeprazole sparingly, but I can't see myself following a daily course for weeks in any universe. Thank God it doesn't conflict with any other medication I'm currently taking, because I'm really kicking myself for not looking it up before taking, or even purchasing. $40 down the drain. I'm depending on Aspirin to keep going for now, because without it, pounding heartbeat side effect really saps my energy.",Maggie
9,Omeprazole,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 18, 2022",3,"So I’m still going through tests to figure out if my acid reflux is caused by GERD or an ulcer. Nonetheless my doctor prescribed this for me in the meantime because I literally wasn’t eating, the pain was too great after eating. Day 3 I started feeling the headaches and I’m going to day 7 and I’m completely a nutcase. I’m already diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Also doesn’t help that I have PMDD as well. This did nothing but ramp it up to 100. It’s the nausea and shakes for me that really did it, and the headaches really topped the cake. The dizziness is almost constant. I loathe this/I don’t think it’s worth it. Please look into alternatives with your doctor and advocate for yourself because they WILL try and convince you that this is normal/that you’re being dramatic. You are not. Your feelings/pain are valid. You deserve better than this poison. (20mg 3x a day/7days)",Not worth it

People around me describe me as a little on the sensitive side, fun loving, humorous, kind hearted, helpful, hard working, and respectful. I have loved soccer for years. I'm pretty good at it. Coach says I'm one of the best he has ever coached. I am a very diligent worker, and that has given rise too many opportunities.  I was given an offer to help coach a children's team. I was over the moon! Then I began the treatment plan with included omeprazole.  I suddenly changed. I wasn't as devoted to my sport. I rarely practiced. I made a few decisions that will affect me the rest of my life. I'm 22 years old, living at home, and almost got kicked out by my parents because of my behavior.

A month later I slowly started getting better. It is now about a month since I stopped. My stomach is better, though still aches. I do not have much acid. I do have lots of wind passing. My doctor did endoscopy. Normal. He wants an MRI for pancreatic cancer.

Unfortunately, unlike the pantoprazole I did not inform my GP of the side effects until about a few days later, after I stop taking the omeprazole. As things got worst, I started experiencing more rebound effects from stopping omeprazole ""cold turkey"": the acid reflux was 10 X's worst, the anxiety attacks were more frequent, the bloating, constipation, and gas were unbearable, the excruciating stomach spasms went from once a week to every hour.

Omeprazole is the only medicine that I've been given that can even come close to alleviating my reflux and therefore my pain.  The problem though is that this medication makes me so sick I can hardly function.  It causes nausea, dizziness, brain fog, muscle fatigue, and eventually leads to a kind of painful swelling lump feeling at the base of my throat that can be highly distracting.  It's horrible but so is the chest pain from reflux.  So, when the pain gets unbearable I take the Omeprazole and stop when it makes me sick (usually around day 8 or 9), then I quit the medication until the chest pain again becomes unbearable.  It's a vicious, awful, horrible cycle between pain and illness.  If you can avoid this medication, do!",sumguy

Thankfully all tests came back ok and the doctor told me to stop the omeprazole.  No more blood! I also has increased anxiety and thought it was just nervousness because I was sick.

My condition started about 4 years ago when I would notice food getting stuck in my throat. This got worse after 2 years. It even got to the stage I couldn't even enjoy a packet of crisps without it sticking in my throat. 1 day it got very serious where I felt food was stuck in my throat and I had to throw up to remove it. I made an appointment and got sent to hospital. After getting a camera put up my nose to view my upper esophagus the 2 doctors said there was nothing there and just drink more water. Thanks NHS. I knew that wasn't the case. I nearly lost all hope until I made an emergency appointment at my local doctors surgery. From that day on they prescribed me Almus 20mg Omepazole. 5 months on and I can eat whatever I want in confidence. The worry of family dinners and eating out with my wife is now a thing of the past.
