0,Nexium,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 7, 2022",0,"I was diagnosed with Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) in 2018, in my mid-40s.  This surprised me because I had zero problems with reflux in my life, and in fact never experienced heartburn ever.The doctor advised I take Nexium for my LPR, as well as abruptly cut out caffeine.  The result was disastrous.  I abruptly developed a crippling anxiety, depression, and anhedonia (lack ability to feel pleasure) problem, about a week later.  I never had any of these conditions prior to taking Nexium and cutting out the caffeine!After about a few weeks, I tried quitting first the Nexium and then later bringing back the caffeine.  A few days after doing both, my psychological condition rapidly improved.  However, at the time I attributed my issues being from caffeine withdrawal, and not the Nexium.Wrong!  I ended up being given Nexium again for something different, and the anxiety started to return!  I quickly quit it, and went back to normal.If it makes you feel anxious, quit it now!",LPRguy
1,Nexium,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2022",1,"Was put on this medication for GERD, took it for 5 days. I do already battle anxiety and depression and since taking these meds my anxiety and depression has gone through the roof!!! Felt suicidal and am now booked into a Psych hospital. None of my doctors took me serious when I told them that that was the effects it had on me. Stopped taking it for 3 days and anxiety decreased. Was forced to take it again yesterday and I ended up not being able to sleep and woke up with anxiety again. I wish doctors would do more research on these meds and not just simply follow the leaflet on side effects.",Dee

I wanted to stop taking it a while ago as I felt it wasn’t working but the specialist insists on taking it. Since taking 40mg I have felt so nauseous, have headaches, and feel so dizzy. Since reading these reviews I have only just put 2 and 2 together. This drug is the cause of all the weird symptoms I’ve been experiencing for the past few months. I’ve had multiple doctors visits due to having bad palpitations, chest tightness and breathlessness very regularly for past few months. Had heart ultrasound, and multiple ECGs, doctors have said my heart is fine and it’s my anxiety yet it has nothing to do with my anxiety. This is the best I have ever felt mentally. These symptoms just hit me randomly. Before this drug I didn’t feel like this, It’s truly scary thinking about all the symptoms these drugs cause and doctors insist it’s fine. I’m going to stop taking this ASAP. NEVER AGAIN!",Horrible drug

This is the worse thing I could’ve put in my mouth. My anxiety was off the roof! I ended up in the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack.  I’ve always suffer from anxiety but this time it’s worse. Burning palm sensation, weird sensations in my brain along with pressure. My vision feels foggy and blurry, and I have arm and leg pain, and  depersonalization. The list goes on.  It’s been almost a month and I’m still suffering.  I feel terrible.

7,Nexium,GERD,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 11, 2021",1,"This is a dangerous medication.  I was originally put on 40mg and within a day had the most severe joint pain.  Stopped taking immediately on the advice of GP.  Went back to taking Gaviscon but after several weeks needed something else.  GP advised taking 20mg.  I do suffer from Fibromalagia but I have now worked it out on my own that for the past few months my decline in health must be due to something else.  Lots of blood tests - all fine.  My systems became very worrying.  Increased muscle/joint pain, migraine/blurred vision, stomach cramps, limping due to hip pain.  3 UTI infections within a couple of months, reoccurring nasal cold sores, yeast infection. Had eye tests - all clear.  Doctor suggest migraine meds but I was reluctant.  I have not taken today and cannot believe already how much clearer my head feels and I can actually walk better.

8,Nexium,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 11, 2021",3,"Please be aware that this medication can cause anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Supposedly, it is a rare side effect, but I don’t have any allergies and I’ve never reacted to a medication like that before.When I was 19 years old (now 28) I had major stomach issues. I was diagnosed with gastritis and given this medication. I will never forget how it made me feel. I never want to feel like that again. I stayed up all night crying and staring out the window wishing I could just leave this world. I’m normally a very happy and content person. I will never ever take Nexium again. My doctor was able to give me another medication that made me better but I can’t remember what it was called. I only remember Nexium because of how horrible it was. The best way to describe it is Nexium made me feel like I was going crazy.",RMM
9,Nexium,GERD,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 29, 2021",2,"I couldn't figure out what was going on with me - I had extreme apathy (apathy is when you lack motivation to do anything or just don't care about what's going on around you)...which is very unlike my character. I was struggling with GERD, just short term for unknown reasons so I decided to try the 14 day Nexium course of treatment. I stopped at day 11. I could not stand the mental health effects it had on me. It brought back my anxiety and panic attacks full force.  Why is this not discussed more often? No, none of you are crazy. We can't all have the same issues and be brushed off by the medical profession. I am a registered nurse and will never endorse this medication.",Jamie
10,Nexium,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2021",2,"My cardoligist noticed that I had a cough and thought it might be acid reflux.   I filled the script that day, (40 mg).   The next day my gut was tender, I was light headed, had diarrhea.  Three days in, the pain was worse, my migraines had become daily & acutely painful, nausea persisted, I was flatulent and even that caused severe gut pain.  I felt nausea but thought it was a migraine related problem.  I reasoned all my symptoms could not have been from 10 capsules that were supposed to help my cough.  After I looked on line, I stopped the pills, thinking that would be the end of my pain but 6 days later I am still dealing with some side effects and the pain is just now  easing up.  Thanks to this site I finally put it all together.  Never take ESOMEPRAZOLE, the generic for nexium.  I have never had a side effect to anything, that was this painful, this hard to pin point, and took this long to clear up.",Gin

She literally thought she was dying and took her to the hospital twice. Thankfully before we would get there she would severely throw up and it would slowly go away. Today her grandma mentioned did this happen after taking the nexium and it did so I googled it and found this. It is so true. This medication is not safe. It could seriously hurt someone!,Wooww..

No other pill has given me such problems like nexium. After using it for 2 weeks; got such achy bones all over that I was in constant pain. I have osteoarthritis but not all over as this. My stools are really soft and I go a lot. Sometimes 2x or 3x a day. If I pass gas sometimes I shart myself. I take nexium 3 to 4 times a week. My body can't handle 7 days a week.

Last spring, summer, 2020 symptoms warranted a complete workup - lab , CT, upper endo - increased my nexium to 80 mg a day.  I started (in hindsight) getting  almost daily headaches, more depressed and  irritable, then out of control anger.  I though I was going crazy. I stopped Nexium 3 days ago. No more headaches, feel great, no irritability. I  am now on 40 privacy? 2x a day . This is a horrible drug. Stay away at all costs. Plus , very expensive, - interesting in 3 x as much with insurance so I bought OTC.

It's a drug that actually worked well cured the GERD but I've given up with it as I get headaches, dry mouth, tinnitus twice as bad as normal  and a fatigue like I have flu...the best of the worst for me is Rabeprazole.

26,Nexium,GERD,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 30, 2020",31,"I bought Nexium after the Zantac warning. It helped with reflux but caused constipation fairly quickly. Next I noticed dizziness, then feelings of nausea, followed by extreme tiredness during the day but insomnia causing me to wake in the early hours and be unable to fall asleep again. I became extremely depressed and lost interest in everything. The final straw was noticing that my legs have started to swell and feel tight and my feet are tingling and uncomfortable when I want to relax. The first few symptoms I could live with but the swelling and twitching of my feet and legs is not acceptable, neither is the aching I am experiencing. I am concerned about this to the extent I will be contacting my doctor. I will not be taking any more Nexium, I will  try and control acid with diet from now on.",jay

Like everyone else, after 2 days use, I was severely debilitated - the only thing I could do was to lie down all day, every day whilst using them.  Got all the regular symptoms described by others - shortness of breath, anxiety attacks, palpitations, light headedness, constant bloated feeling etc etc.  3 visits to ER - nil issues found with heart, bloods/xrays done all clear.  Had gastroscopy done - all clear - nil issues at all - shouldn't have taken these meds to begin with. 5 days on after stopping them, I'm still feeling weak, anxious and consistently burping/feeling bloated.  Research has shown these effects (even for short term use) can last up to 2 weeks - I've gone cold turkey and will never take these meds again.  Previous to this, I never had these symptoms.",Pete71

I did not receive the product until Oct. 30th.  I called nexium and complained about the charge.  They said, I needed to call 14 days after trying the product to cancel the agreement,  I was not aware of any agreement because I only asked for a trial, and besides,  I received the product 9 days after I was charged $119.90.  How was it possible for me to try the product in 14 days to cancel the agreement that was not explained to me.  They charged me even before I was able to try the product.  Nexium did not work.

All because Nexium blocks these from being absorbed into the bloodstream -Nexium is available over the counter without a prescription here in the UK  and as such I continued to take it ! Nexium has side effects that are dangerous and life threatening - there are many ways to treat GERD without taking Nexium.

After I stopped Nexium completely the pattern of chronic diarrhoea went away. That is until this past year when I was re-prescribed Nexium to deal with heartburn.When it works Nexium is great and I have no problem tolerating the side effects to gain what relief I can from reflux.

I also had moments where my mind would not stop racing and I would be in a daze.  Everyone was talking around me and I would not be present.  I stopped the Nexium for 1 day already.  The nausea has stopped and so has the diarrhea.  I also have not had any dazed our moments today and my thoughts of dying were much less today.  I also developed crazy depression.",RJN305

I was having severe pressure behind the sternum and almost a twisting or spasmatic feeling there and in my stomach.  It was difficult to breath and then my face and extremities began to tingle.  It lasted for an hour and then finally subsided a bit but my chest remained uncomfortable.  Here we are on day 4 and I have not taken it today nor will I.  My dull chest pains are still off and on.

How can I eat chunky foods, when my body does not have enough juices in my body to break it down due to NEXIUM!
