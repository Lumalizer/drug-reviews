1,Pepcid,GERD,4,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 26, 2019",27,"I had been taking Ranitidine (300mg twice a day), but after that was recalled, I tried Pepcid Complete. It seemed to work for a month or so, taking one in the morning, and one in the evening. But then the acid reflux continued to be a problem so I am here looking at others drug reviews. On the Pepcid website it states: PEPCIDÂ® products are not indicated for the treatment of GERD.I am going to try my luck with Prilosec OTC, based on the reviews that gets on this site.",Duke
