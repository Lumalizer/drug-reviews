I developed akathisia, suicidal thoughts, my brain was talking to me telling me to take me and my dogs life and this is NOT me ! My parents had to watch me everyday until I had to be placed on an antidepressant and had to wait 6-7 weeks until it kicked in ! I’ll never be the same ! 1 year later I'm still on an antidepressant with so many up and down days still completely depersonalized ! So many times I wanted to give up but I prayed every night to keep pushing and saying to myself my future will be so bright couldn’t eat sleep or even bathe myself my family had to take care of me ! With just ONE DOSE ! This pill is so strong ! To do something like this to me I’ve never ever !!! Out of all the meds I had to be placed on and tried for my stomach condition never experienced ANY THING like this ! It may work for some people",Josh H.

3,Reglan,GERD,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 8, 2021",0,"So when I became pregnant, I had the usual morning sickness, that evolved into hyperemesis. This lasted until I was 25 weeks pregnant and was FINALLY prescribed this WONDERFUL drug! I could eat and drink normally, feel not sick, and just finally enjoy the rest of my pregnancy as a happy pregnant lady!! It took 3 days to work. After giving birth, I had the same sickness, further realizing that I had Gastroparesis. (Caused by pregnancy) I was undiagnosed at that point, and they thought it was anxiety. They put me on Wellbutrin which interacted with the Reglan, then I had a Dystonic reaction to the Reglan. That’s the only reason I don’t give it a 10/10. This medicine helped me so much.",Nurse Summers

Normally, I have heartburn and reflux throughout the day.  Not so on Reglan. I hope to stay on it for 12 weeks and have this relief for that period of time..Because of my GERD,  I have been getting esophageal ulcers, esophagitis and gastritis.  I have bad esophageal spasms and have been taking bentyl since July 2020 when the last ulcers were found. I was told years ago I had delayed gastric emptying.",MaggieMoe

7,Reglan,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 14, 2020",28,"DO NOT take this drug... I don't even know hospitals or medical practice's administer this lunatic drug but it should be removed. I was recently in the ER for a very bad acid reflux/GERD flare up and they gave me a GI cocktail, which I'm use to... shortly after, a Reglan/Protonic IV fluid. All was well up until 10 minutes later and I was bugging out! I wanted to jump out of my skin and run out of that hospital. I thought they were going to sedate me, and throw me into a psychiatric unit... It was terrible!!!! I already suffer from anxiety so literally it was anxiety on STEROIDS. I never want to experience that ever again, and I'm still suffering with small side effects from the meds... I'll never be the same",Belladonna
8,Reglan,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 2, 2019",10,I went to the ER with extreme nausea and pain from an ovarian cyst I had. I was given Reglan through an IV before I went home. The nurse told me before he gave it to me that a side effect was having really bad anxiety. Minutes after being given the Reglan I started shaking uncontrollably and broke out in hives all over my body. I had a total freak out moment and have never been that scared in my entire life. DO NOT TAKE REGLAN!!,Jessie

10,Reglan,GERD,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 7, 2016",2,"A word to the wise be sure the Doc. knows what medicines you are on before you take this medicine. I have acid reflux really bad. Went to the ER couldn't breathe, lost my voice, felt like I had an extremely tight chest. They diagnosed me with Gurd, I said I think I have caught the stomach bug. The ER Dr. gave me (2) shots of Reglan and a prescription to fill. Next morning I take my first dose spend the next two days confused, anxious, down and depressed. Looked up side effects of Reglan and realized it didn't mix well with the meds that I take daily and I had been given a little to much at once. After taking a couple days of musinex for congestion, mylanta for my stomach, inhaler to breathe 3 days later stomach bug gone!",69MotherHen
11,Reglan,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 13, 2016",7,"I was prescribed this medicine for GERD. I had not been able to eat or drink anything for a couple days so I was feeling pretty terrible anyway. After I started to take this medicine, I became extremely depressed and anxious. I could not stay awake for more than 20 minutes at a time, and that entire time I was so nauseous I didn't want to be awake. I had terrible back pain and I was shaking like I had been out in the arctic. Finally, my dad told me not to take the Reglan and to see what happened. I skipped my 10 P.M. dose and woke up about 10 A.M. the next day. I felt completely fine, other than my back was still sore. I lost three days of my life to this drug and I can't believe a medicine that is supposed to help you can do so much harm.",Zelda Rose
12,Reglan,GERD,,,"March 1, 2016",21,"When my Mom was  70 years old, she was prescribed Reglan  by her family MD for GERD and ""slow emptying"" of her stomach. She took it 3 times per day with meals and was on it for at least 10 years!! At 83 years old, she has terrible dyskinesia  now, and cannot sleep at night because of her  legs, arms and body  shaking all over the place.  She has tried several other meds to help with the spasms without any luck! She wishes she had never taken Reglan and that her doctor had been more aware of these terrible , debilitating , life long side effects.This is a BAD DRUG  Steer clear of it!!",Lizwiz55

My heart was racing, I couldn't sit still, I couldn't control my eyes. They were rolling around, I couldn't focus on anything.

It works well when combined with Nexium, this combo is only med that works for my gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
