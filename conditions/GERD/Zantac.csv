PPI's Tagamet, which made me VERY constipated.The only one that works for me is Zantac 150 mg twice a day. I know about the recall but I really think it is much to do about nothing since the chemical NDMA they are talking about is found in our food and water.  I am not sure what I am going to do since I am unable to take anything else that gives me relief. I have been taking Zantac for over 20 years with no side effects.",petluv

The sensation can't be held back, it just forces you to vomit, even in the middle of the night when you wanted overnight relief. I was told to get GERD-relieving meds over the counter until doctor prescribed  Famotidine and it works wonders!",Anonymous

4,Zantac,GERD,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 18, 2019",21,"On the recommendation of my stomach doctor, I took a proton blocker for GERD.  Heard about the long term bad side effects so decided to try Zantac.  It was so damn hard  weaning off the proton blocker;  but did with the help of acupuncture and eating more low fat calcium food like cottage cheese.   I take a Zantac thirty minutes before breakfast.  About 11 hours later, I take another Zantac, then eat supper about thirty minutes later.  If I start to have acid, I take a Viactiv calcium chewable and a Viactiv calcium chewable before bedtime.   I avoid acid triggers like onion and alcohol.  Hardly cough anymore and can now sleep on my left side.",Jacque

6,Zantac,GERD,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 15, 2019",17,"I’ve been dealing with chronic nausea and vomiting for almost 20 years. It took 2 years to be diagnosed with GERD because it started out sporadic and kept getting diagnosed as gastritis. Finally started a PPI and life returned to normal. But after a few years, the Rx itself stopped working. So I’d switch to a different brand. Now as a SAHM  (stay at home mother) with 2 small children, my current relapse left me useless and depressed since it’s my youngest son’s birthday. Antiemetics weren’t even helping anymore. But the on call Dr recommended Zantac and I almost instantly felt better! It hasn’t been a full 24 hours yet, so only time will tell if it keeps on working. But right now I’m so happy and grateful to be feeling myself again and able to enjoy my boy’s birthday!",Vanessa

13,Zantac,GERD,10.0,,"July 19, 2018",13,"It works great and it's very cheap OTC in the store brands. My insurance still covers the 150mg zantac in the generic form. I prefer zantac over nexium and prilosec. Both of the PPI's worked well, but I am a chronic pain patient and for some reason while taking nexium or prilosec it would inhibit the morphine ER from absorbing enough and my urine screens wouldn't show the morphine in my system when it was in there. I would stop the nexium or the prilosec, it happened with both of these medications. After  I would stop them, The urine test would start to detect the Morphine ER. test. Both times my doctor sent me to the hospital to get other drug tests that did in fact show the Morphine ER in my system, so after that she put me on Zantac and I haven't had anymore issues.

19,Zantac,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2018",41,"I don't even know where to start. I have never felt more miserable on a drug in my life. Before taking it, I had suddenly been losing a ton of weight and having issues sleeping at night due to waking up cold, shaky, and ill-feeling. An urgent care doctor mentioned that I probably have gastritis and this was given to me. I am currently about three days in and I can't do it anymore. This morning, after taking my morning dose, I found myself almost immediately hit with incredible weakness, nausea, headache, and what must be a panic attack. It's horrible. This drug makes me feel like I'm going to fall asleep, but the second I close my eyes it feels like I'm on a roller coaster and start having unpleasant sounds and visions go through my head. I have actually found myself practically unable to eat most of the time while taking this, even less than I was previously able to without it.",Mvir
20,Zantac,GERD,10.0,,"December 4, 2017",22,"Ever since I put on weight, I’ve been experiencing occasional reflux (about once a week). I never knew how painful reflux could be. Another symptom I’ve been having is regurgitation and belching. At times, I’ll wake up coughing because I’m choking on regurgitate. It’s scary and leaves my esophagus and throat burning. ZANTAC is my go-to. It works every time. Tonight I had reflux and I felt it dissipate within 5 minutes of taking the Zantac tablet. The pain was completely gone in 10 minutes. I’ve also started sleeping with my head up about 30 degrees and that helps too.",AbiRN

At 3AM I resorted to 20 mg of Nexium and another 20 mg an hour later.  Worst night in many years.  Not sure if it takes time for this medicine to build up in my system but I can't suffer from GERD and it did not work the first day.,Slocum C

It was controlled well, I thought, with the Protonix, but it's gotten even better with the Zantac.

24,Zantac,GERD,9.0,,"May 7, 2017",38,"My acid reflux has been so bad that I thought it was bile reflux.  My mouth was sour all the time; my stomach was bloated all the time; I just felt sick.  I tried half a dozen different things including Gasx, prilosec, gaviscon and others.  None of them helped.  I tried Zantac three days ago and have been taking two a day ever since and my symptoms are gone.  Alka Seltzer gives me some immediate relief and I've been taking Alka Seltzer all my adult life, but Zantac just clears up the whole sour mess that has made my life miserable.",marasaud

Waking up in a confused state with vivid images making no sense, yet feeling a need to act on them before realizing the situation wasn't real. Researched on my own and discovered a definite correlation between ranitidine and panic attacks. Stopped taking Zantac 3 weeks ago and have not experienced a panic attack since. Feel like I was reborn. Ridiculous drug with far too many untold or unknown side effects. Stay away from this.

26,Zantac,GERD,1.0,,"May 2, 2017",60,"***ZANTAC CAUSES PANIC ATTACKS***I was prescribed Zantac regularly (1-2x daily) for acid reflux. I developed notably worsened anxiety and nocturnal panic attacks where I would wake up almost every night 2-3 hours after falling asleep with episodes of vivid nonsensical dream-like episodes lasting 2-3 hours. I would have a hard time figuring out simple things like how to open my door or plug in my phone charger to call home. I would keep parents on the phone for 2-3 hours asking them to come get me for no reason even when I had work the next morning. I was constantly confused and dizzy even during the day and it began significantly affecting my work performance. I did research on my own and found out Zantac can cause all the above. I contacted my psychiatrist, who did not know I was on Zantac and they told me Zantac can do this and has had several patients experience this. Since I stopped taking Zantac I have slept full nights with no episodes & minimal to no anxiety. I have never had any experience like this prior to being on Zantac. I would NEVER recommend anyone take Zantac.",AntiZantac

Was not taking any medications for my stomach but my husband was taking zantac so one day I asked him if it would help me. He didn't know so I would looked it up and found it helped a lot of conditions similar to mine.

This occurs from NOT eating, AND eating. I've never experienced anything like this fire. I've tried Nexium, tums, Maalox. None helped me. I bought Zantac just two days ago, and its made a change. I still have to be very strict on timing, and what brings on even harsher acid. HERE IS THE ZANTAC STEPS THAT WORK FOR ME. Eat, and let the acid come on. I don't take it till my food has gone down a bit. Maybe 30 mins after. Its hard to stand the sizzle, but if I take it too soon, I don't feel it. So I take it with a small amount of water at first.

I had missed a week of work from throwing up every little thing even a sip of water and would be stuck there for over 30 minutes and had previously been sick almost every morning and occasionally during the day but always felt nausea and heartburn. Have taken Zantac 150 with prescription meclizine 25 mg and was feeling better the next day.

No heartburn or flare ups of the Acid Reflux. However, I did have reduced sex drive from it. When I was waiting for the prescription to be refilled all the suppressed sex drive from months of medication would hit me all at one time. I also had horrendous withdrawal form it. That is until I got the prescription refilled. Now I have very few flare ups. They went from making me vomit and lasting 3-5 days to maybe 1 day and making me a tad queasy.
