0,Sucralfate,GERD,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 29, 2021",0,I was prescribed Sucralfate liquid by a GI PA. I was sent to GI due to dysphasia and to get an endoscopy. An endoscopy was ordered.

1,Sucralfate,GERD,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 11, 2021",0,"Have bile or GERD refluxing over last 3 months. Super sore burnt oesophagus and I can actually feel the acid spitting up my chest. Doc says likely bile since I have metallic taste too. Started the liquid 4 x day on it two days. So nauseated, off balance, itchy face, but doc said stay on and call him in 4 days. I hope the side effects go away because it is making me miserable.",Ugh
2,Sucralfate,GERD,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2021",1,"I’ve been taking this since Thursday but only 2x a day cuz 3x is too hard for me,  it started with a case of food poisoning and horrid acid reflux that would not go away,  that started my anxiety and I couldn’t do anything,  called my dr he gave me this as a preventative since I had been vomiting and my acid,  could cause problems he said.  Problem is when I take it in the morning I end with a huge stomach ache for about an hour,  I have regular and loose bowl movements all day,  it’s hard to tell what’s anxiety prone and what’s medicine prone.  I only have to take it for 14 days but this is not my favorite happened to me last time and I did not have an ulcer that time either,  just preventative.   But ouch.  Sorry for everyone else’s shared experience.  Hope everyone found or finds relief",Candice long
3,Sucralfate,GERD,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2021",0,"Just started this Rx in tablet form. I have GERD and Dr thinks I may also have an ulcer. I’m waiting for a GI appt. Prescribed at 4x a day, I’ve been able to take it 2x a day.  Bedtime and early morning. I set my alarm an hour before I’m to be up - take my pill and go back to sleep. This 2x a day schedule  seems to be working.  Coughing starts 30 min after taking, followed by a headache on top of my head and slight nausea.  It will finally pass. Overall though, I just don’t feel very good. After reading the reviews, I’m going to try crushing and taking it that way. Maybe I won’t end up coughing. The good side is- this stuff works! Zero pain, zero heartburn. Thank God! I’ve been on Nexium for years, insurance won’t pay for any PPI anymore, pharmacy won’t let me pay out of pocket. (It’s the Law, I’m told)I’ve tried other over the counter PPI to no avail. and eat tums like candy.I don’t take any other medications- thankfully.",The Cat Lady
4,Sucralfate,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 18, 2021",1,"I have been on omeprazole for a while feels like it’s not very strong. Then my gastro doctor recommended surcralfate. I’m supposed to take 4 times a day but there is no way  I could take this 4 times a day.  I took it once and I felt dizzy, weak, off balanced, my heart rate was up all night and I had insomnia. The pill is big to swalllow and it makes you feel like something is like stuck…. Didn’t care for this . I will stop this pills",Mab
5,Sucralfate,GERD,5.0,,"August 12, 2021",3,I have been on this medication for a long time.  I take this 4x times a day.  However just recently my stomach acid has been very bad.  So much so that I'm up half the night.  Because I take other meds for my stomach acid I'm drinking water and eating Tums like candy. Just want to get a good night sleep for once.,MamaD
6,Sucralfate,GERD,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 4, 2021",2,"I'm glad that I read all of these reviews! This is my 3rd day taking the pills. I wish that I would've read them b4 I started taking them though! I was prescribed them 4x a day. Half of the ones that I took got stuck in my throat & I have a strong gag reflex, so that makes it even more difficult to swallow them. I'm gonna try it making the slurry. I've had GERD for the past 25 years & have tried everything but they all eventually stopped working. This is working well so I'm glad that I can take it in a different way. I have noticed a very bloated feeling, which isn't good but maybe it will help me lose weight, lol. It's definitely worth trying it though.",Dinosgirl
7,Sucralfate,GERD,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 4, 2021",7,"The makers of this medicine should put on the label - can be dissolved in water!!!!  This pill is huge and starts to dissolve in the mouth and throat.  My doctor told me to stir it up in a small amount of water and drink it - works like a charm.  Someone else I knew also took it and was negative about the medicine ONLY due to the fact that it is hard to swallow! Come on, manufacturers put this on the label!!",wilson

9,Sucralfate,GERD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 27, 2021",10,"The only thing that works for me! Having been to the emergency room several times concerning the pain I now feel almost normal. My GERD was so bad that it had me bending over in pain. I truly got tired of all the testing, doctor visits and pain. The pain subsided after the second dose of sucralfate. If your doctor prescribes this and you follow the directions, you will feel relief. Antacids really did not do much for me. Too many side effects and it would only work for about 3 hours or less. I also now watch my diet. I honestly think that the preservatives, and chemicals in junk food is the reason for my GERD. I used to chew gum for GERD, it worked temporarily but I had to chew a package than I found out that it had wood resin as an ingredient so now I wonder it played a part in creating GERD in my body. Try sucralfate.!!!!",Betterthanever
10,Sucralfate,GERD,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 25, 2021",22,"Sucralfate, DO NOT swallow because it coats your throat as well. When I was taking it I was having dry mouth, dry throat, trouble to swallow anything,  dry cough, trouble to chew any solid food, and unable to talk and was so weak. Since I dissolve the medicine in water and is helping much better. It is not easy to be taking this an hour before meal 4 times a day, besides Omeprazole. However, the medicine seems working for  stomach. Still having trouble to swallow medicine with capsules. It sticks in my throat, the Gastritis probably constricted my throat. I agree the instruction should written as dissolve the medicine in water. I was cutting into half and swallowed in the beginning ( didn’t know anything), and it was not working still. In my logic, if this medicine coats the stomach, when swallow it, it also coats the throat.Good Luck everyone!",Beba
11,Sucralfate,GERD,10.0,,"April 8, 2021",9,"I have been on Carafate now for eight weeks. I started it because I was having gastritis pains in my abdomen from NSAIDS. It seems to have worked. It does cause me some insomnia I think, and some itching on my face at night. But it helped the gastritis pains. I’m hoping when I go off of it that continues because I am also on Pepcid twice a day. That is for laryngeal reflux which is getting better.Has anyone had an itching experience with Carafate ?Also would like to emphasize that I take this pill so easily. I dissolve it in hot water, ...about 30 mL. I stir it up quickly with a straw and then I suck it down within a second with a straw which gets up every single bit of the medication and then I follow it with half a glass of warm water. The straw makes all the difference because you get all the medication.I don’t drink the water with a straw because that can cause gas.",DeMi

I didn’t have any burning in my stomach .  But next night I started getting the burning again. I’m still belchingn and it so tiring none stop. I’ve changed my eating habits and only drink water   All of this sucks cause I have to use sucralfate for a week doctor says  to see it it will work but I can’t deal with burning and belching  same time.

13,Sucralfate,GERD,8.0,,"February 3, 2021",30,Carafate (sucralfate):I was put on the brand name of Carafate liquid for mainly GERD. This drug works better than the Prevacid I was taking 2 times a day. I only take the Prevacid once a day now because the Carafate works so good for me. It can be hard to schedule because I have to take both a Iron and Vitamin D. But I finally found the best time to fit those in. My question is....starting this month my Insurance company will no longer pay for the brand name. I tried the generic liquid about a year ago and it had a banana taste to it. All my life I have been unable to even smell bananas without getting nauseated or when I was a kid just the smell and taste made me throw up. The pharmacy tried adding flavors to it...it just tastes like grapes and bananas lol But this year Carafate is not even on the prior approval list. There is no way I can pay for this without insurance. I don't know what to do....has anyone ever switched from the liquid to the pill form and had the same results as the brand name liquid?,Gertie

Near zero acid diet and pantoprozole also not sufficient.  Dr said sucralfate would not work right away, however day 1 showed a significant positive effect.  I have been sleeping well and my esophagus is healing for 4 nights now.  I even slipped with a holiday treat mid day yesterday, which clearly was a mistake.  Lots of antacids, alkaline water, and a very conservative dinner, plus the Sucralafate at bedtime was enough!  For me, granted only at day 4, this drug is fantastic.  I wish all others battling GERD to the point of seeking reviews like this well.  Today I feel there is hope.  We will see how it performs over time, as Omprozole was working for 9 months...",Puny

I have the liquid form which works fine.  Am going to see my PA this week to discuss.  Not sure if I'm afraid because I've choked or I choke because I'm afraid it will happen again.

CT said fluid in my esophagus....great.....I've take this med several times when I have flare ups over the years. H2 blockers stop acid, but not the reflux. Proton pump Inhibitors give me horrible insomnia. Prilosec is amazing, but can't sleep at all on it. This med is annoying to take cause you have to plan out all your meals. 1 take 1/2 hour before eating 3 times a day and once before bed. Just a side note, this med didn't work when I swallowed it in pill form. It didn't stop the heartburn, but a doctor years ago recommended I crush it and put powdered pill in water and drink. It has no flavor, so goes down easy. I'm lazy, so I don't own a mortal and pestle. I literally take a glass or mug and crush pill on hard surface.I really recommend this drug.

I am a young adult who started taking this after being hospitalized for swallowing difficulties. My main issue now is Gastroparesis. I noticed taking this medication is increased my lack of appetite and nausea it also made it hard to swallow? I haven’t taken this medication in about a month my appetite is back but my throat spasms are back also.

I no longer have DAILY burning in my chest, stomach, back and mouth. I still have GERD, gastritis and hiatal hernia symptoms, but not as bad as it was. For months my stomach and chest burned, no matter what I ate or didn't eat, and no matter what time of day it was! It was so bad I even went to the E.R., convinced I was having a heart attack... It was hell! I tried Famotidine and it didn't relieve or help my GERD, and Omeprazole gave me a bunch of nasty, side-effects, including some of the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea I've ever had!

My side effects so far are nausea, sore throat and stomach cramp if I don’t eat an hour after taking it. It doesn’t work 100% for me but I’m just grateful I can eat somewhat again even if I’m not completely better. I’m willing to deal with the side effects, what I was going through prior to taking this medication was far worse.

The only downside are the side effects I've had so far are a bit of a sore throat and nausea. The nausea only lasts an hour then I'm good to go. The sore throat is off and on again, I've tried so many acid reflex pill and my acid reflex is still bad but not as bad as it was when I was in the hospital with the constant throwing up.

At first, it was fine, but with each successive day, I started to feel more and more nausea, stomach and back pain in the evenings. The stomach pain feels like fullness and trapped gas that you can't get out. Last night it was so bad it kept me up most of the night. I called the doctor this morning and she advised stopping the Sucralfate to see if it's the issue. From what I've read troublesome side effects with Sucralfate are rare, but when they do happen, it's the same kind of stomach pain and back pain that I've had, so maybe I just don't tolerate this drug well.",Willa

This medication is to heal the stomach and made it so that it heals it well and protects it from ever coming back is what I’m told from the doctor. The only thing I have noticed so far from this medication is that it does give you dry mouth and a dry throat it is always best to keep your mouth clean and ice water helps a lot. The other thing is if you go to Walmart and buy BIOTENE dry mouth moisturizing spray works excellent After brushing and rinsing your mouth you can also use a lip moisturizer if it irritate your lips also finding that you drink  lots Water Yo,Dtan
