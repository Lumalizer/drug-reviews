0,Pantoprazole,GERD,,,"March 29, 2022",3,"I think doctors have to screen their patients better before giving them Pantoprazole or any other of the PPI inhibitors.  The first time I took pantoprazole I felt terrible with feeling out of it and dizzy and chest pains and general feeling like I was going to die. Went off it right away, another year went by and doctor said to go back on it as my GERD was acting up. So tried it again and same symptoms and told my doctor and then he prescribes Dexilant and again had terrible severe reactions to it like could not breath and feeling dizzy and high anxiety.  Went to hospital and doctor there said maybe I am allergic to magnesium and said to take pantoprazole NA with sodium instead of magnesium in it.  Well I took one of those the next day and they are timed released and every 20 mins or so I would get terrible metal/chemical taste in my mouth and then dizzy and left arm feeling funny and more anxiety and headache and pains in stomach and that kept building and getting worse.",Almost DIED

This drug was great day 1 and 2. Day 3 and 4 have been the worst I have ever felt.

4,Pantoprazole,GERD,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 15, 2022",0,"The medication helped immensely when it came to getting rid of the conditions I was feeling due to Gerd, such as chest pains/discomfort, however; it didn't take long to notice the side effects of the medication. The medication caused a lot of gas when eating most anything, my blood flow was very off as my heart rate didn't increase during any physical activity, barely had any energy, had bursts of both anxiety and depressive episodes, a form of temporary ED and this was all only approximately 3-4 days after taking the medication. I had spoke to the doctor regarding all of this but they had explained to me that it wasn't possible that any of these symptoms were caused by the medication especially in such a short amount of time, though looking here it seems some of these symptoms are quite common even on short term. Despite this I stopped the medication on approximately the sixth day. My Gerd symptoms stopped immediately and the side effects disappeared several days after.",Mark

Now I have had a heart attack, have osteoporosis, kidney problems plus I feel my esophogus will never fully heal. Most of my earlier problems were over use of antibiotics and severe food allergys specifically gluten, wheat, dairy. I have always exercised, stayed slim etc but instead of help I was prescribed pantoprazole and never told of all the adverse effects. I cannot take any medication now without adding this PPI. It is hard to get off of it and not worth ever starting.",scotsrish

9,Pantoprazole,GERD,1.0,,"January 7, 2022",0,This drug does not work at all and might have made me have severe nausea. Within 3 days of taking this medication I started feeling super nauseous and could barely eat anything. After a week or two of stopping this medication the nausea got better but the reflux was still not going away so I assume this medication was giving me severe side effects. The nausea could be from food too since I have issues with food and reflux/indigestion. I would not recommend this at all.,Anonymous
10,Pantoprazole,GERD,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 2, 2022",3,"This website has saved me. I thought I was going crazy!! I started taking this drug 2x a day in March of 2021 to cure my chronic gastritis and GERD. At first this really helped me out because the pain I got from gastritis was unbearable and caused me nausea and appetite loss. Over the summer I was prescribed to take it for another year. So around October I started to feel like I wasn’t myself with extreme anxiety and depression. There were many times where I started shaking and panicking for no reason at all. I passed out 2 times, had 3 traumatic panic attacks, and have been dizzy for days. Finally, in December I was at my lowest and started having dark thoughts. I was so anxious, tired, dizzy, nauseous, had stomach pain and was depressed. I was so upset that I started feeling this way and cried to my mom. She found this page and became livid!! Why would my doctor prescribe me with this medicine for mild gastritis and GERD for a 20 years old for a year? Horrible. Don’t take this.",Dianaboo2

12,Pantoprazole,GERD,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 12, 2021",1,"I can't understand all the reviews with horrible side affects. I have taken Prilosec, Pepcid, Dexilant, and now Pantoprazole. I am in disbelief. I have suffered with horrible bloating, constipation, reflux, pain, indigestion, you name it. My bloating was so bad it was interfering with my blood flow and causing fluid retention. My feet and ankles were constantly swollen and my stomach looked like I was 6 months pregnant. I have suffered with this for almost 2 years. All of the sudden my stomach has went down, my feet and ankles aren't swollen, no pain (slight if I don't have a BM), even my energy level had increased. The only thing different I have done is take this medicine. I have had no side effects to speak of. It could be I might have had mild side effects and didn't notice because I was miserable and now I feel great do I don't know. All I know is I rarely did anything because any exertion would cause pain. It's gone. I have a life again. A miracle to me!!",Sue
13,Pantoprazole,GERD,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 8, 2021",0,"I've been taking protonix 12 to 15 years, one tablet a day 40mg .Usually an hour before dinner about 6 PM. I'm 62  and when I was in my 40s I started having trouble keeping food down and eating sandwiches. I had lots of acid reflux.  I took purple pill and all different kind of over the counter pills. Nothing worked so a  good Doctor put me on protonix which gave me Instant relief. Could now eat Fried Chicken or hamburgers with no acid reflux and no bad side effects. But I've noticed over the years it really depends what manufacturer you're taking. Was taking Cadista  and now using camber.Those two are the Best of the seven or eight I've tried by far also Mylan was okay. If you're having bad side effects use one of those three manufacturers. It's best to take one hour before a meal and then stay upright for about two hours before laying down. From the time that you took the pill. What works best for me is take the pill at 6pm, eat at seven lay down at nine go to sleep at 11 pm I am able to stop taking pills for one to two days even one to two weeks",Blessed

15,Pantoprazole,GERD,4.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 14, 2021",1,"I am prescribed 40 mg 2 times a day. I only took my second dose for about 2 weeks because the side effects doubled! Bad headaches, stomach cramps etc. So now I'm back to 40 mg once a day for about 6 months now. Headaches have decreased but I have ringing in my ears at least 10 to 20 times a day that I can count, I'm suffering from severe anxiety, tingling in my hands and chest and side pain. It does however help alleviate my GERD symptoms by keeping the excessive stomach acid from coming up my throat. It hasn't completely kept it at bay because I also have a hiatal hernia but the acid reflux (heartburn) isn't as bad as it used to be. So with the little bit of relief I have experienced while on this menu has been beneficial, I cannot say it is worth the horrible side effects! My anxiety has gotten so bad that it is causing paranoia, sleep deprivation and quality of life interference.

I’m 19 and have never had any prior health issues besides bad acid reflux. I was taking protonix for about a week and started to notice awful headaches. By week two I was having awful dizzy spells and I avoided going to class because I thought I was going to pass out. I thought all of these side effects was related to when I had COVID a month prior so I overlooked it. After taking this medicine for a month I went to the ER twice because I felt like my heart was skipping beats, I was nauseous, couldn’t catch my breath, tingling in my hands and feet, and my dizzy spells were unbearable. The doctors summed it up to panic attacks which I knew was wrong because I’m not an anxious person. I researched protonix online and realized a lot of other people had the same side effects.

I only wanted something to feel less bloated and gassy at night but my doctor asked me to take Pantoprazole for 10 days twice a day. After 4 days of using, my heart started beating fast for no reason in the middle of the night. That brought me panic attacks thinking it’s related to a heart issue. Head feels heavy and feels like something is crawling on the forehead. Besides, I guess it only helps to relieve ulcer pain in the stomach. Did almost nothing for bloatedness. In fact, it made me more gassy at night. I’m gonna stop using it. It gave me more clarity on the side effects after reading up all the reviews here. Avoid using this pill.

Within an hour, I had a migraine headache, extreme gas and bloating, and I was running to the bathroom with diarrhea. I ate the same breakfast that I normally do (some dairy free yogurt mixed with Keto granola-I never have had a stomachache after eating this). I then began to get nauseous as the day continued and was running to the bathroom at work and having to fart embarrassingly loud in the bathroom. I was filled with more gas than ever.

About a month after taking the medication, my experience was very similar to what other people have posted, which in an odd way, made me feel relieved. I started to experience elevated feelings of sadness that were constant throughout the day, anxiousness, would often wake up in the middle of the night with panic attacks, and started to develop hand tremors. After reading the entries on this board, I realized that these feelings were probably the result of the medication, so I stopped taking it.

After 2-3 more month on this med the anxiety morphed into depression, and intrusive thoughts. I had several other side effects that developed such as weakness, and ringing in my ears. After months of trial and error on testing, we finally figured out that my gallbladder was working at 19% and had it removed in June 2021.
