Since it was banned, the doctors have given me all the possible replacements and I'm useless. My life has become a nightmare. Bring Ranitidine back and leave the political games to the people. I am 60 years old and over time I have seen several drugs taken off the market for various childish reasons. It seems that if a drug works well, it is immediately banned and replaced with a two-penny placebo. These are just dirty games inside the pharmaceutical industry.",Gina

A possible cancer-causing (carcinogenic) agent was found as contaminant or unwanted by-product in ranitidine produced by two manufacturers: Sandoz Inc. and Apotex Corp.Since there is no information yet on how or why the contaminant is present in these generic preparations, it is uncertain at this time if this is likely in all current ranitidine products.  It may be due to a variance in temperature during the manufacturing process or some other human error.  I continue to use my round, orange IP 253 pill from a different manufacturer.",Tdiddy

GP then prescribed Lansoprazole and with this the nausea returned. I was then commenced on Ranitidine which for me is a wonder drug. I’m now down to 150mg in evening.

It took 2 years to be diagnosed with GERD because it started out sporadic and kept getting diagnosed as gastritis. Finally started a PPI and life returned to normal. But after a few years, the Rx itself stopped working. So I’d switch to a different brand. Now as a SAHM  (stay at home mother) with 2 small children, my current relapse left me useless and depressed since it’s my youngest son’s birthday. Antiemetics weren’t even helping anymore. But the on call Dr recommended Zantac and I almost instantly felt better! It hasn’t been a full 24 hours yet, so only time will tell if it keeps on working.

18,Ranitidine,GERD,7.0,,"June 29, 2019",7,"300 MG helped a lot but after a few months, it just didn't seem like my GERD was going away and I was still uncomfortable though not in horrible pain so I got switched to a PPI, Protonix to be exact.At the time Protonix was not generic & expensive   so I tried to stick with Rantidine but it just wasn't enough so I stuck with Protonix longterm for about 10 years and was happy until I found out about the longterm side effects.For the last 2 years I've been taking ""Drug Holidays"" from Prontonix  to let my body absorb vitamins that require stomach acid  and taking Rantidine again for a few days but it's just not enough to go on longterm.  I believe Rantidine blocks about 30% of stomach acid (though I've read it's higher) while PPI's go over 90% so it IS quite a bit difference. Anyway, if you have mild GERD, and Rantidine can fix you, stick to it because it's safer than PPIs.  If you have a mild-severe case like me, do everything you can to keep the cancer away.",Nikon guy

Nothing major - but mixing up people's names, not being able to find the right word.  I assumed it was lack of sleep due to having a young child.However, research pointed me toward vitamin b deficiencies as a cause of memory issues AND stomach acid inhibitors possibly blocking the absorption of vitamin b.  I wonder if there was a connection between the 4 years of ranitidine and the memory?Also, gerd started after changing the birth control pills.  Given my terrible heartburn during pregnancy, I wonder if the hormones caused the gerd.  At 44 - I've been off birth control and off ranitidine for years. Heartburn occurs about 1x/month.

Nothing worked (changing to hypoallergenic laundry soap and bath soap, checking anything changed recently). I took him to a dermatologist who tried many different creams, ointments, lotions, etc, which didn't work. So I went back to researching, but further back in the timeline, and came across ranitidine. I found 1 persons case- reported by a Dr- who had gotten a rash. It went away when the medication was stopped. So we stopped it. It took a few weeks but then slowly a few spots disappeared, then more. It took months to totally clear up.The dermatologist never checked side effects to the meds.

Before the surgery I had never thought of surgery as an option. But the GERD got so bad  that I went to the ER with heart complaints. My stomach had gone into my abdomen and was causing breathing problems. There were no heart problems it was concluded after many tests and  $22,000 bill, cover mostly by Medicare.So I went back to my internist and she sent me to a gastroenterologist who said there was a solution. I said, can you operate today, Jokingly. Secretly, I really meant it because I was in so much pain and had a great loss of energy. After doing some tests she scheduled me for surgery the following week.  I'm like, I wish I had done this  20 years ago. I have very little discomfort which I can handle with the generic of Zantac. I feel 20 years younger, and I'm almost to 80! For those of you who don't know about the surgery, I definitely recommend that you look into it. It solved so many problems for me.
