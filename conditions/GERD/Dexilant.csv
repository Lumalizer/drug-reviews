0,Dexilant,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 25, 2022",0,I had severe reactions when taking Pantoprazole so my Doctor put me on Dexilant.  After taking one capsule I felt very spaced out and not with it and then my left arm started feeling numb and funny and got a bad headache and joints hurt but then I got pain and gas so bad it puts pressure on the vagus nerve and feels like your going to die until you release the gas build up.  Looks like my body just can't handle any sort of PPI's      Also terrible taste of chemicals in back of my mouth and lips for very long time.,Didn't Help

3,Dexilant,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2021",1,"Horrible experience. Only took 60mg for a week to help treat heartburn. Made the heartburn 10x worse than before plus tightness in the chest. Non stop headache and body aches. Felt sweaty and feverish. I also experienced terrible anxiety, panic and sadness. Between the constant pain, sudden unexplained anxiety, depression, and inability to focus, it made me feel like I was losing it. I’m 24 hours off the drug and feel 90% like myself again.

I’ve been taking Prevacid for years but it stopped working as efficiently unfortunately, so I was switched to Dexilant. Unfortunately though I believe I’m allergic.

6,Dexilant,GERD,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 9, 2021",1,"I was prescribed 60mg for stomach pain/acid reflux. At first it gave me a headache. After a month and  a half, I got very bad hives and itchy skin from it. I had to stop. Once I stopped, the acid in my stomach was super worse, but I used Gaviscon for a couple of days and I ate healthy since I was told it was acid reflux. No coffee, no black tea, no alcohol, no fatty fried foods, lots of veggies and  low carb and sugar. Nutrition seems to be helping. The acid is reducing slowly. I don't even think I needed the pills. I can't believe they prescribe these before checking your diet with a nutritionist.",June

Once released from the hospital, I was on bed rest for two solid weeks. I learned I am allergic to this class of medication.

15,Dexilant,GERD,10.0,,"January 2, 2021",31,"Dexilant saved my life. That sounds dramatic but it’s true. I’ve suffered with severe GERD since I was a teenager. I had been on a very high dose of omeprazole for years. I’ve also tried all of the other PPIs. I continued to have silent reflux symptoms. For four years, I would get stomach aches and chest pain so bad I would go to the ER and be given opiates. I suspected it was all heartburn but nothing worked to stop the pain. Dexilant was recommended to me once before for my allergy symptoms (possibly worsened by GERD) but I brushed it off because there wasn’t a generic available and I didn’t think it would work better than omeprazole. Let me tell you, it does. It did take a full two weeks to take effect. I haven’t had any pain or GERD symptoms nor any side effects.  I don’t know why it’s so effective but I do believe it has to do with the unique formulation and the fact that it only has to be taken once a day at one dose to reduce user error.",Allie

17,Dexilant,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 8, 2020",30,"I developed GERD as a result of taking medications for Parkinson’s disease that irritated my stomach. Once I’d tried a few acid-reducing medicines that failed to work, my doctor prescribed Dexilant. The first time I took it I had horrible stomach pains and several of the ‘rare’ side effects listed by the manufacturer. Most were what I’d call moderate to severe. Nonetheless I took the medicine again, because I’d been told that it can take a few days for the body to adjust to the drug—and indeed on Day 2 the side effects were much milder and I had no acid reflux. Success!—or so I thought. But Day 3 was a nightmare from the beginning. I had lots of pain—stomach, joint, muscle, throat—terrible diarrhea, and more. And to add insult to injury my reflux returned and continued at regular intervals throughout the day and night. I have never had a medicine make me so miserable or scare me so much. Need I say I can’t recommend this drug?",Sam D.

19,Dexilant,GERD,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 29, 2020",20,I have GERD which has worsened in the past year. My throat was narrowing and it hurt in my side every time I swallowed. 60 mg of Dexilant is the only thing that has helped. It took a couple of months but now I barely have swallowing problems anymore. The only problem is that I have been on it for over 6 months now and I know it’s time to taper off but if I go off it for a day by the next day my throat starts to narrow again and it’s once again difficult to swallow. I’ve tried replacing it with Prilosec but that doesn’t help with the swallowing. Only Dexilant works. I guess I’m stuck on it!,Wellred
20,Dexilant,GERD,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 17, 2020",10,I moved got stressed was started on this wasn’t really doing much I went to Zantac did better. Then I was put in antidepressants and the trouble began worse  so they gave me this drug as the others weren’t working. Then told me to double it I felt horrid gas muscle pain it doubled my mental health state. Since then I’ve had iron issues stopped the antidepressants as I was so constipated I had to do enemas all of the time. That didn’t solve the problem. My GI Dr said take gaviscon whatever you need on top of it. Well I stopped growing hair on my legs I’m so bloated nauseous since I have been on meds. I’ve tried to stop the dexilant but it comes back worse the stress from the bloating muscle pain dry throat nausea. When I go to the bathroom it feels like squeezed dried air and no relief feeling.

I was told to double up on Dexilant.  Not financially doable.  Let me say something about the manufacturer, Takeda.  They have an assistance program and have been amazing to me.  I love them.  Because of their assistance, my money is freed up to pay doctor bills.  They care about their patients.  I am pretty upset about my recent complications.

This medicine works well almost all the time BUT, it seems every now and then I get a batch that does NOT work as well....almost like the capsule is not filled properly, and I need to supplement these dosages with a Nexium or take a Pepcid Complete to carry me. This usually goes away when I receive a new Rx presumably from a different batch. This happens infrequently, but I do not attribute this to a change in my habits nor health.

It helps cure it not just cover it up like the others try to do. It's better to have something that eventually heals it so you don't even require medications. And it's waaaay better than evasively having your stomach tied up around your esophagus.
