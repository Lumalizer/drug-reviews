0,Metoclopramide,GERD,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 11, 2022",0,"This was so awful it gave me side effects of  severe palpitations for 10 hours straight, tried everything I could think of to get rid of it - nothing helped. Due to Covid I avoided going to the ER because local hospital had an outbreak and shortage of staff - will never take this medication again!

1,Metoclopramide,GERD,1.0,,"August 28, 2021",2,"I was given this drug for sickness in 2019 . I was on 10mg per day and at the beginning it worked a treat.After a month of taking it I began to feel down and anxious, having never experienced depression and anxiety before I wondered what was going on. It got  worse and worse and it was only when I read the side effects (1 in ten people suffer depression as a side effect,)  I realised what might be happening, my GP advised me to stop the drug . I am now on anti depressants and have to deal with anxiety on a daily basis . I've gone from someone who was fine emotionally to someone who us far from it. I believe this is a result of metoclopramide.",Anne
2,Metoclopramide,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 22, 2021",2,"Reglan (metoclopramide):Side effects experienced with reglan: Reglan made me suicidal depressed almost took my life !!! Was scared to death . I developed akathisia, suicidal thoughts, my brain was talking to me telling me to take me and my dogs life and this is NOT me ! My parents had to watch me everyday until I had to be placed on an antidepressant and had to wait 6-7 weeks until it kicked in ! I’ll never be the same ! 1 year later I'm still on an antidepressant with so many up and down days still completely depersonalized ! So many times I wanted to give up but I prayed every night to keep pushing and saying to myself my future will be so bright couldn’t eat sleep or even bathe myself my family had to take care of me !

3,Metoclopramide,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 25, 2021",0,"9 doses of metoclopramide, 3 days of 3 tablets a day for stomach flu. No side effects, cured my incessant vomiting. Now 2 weeks later I had gaviscon. Interaction caused belles palsy on the right side of the face and severe back pain. Next day, severe panic attacks and anxiety. One more day, severe debilitating neck pain. Symptoms are beginning to clear up - but anxiety and persistent panic attacks remain. To reiterate... first side effect happened TWO WEEKS after medication. I think this drug should be banned. Side effects are real and debilitating. ""Anxiety"" does not cut it. I am not an anxious person, but this made me think I was going to die for weeks. Terrible drug.",Help.

7,Metoclopramide,GERD,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 8, 2021",0,"Reglan (metoclopramide):So when I became pregnant, I had the usual morning sickness, that evolved into hyperemesis. This lasted until I was 25 weeks pregnant and was FINALLY prescribed this WONDERFUL drug! I could eat and drink normally, feel not sick, and just finally enjoy the rest of my pregnancy as a happy pregnant lady!! It took 3 days to work. After giving birth, I had the same sickness, further realizing that I had Gastroparesis. (Caused by pregnancy) I was undiagnosed at that point, and they thought it was anxiety. They put me on Wellbutrin which interacted with the Reglan, then I had a Dystonic reaction to the Reglan. That’s the only reason I don’t give it a 10/10. This medicine helped me so much.",Nurse Summers
8,Metoclopramide,GERD,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 1, 2021",4,"I was prescribed this drug metoclopramide for persistent GERD/functional dyspepsia symptoms. It worked beautifully within a matter of days. I was taking it 3 x a day. I started feeling a little anxious a week or two after starting this drug but I didn’t put two and two together. I was on it for 6 weeks-4 of which were plagued with anxiety and not feeling like myself at all. After doing some research I realized it could be a side effect from the drug. I quit cold turkey on Jan. 1, 2021 and had horrible depression for 2 days followed by anxiety for 2 weeks. I thought it would never go away after reading some other reviews online. I’m happy to say the side effects do go away and to hang in there. This drug does wonderful things for some people but causes debilitating side effects for others. I recommend trying something different. And if you’re in the middle of an anxiety or depression spiral since coming off of this drug, please trust that it gets better.",Elle

I don't even know hospitals or medical practice's administer this lunatic drug but it should be removed. I was recently in the ER for a very bad acid reflux/GERD flare up and they gave me a GI cocktail, which I'm use to... shortly after, a Reglan/Protonic IV fluid. All was well up until 10 minutes later and I was bugging out! I wanted to jump out of my skin and run out of that hospital. I thought they were going to sedate me, and throw me into a psychiatric unit... It was terrible!!!! I already suffer from anxiety so literally it was anxiety on STEROIDS. I never want to experience that ever again, and I'm still suffering with small side effects from the meds... I'll never be the same",Belladonna

Worked great for 18 months, then it all broke loose. I had side effects of severe akathisia, panic attacks, whole body seizures,  skin felt like it was on fire, uncontrollable muscle spasms mostly in my legs, peripheral neuropathy in my hands, feet and face. Eye and face twitches, grinding teeth and tongue movements. I went into such a dark time but knew it was the drug so I  rode it out with the help of Lorazapam. 10 years later, still have most symptoms but not as severe. Definitely destroyed the quality of my life. Do yourself a favor, whatever your problem is, you'll get over it, this drug, you will never be the same again. It should be BANNED!",Stretch

18,Metoclopramide,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 30, 2019",9,"Could you maybe make a version of this drug that doesn't cause brain damage? If not no big deal, but my girlfriend hates that she has brain damage and acts like a chronically angry person like its my fault. In all seriousness, this drug is awful. It gets a 0 because its marketed as a medicine but actually is a poison. My girlfriend was on it two days and it completely ruined her life. Metoclopramide does not cause ""side effects"", it induces permanent pharmalogical torture. Shame on the makers and those who approved it. Shame on the doctors who continue to prescribe it knowing what it does, and who minimize the pain they cause their victims. This drug takes lives. If it doesn't kill you, you'll spend the rest of your life wishing you were dead.",RH6557

There is stuff your doctor can do and get them to prescribe diazepam for the agitation at first. I also found a useful article which describes the symptoms that I had and cites a journal article which uses N-Acetyl Cystene 2mg does every day for twelve weeks as being effective. One of the worst experiences I had until I took control.. do not take there is nothing they can do for an answer.google Akathisia and see what you find",Sammy1977

27,Metoclopramide,GERD,1.0,,"January 10, 2016",6,"This medication worked fine to reduce pain in chest associated with gerd. However, after about a month taking the medication up to three times a day, I was nearly put on anti depressants. As I was taking the medication I noticed an increase in restlessness, general anxiety and finally insomnia. This was incredibly hard for me to deal with as I'm generally a happy, positive person. I could not understand what was causing the anxiety and I became very low. I was at my wits end when I realised that the time frame of the anxiety I was suffering and my taking the maxolon matched up. One day without the maxolon and I felt much better, more like my own self. I slept better and was more relaxed. This medication can cause serious side effects!",RosieRR

Second time was by mistake because the specialist prescribed it and I didn't remember the drugs name. I have been suffering from bad acid reflux and gastritis so my physician prescribed it the first time. I took it and it was horrible! I wanted to literally jump out of the roof. Nothing was making me stay still. Is hard to explain feeling but is basically not able to sit still and even if you try to move, you still feel the horrible feeling. Nothing stops it. I didn't know about antidote so I have to endure it TWICE all by my own. My Doctor already placed this drug on my hospital's profile as if I was allergic for just in case.
