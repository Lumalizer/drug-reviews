0,Famotidine,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2022",0,I had the worst experience of my life this morning. I was given this horrendous drug yesterday and took one last night. I woke this morning and literally couldn't breath. Couldn't even talk. Had to rush to A@E. Oxygen levels were low had to have an ECG and was put on a nebuliser. Omg this drug is going to kill someone. Please be careful. Scared me to death and still wheezy.,Abby

2,Famotidine,GERD,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 25, 2022",0,"Please do not take this drug. My son was on Ranitidine for years with no side effects but when they took it off the market- they prescribed Famotidine. Right away I noticed me son was not sleeping at night, it was like he was wired for days. He was up and irritable and moaning a lot and at night he would wake up throwing up so bad and would have trouble breathing. After this happening for a few nights I realized it was probably the medication so I stopped giving him it and by the second night he finally was sleeping through the night without waking up throwing up. He also has had several dilation of his throat and when he was on famotidine he developed lumps in his throat and I told his Gastrointestinal doctor I think it is from the famotidine and he said probably not. So the next dilation was 3 months later and I was not giving him the famotidine and guess what the lumps miraculously disappeared. He also is diabetic and it was affecting his insulin.",Sassy Chicago

4,Famotidine,GERD,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 8, 2022",14,"I have been having reflux problems for 2 years. After gallbladder removal my GP started me on Famitodine!! My problem was getting worse but never thought it could be this drug, then I came across this site and all the patients that had been taking it , and I absolutely agree with you all this drug is awful!! Side effects of headaches, fatigue, constipation, depression and muscle spasm cramps. So to all of you that have suffered with this poisoning drug NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN. It is my first day stopping them so probably in for a rough ride not that I care as long as these get out my system they WANT BANNING!!!!!!",Val
5,Famotidine,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 4, 2022",0,"Diagnosed with GERD a few years ago. Also mild gastritis after gastroscopy. Started with Omeprazole but switched to Lansoprazole due to side effects. I have had a few flare ups in the past but recently got a bad one. GP gave me Famotidine 2xD. Within hours of taking the first dose (20mg), I started to feel sore in lower back. After the second dose, I was having sharp intermittent (every 1-5 minutes, lasting just seconds) sharp pains in my mid back. Maybe it is a coincidence but reading the comments here, it sounds like side effects can be quick to appear. Anyway, I have stopped taking it. It's been about 30 hours since the last dose but I still have the sharp pains. Anxiously waiting to see if the effect will subside or if it is something else to worry about.",DocSmurf
6,Famotidine,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 26, 2022",0,My first night on it last night and I'm not sure. I woke up midnight with SEVERE PANIC ATTACK. I mean out of no where. Some numbness but that could be covid or anxieties. I don't like to jump to conclusions but my acid reflux burns now in my chest after I took the medication. I don't think I'll continue these meds. I had an acid attack after taking advil so I just hope the docs know what they say and are doing.,Buddy
7,Famotidine,GERD,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 11, 2022",3,"After about a week on famotidine I didn't really notice where it was helping me with the heartburn that I had. I had to supplement the famotidine with over-the-counter antacids like Pepto-Bismol or a bicarbonate tablet. But I would say about five or six days into taking famotidine I start to have palpitations and feelings of discomfort in my chest and then with that came on feelings of anxiety and other symptoms like my muscles hurting sides and my back hurting feeling like my kidneys are hurting just all. I started to have slight headaches for no reason and I drink a lot of water per day. I do not recommend H2 blockers and PPI's because just tweaking your diet can actually help your digestive tract a lot better than swallowing this garbage that actually damages your stomach and your intestines in the long run. I would not recommend famotidine to take longer than a week and I have noticed in some of these reviews people have been on this medicine for a year-wow, I can't do it!",LadyWeapon
8,Famotidine,GERD,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 22, 2021",2,"Stay away from this drug and let me tell you about my experience.  I’ve suffered from acid reflux for a number of years. I went to a doctor and was prescribed this medication once daily. I was on it for roughly two years and never felt worse. Although it did help with my GERD, it ruined me in other ways. I had insomnia, anxiety, weight loss, etc. I could not put my finger on why I felt so lousy until I started to narrow down what could be going on. I then realized that the only medication that I was on was Famotidine so I decided to do my homework. After reading other horror story reviews about this drug, I decided to stop taking it and see if this was the cause of why I felt so crappy. Sure enough, it was the root cause. Shortly after going off of the Famotidine my anxiety was gone, I was sleeping soundly again and I have put on 10lbs in just two months. I have now been off of the Famotidine for six months and I’ve never felt better.",Corey
9,Famotidine,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 20, 2021",1,Worst pills ever. They don't relieve my acid reflux and they keep me up all night. It's like I'm on speed when I take them. I can't sit still and clean my house like a maniac when I'm on them. The crash the next morning is horrible and my entire body aches. Switching back to Omeprazole. This stuff is garbage!,Sky
10,Famotidine,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 18, 2021",2,"Took famotidine 20 mg/day for a few weeks back in September 2020. Had the worst side effects: Shooting pains in head, racing heart, chest pains, head pressure, burning skin on my arms, muscle spasms on my stomach and collar bone, stiff neck, stiff lower back, stomach issues, GI issues, fatigue. I had the worst feeling of anxiety coming from my stomach. I never knew what anxiety was until I had this experience. I never had problems sleeping before this. It felt like I was poisoned.  Took me a week to realize it was the famotidine. I stopped it immediately. Some of the side effects gradually went away. I took magnesium and started b12 supplementation. Took zantac for years and never had any issues. Many people I spoke with said their side effects went away after 3-4 months. However, I am still dealing with many side effects a year later. If there is anyone who has any insight into this/recommend a doctor who has helped them through this I would greatly appreciate any help.",Craig

My  chest was really tight head felt kind of funky and then felt real bloated unfortunately I also have an enlarged liver due to gallbladder stones I don’t know if it’s from the medicine or if it’s because of what’s going on with me but I stopped taking it and will find an alternative,John dough
13,Famotidine,GERD,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 6, 2021",0,"I've been on famotidine for about 3 months & was advised by my doctor to taper down and stop taking omeprazole for GERD symptoms. Famotidine does absolutely nothing, though, and while I can get by with only taking omeprazole every other day, if I try to go any longer than that without taking omeprazole, the reflux symptoms kick back in worse than they were before. We're talking, ""gets heartburn even from milk"" without the omeprazole.I'm sure famotidine works for some folks, but it does nothing to ease my symptoms.",Berani

My son took some last night as well and burped so much. Even though the half-life says 2-3 hours, I definitely believe that the side effects last longer.

19,Famotidine,GERD,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2021",0,First off let me say this medication is not for everyone. It's has helped me tremendously so far but my GERD is so bad that I'm puking from it and it feels like I'm having a heart attack whenever it's happening. The only side affect that I've had from taking the medication is feeling too full whenever I eat something. This is the 2nd day that I've taken it. Other then that I've been ok.

20,Famotidine,GERD,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 10, 2021",6,"I waited until the evening to take this the first time. I already take Rabeprazole which hadn’t been effective lately so my GP told me to take 20mg alongside my regular medication. After taking this, I began to feel sick within the first hour which progressively got worse during the night - I didn’t actually vomit but it felt close. I got pains in my chest, a strange sensation in my throat, headache and terrible anxiety. It also didn’t stop the heartburn discomfort. Didn’t sleep much. The following day, my anxiety was still bad, heartburn was awful to the point I only managed to eat two slices of toast the entire day and the throat feeling wouldn’t go away (like something was stuck in my throat). I also got strange chest pains like my heart was skipping or something. I had had a few ok days prior to taking this medication and feel like I have ruined any progress I was making. The anxiety that this is causing is ridiculous. I would tell anyone never to touch this stuff.",Felofena61

24,Famotidine,GERD,10.0,,"September 23, 2021",0,"WE took another drug for GERD which was pulled off the market.  We switched (two of us) to Famotidine but a generic, we were both within two days back to acid, nausea, and no relief.We then found the TEVA version and within  two days of starting back on that, no symptoms, at all.   I have to drive an hour to pick up the TEVA as no one near me carries it.  It is 1/2 of the price of the other generic with my insurance and that helps pay for the gas.  I went to an independent drug store to find this. Cannot say enough good things about the way this works.  We take it with breakfast and dinner, 40 mg.",Doctor REC
25,Famotidine,GERD,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 19, 2021",1,"OK. So I’ve used this over 2 periods I’d different ways. Originally, I was prescribed one tablet at night. This was effective, but by the day the acid reflux was back. It’s not listed on drug interactions, but it appears it react with anything over 25mg of pregabalin. I gave up and suffered for a few more months.A few weeks ago I decided to give it another go, starting with one tablet a day, also reducing Pregabalin. This time things were better. It was deeply unpleasant for 2 weeks, but went down to quite unpleasant as I got used to it. At this point I went up to 2 tablets a day, which caused stomach cramps for 3 days. After that, it’s been fine. I’m now used to Famotidine and I feel much better with the GERD. It’s not a perfect solution, you have to be prepared for your body rebelling against it, but 2 weeks of pain for ongoing relief is a trade off I think is worth it.",Monkie

I truly felt like she was going to die. I couldn’t figure it out.. I would have never thought in a million years it was this until all of the symptoms match with hers and I give her CLEAN breastmilk. I stopped the medicine immediately and the next day I had a whole new baby. She couldn’t sleep longer than 20 min at a time. Intense rubbing of her mouth so I thought she was getting a tooth or something! Crying like I’ve never heard before. Absolutely terrifying. She stopped smiling the last couple days she was on it.

If there is any bad side effects to medications I will have them, so I read all of these before deciding to take this. I just threw my bottle in the garbage that was prescribed by my Gastro Dr, after reading these HORROR stories.  It is so frustrating that these conventional medicine doctors just want to give you a band aid to try and cover up your symptoms (that rarely ever work) instead of getting to the root cause and healing your body. I suppose they are just not trained in this.   I am now going the functional medicine route for my digestive issues and will never go back to them after 10 years of no resolve.

I have night time reflux so I used to take these at night, and one night I took one and I couldn’t sleep all night. I got anxiety from it + I would have these muscle spasms that felt like earthquakes. 10/10 for relieving acid-reflux symptoms, 0/10 for its side effects.

I found 20mg lasts around 10 hours and 40mg lasts around 14 hours in my body. I made sure to space the dosage out between 12 hour periods. Also drank lots of water, the medicine comes out of your body through your kidneys. I read people with kidney issues might have problems with this medicine. For me this medicine worked ok.

I feel like it is really damaging me and I'm going to the ER tomorrow because I don't know what else to do. This is the worst drug I have ever experienced.",no pepcid ever

54,Famotidine,GERD,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 23, 2020",58,"I have been on omeprazole for about a year and prior to that, pantoprozale  because of ibuprofen therapy which caused stomach problems. Doctor said a  PPI is necessary.  Well, recently the side effects increased on omeprazole and I encountered trapped gas throughout my ribs, intestine and bowels with excruciating pain. Omeprazole lists c diff as a side effect with sepsis and this had me scared. I got off it and am taking the famotidine before bed, 40mg. After one night, I slept with my ongoing meditation and woke up fantastic. The real test was eating, readjusted my food intake to smaller bites. Went all day with very little pain, slight bowel/stomach gurgling and passing the trapped gas. The famotidine allowed the muscles to relax enough for a proper movement. Took with food, saltine crackers and 6oz glass of water. It did make me sleepy but not overbearing. If pantoprozale and omeprazole aren't effective, I recommend famotidine because it works differently.",jewels

Acid issue was becoming worse, Dr. prescribed 40 mg Famotidine, 1 x day.  At first it helped along with changing to a bland, non-fatty food diet (I lost 25 lbs, hoping to lose another 10).  Advised Dr. of waning relief, he increased dosage to 2 x day.  I experienced worse effects, acidic stomach along with diarrhea, bloating/gas if I ate/cheated on diet, (1 whole egg instead of just the whites).  Same reaction to other spicey or fatty foods in small quantities, not whole meals.  Went back to 1 x day for a week, then I stopped taking the medication for one day and felt better, no excessive acid after eating 6 oz of steak.  Previously under the med, a hamburger caused the worsened symptoms.  Will stay off the med and continue with diet and limited intake of fatty & spicey foods.

So on this I notice I feel bloated after 12 hours of taking it even though at first it got rid of my acid reflux within like 15 mins. However I woke up almost in a panic feeling like I was gonna have a heart attack, I was burping excessively to the point my stomach feels in knots, I can't sleep a full 8 hours. I wake up like every 2 hours or can't even go back to sleep at all and I work night shift. I even feel like my muscles wanna just spasm out of control. And I feel like my heart beat is irregular right now too, it's crazy to think a drug can do this. Much like someone else said here I'd rather have the acid reflux as this is torture; who would ever make a drug like this. What ever happened to safety, this stuff is not safe, but DR. has determined this will do more good then cause you harm. THAT'S A LIE.
