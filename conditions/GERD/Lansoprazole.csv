1,Lansoprazole,GERD,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 20, 2022",0,"I been taking gaviscon for a few months now and I’m experiencing really bad heartburn well I say that it’s like a burning in the throat and chest, I keep wondering why the doctor give me lansoprazole so I start to take them I feel okay, I only take them when needed but I find if I don’t my acid is more effective I feel like it’s burning that bad I feel sick I’m constantly having it, even if I eat certain foods, drink anything. Whatever I do it’s there. I’m scared that means I'll get stomach cancer if I take for a long period time so I’m gonna speak to GP see if they can suggest something else. I wouldn’t advice this medication if your worried as I have bad anxiety and depression so it makes it 10x worse for me. I was told not to keep taking them as it can cause risks of stomach cancer by doctor. But I will say I do take it  at night as I suffer more lately at night. Lansoprazole does work but just worry’s you why doctors give this.",Sam

3,Lansoprazole,GERD,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 11, 2021",0,"I was feeling sick randomly it would come on and then go again, no real reason, patterns or dietary issues that I could find.  I lived with it for about 2 months, then it started affecting my ability to actually enjoy myself for fear of constantly feeling sick.  It got worse as I started with heavy mucus like throat, it was strange how the symptoms changed overnight but they did seem to.  My GP got me onto these tablets and within 6 hours I felt absolutely incredible, all of the ill feelings I'd had just vanished away.  Don't get me wrong, they return occasionally - but this drug really puts them at bay.  The only complaint I have is they cause really powerful headaches for me, paracetamol doesn't seem to touch the pain either.  It's a trade off I can live with though to be honest.",Aztec

My problems continued to get worse until I sought help from the GP in November 2020, it had been almost two years since I started the Lanzoprazole. I was prescribed antidepressants then another, some diazepam on top for the anxiety. It was only when I read up on the side effects in the BNF that it all clicked. My mental health symptoms and insomnia correlate with a similar time to the start of the PPI.I’ve been off Lanzoprazole and antidepressants successfully for three months now and I feel like the old me!!!! I’m sleeping better and I’m not plagued by low mood and anxiety. Think twice before you take this drug. It’s very unpleasant.",Bee

While I was on lansoprazole I had not slept properly for years and had leg twitches all night, I was also diagnosed with anemia. I was off food and losing weight constantly. I went from 11 stone to 7 and a half. I hadn’t put any of these problems down to the pills and neither did a doctor. Since stopping them I’m sleeping better, no leg cramps, and I've noticed I’m not nearly having all of the heart attack symptoms when I walk around outside. I’m getting bloods done next week to check on the anemia and I've got a feeling I don’t have it anymore. I feel loads better off the pills and I don’t even have reflux anymore.",Gill_30
6,Lansoprazole,GERD,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 4, 2021",6,"It's okay for acid reflux that (no doctor has termed it for me) has no specific cause other than long-term dietary intake of alcohol and spicy foods and the like. Not quite the same as rennies where it's an instant neutralization of stomach acid, but it feels like it controls it and lasts for quite a while.Side effects to report are: it feels like, and I know this will sound odd, but the acid instead of being neutralized almost finds it's way into my muscles, not sure about the medical name for this.The other, disturbing one is erectile dysfunction which just my luck I get temporarily with just about any medication I try even if it's in the ""very rare"" category for side effects, thought it was only in my head after trying it but no seems like it can happen, maybe I'll have to switch to a different one.",Cam

It has given me awful side effects and somehow made the reflux WORSE in just a week and I'm not sticking around to find out how it's going to be in one more. I have to note that the plain omeprazole and esomeprazole I was taking before this gave me one-to-zero side effects. Do not take this med unless it's a last resort.,N. L
9,Lansoprazole,GERD,1.0,,"March 14, 2021",1,"I started on 30mg of Lansoprazole for 4 weeks; it worked very well, no more acid reflux and I could eat everything. Two days after coming off these pills my condition became 10 times worse. I started choking at night because my throat was producing foam to protect itself from acid. I could not eat anything without getting severe burning at the centre of my chest. I lost 2 stones in weight. I was put on 60 mg of it and Ranitidine before bed and Amitriptyline. It took 7 months to gradually reduce to 30 mg a day. However I started getting foaming problems again. I have had to go back to 60 mg daily. The foaming has not gone away after 6 weeks. I just cannot see an end to this cycle. I would suggest if you ever go on these drugs, you take your time coming off them. Taking 15mg less every month.",Sid

I had switched from Omeprazole to Esomeprazole without any drama whatsoever so I figured I could go ahead and make the change to Lansoprazole the same way.Long story short ... I could not!  A couple weeks into the medication swap I started noticing a ""fluttery"" feeling in my chest and only then did I read that irregular heartbeat is a fairly common side-effect of this PPI.Let this be a lesson to everyone as it was to me ... even OTC medications have potentially significant differences that could be potentially dangerous.",Captante

They work fine but if you develop serious side effects as I have you are stuck taking them because they are almost impossible to get off of. The rebound pain and heartburn are even worse than the serious side effects. You then suffer from both problems at the same time. These pills suck the very life out of you. Use Pepcid or Tagamet.

My heart rate goes up, upper back aches.  I restart it if symptoms come back. I'm also celiac, with histamine level issues and sulfite sensitivity. Lansoprazole has high levels of sulfites so if I eat food that's high in them it starts to overload the body. Once it has returned to normal I restart and adjust diet as best I can.

I went to a top notch gastroenterologist and he said he needed to test the ph of my esophagus/stomach. I had to stop taking Prevacid seven days before procedure. Without it, I felt like I was having a heart attack. I have broken both my ankles and shoulder and I wasn’t really doing anything! I have numerous health problems that I believe stemmed from this drug that was prescribed when I was in the hospital from a major asthma attack. It kept the heartburn/reflux at bay and didn’t exacerbate the asthma (wheezing and coughing).

I had violent diarrhea for 18 days, nausea, cramping, loss of 7 pounds, headache... even went to the ER because I was feeling so badly. I took a list of my medications and no one mentioned the complications.  No one considered the lansoprazole pill. I was told to eat a soft diet, rice, broth , potatoes,.etc.  I continued to take the pill a few more days, my weight falling, much gurgling, lack of interest in food or life in general, sweeping nausea and running for the bathroom as many as 15 -20 times a day and literally all night.
