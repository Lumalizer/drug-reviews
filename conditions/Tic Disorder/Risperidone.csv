0,Risperidone,Tic Disorder,2,,"March 21, 2022",0,"I was prescribed risperidone about a year ago I took it for around 6 months. It didn’t help with my tics all that much but it basically made me a zombie. I didn’t feel emotions really and couldn’t cry, it was just very numbing it was actually scary. I took myself off of it cold turkey (don’t recommend) and then ended up going through a manic episode. It could work for you but for me it didn’t really.",Anonymous
1,Risperidone,Tic Disorder,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 30, 2020",2,"risperidone gave me awful weight gain side effects, made me tired all the time, all on a tiny dose. Made my Tourette's way worse. Can't imagine how bad it would be on a bigger dose. Not worth it.",Blackcat
2,Risperidone,Tic Disorder,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 6, 2017",13,"I have OCD and trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling). I started taking Risperdal in Jan of 2016 (age 18), and was up to 1mg in March. I still had not noticed changes in my behavior as far as the pulling went or the obsessive thoughts. In a last ditch effort to see if the Risperdal would be effective, we went up to 2mg. After three weeks, I noticed a huge change in behavior. I had little urge to pull anymore. It was such a relief. But then came the long term side effects. I stopped getting periods and my eyes started twitching. I'm now being weened off the drug because of the side effects. The drug seems to work great for OCD and trich, but the side effects ended up being too much for me to manage.",Siwithlove
3,Risperidone,Tic Disorder,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 30, 2015",60,"I have been taking this medication for over a month at the 0.25mg dose, once daily. I have moderate facial tics that become more severe with anxiety, with my eyes, nose, and mouth twitching at least several times a minute. My psychiatrist prescribed me risperidone and I read online that many people suffer weight gain from this medication. I have had no weight gain at all and no change in appetite, most likely due to my low dosage. From the first dose I took I noticed my tics were reduced significantly, and I remember thinking, ""this is what it feels like to be normal!"". My tics are almost entirely gone and I used to be reminded of my tics every waking second but now half of the time I forget I even have tics. This drug saved my self-esteem.",Yasmin P
