0,Midodrine,Hypotension,3,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 9, 2022",1,It got me up to a normal blood pressure which was so nice but I cannot tolerate the side effect.  Each  time I take it (without fail) my scalp becomes SO ITCHY it’s unbearable.  I need to talk to my doctor and see if I can try something else for my low bp.,MLM
1,Midodrine,Hypotension,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 26, 2021",4,"I was prescribed this for my low blood pressure. I was hoping it would work (which it did not). I tried it and it gave me such bad chills, prickling sensation and gave goosebumps all over my body for several hours straight.. up to almost 10hrs. My dose was 5mg TID (three times a day). It made my nerve damage worse by making hurt and have a pinching sensation. For the side effects it was not worth it, even if there was a chance it would have worked, I still would have not taken this drug. It was awful and I felt like I was being tortured. It was horrendous and up there on the most painful and yuckiest side effects one could experience from a drug. I am lost and tried more pills, salt and compression stalkings. I am currently waiting for my insurance to approve of another drug that suppose to help with increasing my blood pressure, but not having luck. Until then I have to deal with the lows and being symptomatic sometimes, which is fatigue, palpation, dizziness or near passing out.",Lsimp0064
2,Midodrine,Hypotension,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 20, 2020",15,"I suffer from both hypotension (70/40 on a good day) and chronic fatigue syndrome. I needed to get surgery on an unrelated issue and we were worried about my blood pressure. So my Doctor decided to try Midodrine 10 mg up to 3 times a day. Without exaggeration this saved my life. I can now not only sit up but stand without passing out, furthermore I can stay awake like then 3 hours a day. Does this give me chills and goosebumps? Yes. But my goodness, I have my life back. I'll take the goose bumps and wear a sweater.",Nikolai
3,Midodrine,Hypotension,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 14, 2019",21,"This medication raised my heart rate and it dropped my blood pressure and landed me in the emergency room for 3 days! I remember taking it and feeling the urge to pee then I have this burning sensation all over my body, then the dry mouth kicked in and the then convulsions and weak legs, then the tachycardia and faint feeling, then the panic set in, and the flushing and burning in my ears, severe pressure in my head, abdominal cramping and finally severe severe dizziness, it was the worse thing I had ever tried...! I was very upset at the way I reacted to it.",Liz
4,Midodrine,Hypotension,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 19, 2018",17,My neurologist put me on this midodrine. I couldn’t stand and walk 5 ft with out going down. I was getting ready to accept life in power chair. I have CIDP (Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy). I have lost 60% of the nerves in my legs due to severe neuropathy. The blood vessels  do not get the signal from my brain to constrict just before I stand up so the blood drains down and I go down.,EDR

7,Midodrine,Hypotension,10,,"July 20, 2011",85,"I have been on this medicine for thirteen years (since age 17) without issue. Taking this medicine enables me to live my life with only the occasional (rather than inevitable) fainting, dizziness and exhaustion. My doctor tried to switch me to lower doses, but my symptoms immediately kick in and make it difficult to function. Regular doses have made all the difference in my life.",Anonymous
8,Midodrine,Hypotension,10,,"August 17, 2010",82,"I am greatly disappointed that they are going to take Midodrine off the market.  I have taken it for about 8 years with fantastic results.  Without it I have syncope often, I am really researching what to do because I rely on this medicine for help with my hypotension.  Tried to go off of it once, passed out in my bosses arms - that was embarrassing - got back on it and not a problem since.  Even on medication my blood pressure runs 100/70....but off of Midodrine I have to work to keep at 88/60, sometimes I am less than that and syncope is definite.   I WISH they would reconsider taking it off the market.",keezheekoni

She was always sitting or lying down.Since this medication was started she has improved alot without experiencing any side effects. Positive result with this medication.
