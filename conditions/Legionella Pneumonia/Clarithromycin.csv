0,Clarithromycin,Legionella Pneumonia,1,,"January 3, 2016",2,"Worst antibiotic I have ever had in my life, was prescribed this along with prednisone. Since day one my heart has been pounding out my chest then going slow , I have had tightness in it, my mouth tastes vile, I  am on day 5 and have been trying to get asleep for 4 hours and I can't because of the palpitations in my heart, the antibiotics have taken the pains out of my chest which is what I was prescribed them for, but now the side effects are worst than the pains in my chest, never ever again!!!",123321123321
