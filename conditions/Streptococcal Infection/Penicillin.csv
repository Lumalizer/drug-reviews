1,Penicillin,Streptococcal Infection,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 25, 2021",0,"Penicillin VK (penicillin v potassium):Worst medication I’ve ever been prescribed. I had strep for the first time in my life over a year ago and I was prescribed this. It interacted with my vitamins.. I felt exhausted all the time. Plus, it didn’t even work. I had strep again days after finishing out my prescription. I was taking it at specific times each day, and taking all the precautions while having strep. I was prescribed this once more and it didn’t work. Finally I was given another antibiotic amoxicillin. Works way better. I’ve heard the same from many friends who also had bad experience with penicillin.",emily
