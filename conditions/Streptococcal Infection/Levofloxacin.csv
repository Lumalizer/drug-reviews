0,Levofloxacin,Streptococcal Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 11, 2020",17,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):I do not recommend this antibiotic, although I did feel better quickly from the infection. My tendons are got inflamed and achy. Especially in the calves of my legs, hips and knee pain.  Do not use unless you have to. But mine was given with steroids.",Nicky
1,Levofloxacin,Streptococcal Infection,9.0,,"July 22, 2019",16,"I had a case of recurring Strep.  I was on Azithromycin twice and it didn't seem to be doing this trick this time around.  My doctor called me and mentioned that Strep A is becoming resistant to Azithromycin and instead put me of a 7 day course of Levofloxacin.I never suffered any side effects, but within two days I was feeling great.  The sore throat and hacking cough went away and I have more energy now.  I am wondering if I had any other infection going on because I not only felt better, my libido returned to what it was 5 years ago.Levofloxacin is a very powerful antibiotic and it certainly does the job, but I can certainly understand the risks and how it may not be right for some people.  That said, while side effects impact in average 1% of the population, that 1% seems to be 50% of people who write reviews, so I think it's important to keep that perspective. Best advice is LISTEN TO YOUR DOCTOR!  If your doctor prescribes it, they probably have a good reason.",DanT
2,Levofloxacin,Streptococcal Infection,1.0,,"December 21, 2018",16,Levaquin (levofloxacin):This medication can cause weakening of tendons. At 43 I had a tear in my left Achilles. My right achilles tore and was repaired at age 49. The surgeon said my tendon was in VERY BAD shape. It didn't make it through the first repair because I fell and it totally ruptured. It took 18 months for full recovery. My recommendation is to STAY AWAY FEOM LEVAQUIN OR ANYTHING IN ITS FAMILY!!!!!,Onlylvonce

5,Levofloxacin,Streptococcal Infection,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 25, 2016",15,"I had meningitis which was the result of an ongoing untreated and lingering sinus infection. I was on IV antibiotics along with oral Levaquin. A month later I took Levaquin for about 3 more weeks for extra measure to clear it all out. This med likely had a part in saving my life, because I'm allergic to alot of other meds and I can tolerate this. The only thing I do/did notice when taking it, is vivid and sometimes intense/strange dreams. It stopped when I was done with the course. Had I taken antibiotics back when my sinus infection started (I didn't as I was scared of unneccessary meds) I wouldn't have gotten meningitis in the first place. So people, please please take the meds if you have an infection. Don't end up like me!",Anonymous

7,Levofloxacin,Streptococcal Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 2, 2016",20,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):I was diagnosed with tonsillitis/strep condition. I was given a prescription of 7 pills. Took my first pill with water at 3:39PM and woke up at 5:30PM with my heart racing at over 120bpm and felt every blood vessel in my body pulsating. This lasted for only about 45 seconds to a minute I think. I was more worried about going into cardiac arrest than timing how long this was going on for. After that read forums on long lasting horrible side effects. No other symptoms till the next day. Woke up with sore knees. Did more ""internet research on this drug and how it should be banned. My toes and heels are tingling, numb and feel like pins/needles and burning. Called my Dr. for a different prescription. Zithromax, which is fine.",TLuggiero
8,Levofloxacin,Streptococcal Infection,1.0,,"June 6, 2015",15,I came up positive on rapid streph test first time taking this medicine 7 day 500 mg.  It's day 1 throat is still swollen and can barely swallow no change yet.  Insomnia I'm so tired and I can't sleep my heart is racing. I hope this doesn't happen to you.,Joey4321
9,Levofloxacin,Streptococcal Infection,10.0,,"December 27, 2013",39,"I usually get strep throat about twice in the winter, first time being on this antibiotic and within hours I noticed the pain dwindling away. Please drink plenty of water as advised. Didnt drink enough water on the second day and had a major headache, dizziness, and nausea, I started pounding waters and it eventually passed. When it kicks in, it did make meNervous but it subsided after about 10 minutes!",Michelle K

11,Levofloxacin,Streptococcal Infection,,,"April 2, 2010",50,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):Not allergic to anything.  On Day 15 round of antibiotics in February so needed something stronger to wipe out this Diphtheria and Strep throat. Could barely swallow yesterday.  Took a pill yesterday, went to bed, woke up with a headache that was manageable along with some dizziness that is getting better. Little bit of pain in joints and some very soft stool this morning but I was thankful for that.  I already can swallow today without much pain and feel about 20% better so it must be working at a fast rate.  I am thankful, Only taking it for 7 days, 500MG",katph062000
12,Levofloxacin,Streptococcal Infection,9.0,,"September 20, 2009",44,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):Had an on again, off again strep virus for the last year.  24 hours later after taking Levaquin and I can tell a difference.  Obviously a powerful medicine.  If you are an experienced sinus/throat person and you've tried all of the over the counter medicine, alternative and weaker antibiotic version give this one a try.  There are risks to taking this medicine.  If you are not to sensitive, do it!  This seems to be the only one with any effect that I tried.",Anonymous
13,Levofloxacin,Streptococcal Infection,8.0,,"September 4, 2009",27,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):Had a secondary staph infection from an athlete's foot problem.  Went to ER, gave me some antibiotics (forgot the name).  Five days passed and no relief; saw a dermatologist and he put me on the Levaquin.  First night was like World War III in my foot.  Almost ran back to the ER, but you could feel this medicine working.  Two days on the pill and swelling and redness subsided significantly.  Third day, I could walk again and zero pain from the infection.  This medicine works. Now, I'll admit that I've had sore Achilles tendons and I could feel the medicine working its way up into my knees.  However, considering the pain I was in, I am okay with the trade off. Very expensive medicine - but works!",Anonymous
14,Levofloxacin,Streptococcal Infection,10.0,,"May 29, 2008",71,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):Few months back I had combined attack of Flu and bad strep throat. Could not eat or speak. 102-103 fever every 5-6 hours. Doctor gave me Zithromax (Azithromycin) 500 mg two times/day. After 4 days fever came under control but blood spots in my coughing would not go away. Finally Doctor gave Levaquin (1 capsule/day). With 1st dose, pain was reduced by 80%. With 2nd dose blood spots were gone, fever gone and no pain. By 3rd dose, I was like nothing happened. Excellent drug. Must finish 10 capsule course.",nirvina787
