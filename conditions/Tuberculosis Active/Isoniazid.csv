It is very difficult time for me, because since the beginning of taking this medication I'm experiencing very strong mood changes, I'm very nervous and anxious. Can't sleep at night. I never read about the anxiety side effects of Isoniazid, but I have one since the start of the treatment. No gastrointestinal side effects though.",Some psych side effects
