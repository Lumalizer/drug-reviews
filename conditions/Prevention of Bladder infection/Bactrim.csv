0,Bactrim,Prevention of Bladder infection,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 4, 2019",9,"In the 1960s and early 1970s, I would get a bladder infection usually the day after intercourse with my husband, who was not circumcised.  We were divorced after thirteen years and I never had another bladder infection. Bactrim was the only drug that worked for me and the doctor gave me a standing prescription during those thirteen years.  I still think it's wonderful !!!",Navillus
1,Bactrim,Prevention of Bladder infection,10,,"July 20, 2011",30,"I used to get chronic bladder infections, especially after intercourse.  It did not matter how clean I thought I was or what I did to prevent them, I would still get them.  I take 1/2 tablet of Bactrim after intercourse, as prescribed by my doctor, and I never get a bladder infection. Yay!",Anonymous
2,Bactrim,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,,"February 8, 2011",23,"I started taking Bactrim on a Tuesday. By Wednesday I was depressed and had terrible knots in my stomach. I was going to bathroom almost every hours and had hives all day and night. Thursday, I felt a lot better and my symptoms were mostly relieved as well. I thought it worth the hives and frequent bathroom breaks. On Friday my lips, gums, tongue and face were all swollen. I didn't think it was the medication at all. Doc's nurse called to tell me that my culture came back and that they are switching my medicine.When I changed the medicine on Saturday I had sores in my mouth along with the swollen gums. I made a dental appointment thinking that it is due to an immunization problem, by Sunday I called my doctor and learnt that I developed allergies.",Anonymous
