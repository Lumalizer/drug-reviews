1,Bactrim DS,Prevention of Bladder infection,3,,"December 31, 2016",8,"I was having symptoms of a UTI for a few weeks, so I finally went to the ER when the pain got worse, they gave me Bactrim. 2 days after taking it (twice a day) I got flu symptoms/ a cold. Today is my 5th day on it and I feel awful, shortness of breath, so so tired and I feel so nauseous. And I'm still having pain when I use the bathroom so I don't even think Its working. Going to call the doctor tomorrow, I won't be continuing this medicine.",Anonymous
