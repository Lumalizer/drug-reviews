We were divorced after thirteen years and I never had another bladder infection. Bactrim was the only drug that worked for me and the doctor gave me a standing prescription during those thirteen years.  I still think it's wonderful !!!",Navillus

5,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Prevention of Bladder infection,,,"May 24, 2015",11,"I almost did not take this drug because of all the negative reviews but I am glad I did.  I am 45 years old and I am African American.  I am in pretty good health.  I recently had a laparascopy by my gynecologist and developed swelling around the navel area.  The doctor prescribed this antibiotic to me.  I always read directions carefully before taking any medication and it says to always take with food.   I took it as prescribed and had no side effects at all!  I actually lost 11 pounds in 10 days!  WOW!  I needed to lose weight anyway I weighed 175 pounds and I am 5'9 now I am down to 164.5 pounds.  My appetite had slightly decreased and it remains decreased since I stopped taking it which is good I use to get the munchies so it did something to my thought process when it comes to food.I encourage people to always research drugs before taking them but do not give a lot of weight on reviews and try the medication.  You never know how it works until you take it and I am glad I did.  It helped me both heal, lose weight and stopped my junk food cravings!  I am happy with results!",Marie20142015

It did not matter how clean I thought I was or what I did to prevent them, I would still get them.  I take 1/2 tablet of Bactrim after intercourse, as prescribed by my doctor, and I never get a bladder infection. Yay!",Anonymous
7,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Prevention of Bladder infection,1.0,,"February 8, 2011",23,"Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim):I started taking Bactrim on a Tuesday. By Wednesday I was depressed and had terrible knots in my stomach. I was going to bathroom almost every hours and had hives all day and night. Thursday, I felt a lot better and my symptoms were mostly relieved as well. I thought it worth the hives and frequent bathroom breaks. On Friday my lips, gums, tongue and face were all swollen. I didn't think it was the medication at all. Doc's nurse called to tell me that my culture came back and that they are switching my medicine.When I changed the medicine on Saturday I had sores in my mouth along with the swollen gums. I made a dental appointment thinking that it is due to an immunization problem, by Sunday I called my doctor and learnt that I developed allergies.",Anonymous
