2,Trimethoprim,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 10, 2019",14,"I’ve suffered from UTI’s and chronic cystitis for about 8 years, and finally I’ve been taken seriously and been given ultrasounds and put on a 3 month course of trimethoprim as a preventative measure to take 200mg at night. 4 days in I became really constipated and got bad headaches. 6 days in I began waking up early in the morning vomiting, and subsequently felt nauseous the whole day and could barely stomach even the tiniest amount of food. Convinced myself I may be pregnant, 2 negative tests later, and after choosing to stop the medication after calling my GP and now I'm 100% fine again, no nausea, headaches or anything. Probably important to note I also got really bad aches and pains in my whole body too. Now been switched on to 50mg of Nitrofurantoin at bed time instead so fingers crossed! ",soffffff
