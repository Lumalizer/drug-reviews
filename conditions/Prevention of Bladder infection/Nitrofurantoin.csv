I’ve been on nitro for a year now, taken every time I have sex (multiple times a week) and haven’t gotten a single UTI. this medication saved me from UTI’s.

I was on home IV antibiotics for four weeks. Nothing worked. Finally identified the bacteria and was put on a black box antibiotic for 11 days. Then switched to Macrobid as a precaution for the next four months while we narrow down what is wrong. This is doing its job well. 2) It has also caused a pain I feel in my head, sinuses, ears, neck and teeth are extreme and life altering. You can’t live a normal life with this type of pain.

I was afraid it damaged my liver due to the itching.  My internist ran a liver panel stat.  Liver function perfect, feel better with the antihistamines and stopped Macrobid.  I am not taking this toxic drug to prevent UTIs, not worth it.  In my opinion, it may be okay for short term use, but not as a preventative.

52,Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 8, 2014",70,"In college I started getting urinary tract infections fairly frequently. Finally, after a handful of UTIs (treated with Cipro-allergic to Sulfa medicines), the doctor referred me to a urologist who placed me on Nitrofurantoin.  I was initially taking it every day, then just after sex or other situations which increased the likelihood of developing a UTI, and eventually I stopped taking it altogether because it had been about 5 years since I had a UTI.  Well, I woke up around 4am today with the all-too-familiar urgent need to pee.  By the time I had finished showering I was fairly certain I was developing a UTI.  I happened to still have some Nitrofurantoin on hand, I took a pill before work and my symptoms were gone in a matter of hours.  No side effects.  Yay!",tw_IL

When discussing this with an Ob/Gyn she decided to prescribe Macrobid to be taken on days of intercourse in order to prevent me from getting another infection. I went from getting an infection every couple of months to not having one for a year and a half, until I ran out of the medication. The only side effect was a change in urine color which did not have an effect on my quality of life beyond wearing panty liners as a precautionary measure on days I had taken it to ensure my underwear did not get stained.
