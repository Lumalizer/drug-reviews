0,Macrobid,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 10, 2021",4,"I took this drug for the first time for 1 day (2 pills).  Heart pounding fast, had the chills, heavy chest, very dizzy and unsteady when standing.  Had to go to bed.  All night had the worst headache I have ever had (haven't had headaches for years).  Body ached, bad stomach ache, fever, had to throw up.  Got no sleep.  Never been sick like that.  Refused to take it the next day (was prescribed 2 pills for 3 days).  Awful drug - Do Not Take.  Have never had a problem with other antibiotics for urinary track infections or prevention of.",b b
1,Macrobid,Prevention of Bladder infection,5,,"February 6, 2021",6,"I had a hysterectomy a few years back when I was 38 I’m 40 now. I noticed a lot changed with my body after the hysterectomy including constant UTI’s after intercourse with my husband. This went on for months. I was on amoxicillin for so long my body is now resistant Urogyno decided to place me on macrobid daily for 3 month at 100mg once a day. I’ve been on it for the past 2 weeks. The good, I think it’s helping with prevention, which we all know having an infection is awful so it does the job. I noticed it has increased my migraines It has caused muscle aches and my stomach feels more gassy and bloated than normal. I do get hot flashes and chills, not developed a fever. My throat is more dry and I have slight cough but I have asthma and it’s winter here. I do feel nauseous  without food. I will try this out for the duration of the 3 months and see if some of the side effects dissipate and make a conclusion on if the pros out way the cons at that time.",Star8089
2,Macrobid,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 11, 2020",31,"I have been taking 100 mg of macrobid at bedtime each night for the past almost 2 weeks to hopefully prevent reoccurring UTI’S.  After a couple days, I developed such a bad cough that I was actually sent for a Covid-19 test, ran low grade fevers, had headaches, no energy at all....could barely move and felt faint and no appetite. Forgot the pill one night and realized, late the following day how great and normal I felt all day, so much energy....actually wanted to and ENJOYED eating.   Took my pill again that night and next day....it was even worse.  Am calling my doctor, I don’t want to feel like I’m literally fading away.",Rhlowe
3,Macrobid,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 26, 2020",90,"Was put on macrobid when my yearly physical lab showed a slightly higher WBC in urine. After 2 doses I began with chills and fever. I had three days of 104 temp, nausea and vomiting even water would not stay down. As a senior adult living alone I feared the need for IV and hospital treatment but would not go due to Covid. Called my Dr back and was told to go get tested for Covid. They offered no other reason for my ills. I did my own research and took myself off of the drug. 24 hours later.. no chills, fever is normal, no vomiting. This was like poisoning my body. Never again! My daughters had similar experiences also. Be aware if taking this drug. I do not think it should be on the market",Truthie
4,Macrobid,Prevention of Bladder infection,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 24, 2020",34,I have been on Macrobid every other day since 1997 and I have not had a bladder infection for 23 years. It was a life saver for me as I would get bladder infections monthly. No ill side effects.,Bastet
5,Macrobid,Prevention of Bladder infection,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 29, 2019",25,"I don’t like that the people that didn’t have a bad reaction are acting that their experience negates all the others. Everybody is different and every body reacts differentlyThe good: in the last several weeks I’ve been hospitalized with kidney infections and sepsis twice. I was on home IV antibiotics for four weeks. Nothing worked. Finally identified the bacteria and was put on a black box antibiotic for 11 days. Then switched to Macrobid as a precaution for the next four months while we narrow down what is wrong. This is doing its job well. 2) It has also caused a pain I feel in my head, sinuses, ears, neck and teeth are extreme and life altering. You can’t live a normal life with this type of pain. It’s a nightmare. The pain is intolerable. If you haven’t experienced this. Be grateful, not angry at those of us suffering.",Jameson
6,Macrobid,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2019",11,"I was prescribed Macrobid 100 mg to take at night was a prophylatic from recurrent UTIs.  I took it nightly for 15 days.  On the 16th day, I had a horrible reaction.  Hives and itching from head to toe.  Went to my internist and was given two antihistamines for 10 days.  I was afraid it damaged my liver due to the itching.  My internist ran a liver panel stat.  Liver function perfect, feel better with the antihistamines and stopped Macrobid.  I am not taking this toxic drug to prevent UTIs, not worth it.  In my opinion, it may be okay for short term use, but not as a preventative.  I am surprised it took almost two weeks for my body to have an allergic reaction.  Strange and scary.",Queenofhearts
7,Macrobid,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 25, 2019",10,"I was prescribed Macrobid for recurrent UTI’s and bladder infections. I’m supposed to be taking one a day for 3 months, then every other day. I’ve been on it about a month now and for the last week I’ve been waking up every day with severe pain in the back of my neck that goes straight up into the middle of my head. And it is very painful. Now I have, out of nowhere, severe dry eyes. Never had that before. It feels like there is dirt in my eyes all the time. The abdominal pains started yesterday. After researching this drug I realize that it’s most likely all from Macrobid. I stopped taking it 2 days ago and I hope it gets out of my system soon.",Kris
8,Macrobid,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,,"September 26, 2018",16,"Just wanted to input to help others if they have any same side effects I had. I got prescribed Macrobid for bladder infection. Took two doses, woke up the next day feeling awful, weird cloudy headache, couldn't think, felt so weak but still took my next dose. Then hour later I started to get very emotional and panicky and all of a sudden started to be sick around 4 times, I couldn't breath properly because I began having a panic attack that sent my pulse to 119, blood pressure was raised and lips and chest were numb, honestly swear to god I was dying. I then called 111 because I was in such a state and they called an ambulance. I was then checked over and given amoxicillin. Will never take again. No wonder it's black and yellow, thats a clear warning. Props to those that could survive it, I clearly am too much of a weakling to handle this insane, wasp looking substance.",Zard
9,Macrobid,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 13, 2018",16,Just because some of you don’t have any reactions to Macrobid doesn't mean the ones that do are lying. It’s real. I have suffered through the effects and it is not pretty. You really feel extremely sick. never again!,Lori
10,Macrobid,Prevention of Bladder infection,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 14, 2017",67,"I have had recurring uti's for 5 decades. I've been on macrobid for a couple of years. I've found it does help prevent the kidney and bladder infections with few side effects. The side effects I do have are: darkened urine, diarrhea occasionally, nausea and dry heaves occassionally, dizziness occasionally and peripheral neuropathy on occasion. Now I know you would think that these side effects would deter someone from taking this drug but for me those side effects are better than having bladder and kidney infections for 6 months at a time. For me the macrobid is the lesser of the two evils. Living with the infections is worse than these few issues.",DebbyGre
11,Macrobid,Prevention of Bladder infection,10,,"November 17, 2016",47,i would experience urinary tract infections multiple times a year due to sexual intercourse. I would always make sure that my partner and I would both wash off before sexual intercourse to cut down on the spreading of bacteria which helped but I still suffered from frequent utis. My doctor then prescribed macrobid. I have had no negative side effects with or without food and I have had ZERO urinary tract infections for the past 9 months. This medicine has really increased my quality of life including my sex life. Definitely recommend!,Anonymous

13,Macrobid,Prevention of Bladder infection,1,,"September 29, 2015",41,"I got prescribed microbid. read all kind of review good and bad ones. Decides to give it a try. Ate like a pig and took the pill. I got so sick. I was light headed (like I consumed all kind of drugs) had sharp pain in my stomach. Got a fever. My back...ohh my back killed me.

16,Macrobid,Prevention of Bladder infection,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 4, 2013",116,"I have had frequently reoccurring urinary tract infections for almost 15 years and tried pretty much every trick out there to prevent them, to no avail. When discussing this with an Ob/Gyn she decided to prescribe Macrobid to be taken on days of intercourse in order to prevent me from getting another infection. I went from getting an infection every couple of months to not having one for a year and a half, until I ran out of the medication. The only side effect was a change in urine color which did not have an effect on my quality of life beyond wearing panty liners as a precautionary measure on days I had taken it to ensure my underwear did not get stained. Taking this to prevent infections was a life changer for me.",AMoonlitStar
17,Macrobid,Prevention of Bladder infection,8,,"April 11, 2012",48,"I was 20 weeks pregnant when I had to go to the hospital because I had a bladder infection and kidney stones. The doctor ordered me to take this twice a day for 7 days and it helped greatly. When I went in two weeks later for a follow up with my ob/gyn he said the infection was gone but just to be safe he put me on this for the rest of my pregnancy to prevent me from getting another infection since I'm predisposed to getting them. After three weeks of taking this once a day I had to take myself off of it. I was nauseous all morning and night, tired to the point of lethargy, and just not feeling well at all in general. As soon as I stopped taking it all the horribleness went away.",Anonymous
