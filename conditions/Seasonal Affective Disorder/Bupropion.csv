0,Bupropion,Seasonal Affective Disorder,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 26, 2022",1,"Wellbutrin XL (bupropion):For the first 5-7 year this Wellbutrin worked 100% for SAD; the only side effect was memory problems but it didn't matter because I was doing so well. I was taking 300mg/day year round. After 6 years or so it started to not work as well. 450mg helped for one winter, but the next winter it only helped for around 2 weeks. I tried going off it one summer (in case I had built up a tolerance) and felt 'blah' all the time, and going back on it it only took that away initially. For the last 2 years or so I felt that blahness while on 300mg/day; a constant low-moderate grade depression/apathy/numbness, and mental emptiness too. It completely stopped working for SAD. I hope others who benefit like I did initially don't experience this too.",Aidan
1,Bupropion,Seasonal Affective Disorder,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 11, 2021",0,"Worst experience of my life. Everyone has different experiences, but I literally had the worst experience when I was on this pill. An article said the side effects would go away after 3 weeks, so I tried to push myself to get past the symptoms, but it was just so terrible that I stopped after two weeks.  My insomnia got worse, I would hear loud ringing sounds so I would have the worst headache when I would try to fall asleep...and I usually don't have headaches. I was very nauseous and lost my appetite to the point I lost 4 pounds in two weeks. I was even more miserable than I already was and super sensitive. I don't know how many times I cried those two weeks I was on the pill.  I did not want to see anyone and just wanted to lay in bed all the time.",lin
2,Bupropion,Seasonal Affective Disorder,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 13, 2021",3,"The first time I took 150 mg XL bupropion, it felt like I had sat in the sun on a windless day for an afternoon. No joke, I felt totally blissed out! It's been about a month and I feel really lucky, after trying probably 4 other antidepressants to help with my SAD, this is the only one I've been on that doesn't feel like it wipes away a part of me or keeps me vibrating; I've never been on one that I didn't think I'd chuck before summer until now. I have ADHD too, but at the rate this has been working for me I'm considering asking for a lower dose of my stimulants because since I've been on this I feel like I might be able to train my brain to focus for the first time in my life. I have a quit day in mind for my vaping too, and am excited to see the difference between 24 hours of withdrawals on vs off this medication. There's no such thing as a miracle drug, but in combination with therapy this has been the closest thing I've ever found to one and I'm incredibly grateful.",odd
3,Bupropion,Seasonal Affective Disorder,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2020",8,"Dreaded the gloomy midwest winters not for the cold or snow but for the lack of sunlight. Impacting me starting 20's and progressively became worse, only remedy was travel. Just miserable. Googled this drug, went to my doctor, she quickly agreed this might work for me.  I'm on day 20 and, wow this stuff bupropion really works for seasonal affective disorder.  I am only taking 100mg and it seems good enough, it started to work on day 2.",SAD Sufferer
4,Bupropion,Seasonal Affective Disorder,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2020",14,This is my first time trying this bupropion for seasonal affective disorder and I'm on the 5th day and have never felt better! I tried lexapro before which made me suicidal (have never felt that way even while being depressed). I would say 9/10!,axo

6,Bupropion,Seasonal Affective Disorder,3,,"February 19, 2020",18,"Wellbutrin XL (bupropion):I started taking Wellbutrin XL on 150 mg and 3 nights ago, I started to severely itch all over my body, starting with the back of my neck. I took a very hot bath to try to relieve the itch but nothing helped at all. The next morning, I tried to think of anything that would have caused this terrible itch. The only medications that I am on are birth control and (was) on Wellbutrin. I decided to look up the side effects of Wellbutrin and one of them was itching. The itching continued throughout the day. The next morning, I broke out in hives ALL OVER my body, mostly on my arms and chest. I had to schedule an emergency appointment with my doctor and had to take a cortisone shot, along with benadryl 6 times a day, put on hydrocortisone 3 times a day, Claritin in the morning, and double dose of Pepcid. This is my second day off of Wellbutrin and Im finally not scratching my skin off. If you know that you are sensitive to medication, I would stay away from this medication.",Anonymous

I have taken Bupropion on, and off. I think I will stick with it this time Adderall is too bad for the heart. I feel more energetic the second day I started 150mg 2x daily. I also have less pacing starts and can multitask without freaking out.",cew

After 4 weeks it started to work.  I would recommend starting take the first week that Daylight saving time ends. November 1 or even before.

9,Bupropion,Seasonal Affective Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 8, 2019",7,I've had SAD since my teens and have tried to escape to the sun every winter which has been really expensive and impractical now that I'm a mum of teens in my early 50s.  I found out about this drug on an SAD website - it's not licensed in the UK but my doctor prescribed it anyway.  it's been brilliant. I have  mild side effects (mainly the constipation) but I feel so much happier than I have in the past.,donska
10,Bupropion,Seasonal Affective Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 17, 2017",26,Beyond grateful for this.  Since about 19 years old I've always become horribly depressed in the fall and winter.  Work performance? Down the toilet.  Relationships?  Down the toilet.Taking this with regular therapy & anti anxiety Rx ( have anxiety too....what fun).  It works FANTASTIC.Work performance is so much better as well my relationships with other people,YankeeFanatic
11,Bupropion,Seasonal Affective Disorder,9,,"January 26, 2017",65,"Wellbutrin XL (bupropion):Seasonal Affective Disorder really hit me hard once I turned 20. I spent 2 winters completely and utterly miserable. I was extremely lethargic, depressed, gaining weight from inactivity, and just all around hopeless. After the second winter going through that hell, I said no more. I began treatment for SAD in the fall, and it has already helped immensely (along with consistent therapy). I have more energy, much less depression and hopelessness, and have not gained any weight at all (which is a big deal for me this time of year). One thing I will say is that an interesting side effect for me has been apathy. I feel a bit numb to emotions. But not depressed - just not as emotional. It has been kind of nice actually.",miaeliz

13,Bupropion,Seasonal Affective Disorder,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 16, 2016",30,It cured my seasonal depression which had lasted from age 21 to age 49.  But it will not work for people who take too low a dosage.  Everyone should work with their doctor to find a dosage level that works and it takes a few weeks at a dosage to determine if that level is or is not effective.   I take 400 per day.,Billspal
14,Bupropion,Seasonal Affective Disorder,10,,"August 18, 2015",53,"My real advice is don't hesitate to see a doc and start medication. I regret not seeking help earlier. Im not the person to take meds-no antibiotics or AdviI. I struggled from the age of 15. I was never motivated to do normal daily things, I couldn't keep up in school, I had panic attacks, I was always more sad and emotional then my friends. I was unmotivated and insecure. I couldn't control my thoughts- sad or paranoid. I consulted with a doc and took Lexapro, I gained weight & the sadness went away, but so did the happiness. I was numb. My doc leaned me off &put me on BupropionXL150mg. Ive been on it since for 3 years straight. Since then I have graduated college, got a full time job, living on my on my own.

For the last 10 years the winter would literally cause me to become a different person. Finally I got the courage to talk to my doctor and was put on Wellbutrin XL in July, well before the winter months. It has truly been a lifesaver. This is the first winter in 10 years where my mood has not changed at all from how I was in the summer months. I would give this medicine 100 stars if I could.",No more SAD

I took this for about two years.  I then went off. I have notice that seasonal issues slowly begin to reappear.
