0,Wellbutrin XL,Seasonal Affective Disorder,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 26, 2022",1,"For the first 5-7 year this Wellbutrin worked 100% for SAD; the only side effect was memory problems but it didn't matter because I was doing so well. I was taking 300mg/day year round. After 6 years or so it started to not work as well. 450mg helped for one winter, but the next winter it only helped for around 2 weeks. I tried going off it one summer (in case I had built up a tolerance) and felt 'blah' all the time, and going back on it it only took that away initially. For the last 2 years or so I felt that blahness while on 300mg/day; a constant low-moderate grade depression/apathy/numbness, and mental emptiness too. It completely stopped working for SAD. I hope others who benefit like I did initially don't experience this too.",Aidan
1,Wellbutrin XL,Seasonal Affective Disorder,3,,"February 19, 2020",18,"I started taking Wellbutrin XL on 150 mg and 3 nights ago, I started to severely itch all over my body, starting with the back of my neck. I took a very hot bath to try to relieve the itch but nothing helped at all. The next morning, I tried to think of anything that would have caused this terrible itch. The only medications that I am on are birth control and (was) on Wellbutrin. I decided to look up the side effects of Wellbutrin and one of them was itching. The itching continued throughout the day. The next morning, I broke out in hives ALL OVER my body, mostly on my arms and chest. I had to schedule an emergency appointment with my doctor and had to take a cortisone shot, along with benadryl 6 times a day, put on hydrocortisone 3 times a day, Claritin in the morning, and double dose of Pepcid. This is my second day off of Wellbutrin and Im finally not scratching my skin off. If you know that you are sensitive to medication, I would stay away from this medication.",Anonymous
2,Wellbutrin XL,Seasonal Affective Disorder,9,,"January 26, 2017",65,"Seasonal Affective Disorder really hit me hard once I turned 20. I spent 2 winters completely and utterly miserable. I was extremely lethargic, depressed, gaining weight from inactivity, and just all around hopeless. After the second winter going through that hell, I said no more. I began treatment for SAD in the fall, and it has already helped immensely (along with consistent therapy). I have more energy, much less depression and hopelessness, and have not gained any weight at all (which is a big deal for me this time of year). One thing I will say is that an interesting side effect for me has been apathy. I feel a bit numb to emotions. But not depressed - just not as emotional. It has been kind of nice actually.",miaeliz
3,Wellbutrin XL,Seasonal Affective Disorder,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 6, 2015",103,"I have been taking Wellbutrin XL for several years for Seasonal Affective Disorder, taking 150 mg once a day to 300 mg once a day, depending on the level of my depression.  Every year, it has helped me.  In the fall, I feel a sadness coming over me, and find myself sleeping more, getting out and doing less.  When I start taking the Wellbutrin, within a week, I am back to my normal self.",Widner r
4,Wellbutrin XL,Seasonal Affective Disorder,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 10, 2013",109,I started taking Wellbutrin because of a Vitamin D deficiency and Seasonal Affective Disorder. It was like night and day. It took about 2-3 weeks but I was no longer having crying sessions or getting angry over nothing. A Vitamin D supplement had side effects so I had to quit taking it. I now take a multiple vitamin.,Valley Lover
