0,Naproxen,Herniated Disk,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 8, 2022",0,I was on naproxen for 11 weeks after damaging my back. From week 5 I complained of stomach issues to my GP and hospital and I was still prescribed. I’ve been off of them now for three weeks and still have issues with my stomach being unable to relax and constantly tense. I would avoid this drug at all costs even if the pain is bad it’s not worth the later upset. I was still in pain throughout and still swollen throughout.,Jim martin
