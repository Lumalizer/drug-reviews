0,Esomeprazole,NSAID-Induced Gastric Ulcer,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 9, 2022",0,"I’m glad to see these reviews I thought I was going insane. I have been taking Esomeprazole for the past 7 days and I have been experiencing weird side effects. My doctor thinks I may have created an ulcer from all the pain relievers from when I had Covid and prescribed me this medication also for all the acid reflex  and it hasn’t been easy. I have been getting a lot of nausea, lack of appetite, really bad back pains, constipation, heart palpitations, fatigue, and even shortness of breath. Sometimes I get a dry mouth and I have to drink tons of fluids and still feel like I’m not drinking enough. I thought it was maybe the ulcer if I even do have one causing all of this, but reading the reviews and putting it all together it seems like it is the medication. I keep feeling really sick right after I take it. I want to stop taking it and try something else but my doctor still hasn’t called me",Star

3,Esomeprazole,NSAID-Induced Gastric Ulcer,10,,"May 20, 2011",27,"Nexium (esomeprazole):It helps so much. Before this, my life was miserable with the morning nausea then vomiting tons of acid straight from the stomach. It is not a way to live. We need to be grateful we have resources such as Nexium and other options to help and to treat these conditions. I know for sure in my case!",GERDGAL
4,Esomeprazole,NSAID-Induced Gastric Ulcer,10,,"September 7, 2009",27,"Nexium (esomeprazole):This medicine works very well for me.  I highly recommend it, as it dramatically reduces the amount of acid in my stomach after a gastric ulcer bleed, which after being repaired, I do NOT want to experience that pain again.",Anonymous
