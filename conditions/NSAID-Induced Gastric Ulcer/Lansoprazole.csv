0,Lansoprazole,NSAID-Induced Gastric Ulcer,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 3, 2021",0,"Absolutely shocking drug. Been on it for 3 years due to long term use of ibuprofen for back spasms. Kept having bouts of diarrhea, then bad constipation, felt nauseous all the time, fatigued like I could just drop to sleep on the spot. Over the last few months it has been building up in my system to severe constipation where I was that bloated I couldn't even let gas out, that nauseous and vomiting that I lost weight and that fatigued it was becoming difficult to remember who I was. 5 visits to A&E with a fully dilated pupil that would not shrink and no Dr there told me it could be a side effect of lanzop. My Mum and myself have ended up working out this tablet has caused everything and was probably causing the same thing to my late Grandad as he was put on this cheaper version from one that was working for him. Diabolical. I am now alert, eyes wide open, feeling like I was to eat, eating full plates of food, and bowels are back to how they used to be! Avoid this drug at all costs!",Lemonbalm
1,Lansoprazole,NSAID-Induced Gastric Ulcer,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 5, 2021",6,"Prevacid (lansoprazole):I started Prevacid because I needed something to coat my stomach while I took NSAIDs for back pain, costochondritis and a slipped rib after I had my daughter (I’m small and she was born big and took a toll on my body - had her when I was 40). It worked for taming the heartburn and indigestion, but caused HORRIBLE constipation. I weaned off it and constipation disappeared and I had normal bowel movements almost immediately. But the acid rebound was AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. I have been taking Pepcid and Tums as needed, but they are very short term solutions. I also have had some weird brain fog/lightheadedness, nausea, headaches, fatigue. I wouldn’t recommend this. It wasn’t worth it in my opinion.",KildareCounty125
