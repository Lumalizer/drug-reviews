0,Votrient,Soft Tissue Sarcoma,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 15, 2020",12,"I'm taking Votrient for over 5 years, it stopped the spread of mets. Just before I started the trial, every scan like mr,ct,pet was showing new mets, I had clinical chemo like doxorubicin, ifosfamidum, and it stopped only for a while. My oncologist was always suggesting me votrient but it’s the 4 th line treatment and expensive for the government(complicated to explain when health care is for free in my country. Anyway for me was the last option. The regional CEO oncologist refused me the treatment. But mine oncologist a research and send me to a capital hospital. So that since 18.9.2015 I’m on Votrient1st Of all I had no side effects, then after half year, I started having nausea, diarrhoea, fatigue.  And of course my skin is as pale and cannot find the lightest foundation tone, and colour my hair and henna brows and lashes....",Kate jot

2,Votrient,Soft Tissue Sarcoma,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 21, 2020",10,"Stage 4 soft tissue sarcoma  I was on 800 mg of Votrient.  After 3 weeks the doctor took it down to 600mg because the side effects were too much for me.  On 600mg they were still bad, but he said he couldn't go lower.  After 3 months the cancer had grown and spread to my spine.  Now I am having radiation on the spine then Chemo,  I was told if I do nothing I have ""weeks to months"" left.  If I do Chemo. ""months to a year""  some choice huh?  I'll try the Chemo, but if the side effects are not worth it, I'll stop",Jeff
3,Votrient,Soft Tissue Sarcoma,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 15, 2020",18,"I was on Votrient for 6 months at 600 mg a day. The diarrhea, fatigue and cramping was so bad that I got off the treatment. While on it, my tumors and nodules were shrinking. I immediately felt better when I got off the treatment so I golfed, rode my bike and had a wonderful summer. After a summer being off Votrient, my doctor talked me in to trying again at a lower dose. I started over at 200 mg for a month and felt good so I increased to 400mg a day. Started to feel fatigue and decided to stay at this dose. Its been 4 months now since I started over and all tumors and nodules have shrunk considerably and uptake on PET scan is wayyy lower. It seems to be working. Thinking now about going back to work if I could just get past the need for afternoon naps.I feel blessed. It could be so much worse. Glad I tried Votrient again at a lower dose.",Me

6,Votrient,Soft Tissue Sarcoma,10.0,,"February 22, 2017",29,My wife has a very aggressive cancer that started in the uterus (removed a 2.5 lb tumor last June) which had metastasized to the lung and elsewhere. She was stage 4 at diagnosis. Two chemo drugs did not work. After a bad spell at Christmas (including kidney failure) they were talking about hospice but also wanted to try votrient. The votrient resulted in visible tumor shrinkage within 24 hours. We have continued with the votrient and after six weeks the lung tumors shrank by 20 and 30 per cent. The doctor tells us we may get one more good scan and then it may stop working. But the reprieve has been sweet and things are going in the right direction. She takes 3 pills (600mg) not 4. About the fatigue: she gets some low dose Ritalin.,votrient for leiomyosarcoma

The worst side effect was the tumor pain, which was in my chest/back. Also some fatigue, loss of appetite and diarrhea. 3 months later (now), I feel well and there has been some slight shrinkage of my tumors. I'm also back in the gym. White hair kicked in within the first month. I'm a 22 year old covered in white hair lol",X_Cooley

12,Votrient,Soft Tissue Sarcoma,,,"July 18, 2015",20,"Hello Group, I just started Votrient 3 days ago, I have no side effects at all. I've felt great the past several days, just like my old self before I was diagnosed with a 11.2 cm tumor in my pelvis that was surgically removed in Feb of 2015. However the leiomyosarcoma mets to my liver, lung and I was told bones. After 6 treatments of Gemszar and taxatere the liver and lung mets spread and grew. I was sent to another hospital for Phase II trial trial drug to build the immune system charging the T-cells to go after the caner, while Dixol chemo attack the cancer. The Dixol could only be used 10 due to possible problems with heart pump. I said no thanks, thats when I asked what else they had so I was put on Votrient.",Tiny Dancer
13,Votrient,Soft Tissue Sarcoma,9.0,,"February 19, 2015",99,I was diagnosed with 4 baseball sarcoma tumers in my liver July 15 2014. Did 6 weeks of GEMS/Taxol and after the scan showed two more tumors in the liver and four now in my lungs. My doctor put me on Votrent and scanned me once again after six weeks.

14,Votrient,Soft Tissue Sarcoma,6.0,,"November 17, 2014",44,"Wife is on this now for her 4th week  (800mg ) she has Soft tissue in Right Lung after mets from uterus. Leiomyosarcoma. (sp)  A month ago she was coughing   every 2 minutes, now not so much but she is tired has nausea and the headaches.  No appetite and when she ate solid food it would always come back up.  Now  her food consists of  4- 6 smoothies a day.  Got a Vitamix  after  many  recommended  it  on other websites on the internet.  You fellow patient who have gone before her and have reported  your experiences are the ""only"" thing that have kept her pressing forward.  She has large tumor in chest and it is hope that this will hollow it out or something. Her first Chemo GEMS/Taxol only worked for 3 months . Then it started regrowing",elwood11
15,Votrient,Soft Tissue Sarcoma,10.0,,"September 26, 2014",80,"I was diagnosed with stage 4 Leiomyosarcoma 7/16/2013. Tumors in my stomach, liver, and a few affected lymph nodes. Had surgery and removed 40% of my stomach on 8/30/13. Surgery was a success. I Underwent 4 1/2 months of chemo with minimal shrinkage to existing tumors but did stunt the growth of the tumors. At that point my tumors were considered inoperable. Started Votrient  2/14, just found out my tumors have shrunk enough on my liver to be operable. Liver Surgery scheduled 10/14. So happy, praying Votrient is our miracle. Good luck to others with my condition.",Faith8/26

17,Votrient,Soft Tissue Sarcoma,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 24, 2013",84,"I am currently battling mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. It originated in my right thigh 2008, had the tumor removed, was cancer free for 3 years then was diagnosed last year with it again, with 5 tumors this time which had spread in my pelvic area, right lung and right armpit (July 2012). I've tried a few chemo therapy treatments and during that time frame, the tumors grew plus one new one appeared. In August 2012 I was placed on Votrient (800 mg), the tumors stopped growing and have been stable ever since. My last scan was June 11, 2013 and all 6 tumors are still holding stable and have shown some shrinkage. The side effects come and go, I am experiencing more muscle pain throughout my body and still some nausea, but that's easily controlled.",Mrs. DeRosa
18,Votrient,Soft Tissue Sarcoma,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 17, 2013",72,"I have started taking Votrient about three weeks ago. One tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon, and one tablet before bedtime. I would be sick during the day (nausea, extreme fatigue, and no appetite.) I told my doctor about my experience and she suggested to take the tablets all at once before going to bed. I have been doing this for a week, and it is not too bad except waking up in the morning feel exhausted. But in the afternoon I would feel fine. I think the medication is working because I always have tumor pain and I will be going to the doctor this week for signs of some shrinkage.",Bella Rock
19,Votrient,Soft Tissue Sarcoma,9.0,,"February 22, 2013",63,Started taking Votrient 800 mg last year after 23 days had to stop due to high blood pressure and got a fistula. 3 months later started back on at 400 mg. Seems to be doing better and taking 2 blood pressure medications to control it. Normal side effects like the ones I read about in this site. Last CT no major growths of my Sarcomas.,Keyman
20,Votrient,Soft Tissue Sarcoma,10.0,,"January 24, 2013",60,I started taking it about 6 weeks ago for sarcoma.  The only trouble I have had with it has been some gastro discomfort.  But I was taking it first thing in the morning on a totally empty stomach.  Now I eat breakfast and take it two hours later.  Then eat some yogurt an hour later and so far all the stomach pain is gone.  I do have some food allergies and a slight case of irritable bowel syndrome so I was not really surprised when I had the stomach pain.I have a CT 2/13/13 to see if the tumors are continuing to stay shrunk.  But I feel fine.,Connielee6
