0,Zofran,Gastroenteritis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 12, 2021",0,"I got prescribed zofran as needed for Nausea. I got diagnosed with GERD/GI problems and reflux which is causing all of the nausea. My PC recommended zofran to help nausea and to be honest, this does not help at all with the nausea and queasy feeling. Zofran also has serious side effects and I have noticed that I get very dizzy and lightheaded a short time after taking the medication. I was out to dinner once and took zofran before dinner because I felt awful. That was not a smart idea because I thought I was going to pass out at dinner since the side effects are so extreme. Do not take this medication long term unless you have a reason to because the side effects are kind of dangerous even if used for a short period of time. Be very careful when taking this medication. I stopped taking it because of the severe side effects and the fact that it was not helping my symptoms..",Anonymous
1,Zofran,Gastroenteritis,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 20, 2021",1,I’m inpatient for severe nausea and have been given Zofran but I just read the info on this med and the action and side effects are almost what I’m trying to overcome. It was a blessing because it works really well I think it was IV  but it may be making me confused dizzy vision blurring maybe jaundice I’m not going to take it any more,Sarah
2,Zofran,Gastroenteritis,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 24, 2020",27,I have been on Zofran for 8 years and it has been a lifesaver. I wake up nauseous every single day and the Zofran works within a half hour and I rarely need a repeat dose. I don't know what I would do without it!,D

4,Zofran,Gastroenteritis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 29, 2019",32,"Had gastroenteritis, couldn't stop vomiting. Called doctors on call, they came out at 2am and gave me a shot of maxolon (which worked in the past). Was good for about an hour and then it started again, every half hour until I felt like I was going to pass out. Went to the hospital, they gave me a Zofran wafer and I stopped throwing up within 10 minutes. Felt terrible from dehydration but the Zofran wafer stopped the vomiting in its tracks.I now keep Zofran wafers at home, let myself throw up 2-3 times when I get a stomach bug and then pop a Zofran wafer to stop it. Best thing ever.",Troy
5,Zofran,Gastroenteritis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 22, 2019",50,"Gastroenteritis is horrible.  I started feeling sick and gassy on the first day.  On the second day I thought I was dying.  The pain and burning was so bad it made my chest hurt and I thought I was having a heart attack or anxiety attack.  Went to the doctor, was prescribed Zofran, almost took the sickness away completely!  Still some burning in the lower abdomen, but finally some relief!!!",Tiredofthisbug
6,Zofran,Gastroenteritis,10.0,,"June 21, 2019",69,Salute to the inventor of this medicine Ondansetron . I have IBS-D and with severe flatulance discomfort and suffocating feeling. After taking the mouth dissolving tablet it acts like miracle. At first all the entrapped gas in abdomen comes out in the form of belching and burping and thereafter the normalcy comes to the body and mind. All other medicines have not worked . This is great.  ,P.J Sharma

10,Zofran,Gastroenteritis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 16, 2018",17,I'm unsure with this one. Yes it helps the nausea a little but I was admitted to hospital for acute gastro - had two IV lots of this and Maxalon - lots of IV fluids - and vomited on my way out of hospital - and every 30 minutes all night following.When I've been in hospital and had this drug for HG (severe morning sickness) it did work and I was asking for water and food within half an hour.I've just taken a 4mg dissolvable and am on day 2 of the dreaded bug. Keep your fingers crossed for me xoxo,Sickasadog
11,Zofran,Gastroenteritis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 23, 2018",21,"I’ve been sick with the stomach flu since last night. Ate dinner, then a couple of hours later was in the bathroom throwing up with major diarrhea. Stayed on the toilet literally all night. It was one of those one little move and you feel like you’re going to throw up times. Well, once morning came the puking stopped, but I was still really nauseous with dry heaves. So I called my doctor to see if there was anything I could take, and they recommended Zofran. Wow is this a miracle drug! My nausea was gone within 10-15 minutes of taking it, and I was even able to hold down a couple of popsicles and water with it, until about an hour and a half ago when I started feeling nauseous again (the meds were wearing off, so I took another one, and within 10 minuets my nausea was gone! I even ate another popsicle and downed a little juice glass of water and didn’t throw up! If this little white, grape flavored pill isn’t magic, then I don’t know what is!",Grobanite Clunatic
12,Zofran,Gastroenteritis,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 22, 2018",86,God bless the manufacturers of Zofran!  I am phobic about vomiting - panic attacks just thinking about it.

It’s very useful but every now and then if I feel extremely nauseous it doesn’t help much.",Makayla Skylar
14,Zofran,Gastroenteritis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 28, 2017",37,"I can say I use to be a jealous husband because when our daughter gets the stomach bug I sometimes got it. There is a 50/50 chance I would get it and my wife NEVER gets it.  When I found out about zofran it saved my life.  I'm already a hypochondriac when it comes to the stomach bug, I hate it because as a child of the 90's there was no such pill and I always got the dirty bug. Now I take zofran when my daughter throws up or someone touches me with it just incase so I don't throw up and it always works because I stay upset stomach free. Just boggles my mind why docs never give it to patients, someone told me about it that's how I knew about it.",Bugsy67311
15,Zofran,Gastroenteritis,9.0,,"July 8, 2017",30,"22 Years on mass amounts of steroids to treat my Addison's...22 years of vomiting most days. Many hospital stays. Severe gastroenteritis.

So many times zofran came in for the save. Saved my spouse, I and our 7 and 5 year old a trip to ER when the norovirus hit us. Took it after terrible dry heaves and within 20 minutes I was able to sleep. This medicine also helped after my csection when I was nauseous. When my son had hand foot and mouth and was uncontrollably vomiting the dr gave him this medicine too, within an hour he was eating fine! This was also great for my IBS symptoms when they hit hard.10/10 !!!",Arita44
17,Zofran,Gastroenteritis,10.0,,"January 22, 2017",36,I woke up at 5am with a terrible stomach virus....I swear I thought I was dying. It was coming out both ends and I was in terrible pain from the cramping. I had to lay in the floor by the toilet because I didn't have time to make it from the bed when the cramping hit me...I happened to remember that I had ondansetron(zofran) in the medicine cabinet and my wife gave me one 8mg tablet sublingual. I was better in fifteen minutes. Miracle drug!,Eddie N. Georgia

22,Zofran,Gastroenteritis,10.0,,"June 25, 2016",25,"Spent a week vomiting and with diarrhea. Couldn't keep anything down and was getting worse instead of better. I ended up driving to the ER with a vomit bag to my face trying not to crap myself. When they gave me the Zofran, I felt better in 5 minutes and was able to eat a little plain chicken and rice with broth a couple hours later. I didn't realize just much nausea I had until the whole room suddenly stopped waving. Slept better than I have in a long time and this morning I didn't throw up! Crackers and Gatorade for breakfast! Every 6 hours and I love this little pill.",Vomitbag

Felt so much better within 30 minutes I started eating the first thing I saw.  Second time I used it to bypass the stomach flu that everyone was catching.  I took it within 2 hours of symptoms; I fell asleep shaking, heart racing, with a fever and cold sweat, clutching a bucket to throw up in.
