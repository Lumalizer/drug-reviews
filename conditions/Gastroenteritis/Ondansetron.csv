1,Ondansetron,Gastroenteritis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 12, 2021",0,"Zofran (ondansetron):I got prescribed zofran as needed for Nausea. I got diagnosed with GERD/GI problems and reflux which is causing all of the nausea. My PC recommended zofran to help nausea and to be honest, this does not help at all with the nausea and queasy feeling. Zofran also has serious side effects and I have noticed that I get very dizzy and lightheaded a short time after taking the medication. I was out to dinner once and took zofran before dinner because I felt awful. That was not a smart idea because I thought I was going to pass out at dinner since the side effects are so extreme. Do not take this medication long term unless you have a reason to because the side effects are kind of dangerous even if used for a short period of time. Be very careful when taking this medication. I stopped taking it because of the severe side effects and the fact that it was not helping my symptoms..",Anonymous

I have IBS-D and with severe flatulance discomfort and suffocating feeling. After taking the mouth dissolving tablet it acts like miracle.

So I called my doctor to see if there was anything I could take, and they recommended Zofran. Wow is this a miracle drug! My nausea was gone within 10-15 minutes of taking it, and I was even able to hold down a couple of popsicles and water with it, until about an hour and a half ago when I started feeling nauseous again (the meds were wearing off, so I took another one, and within 10 minuets my nausea was gone!

I'm already a hypochondriac when it comes to the stomach bug, I hate it because as a child of the 90's there was no such pill and I always got the dirty bug. Now I take zofran when my daughter throws up or someone touches me with it just incase so I don't throw up and it always works because I stay upset stomach free.
