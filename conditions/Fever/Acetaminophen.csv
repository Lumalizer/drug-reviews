0,Acetaminophen,Fever,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 1, 2022",1,"Tylenol (acetaminophen):This is great. I've had a small pain in my head when I woke up this morning and decided to ignore it. It started getting worse and I realized I was developing a fever around 5:00PM. Even though I had the help of my younger sister to try and reduce the fever and headache, it just hasn't gone away entirely. I was unable to figure out a way to reduce the pain I was in so I called my mother and told her the pain I was in. Conveniently enough, my mother mentioned that we did have Tylenol at home. I went to the room that she told me I'd find it in. I found the Tylenol and downed a pill with water. In just a minute or two, the pain has basically completely vanished and my fever has been reduced greatly.",1x5

8,Acetaminophen,Fever,9,,"November 3, 2009",10,My son has had a lo-grade fever for three days. I've had him on Tylenol every 4 hours but decided to try Motrin instead during his regular dosing schedule. It didn't do a thing. His fever kept rising.
