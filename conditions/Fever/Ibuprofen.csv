2,Ibuprofen,Fever,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2013",11,"My son is sick with Influenza B. Last night his fever skyrocketed above 104, he vomited, wouldn't move, eat, or talk, I was terrified. I called the doctor and he recommended Children's Ibuprofen. Within an hour of taking it he was asleep, I give it every 6 hours and today he is 100 percent better, playing and even eating. I can't believe how well it works!",KalesMommy
3,Ibuprofen,Fever,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 25, 2013",4,"Children's Motrin (ibuprofen):I purchased this medicine for my little girl because it was doctor recommended. It was a need base purchase to reduce her fever and some of the discomfort that she was having. They stated that it would be the best in reducing her fever. I purchased the medicine and shortly after her fever was gone and she was resting. She slept well through the night. Children%u2019s Motrin is a name that I trust. Therefore, I was not hesitant at all when my doctor recommended that I purchase this product. I have also used other fever reducer products for my little one, such as Tylenol and it did not reduce her fever at all, so Motrin was the choice brand. Motrin allowed her to sleep through the night and she did not spike a fever the next day. Motrin did the job.",Elisha L
4,Ibuprofen,Fever,9,,"May 9, 2008",44,Advil (ibuprofen):Works great to reduce fever. For pains caused by fever I recommend taking 400mg of Ibuprofen (Advil) with 1000mg of Acetaminophen (Tylenol.)  The two work well with each other and are safe to use together.,smoore002
