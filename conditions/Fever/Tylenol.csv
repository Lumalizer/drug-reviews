0,Tylenol,Fever,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 1, 2022",1,"This is great. I've had a small pain in my head when I woke up this morning and decided to ignore it. It started getting worse and I realized I was developing a fever around 5:00PM. Even though I had the help of my younger sister to try and reduce the fever and headache, it just hasn't gone away entirely. I was unable to figure out a way to reduce the pain I was in so I called my mother and told her the pain I was in. Conveniently enough, my mother mentioned that we did have Tylenol at home. I went to the room that she told me I'd find it in. I found the Tylenol and downed a pill with water. In just a minute or two, the pain has basically completely vanished and my fever has been reduced greatly.",1x5

2,Tylenol,Fever,5,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 3, 2020",10,"Great if you have a fever. But if you need pain relief, This won't help. I found It does work better if you have a cup of coffee with it, Otherwise see your doctor for real pain relief. Never take more than the recommended dosage. It can destroy your liver.",Craig
