0,Glycopyrrolate,Excessive Salivation,,,"January 8, 2022",0,I am looking for something to reduce the amount of spit I produce. I was put in the hospital two years ago for about a week or so. Then all of sudden I became non responsive and they had to put a tube down my throat. I am trying to avoid that situation again. Any info would be greatly appreciated.,John

I am a nurse, but I work in a lab drawing blood and I would have sweat just running off of me and one day a drop of sweat fell off of nose and onto the patient's arm and I said this is it!! No more!! Like I said, it's wonderful!  Little dry mouth at times but it's better than a wet head and face!!",jonie
3,Glycopyrrolate,Excessive Salivation,,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 1, 2019",11,"Cuvposa (glycopyrrolate):My daughter took  Cuvposa and she had vomiting, very runny nose, cough, congestion the same day she took it so I stopped it after 2 days. I waited 2-3 weeks and tried to start it again and the same thing happened, very runny nose and she cannot clean or wipe her own nose so it very easily can go into her mouth. I stopped giving it to her a 2nd time, don't think I'll give it to her anymore",Anonymous
