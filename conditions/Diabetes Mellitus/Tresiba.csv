0,Tresiba,Diabetes Mellitus,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2019",17,"I have diabetes mellitus, I was originally diagnosed in 2017 with type 2 and immediately put on metformin and trulicity (A1c 13, avg. glucose 300-400).  I got really ill,  went to the Dr and discovered I was going into DKA (Diabetic ketoacidosis). Dr immediately started me on this and within a few days my numbers dropped!! I have never been in the low 100's in years, and now I am. First few days was an adjustment but I'm finally stabilizing. I had to learn to eat correctly and drink lots of water all day. I only take 16 units at night and metformin (ER 500mg 4x day). I stay around 50 carbs a day total, and small healthy snacks throughout the day. This is a basal based insulin which I think my body is reacting to much better than the other. It has had a huge impact on my numbers in such a short amount of time, unlike 2 years on trulicity which could only get my numbers down to the 200's. For me this is a great insulin.",Jennbugged
1,Tresiba,Diabetes Mellitus,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 17, 2019",14,"My blood glucose had been hard to control for the last 6 months. Then my endo put me on Tresiba, wow the results are amazing. I am mostly in the 100's now before I was up in the 300's. I was a bit afraid to start it but it was so worth it to have blood glucose under control.",Seren
2,Tresiba,Diabetes Mellitus,6,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 3, 2018",4,"Was on Tresiba in the morning only about a year with great results.  For the last couple of months I have elevated glucose levels at night with fasting highs.  I have had diabetes 53 years so I am not a newbie!  My doctor moved me back to levemir in the evening and it is causing nighttime lows and, daytime highs.  I am considering going back to Tresiba and splitting my dose to twice a day which he did not suggest so this is just my idea.  It is a once daily, 24 hour dose. Anyone have any comments about trying this?",Rooster
