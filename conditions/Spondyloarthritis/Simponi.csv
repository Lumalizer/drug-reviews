1,Simponi,Spondyloarthritis,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 30, 2015",10,"Been on this for 2 and a half months. After the second injection, I went 13 days without taking any Norco or Soma whereas I typically took one a day and two a day respectively. It took a bit to get my insurance to cover it, but I had a severe reaction to Humira allowing me to. Amazingly it seems to work even better than my enbrel at 11 weeks.",gmoro0002
