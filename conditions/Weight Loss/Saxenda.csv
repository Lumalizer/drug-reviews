1,Saxenda,Weight Loss,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 24, 2022",1,I'm a 43 year old woman 5'6 . Originally I weighed 210 pounds. I started Saxenda 30 days ago.  I now weigh 193 pounds. I am currently injecting 1.8 and still have 10 days left on that dose.  Not much side effects just a little nausea.  I did get diarrhea a few times after I consumed carbohydrates. I have no appetite and never thirsty so I need to remind myself to hydrate. A few times I didn't hydrate enough which led to constipation.  I also try and walk 3k every evening. Getting my 10000 step in a day. It is definitely working me.,Maureen1979
2,Saxenda,Weight Loss,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 15, 2022",4,"I am a 54-year-old female that was diagnosed with pre-diabetes, high cholesterol and my blood pressure was starting to climb also. I gained a lot of weight after menopause and even more during Covid. My self-esteem was low and I was very frustrated with myself. My doctor started me on Saxenda. And what a blessing it has been. I am in my fifth week right now and have lost 11 pounds so far! My biggest side effects are constipation and occasional dizziness. Other than that, I feel great. I am on 1.2 mg still & my appetite has decreased dramatically! I can still enjoy a little chocolate and an occasional glass of wine! I’m very pleased with the results so far and wish to lose another 20 pounds.  I will then have my blood work repeated to see if my A-1 C and my cholesterol are starting to drop!! Fingers crossed!",Petunia

4,Saxenda,Weight Loss,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 11, 2022",3,"By far the worst experience I have ever had with a medication. I was only on 0.6 for 2 days and I was completely unable to keep anything down, including water! I was the most unwell I have ever been in my life. I couldn’t stand up without being sick, I got so severely dehydrated from my body not being able to keep down the water. Now I have pulled muscles in my chest and back from all the retching. No amount of weight loss could possibly make me want to endure this torture. I’ve now missed doses but where my body has been so unwell I am still unable to eat and drink properly. I really would start this medication with caution as I read all the success stories, I feel I went into it with high expectations but in reality I just spent a lot of money to be very ill and I wouldn’t want others to do the same.",Casey

I started at over 70kg (about 155lb) & have lost 11kg (25lb). My healthy weight is below 56kg & today I weighed 59kg.  Between COVID isolations & a dislocated toe I haven’t been very active.I suffer from IBS & GERD so was worried  about side effects - they weren’t terrible.  2 days after going up a dose I’d have symptoms ranging from bowel cramps, constipation & nausea but it would settle within a week.  When I went up to full dose I was fine for 2 weeks and then the nausea hit bad for a day.  Since then I’ve had no side effects.  My appetite’s definitely decreased.  I intermittent fast (16:8) & it’s been easy on Saxenda.My 20 yr old daughter has insulin resistant PCOS.  She started on it 2 months ago combined with Metformin.  She’s very active & has lost 7kg so far.  On Metformin alone her weight didn’t budge.  She now weighs 56kg & has reduced PCOS symptoms.  We’re 5’1 tall",Shrinking Viole

8,Saxenda,Weight Loss,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 20, 2022",1,Started on the 0.6 with no side effects. Lost 4 kilos in a week. Definitely no desire to eat. Made sure I drank lots of water. Increased my dose to 1.2 and by the next day I had the most severe diarrhoea I have ever had. I couldn’t go to work for 4 days. I have needed to stop my dosage just so I can get back to work but plan on going back on the lowest dosage tomorrow. I am hoping I can stay on this lowest dose and still loose weight. I have lost 6 kilos in 2 weeks and I intend to continue. Would love to hear back from anyone that has stayed on lowest dose and still continued to loose the weight.,CEK
9,Saxenda,Weight Loss,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 30, 2021",3,I started at 116kgs and I have been using this drug for 2 months - down to 105kgs.  What a game changer - whilst I am not really on a diet - I eat what I feel like - but way less food than normal.I didn't realise that my feeling full meter was broken and I would just continuously eat.   Anyway apart for the odd tummy grumble no real side effects. Of yeah do not take magnesium laxatives - the effects of that can last a day and a half ... pen dosage I settled at 2.4 but can reduce that to 1.8 to make the script last longer - it is expensive.,Brita

11,Saxenda,Weight Loss,9.0,,"December 9, 2021",6,"Saxenda does work if you like to binge eat or just cant stop eating, but please be prepared for side effects.. Just because you can eventually end up taking 3.0ml does mean you have to. Find your sweet spot I stuck to 1.2 after finding any more then that was to strong of sidea effects.. Before your first injection make sure you have your fiber and constipation supplements on hand and take daily trust me..If you up the dose and the migraine comes with it have your nurofen plus ready and lower your dose again.This medicine works well if you introduce mild exercise or gym workouts. Good luck",adam

14,Saxenda,Weight Loss,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 10, 2021",1,"I am very happy overall with my decision to take Saxenda. I just wish I had found it sooner. Over 6 months at average 2.4mg, I lost 15kg (33 pounds). I was 100kg and now 85kg. Based in Europe. Side effects minimal, but did increase over 2.4mg. Appetite was best suppressed in fasted state and weight loss was most, I combined with intermittent fasting, and taking Saxenda 1 hour before felt hungry. Increased my fasting from 9pm to 4pm next day. Could lose 1 kg a week.I stopped after 6 months as I got the side effect of constipation. I'm not sure if others have this?

I started Saxenda a week ago and I can't believe how quickly the weight is coming off. Today is day 8 and I am down 7 lbs (almost a pound a day). The first few days my stomach was upset but it went away.  I also have heartburn, but tums help. I was on .06mg for 7 days and I just started 1.2mg. I will keep increasing every 7 days until I'm at 3mg. I do a high intensity workout twice a week and restrict my calorie intake to 1700 a day. I notice I am not as hungry as I use to be.

Which is just insane as I’ve eaten what I want to and just walking for exercise. I have been lucky and not been super sick, just a bit queasy at times. It’s more that it just doesn’t make me want big portions, snacking, candy and to eat bad things. Worth noting I also stopped drinking in October. But when I finally did I barely could or wanted to. It has a been a miracle for me! It is like what I’d imagine gastric to be in a shot.",bettybee

20,Saxenda,Weight Loss,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 29, 2021",1,I think the way it works is you feel too sick to eat. Nonstop nausea and indigestion no matter what time of day I take it. I have lost about 12 lbs in 40 days because I can’t eat. Some days I take a break just so I can enjoy a day without feeling ill.,Ewc313

My insurance no longer covers it so I’m out. I have a fatty atrophy pancreas and I had black floaters in one eye that wouldn’t go away but they’re gone now since stopping this drug 6 weeks ago. The food cravings are coming back so have to stick with portion control. This med helped at first but it does cause issues with the pancreas?! Not completely sure that was the only cause. I drink tons of water now and 6 small portions a day. Oatmeal breakfast, sandwich lunch, reasonable lunch plate of food supper and yogurt in between meals and fruit. Small bowl cereal at night sometimes. I was tired of throwing up and being constipated on this med. It still was painful as a stomach injection at times as well like it burned.

49,Saxenda,Weight Loss,1.0,,"July 18, 2021",4,"Diet drug Saxenda may increase pancreatic cancer risks for patients only wanting weight loss Saxenda dose contains twice as much Liraglutide as diabetes medicine Victoza which is also linked to malignancy in pancreas (DrugInjuryWatch.com) In 2014, the FDA approved Saxenda (liraglutide) for the treatment of obesity. Novo Nordisk is the responsible pharmaceutical company. More generally, Saxenda is in the incretin mimetic class of drugs. Four years earlier, the FDA approved another liraglutide-containing medicine, Victoza, which is a popular Type-2 diabetes drug. Like Victoza, Saxenda has been associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, or pancreas cancer, in patients using this still relatively new obesity, or weight-loss, drug.However, the alarming difference between Saxenda and Victoza is that the standard dose of Saxenda for obesity can be up to 3.0 mg of liraglutide, while the standard doses of Victoza for diabetes are 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg of liraglutide.",Amanda

55,Saxenda,Weight Loss,10.0,,"July 6, 2021",5,"I’ve used saxenda over a period of 2 years. I lost 20% of my weight the 1st year. When on it, I feel super full - like as if I’ve emptied a carton of chocolates and 10 buckets of ice cream full. And that is actually what I personally need to be to not be interested in food. - To feel absolutely stuffed. - Saxenda does that. Beware though of the injections as I got a lot of hard areas with scar tissue. So I stopped taking it for 3 months, and the scar areas disappeared. I’ve now been on it 2 years on and off. You do need to take a 3 month break now and then, because it does stop working. But: I will say this. When I was on it but did not lose weight, I still maintained weight and did not gain weight. But when I stopped - I gained 7 kgs. So now after a long break whilst gaining weight I am back on it again, whilst also trying to eat healthy and workout. I give it a 10. I had been overweight for so long. This was the only thing that worked for me. Fantastic product.",Ida J

Which lasted THREE days. On my dr.'s recommendation, I dropped down to the next threshold. Two days of break from the med & the diarrhea (with the aid of a LOT anti-diarrheal meds) eased a bit. Upon  restarting the med (two nights), it came back with a vengeance--worse than ever. Plus, terrible fatigue that caused me to take TWO days off of work (and I couldn't be away from the bathroom).

Started out with the belching. Sounded like an old drunk. Then the bloat began. My stomach looked & felt like I swallowed a hot air balloon. Next the diarrhea, nothing but pure liquid. At this point, I was a little concerned of becoming dehydrated. Finally, the vomiting, the violent, whatever you ate was coming out of your nose kind of vomiting.I  was like, ""There is no way a medicine could make a person feel this bad!"" But, it can,and did! However, I still feel this could be a good weight lose solution, esp since I have high BP & this doesn't have stimulants & is ""safer"". Reading over other reviews, some people are having great luck w it. My doctor called me in Zofran & I'm only going to do 0.3 every other day to see if my body adjust. If I don't see an improvement in 2 weeks, I will just accept this is not a medication for me & go another route.",Exorcist Experiment

Overweight as a child, dieting most of my life since the age of 12, and normal weight between teenage years and after third child. After fourth child extreme problems to loose weight, and even worse after menopause, and also gaining weight continuously despite a controlled intake. Been in therapy to learn how to eat normally after years of yo-yo dieting. Still unable to loose weight. I started Saxenda on Sunday March 7, dosage 0,6 mg. Felt some very slight nausea and headache the day after. Thereafter absolutely nothing and I still have cravings, still the same appetite. I understand it will take some time but is there a correlation between side effects and weight loss? I hope I finally can expect some appetite control and weight loss in a while.

My endocrinologist put me on Saxenda.  The weight started falling off after about 2 months - and by December I had lost 17kg!  I never went above 2.4mg.  Each time I increased the dose I felt a bit nauseous for a couple of days - like mild morning sickness.  I truly ate whatever I wanted  - but the fact was I didn't WANT anything.  I had half size portions at family meals, the thought of fried, fatty or sugary food made me feel gross, and I even cut down to almost no alcohol.  The biggest challenge was constipation initially.  Laxatives didn't work but the cereal ""All Bran"" turned out to be the solution.  I stopped Saxenda in Jan 2020 and didn't gain any weight back for 4 months.  After being 10 months at home during COVID eating comfort food I did gain 8kg and am back on Saxenda now - this time I will keep the weight off.  For me Saxenda was life changing.",Kelly

If you continue to eat junk food and carbs, you will never lose weight. It is important to maintain a healthy meal plan and Saxenda will help with the cravings and assist in not overeating. It is also important to exercise as well. I found constipation to be an issue, but using Metamucil or a stool softener (not a laxative - as your body can become dependent upon laxatives), probiotic, and insoluable fibrous vegetables such as spinach, broccoli, carrots, tomatoes and celery can help with this. I also experienced some nausea at first, but this too will pass as your body becomes accustomed to the medication. Saxenda has been a wonderful life changing tool for me.",Shasta

Initially lost weight pretty quickly- 35 pounds the first 6 months. After that, I’ve found that it’s less effective and I’ve gained back almost 10 pounds. Like many medications, it seems to stop working after your body builds up a tolerance. I’m at max dose so there’s no increasing it, not to mention the cost of doing that for some people, even if it was an option. So if you’re looking for a jump start or short term weight loss, it definitely works. But you still need to make healthier food and activity choices to keep the weight off.",Missy

I am very pleased with results thus far and am looking forward to more weight shedding off. I increased my dose today to 1.2 mg.

I haven't had many issues.  The worst was the constipation but I offset it with psyllium husk fiber.  I have to limit alcohol to once a week.  I never ate fatty foods, but now I basically cannot eat high fat foods.  I also found that drinking more water helped ease symptoms, especially constipation.  I track my food with Weight Watchers.

There is a plethora of information online indicating that there have been lawsuits against the makers of this drug and its previous sister drug for its direct links to Thyroid and Pancreatic cancer.  Please be very careful taking this medication. If you have any severe abdominal pains STOP taking it.

Well I was experiencing stomach pains which end up getting so bad I had to go to emergency. I had gallstones and mild liver damage. Jaundice the whole 9 yards. Caused by saxenda. These were one of the RARE side effects and I was one of the lucky people to experience it. I spent a total of 10 days in the hospital.  The end of September and the month of October was rough for me. My liver enzymes were off the charts. I am ok now, gallbladder removed and liver enzymes are back to normal. So I'm letting you guys know this so that you are aware. Have your doctor check your liver enzymes and make sure you're good.

I've made sure to increase food with vitamins A-Z which helped.  Another aspect is that I do eat less but to help keep it off I do low carbs and count my calorie intake (1800).

I think that came off rather quickly because I've had nausea almost every day (none to mild to moderate). I can absolutely tell that the drug slows my gut mobility. When I ate a banana close to bedtime, I could tell it was still in my gut in the morning (unpleasant burps and more nausea). Never eating that close to bedtime again (which I know is not a good idea anyway). As far as dosing, I started on 0.6 and am slowly making my way to 1.2. I think if I titrate any faster that I'd be too sick! I am hoping the nausea goes away once I level out to a stable dose. I don't plan to stay on this longer than necessary, but have been told by my physician that it is important to keep taking low doses for a few months after goal weight is obtained (ie about the same amount of time that it took to lose the weight).

As of this Saturday 14/4/2018 I am now 99.1kg (220lb).  Almost 13.5kg lost in 7 months. Yes, weight loss slows down after the first initial losses, but don't let that dissuade you, it will keep moving slowly.  I took one break from the medication for three days in January to 'reset' as I had plateaued - this happens to a lot of people.  So I took a break, and after three days started again at 0.6.  I'd also say to keep an eye on your diet. The sugar cravings will return, and while I haven't gained at any point, my best losses have been when I limit chocolate to a small piece twice a day (think one mini chocolate Easter egg two times a day), and kept carbs as low as possible - and ditched bread completely.

333,Saxenda,Weight Loss,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2018",1,I started using some day end of October and just weighed myself today and am down to 212lb from 229lb.  I started on the 0.6 mark but decided to stay on the 1.8 mark because of nausea. I walk 5 miles 4-5 days a week and my target is to be under 200 pounds in a 6 month period.

334,Saxenda,Weight Loss,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 2, 2018",3,I continued to vomit all night and into the next day.  It was so intense as was the nausea and wasn't letting up.  Went to the ER for phenergan shots and was sent home quickly- so quickly that by the time I got home it started back up and I was in the ER for the 2nd time.  Ended up being admitted to the hospital for 24 hours for numerous phenergan IM doses- this was the only thing that worked and for IV fluids.  It was truly awful- I was so hopeful that this drug was going to be my answer to getting my life back.  It had to be the drug- no other explanation according to the Drs that saw me in ER and hospital.  Hoping to find out if anyone has known of anyone that had this type of intense reaction to Saxenda.  Thanks.,rll71

I can still eat out of boredom, but other than that I am losing the weight without much effort - I’m just mindful of what I put in my mouth.

For the first 10 minutes after I had a metallic taste in my mouth. But disappeared shortly after. Now 8 days in no more funny taste. I have lost 10 pounds so far. I personally think water weight.  I was on phentermine before and lost 50 pounds but then my thyroid started to act up again and I gained 20 back in a matter of weeks.  So my doctor suggested saxenda since I have PCOS with insulin resistance and hypothyroidism as well. Let's see if this works much better than the phentermine.  I already have been on low carb high protein clean eating diet. And walk an hour everyday and do Zumba with light weights.,Cyndibelle

Once I get into the 230's I will just pace myself with maintenance and stick to losing 5 pounds a month until I reach my goal of 220 over the next 4.5 months. Then see from there what to do.

I hope some of the side effects subside, I'm over the bubble guts, belching, bloating, diarrhea, and cramping. I sound like the peptibismol commercial lol maybe I should try that instead of the gas pills I have been taking religiously. Anyway, remember every body bodies react differently",Rose.P
479,Saxenda,Weight Loss,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 9, 2016",25,I started Saxenda with the trial box on July 20th. My first t week I lost 8 pounds. My insurance covered me for the full dosage. I'm now less than a month in and I'm down from 260 to 245. I get full very quickly and have slight nausea some days. Dry mouth is my major issue. I no longer feel the need to snack or crave junk food. I can say I'm happy with my results so far. Remember everyone is different and body reacts to things differently. Don't get discouraged it will pay off.,Chae33
480,Saxenda,Weight Loss,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 3, 2016",11,"I have been on Saxenda since July 28th, Since last two pregnancies I have been pre-diabetic for years fighting the onset of type 2 diabetes.  I vowed I would learn more about how to delay and prevent the onset as long as possible.  I learned a lot about nutrition and portion control but nothing about curbing the hunger pangs i would feel. I have used Phentermine pills in the past it worked but the jitters, insomnia and mild heart palpation's I had stop.  I was 275 now im down to 269 as of today.  I am still on 0.6 dose it did make me very tired during the day i slept all weekend but had to go to work on Monday so i switched to evening injections much better i sleep better now at night. I will increase my dose to the next level tomorrow.",CarizmaB

482,Saxenda,Weight Loss,10.0,,"July 29, 2016",17,"I started the injection 1 week ago today! I literally went from being a greedy pig eating anything sweet in sight and drinking several alcoholic beverages per week, to almost nothing now. The medicine stopped my junk food cravings and I don't even want a glass of wine with dinner. I used to skip breakfast & lunch sometimes and overeat for dinner and snacks. Now I'm eating a small dinner and that's about it lol. I have to force myself to eat sometimes! I'm 34 yrs old, 6'2, 243lbs as of last Friday which is the heaviest I've ever been. I haven't weighed myself yet, but I'm certain I've lost weight. I'm using My Fitness Pal to keep my calories below 1500 per day. My side effects: constipation, indigestion, insomnia, regurgitation, nausea",Ben Moore

484,Saxenda,Weight Loss,7.0,,"July 22, 2016",6,"I started Saxenda at the start of April 2016. On the first day I wasn't hungry at all and had to force myself to eat. Felt quite the same in the first week but from then on found myself eating much less.After a month I had lost about 4kgs (combined with regular exercise). I have now been on it for just over 3 months and have found the effects of my lack of hunger have worn off. I get hungry but probably not quite as hungry as I did pre Saxenda. I am feeling fuller more quickly during meals and my portions aren't as big but in the last 3-4 weeks I haven't lost any weight and have even put on a few cm's. I haven't been exercising regular since the first month.For sustained weight loss I think you need to eat healthy as well as exercise.",SarahQLD

486,Saxenda,Weight Loss,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 6, 2016",29,"Update...Started Saxenda on 02/01/16 down 32 lbs this AM.  Minimal side effects, certain foods make me nauseous, can no longer eat potatoe chips without feeling ill, but that's a good thing!  I think that a slow, steady weight loss is best.  Best advice is to take it day by day and don't get discouraged if you don't have a quick weight loss.  Eventually you will reach your goal and because it has been slow and steady those new eating habits will stay with you and you have a much better chance of maintaining your goal weight.  Good luck everyone!",SandyNeck2
487,Saxenda,Weight Loss,3.0,,"June 30, 2016",4,"Due to my genetics and hormone imbalances it is really hard for me to lose weight no matter how hard I try. My dr prescribed me saxenda and I was hoping this would help. It does, but looking at the studies people only lost about 20 lbs in a year. That seems pretty useless. Though it does work by killing your appetite and pretty much turning you off from food. So I did lose 10 lbs in a week but mostly bc I wasn't eating. However, it is not worth the god awful side effects. The injection stings and left little bruises. The first few days I was just a little queasy, then the nausea got worse, the stomach cramps and mix of constipation and not. Then came the awful sour stomach and reflux and the vomiting. After 2 weeks I'm done.",Asc134563
488,Saxenda,Weight Loss,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 18, 2016",24,I have been on Saxenda now for one week and lost 15 pounds.  I never in my life had my appetite go away.  Ever since I been on Saxenda I do not get hungry and I cannot even force myself to eat.   I got on the scale after 3 months from being at the doctor and I could not believe my eyes.  I lost that much weight. I am happy and I am going to reach my goal of 40 lbs.  The worst side effect I had was tiredness.  I am always tired but I am hoping to overcome this soon.  If not I can deal with the for another 2 months until I reach my goal. I would suggest this medicine to anyone that is obese and needs help.  This will definitely help with appetite.,Melott

On Monday May 9th I had strong chest pains while walking to the car ..... It felt like a giant elephant was sitting on my chest, my husband called 911 and I was brought to the hospital. I reported I was on saxenda but no one said much about.... My heart was healthily n they told me to follow up with my gallbladder. I took my 1.2 dose Monday and none Tuesday cause I read online about gallstones.... Has anyone had any problems like this????",Justmexxx
490,Saxenda,Weight Loss,10.0,,"April 29, 2016",20,"I started with victoza in feb  for diabetes. It made an amazing difference in my sugar numbers. I also cut out 95 percent of sugars i was (over)eating.  Between the two  I've lost 50 pounds in about 4 months. (i cut out sugar in january)  Ive had some stomach upset which comes across as a mix of feeling full and cramps. Nothing too bad and honestly worth it considering the results. MY a1c is now 5.5 from  10 when i started.The thing i like the most is my appetite is gone.  I am 45 years old and i've never not felt hungry.  I've always wanted to eat and did eat with out realizing how much I consumed.  Many times the sight and taste of food turns me off now which is actually nice. Sounds weird but I know there are those who will understand.",mr.mike
491,Saxenda,Weight Loss,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 28, 2016",31,"This is an update, now completed four weeks on Saxenda and experienced a 27 pound weight loss. Began at 284lbs, now 257lbs.  I'm a 55yo male and 6' tall. Now on full maintenance dose of 3.0. Still able to get through the day without feeling hungry and finding that two or three small meals per day satisfy what little appetite I have. The worst thing for me was the sensation of nausea over the first three weeks, but that has now disappeared. Still feeling a bit lethargic, hoping that will abate in time also. The cost in Australia for this medication is $380 a month and not covered by most insurance companies. I get a real boost when trying on new clothes, now one or two sizes smaller, a definite sign the medication and effort are working.",G'boy

496,Saxenda,Weight Loss,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 7, 2016",24,"Four weeks now and it's amazing, I'm just not hungry at all, not able to eat anything as much as I used to do, for example I used to eat 1x roll with cheese and tomato for breakfast now I can't finish it and only eat half. Same with other meals, lucky if I can eat a third. I've lost 5 kg so far without exercising. Yes it's expensive but I save on less food! Ok,so the needle is nothing to worry about, it's tiny and it doesn't hurt at all, I started injecting in my hip but the absorption is a lot slower so I went on to inject in my tummy and it's fine, just squeeze a roll of fat and inject :) In the beginning I had problems with constipation and I mean BIG problems but now it's a lot better but you need to drink a lot of water.",Tina Longe

I'm a 55yo male and 6' tall. About to commence the 1.8 dose, experienced fatigue and nausea most days, hoping the side effects settle down over the next few weeks. Haven't felt hungry since taking the first dose, getting by quite well on two small meals per day, drinking plenty of water and mint tea. No cravings for anything, really pleasantly surprised the mind and body have finally aligned to make real weight loss a possibility. Taking shot at night just before bedtime to minimise exposure nausea, no so sure it's working. Would recommend highly to those who have previously unsuccessfully attempted dieting and exercise regimes.",G'boy
