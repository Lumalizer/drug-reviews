0,Phentermine,Weight Loss,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 14, 2022",0,"I was placed on Phentermine 15 HCL capsules. It was been about 6 weeks, and I am down 7 lbs. Not sure if it's due to the lower dose, but the weight has been falling off slowly. Honestly, I am happy with it due to struggles with weight loss because of a hormonal imbalance. Also, you have to work with the pill. You have to eat less, definitely. Lastly, this low dose has not given me any side effects whatsoever. My sleep schedule has not been disturbed; just more energy. Will update as on month 2 and 3.",Q99

2,Phentermine,Weight Loss,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 19, 2022",9,So I did keto lost weight but ended up gaining everything back and more when I started eating carbs and ended up obese. Then I was stuck which was crazy because I’m the type that can get on track and lose weight when I put my mind to it. So I started phentermine  at 5’5 177 pounds the biggest I’ve ever been..I was scared at first because I have anxiety and I heard it could make it worse but I started taking it and the energy was amazing it suppressed my appetite but for the most part I really just got full faster after a meal. The thing that surprised me my mood was better I loved it after my first week I was down 8 pounds I worked out everyday and ate low carb the second week the effect started going away but I kept doing my routine and by the end of the month I was 20 pounds down which put me in my healthy range. My second month was my last month I only lost 7 but I was happy I got down to 150.I haven’t gained since I’ve been off just losing I’m now 139 :),Anonymous

4,Phentermine,Weight Loss,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 8, 2022",2,"I’ve never written a review before, but I will provide facts of my use of Phentermine 7.5mg. I have used phentermine on and off for several years with very little exercising. During my first use I lost 35 pounds. During my second use just before Covid, I lost 52 pounds in four months. Phentermine greatly reduced my sugar cravings especially at nighttime. I don’t know what it is about this drug but it clearly offers something that my body is not able to produce. I feel normal when I am on Phentermine, not running around looking for the next meal or candy etc.  The lone side effect that I have, insomnia the first few nights but then that goes away. I found taking a half pill the first three nights makes a difference. Though this drug doesn’t work for everybody, my wife has tried it and did not notice a difference. As has my daughter. But for me, it’s my miracle and for many of you it will be also. Again, this drug does not work with everybody so don’t be afraid to try it.",Jason
5,Phentermine,Weight Loss,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 6, 2022",3,"First time, I lost 50lbs. I stopped it because I had cramping so severe I thought I was dying. Went downhill after that. It messed up my hormones so badly, and killed my nervous system. I got vulvodynia from it. I was not aware thats what caused it. 2 years later, I decided to try it again. Took a long time to get my lifetime condition under control. A week into it, my condition escalated to that same pain I was in 2 years ago. It bad for my nerves. I have nerve damage. I will forever feel like my body is on fire.  No cure. Doctors deny it. This caused it! Beware!",Trixie
6,Phentermine,Weight Loss,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 26, 2022",3,"Not worth it! I was literally one pound overweight and wanted to lose 10lbs. For two to three weeks, I was a little energized and had a hard time falling asleep but really had NO scary side effects AT ALL. THEN, at about three and a half weeks after beginning phentermine, I was awakened in the middle of the night sweating and with my heart racing out of control. My heart was beating so fast I couldn't get a number. It ended up being  204bpm which is crazy dangerous. I had to be given a heart medication to slow it down, and even then it stayed at about 110 for three or four more hours. I was released to go home and I felt just tired and drained the following day. I went to bed early and got up feeling normal. I obviously stopped using the phentermine and my heart is at its normal 60-65bpm. Drs said I was lucky I didn't have a more dangerous arrhythmia or just collapse. Beware of this medication!",liltex84
7,Phentermine,Weight Loss,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 1, 2022",5,"Lomaira (phentermine):This is the low dose (8mg) Phentermine that is theoretically designed to be taken up to three times per day. Years ago I took the full strength 37.5 mg Phentermine and felt like I was going to die and couldn’t sleep. This low dose for me is totally different. I still feel a little wired but my blood pressure and heart rate are normal, and if I don’t take it too late I can sleep ok (although I have honestly have sleep problems anyway so I can’t evaluate that well). This dosage is way lower so you will have to be more careful with what you eat, you will have to take it at least twice per day (maybe three if it doesn’t bother your sleep and you have a lot of weight to lose). I really am glad doctors discovered that lower dose Phentermine works pretty well, because I just couldn’t tolerate the side effects of the higher dose but this lower dose is doable. Drink lots of water and do NOT drink caffeine or take other stimulants on this!",texshopper

My Dr prescribed 37.5, I started by taking half pill for 30 days and wasn't until I started the full pill that I have dropped 20 lbs in 35 days. I do believe the formula of this med has been changed as I don't have the dry mouth or the day long jitters as before. I have drastically changed my diet, eating low fat, low calories, high protein, less carbs.I  am only able to walk short distance due to knee. Now my weight loss has slowed back down.

The side effects are horrible it made me think horrible thoughts such as suicide. I would not recommend this to anyone. The cons out weigh the pros.

I started at 232lb now down to 209. I am 51 yo, 5’2’. This is completely contributed to a much lower caloric intake daily. I responded well to the medication, no jitters etc. I did get pretty serious dry mouth. I felt like I had plenty of energy but I didn’t feel super amounts of energy either. I now know that I can eat much, much less, still feel full and satisfied. I did not deny myself any one food or food group (i.e. carbs).  I did not follow any serious exercise plan which I’m sure would’ve boosted my results. I will maintain the same eating plan.

Today is my 7th week and I am 183 pounds a total of 37 pounds lost in less than 2 months. I dropped almost 20 pounds in the first two weeks and the remaining weight loss has been gradual and slow. I do not drink and I don't eat any carbs. My goal weight is 170. I suggest using an app to track your calorie intake.

I hate that feeling.But when my doctor told me my insulin levels were borderline diabetic and borderline high blood pressure. I was determined to lose weight (weighed in at 280lbs)  .

I took metformin at breakfast (about two hours after dose of phentermine). And at dinner time. The medicine helped me not go to cupboard for snacks, and seem to make me get filled up more quickly . After a refill, roughly a couple months, I started taking the whole dose of phentermine. Today is November 1st, and I sit at 238lbs.

19,Phentermine,Weight Loss,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 20, 2021",2,I took this medication years ago and I lost about 40 pounds in 3 months. I was in a not-so-healthy-relationship where I was being called fat frequenty. I kept weight off as I always as a skinny and active person. I gained all my weight back and a lot of weight over years due to depression low activity unhealthy eating so I thought I would give medication a try since it seemed to work first time. I am in a healthy relationship now I wanted to loose my weight because being over weight is causing me a lot of health problems. First month I only lost a couple pounds and after third month I was surprized see I lost 13 pounds. It wasn't  the 40 pounds I lost first time. I took this medication years ago but I am not eating as much and any weight off is ok.  I recommend this medication to anyone wanting to loose weight. I suggest you drink a lot of water and eat healthy. I do not think this medication is habit forming as some of your search will say. I had zero symptoms when I stop taking it .,weightloss55

I already had trouble with sleeping prior to taking a pill so insomnia was intensified I found if I take it really early and walk a mile after work helps me sleep.

38,Phentermine,Weight Loss,2.0,,"June 15, 2021",9,"I've been on phentermine now for 1 month and have only lost 6 pounds. Starting weight 186 now at 180.. 5'5. I took this years ago like 20 years ago when you didn't have to have a BMI of 30 and probably definitely didn't need it then. However what little extra weight I had on me then literally fell off, no exercise at all. I just had no appetite (I know now that is not a good thing to go all day without eating but that was what they did to me then) now they work for what seems like about 3 hours and then my eating is exactly. The same only reason I believe I've lost weight is exercise and trying to not drink any soda. I was expecting to start taking them and them have the same affect on my or at least curb my appetite a lot more than it has been. I go to my doctor today and I'm curious as to what their advice will be. But I'm definitely feeling more down because I feel like if these didn't help then nothing will. (besides surgery) Good luck everyone!  BTW I'm on 37.5 milligrams",GeenazJourney
39,Phentermine,Weight Loss,10.0,,"June 9, 2021",46,"This pill is AMAZING. I have recommended it to all my friends. My stress hunger and ALL my cravings went away. I am notorious for eating sweets and that’s one of my weaknesses. One of the best things that I enjoy about this medicine is the ability to take your hunger away. Some things to note is that while on this medication, it says do not consume alcohol. With that being said, I do like to have an occasional drink. When I knew I was going to have a cheat day, I didn’t take the pill that day because it negates the purpose of this pill. Also, I drank coffee one morning before an exam and took the pill at the same time, and bad idea. It overstimulated me.  For those that are considering this medication and want to be a healthier, happier, skinnier you, I highly recommend it. Make the choses to eat right while your appetite is suppressed. Weight loss is one of the hardest journeys to undertake! Good luck to all of y’all!!!",lilichka90

Side effects: no sleep , lower back aches , dry mouth, made me angry which I’m never angry. Also here and there a little depressed. But I would have to snap out of it very quickly. But overall it’s a good pill to take if you have self control and you won’t get addicted to it.  It gives you lotssss of energy which I like to work out in the gym or go for a jog at a park. You will lose weight quickly but you have to maintain it . I have a sweet tooth so I would eat chocolate after I lost all my weight then I would see I gained weight like 2lbs and I would work out the next day. You have to be consistent and dedicated.",Nora

After struggling with diets, exercise and medication weight gain, my doctor and I decided this was the best way to help me shed the 10-20 pounds I’ve been wanting to lose for at least 6 months. First and foremost, take this pill as early as you can because it did affect my sleep. On the first day I only experience light jitteriness, a little chest pain and a headache. My appetite was lessened. Today (the second day) I am already down a pound, I’m not very hungry at all and I only have mild jitters and a headache. Nothing that isn’t tolerable though. I plan on taking this for a total of 3 months only so I’m hoping I’ll drop the excess weight I’ve gained and develop healthier practices while I’m on it. I will say that the increased energy is nice for someone who wasn’t sleeping well and then wasn’t motivated to move around.",Bug

It has been six months since I have stopped taking it and I still suffer from extreme anxiety and panic attacks.I can't even go out with my family without feeling like I'm in a rush to leave. Just please don't do it. If you read this and you're feeling the same way reach out. If you're reading this and you're just starting to take them please be careful.

I was told to stop taking the medication and that things would get better but they didn't. Everything I do elevates my HR. Even laying in bed it goes up to 120.(norm is 60-100) 7 days later I ended up in the ER again. I spent the day getting every test done, blood work, xrays, EKGs, ultrasounds. Every test came out perfectly fine. They sent me home. But still, everything I do elevates my HR. I am exhausted, feel like I can't breath.

Because it's like an amphetamine it gives you amazing energy from the moment you take a pill in the morning I pop out of bed like I never have and even if I have a bad night sleep I can work the night with lots of energy. It's like a dream come true. I don't work out whatsoever and my suits at work are getting  too big for me.  I've been on it for about 2 months now and I am at a weight which I haven't been at for many years. I feel muscles in my leg that were always covered by fat I can now reach around to my back and scratch my back. Any downside to the pill like sometimes not sleeping good or dry mouth or even the new fidgeting of my mouth and tongue which is really weird is well worth it.

I had previously lost over 100 pounds doing Weight Watchers, and gaining that weight affected me both mentally and physically. I am a week in on my 3rd month of the pill and currently weigh 243.8. I am beyond happy with my results and I will be back down to my 100 pound loss in 13.8 more pounds! The only side effect I experience is dry mouth, and you do eventually become immune to the pill. I am starting to feel a little hungry again, but I am forcing myself to stay strong. You can use the pill as a tool for your weight loss, but remember, it is all up to you in the end.",Twilight

My doctor increased the dose to 30mg and the medicine kicked in again.  It appears that your body can adjust easily to this medicine, which is probably why it is indicated for short term use only.

Fortunately for me I didnt have any side effects from this medication other then dry mouth, but I just drank a lot of water. The upside is I had no cravings, I didn't have an appetite and when I did eat it was smaller portions. After being off of this pill the cravings do come back and so does your appetite.

You have to eat at least 1000 calories if not 1200 daily. You have to exercise a little. Even if it is just walking. You need to also take it very early and take it around the same time each day. Like 6am. 7am. I would not go past 8am if you are sensitive to medications. Otherwise you will be up all night long ready to run around. You also need to change the foods you eat. We are fat because of what we eat. This is not a magic pill that will melt your fat away. You need to correct yourself for it to really help you on your weight loss journey. This is all common sense. It raises your heart rate up (it's almost like speed). That is what gives  you the energy that we are all lacking. For me Adipex is a fantastic appetite suppressant. Good Luck.,Shellyt

And at the end of March I weighed 199.6lb so I lost 14lbs In March I was tired of keto and stared just eating smaller portions of non diet food. At the end of March I weighed in at 195.2 so not terrible but also not the results I previously had. On April 15  I started the slimfast diet. And on April 24 I went to the doctor to get Adipex and weighed in at 191.2lb  today April 26 I have just taken my fist Adipex. I’m excited to see how this goes. I’m going to continue to do the slimfast for the first month, I’d like to see 176lb when I get on the scale at my follow up appt.

Could be I'll start for a week or 2 and then stop. My issue is I need to be consistent with working out and taking the pill to see results. I do believe they would work if taken properly.

The only negative side effect I've had is mild constipation but it's probably due to my diet, not the medication.

288,Phentermine,Weight Loss,10.0,,"October 29, 2018",13,I took this drug once 6 1/2 years ago and lost 20 pounds.  I managed to keep it off for about 5 years and then stopped paying attention and gained it back.  My doctor has started me back on it again for 30 days.  The first time I had lots of side effects like bad headaches and dry mouth.  This time I have no side effects but I now know to drink a crazy amount of water.  Both times it took a few days to start working.  I still feel hungry at meal times but I can eat a very small amount of food and be full.  I eat carbs in very small amounts like 1/4 c rice or potatoes or 1/2 slice whole grain bread for fiber.  I stay under 40 carbs a day.  I do not eat pasta or desserts.  I do have to cut back on the food but use the drug for support.  I never take the drug after 3:00 pm or it will keep me up all night.  I try to wait as long as possible in the morning to take it so I get the effect through dinner.  I shoot for 10:00 am.  It's hard to get enough water when taking this drug so drink!,Lpeterso

In my opinion,  this medicine not only helps curb appetite but also blocks cravings.  They say it takes 3 months this to change a habit,  and I am hoping this is true! The only reason I gave it a 9 is due to the dry mouth.  Although,  it helped me drink more water! Keeping sugar free gum hand helps with that also.

I work the night shift as an ER RN, so regular meals never happen, I was averaging 900 cal day for  a week, and then the scale went up 1lb and didn’t budge for 4 days. Went over my food plan and realized I was starving myself, I wasn’t making time to eat. Past few days upped to 1300, and dropped 2lbs. Doc wants me at 1600-1800k BUT on work days that will NEVER happen as there’s nights I don’t have time to pee let alone eat. I have learned though that I need to eat at least 1200-1300k or the scale won’t move.Just remember once you come off the meds your body needs fuel. If you starve it now and expect to NOT gain weight once off the med then you are kidding yourself.I am 15 pounds from my goal, and when it happens it happens.

I'm truly dieting this attempt-avoiding bad carbs and focus on fruits, veggies and healthy proteins.  I'm taking full use of the drug with lack of appetite as the key benefit and exercising. Eating out of habit, food choices and portion control has caused my obesity.  Time to break the awful cycle and retrain my brain. I'm exercising, looking at food more as fuel and if I get tired during the day, I rest/nap.  I awake and get  going again.  Good luck everyone!",Boss Hog

I went on phent due to the cost of alternative drugs. My baseline wt was 306 lbs and I steadily lost wt for nearly a year until this past Nov when I had lost about 65-70 lbs (about 20+% of my base wt). My Dr said I was an anomaly  to most compared to others on phent. I had no mild or major side-effects assoc. with phent. By Nov '17 I plateaued out and gained less than 10 lbs through the Christmas period. Since Jan of this year I've alternated between taking phent for a month, then not. This Jan and Mar I gained wt when not taking the drug and in Feb and so far in Apr, I have lost wt when taking it.

I can happily say I have had NO side effects. I am hoping this doesn't change with the increase. It is hard to tell if my weight loss is due to my change in diet or the medicine, but I have come to the conclusion it's a mixture of both.

More protein, fruits and veggies. Less fattening snacks and greasy food. Your body will adjust with you and you will naturally fall into the habit.

I'm already on a blood pressure medication but I had it under control before I was allowed to start this pill.

906,Phentermine,Weight Loss,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 22, 2016",28,Hi I started this weight loss journey in March. I walked the park in January and February and wasn't losing anything. I weighed 225lbs. Until one day girls from around the area convinced me to go to the gym. One of my friends told me about adipex and how she is dropping weight. So I checked it out and started it in March and signed up for the gym. My eating habits died and I drank nothing but water. I cut all my soda out. Now it's July and I'm weighing in at 190lbs. That is 35lbs in 5 months. After  my 3 kids my weight just climbed and it was at the highest point ever. I feel soooo much better and my clothes fall off of me. It's a miracle pill but keep up with water intake and working out. :),Lisa g.

So if you are an emotional eater or social eater, this pill will help you avoid that bad habit.  The only side effect that I can identify is that my body feels a little strange and tingly.

The pills look the same except phentermine is smaller. I took half a pill of fastin instead of the whole thing and it feels stronger than a whole pill of phentermine.

1021,Phentermine,Weight Loss,10.0,,"March 15, 2016",29,"I've been on phentermine 37.5mg once daily for 9 weeks. The first week was rough: lots of headaches, irritability, with an easily evoked ""fight or flight"" response. Although I will say that when I was feeling irritable and unreasonably mad, I was well aware of my behavior and knew it was a side effect of the med. I also have underlying mild anxiety/depression which has gotten considerably more challenging on this med. I do take Zoloft 100mg daily. All and all between the weight loss and endorphins from exercising(30 min daily) made it a lot easier to handle. For all of my time on this med, sleeping has been challenging. I have to wait a good 17-18 hrs after taking the med before I can sleep. I tried taking half a pill and it was totally ineffective. I have always been prone to dizzy spells when standing up quickly or squatting and standing: this med intensified that effect big time. But after 4-5 weeks that side effect was much less. Dry mouth is also still very common.I  don't mind as it encourages me to drink more water! All said and done, it's been 9 weeks and I've gone down 37 lbs with little effort, and I still have zero appetite. I eat because I am supposed to, not because I am hungry. The effectiveness has only decreased around 15-16 hrs after taking the pill. I am 31, starting weight 252.  I am a huge fan of this med. The side effects are manageable and well worth the 37 lbs loss. Diet wise, I'm doing low carb/low fat/low calorie, I go out to dinner 1-3 times a week and drink minimal to no alcohol. I did not have any spikes in blood pressure either. The initial stimulant effect went away quickly, I just feel like my normal self when I take it. The most important part of this med to me, is that it takes away ALL my cravings. Yes it destroys my appetite, but being hungry was never the reason I overindulged in the past. This med makes food indifferent so I use it as I should:as fuel, not for pleasure. Also you will get a prescription for 3 months as it is intended to be a short term medication due to the side effects on your heart(read packet insert for details).

I have a check-up every month and have really put my mind to eating healthy foods and no pop or sweets (which were my culprits).  I drink water, but most flavored and never had high-blood pressure.  Only side-effect was insomnia for about a week in the beginning.

1035,Phentermine,Weight Loss,4.0,,"March 8, 2016",10,"I took two A.M. doses of prescribed 15 mg phentermine over the course of two days. I experienced ""amphetamine comedown"" symptoms in the evening of both days, including some minor chest pains and pressure, so I decided to discontinue the pills. I then had to endure a 3-day unpleasant amphetamine withdrawal period. From two small doses. I know I am sensitive to drugs, especially ""uppers"" and ""downers"" so I suppose that was the reason why this happened to me while attempting phentermine for weight loss. I will never take it again because I did not feel safe while on it. Just be careful if you are sensitive to substances.

Then on 5/3/14 I got back on it (so this is my first week back on) after only 5 days I've dropped to 177lbs. That's 38 LBS in almost 14 weeks!

I have tons of energy and my metabolism is super high. I had virtually no desire to eat at all in the beginning. But it's only supposed to be used as a very short term aid to help you make better lifestyle choices. Unfortunately, I have seen in myself and in many of my patients that once you stop, the weight will start to creep back up.

I ate more fruits and veggies.  I also completely stayed away from soda.  I don't have any problems sleeping.  When you are on Adipex you have to be seen by your doctor each month, the maximum time allowed on Adipex is 3 months.  Because of the risk of becoming addicted and other health risk that could develop.  After a few months you can get back on them, if so desired.   Because your only can be on Apidex 3 months at a time, the challenge will be keeping the weight off after.

I suggest exercising when you start taking it because the weight will come off even if you do nothing, and that can be deceiving in that you won't think you have to work as hard and you'll gain it back plus some when you stop.",Anonymous

2295,Phentermine,Weight Loss,8.0,,"March 28, 2008",57,I have been on Phentermine for 1 month and as of Feb 27 I have lost 15lbs. One of things I have really come to realize is that Phen will curb your appetite but it is VITAL that you learn how to eat properly and incorporate exercise into your daily routine. Not only will this speed up your weight loss whilst on Phen developing good habits is the only way to maintain your new weight once you finish.,Anonymous

I've found the longer I'm on the medication, the more addicted (mentally & physically) I am to it.
