6,Qsymia,Weight Loss,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 21, 2021",2,"I have been on Qsymia for 6 weeks. I am down 20 pounds with only one side effect - dry mouth (for which I bought some lozenges). I find a key is to keep water with you at all times. My routine is to wake up, take the pill with a glass of water, then have my coffee. Around 10 AM I have a small breakfast, then I am good until dinner. I have a small dinner (I haven't changed up what I eat, I just fill up fast and am able to walk away from the table). And that is it!  I have never been one to walk past snacks and not grab something. I was always a ""finish your plate"" girl.  Those urges are just gone for me and I don't miss them.  It is amazing. I had my check-in with my Dr yesterday and my blood pressure is down as well. I am just stunned at how well this as worked especially since two of my 6 weeks was when I was on vacation with a good friend who I cook with a lot.  We still cooked, I was just able to refrain from eating as much. The urge to eat is gone and I am not ever hungry.",Mary Z
7,Qsymia,Weight Loss,1.0,,"September 19, 2021",0,I started the low dose yesterday. I didn't notice any difference. I still ate like I had been. I was hoping it would make me feel real full where I didn't want more food. After dinner with tv I did snacking like I have been. Was hoping it would curb my thoughts on wanting to eat. One snack after another.  Anyone else feel like this.  Does it take time for it to work?,Ashley
8,Qsymia,Weight Loss,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 5, 2021",7,"I honestly thought I had COVID or I was pregnant as I lost my sense of taste and smell, this was when my  Qsymia dose got increased. I had never experienced anything like it. I can not eat sweets anymore. I also can't go into restaurants without being grossed out by the smell. Both are obviously good for the weight loss but freaked me out. The tingling, dizziness went away after a few weeks, only happens if I don't take it on time now. Overall, lost 25 pounds in 3 months with it. It helped me get full faster, which has helped me pretty much break my binge eating disorder, physically. However.. you have to still build healthy habits and do the mental work. I went from having 190/79 to 110/55 blood pressure too so didn't raise mine.",keke

The Mayo Clinic recognized my health issues & quickly recommended Qsymia. My side effects are similar to other posters, constipation, numbness in hands, mild insomnia, and dry mouth. As for what I am doing to assist in my weight loss.I stopped drinking all carbonated drinks and no more sugar. I am now adding and additional daily 30 minutes stationary recumbent bike exercise to the 7000 steps. I drink two 16 oz bottles of water every morning with my pill. I drink a minimum of 5 (16oz) bottles a day. I use my watch and phone to track my exercise and I document all meals on an app called My Fitness Pal.

10,Qsymia,Weight Loss,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 3, 2021",63,"I started taking Qsymia at the lowest dose at the beginning of 2020. I lost 50lbs between February and July. In July I had a tummy tuck to remove the excess skin from my abdomen. I had to stop taking Qsymia before my surgery per my surgeon, and had gained all of the weight back. I began taking the lowest dose of Qsymia again last month and I am down 30 lbs in 30 days. This is more weight off than the last time I took this drug, but now I am exercising much more often. My starting weight was 250, and I am now 220. My advise- taper off SLOWLY. Don't quit cold turkey like I did. I am currently eating 1200-1500 calories a day focusing mainly on protein but not cutting out foods I enjoy. Drink TONS and tons of water. I drink at least 2 L a day. This drug will make you lethargic and can lead to kidney stones if you do not hydrate properly, and most of your fat is excreted through urine- so drink water!",Hannah

My creatinine levels have gone up and I'm having chest pains though and insomnia. I spoke to my Dr and she said it's because I wasn't exercising enough so I started walking/jogging for the past 2 weeks to see if that helped the scale budge. Nope. Any suggestions?

Early on I was loosing a whole lot of weight I started off with a 1700 calorie diet, I didn't start with exercising due to my weight (325 was my starting weight).  I was down to about 294 by the begining of October (so Late August to Beginning of October I lost 31 lbs) and I began elliptical training slowly for about 15 min, then 20 min all the way to 45 minutes by November, weight loss tapers off down from crazy amounts to respectable amounts I'm now down to 2-3 lbs a week average and I'm currently down to 264.  I have had a great experience so far, I had to give up soda (topimax in Qysmia makes soda taste terrible, not so much a bad thing) I pretty much drink water and bubbly here and there.  Side effects: I have had dry mouth and constipation but I can deal with that.

I go to the doctor today to see about him upping my dosage to the 7.5 . I really didn’t exercise while I was on the low starter dose, it just made me not hungry, I did have slight stomach cramps. I feel better about about myself & I’m also teaching myself to eat smaller portions and eat better food choices.  When I do eat food, I tend to fill up faster.

It is true that carbonated drinks taste different now and I get a tiny amount of tingling in my fingers every now and then. weight loss has been consistent at a couple of lbs a week. Ate terrible during holidays and put 2 lbs back on in a month with eating badly and no gym but that would have been way more without the drug so I'm okay with it.

Also, I had some occasional tingling in my fingers early on, but that has subsided as well.  I know it's not for everyone, but for me, it has worked wonders.

In the beginning I had a few tingly feet sensations but that went away after time and I did feel weak at first but found out it was due to low potassium so if you're feeling that way have that checked out .

So you have to do your part by making diet changes (limiting portion sizes, eliminating sodas, limiting sweets and fast foods, etc.) and exercising to the extent you are able to get results.",Anonymous

First two weeks on half dose were most intense for side effects - dry mouth, light-headedness, unusual thoughts and dreams. All passed quickly when I normalized on standard 7.5 mg doze after 2 weeks. What has remained is a decreased appetite, no more unconscious or binge eating, and ability to just eat the foods I want to eat - healthy green veg and protein. Exercise 6 days/week.

I am not as anxious about my weight not coming off fast. I haven't had but one or 2 headaches, not even a full scale migraines . Just be patient and really focus on making good changes along the way. Wish insurance covered it.",Ditto3
361,Qsymia,Weight Loss,9.0,,"May 9, 2013",104,"I have been taking Qsymia for 6 months now...on the highest dose at this point.  I have been taking it exactly how it is supposed to be taken per my doctor.  I have physical limitations (bad knees) that keep me from being able to exercise much.  Walking is about all I am able to do.  I did not change my diet radically, the Qsymia changed it for me making me want to eat healthier because the crap food had negative effects on me and/or tasted like crap.  Becoming soda-free was the best thing that ever happened to me.  To date I have lost 83 pounds and have 57 more to go and know I will lose it with the help of this.  Would I recommend this to people?  Absolutely!!  Is it worth the tingling in the feet?  The dry mouth? YES!",CA1967
362,Qsymia,Weight Loss,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 4, 2013",52,"I have been on Qsymia for about 5 weeks and have lost about 15-17 pounds. Now my weight has plateaued and I can't seem to shake anymore weight off. It goes up two pounds, down two pounds, the same as before I began taking the pills. I have added some light exercise into my regimen and have gone down a clothing size. I'm happy with that. I think my body is adjusting/adapting to the medication.  I'm thinking of going off the Qsymia for a week or so to get it completely out of my system and start all over again. My cravings for sweets/candies have all but gone away. Every once in a while I'll indulge, but not nearly like I used to. I don't think about food until I'm actually hungry.",Nicey

I'm not hungry and eat because I know I should.  However, the side effects have now gotten the best of me.  After 5 days I need to stop.  The headaches are so bad and the strange way I feel has me worried.  My feet/hands are very cold and crampy; I've been drinking water by the gallon.  I don't want to stop but can no longer justify the side effects.",disappointed

I can't take anything herbal or over the counter.  My doctor approved Qsymia and I've been on it a week. I am already down 5 pounds. I feel like I have something to help me FINALLY. I eat clean, and with some help, can get back to an active lifestyle which will also help keep me positive with fighting my cancer. So far, so good. I will post again after 30 days - I am very excited.",Coach Amy

I have put myself on a calorie restricted diet of 1200 calories a day and I work out 3-4 times a week. The pills do help with my hunger and cravings.At first diet soda's tasted really bad and I had episodes of facial and hand numbness and tingling but those are the only side effects I've experienced. This all in all has helped me tremendously do what I couldn't do on my own. Some of my motivation to stick to it also it the cost. At $150 a month I can't afford to mess this up.",misslela

I used to get home from work and have a strong urge to eat and I no longer have that midday feeling.  It has definitely helped me control my appetite.

Anyway that being said, on Friday I started and not at the starter dose, full strength, no issues for me, I can't stand the taste of coke any longer or sweets and I have no appetite.  I have energy and have even started walking again.  I haven't gotten on the scale but with the energy already this could be the miracle I needed.",Getting Started

I went to my doctor when I heard about this medication and was told he did not write diet pills.  He told me I needed to exercise more and eat better.  He said It would only give me temporary results.  However, after reading everything I could find on Qsymia, I found that it is indicated for long term use.  I figured I would have a better chance eating right if I weren't starving and battling cravings every time I tried.  I actually changed doctors because I felt my doctor was minimizing my issue.  He won't treat my obesity but he will let me become a diabetic! I have lost 17 lbs in 2 months.",FreedomFred

I joined Weight Watchers when I went on Qsymia and have been eating on plan.  I am pleased with my weight loss but still have some cravings.  I can't tell that the medicine has curbed my cravings much at all.  I do have the dry mouth and this really weird metallic taste in my mouth that will not go away.  I haven't noticed any foods tasting weird except for diet drinks.  Still I think it is helping because I have been on Weight Watchers before without weight loss, so I will keep taking the medicine.  I hope to lose 25 pounds so hopefully won't be on the medicine for an extended period of time.",scottvej

Not only am I losing weight- 9 lbs and I never lose- but I am missing the one craving that I have struggled with for years- alcohol. Wine doesn't even sound or taste good to me, so I am saving those calories and have more energy and the money I am saving on food and alcohol more than covers the cost of Qsymia. I'm thirsty and was a bit tired mid afternoon in the beginning, but now I feel great. So glad I can lose weight without food that tastes like cardboard!",Thankful girl

I had lost about 40 lbs on my own with diet and exercise but plateaued. This has proven to jump start my weight loss. I noticed on the lower dose I was still hungry at night, but on the three days of the higher dose it seems to be better. I eat balanced meals, but they are more like snack sized portions. My snacking urge is completely gone. My only side effect I've noticed is some mild insomnia, but I started taking a Tylenol PM a few days ago to help with that until my body gets used to it and it worked wonders.

At first I was very excited because the weight was coming off extremely fast but my body caught on and the weight loss is slowing down. My appetite is suppressed and I have no desire for chocolate over a healthy salad. Side effects: On the second day of Qsymia, I noticed my Diet Coke taste like Diet Pepsi (I strongly prefer Diet Coke). In addition, I had the numbness / tingling in the face, feet, and hands. After five or so days, the tingling in the feet remains, but it is very noticeable at times (especially when lying down). About day seven, I started dealing with constipation. That may be contributed to the fact that I choose to eat healthy and foods without fats (to simulate movement).",Anonymous

379,Qsymia,Weight Loss,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 21, 2012",110,"I have only been taking Qsymia low dose for 4 days but so far, my cravings for food in general have significantly dropped. I am 40 years old, 5' 5"" and weigh 208lbs. I have struggled to lose weight for the past ten years. But food is my emotional crutch so it's been hard to maintain any sort of healthy diet. I was a smoker and when I decided to quit, I used Chantix and it helped stop the cravings and made quitting smoking very easy to do. I have been smoke free for over 3 years. When I heard about this, I was excited because it sounded like it worked similarly to how Chantix worked. It suppresses a part of the brain. What part, not sure, but in the past four days, my desire to eat has decreased tremendously.",jenlikesfood
