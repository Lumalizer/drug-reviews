Today my weight is 157.4 so I have lost 4.5pounds. S/E - slight headache and fatigue. I take it at night, and still tired throughout the day, but i'm hoping these symptoms pass with time. No nausea, I still have an appetite but not as big as it was before I started the meds. Still crave sweets but not as bad. I am hoping to get down to 145 pounds by May 16th which would be my 8 week mark.",Anonymous
1,Victoza,Weight Loss,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 21, 2022",1,"I started Victoza 12/9/2020 at .6 dosage.  I stayed at the level for almost six weeks because it was successful.  By February 1, 2021, I lost 25lbs.  Key point:  DO NOT EAT LATE AND GO TO BED… you will get sick in your sleep because Victoza slows down stomach emptying.I stayed on it until June and lost another 10 pounds.  When I discontinued use, I began intermittent fasting, lost another five lbs but slower.  Intermittent fasting is ideal to KEEP THE WEIGHT OFF.  I’m going BACK on Victoza to lose the last 30 pounds but the key is to listen to your body when you get off Victoza.  People who gained weight back starts eating wrong things.  My doctor told me that WHILE I am on Victoza to change my eating habits so I won’t gain the weight… and I didn’t… I lost more just much slowly.",Chrissy Girl

4,Victoza,Weight Loss,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 22, 2021",2,"I started Victoza yesterday.  After reading all the reviews I am optimistic about the results I could obtain.  Most reviews are similar in their description; however, there was one (may be others) that was a lot like my situation.  I had my thyroid removed almost 20 years ago.  My body began the process of gaining weight and it never reduced in numbers.  I am currently 249 pounds.  Doctors kept saying exercise, eat less, etc.  Had nothing to do with that as I do exercise (water aerobics every morning and walking in the evenings (as my other disabilities allow).  My issue is genetic.  ALL the women on my mother's side had the same thing.  And until their dying day they were very overweight.  They couldn't control it through exercise or dieting.  Even my daughters are now cursed with this issue.  So, I am looking forward to see how this works and thank all of you for posting.  It gives me hope.  I will post monthly to update on my progress and I look forward to reading about yours.",LadyJ7
5,Victoza,Weight Loss,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 15, 2021",3,"All I can say is if gastroparesis and fecal incontinence is the route you want to take to weight loss, as this drug provokes, this is the way to go.  If your like the remaining 99 percent of normal human beings you will see that this medicine actually causes medical issues that HAVE the side effects of weight loss such as the gastroparesis.  I would not recommend this to anyone unless it was absolutely necessary for diabetes.  The weight loss is almost non existent anyway with a researched average of 6 lbs over months.  I've lost 6 lbs exactly myself and that's where it has ended having started at 248 and being now at 242.  Hope this helps someone as I've found myself in public twice in just the first month almost losing my bowels in front of loads of people.  I mean like 2 seconds shy of not losing them and I am only 36 years old.  Not a way to live.",Jlp

I have real hope for the first time in years. I only wish I had known about this med sooner. It costs me $50 a month and I more then save that in food. I am indifferent to food like I never thought possible. It is amazing to go from compulsive eating to having to having to force myself to eat but that is what this med has done for me.

25,Victoza,Weight Loss,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 22, 2020",33,I started on Victoza 0.6 and initially the nausea was so bad I could not continue after 1 day. I stopped for about a week and decided to try again. This is now day 3 and I’m actually tolerating it better. I have not drank any alcohol and last time I had alcohol the same day I started my injection. Very bad idea... I now also take pepto or an anti nausea med  right before I do my injection and I take it at bedtime. This has helped tremendously!!! I still have some belching and a slight headache but nothing like before. I’m really excited that my body is tolerating it.

I should have stopped about 5 bites before I did. I take the injection at night before bed. 0.6 for now. Don't even feel it. I'll report again in a few weeks and see how things are going.

I’ve not exercised at all with this medication but definitely feel well enough to do so. 6 more lbs til I’m out of my 200’s.... so onward!,Sinsinattie
53,Victoza,Weight Loss,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 17, 2019",86,I started taking Victoza a year ago. I was amazed I lost 150lbs. I felt like I had gotten my life back but now I seem to be gaining it back. Very slowly but it scares me because I had no control over the loss and I want to control gaining weight. If I gain all that weight back it will be devastating for me. Anyone know about this?Help!,Mel
54,Victoza,Weight Loss,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 12, 2019",238,"I'm not usually one to review, but I have to share my experience of Victoza.  My Dr first prescribed this to me in January (2019) starting with a 0.6mg dose.  After the first month I increased to 1.2mg dose.  5 months later I am still taking 1.2mg and have not increased yet to 1.8mg.  To date I have not suffered with any side effects.  I can confirm that it has completely banished my sweet cravings and reduced my appetite by at least 70%.  As a result, since 5 January 2019 (today is the 12 June 2019) I have lost 90.5lbs.  This has been alongside a diet of  1200 calories a day, but I should add NO exercise.  Also, once a week, usually Saturday evening, I allow myself some ""freedom"" when I eat/drink whatever I like. To summarise, taking Victoza I can easily estimate that I've lost twice as much weight in a week as what I would have by diet alone.  If you're thinking of trying it, I'd say GO FOR IT - I'm so glad I did!",Missi

I’m just starting out on the lowest dosage and it’s 0.6, then each week I’m suppose to move up if needed. Honestly I don’t want to as  it’s working at this low dosage for me and nothing ever works. It took my sweet craving right away. I have no side effects at all and I’m not hungry. I make sure to eat my healthy meals like protein after working out and lots of greens. Staying away from carbs cuz they make me feel like garbage anyways. I do find I’m thirsty a lot which is good to increase my water. I’ve lost 6 pounds this week and I know at least 4 ish is water. I did get sick in the beginning I felt like I had extreme heartburn and threw up. What surprised me is it was the meal from the day before.

No bruising or anything around the site of injection. This is my second week on it, and I've already lost 5lbs. I haven't experienced any side effects, I did get a little nauseous the first two days but it wasn't anything that was so horrible I couldn't continue. I don't have any problems binge eating, it's great! I hope to see more results in the next few weeks!",Thalia289
191,Victoza,Weight Loss,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 25, 2016",30,"My experiences seems similar to Ptmazeik's review.  Days 1 and 2 were fine but Day 3 - oh boy. I took my shot at 5pm and I have to admit, I was excited. I was prescribed Victoza for weight loss. I imagined my extra weight just falling off. But the side effects were not worth it. On my 3rd night I was awoken by a butterfly 'wobble' spreading up my chest, arms and head. I thought I was having a heart attack. It was an intense nauseating feeling. It lasted for 13 hours. I couldn't sleep, I was frightened and I didn't know what to do. I eventually found milk would ease my symptoms and that excessive acid was a part of what was happening. 27 hrs had passed from my shot and I felt fine. Utter relief. Wont take it again. I did lose 3lbs ;)",thfcme
192,Victoza,Weight Loss,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 10, 2016",141,"Middle age stinks. In the last 5 years my weight and blood pressure became also uncontrollable. My last doctor visit I weighed in at my heaviest. 201# and being 5'7"" was categorised has obese. Plus my blood pressure was sky high. Dangerously high. My doctor told me about Saxenda. Well my insurance company would not cover it. So the doctor's office called in an RX for Victoza. I started the injections May 3rd. I followed the dosing schedule and increased the dose every 7 days. I continue to take the 1.8mg dose. I have lost 31 pounds since May. My blood pressue is now normal even abit low. I feel like I have my life back.",SpookyRN

I love the weght loss results, however  I don't ever want to experience  that terrifying experience of feeling like I was going to die. Ithe was that frightening,  I stopped the next day!",Ms. Ann

195,Victoza,Weight Loss,10.0,,"April 12, 2016",72,"I've been on it for a month and I'm up to 3ml. I had a lot of trouble during the month with eating, and I was very nauseous in the beginning. I was eating about 1-2 times a day but that started to wear off the 2nd week at 3ml and I'm back to 3 meals a day. I've lost 12lbs this month and I have to admit I was not as diligent with my nutrition and exercise as usual. If this works as well with partial doses and a diet not nearly as clean as usual, this gives me hope. Looks like I can finally reach my weight loss goals!",CdnWarrior
196,Victoza,Weight Loss,10.0,,"April 7, 2016",223,"I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) years ago. Last year, I was referred to a doctor that specializes in this disease; at the time I first met him, I weighed a whopping 387 pounds (I%u2019m 5%u201910%u2019%u2019). Of course, the first thing he told me was that my PCOS would get better if I lost weight. I was totally discouraged! I told him that I was very active and had been on EVERY diet%u2026 nothing seemed to work. I was so frustrated and asked if there was anything he could do to jump start my weight loss from a medical stand point. This is when he told me about Victoza and about the study that demonstrated that individuals suffering from PCOS, not from Type 2 diabetes, had lost weight on this medication... I now weigh 275 pounds :)",MarieQC
