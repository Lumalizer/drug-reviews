0,Effexor XR,Postpartum Depression,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 15, 2020",18,"My doctor told me Effexor is supposed to help with anxiety and depression. It didn’t help with my anxiety. I first started experiencing side effects when I was a little late taking my dose. Turns out that the side effects are actually WITHDRAWAL! It feels like I’m being electrocuted briefly then I immediately get vertigo and a sharp headache until my next zap which can occur every couple of minutes! The ONLY thing that helps is taking more of this drug! I’m trying to come off of it slowly but it will take at least 3 weeks and the withdrawal symptoms just keep getting worse and MORE frequent! Right now I experience the zaps every 45 seconds ALL DAY LONG and I’m only on my first week of trying to come off of it! I would never recommend anyone take this medication, rather ask your doctor for an alternative as the side effects are making my anxiety worse since I literally feel like I’m getting zapped constantly and it is a scary feeling!",PPD/PPA Mom

2,Effexor XR,Postpartum Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 24, 2017",17,"At 3 months post partum I started experiencing slight symptoms of PPD. I handled it and worked myself through it, thought I had it under control until I found myself uncontrollably crying, panic attacks, insomnia, excessive anger, lots of feelings of self worthlessness. My Dr first proscribed me Zoloft at 5 months post partum, for 3 weeks I had no luck. She then switched me to Effexor xr 37.5mg, as they say, the ""light bulb"" came back on after 2 weeks. I have had very bad anxiety since I was 14, I am now currently taking Effexor xr 75mg daily and am at 7 months post partum. Depression, the horrible self feelings I experienced were not anything I have ever felt with prior to this experience. Effexor changed my life!",I just wasn't me for a while
3,Effexor XR,Postpartum Depression,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 14, 2016",14,"after the birth of my second child and moving states away due to husbands job change I had HORRIBLE anxiety, what I thought was ONLY anxiety. I wouldn't leave the house for weeks on end. Finally 6 months later my husband and I agreed that I needed to seek help, being on medication was not something that I wanted, but something that I may need. At my first appointment I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. I was started in 37.5mg of Effexor and .5mg Klonopin! I'll admit! The first week ish, was hell, as it should be... For anyone to take a new medication to treat this type of issue its going to be tough. After those couple weeks I noticed a good change. Then it leveled out and I now take 75mg, this medication Is working so well!",2ndTimeMom
4,Effexor XR,Postpartum Depression,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 8, 2016",14,Was taking two 37 mg per day but made me nauseous so kept missing the second dose & wasn't working .  Now taking 75mg slow release per day. Was completely spaced out for a few days..zoning out!  but after 10 days I feel great. Loads of energy. Depression easing off. Impressed but hope it lasts . Side effects were dry mouth but this has now gone. Sex drive has also plummeted but I do have a baby so could be down to that. In any case I'd rather have my old self back than a sex drive so not too bothered.  Have tried prozac and citaloplam in the past until they stopped working. I'd say this is just as good if not better. Fingers crossed x,Helen248
5,Effexor XR,Postpartum Depression,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 5, 2014",6,"Effexor XR worked great at treating my Postpartum Depression - within 6 weeks of taking it, it was gone.  I did have a lot of problems eating on this, though, which was the reason I stopped taking it.",StephanieAlice
6,Effexor XR,Postpartum Depression,,,"December 11, 2013",27,"I have my life back thanks to this. I had two children and felt anxiety taking over my life. Never happy, angry, sad and depressed. Now my friends and husband says I'm back to being me and my kids feel the difference too. I'm more patient, attentive and generally a nicer person! I don't look forward to coming off the 75mg tabs I'm on, but will think about that when the time comes.",Lyn74
7,Effexor XR,Postpartum Depression,4.0,,"December 30, 2011",5,"My depression went away pretty quick, I was able to continue to nurse my newborn son. I took it for about 10 or 11 months it was so hard to stop taking. I had to split caplets up to cut myself down. ",Anonymous
8,Effexor XR,Postpartum Depression,10.0,,"April 5, 2011",13,"After a year of having my daughter I had postpartum symptoms and went straight to doctor because after my son 5 yrs earlier I waited and it was truly a nightmare, worst thing that had happened to me. Effexor really helped then but took longer to work because I was so sick. Effexor is a life saver and this time it worked right away....I didn't wait so long.",Anonymous
9,Effexor XR,Postpartum Depression,9.0,,"November 4, 2010",19,"After dealing with PPD for over a year, I began taking Effexor XR about 3 years ago. I'm sorry that I waited so long! I had been dealing with panic attacks, inability to sleep restfully, and various other issues during my daughter's first year. After taking Effexor XR (initially I was tired and feeling sort of sluggish) for about 2 months, I felt 150% better! I was moving around a lot more, wanted to be out and about, playing with my daughter more. It was a miracle, for me. It also took my mind off of dealing with depression, and focusing on being able to function. Actually being able to feel BETTER, and to deal with things that had been seriously affecting my overall happiness all along. It gave me strength to make life changes.",Anonymous
10,Effexor XR,Postpartum Depression,8.0,,"April 4, 2010",20,"When I had my first son in 2004 I developed postpartum depression within two days of giving birth.  It was the most horrible manic thoughts, racing heartbeat, clenched jaw and burning sensation in my upper body.  I thankfully was able to care for my son but I was sleep deprived for 8 days...which turns your head into mush.  I can't really remember the first 2 to 3 months of his life.  I went to the my primary doctor because of all of this and they put me on Effexor it really worked.  Within one month I was feeling so much better and I haven't missed a dose since.  I continued to take Effexor in my second pregnancy and I had a great pregnancy, birth, and continue in 2010 to take it everyday.",Mom of 2boys
11,Effexor XR,Postpartum Depression,7.0,,"October 20, 2009",8,"I am a mum of two. Been depressed in past but felt fine after birth to first baby and the following three years. Developed depression, anxiety, mania after second baby, almost immediately. I am now in hospital (mother and baby unit) with 9 week old daughter. I'm on Effexor XR 375mg and experimentally with Seroquel (too sedating), Abilify (not effective) and now lithium. Effexor is causing mania like symptoms and I have been taking it for 4 weeks. The introduction of another medicine will hopefully counteract this. Overall though Effexor has definitely reduced my lows from a 1/10 to never dipping below 5/10. Fingers crossed I can get out of here and back to normal, soon.",Working-it-out
12,Effexor XR,Postpartum Depression,10.0,,"September 28, 2009",21,"I returned to work, after having my second child, at the end of April.  By the begining of June everything was falling apart.  The job I had worked so hard to attain, my relationship, my friendships...nothing seemed to be going well, my two beautiful boys were the only thing keeping me remotely together.  I was asked to take a leave from work.  I started with Zoloft - terrible I clenched my teeth all day long!  Moved to Cymbalta - all I wanted to do was sleep, with two very active boys naps are just not an option.  I started taking Effexor XR two weeks ago now.  Love IT!!  The only side effect I'm noticing is short term memory loss, but hey my sex drive finally came back!!!  YEAH!  That alone does help alot with my depression.",Anonymous
13,Effexor XR,Postpartum Depression,10.0,,"March 21, 2009",29,"I started the Effexor XR 7 years ago after dealing with 2 years of postpartum depression. I finally stopped being stubborn and went to the doctor. It started working right away, but believe me don't miss a dose or be late with one when you first start taking them, you body will not like you.  I was off of them for many years and was doing well. Recently due to stress I have gone back to my old moody self and having blow ups and am back on them and again working right away. You feel much calmer and once you get through the time of your body getting used to them you are clear headed and happy. Don't let the first few days discourage you.",Anonymous
