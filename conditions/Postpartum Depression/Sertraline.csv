0,Sertraline,Postpartum Depression,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 8, 2022",1,"Zoloft (sertraline):I started having panic attacks 3.5 months postpartum. I had a difficult time finding a trigger (probably hormonal shifts) so it was hard to be able to avoid. My doctor gave me a prescription for hydroxyzine to use as needed until the Zoloft kicked in and Zoloft. I did not want to start the Zoloft. I was super-concerned about having to be on it forever and I am also breastfeeding and worried about transfer to baby. I tried to just use the hydroxyzine, but it did not stop them, it just calmed me down after they had started and I started getting anxious about the next panic attack. I was super-worried about being emotionally blunted as well as not being able to perform at a high level (have a demanding, technical job). I have been taking for a little over 6 weeks and it is a game-changer. I haven't had a panic attack since I started taking it. It doesn't eliminate anxiety, it just dampens it. If you are debating taking, don't. Just take the meds. You will be happy you did.",genomescientist
1,Sertraline,Postpartum Depression,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 22, 2022",4,"Zoloft (sertraline):Take this med!!!!! I promised myself I would come review this if it worked and wow does it work! I never realized how much I sabotaged my life before because of the anxiety I had on a daily basis.  Anxiety had become a normal feeling for me.  I had some severe postpartum depression that set in about 7-8 weeks post baby. I had lost interest  in everything, couldn’t connect with my baby, couldn’t sleep, was just wishing away time.  I decided to see a psychiatrist and she prescribed Zoloft.  I expressed my fear for this medication and she made me a plan to start at 12.5 mg until I could move on gradually to 50 mg.  The first week was tough.  My brain felt heavy, I had insomnia, was tired…. But after the first week all side effects disappeared.  I'm one month in and I am living life again.  I’m enjoying everything, I am no longer anxious, I’m sleeping, I am enjoying motherhood, I am just a brand new person.  Wish I had taken this medication years ago.",Mari
2,Sertraline,Postpartum Depression,8,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 7, 2022",1,"I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression since I was little. I’ve always been sensitive. I cried easily. I started experiencing anxiety in the 8th grade when I was stressed really bad. Ever since I had anxiety but it was every blue moon. I knew my triggers so I was ok with it. I had my son at the end of 2020 and my anxiety got worst and I was in and out of the hospital. I was so hard headed because I didn't wanna take medicine because I felt like I could get through it. I felt like I was crazy. I got angry, cried, couldn't sleep, I was loosing my mind! I finally told my self you need rest! And I started taking the medicine and after 2 weeks I’ve been good! I can enjoy my baby boy and my boyfriend. I still cry a little and having anxiety but its not as bad as it was before. Sertraline helped me a lot! I'm thinking about getting into therapy and taking a lower dose because I'm at 100mg and I wanna be able to go lower so my anxiety and depression won't get bad!",tianne_love15
3,Sertraline,Postpartum Depression,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 3, 2022",1,"If you are reading this I would like to tell you there is hope. It has been 5 months since I have started on this medication. I had a baby in Feb 21 and 6 weeks later it all started. I became agitated, restless, fidgety, constantly crying for no reason and feeling extremely anxious. I wasn’t coping with myself but I was trying to keep it undercover so that no one around me know what I was going through. I had so much pressure feeling in my head that it came to a point that I couldn’t remember stuff or concentrate. I went though so much mentally. My health visitor advised me to speak to gp and I didn’t want to go on medication. I started sertraline 6 months after going all though this and it is the best decision I made, I wish I took it as sooner. I didn’t think I would be able to back to work but I have returned to work. Side effects were horrific for 8 weeks at least if not longer. 5 months on I feel like me. Feel as thought I am ready to slowly wean off.",Nelly123
4,Sertraline,Postpartum Depression,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 17, 2022",9,"Zoloft (sertraline):With my second child, I started experiencing severe anxiety about the three week mark post partum. At first I thought it was the baby blues, but quickly realized something was wrong. I didn't feel like this after the birth of my first child. The anxiety got more and more intense and then the depression kicked in. I wasn't sleeping and I felt like I regretted my decision to have a second child. I wasn't bonding with her and I felt like I just needed to disappear and escape. It was a very scary feeling I immediately called the doctor around 4 weeks post partum after staying awake for 48 hours unable to sleep ( even though baby was sleeping). She prescribed me 50 mg of Zoloft immediately. The first week the anxiety was more intense (but that's common). By week 3 I felt almost normal again, and by week 6 I felt like myself. I started bonding with my baby (now 5 months and obsessed with her). This medication saved me. Please don't hesitate/ wait. You will be okay and feel like you again.",Amanda

6,Sertraline,Postpartum Depression,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 21, 2021",12,"Zoloft (sertraline):I was terrified to start this medication, but I knew I needed it. It took me a few months to muster up the courage to take the first pill. After I had my baby I had intense anxiety, intrusive thoughts, depression and rage. Everything would annoy me so, so much. I lived like this for months and it was ruining my relationship with my husband. I called my doctor and said I needed help I didn’t feel like myself. I am on 25 mg and it took 2 months for me to feel the full effects... I was doubtful it would work at first. So glad I feel like myself again, I want to cry with happiness because I haven’t felt like this in so long. Please, if you are suffering don’t be afraid to try this medication. I believe it saved me and my marriage.",Luna
7,Sertraline,Postpartum Depression,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 12, 2021",1,"Echoing other reviews on here, I started to get PND around 8 weeks after my 2nd child was born. I felt irritable constantly, snappy with my older child, I had very irrational behaviour, I’d come up with scenarios in my head and think they were real, I wasn’t enjoying being a mum (something I’d always enjoyed before) and I didn’t feel like I wanted to live my life anymore (I wasn’t suicidal but I just wanted to disappear far away somewhere away from my family) Since starting Zoloft/Setraline I honestly can had on heart say I feel so much better. Not high or elated but I feel like myself! Which is exactly what I wanted. I’m calmer, have more patience, I don’t wake up in the morning hating my life and I am enjoying being around my children and partner again. I feel like my temper is under control and I can process things more easily without going 0-100. I would definitely recommend this antidepressant and it’s something I will certainly be continuing with",Sophie
8,Sertraline,Postpartum Depression,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 20, 2021",0,Ladies if you are reading this I hope you aren’t in as dark of a place as I was from this medication. This made my anxiety/depression go into a severe panic state. Luckily my OBGYN helped me (my regular doctor prescribed me the sertraline) ask about trintillex and Resperidal (it’s called an anti psychotic but in low does helps tremendously with anxiety) Us mommas can’t afford medications to make things worse before it gets better Trintillex is an anti depressant which used with the resperidol took the anxiety away by THE NEXT DAY!!

It did not work well for me at all however I was extremely unwell already. It did not make life better for me in anyway. I can’t say for sure if it what caused this as I was severely depressed and had horrible anxiety by my main symptom was severe diarhea and upset stomach (I had purple, blue, orange, green etc... stool daily and no appetite but gained 25 pounds in 30 days not eating. I also had terrible terrible jaw clenching almost to the point of crying after sleeping (I read this was a common side effect online) it was terrible for me.

After 4 weeks of living in a a nightmare, I started medication and it saved my life. For my 2nd child, I started  Zoloft the day after giving birth. They gave me 50mg and I had a full blown panic attack. I was terrified. The uneasiness I felt was horrible. They decreased my dose drastically. I took 12.5mg for 2 weeks, then 25mg for 1 week, then 50mg. The first 2 weeks were absolute awful. This medication will make you feel worse before making you feel better. After 2 weeks, the uneasiness and anxiety started to subside and gradually got better nearly every day for 6 more weeks. By 8 weeks, I was COMPLETELY myself again. It's an amazing medication once it kicks in. You HAVE to let it work though. The first 2 weeks are ROUGH, but do NOT quit.

It is definitely still helping but the most interesting revelation happened. I have an amazing general practitioner who really wanted to help me figure out where my anxiety was coming from. We had many conversations and she then asked if I had the Mirena IUD. I did. After going over the timeline of when it was placed and when my panic/anxiety really started, she came to the conclusion that the IUD was part of the problem. We removed it about 17 days ago and the general anxiety I had been feeling has gone away. The rash I had on my neck is also gone. And the insomnia is pretty much non-existent. My OB swears it couldn’t have been the Mirena but my GP says she has seen this a few times. I have learned to always get a second opinion if you are experiencing postpartum issues. I will be weaning off the Zoloft soon and will try to write an update.",SG

This was my second baby but a completely different experience from the first. I had a complicated pregnancy and a baby born six weeks early. We had a short NICU stay and I thought I was great when she came home. Slowly I kept slipping into constant worry and became a nervous wreck. It effected my husband and four year old. I kept thinking that exercise and sleep could solve my issues but eventually came to realize I needed a little extra help. I started taking 25mg of Zoloft and the first week sucked! I felt worse, had night sweats and insomnia. But I want to give you hope, with time the medication will help. It’s been 11 days now and I’m seeing my life come back together.

A friend of mine said she didn't experience any side effects, so I thought maybe I would be the same. But this wasn't my case.

I really recommend this to anyone who is dealing with anxiety and obsessive thinking. Just to note, don’t stop taking the medication if your anxiety increases. The first few weeks were really hard.

The first week or two I couldn't stop talking and struggled to get to sleep but that soon subsided once I took the tablet first thing in a morning.I was prescribed this for post natal depression and I was quite poorly, constant worrying, over thinking, fear and dread filled my days, thoughts of suicide, thinking I was not up to the task of being mum even though I adored my baby. I wouldn't let anyone hold my baby for fear they would make him poorly. So once I plucked up the courage to say these things to my doctor even though I was so ashamed it was like admitting defeat, my god I'm so glad I did.

The second and third week were a little better, but my mood fluctuated and I’d have a good day followed by a very bad one that knocked me back.

I started on 25mg and had some intense side effects so I cut the dose in half and slowly worked my way up. Now I’m on 50mg and feel pretty good. When you increase the dosage slowly you have way less side effects and can tolerate this drug much better- you are messing with your brain chemistry so it makes sense! Anyway, I still have some anxiety but I also have a lot going on. This drug has made everything more manageable and now I know what’s real and what’s just my anxiety.  Also should note that I have not had noticeable PMS since being on it!",LHL

I worked great and after awhile, I quit on my own thinking I was in the clear. Big mistake, within a month or so the depression returned and my PCP stated, if it ain't broke, why fix it? Meaning why did I quit. He said if you feel well, it's b/c of the Zoloft so stick with it. My son, who just turned 16 has been on it as well, along with Adderall. While both drugs make me quite nervous, he has gone from a disaster at school, to excelling in many categories and I feel, is in a good place mentally. Hope I don't live to regret these choices! Good luck to all of you!",Linda
38,Sertraline,Postpartum Depression,8,,"June 4, 2019",2,"I was put in sertraline about a year ago. It helped me feel calm and more stable, able to deal with a toddler, a teenager and a house build. However around 3 months ago I tried tapering off. I'd ran out of the tablets so came off them over the space of 2 weeks from 50mg to 25mg. The physical side effects were awful but I ploughed on through until recently when I realised I wasn't coping again. My partner noticed I wasn't my usual self and yes I was acting a bit crazy/feeling crazy. Pretty much the way I'd been feeling with post natal depression before going on sertraline. The only good thing about coming off the tablets was getting my sex drive back. However I realised it's not worth it. I'd rather feel calmer and more stable. My only concern is that I'll get the initial side effects for a few weeks again like I did last time...dry mouth, head zaps and exhaustion. Today is day one back on sertraline and I'll be working closely with the gp this time.",Abbey

I went through the hardest and scariest thing I had ever experienced after having my baby. I though I had gone crazy and had no idea that it was possible to have these symptoms after having a baby. I was very hesitant to take any meds especially because I’m breastfeeding but my dr highly recommend that I take a small dose of Zoloft. I filled the prescription but still didn’t take it until one day I woke up and couldn’t stop crying because of the horrific state that my mind was in. I decided that I could not do this alone. It took at least a month and a couple of dose increases but I am doing so much better now and I really want women to know that it’s ok to talk to your dr and get help. I’m so grateful that we now have access to this medication and I’m so glad that I stopped being stubborn and just accepted the help.

The first 2 wks were hell due to the horrendous nausea, insomnia, & severe bouts of panic/anxious feelings - for awhile it felt worse than what I was initially experiencing and I felt like quitting altogether. All of this seemed to disappear after about 2 wks.After about 6 weeks I felt much better. This drug is truly a miracle (I’d been on Paxil yrs before & didn’t help nearly as much as zoloft has).
