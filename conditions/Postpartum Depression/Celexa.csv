0,Celexa,Postpartum Depression,2,,"January 22, 2020",6,"Initial symptoms, premenstrual dysphoric syndrome. Extreme Irritability in evenings the week before period. While used to be fine after period, I started having depressed mood. Only time of the month feeling good was around ovulation.Started on 10 mg. First week, queasiness, dizziness, no appetite, brain fog. Allowed self to eat junk or whatever sounded appealing. Protein shakes.  Initial effects improved after the first week. No real notable differenceAfter a few weeks increased to 20 mg. Lack of appetite returned. Started having excruciating headaches, tension headaches and clenching of jaw. Worsened depression. No motivation or desire to do anything. Headaches resolved. At 7-8 wks. Extremely tired. Sad blah heavy face feeling. Anxiety may be worse. Probably less irritable but donâ€™t feel the other side effects are worth it. Felt better the next day after decrease to 10. Then switched to Paxil and have have no side effects and doing well one month in!!!",sam
1,Celexa,Postpartum Depression,1,,"July 27, 2017",8,"Horrible experience. Couldn't differ between dreams and actuality. Unfortunately lost custody of my child while on this medication because the paternal grandparents convinced me to sign ""insurance papers"" which were actually custody papers. They knew what my mental state was at the time due to Celexa. I was very easily agitated and very delusional. At one point I thought my daughter had turned into a puppy. Another point, I thought I took a trip that was about an hour away and got back home within 5 minutes with no recollection of the trip back. These were actually dreams that I thought was happening in reality. I was in such a horrible mental state that I couldn't even tell that I wasn't myself, that I was delusional,  or irrational.",Medviewanon
2,Celexa,Postpartum Depression,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 30, 2016",7,"This is by far the worst antidepressant I have ever taken in my life. I took this pill for Severe post-partum anxiety/OCD. I stayed on it for 17 months. And it was truly the worst 17 months of my life. The worst intrusive thoughts I have ever experienced, felt like I was in a constant panic attack 24/7 where I literally felt like I was going insane, my thoughts were constant loops of irrational fears and I would do anything to try and make them stop, I thought I had something spiritually wrong with me or I was going insane, horrible derealization, lost connection with almost every person except my boyfriend, no connection with my baby, couldn't feel any of my body, lost all faith in God and hope.",aasldfhasdiovpasdifafasdfpaosd
3,Celexa,Postpartum Depression,10,,"February 1, 2016",34,"I have always struggled with depression but after giving birth my depression spiraled out of control. I was miserable every second of the day. My husband finally told me I make an appointment or he makes it for me. I started off at 10mg of Celexa, and was moved up to 20mg. It has completely turned my life around. I finally feel like I'm living again. I haven't had any side effects other than minor headaches.",Chantnn
4,Celexa,Postpartum Depression,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 9, 2013",82,"I am not sure if I had post partum depression or not, my youngest child is 2 and it seems ever since having her I've been not the best mom out there, or wife.  I was very moody all the time and just recently it has gotten worse. I felt like I was always on a rage at home, yelling at everyone, everything getting on my nerves, snapping at family members, it was terrible. Celexa saved my life! I felt improvement within days. I feel more calm and no longer have the urges to yell and get angry with anyone. Have experienced headaches and fatigue & yawning, but nothing compared to how I was feeling before so I can handle the side effects! I am on week 3 now, hoping they diminish with time.",Mommy3dd
5,Celexa,Postpartum Depression,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 28, 2012",55,"I began to feel better almost immediately- within 4 days I could really tell a difference in my stress level and more overall depression. I feel much better, and I am thankful I that I decided to seek help. This has not solved all my problems, but it put me in a frame of mind to be able to deal with them rather than feel out of control and hopeless. Best decision I could have made not only for myself, but my family. the only side effect that I have experienced is difficulty reaching orgasm. But honestly it has helped me so much, I am more than willing to live with this than go back to the way I was before.",Anonymous
6,Celexa,Postpartum Depression,10,,"August 14, 2012",26,"I was struggling depression for 19 years. I always held everything in and never told anyone, so I've tried to hurt myself a couple times. Finally 4 weeks ago I admitted myself to a hospital and they sent me to a mental health place where I stayed for 2 weeks and was put on Celexa. I was scared to get on but knew I had to do something and I am so glade I did. I feel like a whole new person without the stress and wondering where my life's going. Thank you Celexa. Now hopefully I can get insurance and stay on it.",Navehangel
7,Celexa,Postpartum Depression,10,,"March 20, 2012",56,"I used Celexa for postpartum depression and it was like a miracle!  I had a sick baby and just thought I was a 'bad mom' and couldn't handle the stress.  My marriage took a big hit and my husband refused to have a 2nd child with me due to the depression/anxiety.  I spoke to my doctor when my son was 7-8 months old and went on 10 mg of Celexa.  It was like turning on a light in a dark room!  I sure wish I would have figured out what was wrong with me sooner!  I tried to go off after about a year, but the moodiness and irritability came back, so I went back on for another 6 months or so before successfully stopping.  Few side effects for me.  I would recommend!",Anonymous
8,Celexa,Postpartum Depression,10,,"October 10, 2011",44,"I have been on Celexa for about a year. I absolutely love my 'happy pill'. My whole family loves me and I love them. The only side effects I have had are migraines if I skip a dose, or increased irritation if I take an extra dose. I don't mind the migraines as they remind me to take my Celexa when life has me running. Glad my doctor listened to me and proscribed this medication. Zoloft and Wellbutrin did not work at all for me. I have been on 20mg the entire time. Hopes this helps others.",mom of 4 plus triplets
9,Celexa,Postpartum Depression,9,,"November 17, 2010",34,"Celexa worked wonders for my postpartum depression.  My depression stated later than normal, my child was 9 months.  At first I felt ""out of it"", like I couldn't concentrate.  After a week that went away.  I also have mild OCD and it helped that too.  I did gain a little weight and was craving food more.  My husband says he noticed a good change in me, better mood.",Anonymous
10,Celexa,Postpartum Depression,1,,"September 18, 2009",9,"I took citalopram for 10 days but had to stop due to an allergic reaction I got from it.  Besides that, I could not sleep at night after taking the medication.  Unfortunately citalopram did not work for me at all.",Anonymous
11,Celexa,Postpartum Depression,7,,"June 14, 2009",14,"I started taking Celexa for post-partum depression about 2 years ago. Started at 20mg and have been on 40mg for over a year now. I'm not sure if its related, but the past 6 months or so, I have had increasing muscle/joint pain, with fatigue and insomnia. I've been absolutely miserable. I will say that for the depression and mood swings Celexa is great, provided you don't get the UNcommon side effects.",Anonymous
