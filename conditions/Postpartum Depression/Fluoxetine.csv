0,Fluoxetine,Postpartum Depression,9,,"July 13, 2021",4,"Prozac (fluoxetine):After labour I suffered from rare condition of postpartum psychosis, cured with Abilify. Then it was followed by horrible insomnia and anxiety. I tried every sleeping pill and benzo, and tricyclics, didn’t work. So my doctors decided to prescribed Prozac 20 mg per day (morning) for 6 months. First weeks I had little cramps in my ankles and not much change in my mood, but immediately less anxious, and by week 3-4 it finally kicked in, didn’t feel so sad anymore. Gradually my sleep came back, from 4-5 hours with early awakenings to solid 8-9. I  had a rare side effect-pigmentation around eyes became slightly orange, but it was gone after I started to wean off. When I started Prozac my depression was 60 out of 63 according to Beck’s depression inventory (severely depressed). Now after treatment it’s only 9! (not depressed). The worst side-effect is that despite dieting I gained 30 ibs!",Varvarita

The start up side effects are not pleasant but worth battling through. My postnatal depression and anxiety was very severe, I honesty thought I was going crazy, this medication saved me.",Rhiroo
