0,Citalopram,Postpartum Depression,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2022",0,I’ve been on citalopram for 2 weeks because of postpartum depression and anxiety. I have not had any bad side affects. The first day of taking it I immediately felt calmer. I can now enjoy my child and myself. It also gives me so much energy which I love!,Anonymous
1,Citalopram,Postpartum Depression,8,,"February 11, 2022",0,"I started taking 10mg a day for a month because I have always been really sick (panic/anxiety/stress/postpartum) when I’ve started different anti depressants. This was the first one I took that didn’t have any side effects. I increased to 20mg 2 weeks ago. I still have no side effects! This is the first time I am able to continue taking antidepressants in my life. I notice some relief in my symptoms but I think that I am probably someone who needs 40mg a day to get more complete relief. My anxiety, depression, and panic attacks where getting me hospitalized before I started celexa. Now I am 2 months hospital free and starting to return to my normal life.",Feelbetter
2,Citalopram,Postpartum Depression,3,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 23, 2020",6,"I have been taking citalopram for 8 months now. Until I started reading these reviews I thought I was having problems due to my c-section or postpartum hormonal issues. I have gained 40 lbs. I have had diarrhea for 8 months. I have zero sex drive. I feel like I’ve just lost all feeling down there. I have hot flashes, night sweats and I’m just exhausted all the time. It did help with my postpartum anxiety/depression, but now that I know everything I’m experiencing could be side effects linked to this prescription I am going to quit taking it.",TL
3,Citalopram,Postpartum Depression,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 12, 2020",4,"I have suffered with PMDD for most of my adult life, it really got its worst in my mid 20's. It steals 2 weeks of my life every month from me. I am 31 and just also recently gave birth. After 7 weeks postpartum upon returning to work I would have several panic attacks a day along with the one of the worst depressions I have experienced. I felt physically sick from the sadness of leaving my baby every day for work. I am on day 4 of 10 mg of Citalopram and the panic attacks are GONE, my OCD repetitive thoughts are GONE, I still feel a bit sad but I don't dwell on it. First two days I had headaches, dry mouth, nausea, gastro upset, difficulty orgasming, and felt ""weird"". All have subsided but the orgasm difficulty. I am so thankful for the immediate relief from the nightmare I was experiencing. It's like somebody turned the light on in my dark mind! I can smile and mean it again.",Mel
4,Citalopram,Postpartum Depression,2,,"January 22, 2020",6,"Celexa (citalopram):Initial symptoms, premenstrual dysphoric syndrome. Extreme Irritability in evenings the week before period. While used to be fine after period, I started having depressed mood. Only time of the month feeling good was around ovulation.Started on 10 mg. First week, queasiness, dizziness, no appetite, brain fog. Allowed self to eat junk or whatever sounded appealing. Protein shakes.  Initial effects improved after the first week. No real notable differenceAfter a few weeks increased to 20 mg. Lack of appetite returned. Started having excruciating headaches, tension headaches and clenching of jaw. Worsened depression. No motivation or desire to do anything. Headaches resolved. At 7-8 wks. Extremely tired. Sad blah heavy face feeling. Anxiety may be worse. Probably less irritable but don’t feel the other side effects are worth it. Felt better the next day after decrease to 10. Then switched to Paxil and have have no side effects and doing well one month in!!!",sam
5,Citalopram,Postpartum Depression,3,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 9, 2019",3,"Started taking Citalopram after another anti-depressant that didn’t work. I don’t remember the side effects to begin with as I don’t think I actually suffered too bad! A year and a half later and I’ve gained 2 stone, have little to no energy, suffer from somnolence (excessively sleeping I could sleep all night and day and still have no energy!), profusely sweating, constantly hot, I can’t stand wearing clothes only soft nightdresses, I now have high anxiety which I didn’t have before, shaking and not being able to get my words out properly when talking. These side effects have only just started and have now made me decide I no longer want these affecting my body! I’m hoping to come off them next week under guidance from my GP. I would say they have helped me with my post traumatic stress disorder (extremely difficult labour) so I do think they helped, just not anymore!",Becky hthhhm
6,Citalopram,Postpartum Depression,1,,"July 27, 2017",8,"Celexa (citalopram):Horrible experience. Couldn't differ between dreams and actuality. Unfortunately lost custody of my child while on this medication because the paternal grandparents convinced me to sign ""insurance papers"" which were actually custody papers. They knew what my mental state was at the time due to Celexa. I was very easily agitated and very delusional. At one point I thought my daughter had turned into a puppy. Another point, I thought I took a trip that was about an hour away and got back home within 5 minutes with no recollection of the trip back. These were actually dreams that I thought was happening in reality. I was in such a horrible mental state that I couldn't even tell that I wasn't myself, that I was delusional,  or irrational.",Medviewanon
7,Citalopram,Postpartum Depression,1,,"May 16, 2017",3,I was diagnosed with prenatal depression and was prescribed this awful drug. I took ONE 2.5mg dose as directed. The next 8 hours were a blur. I can only describe it as being really drunk.  My heart rate dropped from it's usual 89bpm to 60bmp and my breathing became so slow and irregular.  I was in bed and could not move a muscle and was terrified I was going to stop breathing. Eventually I had to use the washroom and when I got up I collapsed. Will never ever take again.,Van604
8,Citalopram,Postpartum Depression,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 30, 2016",7,"Celexa (citalopram):This is by far the worst antidepressant I have ever taken in my life. I took this pill for Severe post-partum anxiety/OCD. I stayed on it for 17 months. And it was truly the worst 17 months of my life. The worst intrusive thoughts I have ever experienced, felt like I was in a constant panic attack 24/7 where I literally felt like I was going insane, my thoughts were constant loops of irrational fears and I would do anything to try and make them stop, I thought I had something spiritually wrong with me or I was going insane, horrible derealization, lost connection with almost every person except my boyfriend, no connection with my baby, couldn't feel any of my body, lost all faith in God and hope.",aasldfhasdiovpasdifafasdfpaosd

I was miserable every second of the day. My husband finally told me I make an appointment or he makes it for me. I started off at 10mg of Celexa, and was moved up to 20mg. It has completely turned my life around. I finally feel like I'm living again. I haven't had any side effects other than minor headaches.",Chantnn

11,Citalopram,Postpartum Depression,7,,"January 10, 2015",16,"After I had my child I soon started to cry, be angry all the time, felt bored of life, nothing excited me. So I was suggested to take Citalopram, it started to work within 3 weeks I only got headaches and a little bit of diarrhea. Then I finally felt like there was light at the end of the tunnel my anxiety and panic attacks also went away nearly a year I have to decided I want another child so I am slowly ( with doctors permission ) coming off so far a little cloudy some days but so far so good. Trying to stay positive. Depression can be fixed with the right treatment speak up.",Brightfuture01
12,Citalopram,Postpartum Depression,10,,"February 5, 2014",26,After I had postpartum depression after 2 weeks of giving birth then my 9 months through it got really worse. I would always snap at my boyfriend about the little things. I got irritated very easily and would cry everyday. All I wanted to do was sleep. I also tried counseling before deciding to take medicines. I just felt like a horrible mom. I took Celexa and after a week I felt the change in me right away. I felt more about things and my anxiety went away. I had more energy to do things and more motivated to do things. I love being me again.,shnbsng
13,Citalopram,Postpartum Depression,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 9, 2013",82,"Celexa (citalopram):I am not sure if I had post partum depression or not, my youngest child is 2 and it seems ever since having her I've been not the best mom out there, or wife.  I was very moody all the time and just recently it has gotten worse. I felt like I was always on a rage at home, yelling at everyone, everything getting on my nerves, snapping at family members, it was terrible. Celexa saved my life! I felt improvement within days. I feel more calm and no longer have the urges to yell and get angry with anyone. Have experienced headaches and fatigue & yawning, but nothing compared to how I was feeling before so I can handle the side effects! I am on week 3 now, hoping they diminish with time.",Mommy3dd
14,Citalopram,Postpartum Depression,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2012",7,"I have a 6 month old old & history of anxiety. Had strong baby blues post c-section; postpartum depression followed. Struggled on my own for months but upon trying to return to work fell hard into depression. Doc put me on 10mg Citalopram. Day 4 right now- can't say whether its effective yet as I know its weeks and or months before we can conclusively say. Have had strong side effects though: very sore stomach, racing heart, break into sweat, dry mouth & insomnia. I take pills at night as I was forewarned about the drowsiness. Willing to try this for longer though despite side effects which are likely short term. Ten years ago was on Zoloft and another antidepressant with poor results.",Postpard
15,Citalopram,Postpartum Depression,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 28, 2012",55,"Celexa (citalopram):I began to feel better almost immediately- within 4 days I could really tell a difference in my stress level and more overall depression. I feel much better, and I am thankful I that I decided to seek help. This has not solved all my problems, but it put me in a frame of mind to be able to deal with them rather than feel out of control and hopeless. Best decision I could have made not only for myself, but my family. the only side effect that I have experienced is difficulty reaching orgasm. But honestly it has helped me so much, I am more than willing to live with this than go back to the way I was before.",Anonymous

I always held everything in and never told anyone, so I've tried to hurt myself a couple times. Finally 4 weeks ago I admitted myself to a hospital and they sent me to a mental health place where I stayed for 2 weeks and was put on Celexa. I was scared to get on but knew I had to do something and I am so glade I did. I feel like a whole new person without the stress and wondering where my life's going. Thank you Celexa. Now hopefully I can get insurance and stay on it.",Navehangel
17,Citalopram,Postpartum Depression,10,,"March 20, 2012",56,"Celexa (citalopram):I used Celexa for postpartum depression and it was like a miracle!  I had a sick baby and just thought I was a 'bad mom' and couldn't handle the stress.  My marriage took a big hit and my husband refused to have a 2nd child with me due to the depression/anxiety.  I spoke to my doctor when my son was 7-8 months old and went on 10 mg of Celexa.  It was like turning on a light in a dark room!  I sure wish I would have figured out what was wrong with me sooner!  I tried to go off after about a year, but the moodiness and irritability came back, so I went back on for another 6 months or so before successfully stopping.  Few side effects for me.  I would recommend!",Anonymous

The only side effects I have had are migraines if I skip a dose, or increased irritation if I take an extra dose. I don't mind the migraines as they remind me to take my Celexa when life has me running. Glad my doctor listened to me and proscribed this medication. Zoloft and Wellbutrin did not work at all for me. I have been on 20mg the entire time. Hopes this helps others.",mom of 4 plus triplets

I had my first baby in May and was finding normal day to day living difficult. Like I said, I couldn't afford my old medication and this was definitely an affordable choice.
