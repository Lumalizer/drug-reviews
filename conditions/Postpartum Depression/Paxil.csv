0,Paxil,Postpartum Depression,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 23, 2019",15,"This is the worst medicine ever. I took it for postpartum anxiety  and it turned my anxiety into severe depression which I have never experienced in my life. When I took it I became insomniac, dark thoughts, feeling deep unworthiness, wanting to leave my family, could barely walk, heart palpitation, nausea, weak memory. At some point, I became so numb and I felt so aggressive which I have never felt before in my life. I took it for 2 months and a half. I was taking 10 mg at a time. Withdrawal symptoms: non stop crying for no reason and ideation. Now I am on week 4 since I stopped it and the withdrawal symptoms are still horrible. The ideation disappeared but the uncontrollable crying spells, coughing, insomnia are still there. sometimes I really feel like I lost my mind. This is again the worst thing that ever happened to me in my life. It is poison.",Cic
1,Paxil,Postpartum Depression,5,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 5, 2018",4,"I was prescribed Paxil when I was 10 months postpartum and experiencing debilitating anxiety. My PCP diagnosed me with postpartum depression/anxiety and put me on Paxil.  I became extremely calm, but completely apathetic and eventually quit my lucrative 10+ year career.Switched to Wellbutrin, which I've been on for 6 weeks and notice a huge difference.  The reduction in stress is the same for me with Paxil and Wellbutrin. I have so much more energy.  I am more determined and do not mind going to the grocery store at all. I am more focused on a course I'm taking and am completely committed to succeeding in my new career endeavor.",StormyApril
2,Paxil,Postpartum Depression,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 8, 2017",1,"Prescribed paxil for depression, anxiety and OCD of contamination. I took 10mg of paxil for 1.5 months. I experienced no side effects, which was the only upside. I experienced PPDA only 1 month after my first and only son was born. As a 1st time mom I thought everything I was experiencing was typical, until I began having suicidal thoughts and resorted to self harm, all taking a toll on my relationship w/ my son and husband. Waited for 10 months to finally get help. While taking paxil at first I felt better and more connected to my baby until two weeks later I noticed I felt EXTREMELY unmotivated, lazy, zombieish and uncaring. I went from one extreme with OCD to never cleaning anything ever. So I felt just as depressed as before.",Mamanainteasy
3,Paxil,Postpartum Depression,1,,"October 6, 2017",2,The first week Paxil was great I felt better no more anxiety and I felt happy and not stressed. But now going on the 3rd week I feel so sleepy I have no interest in doing anything and I'm jittery at the same time. I've never been not interested in doing house cleaning or going outside but now I don't want to do anything but sleep.,Mommyof2bbys
4,Paxil,Postpartum Depression,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 28, 2016",17,I was suffering from ppd/a. Zoloft and lexapro made me feel worse. I wanted to try paxil but the bad reviews scared me. Good thing I listened to my doctor because it's the only thing that has helped me. Side effects weren't bad. I haven't gained weight. I feel a little hyper sometimes but that just makes me actually want to get up and do things again.,BrookeHibbett

I haven't experienced any of the side effects it says you experience.",Anonymous
