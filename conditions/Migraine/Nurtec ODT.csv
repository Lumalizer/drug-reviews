1,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 24, 2022",0,"I took Nurtec for the first time yesterday, on my second day of a migraine at 2pm. I first felt pins and needles all over. My headache did go away after 30 minutes. However, an hour later, it returned with a vengeance, along with nausea and blurred vision. It’s now 7pm the following day and I still have what feels like a rebound headache and my vision is still blurry. I will not be using Nurtec again and will continue seeking  relief through hopefully more natural solutions—instead of all these medications with unbearable side effects.",HK78

4,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2022",0,"Do not recommend this medicine. I only wish I had known it had an artificial sweetener before taking it. It explains why my body reacted so violently. Sumatriptan works great to treat my migraines but my new neurologist was looking for a preventative solution. Apparently, Nurtec can be used that way, but first we needed to see how I’d react. Both times I took it at the onset of a migraine. The first time, I went straight to bed and woke up the next morning feeling slightly hungover. But then, nausea, diarrhea, and a weird headache for two days. Thought I’d give it one more try. Didn’t touch the headache and about 36 hours later, horrific rebound headache. I have been in bed all day. Do not wish this on anyone.",Anonymous

7,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 10, 2022",1,"I have had migraines my ENTIRE life. Seriously. I have vivid memories of throwing up at dinner when I was four. I have been on preventive medications; propranolol worked well but made me too tired, metoprolol made them worse, indomethacin did nothing, and periactin gave me too intense of nightmares to know if it worked or not. I do take sumatriptan, which does work for the most part, but I often have a lingering aching in the back of my head and they often come back within a few hours. Sometimes it doesn’t work at all. Tonight I tried the samples my neurologist gave me and I have NEVER recovered so quickly and to the degree that I did. Within 45 minutes I felt completely resurrected with just a mild soreness left over. With the intensity of the headache I had tonight, I expected to battle it for the next several days.",Lexi
8,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 9, 2022",0,I feel that this doesn’t really work any better than generic imatrex ( the brand name version works great). I get terrible auras to where I can’t focus on anything and there is crazy flashing lights before the migraine comes so I take the meds right away.   But the real problem is I get extreme indigestion  afterwards. The pain is so intense I was thinking about going to the ER. Finally after a double dose of Prilosec and several Pepcid complete it calmed down enough for me to sleep. The pain has remained for days afterward and I can barely eat anything without pain. Getting tested today to see if it’s something else but I’m convinced it was the Nurtec.,zuzulanky
9,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 9, 2022",0,"I have migraines that I am unsure of the source.  At times, they are cluster-like, other times tension, not all the time does it reach that migraine level, many times it's a bad headache.  I've tried all kinds of things, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety, Fiorecet, muscle relaxers, etc. During December 2021, I had a headache/migraine almost every single day of the month, which was awful.  Early January 2022, I was given Nurtec ODT samples at my Doctor's office.  I have found relief!  It was suggested I take them every other day which I was not keen on, however to live in pain is not best for me.  I have noticed early on that the headache was still there (like dull pressure lingering), that has subsided now but I notice a headache starting to come back if I don't dose within 48 hours.  I am worried some about the long-term impact but I don't know what else to do!  Also - I'm getting them through a specialty pharmacy at no cost currently and if this changes, I won't be able to afford it",Websterj

I am 69 years old, and have been getting migraines for approximately 35 years. I have tried every preventative medicine without results. I take maxalt. Sometimes I need to take second dose, but get relief.  I received a sample of nurtec to try. I took it at onset of evening migraine, with no relief. I actually had one of the worst migraines ever after taking it. Almost went to ER. Had my head wrapped in ice packs all night. After 12 hours I actually took another nurtec because I was afraid to mix nurtec with another med.  I know It is only to be taken once in 24 hours, but I wasn’t able to wait for 24 hours as recommended. The second dose did relieve the pain, without any side effects.

13,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 4, 2022",0,"Effective BUT costly and difficult to get.  My daughter was finally given Nurtec ODT for her migraines after exhausting many other medications.  It was life changing, as it is the ONLY thing that has worked so far.  Then insurance stopped covering, and denied all appeals.  Great med with little side affects for her, but unaffordable and 2 insurance companies denied coverage and appeals.  So it's back to square one. It's unfortunate that a company will make a medication that truly is life changing, and then make sure that so many people can't get it.  Who can afford almost $1000 a month for 4 pills?  Great that they use celebrities to advertise, who probably have no problem paying those prices, or get it for free as compensation for endorsement.",A mom

At first I didn't have many side effects, but over time I seemed to have more side effects each time I took it. I started to have terrible heartburn and bad stomach pains and my gut just felt horrible in general after taking only 1/2  pill. I also had severe tiredness, dyspnea, and I seriously would get a cold after each time taking it. Then recently I had a really stubborn migraine and took a few doses throughout the week trying to end the attack and suddenly it made my migraine MUCH worse and I had trouble breathing. I also developed SEVERE panic attacks and psychosis!..then I ended up in the ER with a hypertensive crisis. My BP was out of control and not going down (165/115). Got treatment for that but it took weeks to feel completely normal again. This was among the most terrifying experiences of my life. Use with caution!

And they were bad, all day in bed, vomiting, pounding head, sensitivity to light and smell. Even moving was hard. I went to my pcp and told her I wanted to try this med if she agreed and she did. She said it's usually not covered by insurance though and every time she prescribed it no patients were able to actually get it so I didn't have my hopes up. But I went online and downloaded the 0$ copay card and to my surprise at the pharmacy they apparently had used their own for me and it was 0$. I had a migraine that day but it wasn't as severe I had the pain in head and eye and nausea. I came home and took the med and was still pretty nauseous but to my surprise about an hour later I felt all better. I thought it was a fluke.

19,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2022",1,"Initially, my experience was good. My doctor had me taking it every other day as a preventative. My doctor has me taking Nurtec every other day. The first 8 days were good. Since then it's been downhill. I've had about half the number of migraines and it takes one Maxalt, as opposed to two. Unfortunately, the cost of this drug makes my experience unacceptable. When you're paying nearly $1,000 a month for a medication, plus you're paying for regular migraine meds, it's not worth it. My doctor said this drug is a game changer but it's not. According to drugs.com, ""Nurtec ODT has an average rating of 4.9 out of 10 from a total of 112 ratings for the treatment of migraine headaches. 36% of reviewers reported a positive effect, while 48% reported a negative effect.""Not what I call a game changer.",Miraclepuppy

23,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2021",1,"1st use caused a panic attack (PA).  I was desperate so I took it before doing my normal research, but I started research shortly after taking it.  The first thing I saw was a Kardashian name.  I wouldn’t have taken it had I seen that first as I feel it speaks volumes.  The PA that this set off rolled for hours.  Also, I now know (thanks to research) the CGRP is involved in wound healing and protective measures for the cardiovascular system among other things.  I don’t trust the longterm safety of this drug.  I’ve never had a reaction like this to a drug and haven’t had enough PAs for me to think that the PA was a coincidence.  This drug is the only known trigger for my PAs.

For reference I'm a 21 year old female and was so excited to finally get a prescription for this after researching it and besides migraines I do not have any other health issues. I took this pill around 9 in the morning for my first time when I felt a migraine approaching. Less than about 7 minutes later, I was vomiting an insane amount. This continued for upwards of 15 hours, along with: full body shakes, extremely cold, extremely weak, trouble walking. I literally needed assistance putting on clothes and standing up w/o fainting. I have NEVER felt this way before in my entire life. It was like a mixture between alcohol poisoning and food poisoning except the only things in my body were Nurtec and my morning cereal.

I'm going to try Nurtec for at least a month or two before I give it a failing grade; however, I just finished my first two week (8 tablets of one every other day) regimen and I was wildly disappointed. Not only has it done a poor job (so far) of treating/preventing migraines, I feel like one time it actually gave me a migraine. In theory, it sounds like the perfect CGRP antagonist medication. And maybe I have to give it more time. But so far, I'm having to rely on my Imitrex. It feels like it's back to the drawing board. : (I don't know how to rate this on a scale of 1 to 10.

36,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,1.0,,"October 3, 2021",2,I tried Nurtec in March of 2021. I didn’t link it to the Nurtec right away but soon after I started experiencing joint pain in my thumb joints. Then after the first couple doses I noticed the joint pain in hips and neck. After taking the 5th and final dose my hand joints were throbbing. I could not even touch my hands they hurt so bad. Also I could hardly turn my neck and walking was a challenge. Finally it hit me that it has to be the Nurtec. I did nothing else. Took nothing else and it started right after starting the Nurtec. I went to my GP and he also thinks it is from the that. The problem is that it wasn’t going away after I stopped it. So I was put on prednisone which helps tremendously. But as soon as I stop or try to wean off it it returns with a vengeance. I am negative for all Rheumatoid arthritis tests including a genetic one. Never had joint pain prior to this.

A lot of the acute medications I’ve tried have worked only partially, half of the time, not at all, or have side effects that are comparable to the migraine. I can only use Phenergan and Aleve, 3-4 times a week combined, so I’m often left stranded in a bad week. I also get nerve block injections every 3 months. However, Nurtec works every time, beautifully. It takes at least 45 minutes to kick in, but it finishes the headache 90% of the time.

For a short period of time I help them back with a ketogenic diet which was difficult to maintain while caring for my ageing parents as they passed. A year ago my neurologist suggested Ubrelvy so I researched it and learned about in Nurtec. I asked for prescriptions for both So that I could compare them. Both work in my case. Ubrelvy is harder on my system, So I take only half a pill and I only use it for when I get a migraine in the middle of the night. Nurtec on the other hand has been a godsend to me.

49,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 20, 2021",2,Works well for me. I don't want to say its a miracle drug but it kinda is for me. It does target the headaches and migraines well. Within 1 hour first time taking the medication it was strange it pushed the headache behind my eyes. The pain migrated and then started to dissipate almost like it was pushing it out of my head. Then it was gone entirely. I haven't had anymore head pain since taking this for them. It hasn't had any drowsy effect on me personally and I'm wide awake. No nausea from the pill itself which is great. Taste is okay its not horrible compared to other medications I take daily so thats a plus. Dissolves pretty quickly. Only side effect I noticed is mild eye twitching. Or a type of pulsating. I wasn't having this before starting Nurtec ODT. It started the second dose and has occurred every time after when taking. Its fine ill take that over the headaches and migraines that were debilitating.,Momof1

The headache went away in 2 hours but I was left with the feeling of a 10 ton weight in my head for the next 18 hours and the brain fog that usually accompanies my migraines became 10 times worse and lasted for 8 days!  On the positive side I did not have another migraine for over a month, when I normally would have had at least one a week.  This is why I gave it a 3.

It also gives me terrible heartburn and sharp pains in my stomach and gut as well as some stiffness and joint pain so I'm starting to wonder how safe it is, especially in the long term.

If pain returns sooner than 24 hours later then maybe stick with triptans.(I'm also taking Aimovig 140 so I shouldn't be getting any of these dagnabbed headaches at all.)And I agree that the packaging is insanely wasteful and also rather difficult.

Yesterday I received my prescription of nurtec and took my first dose of it right away since I had taken a triptan the night before and it hadn't helped yet. I didn't have much relief at all with that dose.  It may be because it wasn't technically taken at the onset of that migraine. I'm not sure.  I ended up sleeping most of the day today.( Its now 630 pm and I've been ""awake"" for a little over an hour) I had no migraine upon waking up but shortly after I did notice I was beginning to have a migraine. I did take another dose of nurtec. And I can say, I'm feeling no symptoms in less than an hour after taking it. Fingers crossed that this med will be the one to work. With having 2 different experiences, I'll make sure to come back and update my review or leave another after I've finished this first pack",Butterflymom
100,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,2.0,,"December 14, 2020",22,"It’s didn’t work for me at all. I took a sample from my neurologist. I got a sample with 2 doses I took 1 pill one day and the next day the other other one. I get severe migraines. I get Botox injections once every 3 months take topomax, depekote and tizanidine as needed. Nurtec is easy to take but it didn’t do anything for me. Also this medication is extremely expensive",Aurora
101,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 12, 2020",21,"Not a long time Migraine sufferer but have had headaches my entire life (I am 33). This year has been horrible for migraines. I originally tried sumatriptan but doctor said Nurtec has less side effects. So far it has taken the migraine away in about 30 minutes - 60 minutes. However, about 2-3 hours in, I get caught with a giant bout of fatigue. The kind where you can't keep your eyes open. Fatigue seems to be a common side effect for me but some medicines less than others. Good luck.",KelBel

103,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,3.0,,"December 6, 2020",25,"I was very hopeful Nurtec ODT would be an effective addition to the Botox for treatments I already receive. As I have been a migraine sufferer since childhood and have had minimal relief. Unfortunately, I experienced more side effects than what are listed. 1 hour after taking it, I developed slight nausea with significant reflux. I was delayed, light headed, under the influence and could hear/feel my heartbeat loudly. I took it during my workday and had to get a ride home since I did not feel clear enough to drive myself. My headache remained and I felt so stoned, that I went to bed at 8 pm and slept solid until 4 am. Awoke still w/headache, but no longer stoned. I spoke with my neurologist and explained my experience. He has advised me to discontinue use. I feel they should include a warning not to drive or operate heavy machinery until you know how it affects you.",Punkin

I think it helps head it off but I also take 2.5 mg codeine so don't know if it's the codeine or the Nurtec. I don't think it's worth 90 bucks a pill....,Janam
106,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 9, 2020",30,"I have used this 3 times. The first two times it worked really well for menstrual related headaches. No rebound, no side effects. The third time, I got dehydrated and it turned into a migraine I think I took it too late because I thought rehydrating would make the headache go away. It worked, but took much longer. It took the edge off after 30 minutes, but the headache did not go away completely for about 6 hours.I am using samples given by my doctor. The packaging is really ridiculous. Way over the top and too much waste and frustration trying to get to 2 little pills. Please be more eco-conscious. You should be ashamed of this.",arbie88

108,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,10.0,,"October 27, 2020",31,This works great for me! I am unable to tolerate triptans and topomax so they did not work for me. Aimovig injections helped but after a year I started getting more migraines again. So then I tried nurtec and it helps stop my migraines. In the past my migraines would last 2-3 days but with this new medication they are gone the same day!,Cate

It says to take it at the onset so I was uncertain of the effectiveness of taking it mid, fully established migraine.  I was pleased to have the headache gone quickly with no side effects (I was tired and took a nap, but that might just have been 'Saturday Syndrome').It's Sunday now, my weather trigger is still present, but I'm feeling pretty good - perhaps a little stiff at the base of my skull, but nothing I can't easily ignore.Happy with the medication. Thrilled with the $0 copay offer.  Very concerned about being able to afford once that offer expires.",Anne

Last night I took it for the 3rd time. I got a really bad migraine  And needed to take a cocktail to be able to sleep. This morning when my husband took my blood pressure it was 155/110.

112,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,2.0,,"October 17, 2020",17,"Nurtec ODT does not work on Excedrin rebound / medication overuse headaches.  I took one Nurtec ODT 12 hours ago and it maybe dented the pain slightly, temporarily.  No nausea.  I either have a migraine, a headache or an Excedrin rebound headache.  The over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever Excedrin combines caffeine 65mg/caplet aspirin 250mg/ caplet and acetaminophen 250mg/ caplet.My habit is currently 3 Excedrin per day.  I take an Aimovig shot 1x per month which helped the first 2 months with many Excedrin and pain free days.I took Imitrex 2x in 24 hrs yesterday and it reduced the pain level and put me to sleep but did not work very long.  When I could feel the Imitrex wearing off I took the Nurtec.  Nurtec, Aimovig and Imitrex and the migraine is still there.

113,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 14, 2020",11,Wonderful drug Nurtec gets rid of my migraines in one hour or less though I had one where it took a bit longer than an hour more like two for it to go away. Either way wonderful drug and the only migraine abortive that has worked for my migraines. Sumatriptan was a hit and miss all the time and Rizatriptan was horrible made my light sensitivity even worse and made my brain feel like it was going to explode.,SphereR
114,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 10, 2020",66,"This is the only drug that's actually worked for my chronic migraines. I also use neurobotox as a preventative, but it hasn't been preventing much lately.  I get occipital migraines that last 3 days constantly.  They come with nausea and hypersensitivity to light and computer screens, which is debilitating since I work in an office setting.  I started nurtec in February and it's saving my life right now.  One pill lasts 2 days, and it destroys the migraine and the nausea. It always takes 40-45 minutes to kick in. My migraines tend to come on in the night,  so as soon as I wake up with one,  I take a nurtec and wake feeling better.  These are keeping me functional since my migraines have been so much worse this year.",DrB

119,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,2.0,,"September 17, 2020",16,"Yesterday was my first time taking Nurtec ODT (that 2 dose sample pack), so I set a timer to track when (if) relief and/or side effects kicked in. 10 minutes after taking it, I almost threw up into the trash can in my office. I took 2 Zofran (for nausea), & they brought me from gagging to queasy enough to be miserable but not enough to be physically sick.There was some relief from the migraine itself about 30 more minutes later; the heavy throbbing in my head came down to an ache instead. I still received all the same sharp stabbing pains, though. At about 4-5 hours later, my headache was completely gone, though that long after the fact I question if it was the medicine or not.I've just taken the 2nd dose now, chasing it immediately with my zofran instead of waiting & eating starlight peppermints to try to control the nausea. We'll see how it does this 2nd dose.Over all, I highly doubt I'll get my GP to write an actual prescription for this, even with the discount card to counter the costs.",Brenna

Actually, my,lips and tongue felt as if they had been sprinkled with,cayenne pepper, but never swelled. Then, the metallic taste came on. Everything I tried to eat tasted horrible. After that, the stomach cramps and pooping began. Beware of this medicine. Maybe it will work for you, but I had a bad experience and will not use again.",mdb1968

The worst part of this is my migraine isn’t even all the way gone! It is definitely diminished but not gone. I have never written a review on here but this has been such an awful reaction I knew I had to. I will never take this again.

It takes about an hour to be effective enough that I can tell I still have a migraine slightly but there isn't pain. I haven't noticed any side effects which is pretty strange for me.

The nausea was so severe I was unable to function for the entire time. The nausea lead to vomiting with lasted 2 hours but it didn't relieve the nausea.  Zofran also did not relieve the nausea, and then my doctor called in Reglan, which seemed to help.  Nausea is a known side effect of Nurtec but certainly I do not think anyone would expect this kind of toxic reaction.  Be careful with this medication.",CJ-LA
133,Nurtec ODT,Migraine,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 17, 2020",24,"My migraines are strictly hormonal. I get migraines every day for one week straight during my time of the month.  I take sumatriptan injections when they’re unbearable and that works great, it just knocks me out and I can’t really function all too well.  I was excited to try Nurtec because it’s not supposed to make you drowsy, and it doesn’t.  It just didn’t work for me. I will say however, if I take it early enough - it keeps my migraine at bay (after 1-2 hours) but it doesn’t take it away completely like the sumatriptan injection does.  Unfortunately, the Nurtec barely did a thing for my full blown migraines.  I’ll stick with my injections. It’s not fun sticking my thigh but at least I get relief in just 10 minutes.",DianeL
