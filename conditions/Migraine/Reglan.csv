1,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 24, 2022",0,"Man do I wish I looked it up on here before the doctor just gave it to me for a terrible migraine. I also got the migraine cocktail but the doctor never mentioned to me that it could cause the feeling I was about to have.  One of the worst feelings in the world, like your skin is crawling and a terrible anxiety attack with it.  Wanted to rip the IV out and run out of the hospital type feeling . I definitely do not recommend Reglan!! Worst experience at hospital I’ve ever had.",Zach123
2,Reglan,Migraine,,,"January 30, 2022",0,"I had the most horrendous experience with Reglan for migraine. I’ve never had a migraine bad enough to go to the ER, but I couldn’t kick this one. I wish I was well enough to look up each ingredient before I let them administer the drugs to me. The second I received the Reglan dose I immediately felt a crushing, awful, crawling out of my skin weird feeling. I had to pull my mask down and started having a panic attack. Reality felt completely warped. I wanted to pull the IV out, I couldn’t hold still, even though they told me that holding still would make it go away faster: umm, not true. No one told me the potential side effects of this medication. I felt like I was dying, my legs were shaking, I was so restless and hopeless. The nurses kept saying it would go away after a few minutes, of course it didn’t. After 30 mins of this nightmare they finally gave me Ativan for anxiety and it helped. Stay away from Reglan!",No to Reglan
3,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 25, 2022",0,"Went to urgent care last night after having a migraine for 4 days, they immediately give me a migraine cocktail including Reglan. I will say the cocktail knocked out the migraine very quickly, but almost as quickly I got a horrible feeling of anxiety/doom/like I HAD to get out of there NOW. I wanted to crawl out of my own skin. I probably should have said something to the doctor but I just wanted to leave so badly that I didn't say anything. Exactly like others have described, I was incredible anxious, felt like I needed to get up and run, couldn't hold still. I'm here at home the next day and the side effects still haven't worn off, I'm hoping they will soon because this is miserable. However, I will say the migraine cocktail worked like a charm on the headache itself, and I'm incredibly grateful for that.",icybabe
4,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,,"December 7, 2021",0,"PLEASE do NOT take Reglan. I am posting this experience from over 4 years ago from my reaction to reglan..that’s how impactful my reaction was to me. I suffer from migraines and I go to the ER whenever it’s really bad. I happened to go to a new hospital one night because I was out of town when a migraine hit me. They gave me some sort of migraine cocktail but with Reglan (which I’ve never had before). As soon as it was pushed through the IV I IMMEDIATELY started coughing uncontrollably, felt a cold rush going down my throat and extreme weight on my chest. I then began to hallucinate while looking around the room I felt like I was going insane. When I looked at the door in front of me all I could see were swirls just everywhere I can’t even explain what I was seeing. My whole body started to shake uncontrollably only letting up for a few seconds before starting again. I then had extreme memory loss when asked simple questions from the techs!! I am scarred for life",Gabriella
5,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2021",6,"11/2/21I had a terrible migraine went to ER they gave me a  cocktail for Migraines. I wasn’t told the side effects. As soon as the Teglan, Benadryl, Toradol was put in my IV …It was the worst anxiety I’ve ever felt. I instantly wanted it out of my system. A day later and still anxious. I would rather have a terrible headache than those meds any day.",Cassie
6,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 24, 2021",2,"like everyone else mentions, DO NOT accept for migraine treatment!! They will tell you they're giving you a migraine cocktail (benadryl, reglan, toradol) I have anxiety & am prone to anxiety/ panic attacks, it induced the worst anxiety attack I have ever had. Sharing this because I started shaking uncontrollably, I almost pulled the needle out of my arm, I couldn't walk when they asked me to get up for my brain scan. When I told the staff I was starting to feel anxious, they said ""yeah you'll feel funny"" which is quite the understatement... I wanted to scream. I couldn't hold my arms out in front of me for the neuro exam (I had been having migraines for a week straight so I expressed my neuro concerns) Thankfully I survived but I am genuinely traumatized.",ash
7,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 14, 2021",2,"Same as the other bad reviews. Impulse to rip out IV and run. Restless but had to stay in hospital bed. Flighty, uncomfortable. Worst than the migraine. I am bipolar and on meds and they gave it to me anyway. After getting it I remembered that I had that experience before once. I put it on my list of allergies now. NEVER AGAIN. Luckily only lasted about an hour. Worst hour of my life.",Migraine suffer
8,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,,"August 10, 2021",2,"I am 23 years old & I've been suffering with migraines almost my whole life. Several times I’ve gone to the ER because of the severe pain from migraines that would not go away. Every time I go to the ER & get the cocktail I always tell the nurses to not give me Reglan. And guess what?? They still give it to me! Reglan makes me feel like I am losing my sanity. I feel the reaction as soon as it goes through the IV! I cannot keep still, I feel the urge to just run out of the hospital or even jump out of a window. My last dose of reglan was so bad I didn’t even finish the IV fluids, I asked to get discharged immediately! That drug needs to be banned from society!",Layla
9,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,,"May 22, 2021",8,"I suffer from hemiplegic migraines and had a very bad attack yesterday late morning. I went to the hospital where I was given IV push of Benadryl, Toradol, and Reglan. As soon as she started the IV and walked out of the room I had a horrible feeling come over my whole body. My legs felt like they were on fire and I felt as if I was going crazy. I tried to relax and shake it off but the feeling wouldn’t go away and I became dizzy and almost delusional. I called my wife to tell her what was going on and she told me to hit the call button so I called the nurse back in and told her how I was feeling and she said the Reglan has that affect on some people. She pushed Ativan to counteract it. It was a scary feeling",Kaleblee22
10,Reglan,Migraine,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 17, 2021",9,"I shared the same feeling of panic after receiving an IV push of Reglan.  I never had panic disorder before, but now I can’t get rid of it.  I really want to get the COVID vaccine but this experience is really making me nervous.  Has anyone else who had this reaction received if?",eharvell
11,Reglan,Migraine,,,"April 9, 2021",2,"This knocks out my migraine pain very quickly.  As others mentioned,  it causes extreme restlessness and anxiety.  Request Ativan and benadryl for the uncomfortable symptoms and it works very quickly.",Heather

13,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,,"March 12, 2021",3,"Given in IV emergency room for headache. Not aware of the medicine nor explained to me, I was left in a hallway awaiting imaging. My body's immediate response to Reglan was something moving in my veins and crazy urge to get out! My head and thoughts were no longer mine. This was not the worst part. The worst part is that they didn't tell me what medicine I was given nor explained that this was a ""normal"" thing that this med does. The most horrible thing is that this has been years ago, and I still live with panic and anxiety since. No longer trusting my mind or body, afraid to drive, can't be left alone, some days are ok, but I'm not the same person anymore.",Mee
14,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,,"March 9, 2021",0,"Went to ER for a horrible migraine that would not go away. Doctor gave me a migraine cocktail and Reglan was part of it. THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE! I honestly feel like I have some PTSD symptoms from this experience. Gave me through IV and instantly started to have a panic attack. I felt so restless like my bones wanted to jump out of my skin, couldn’t get comfortable, had to repeatedly get out of my bed and pace the room, this combined with dizziness was horrible. My heart rate also sky rocketed to 140 and stayed until that range all night according to my fitbit. Two weeks after the ER visit, every time I stood up or did any type of activity my heart would go to 160-180. I ended up back in ER 4 times after this experience because of my heart . I’ve never had heart problems before taking this medication!!!!!!!!!! It took around 2 months for me to start to feel normal again.",Anonymous
15,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,,"February 16, 2021",8,"This is a 21 month update about my experience with Reglan IV, a one time dose given as a ""migraine cocktail"" in the ER for a migraine. Yep, in just 3 months it will be two years since I have gotten this awful medication. I STILL have issues from what Reglan did to me. It is not uncommon for people to have tardive dyskinesia or akathasia from Reglan. I got akasthasia. For many the symptoms of akathasia go away in an hour or a few days. (Tardive dyskinesia on the other hand, can be permanent. In fact, like I said I got akathasia, not tardive dyskinesia.) Anyway, in many cases the akathasia subsides. But, it can hang on for some. I was one of those unfortunate people. There is a support group on Facebook called the Reglan Support Group for people who have had a harder time recovering from the injury of this drug. I had acute symptoms for 4 months. It was as bad as people describe akathasia on here. The next several months the symptoms were moderate. This drug had destroyed my life.",Miss Fortitude
16,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 10, 2021",42,"Worst experience of my life, it was almost fatal. Literally my nurse began crying as I was in and out. I suffer PTSD now because of this experience and am scared to go to the hospital, take medications , and especially the ER. Went in for a headache that was persistent, no other symptoms, healthy young 23 year old and had such a bad reaction from injecting this stuff into my veins within 10 minutes of showing up. Makes you question their practice and intentions. .",Carolina
17,Reglan,Migraine,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2021",0,"I was given this for a CT scan.  As a great side effect it worked extremely well for acute, long-lasting migraine episode for me. People are correct that the psychological side effects are extremely unpleasant but I believe that for me Reglan stopped a months, possibly years, long migraine cycle. I think Reglan is a miracle drug. It is nice to know that it exists.The side effects were as bad as people are describing - within about 5 minutes of coming back from the CT I told the aid that I had to leave the building due to being extremely anxious and restless. If you have intractable migraine and are in the ER and have not ruled it out, I would advise to give it a shot.",tmc
18,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,,"October 30, 2020",103,"DO NOT TAKE IT THIS MEDICATION!!! The doctors gave me this medication without explaining to me the common side effect of basically going insane for a short period of time. They just told me I would feel a weird for a little bit and then it would go away. They didn’t even ask me if I had a history of mental illness. I was expecting for me to feel drowsy or sleepy or a bit off, because that’s what feeling weird is supposed to feel like. But no!!! I suffered temporary insanity!!! Extreme derealization, depersonalization, depression, hopelessness, my life felt meaningless, I felt like I was dying and kept thinking about how I did not want to die!!! I felt doomed!!! I wanted to jump out of my skin and run out of the hospital!!!! I was about to rip the IV off my arm. Tremendous emotional despair and near death experience!!! It was a nightmare while being awake!! I much rather have the migraine!!!",Millie
19,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,,"October 11, 2020",9,"Went to the ER with severe migraine headache, dizziness and nausea.  Was given cocktail of Reglan and Benadryl and was told by ER doctor it would help with both headache and dizziness.  Didn’t help at all and made me feel extremely  anxious.  Then was given aDifferent drug (don’t recall the name) combined with magnesium. Again no relief at all.  Then I asked to please remove IV so I could go home, feeling same or worse than before these drugs.  I have only been to the ER three times in my life (I’m in my 60’s)so I’m not too familiar with ER protocol.Would not allow this drug in my body again.Going to neurologist tomorrow.",anonymous
20,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,,"May 20, 2020",52,"I went to the ER for a migraine. They gave me a migraine concoction and after they put it in my IV I started having the scariest panic attack of my life. I suffer with anxiety disorder and panic attacks, but never this extreme. I kept feeling as if I was dying and I kept telling the nurse I don’t  want to die. I could not shake the feeling or calm down no matter how hard I tried and was extremely drugged . They gave me a whole bunch of Benadryl to counteract and told me it has anxiety inducing reactions on some people! I told them before they administered that I have an anxiety disorder and they still gave it to me! It took me almost an hour to calm down! I do not recommend it!",Jenna
21,Reglan,Migraine,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 3, 2020",4,They gave me a migraine cocktail as well and the ER with relgan and benadryl and I was fine at first.  Then when I went home it started my jaw felt like it was swollen and I bleed for days when I use the bathroom and lost weight it do feels like so wrong with you and they need to take thus medicine off the market for sure. I had to warm up some Pedialyte and drink it just to get some electrolyte back and me and my throat feels like its on fire. Next time I will search the side effects why and hospital and read people respond to the medicine.,Anonymous
22,Reglan,Migraine,7.0,,"May 2, 2020",4,"I have about 15 migraines/months with status migraine at least once per season.  This is actually an improvement from daily incapacitating migraines. There are a lot of empty promises/side effects w/ migraine drugs and often not a lot of relief. Reglan for me was OK for me. I did not get a ton of side effects, but  I found that it does help me break status migraine at home after I found it effective with the Migraine Cocktail in the ER. It's not the immediate ""out of migraine now"" feeling. I find that after I take 3 or 4 doses my migraines taper off out of status within a few (2-3) days. I hate the ER- but I like to incorporate successes in my at home routine after discussing with my neuro. I know that feeling of wanting to rip out the IV. I'd check to see if it was being pushed with a steroid.  If you had a rough time in the ER but it broke your migraine cycle ,I'd talk to your doc about incorporating this in your migraine relief toolbox. It's not perfect but worth a shot.",Sarah H
23,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 7, 2020",38,"I went to the ER with a migraine so bad I couldn't even walk. I got hooked up to an IV that gave me the migraine cocktail (reglan, benadryl). I felt the most terrible anxiety I have ever felt in my life. I felt like I was trapped. I kept twitching and fixating on the IV in my arm. I begged and begged and begged for them to take it out. I was prescribed reglan alone to take when my migraines got bad again. I didn't know it was the reglan that made me feel this way at first so I started taking it when I felt a migraine coming on. I will never take this medication again. It is the most terrible feeling in the world. Your heart races and you feel like you're being held down, like you are being put in a near death scenario. I hate you reglan!!",han
24,Reglan,Migraine,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2020",22,I am so relieved to find out that it I am not alone with these reactions to Reglan. I had a similar reaction once before so this time I begged them not to give me the Reglan but they reassured me the medication wasn’t the issue.  I pulled out my IV and checked myself out. Why isn’t this kind of reaction known of in the ER?,Rere
25,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,,"January 31, 2020",22,Had headache for 4 weeks. Very severe. Tried everything OTC. Went to ER. Dr gave migraine cocktail with Reglan and Benadryl. I weigh 130 5’6. I immediately started feeling ridiculous anxiety shaking uncontrollable. Short of breath feeling like I was going to pass out and my heart rate was dropping. I felt like I was going to die. I couldn’t even talk to my husband on the phone. Wanted to rip out the IV. I actually stopped the IV and hit button for  help. They had closed the door and I get like severe  panic. Once the IV was done they gave me Valium which helped a little sent me home. Still had the headache slightly. Have some  side effects in the evening and now today. How long does it take to wear off. Awful awful experience,Sally
26,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 15, 2020",69,"Ok my experience is Just the same as everybody’s else’s in this site. I went to the hospital for some stomach pain and they gave me Reglan from the IV. I got paralyzed all my arm and body I couldn’t  move I couldn’t talk. I just wanted to scream I felt like I was dying , I never had a panic attack in my whole life until that moment. I couldn’t breath I couldn’t  dial my  husbands phone number to tell him that I thought it was the end of me, that’s how bad it was I felt. It was like I was really passing out  and my heart was coming out of my chest. This happened about 4 month ago. Now the problem is that since then I have all most everyday anxiety for no reasons, panic attacks for no reason I feel agitated and always have the fear that something is wrong with me and afraid I may pass away and leave my kids behind. Did any of you experience the same thing as I am and can’t get out of this anxiety?? Please send me some answers if the side affects persists for a long time what can I do to go back to normal life again??",Jacky

Nurse asks if I want something for headache.  Reglan.  ""Yes"" with out me asking about the side effects!   She also insisted on a full bag of saline.  I tried but then tore off finger thing, couldn't tear out IV.  Nurse turns out my lights, closes door and goes away while I complain of severe stomach distress, in most uncomfortable position ever without a way of calling for help.  20 min. later she peeks in, I scream to take my IV out!I leave without my reports.

I have gotten Toradol shots for my migraines over the last couple of weeks with absolutely no problem whatsoever. I also have never had an adverse reaction to Benadryl in my life. So I know the Reglan is to blame. Within 5 minutes of this drug polluting my veins i felt an insanely strong urge to rip My IV out of my arm, I got extremely restless, like I had to keep moving, I felt like I needed to leave the hospital immediately, and was in a total panic. I couldn’t sit still, I just felt like something terrible was happening. This drug definitely induced an anxiety, or some sort of panic attack. I do not recommend this at all.",Sam
30,Reglan,Migraine,2.0,,"October 27, 2019",8,"I went to the E.D. 2 nights ago for a massive headache, worst headache I have ever had in my life and I was miserable and dry heaving. When I finally got pulled back they gave me the ""headache cocktail"" with Reglan, Benadryl and Toradol. The nurse started taking the blood pressure in the same arm as my IV. While it was squeezing my arm it was shooting pain in my arm. The fluids were painful in my arm and I kept begging for them to take them out. I had a massive panic attack and couldn't keep my legs still. I started feeling like I needed to get out of my own skin and my clothes were strangling me. I started begging for them to let me leave because I HAD TO go. It took about 30-45 min for me to actually calm down, my headache went away, but I freaked out both my mom and my boyfriend. It was one of the worst experiences of my life while I was leaving the dr was like ""oh, yeah one of the medicines can wind you up and give you anxiety like that"".

The doctor decides to give me a Benadryl and a shot of reglan. 3 to 5 minutes after the reglan has set in ( I know it was the reglan because I take Benadryl no problem) I go into a full blown panic attack. I have this complete sense of dread, I felt as though if I didn't get out of my own skin, or just that hospital, I felt I was going to die then and there. I honestly don't think actually dying will be as bad a feeling as this. I ripped out my IV, there was blood flinging everywhere along with the fluids that were dripping in. The doctor runs in yells at me then goes out and slams the door behind him. Which totally intensified my panic and I ran out of the hospital. The whole way home I just kept thinking I wouldn't survive to see my kids again.  It felt like an hour drive and it was literally 5 minutes. Never again.",Danielle

45,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,,"June 5, 2019",8,"Omg worst medicine mixture ever!!! I’ve had this terrible stuff 2 times. The first time I went to the ER for an awful migraine and they gave me compazine, Reglan and Benadryl and immediately I started feeling very tired but restless and anxious at the same time. I wanted to sleep but I couldn’t because I felt like I just wanted to run out of there and just go home! It’s the worse anxious feeling I’ve ever experienced. So the next time I had a migraine they wanted to give me that and I thought well maybe it was just a bad reaction last time or something but NOPE! I had the same feeling and they wanted to do an MRI on me because of other neurological symptoms I came in with but since I was feeling so awful I just told them nope I want to be discharged.

47,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,,"February 27, 2019",11,"I was in ER last night for severe migraine attack. The doctor asked what I normally get and that's toradol, zofran, and steroid through IV. They come in with this toradol, reglan, benadryl mix. Literally 2 min after meds were administered I felt the need to jump out the bed and just go home. I was burning up inside, restless, and still had the headache. So when I see other people posting almost the exact same thing, I totally get it. The national headache society did a study, benadryl is actually one of the drugs NOT recommended to treat migraines. I was told Reglan treated the ""pain"". Nope, it actually just controls the nausea by getting your stomach to empty / process the contents faster. I had the same migraine when I woke up. Now the toradol I know helped, it usually does to some degree. But getting a steroid shot / injection is usually what keeps the migraine from returning. Personally, I just don't think the doctor had a lot of knowledge regarding treatment of migraines.",Same

I had to be picked up from work & brought back to urgent care.  Got to urgent care and they gave me ativan and said I had an anxiety attack.  The only thing that was different in my body/life was the fact that my migraine was now gone & was treated with those drugs. I'm not totally discounting the fact that I had an anxiety attack.

Within minutes I was shaking violently and couldn't control it. It made me so nauseated. I thought I was going to either have a seizure or a heart attack! It didn't give me any relief at all- not even sleepy. After several unsuccessful pages to anesthesia for a blood patch, I said I had enough and wanted out of there (after more than 6 hours in the ER).",No way!

I could not lift my head or turn myself over.  I felt limp as if I were a rag doll .  I thought that I was dying and kept asking my husband to pray for me and call my pastor.

91,Reglan,Migraine,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 11, 2016",34,"Anytime you go into an ER with a migraine the doc will automatically try an avoid real meds and instead says we're gonna try reglan which has a sedative effect and then add Benadryl and knock you out, turn off the lights and close the door for Dark and quiet. Good thing for any kind of headache. About thirty minutes later the doctor rushes in flips on the light and says how's the headache? At thirty minutes of sleeping your just starting to hit REM. You're groggy from the sedative effects therefore not thinking clearly so you answer like um ok I guess. ""Great lets get you outa here."" On the way out as you're waking up you realize the pain is still there but too late. Reglan is great for the Doctors but does nothing for the patient.",Rwd681

I had the same experience as others with the anxiety, wanting to crawl out of my skin feeling. I had the Benadryl as well, but it didn't help.

I literally could not lie in the bed - I was pacing around the hospital room,  and actually had to jump up and down because I was so restless.
