0,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 28, 2021",0,"So… It definitely helps the migraines, HOWEVER, it makes my throat, tongue, neck and upper back tense up? I am grateful that it takes away the pain of how intense my migraines get, so it definitely gets a 10 for that. I’m just scared of overusing it, I have a tendency to get horribly bad rebound headaches. I try to take them not so close together and when I REALLY feel like I need to. Also, my insurance will only cover 6 at a time… Annoying. Overall, I think these are worth it to at least try. The side effects are kind of annoying, but seem to wear off 1-3 hours in.",kd5192
1,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 23, 2021",0,Zomig (zolmitriptan):Zomig is a miracle drug.   I get migraines several times a week. I take this at the very first hint of a headache and it aborts the headache.   It makes you feel completely normal.  The first 45 minutes my heart beats a little fast but that goes away quickly.   Highly recommend.,Mary
2,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 7, 2021",0,"Zomig (zolmitriptan):First time trying this medication for my migraines and the experience was horrifying.I did as the pharmacist told me as in when I felt the pain starting to take my first tablet right away. So I did and after about an hour the migraine was getting worse so I waited the 2 hours in order to take my second tablet because the pain was only getting worse for me with some added nausea. Hoping for relief I took the second dose and oh my what a bad idea. After just about 1/2 an hour the pain intensified. My head felt like it was going to burst, my vision was not blurred but if I looked at something it was bobbing. I had to ice my head constantly and anything I laid on felt so hard and made everything hurt. I could barely sleep because the pain was throbbing so bad and was getting even more nauseous. So needless to say I had a terrible night still woke up with a pounding head and will NEVER take another dose of this medication. I will be going to my doctor do a different prescription.",Sasha
3,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 30, 2021",0,"Zolmitriptan consistently works for me in stopping a migraine in its tracks and most of the time they don't recur which is fantastic.  As with all triptans, it can have some strange and what feel like scary side effects (chest pressure/tightness, muscle cramps and stiffness, dizziness, drowsiness, weird bodily sensations, euphoria, dysphoria, feelings of hot and cold skin) but they are usually transient and short-lived.  I've also tried rizatriptan and sumatriptan.  The effectiveness is about the same, but for me, zolmitriptan has the fewest of these side effects compared to those.  Small price to pay for migraine relief I can count on every time.  A low dose of 1.25mg or 2.5mg works for me.  I also take an antidepressant (Viibryd) and have not experienced any problems or serious interactions.",Anonymous
4,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,10.0,,"July 10, 2021",0,Zomig Nasal Spray (zolmitriptan):I've been taking zomig since 2017 as I suffer from migraines since I was 15 years old. I am now 32 years old and the attacks have increased and worsened. I've been taking for so many years painkillers but the headache hasn’t stopped.  Since I've started on Zomig nasal spray it’s been a life saver for me. If I didn't have the zomig I don’t know what I will do. The headache will disappear within 20 minutes,Enejda
5,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,4.0,,"March 21, 2021",0,"It works but has strange side effects.  For me it takes about 10-15 minutes to start working and then slowly makes me a bit light headed.  Seems to induce some eczema on face after too. A bit stronger case than any other triptan.  It does sort of puts a stop to the migraine but doesn't eliminate it.  After 2-3 hours I get this momentary forehead pain (5-10) seconds like I've been hit by a train.  Then it passes.  Personally, I recommend Sumatriptan. It's a bit weaker but works more effectively with fewer side effects.",Ken
6,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9.0,,"March 11, 2021",5,"Zomig (zolmitriptan):I have been using Zomig for several years.  I usually get some minor body aches from it.  But, I find the side effects worsen if you are not active.  I know with a migraine most people do not like to move or walk or exercise, but this is a must to avoid the cold shakes and flu-like symptoms.  This med constricts your blood vessels and to cure that you must keep active and move around to allow blood flow.  I learned this the hard way after sitting on the couch with a bad migraine.  I had flu like symptoms and after researching I did some minor exercise to work up a tiny sweat and the side effects subsided.",krisriff

8,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 30, 2020",8,"Zomig (zolmitriptan):I have been getting migraines for as long as I can remember. I finally went to the neurologist and have been taking Zomig for 2 years now, it is life changing. It takes about an hour to kick in and it really saves me when I am at work or specially events. I finally feel like a migraine won’t hold me back from doing anything anymore with this medicine. I do have slight side effects like drowsiness, and tingling in my skin when I am taking a shower/bath. Other have mentioned stroke like symptoms but this is very minimal and wears off as soon as the hour has passed and the drug kicks in. The side effects are far less worse than the migraine pain it self so overall I would highly recommend at least trying it out if you suffer from migraine.",Shannon
9,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 28, 2020",1,"Zomig (zolmitriptan):I've been using Zomig for acute migraines for about 3 years.  Luckily I don't suffer from chronic migraines; I only get about 9 a year.  I take 2.5mg dose which takes about 40 mins to kick in.  Eliminates the pain, nausea, and light sensitivity.  I haven't experienced any side effects, however, I did notice that some migraines returned after 24 hours.  I've heard that zolmitriptan use can case rebound headaches which could be what I experienced.  The rebound isn't as bad as the original onset and I try to hold off from a second dose if I can - try to sleep it off instead.  Overall happy with it as a weapon against migraines, enables me to function.",ADF
10,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 12, 2020",6,Zomig (zolmitriptan):So this worked but I need to warn anyone who relies on it do not take it for more that 2 or 3 times in the week! I was taking it nearly everyday for my ongoing migraines and my migraines started to become daily. Then I stopped resorting to zomig and just like that the daily migraine stopped. Medication overuse headaches are real with this drug and are so bad.

My nose was clearer than before like I could breathe and my pain went from severe in my head to mild for only 30 min and the pain came back , this basically did what a Tylenol does (but Tylenol has less side effects and with Tylenol you could take it everyday).

I have to take it early in the headache or it’s not as effective. If I take it during the night I am groggy all day but if I’m already up and doing stuff I don’t get tired and feel better in about a half hour. I do have some sensitivity when I eat something kind of like I am eating something very sour. This medicine has truly changed my life. I have lost jobs and missed so many holidays and family events over the years. I wish I would’ve been prescribed this a long time ago. I use goodrx to get it because insurance stopped paying for it.

Very rarely, maybe once in two to three years, violent vomiting, because I have had a severe head ache for 4 to 6 hours and have taken it way too late on an empty stomach.

Not in 20 mins like others said, may take 2 hrs in the dark but it does work & nothing else does. My problem is that in 2018 I started having trouble getting it. Astra Zeneca used to make a generic that was the same through Impax. Cost me about $400 per month for 30. Impax has discontinued it. Now to get that amount of Zomig it is about $6,800. No formularies carry it. The only thing Zomig can find is the garbage from India which is not the same at all & works zero percent of the time.

Zomig helps soooo much with the pain, the only side effect I have is sleepiness and of course the burning in the back of your throat, but Nothing compared to migraine pain.  It is worth trying, the only thing is since I started taking it I have been getting more migraines and headaches but they was less severe and they end earlier, like I can be out of bed by the late afternoon, which  had  never previously happened.
