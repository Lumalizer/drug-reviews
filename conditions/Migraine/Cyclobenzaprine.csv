2,Cyclobenzaprine,Migraine,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 2, 2021",4,"My neurologist told me to try this after I had a 20 day straight tension/migraine attack that my usual abortive medications (Ulbrevy and Maxlat) didn't touch before I went to the ER (again!). 1x10mg pill and within 1hr I had almost zero pain and nausea! The first time I took it I did get sleepy, but given I hadn't slept well in 2 weeks I wasn't surprised. Since then I've taken it 2x for a severe migraine with neck pain and sledgehammer throbbing in the back of my head (8/10 pain scale) and within 1-2hrs I was back to 2/10. I found if I take it with a cup of coffee or Espresso I have very little sedative effects and can function normally.",JPPA
3,Cyclobenzaprine,Migraine,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 7, 2021",2,"I was on cyclobenzaprine for years for chronic neck pain and never had a migraine while I was on it. Never realized it could be used for migraines. But eventually, it wasn’t working much so I was put on another muscle relaxer.  I recently had an experience that sent me to the ER. Also my mental clarity was taking a big dive. I’d have to say, cyclobenzaprine prevented my migraines.",Lin

5,Cyclobenzaprine,Migraine,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 27, 2019",24,"This cyclobenzaprine is the only thing that helps my headaches, I have  the 10mg tablets and I was told to take a dose of  ½ to 1 pill 3x a day as needed.      If I take it before bed I sleep like the dead and wake up groggy. I stay groggy all day.      It seems to un filter my mouth and I tend to be grouchier than usual. Now that I've been on it for a few weeks that has calmed down, somewhat.      The dry mouth is the WORST of any medication I've had. One pill can dry mr out more than 1 whole day.",NickName
6,Cyclobenzaprine,Migraine,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 16, 2019",19,"I take this drug cyclobenzaprine at night so I can sleep through my severe back pain. Tonight I coincidentally got an intense migraine with aura (flashing lights and vision loss) around the time I normally take my meds, Within 10 minutes of taking the cyclobenzaprine the aura stopped. I have never had it gone that fast and very little headache pain following it.",msunnerstood
7,Cyclobenzaprine,Migraine,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 17, 2019",11,I think the drug might cause my migraines. I lift weights and cycle and swim. I have back issues so take the drug every once in a while. It stands to reason to me that this drug might disturb things and cause that wave of depolarization that shows up as the aura that leads to the pain.  I haven't kept a diary to show more than one instance or association with drug taking and the migraine.,62butYoung2
8,Cyclobenzaprine,Migraine,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 30, 2019",30,"I have dealt with chronic migraines and back pain since my early teens. I've been experiencing some awful muscle/joint pain, tension headaches/migraines, and sciatica for weeks now. I saw my doctor today and she prescribed me Flexiril for the muscle/joint pains. I had a migraine this morning. I took some Excedrin and it made it a little bearable but it was there all day until now... Oh my God the flexiril has worked. I've taken multiple migraine meds, both over the counter and prescription and NOTHING has ever worked this fast. I'm legit amazed at how much better I feel already. She didn't prescribe it for the migraines but I may see if she will. I hate meds usually, but this really works!",Anonymous

10,Cyclobenzaprine,Migraine,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 30, 2018",16,"A few years ago, I found cyclobenzaprine helps with ""weather-triggered migraines""  but you have to know a day ahead of a low pressure system coming in.  I now suffer from two daily sinus migraines 5 am and 5 pm and they clear up instantly with a hot flash.  Very disruptive for sleep.  I have tried lots of prescription medications too. (under the care of a neurologist). One night I could not find my renewed prescription of cyclobenzaprine, so took my prescription amitriptyline (sleep aid) then 1/2 hour later found the cyclobenzaprine,  so I took it.  It was the first night in years that I slept through the night.  So I continued to take both and this resolved 95% of my misery.  and experimented with various doses.  The best for me currently is half dose of amitriptyline & half dose of cyclobenzaprine each night. I sleep through the night now!!!!  and no longer feel sick for half days!!!!  YEAH!!",Anonymous
11,Cyclobenzaprine,Migraine,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 7, 2018",16,"My husband and I both have extensive back problems and he has had a flexerill prescription for years. I used to take them occasionally for my back pain, but I began taking them a year ago to help with my chronic migraines as well. I get cluster headaches on my right side. They are dormant for months, but I then I have episodes of frequent debilitating migraines, anywhere from once a week to twice a day. I took a flexiril one day last summer after nothing else I tried recently had worked. This medicine takes my migraines away in as little as 10 minutes! Sometimes a little longer, but for me it’s usually very fast acting. This medicine is a blessing for me. I recently got my own prescription for my aforementioned back pain. I don’t leave home without it!",clkinzi
12,Cyclobenzaprine,Migraine,10.0,,"March 21, 2018",15,I suffer from severe migraines and I've been on so much meds to try to relieve the migraines and nothing helped till just recently when I was prescribed to cyclobenzaprine . OMG it's amazing. I recommend this to anyone that suffers from terrible headaches like this .,Kee
13,Cyclobenzaprine,Migraine,10.0,,"October 21, 2017",18,"I tried this before I got prescribed it, it worked so well for my tension headaches. For my tension migraines I do take fioricet, and promethazine for the related nausea from other medicines. Today at my pain management appointment I brought up the good experience and the doctor said it would work wonders as long as I take it only occasionally. She said she fully supports Flexeril for migraines and said that she wants me to try it on prescription and see how much they’ll improve. Since it’s not a long term use type of medication I will only use it when the migraines are crippling and debilitating. I’m happy that I don’t need opiates for my migraines and use them for my chronic pain illness only!",Chelseabergstresser
14,Cyclobenzaprine,Migraine,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 10, 2017",23,I get migraines very bad so bad I have to sit in pitch dark room with no sounds and have to try my hardest not to cry. They get so bad I want to literally punch myself to make it go away or focus pain somewhere else. On scale of 1 to 10 they are way above a 10 nothing and I mean nothing was helping. Not Excedrin not Advil not Tylenol. Nothing. These are my miracle medicine. They take my migraines right away. Bout 25 min and gone. I highly highly recommend for ppl who get migraines 3 times a month. As bad as mine. These ARE MAGNIFICENT.,Branchip1112
15,Cyclobenzaprine,Migraine,10.0,,"May 19, 2017",14,"Flexeril relaxes the muscles, which helps relax and calm down and take away a migraine. I take flexeril with fioricet to take mine away. I also have to take a phenergan at first, that's how I know a migraine is starting. These three medications together stops a migraine for me. I just lay down.",Wheezy0330

Mega doses of 5 different anti-seizure medications, beta blockers,  and imitrex self injections and nasal spray.  Years using this stuff got me nowhere.

19,Cyclobenzaprine,Migraine,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2015",17,"Prescribed for two-week Migraine (caused by hormones). It didn't make me drowsy but it definitely did make bed more comfortable. The first time I took half of a 10mg pill, but didn't feel anything so I took a second. I did the same thing the next night and woke up in the middle of the night with parts of my body and my face losing sensation/ going numb. I freaked out until it went away an hour later.Not sure if that's entirely normal or not, Pharmacist was vague. I'm scared to take it again.",NicknameAlreadyInUseMyButt
20,Cyclobenzaprine,Migraine,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 19, 2014",71,"I get a couple of migraines a month.  Not sure if they are aggravated by hormones, stress or sinus pressure, probably a combination.  Regardless I always have throbbing pain on one side of my head along with tight muscles through the neck and shoulder.   Cyclobenzoprine is all that works.  About 30 min after taking it I can feel the tension in my head and eyes lift.  What a life saver after years of pain.  I always back it up with an ibuprofen too.  The ibuprofen alone barely touches it.",hayley b
21,Cyclobenzaprine,Migraine,3.0,,"July 18, 2014",17,"I was prescribed flexeril for migraine pain and relief but it actually seems to cause my headaches to get worse instead of better. Flexeril also makes me so drowsy that I can only take it at bedtime and then I wake up feeling completely hung over. Also, flexeril causes me stomach cramps and diarrhea. It definitely didn't work for my headaches and the side effects were ridiculous so I quit taking it.",disappointed patient

Yes, it knocked me out for about 12hrs but that was a small price to pay in order to get rid of the pain. It just works different for people. My boyfriend takes a 10mg for back spasms and he can barely tell he took one. He is a little under 200 lbs and I'm about 140lbs. I do not take this medication on a regular basis.

I've never had relief from any migraine so I was amazed when after about 2 1/2 hours I got out of bed and felt OK to move around. After another hour or two I was feeling drowsy so ended up going to bed but I was happy to discover that Flexeril helped my migraine. It does make me VERY sleepy so I only take it when I don't have much to do the next day. I usually feel lethargic the day after.,coconnor
