0,Gabapentin,Migraine,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 2, 2022",4,"I have been living with continuous headaches for over 40 years and those would escalate to migraines at least 2 times a month. Other reactive and proactive medications would make me feel sick. Some to the point that I would rather grind through the migraine. I started taking 300mg of gabapentin daily in August, 2021. 2 weeks in I had ocular auras but no migraine. About 3 weeks after starting my doses, I was fully pain free in my head. No headaches and no migraines! It felt like something was missing. I do recommend this to anyone that has migraines. What do you have to lose? This medication is fairly affordable so ask your doctor.",WisMigraine
1,Gabapentin,Migraine,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 15, 2022",7,Okay y’all. I was diagnosed with post Covid lingering headaches that won’t give. I’ve been in constant pain and discomfort since my Covid diagnosis (3+ months ago). I tried a plethora of different migraine meds and NONE worked (likely because I didn’t have a traditional migraine). Gabapentin was recommended by a neurologist on the east coast for lingering Covid headaches so my neurologist said let’s give it a try and IM SO GLAD WE DID! 10/10 recommend if you are looking for lingering Covid headache relief!! I also experience severe anxiety and depression (I’m on celexa as well) and this has helped supplement that tremendously.,Mmmmg

So I tried 600 3x a day. With this dose, headaches started to disappear but other migraine symptoms (difficulty in speaking and understanding others) became worse.So after a week of 600mg 3x daily (overall one month and half) I quit the drug (within 10 days). Overall it didn't help me.Side effects were drowsiness and dizziness, the first 3 days when I started using the drug. But withdrawals were far worse. After quitting it, I started to have a bad depression for about a week, also I was so fatigue for 3 days after quitting.",Arthur M

9,Gabapentin,Migraine,1.0,,"September 25, 2020",16,This drug gabapentin did nothing for my migraines.  It was quick to get in my system and when I tried to get off the drug it made me have more  migraines. I'm now slowly working my way off and dealing with the increased daily headaches. I DO NOT recommend this drug for anyone. I was only taking 300mgs. I'm finally down to 100mgs. A few more weeks and I will be off it.,Bear

I had a lot of energy on the Gabapentin, but was easily agitated. My migraine was not a typical headache, but more of a head sensitivity which made wearing glasses really hard. On the gabapentin medication I started getting regular headaches along with my other pain. I also had stomach bloating and gained 6 pounds in a month.

If I didn't take medicine immediately after the trigger, I suffered from symptoms that resembled a stroke. Also, had on going foggy eyes and vertigo not caused by cataracts nor inner ear.

Took a healthy dose of magnesium & B12 4 hrs after the morning dose to prevent any adverse side effects. My foggy vision and vertigo have disappeared. During the holidays, didn't pack it, the foggy vision appeared with a frontal lobe headache, was able to fix with Tylenol. (My hemiplegic migraines are typical lower back of head and cannot be cured by any ibprofen.)Needless to say, it's working. Went back to take medicine and everything cleared up.

16,Gabapentin,Migraine,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 15, 2019",34,"I have struggled with migraines since the early 90's. Aleve always helped (and still does for headaches) But starting in 2009, my migraines were accompanied by vertigo with violent episodes of vomiting that were completely debilitating. Very little warning, less than 30 minutes, and I had to lay flat, not move, or I would be sick. Barometric changes seem to bring them on, but not always. I went to an ENT doctor who diagnosed them as vestibular migraines since I had ear-ringing and fullness as a prelude to the vertigo. I had several episodes a year for 6 years until in 2015 I was getting them every 2 weeks or so. I was referred to a neurologist who specializes in migraines and she prescribed Gabapentin. I started out on 300mg and now I take 1200 mg every day. I take the pills AT NIGHT because they make me drowsy. I take them 2 hours before bedtime because that is when the drowsiness kicks in. I have not had any of the violent episodes since being on Gabapentin nor any migraines.",WB

About a year later, I saw my doctor for terrible hot flashes and she upped my gabapentin dose to 600 mg and then 900 mg, hoping to relieve my hot flashes. It did nothing for my hot flashes, but I noticed that I wasn't have migraines anymore (I had been having 8-10/month). I started an OTC supplement for hot flashes, which worked wonderfully, and continued the gabapentin for migraine prevention. Like many others, I wish I'd found this years ago!",creeksider

I had been suffering for weeks. Multiple ER trips, and to my primary almost daily for shots of toradol.

I have been taking 3-4 meds a day for prevention but they didn't keep all of my headaches from occurring.  I am soooo happy that I am not dealing with headaches anymore and I know it is due to the Gabapentin.  It makes the side effects(dizziness, a little brain fog)  seem pretty insignificant.

This drug is amazing! I have had migraines my whole life. Something else I noticed is that I get sleepier when the pain/pressure increases or if I get tense .  If I am very sleepy I take a couple of minutes to relax and take a couple of deep breaths. The sleepiness subsides a little. Only a little, but some days that is all I need.",Schwarbek

Nobody has ever been able to help me with them other than the usual suspects like Tylenol, Advil (ibuprofen).  Problem is that due to gastric reasons I'm not supposed to take Advil and that was a problem.  I normally had headaches about 5-6 days a week. I've used Neurontin on and off for neuropathy but I never paid any attention to the effects on my headaches.  One day I was on the phone with my 30yr old son that has the same headaches and he said: Dad, my Neuro put me on Gabapentin for my headaches and it works really well.  Hmm, I said.  I said I will try it again and pay attention.  300mg Neurontin three times a day has given me a 98% reduction.  Damn!  I said I wish I had known this 40yrs ago.  It has been a cure.

Initially I was advised to take 800mg of ibuprofen at the onset, which kind of worked if I took it in this tiny window of time.Before gabapentin I found out on my own that using cannabis was helpful. . .  I don't have any problem with anyone smoking weed but don't like feeling trapped into smoking it constantly myself.  Made me kind of weird socially, also forgetful and lazy.  Also obviously weed wasn't legal anywhere in the U.S. for all of those two decades  Recently Gabapentin has allowed me to stop using daily cannabis to prevent/treat migraines.  I feel a little dopey but not nearly as much as when I constantly smoked weed.  Nothing else ever helped at all including Topamax, which was a nightmare.

My pain management Dr ended up prescribing them for the nerve damage I have as well as a daily basis med to control my headaches/migraines that occurred.

Ignored the build up slowly from 300mg advice and took 3x300mg straight away - spacing them out about an hour at a time over an evening. Effects were significant, but not unpleasant (a bit spacey and very relaxed). Had all the sensations of a headache that night, but without the pain. Since then, taking 300mg around 3 times per day and headaches completely under control. Again, still have sensations of headache, but the pain is down to a 1-2 from 8+.

The 1st dose I took was 300mg during a flare up and I noticed a difference in widespread pain and sensitivity and anxiety. It took an hour to feel any relief. Its not a pain pill. I am SO glad I made sure I had no driving to do that day. Scary but kind of nice for me when a migraine flare comes and you can't sleep. First time in YEARS I didn't get any sort of headache. In disbelief I only took it as needed for bad headache days or flares 300-600mg as needed once a day and its not a coincidence! Despite the side effects the first few times taking it it is the best decision I made! The side effects weren't that bad, first dose was a bit harsh after that it was manageable and went away. 2 pills was way too much so I take 1 at a time. Rarely take any pain meds it works that well.  Highly recommend this to those who skeptics like I was.

If I do get a headache they are manageable where I don't have to take Midrin every other night. I am so glad my doctor put me on this medicine. It was horrible before.,Anonymous

I'm supposed to go up to 1600 mg next week.  These are taken in divided doses. At first I didn't notice anything but today I woke up and I didn't have a headache (I've had daily headaches along with frequent severe migraines for the past 3 straight months).  A mild one came and went a few times today but I feel better.  I'm a bit sleepy and I've been having some trouble remembering things (words, what I've done, etc.) and I've noticed that I've been a little more moody (not by much) but overall I'm happy that my headaches have improved.  They were ruining my life.",Anonymous

A few months ago the doctor needed to up her dosage to 600 mg/day because her weight had changed and she was getting more migraines.
