I also got the migraine cocktail but the doctor never mentioned to me that it could cause the feeling I was about to have.  One of the worst feelings in the world, like your skin is crawling and a terrible anxiety attack with it.  Wanted to rip the IV out and run out of the hospital type feeling . I definitely do not recommend Reglan!! Worst experience at hospital I’ve ever had.",Zach123
2,Metoclopramide,Migraine,,,"January 30, 2022",0,"Reglan (metoclopramide):I had the most horrendous experience with Reglan for migraine. I’ve never had a migraine bad enough to go to the ER, but I couldn’t kick this one. I wish I was well enough to look up each ingredient before I let them administer the drugs to me. The second I received the Reglan dose I immediately felt a crushing, awful, crawling out of my skin weird feeling. I had to pull my mask down and started having a panic attack. Reality felt completely warped. I wanted to pull the IV out, I couldn’t hold still, even though they told me that holding still would make it go away faster: umm, not true. No one told me the potential side effects of this medication. I felt like I was dying, my legs were shaking, I was so restless and hopeless. The nurses kept saying it would go away after a few minutes, of course it didn’t. After 30 mins of this nightmare they finally gave me Ativan for anxiety and it helped. Stay away from Reglan!",No to Reglan
3,Metoclopramide,Migraine,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 25, 2022",0,"Reglan (metoclopramide):Went to urgent care last night after having a migraine for 4 days, they immediately give me a migraine cocktail including Reglan. I will say the cocktail knocked out the migraine very quickly, but almost as quickly I got a horrible feeling of anxiety/doom/like I HAD to get out of there NOW. I wanted to crawl out of my own skin. I probably should have said something to the doctor but I just wanted to leave so badly that I didn't say anything. Exactly like others have described, I was incredible anxious, felt like I needed to get up and run, couldn't hold still. I'm here at home the next day and the side effects still haven't worn off, I'm hoping they will soon because this is miserable. However, I will say the migraine cocktail worked like a charm on the headache itself, and I'm incredibly grateful for that.",icybabe
4,Metoclopramide,Migraine,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 14, 2022",0,"Having suffered a pretty rough migraine in December 2020, I took it upon myself to visit the ER in hopes of finding relief. Once triaged, I was administered an IV dose of Reglan to hopefully ease my pain. Within a minute, I told the tech still in the room that something was terribly wrong and that I needed the doctor immediately. I could feel my chest tightening and breathing becoming labored, but I didn’t understand that it was the most crippling panic attack I had ever experienced in my life. Within another minute, I was writhing in the chair they had me in (pandemic times call for less beds, I get it), and I could do nothing else but sob uncontrollably. The doctor came in quickly and looked distraught, telling me that she hasn’t seen that reaction personally but knew it was a potential side effect.

I am posting this experience from over 4 years ago from my reaction to reglan..that’s how impactful my reaction was to me. I suffer from migraines and I go to the ER whenever it’s really bad. I happened to go to a new hospital one night because I was out of town when a migraine hit me. They gave me some sort of migraine cocktail but with Reglan (which I’ve never had before). As soon as it was pushed through the IV I IMMEDIATELY started coughing uncontrollably, felt a cold rush going down my throat and extreme weight on my chest. I then began to hallucinate while looking around the room I felt like I was going insane. When I looked at the door in front of me all I could see were swirls just everywhere I can’t even explain what I was seeing. My whole body started to shake uncontrollably only letting up for a few seconds before starting again. I then had extreme memory loss when asked simple questions from the techs!!

Sharing this because I started shaking uncontrollably, I almost pulled the needle out of my arm, I couldn't walk when they asked me to get up for my brain scan. When I told the staff I was starting to feel anxious, they said ""yeah you'll feel funny"" which is quite the understatement... I wanted to scream.

My legs felt like they were on fire and I felt as if I was going crazy. I tried to relax and shake it off but the feeling wouldn’t go away and I became dizzy and almost delusional. I called my wife to tell her what was going on and she told me to hit the call button so I called the nurse back in and told her how I was feeling and she said the Reglan has that affect on some people.

My head and thoughts were no longer mine. This was not the worst part. The worst part is that they didn't tell me what medicine I was given nor explained that this was a ""normal"" thing that this med does.

Yep, in just 3 months it will be two years since I have gotten this awful medication. I STILL have issues from what Reglan did to me. It is not uncommon for people to have tardive dyskinesia or akathasia from Reglan. I got akasthasia. For many the symptoms of akathasia go away in an hour or a few days. (Tardive dyskinesia on the other hand, can be permanent. In fact, like I said I got akathasia, not tardive dyskinesia.) Anyway, in many cases the akathasia subsides. But, it can hang on for some. I was one of those unfortunate people. There is a support group on Facebook called the Reglan Support Group for people who have had a harder time recovering from the injury of this drug. I had acute symptoms for 4 months. It was as bad as people describe akathasia on here. The next several months the symptoms were moderate. This drug had destroyed my life.",Miss Fortitude

I think Reglan is a miracle drug. It is nice to know that it exists.The side effects were as bad as people are describing - within about 5 minutes of coming back from the CT I told the aid that I had to leave the building due to being extremely anxious and restless.

26,Metoclopramide,Migraine,7.0,,"May 2, 2020",4,"Reglan (metoclopramide):I have about 15 migraines/months with status migraine at least once per season.  This is actually an improvement from daily incapacitating migraines. There are a lot of empty promises/side effects w/ migraine drugs and often not a lot of relief. Reglan for me was OK for me. I did not get a ton of side effects, but  I found that it does help me break status migraine at home after I found it effective with the Migraine Cocktail in the ER. It's not the immediate ""out of migraine now"" feeling. I find that after I take 3 or 4 doses my migraines taper off out of status within a few (2-3) days. I hate the ER- but I like to incorporate successes in my at home routine after discussing with my neuro. I know that feeling of wanting to rip out the IV. I'd check to see if it was being pushed with a steroid.  If you had a rough time in the ER but it broke your migraine cycle ,I'd talk to your doc about incorporating this in your migraine relief toolbox. It's not perfect but worth a shot.",Sarah H

I had a massive panic attack and couldn't keep my legs still. I started feeling like I needed to get out of my own skin and my clothes were strangling me. I started begging for them to let me leave because I HAD TO go. It took about 30-45 min for me to actually calm down, my headache went away, but I freaked out both my mom and my boyfriend.

Yummy combination, knocked out my migraine and me. Slept for an hour in hospital then another 4 at home. I'm still wiped out but after a doozy of a migraine I am exhausted for at least 5 days post. Almost like a hangover.",Anonymous

171,Metoclopramide,Migraine,10.0,,"April 12, 2013",16,I too received a Reglan (metroclopramide) with Benadryl IV when treated in the ER. I was warned that this medication would make me extremely drowsy and it did. I also have to say I felt an extreme restlessness almost as instantly as I felt the medication reach my veins. I remember my husband holding my hand and rubbing my back and telling me to settle down because I became antsy. I was thrashing a little and tossing and turning in the bed. I think we experience this because the medication comes on so strongly and your first instinct is to try to fight how you're feeling and it gives you extreme fatigue which I believe gives a false sensation or dizziness and that you're falling which I believe is what causes the anxiousness and restlessnes.,Mackie13
172,Metoclopramide,Migraine,10.0,,"February 27, 2012",36,Reglan (metoclopramide):Was given this for a severe migraine along with saline in a drip. After 10-15 minutes I was 100% better and wide awake ready to go and not in an anxious or wired way just felt ready to go home and pick back up my night. Nothing ever has worked this fast for me and I've been to the ER for migraines many times in the past. This was by far the best medicine given to me and I had no side effects whatsoever. 2 thumbs up for this medicine!,Anonymous
173,Metoclopramide,Migraine,6.0,,"October 9, 2010",20,"Reglan (metoclopramide):I was just given Reglan this morning at the ER but don't think they combined it with anything but saline.  Usually I get the physically ""hyper"" feeling but with mind exhaustion with Dramamine or Benedryl.  Those medicines make me feel like all my muscles need to be repeatedly stretched and like they are itchy on the inside.  Luckily I did not get this feeling at all today with just the intravenous Reglan.Even managed to sleep through half the drip.  Only bad thing was that it was really cold going into my arm...my whole arm felt numb.  Also, don't know if it is common or not, but was starving 6 hours later and ate more in 1 sitting than I ever before (I'm sure I will regret that tomorrow).",Anonymous

175,Metoclopramide,Migraine,1.0,,"November 24, 2009",42,"Reglan (metoclopramide):I was given this in an IV (along with Benadryl) in the ER when I had a horrible migraine. The nurse said it would make me tired when she gave it to me at 4 pm. Well I was tired for about 3 min. then the ""fun"" began. Like the other poster, I started to feel extremely anxious. I kept tossing and turning in the bed because I felt like I wanted to crawl out of my skin. I had to wait for 2 IV bags to finish before they would let me leave. When I got home I was exhausted but at the same time could not sit still to save my life. I had that ""wanting to crawl out of my skin"" feeling all night as I paced the house exhausted. I was finally able to fall asleep at 5 am. The next day I was really shaky and still a little bit anxious. ",K_W
176,Metoclopramide,Migraine,3.0,,"August 21, 2009",21,"Reglan (metoclopramide):Like the other anonymous user, I went to the ER with a migraine. I received this medicine and Benadryl (Diphenhydramine) intravenously. The side effects were intolerable. Within minutes of injection a combination of agitation, nervousness and anxiety overwhelmed my already throbbing head. I felt trapped, as if there was no escaping the discomfort of the side effects. I gave this a 3/10 because it still prevented me from throwing up after I already had several times. It works, but I won't ever use it again.I know it wasn't the Benadryl as I have taken it since without incident.",Anonymous
