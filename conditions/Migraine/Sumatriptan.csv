Unfortunately, the generics Sumatriptan vary widely in effectiveness and side effects. I've had some that didn't touch the migraine and made me ill and others that work almost as well as name-brand. If you find a generic that works well, try requesting that particular generic. They are NOT all the same by any means.",manyyears

2,Sumatriptan,Migraine,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 12, 2022",0,"I've taken this as needed for acute migraine attacks.  For me personally, it feels like the weakest of the triptans I've taken but also has the mildest side effects.  Sometimes I don't get any side effects when taking it.  However, I always need the full 100mg dose and I always need it twice (which is the maximum dose in 24 hours).  Even with that, the migraine sometimes recurs.  I always get a brief, less severe rebound migraine the day after taking it but those lingering symptoms usually go away and the migraine ends.  Other times I have to use a stronger triptan...zolmitriptan 5mg and rizatriptan 10mg seem to zap out the migraine pretty much every time for me.  Yeah they have crappy and more pronounced side effects than sumatriptan but I'd rather suffer those and have the migraine completely gone.",Anonymous

Like waking up with a #10 migraine and I don’t want to wait at least an hour for relief. I’m terrified of needles, but the quick relief is worth it. Plus, it’s an auto-injector, you never see the needle- just press the button. I do notice I feel more side effects than with the pill.

My headache is normally gone in 30 minutes.  And I only take 50 MG as I only way about 150 pounds.  I usually take it if I am having a headache late in the day or in the middle of the night. It seems to help me sleep too.  My concern with Sumatriptan is its effect on my blood vessels.  Heart disease is very prominent in my family, so I worry about stroke and heart attack. For that reason I do not take it if I have a headache first thing in the morning or early in the day. If I have a headache in the morning I take one Excedrin for migraine as I do like to work out first thing in the morning. It usually works well, but not as well as the Sumatriptan for me. Unfortunately Excedrin seems to cause rebound headaches. Probably from the caffeine.  My bottom line is Sumatriptan is my go to medication.  I am just careful about any strenuous activity after taking it.",RLD

I took one 25 mg pill, and within 45 minutes, I started feeling the headache dissipate significantly. By an hour, the pain was gone completely even though I was still out.  Anyway, I highly recommend trying this med even at a low dose. Personally I don't experience any side effects - don't feel weird or sleepy. Just feel soo much better! :) For someone who used to just suffer from multiple migraines a month, and almost overdosed on Advil due to the pain (and the Advil not helping sufficiently)...

However, After taking for 15 years, I was getting rebound headaches. I was warned about this by the pharmacist and doctors but dismissed their concerns because nothing else worked. I realized other pain relievers could never touch any headache pain; the only way to take away headache pain was with Imitrex, migraine or not.  I struggled with tingling in my limbs and extreme sensitivity.  I finally had a wake up call when I passed out, ended up in the ER (not related to Imitrex, I don’t think) and finally went to a chiropractor who helped me get the inflammation out of my neck and shoulders through needling.  I have not had a migraine headache or a headache that a pain reliever wouldn’t work on for a year and a half. I am no longer captive to Imitrex and its side effects.

I probably get the body aches once out of every 30 times that I take the Imitrex. So if I have to go to bed once out of every 30 times for a migraine versus every single time, I’ll take it. I suffered debilitating migraines for years with little to no relief. Please stick to YOUR experience and not your opinion when reviewing a drug. Your experience is YOURS and it’s very short sighted to make a general statement that it should be taken off the market or that people shouldn’t take it when it’s been such a positive experience in my life and many other’s.

They are really, really bad. Before Sumatriptan I had to stay in bed all day, snacking on Tylenol like candy (without much effect). Sumatriptan does work. The key is to take it as early as possible. Just when you feel the first tingles of pain - take it. Usually in 30-40 minutes I am pain free. It does come with pretty nasty side effects. For me it's extreme weakness, very heavy feeling arms and legs, low blood pressure and general feel of being unwell. So even after taking it, I have to take it easy - just stay comfortable, watch a movie, read a book, and stay in bed. I usually feel so weak, I can barely walk.

Now that I have been on them for so long they aren’t as effective as they were and the headache usually dulls rather than disappears, I also often have to take two for the same migraine.

I’ll feel pretty weak and unfocused. Today I took it and had a numb, tingling feeling in my left hand. That went away after a few minutes then I started feeling heavy in my tongue. Next, the left side of my mouth and cheek starting going numb. For a minute there, I thought I was having a stroke! Luckily the numbness didn’t last more than 10 minutes but talk about freaky.

It felt like the most painful and unbearable sinus headache I had ever experienced. So, I didn't try to take Imitrex again. Then, at my follow up visit with my doctor, he asked me how the Imitrex was working and I told him that I couldn't take it because it actually gave me a worse headache than I had started with.

I have used sumatriptan since it became available, both in pill form and self-injection. Yesterday I tried the new patch Zecuity for the first time (and likely the last). The actual cost per patch is about $300.00. The packaging is ridiculous: a box overnight delivered which was about two feet square with a weight of about 15 pounds. It contained a large, thick styrofoam container, six special, red PureTemp Bricks, designed to keep the drug at room temperature (it must be kept between 68 it 77 degrees Fahrenheit–NOT refrigerated), and a box of four patches. The patches themselves contain the medication, but also the release/delivery system which includes a computer chip, the red light to indicate activation and completion of medication delivery (four hours–then the light turns off and patch can be removed) and two lithium-manganese dioxide batteries (perchlorate material), which are considered TOXIC WASTE by the federal government and cannot be thrown away in the regular trash. Instructions say to contact your local authorities to inquire how to properly (and legally) dispose of the used patches. The above in and of itself should give most people pause as to whether this is all worth it. But, as anyone who is suffering from a migraine will tell you, the pain and other symptoms are so bad you feel like you’d try practically anything. So, hey, even though this is the same drug, maybe this fancy delivery system is the magic relief we have been searching for. Personally, sumatriptan lessons the duration and severity of my migraines but has never relieved’ them. It may for some, but not for me. Other than the powerful narcotics I take for other chronic pain, it’s the only other thing that helps at all. Of course, there are strict limits on the number of times it can be used per month for safety reasons, so I can only use it for my worst migraines. The limit on the patches: no more than four per month. So, okay, I decide to give them a try. I followed all of the (somewhat detailed and involved) instructions and activate it, apply it, and push the start button and the little red light comes on. Within a few minutes, I start to feel a tingling, itchy, burning sensation, though not too bad and certainly not unbearable, or even anything as bad as the pain of the migraine. Within about five minutes, the gel (I assume the medication), starts to ooze out the sides of the patch, making a sticky mess and of course causing the adhesive of the patch to stop working and the thing starts to practically fall off. Okay, the directions say if there are problems with the patch staying in place to use medical tape. So I use medical tape. All around the entire patch I use medical tape. Five minutes later, even the medical tape starts to come loose due to the ozzing gel, so I apply even more tape, a lot of tape. I am also concerned that there is more medicine sticking to the tape than being absorbed into my body. I also only feel, very slightly, any effect of the sumatriptan. I felt a mild burning sensation the entire time the patch was on, as well as red, irritated, itchy, rashy skin upon removal. Oh yeah, and now what the heck do I do with this environmentally hazardous medical waste? Are most users really going to properly dispose of these things? As far a headache relief, obviously intramuscular injection is a quicker way of getting this drug into your body, to provide whatever amount of relief you are going to get from it as quickly as possible. Another consideration: my health insurance required Prior Approval to cover the patches, part of which was a statement from me and my doctor that the other forms of ingestion of sumatriptan (pill, self-injection, intranasal spray) were inadequate and that I required the patches. When I found that out, I refused and told my doctor to do the same. I had little faith that a 4-hour patch of the same drug would work better than a 5 second injection, and I did not want to give up my ability to keep receiving the injections. The drug company provided the one month free trial (four patches), so I agreed to try them. Several years ago, I remember how happy I was when Imetrix finally went generic and I was able to obtain sumatriptan much cheaper. It saved me (and my insurance company) a lot of money. I don’t really want to give that up either. So, I suppose that there are people who may find these patches amazing and effective, especially those who for whatever reason are unable or unwilling to use the self-injections. For me however, considering all of the factors above, I think I’ll stick with the injectable (pun intended), and sometimes the pills, as I don’t like to carry the auto-injections around in my purse (I already have to carry an epipen with me…). I wish the best to other migraine sufferers; perhaps the patches will give them the relief they seek. For me however, they are not the answer.",Linda H.

Unfortunately the honeymoon wore off after about 8 months.  I used Imitrex quite frequently during that time and had wonderful results, even though sometimes I had to take two pills to really do the job.  But after eight months, 2 pills weren't doing the job, my headache was still lingering.  ",Anonymous

397,Sumatriptan,Migraine,10.0,,"June 6, 2009",3,I have been a sufferer from what was thought to be very bad headache 'attacks' but as I later began to doubt this I was told by my GP that my headaches could actually be migraine attacks. I was given sumatriptan tablets to see if this would help in combating the onset of my headaches and stop them all together and not just preventing a headache from developing into a migraine. I used to suffer from full blown migraines from time to time (once or twice a month) and less severe attacks in between. Now as soon as I begin to feel any kind of eye or neck strain or light sensitivity I know am going to be okay. Ask your GP about Sumatriptan medication. Highly recommended,majika

If I'm nauseous I obviously won't be able to eat a full meal, but the cramps do seem to be decreasing each time I take it anyway. The only other side effects I have are a burning sensation in my nose, and a sore throat, which are both tolerable. Imitrex is very expensive, but definitely worth it to me.
