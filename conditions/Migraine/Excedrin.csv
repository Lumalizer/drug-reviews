0,Excedrin,Migraine,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 27, 2022",0,"I'm off painkillers because of this. Works incredibly well for my condition, every single time I need it. Excedrin has been a lifesaver. It only takes 1 pill of extra strength. And headaches are soon gone! Also helps with my sinus pressure for some reason. The caffeine may keep you awake if you're sensitive to, so 9/10! Great medicine.",parapara
1,Excedrin,Migraine,1,,"October 15, 2021",0,"Do NOT take if you are even the slightest sensitive to caffeine or have anxiety. I took 2 pills and almost immediately after I experienced the worst brain fog, dizziness, and hand numbness. I had a friend rush me to urgent care because it felt like a near death experience. It was the scariest thing that had ever happened to me",julia
2,Excedrin,Migraine,10,,"December 27, 2020",0,"I rather take Excedrin before a prescription medicine from my doctor. Don’t take on an empty stomach.If you can’t take anything with caffeine in it don’t take it. If you have headaches that you can’t live or function with then there is a problem go to your doctor. Excedrin is only for temporary pain reliever and if the pain comes back again then you got a problem go to your Dr.A lot of times when you get those kind of migraine headaches. It could be your diet the foods that you’re eating your living situation could bring on allergies like smells, dirt, dust dog ,cat hair even air we breathe it’s all. Maybe get some exercise get your blood moving always helped.",SLK
3,Excedrin,Migraine,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 20, 2020",0,"I have severe migraines at least twice a week and a constant headache the rest of the time, likely having something to do with previous concussions and head injuries. No amount of OTC drugs or combinations have seemed to help and neither have any other at home headache/migraine treatments. Excedrin migraine does relive some of the headache pain but intensifies a lot of my other symptoms to the point where it is not worth it. Within an hour of taking it I end up disoriented and quite dizzy, the dizziness being normal for my migraines but once again intensified when I take excedrin.",Anonymous
4,Excedrin,Migraine,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 19, 2020",1,"I've taken Excedrin for headaches and body aches since 1972, when I was in the US Army.  Works very well most of the time.  The only time I had a problem, was many years ago, I got a bottle that must have turned bad or expired.  Had a vinegar smell, and caused dizziness within a short time of taking it.Advice, if the medicine has a sour smell, the aspirin content may have been altered, by age, or moisture, etc.  Do not use.",Huey
5,Excedrin,Migraine,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 16, 2020",6,"I’ve had a migraine for about 4 days now. It was helping in the beginning, but I took it and now my heart rate is sky rocketing. I feel dizzy and can’t fall asleep. I’m hoping this goes away soon, it is a very odd sensation. It kept me up all night. I just want to sleep! :(",Migraines :(

7,Excedrin,Migraine,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 7, 2019",4,"I got this medication from my doctor to treat weekly migraines. However, I found that this medication has only made my migraines more frequent! If I take it one day, it’ll return the next day. I never used to wake up with headaches, but now every morning is tainted with migraine. If I can catch my headache in time, it gets rid of the headache but introduces shakiness, dizziness, and stomach pain. If I wait too long to take the medication (i.e. wake up with a full-blown migraine) then it still causes these side effects, but combined with the headache, nausea, and dizziness of migraine, I feel 10x worse. Without my headache, side effects are bearable. With it, though, I really just want to blink out of existence. Take with caution or avoid all together. My migraine days have increased 7-fold since taking this medication.",zoë
8,Excedrin,Migraine,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 6, 2019",4,I want to express how much I appreciate this medication! I get migraines every now and again that even prescription medications didn’t help. But excedrin seems to help almost 100 percent of the time and I amSo grateful because I am able to actually function and get through the day without having to suffer!!! Thank you so much!!!,Coco
9,Excedrin,Migraine,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 7, 2019",3,"I have spent more than 14 years with migraines that have taken me to the hospital numbing my whole body, vomiting and intense pain, until I tried Excedrin and I have been taking it for 6 months when I want to get a migraine and I am gone in 20 minutes I love it finally I can lead an almost normal life.",Lupe
10,Excedrin,Migraine,8,,"February 27, 2019",1,"32 yrs of migraines; Excedrin Migraine is helpful at the first sign (I am able to work as a night nurse). I do not drink/eat anything w/ caffeine so causes some jitteriness, but doesn't cause drowsiness (eating helps). I have food trigger/hormone trigger migraines, working with my Dr has taken time as my migraines have increased in intensity/duration. I take Excedrin Migraine day 1; after 24 hrs I need Sumitriptan (can w/ naproxen; Sumitriptan should not be taken with other pain med). Day 3, I use fioricet. When my symptoms wane, I use Excedrin Migraine. I talk with my pharmacist to avoid any med interactions (also advised a safe less drowsy motion sickness med for imbalance. There is not anything available for vision blurriness, but Excedrin Migraine does not intensify that symptom. I had my blood work/MRI done to rule out any underlying symptoms. My Dr advised Excedrin Migraine and it is very helpful.",OKNurse
11,Excedrin,Migraine,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 5, 2019",1,When I get headaches it is so bad I have taken every headache medicine I know of but none of them worked for me till I try  Excedrin.  I hadn't tried it  till last month. I tried it and my headache was gone in about 15 mins  so ever since then I brought me a bottle of Excedrin and now I barely even get headache. I even wake up now in the morning feeling better then ever so now when one of my friends comes to me and say they have a bad headache I give them a Excedrin and I tell them to buy Excedrin my days have been so much better n I barely have headaches now thanks so much for the product,Victoria
12,Excedrin,Migraine,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 25, 2018",16,"I had the worst experience taking Excedrin for the first time. I ended up in the hospital shortly after due to having a bad reaction to the caffeine in this medicine. My heart began racing and jumped to 130 bpm and kept rising. I began feeling faint and was rushed to the hospital. Although my migraine went away, it was not a pleasant experience. Be aware if you are sensitive to caffeine.",Kay
13,Excedrin,Migraine,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 9, 2018",2,I love excedrin migraine. I get migraines on and off but when I get them they last for a week. Excedrin gets rid of my pain in 20 minutes and I can go about my day.  You could get stomach ulcers is from taking too much of it or taking it every day. It’s meant to be used every once in a while. Also had a fever and it got rid of it and my body aches in 20 minutes.,Ace
14,Excedrin,Migraine,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 14, 2017",8,"I had a horrible experience with Excedrin Migraine. Shortly after taking it, my heart started racing super fast, I got extremely anxious, and my body started shaking. Like other people are saying, if you are sensitive to caffeine do not take this medicine. It didn't take my migraine away either so it's not worth it at all.",RS18
15,Excedrin,Migraine,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 4, 2017",2,"Great migraine/headache relief.  I never had a headache before I turned 30, but I have had tons of morning allergy related headaches/migraines.  Nothing helped until I tried excedrin migraine forumula or extra strength (both have the same ingredients).  Often get relief from one pill.  It has a mix of caffeine, aspirin, and tylenol that works great.",NCResident
16,Excedrin,Migraine,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 18, 2016",6,"I don't normally get headaches in general but when I do, they're horrible. I took an Excedrin after I developed I really bad headache upon getting off work for the day. My headache was gone in about 30 minutes tops. However, the side effects of this pill outweighed how fast it fixed my headache. I took the pill in the car on the way home and by the time I reached my home in 15 minutes I began feeling woozy. I started to feel light headed and felt this weird feeling in my stomach. I assumed it was because I was hungry but after forcing myself to eat food it only made things worse. I felt so bad that I just laid down early for the night so that when I woke up the feeling would most likely be gone. Nope! I woke up & vomitted shortly.",keilal
17,Excedrin,Migraine,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 24, 2016",2,"Ive struggled with headaches for as long as I can remember and nothing worked for me. When I found excedrin, I was hooked to the fact that it was the best. I've never use anything else since. I have introduced everyone I know to it and they always come to me, because they know I always got a bottle of excedrin with me. I just wanted to say Thank You. Your product has made headaches to me just a pain that soon go away when I take my excedrin.",Mille26

21,Excedrin,Migraine,1,,"March 25, 2016",6,"I woke up with a Migraine and took this, it dulled it, but never went fully away.  When I was able to take my next dose I did.  Soon after my vision started to blur, my face was flushed, I felt light headed, dizzy, the room was spinning, my heart was racing (over 180bpm! Well over that), & I felt like I was about to pass out.  Turns out it was a reaction to the CAFFEINE in this.I am not a caffeine free person and had never had this experience before, but the doc said the caffeine is a high dose in this.I now take Aleve or Maxsalt for bad migraines, no issues.",Carminemelody

It makes me wonder why I haven't heard about this drug until I saw the commercial on TV lol/Don't drink coffee with this though, it made me very shaky--to the point where my latte was visibly shaking in my grasp :(",lillynong
23,Excedrin,Migraine,9,,"March 29, 2010",16,I have used Excedrin for approximately 15 years and it does the trick in probably about 95% of my headaches. There are a few that it does not stop but the trick really is taking it at the first sign of a headache and not waiting. Usual relief comes in approximately 15 to 20 minutes.,angiem65
24,Excedrin,Migraine,10,,"November 4, 2009",18,I've used regular and migrane vesions of Excedrin and they have both work effectively.  The pain relief is realized within 15 minutes of taking.  I swear by this product and have used countless others when I did not have Excedrin at my disposal.  I highly recommend this product.,Anonymous
