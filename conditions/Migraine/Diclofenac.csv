0,Diclofenac,Migraine,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 5, 2021",0,"I originally got this medicine for a different condition, but decided to try it for my migraine when my regular migraine medicine (sumatriptan) did not help any and I was desperate for relief. The medicine relieves my migraine pain effectively. It does not take the pain away completely, but I would say it does take 80-90% of the pain away, so very effective indeed, considering that my pains are very bad (usually 8 on the traditional 1-10 pain scale) and no other pain medicines give any relief at all. I asked my doctor to change my existing migraine prescription of sumatriptan to diclofenac instead, and I take 1x50 mg when a migraine strikes. The full effect comes after 1-1½ h. The medicine is available in different formats - both regular oral pills as well as suppositories in case one tends to be nauseous during the migraines and has difficulty keeping pills inside long enough to allow them to help. I highly recommend this medicine for migraines.",JessicaO

The only time I was able to stomach it was when I was so stuffed up I had absolutely no taste and had run out of all my other options.

I started to do stuff around the house, No side effects until about an hour  later I weirdly started to feel chest pressure from being anxious for no reason at all. I have anxiety from time to time. So idk if this just kick started it a bit or what. I loved that it got rid of it now let’s see how long it last! So far still headache free it’s currently 12 BUT I am a little anxious and my chest is a little uncomfortable.

20,Diclofenac,Migraine,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 21, 2018",11,"Cambia (diclofenac):Cambia works perfectly for me. I get zero side effects from it, so I take it at the first sign of aura or pain because there's no side effect trade off. BUT even when I haven't been able to take it at onset, it still works for me. If taken hours in, it sometimes doesn't remove all pain , but I take another and that one always takes the rest of the pain away. But since I don't get dizzy or drowsy, I keep it with me at all times and take it wherever I am. It's given me my life back. Sometimes my sensitivity to light & sound stays a bit. This isn't a side effect of the med, I think it's just that I still have a migraine in the background, with no pain. Maybe it's just post migraine fog though, as it doesn't present right away. It's hours after. Tip: works best on empty stomach. Wait to take it for 15-30 minutes if stomach is full. Don't drink or eat anything for another 30 minutes while it's absorbing into your stomach lining.",Andie

22,Diclofenac,Migraine,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 18, 2018",7,"Cambia (diclofenac):After trying many other migraine medications, like most, I found this to be the best with the least amount of side effects.  It only takes between 20 minutes to 1 hour to start working.  For me, the side effects are minimal.  I don't get drowsy or feel weird, but certainly shouldn't operate any machinery or do any heavy thinking.  Honestly, I feel pretty good, like I could do stuff, but found I have a slight disconnect to the brain.  So it is safer to just kick your feet up while on this medication & rest for a few hours.  The only down side for me is that to completely get rid of migraine & no reoccurrence, I need to take a second dosage.  But to me it is worth it & really helps me rid those awful migraines.

My neurologist thought that I should try Cambia, saying that it was faster-acting (and better for me in the long term - not sure if I buy that, after looking at the side effects) than triptans. It lessened the intensity of my migraine for about two hours, after which my migraine was worse than ever. I ended up having to take a double dose of triptan. The package that I have (sample) does contain aspartame, which I know I don't react well to, so perhaps that was part of the problem. Anyway, I won't be trying it again.

57,Diclofenac,Migraine,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 8, 2012",45,"Cambia (diclofenac):Finally took the sample given to me by my doctor after nothing else was making a dent in my migraine after approximately 12 hours. This worked literally within an hour. Felt wonderful and not at all ""fuzzy"" headed. Will always be keeping a dose of this on hand with me.",Anonymous
58,Diclofenac,Migraine,10.0,,"May 30, 2012",49,Cambia (diclofenac):It works completely within 30 to 60 minutes.  However my migraines do come back the next day.  Am a little concerned about taking Cambia everyday.  Have been getting migraines daily for the last 8 days.  The meds you take daily to stop migraines make me feel like I'm wrapped in cotton and out of touch with the world. ,Anonymous
59,Diclofenac,Migraine,10.0,,"November 27, 2011",58,"Cambia (diclofenac):I have suffered from prolonged migraines for over 20 years.  This is the first medicine I have used that relieved my pain.  My recent migraine was going on twelve hours when it was suggested that I try this medication.  Within 1 1/2 hours it was gone.  I am hoping not to use it again for a while, however the next time I need Cambia and it works, I will have found my miracle.",Anonymous
60,Diclofenac,Migraine,10.0,,"November 7, 2011",65,Cambia (diclofenac):I love Cambia. I took 4 doses of Imitrex in a 24 hour period and couldn't get rid of a migraine. Out of desperation I took a sample dose of Cambia my doctor gave me and my migraine was gone in 15 minutes. I called my doctor and had him call in a prescription for me.  It was the fastest acting pain reliever ever.,Anonymous
