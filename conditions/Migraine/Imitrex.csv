0,Imitrex,Migraine,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 8, 2022",0,"I’ve had migraines since my 20’s- I’m 63 now! Imitrex has been a lifesaver for me. I take 100mg at the onset of migraine. Don’t wait until it’s full blown! I also use Imitrex injection in emergencies. Like waking up with a #10 migraine and I don’t want to wait at least an hour for relief. I’m terrified of needles, but the quick relief is worth it. Plus, it’s an auto-injector, you never see the needle- just press the button. I do notice I feel more side effects than with the pill. Rebound headaches are very possible if you take it too often.I would have missed out on so much life without it.",Lisa Bartelli

2,Imitrex,Migraine,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 15, 2021",0,"Like several was confused for a while thinking migraines were sinus or ear infections, first sign is ear pain for me.  Have gotten worse as I hit 50 and entering perimenopause.  Really struggled with 48 hour long pain vomiting till OB prescribed Imitrex.  Like others if I wait too long it’s benefit isn’t as great as when I take it at the first sign.  I don’t know about the rebound headaches as my migraines are so bad my headaches for days later and am foggy for a few days.  Imitrex maybe makes me a little spacey, but far more functional than with a migraine!!  And the side effects are shorter than when I have a migraine.",Perimenopause
3,Imitrex,Migraine,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 23, 2021",0,"It truly works for me and I'm grateful for it! Sometimes I need the second dose, it really depends on how soon I take the med when I feel a migraine coming on. The only side effects I've ever noticed is I may get a sore neck or an upset stomach (if taken on an empty stomach) but that's nothing compared to a migraine! I usually just take some pepto and drink Gatorade and that helps.",Jessycarose
4,Imitrex,Migraine,5.0,,"June 11, 2021",10,"I took Imitrex, for many years to knock out migraine headaches.  However, After taking for 15 years, I was getting rebound headaches. I was warned about this by the pharmacist and doctors but dismissed their concerns because nothing else worked. I realized other pain relievers could never touch any headache pain; the only way to take away headache pain was with Imitrex, migraine or not.  I struggled with tingling in my limbs and extreme sensitivity.  I finally had a wake up call when I passed out, ended up in the ER (not related to Imitrex, I don’t think) and finally went to a chiropractor who helped me get the inflammation out of my neck and shoulders through needling.  I have not had a migraine headache or a headache that a pain reliever wouldn’t work on for a year and a half. I am no longer captive to Imitrex and its side effects. I believe once on Imitrex long term, rebound headaches will occur. I am so glad I am free from the bondage.",Headachefree
5,Imitrex,Migraine,10.0,,"May 31, 2021",25,"I’ve gone to the emergency room with migraines many times because I was so ill.When I tried Imitrex, it was a lifesaver. I’ve only had a couple of migraines that didn’t respond to it. The only occasional side effects I’ve had with it are severe body aches. Still better than a migraine and vomiting. I probably get the body aches once out of every 30 times that I take the Imitrex. So if I have to go to bed once out of every 30 times for a migraine versus every single time, I’ll take it. I suffered debilitating migraines for years with little to no relief. Please stick to YOUR experience and not your opinion when reviewing a drug. Your experience is YOURS and it’s very short sighted to make a general statement that it should be taken off the market or that people shouldn’t take it when it’s been such a positive experience in my life and many other’s. I missed out on a lot of things with my daughters because of migraines before imitrex. It works wonders for millions.",Theresamarie21

I had a coworker who suffered with migraines and she introduced these to me when I had a horrible headache. She took the 100 mg, and when she gave me one to take, it knocked me out into the next week. I usually have horrible period migraines and ones that I'll get on occasion. This is the only thing that works for me except I take the 50 mg. There has been a couple of times they didn't work . .but that is minimal to the times it did work.

8,Imitrex,Migraine,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2021",2,I took this for the first time nearly 20 years ago and it caused so much pain I passed out and didn't wake up for 18 hours. Last year my doctor prescribed it to me again thinking I may have grown out of it. So a couple of days later I was having a bad migraine and I took it. After just a few minutes my skull started feeling like it was on fire. The pain was so intense I immediately started pacing not knowing what to do. I ended up laying down while my wife brought me ice packs and I eventually passed out just as I did 20 years ago.,landbyrd1

At my worst I was having at least one migraine a week.  My experience is that within 30 minutes to an hour I am relieved IF I eat after taking.  My get sleepy most times and my neck gets very heavy.

12,Imitrex,Migraine,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 15, 2020",83,"I found Imitrex works well if I take it the second I feel any of the migraine symptoms. If I wait even 20 minutes past that it'll usually make the headache worse. I suffer migraines with auras and cluster headaches. Like most everyone there is no way to function once a headache starts. Mine starts when the barometric pressure raises or lowers with cold fronts, hurricanes any weather condition that changes the barometric pressure. The pain is rough but the confusion and not able to function for sometimes days on end is the worst. Only advice I could give anyone with this drug is if you know your body well enough to know a migraine or cluster headache is starting take it immediately, don't wait! That is the only way it works for me. When it does work it is amazing! A wonderful tool to the Arsenal to fight these crippling headaches.

I was getting a migraine that began as nausea, hot flashes, dizziness and weakness the entire day. That night the pain started so I took 25 mg imitrex in 90 min the pain was gone. I felt some pressure where the pain had been and couldn’t lay on that side. A week later I feel another migraine come on and I wasn’t sure it was a migraine until the nausea came. Took imitrex again and the pain went away after 2 hours but then I got super drowsy and fell asleep and woke up an hour later shaky and anxious. I had not had a good nights sleep the day before so those symptoms may be attributed to lack of sleep but they went away after a few hours. I did try imitrex in the middle of a migraine with nausea, blurry vision, severe pain and it didn’t  help. I was discouraged and did not take a second dose that time. I suggest taking imitrex as soon as you feel pain",Jenn

Then an hour passed and I’m full blown in pain all over my body, I’m talking aching so bad it felt like I had the worst flu in history ... but my migraine was gone .

I thought I would have to suffer with 3 to 4 day long headaches that feel like a knife in my temple the rest of my life. But imitrex knocks it out in 30-40 min. There are side effects: muscle aches, tiredness, sensitive skin and the need to pee constantly. Annoying but of you've had migraines for years it is a good trade off.

22,Imitrex,Migraine,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 28, 2019",24,"I wanted to share a positive experience here. I've been a migraine sufferer since 17 and I am now 24. I am one of the lucky ones who found imitrex to work first try back then, and continues to take it to this day. This drug is a miracle for me. I admit that I have had to bump my doses from 50mg to 100mg, but it still works the same. I am also lucky that I only need it once a month around the  start of my period, however when I was younger I used to need them 5 times a month or so. Anyway, I just take one and in about 45-60 minutes the pain and nausea start to get better. It usually takes 90 minutes for them to be fully gone. I do sometimes get a feeling similar to whiplash (stiff neck and shoulders) and sore scalp but the side effects are far better than a migraine. My migraines stay away and I never have to take another pill, until the next month. I'm very thankful for this medicine.",nathalieo

I have been suffering for over 25 years with migraines and then Imitrex came on the scene that was the end of the migraines. The symptoms always began behind my right eyeball and I was able to tell that's a headache was coming and that's when I took the Imitrex immediately when I started feeling symptoms not waiting until my headache is full-blown, which seems sensible to me.  It is better to knock it on the head when it isn't to back so you don't have to endure it to long.",Anonymous
24,Imitrex,Migraine,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 8, 2019",7,"I had a horrible reaction to Imitrex, due to a possible drug interaction with Wellbutrin. I had gone to the E.R., worried that I might have been having a stroke. It was clearly stated in my chart that I was on Wellbutrin, but they prescribed Imitrex for me at the E.R. anyway, after presenting with what they concluded to be a complex migraine. I took an Imitrex pill when I got home, and almost immediately after taking it, I experienced the most horrendous and oppressive, burning headache.  It felt like the most painful and unbearable sinus headache I had ever experienced. So, I didn't try to take Imitrex again. Then, at my follow up visit with my doctor, he asked me how the Imitrex was working and I told him that I couldn't take it because it actually gave me a worse headache than I had started with. He said, ""oh yeah, Imitrex is known to have a negative interaction with some antidepressants, like Wellbutrin. I wish someone had noticed that when they prescribed it to me.",Kat

I recently started taking Imitrex.   It's amazing.  It does take a while to kick in, probably about an hour to 2.  The pain goes away within about 20 minutes but I still have a pressure like feeling until about an hour or two later.  It also has really helped my depression, maybe because of the serotonin element in the medication.  It doesn't make me tired or dizzy luckily.  I do feel relaxed, but not in a bad way.  I really love it.",mermom

It relieves the physical pain and I am able to see, walk, and talk,  but I am still pretty much down for the count. It says you can take it every 2 hours, but MAN, 1 dose and I feel it for the rest of the day. I get very drowsy, my eyes get droopy, and it feels like I’m walking underwater...or through thick honey. Everything feels so heavy. My speech is slower. I get waves of nausea. Once I take it, I’m home for the day— no way would I feel comfortable driving.

I always try to hold off on taking Imitrex for as long as I can before I cave, which is probably not the best course of action. It does work after approx 1-2 hrs, but until the effect does work I get weird, uncomfortable side effects. My throat gets tight and it's difficult to swallow, any other muscle ache I have gets amplified, my arms/legs feel incredibly heavy and overall I just feel like I am floating in my own skin, if that even makes sense.

It makes my skin feel prickly and tight, and my throat feels tight and like I can't swallow. It gives me such intense nausea that I often don't speak when I take it because I feel like if I open my mouth, I'll throw up. From trial and error, the nausea seems to abate if I take it with food, but if I forget to take it with food I have to force myself to eat through the nausea. My brain also feels really foggy and basic actions are difficult when I take it.I'm glad there are people who don't react like this, but I am definitely asking to be switched to a different medication.",ElectricHarpsichord

I’m talking, tingling fingers, trying to talk but my brain can’t find my words, PAIN that lasts at least 2 days with 1-2 of my brain not working. I tried Fioricet and it didn’t work. Magnesium aspartate supplements helped a ton with the tension and blindness headaches.  Finally my dr gave me this and OH MY GOSH 30 mins later I felt so much better, by an hour it was gone!! I still feel like my brain is dulled for several hours but even though I can no longer feel the headache, it’s still there messing stuff up. On occasion I have to take two. If I let the pain get really bad before I take it, it takes longer to work. I can usually count on it being gone for 6-20 hours before I need to take again. I love it.
