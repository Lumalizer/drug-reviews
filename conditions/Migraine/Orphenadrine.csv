1,Orphenadrine,Migraine,5,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 8, 2018",6,"I use one 50mg tablet of this muscle relaxant along with one or two Naproxen Sodium (Alieve) tablets as a first line regiment to break an initial starting migraine.  For some early/mild migraines this can give relief.  When not caught early (within 1 hr) or it is a moderate migraine second line regiment includes a 2nd Orphenadrine dose and a 50mg Tramadol (Ultram) which usually provides relief in addition to lying down, relaxing in a dark quiet cool room.  Strong migraines use third line regiment of a 2nd Tramadol, coffee (caffeine), warm shower/bath, foot/hand massage, soothing music, as well as, dark quiet cool room.",SWhite
2,Orphenadrine,Migraine,1,,"April 14, 2018",12,"I was prescribed this for my migraines and slight muscle spasms. The first day after taking it, I was having frequent urination, dry mouth, dizziness, nausea, hot flashes, and confusion. I continued taking it for 7 days, but the side effects became worse. Nausea turned to vomiting. Eyes became so blurry I couldn't read anymore. My arms and face started getting tremors and I was having pressure in my face. I started getting extreme episodes of  anxiety. I discontinued the medication and everything has slowly gotten better. It's been about 11 days and I still am dealing with the nausea, but everything else has almost gone away. Just nausea and tremors still remain.",Joe
3,Orphenadrine,Migraine,10,,"January 24, 2018",20,Norflex (orphenadrine):Only drug that has broken a bad 1 week cycle of migraines.  One IM injection and my head starts to feel better within the hour.,Ecarg
4,Orphenadrine,Migraine,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 20, 2017",11,"Have been using orphenadrine  for migraine for several years. I use 100mg ER tablet with 1000mg acetaminophen. It is the only thing that has consistently worked on my migraines without major side effects. It is inexpensive and nonaddictive but not used much in the US. I had suffered for years with migraines, had been on atenolol with some decrease in the number but it exacerbated asthma. I discovered this medication while living in the Philippines and it has been a lifesaver. Fortunately I have migraines only 2 to 3 times per month. I do not know how it would work with intractable migraines.",nurse56

6,Orphenadrine,Migraine,10,,"July 28, 2014",22,"I suffered for years, this is the only medicine that got rid of my migraines. Everything else just calmed the migraines down but they did not go away. I also found it worked for seasickness, I would get violently sick even on mild water. Now I can enjoy the ocean. I now will be the only one not sick on rough days. I take it with an aspirin and caffeine pill. If you find it doesn't work you might have to up the dose.",karenvabeach
7,Orphenadrine,Migraine,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 6, 2013",28,I ended up in ICU with heart palpitations (over 200 bpm). I only took one tablet of Norflex and this happened almost 6 hours after taking it. Turns out I'm allergic to orphenadrine.,Dewald
8,Orphenadrine,Migraine,3,,"April 19, 2010",47,"Norflex (orphenadrine):Made me blurry, drowsy and cognitive dulling. Short trial only (two weeks) then stopped due to side effects.",vaughan121
9,Orphenadrine,Migraine,10,,"November 23, 2009",23,I was first given this medicine for intractable migraines at the Diamond Headache Clinic in Chicago.  The headaches were so severe that I could not even lay my head on a pillow.  After treatment with Orphenadrine Citrate 60mg IM every 6 hours.  No more migraines.  I maybe have to take it once a month.  When they occur.....it takes care of them.  This is adjunct emergency medicine I might add.  They placed me on Verapamil 180 SA once a day and Keppra at night.  So far so good. Headache free for the first time in over 15 months.  My doctor there was great.,Depaul44
