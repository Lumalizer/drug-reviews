0,Memantine,Migraine,8,,"December 18, 2021",2,"I have been suffering from migraine for the last 40 years. My neurologist just put me on Memantine two weeks ago.  I feel nauseated in the morning and some mild headaches for few days when I change the dosage, but after that I get better till I start the new dosage again.  I started with 5mg for one week and 10mg for the second, now I started with 15mg.  The migraine is way better, still the headache is there, but I didn't take any Maxalt since I started the Memantine.  I use to have 15-20 days of migraine every month. I can handle the headaches now. I will update this after few months.",Hanan S.
1,Memantine,Migraine,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 24, 2020",14,"I tried memantine for my migraines. It made me really dizzy, which I had already been struggling with after a concussion, and it made me feel drunk. My brain felt slow, my whole body felt heavy, and walking was really hard because of the dizziness. My period is also now 9 days late and I know I'm not pregnant and I have never missed a period in my life. I'm really glad this medication works so well for so many people, but the side effects were too much for me to handle.",Tessa
2,Memantine,Migraine,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 25, 2018",26,Very happy with this drug!  I have tried a long list of supposed migraine prophylactic drugs over the last 15 years but none have worked for me. Memantine is a game changer for me.  I started at 5 mg and titrated up to 10 mg after a week. I very quickly began to see an effect with the 10 mg.   The frequency of headaches was greatly reduced and even the ones I did have were much milder sometimes to the point that I didn't have to use my usual triptan.  I am now at 15 mg for the last few weeks to see if I can get any further improvement. I have gone from having ~12 headaches a month to around 4 mild ones very quickly.  I have no side effects that are apparent to me- a little burning in my legs for a few days when I increase the dose.,gp
3,Memantine,Migraine,10,,"April 12, 2016",34,"I have been taking Namenda for almost a year for migraines and it has worked beautifully. When my pharmacy ran out, I said OK for the generic memantine made by Sunpharma. Big mistake. My headaches returned. Coincidence? I think not. I was able to get the insurance to approve a refill with brand-name Namenda and will resume that tomorrow.",Ron N
4,Memantine,Migraine,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 7, 2013",53,"I began taking this medication on the recommendation of my neurologist for chronic migraines. I am currently taking Topamax and Elavil and I am attempting to get off the Topamax because the neuro felt it isn't helping any longer (I agree with her). I totally love the Namenda for my migraines!! All I can say is if you are wanting to try something different, please do try this. I have virtually no side effects...maybe the dizziness if I had to pick one, but overall, it is working better than I could have ever hoped!",busymommy00
