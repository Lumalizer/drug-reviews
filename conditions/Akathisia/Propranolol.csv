0,Propranolol,Akathisia,6,,"August 4, 2021",1,"I was prescribed 10mg of this to combat akathisia from Vraylar. Maybe the dose was too low, but I didn't feel much of an effect. It did help and lower my heartbeat, but Akineton (an anticholinergic) worked much better for me, since it also helped with the tremors. Propranolol doesn't affect that side of things, but for most people, akathisia is the most painful part of an extrapyramidal reaction so you might want to give it a try. I've got asthma that needs constant maintenance, but propranolol didn't affect it at all.",Anonymous
1,Propranolol,Akathisia,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2021",4,Started propranolol IR 10 mg twice daily yesterday for bad akasthesia that is caused from gabapentin PAWS.   It has decreased it to the point of tolerability.  I barely notice it.  May end up needing to increase the dose eventually but so far so good.,Becca
