0,Ketoconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 20, 2022",0,This drug was one of the only oral anti fungals I wasn’t allergic to and worked amazingly well to clear all yeast infection within the ten day treatment on the lowest dose.  Very disappointed that it was removed from use in Australia because some people on long term use of it got serious side effects.  You’d think they’d just restrict all long term use rather than remove a very good treatment tablet.  Now I have nothing to take or apply that I’m not allergic to or have extreme side effects with.,Australia

5,Ketoconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,3.0,,"June 26, 2011",17,I have Lyme Disease so I got a yeast Infection from antibiotic usage. My yeast infection is nothing like you will find. Basically just feels like rug burn on the head of my penis. Unfortunately it rubs in my underwear when I walk around so its VERY ANNOYING. I was given Diflucan and it gave me head pressure so they gave Ketoconazole and its my second/third day on it. I have NOT seen any substantial improvements. Yes its helped but this should work faster.,Anonymous
