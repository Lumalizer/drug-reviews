0,Nystatin topical,Vaginal Yeast Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 2, 2021",0,Was prescribed this cream for external use for 10 days despite the extreme itch and irritation coming from inside. This cream made me itch 10x more. On the 4th day (today) of use I was so itchy it felt like I had poison ivy down there. Some got in the entrance and it was immediate FIRE. I had to use a wet rag to clean up as much of it as I could. I’m not using that anymore & just started using monistat 7. But I will say a lot of the clumpy discharge I had has disappeared but I still have occasional itching so not complete gone.,Neveragain1202
1,Nystatin topical,Vaginal Yeast Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 20, 2020",13,This  nystatin is the worst medicine ever for a vag yeast infection. If you are prescribed this please ask for something different. My yeast infection is gone but this cream burns like fire. How long is it supposed to keep burning ?,Pinky
2,Nystatin topical,Vaginal Yeast Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 28, 2020",31,"Glad I found these comments!  I thought I was a freak.  This is my second go-around with NYSTATIN cream USP and the Powder.  I took a second dose of Fluconazole (tablet) per doctor's advice and she told me to continue use of the cream and powder (Nyamyc) even though I told her the cream seemed to make me itch and 'prickle' even more and contributed to the uncomfortable 'moisture'. I found the powder to calm the itch down enough to sleep at night and to keep the areas DRY.  My yeast infection is in the creases of my groin, and ON my vulva. A few random 'bumps' - 2 types - come and go and the whole 'area' just feels irritated.  I can't wear panties - they only aggravate the issue - I'm in nightgowns and muu muus! :(  Will it ever go away?!",LinC

It didn’t really itch with the yeast infection and now it’s itchy all the time whenever I use this cream,Alex
