1,Fluconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 11, 2022",0,"I am 43 female and this was my first yeast infection. I was reluctant on taking this med because I am typically an all natural remedy person but the itching and burning was so intense I thought I was going to go insane! After reading reviews I thought I would give it a try. I did not get relief like some within hours, it took 1 day to feel a little relief but still very itchy. It took almost 4 days before the itchy part went away. I am on day 6 and about 95% better. I did not have any side affects except day 3 there was a little time I felt dizzy and had diarrhea, not horrible though. All in all I would take this med again if I had another yeast infection. I also cannot swallow pills, but was able to break this in half (I was told I could crush it otherwise). I did also have a couple drinks and no side affects and didn't have any bad interaction. I would recommend.",Missy

It took some days to get into my doctor so the itching and burning was beyond intense. I’m hyper sensitive to most medications and was really apprehensive about taking the pill. My lady regions were completely itch free 8 hours later… Eureka! I am experiencing a severe headache and feel dizzy, and my brain just feels weird in general so I’ve kept it to light duty today and drank over 80 ounces of water so far. I’m optimistic that tomorrow I’ll wake up feeling better in that regard. This medicine for a yeast infection by far has been the best !",Anonymous

Thought was a UTI given antibiotics by day 4, burning got worse, nausea & vomiting. Two doctors one specialist. No STD, healthy cervix just what appears to be a ""mild"" yeast. Well if this is mild I shudder at severe.  Meds given flagyl 5 pills at once, sporanox 14 days, 14 day prescribed  suppositories. Canestan 3 & 7, boric acid 4 days, probiotic suppositories 3 days, monistat 7, sporanec 3 day 12 pills. Nothing worked, Diflucan 150 mg for 3 days no change as yet, burning continues now slight fever and body aches. Called doctor says more test for Candida die off and Covid, Ha! Are doctors helping me or  harming me????I read reviews says it gets worse before it works, so I'm hopeful the Diflucan works.

I know I know it’s a bad habit lol anyways. I have keflex for UTI, and that caused a yeast infection. I thought I’d try some monistat 7 and it only got worse. Finally like three days into the monistat I was like I have to take the diflucan. I was putting it off because apparently it interacts with Zoloft but I called the pharmacist and she was like nope you’re fine take the pill. I would say about an hour after the pill, I felt relief. I was so freaking swollen, irritated, and just in pain down there. I literally wanted to cry before taking the pill. I'm so happy to finally feel relief. For me I had an upset stomach for like 30 mins, then it went away. A day or two later had a bad headache but took some ibuprofen. Also the dosage was 150 mg. Took it in the afternoon like around 3pm. Felt relief around 5pm. Easy to use, not messy like the cream, actually will work…",demtonez

I didn't think much of it and took it again two days ago to treat another YI. This time, what I experienced last time came back worse, with itching, burning, and rashes in my hands/fingers.Two of my fingers swelled up so bad that I went to the ER to check it out. They didn't seem to believe that I was allergic to the medication and diagnosed me with dactylitis (sausage fingers, lol).

I called 911 for an ambulance to rush immediately because about an hour after taking the pill, I felt like my chest was so heavy and that I could hardly breathe and noticed my heart beating super fast and then felt like it would stop/skip, repeat. I was in a full blown panic attack, blood pressure through the rough, my heart was beating so irregular and, at moments, very fast to the point I thought I was truly going to pass away right where I was.

My first choice every time is Diflucan. Sometimes I have to take more than dose, but it never fails me. For most infections, it’s a one and done treatment and the relief happens pretty quickly, usually 12-24 hours. It’s even worked on oral thrush for me! Keep in mind that the infection can take many days and even up to a week to fully clear, but the symptoms start to resolve much much sooner. Also, you’re likely to have an increase in discharge after taking this medication and my theory is that it’s the deadened infection being expelled. I highly recommend every woman to ask their doctor for some Diflucan to have on hand. It’s a lifesaver!",KatScratchFever
20,Fluconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 17, 2021",0,Recurrent yeast infection due to ANTIBIOTICS. Been taking AB because of UTI and stupidly for cold and flu. Therefore I disrupted a lot of my good bacteria and have had yeast infection twice. First time taking oral pill worked like a charm. After another antibiotic the yeast infection became more stubborn to fix. Needed 2 does of fluconazole. Sadly my boyfriend also got it from me. Don’t have sex with yeast infection - makes vagina swelling worse and delays healing. Also he can then give it back to you. Abstinence for at least 1-2 weeks.

I think it was a combination of the monistat drying the skin of my labia majora and still having a yeast infection. I took the pill for fluconazole and didn't really notice big changes until day 2. By day 2 I started having a lot of white thick discharge and itching went down. Redness didn't start fading until the 3rd day. To keep myself from wanting to itch and moisturize my dry skin I did use cortisone cream on my labia majora. I'm still on day 3 and still notice my labia minora is sensitive to touch. What I suggest when taking the pill is to drink plenty of water, change your underwear often or don't wear any at all. Let your vagina breath!

I am absolutely terrified of throwing up, so the idea of being terribly nauseous on top of all of the horrible other side effects people said they experienced was not something I wanted to intentionally do to myself by taking this pill. But I took a leap of faith and finally convinced myself to take the Fluconazole, fully anticipating the worst. I took it with food, and about an hour later I noticed the slightest of headaches and a little bit of lightheadedness. That was the worst of it. I was able to go about the rest of my day forgetting that I even took the medication.

42,Fluconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10.0,,"February 14, 2020",59,"Fluconazole is The BEST and ONLY drug that cures vaginal (and anal) yeast infections! I recently had to be prescribed antibiotics for a sinus infection, so I already knew I would get a yeast infection because I always do whenever I have to take antibiotics. Fluconazole gives me a lot of relief. What many people may not know is that antibiotics can cause other medical issues to develop while taking them, such as diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps, excessive gas, yeast infections, etc. Taking antibiotics this time resulted in me having a vaginal and anal yeast infection. I hate itching worse than being in pain! Thankfully, Fluconazole, hydrocortisone cream, and Benadryl always give me the needed relief when I deal with yeast infections.

I'm wondering if the degree of side effects are proportional to the degree of fungal invasiveness (overgrowth).  So if you have a mild case of candida overgrowth, maybe the side effects will be mild too. I took this drug about 1 1/2 years ago and had no side effects.  I know my candidiasis is worse now  than it was before, and I had side effects this time.

I took the drug a second time and again within 10-30 minutes I have extreme itching, swelling and irritation. That’s when it clicked that I was having a reaction.

The prickling lasted for about a week before it finally started to fade. I went back to the clinic 10 days later to make sure the infection was gone, and they finally couldn't find any yeast!

I was to take one, then another one in 3 days. I took the first one Wednesday night and by the next morning I had felt about 80% relief of my symptoms. By Friday I felt back to normal. I did take the second dose on Saturday as instructed. Luckily I have not experienced any side effects from this drug. This was the 2nd time in about 6 years I've had a yeast infection and I had also taken the same drug on my last infection with no issues at all.",JC

I noticed it at  at 3:00 am a couple days ago when I went to go use the bathroom, at first my whole body was itching and then my lady parts. My mom gave me fluconazole and after a couple of hours I felt a little bit better, not as itchy but definitely soreness and burning. However, the following morning it came back and I promptly made an appointment with my doctor and she prescribed me the same thing 150 mg and some cream.

The pharmacist didn’t think it was related to Diflucan because I hadn’t had a reaction before. Well, was she wrong! I had to take it again a couple of days ago and the exact allergic reaction returned (which I realise is most likely a Fixed Drug Eruption).

This time the yeast affected my GI tracy, I developed a bit of oral thrush on the tongue, then rectal itching, itchy eyes, and mucus coming out from my nose and throat as well as inconsistent bowel movements,  I was overall sick of too much yeast. I called my doc and he prescribed fluconazole, to be taken for 10 days, 100mg per day. I got severe diarrhoea, 1st 3 days but it is good cuz the yeast is coming out from your gut, then you get super sick, (flu symptoms, fever, joint pain, stomach pain, etc.) and you need to drink lots of water, and herbal teas to detox from it otherwise your liver and kidneys will suffer.

Only time I couldn't feel the symptoms was if I was laying in bed.  I took fluconazole on a Saturday afternoon.  Upon waking next morning, my symptoms seemed to be cut in half, still irritated though, itchy, and uncomfortable.  Each day after, symptoms seem to be cut in half again.  Tuesday I was feeling much better and it is now Wednesday and I feel great.  This definitely worked for me.  So glad I didn't have to take Monistat since that burns my insides!  Those who are experiencing side effects, I can only guess with fluconazaole you do not actually have a yeast infection and the pill is trying to fight something that isn't there.  Probably a different issue, maybe bacterial?  This pill definitely worked for me and I am HAPPY and back to feeling like my normal self again.",Sara

I slept the entire day and night, and each time I woke up, I went to the toilet to pee out of my bottom - yep diarrhea. I also had no appetite at all, so I drank water the entire time. Talk about feeling/being bloated! Three days later I took my second pill, and the madness began all over again. My advice: Don’t do what I did.  I took Amoxicillin (for Pneumonia), which also gave me diarrhea, for ten days, the amoxycillin gave me a yeast infection and have to take Diflucan. We have to take better care of ourselves.

106,Fluconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,8.0,,"April 2, 2019",18,"Yeast infections are a complete pain. I've been bouncing between bacterial vaginosis & yeast - the antibiotics tend to trigger yeast. I was using boric acid (made it feel all better but then yeast regrew once I stopped), then canesten cream but I could feel that crawling feeling of the infection still being there. I took the fluconazole tablet yesterday- can definitely feel the itch and discomfort fading. My theory is that fluconazole is good to kill the candida in your stomach, with one theory being that your digestive health reaches your vagina via the short distance from anal passage. I have taken fluconazole previously & felt like it did nothing but it really seems to be helping this time. If you have a persistent yeast infection just try everything- different routes, different things work. Boric acid has always been great to bring relief. Fingers crossed the issues stay away!

Over the last few years I have also developed esophageal candida and toenail fungus (as well as thrush in the vagina).  To cut a long story short, after many specialists and doctors claiming I don't have candida, I started on a course of Fluconazole 200mg a day but it kept flaring back up.  I have now increased the dosage to 400mg a day and it's working.  After many years of dealing with this problem, I have concluded that Fluconazole is fairly ineffective or is not prescribed at a high enough dose or for long enough. With the use of antibiotics, I also believe it's essential that gut health be restored with probiotics otherwise recurrent candida will keep recurring thus treating the symptoms and not the cause.",tpm

123,Fluconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 7, 2018",25,"Diflucan (fluconazole):First make sure you are being diagnosed with a yeast infection via a swab just in case it is bacterial! If that is positive for yeast, your doctor will recommend dosage and frequency, sometimes you could have outer discomfort associated and may use the external yeast cream that comes in the yeast infection otc box at the same time you’re taking the pill. Use it for at least 7 days (the external cream) no matter how many days worth of diflucan. If you are getting external symptoms, may be due to too much external cream or if you are using only pill, may be due to another infection you may have. Important to have a swab done. Probiotics aren’t necessarily the best. I recommend concentrated dose of chamomile, garlic, low to no sugar, greens, and possibly tea tree, or boric acid suppository.

That works in 3 to 5 days. Abstain from Alcohol and food high in sugar such as soda and sweets.

I guess it just depends on the person on how much you need and how your body will react.  It takes more than one dose for me.  ",Smileygirl
