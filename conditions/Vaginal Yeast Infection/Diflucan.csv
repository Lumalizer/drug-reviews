0,Diflucan,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2022",0,"I had a UTI which I’m prone too I tend to hold my pee when I am sleeping. I know I know it’s a bad habit lol anyways. I have keflex for UTI, and that caused a yeast infection. I thought I’d try some monistat 7 and it only got worse. Finally like three days into the monistat I was like I have to take the diflucan. I was putting it off because apparently it interacts with Zoloft but I called the pharmacist and she was like nope you’re fine take the pill. I would say about an hour after the pill, I felt relief. I was so freaking swollen, irritated, and just in pain down there. I literally wanted to cry before taking the pill. I'm so happy to finally feel relief. For me I had an upset stomach for like 30 mins, then it went away. A day or two later had a bad headache but took some ibuprofen. Also the dosage was 150 mg. Took it in the afternoon like around 3pm. Felt relief around 5pm. Easy to use, not messy like the cream, actually will work…",demtonez

2,Diflucan,Vaginal Yeast Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2021",0,"Glad to hear my 150mg one-time dose can cause fatigue, tachycardia, and headache as well as indigestion and heartburn. A lot of vague symptoms like shaking hands, burping, cold extremities too. I thought I had COVID again! I did drink alcohol on day 6 after taking it, which worsened my side effects severely. Now I know I only need to wait and drink a lot of ginger tea and water and keep my meals simple. This site helped me a lot. Don't drink alcohol with this, you'll regret it. No yeast infection, but now I feel sick three days after alcohol. It started with throbbing in my liver, then evolved 24 hours later into many minor, annoying symptoms.",kristine
3,Diflucan,Vaginal Yeast Infection,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 5, 2021",1,"I’ve had a problem fighting yeast infections, it comes back often. Monistat never worked for me, nor any home remedies, probiotics, or any other inserts so I’ve always been prescribed Diflucan. I never had issues until last month. I took a dose at 8:30pm (knowing it can make me crampy), but not expecting the side effects to be so aggressive. To simply explain, I felt like I was going to die, I’ve never felt this in my life. I called 911 for an ambulance to rush immediately because about an hour after taking the pill, I felt like my chest was so heavy and that I could hardly breathe and noticed my heart beating super fast and then felt like it would stop/skip, repeat. I was in a full blown panic attack, blood pressure through the rough, my heart was beating so irregular and, at moments, very fast to the point I thought I was truly going to pass away right where I was. Took again last night and the same thing happened. Many reviews compare to mine.",User1206

Fast forward to this year. I had a major yeast infection, took Diflucan but this time had multiple weird side effects, including: peeling/swollen lips (with ulcers on the inside), nausea/vomiting, terrible stomach pains and diarrhea, heart palpitations, itchy throat and increased vaginal and anal irritation. I even developed hemorrhoids for the first time in my life, and I attribute it all to this drug. I think it severely irritated my mucous membranes and then this was only worsened by coupled chronic diarrhea I was having. Be really careful taking this drug..it’s no joke.",Nicki34786

8,Diflucan,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 25, 2020",53,"So this is probably very TMI but here goes. I’ve been taking diflucan for about 3 years now. I have recurrent yeast infections due to being immunocompromised. Last year I had 9 infections. I am allergic to all over the counter yeast medicines. My labia minora is always inside my body, the over the counter medication causes my labia to come outside of my body and swell to the size of bigger than a golf ball. This medication saves me so much. When I take it, it’s like magic. I notice improvement within an hour. Usually only takes a day and it’s gone completely. Before I knew of it’s existence I would use Apple cider vinegar. Don’t do that. It burns bad. It killed the yeast but started giving me BV. So thankful for this medication.",Sakura
9,Diflucan,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2020",158,"Fluconazole: Brand name Diflucan worked like magic for me.  It sounds like a yeast infection may have been the wrong diagnosis for some of you all judging from the symptoms or the yeast infection may have been more severe which may have called for a double dose on the first day vs. the  one dose of 150mg.  What helped me was drinking plenty of water to flush the medicine through my system, eating yogurt with probiotics, urinating as much as possible, and flushing my exterior vulva with cool water for relief to rinse the yeast from my skin.  (((Do not rub or scratch  your vulva because that contributes to swelling, inflammation, and irritation ))).  Sit on the toilet or tub and rinse with a large cup of cool water and pat dry. I AVOIDED ALCOHOL FOR AT LEAST ONE WEEK while the antibiotic took its course. I was healed completely in less than 3-4 days.",Anastacia

11,Diflucan,Vaginal Yeast Infection,,,"December 19, 2019",63,"I took a course of antibiotics for BV and ended up getting a yeast infection. I went back to the clinic where they have me a 3 day course of Terconazole, it helped but didn't clear the infection completely. Such a pain! So back to the clinic I went where they gave me 2 doses of Fluconazole, one to take right away and another to take 3 days later. I didn't notice an immediate improvement like many of these other reviews. About 24 hours after taking the first dose I noticed a lot of prickling down there, kind of like sandpaper. The prickling lasted for about a week before it finally started to fade. I went back to the clinic 10 days later to make sure the infection was gone, and they finally couldn't find any yeast! I still feel a bit sore and scratchy, but at least I know it is from the infection healing and not more yeast. Didn't have any major side effects, just felt really tired after a few days. Overall Im happy with Fluconazole, but the curing and healing process is very gradual.",Alynn
12,Diflucan,Vaginal Yeast Infection,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 26, 2019",32,"I am prone to yeast infections. Not super prone. But I usually get about 3 yeast infections a year, more if I have infections that require antibiotics. Rarely does over the counter medication work for me, plus I just hate how gross, messy, and how long it takes to clear up with the over the counter suppositories. This medication  Diflucan is really a god send because the minute I feel it coming on I take it and symptoms are gone super quickly and with NO MESS. I honestly don't notice any side effects. I might get an upset stomach but I usually get that from the antibiotics that give me the yeast infection to begin with.",Rivalry

Took 1 pill yesterday and paid attention!!! Yep! Ugh! Hives and allergic reaction not on the list! I get hives, my knuckle swells on 1 finger and it is painful.

After sleeping I now only have residual chest pain when I breathe. I have an irregular heart beat and a condition that makes the muscles in between my ribs spasm and cause chest pain similar to this.

I recently needed to take it again earlier this year and my upper lip became swollen with a tiny sore/blister on the underside of my lip. The right of my face was also slightly swollen and numb. The pharmacist didn’t think it was related to Diflucan because I hadn’t had a reaction before. Well, was she wrong! I had to take it again a couple of days ago and the exact allergic reaction returned (which I realise is most likely a Fixed Drug Eruption). This time, my upper lip is much worse with a sore in the same spot and it’s taking longer to disappear. Both times I’ve been taking antihistamine to help.If you experience an allergic reaction after taking Diflucan, think very carefully about taking it again.",FDE

I took it again a couple of weeks later and the same thing happened again hearts in the exact same place lip swollen except this time it took longer to go away and I could barely breathe.

Twelve hours after taking the Diflucan, I developed 3 hives- two on my face and one on my thumb.   I thought maybe it was from something else or stress, so I ignored it.  Big mistake.   Had to take a second pill this week, and the hives came back in the exact same places, only worse, and have blistered.  I also now have blisters inside my mouth and one my lips.   They are extremely painful and are healing, but still there after 6 days.   I expect scarring.   If you have an allergic reaction to this drug DO NOT take it again.   It only gets worse.

Diflucan has been great for me so far!! I was prescribed two 150mg tablets— one to take ASAP, and the other to take three days later. I’m on day 2 of the pill being in my system, and let me tell you, although it takes a while for the pill to kick in, it really does work!!! Now, this didn’t work a mere couple hours later for me, I didn’t start to feel relief until this morning, but a little over 24 hours after ingesting the pill, and the burning has completely gone away :) the itchiness is still prevalent, although it has subsided GREATLY. I’m still a bit sore, but that’s to be expected with a really bad yeast infection. The only side effects that I’ve really noticed with this pill are that it did leave a small patch of dry skin near my mouth (but as an eczema sufferer, this is nothing crazy for me to handle lol), and it really will give you the poops.",begone itch

The OTC creams do not work. Diflucan has been a life saver...up until recently. I noticed they have changed the pill - visually at least. Since the change I have needed 2 or 3 doses for it to be effective. The one that comes in a blister pack seems to work much better than the multi dose that comes in a pill bottle.

The second one my doctor saw during my annual pap. I told her I thought I had one and she said she thought I was correct. She tested me for other infections,  but it was in fact yeast. So she prescribed Diflucan and gave me 2 pills. I took one that day and one 3 days later. I started noticing an improvement within 24 hours. Let me say that the burning and itching from the yeast infections were SO SEVERE. I even questioned my 10 year partner about his fidelity because I wondered if I had somehow contracted an STI. (Not to his face) I'm not proud of that. It wasn't long, about a month later and I got ANOTHER yeast infection and this one, the burning was even worse. I emailed my doctor and she sent a prescription in to the pharmacy. The Diflucan worked the same started working in about 24 hours.",Georgia
29,Diflucan,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 7, 2018",25,"First make sure you are being diagnosed with a yeast infection via a swab just in case it is bacterial! If that is positive for yeast, your doctor will recommend dosage and frequency, sometimes you could have outer discomfort associated and may use the external yeast cream that comes in the yeast infection otc box at the same time you’re taking the pill. Use it for at least 7 days (the external cream) no matter how many days worth of diflucan. If you are getting external symptoms, may be due to too much external cream or if you are using only pill, may be due to another infection you may have. Important to have a swab done. Probiotics aren’t necessarily the best. I recommend concentrated dose of chamomile, garlic, low to no sugar, greens, and possibly tea tree, or boric acid suppository. ( make sure it is administered correctly). Too much of one probiotic could be harmful if your body already has an abundance of one. Try other remedies. Hope this helps!",Lizzy

I am not sure if it was just the diflucan that got rid of it, as I decided to take a double dose of probiotic the same day, but whatever it was seemed to work.",Sam33093
