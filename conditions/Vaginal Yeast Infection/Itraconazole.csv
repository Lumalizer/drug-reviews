3,Itraconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,10.0,,"June 21, 2017",35,"Sporanox (itraconazole):It worked wonders for me, I suffer from severe constipation which causes thrush from time to time & I would use the cream after a few days the infection will occur again my doctor put me on sporanox for seven days one tablet a day & it since has never returned once I completed my treatment that was over a year ago. This is the best yeast infection treatment I would be an advocate for it.",Billionarie_Goddess

5,Itraconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,,,"April 8, 2012",53,Sporanox (itraconazole):I definitely recommend Sporanox because it worked well for me without side effects. My doc placed me on it for 7 days and then another 7 day repeat if symptoms persist; which it did. Upon completion of my 14 days (2 capsules once daily) I had no symptoms. It is now 2 going on 3 wks later and I haven't relapsed with any of the symptoms or anything indicating the yeast infection returning.,sparedbeauty
