0,Methotrexate,Scleroderma,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 2, 2021",3,"Horrendous experience.  Passing out, stomach pains, vomiting, heart palpitations, sweating, problems with concentration and speech, muscle aches and exhaustion (sleeping all day and through the night), breathlessness, headache, irrational thoughts that worsened each week.  I was sacked from my job as I couldn't function when on this drug.  Doctors still keep pushing me to recommence but I resist as I feel so much better not on this medication and continue to improve as each month passes.  I had no quality of life when complying with 'treatment', at least I have a decent quality of life now (methotrexate free for over 6 months!)",Eve
1,Methotrexate,Scleroderma,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 13, 2015",15,"I have morphea, or what they call localized scleroderma.  This condition causes red, brown and white patches on the skin, but no other real physical symptoms, so it's very hard for me to justify staying on this medication for 3 months, when it makes me feel so run down.  It makes me feel cold, tired, and always like I'm coming down with something.  Not sure how long I'll be able to handle these side effects.",Leeia
