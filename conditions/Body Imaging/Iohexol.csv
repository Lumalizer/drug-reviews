0,Iohexol,Body Imaging,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 11, 2020",1,I had two injections in my L4 & L5 separated by one month. The first injection was so painful I opted for sedation the second time. The assistant gave the the IV sedative just second before the procedure started so I knew there was not way this was going to work.The same doctor did the second injection and and he could say was he was sorry while the whole crew was talking about food day. I was in horrific pain. It's been three days since the second injection and my hip and leg pain is exactly as it was when I went in. I think this is just a hoax to get money from Medicaire and personal insurance. I am so angry about the whole experience. I can't wait to get my survey.,GrammaOC

3,Iohexol,Body Imaging,1.0,,"March 30, 2018",8,"Omnipaque 300 (iohexol):I had a CT & omnipaque and about 4 hours later I had extreme anxiety, panic, I couldn't fall asleep- I  basically had insomnia, every thing I would think of was bad like I was going to die. My mind was racing. The next day I still couldn't sleep and I tried going outside and every thing in the world seemed NOT REAL! I had depersonalization and crying I felt like I was going crazy literally no control over my mind. My next panic/anxiety attack happened about 1 1/2 weeks later the day before I was leaving on vacation and ever since then I've been having panic attacks, anxiety, depression, blurred vision, stiff neck, constant dizziness plus when I touch my head I get dizzy sensation, my eyes tremble a lot, racing heart beat, breathing problems, depersonalization, crying from sadness, I forget things, people and names, my mind sometimes blacks out and forget what I'm even doing. I know this med caused this I've never had any of these symptoms before.",Lupe
4,Iohexol,Body Imaging,,,"November 19, 2016",7,Omnipaque 300 (iohexol):I hate when you think you can trust a Doctor you say you have a little stomach ache and it turns out they lie in the paper work so they can put your Drugs into our body Trusting this Dr hoping he is doing what is going to make you feel better  . I am a Diebetic 1 & A Kidney Transplant Patient Not Sure my Dr Should of used this Medicine Damit!!!! What it turns out to be is he is just running several test to make hospitals $$$ not helping you as the Patient at all Just turning you into some type of gene  pig trying to destroys the precious Kidney your husband of 43 years donated to you so we can enjoy more loving years together Hey Drug companies grow up use your new drugs on your self and let us alone ... Very unhappy that test are being done on people like me that shouldn't have any additional drug because my Blood test are in Range. GOOD BYE,Debra Nielsen
5,Iohexol,Body Imaging,7.0,,"August 24, 2016",10,Omnipaque 350 (iohexol):Had a precautionary CT scan on my chest several days after hip surgery and after experiencing some pain in my  chest. The contrast agent used was Omnipaque 350. About 8 hours later when lying down in bed I felt itching on my back which persisted into the night. On inspection I could see that a hives type rash had formed between my shoulder blades. This gradually subsided over about 10 days.Note that the scan showed up a small infection for which I was prescribed a penicillin antibiotic. I took this about 3 hours before the rash appeared so my doctor changed the antibiotic as a precaution in case that caused the rash. I have never been allergic to penicillin  so in my mind the Omnipaque remains the culprit,"Pete, UK"
