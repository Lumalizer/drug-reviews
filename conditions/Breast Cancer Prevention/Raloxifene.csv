Hot flashes are my biggest complaint, mornings, days and nights. Does not matter what time I take my doses..... unfortunately this does not prevent breast cancer only prevents the particular cell type found from reproducing.  Time to discontinue ... 3 years of severe hot flashes- yikes!",Radgrl

I found that I can not drink alcohol. I become very nauseated and throw up. Otherwise I have taken it for almost 3 years without any real problem.",shibumi0202
