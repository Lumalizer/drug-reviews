0,Zoledronic acid,Hypercalcemia of Malignancy,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 28, 2020",31,Zometa (zoledronic acid):My oncologist ordered this as a bone treatment. I was doing just fine without it. Now my legs are in pain and I'm tired most of the time. I will NEVER take this crap again.  It's a typical poison that America's corrupt pharmaceutical industry pushes on people.  There are other safer ways to get your damaged bones to absorb calcium. I have nothing but the most profound contempt for the makers of this product.,Bluehighways
1,Zoledronic acid,Hypercalcemia of Malignancy,7.0,,"June 15, 2019",11,Zometa (zoledronic acid):I had Brest cancer 2017 and chemotherapy and radiotherapy in 2018. I am now on zoledronic acid every 6 months for 3years.  I've had 3 now.  The thing is the right side of my tummy is swollen from just above my belly button and over to my right side. I've had a CT scan and everything is fine. Bloods are fine. It swelled up after my 2nd one and no one knows why.,Blue eyed
2,Zoledronic acid,Hypercalcemia of Malignancy,,,"November 26, 2017",22,"Zometa (zoledronic acid):Went the day before Thanksgiving for my regular shots for my  neuroendocrine tumors (NETs)/Carcinoid Syndrome wwith mets to liver. Nurse said a ""calcium drip"" had been ordered. I figured it was a type of vitamin, although the nurse said some people get mild flu symptoms. I left 40 mins. Later, went home to houseful of guests. (I'm the cook for record in our family)About 10:00 that night I felt like a ton of bricks had hit me! The chills, uncontrollable shaking, and violent vomiting began. Every bone and joint in my body ached. I'm now 4 days past treatment and I'm still just ""off"". I'm having trouble searching for words, forgetful, & inexplicably depressed. (sobbing for no reason?)I, too, like the previous post, am furious with my doctor. NEVER AGAIN.",SmitedinIndy
