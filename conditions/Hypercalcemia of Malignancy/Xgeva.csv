0,Xgeva,Hypercalcemia of Malignancy,1,,"December 17, 2016",34,"I have Lung cancer w/ mets to bone.  Two hours after the injection, I experienced the worst pain ever in my life! I walked into the infusion area without any body pain, just a very slight back ache which advil was helping, and 2 hours later I was crippled.  It's 2 weeks now & I'm either in a wheelchair or walking around the house with a cane.  Horrible, horrible medication.  i now take oxycontine every 12 hours and  oxycodone every 3 hours.  Refuse this drug if you are smart.  Even my oncologist is ""surprised"" with the side effects I have.  I refuse to have a second injection of xgeva.",AW NJ
