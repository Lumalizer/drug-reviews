0,Denosumab,Hypercalcemia of Malignancy,1,,"December 17, 2016",34,"Xgeva (denosumab):I have Lung cancer w/ mets to bone.  Two hours after the injection, I experienced the worst pain ever in my life! I walked into the infusion area without any body pain, just a very slight back ache which advil was helping, and 2 hours later I was crippled.  It's 2 weeks now & I'm either in a wheelchair or walking around the house with a cane.  Horrible, horrible medication.  i now take oxycontine every 12 hours and  oxycodone every 3 hours.  Refuse this drug if you are smart.  Even my oncologist is ""surprised"" with the side effects I have.  I refuse to have a second injection of xgeva.",AW NJ
1,Denosumab,Hypercalcemia of Malignancy,6,,"June 20, 2016",2,"After breast cancer I had to go on Prolia to counter act the possible fractures caused by my cancer meds. My PCD noticed my PTH levels were off the charts and sent me for  a CT scan.My numbers went down after 5 months post Prolia. They went up pre 2nd shot of Prolia. I went to Mayo Clinic because I needed an answer. The endocrinologists there stated point blank that the high PTH is common with Prolia, but that Prolia outways the possibile fractures weak bones can cause. So I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't. He told me to up my Calcium and take 1000 units of Vitamin D /daily.",mmclamm
2,Denosumab,Hypercalcemia of Malignancy,1,,"April 29, 2015",7,"I began a monthly regime of xgeva injections in January 2015. After the third month, I found out I needed dental work. My oral surgeon told me that the work I needed done was extremely risky while on this medicine because denosumab prevents the bone from rebuilding itself. If they had to pull my tooth there was a chance that the hole left would never heal and my doctor said that that situation would be 10 times worse than my cancer. The really shocking thing is that getting off this medicine for a month or two before a dental procedure is almost pointless because it stays in your system for up to 15 years! I don't know anyone who can go 15 years without ever needing dental work. Also, if I break a bone, it would never heal.",jds8709
