1,Azathioprine,Autoimmune Hepatitis,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 6, 2020",16,"Imuran (azathioprine):I have been on Azathioprine for over 20 years, along with Prednisone when I have a flare of Autoimmune Hepatitis.  A couple times the Dr tried to lower my doses and each time I  flared. Azathioprine has been  a life saver.",Ccm
2,Azathioprine,Autoimmune Hepatitis,10,,"November 28, 2019",20,"Was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis in '06.  Been on azapthioprine for 12 years.  No problems, no side effects",Kk
3,Azathioprine,Autoimmune Hepatitis,7,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 28, 2019",12,"Was on Azathioprine for 4-5 years it got my liver numbers down and kept them down. But into the 5th year I ask to try weaning off or lowering dosage, I was constantly getting sick. It seemed that I was being knocked down at least once a month from a cold or just complete fatigue. I also noticed if I went in highly public areas, stores or restaurants I would be laid up the next two days. I did good at lower dosage then stopped taking all together for almost 2 years. I sub-stained knee injuries and required pain medication until then along with lidocaine patches my numbers spiked to 300’s and quickly so I’m back on the Azathioprine. Hopefully I will be able to go off again after healing or something that won’t over suppress my immune system to point I cannot be out in public will come along.",Lee
4,Azathioprine,Autoimmune Hepatitis,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 2, 2018",14,"I was diagnosed in 2015.  Prednisone until levels came under control and they added the Azathioprine to 'keep me there'.  Worked great, levels always in line, made a general conversational comment about getting older- almost 60- and feeling a little 'foggy' on name recall.They  took me off immediately out of concerns around memory loss.  I don't know if an actual side effect or just getting older. But now struggling to find a replacement.  My experience positive until recently but I think I want to give it another try and just monitor more closely.  I had NO side effects from the Azathioprine other than that potential.",Big BZ
