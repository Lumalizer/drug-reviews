0,Budesonide,Autoimmune Hepatitis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 21, 2020",4,"After 3 years on prednisone for Autoimmune Hepatitis , I have been switched to budesonide for another 3 years. I started at 9mg and eventually tapered to 3mg. I lost all of my prednisone weight (20lbs) in about 3 months. My moon face went away. My hair started growing straight again. It has been amazing to get relief from these side effects. Even better, my liver enzymes are lower than ever!",AIHer
1,Budesonide,Autoimmune Hepatitis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 10, 2020",4,"I have been on this steroid budesonide for almost 6 months, taking 2 pills a day at 3 mg each.   I have issues with red spotted dots under the skin, blurry vision that comes and goes, just started having my hair getting thin, a little swelling in the ankles, easy bruising, puffiness under the eyes, and I want to get off of them.  I am gonna get to the bottom of why the REAL reason and cause if liver enzymes issues.  A friend of mine had hormone issues, DHEA issues and has hashimoto disease,  all of this elevated her liver enzymes.  I am planning to have the same tests she had done to see what and if there are any issues with me also.",Annie
2,Budesonide,Autoimmune Hepatitis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 6, 2018",8,"Changed to Budesonide from prenisolone as I couldn't tolerate the side effect of the pred.  I've been taking 3 mg of budesnonide for autoimmune hepatitis, for the past 5 weeks.  I'm  feeling very tired to the point of exhaustion, nauseous, bruising easily, moon face and various other mild aches and pains and feeling very low spirited. Some days worse than others. Hoping to come of this drug soon, but worried about feeling worse through the reduction phase.",Jaggie18

4,Budesonide,Autoimmune Hepatitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 21, 2016",22,"I was on Prednisone, 60 mg. for about 6 months after being diagnosed with AIH.  During that time I had many severe side effects but my liver enzyme numbers were coming down.  My physician switched me to 9 mg. Budesonide because of the side effects.  I had no more side effects and my liver enzymes continued to go down.  Now, I am off all steroids and my liver enzymes are in the low normal range using only Azathioprine.  I had one flare two years ago after surgery and a few months of Budesonide brought me right back where I needed to be.  I agree that the cost is outrageous.",Nummy
5,Budesonide,Autoimmune Hepatitis,10.0,,"May 6, 2013",28,"I had been on prednisone for almost 10 years. With many of the common side effects; round face, always gaining weight and others. I am now on budesonide tablets, 6mg per day. With no side effects. It truly is a miracle. My only complaint of this medicine is it's outrageous cost. I say this, because the medicine has been around since the early nineties in inhalers. I know this, because my wife did clinical trials with this. My last month's bill was $360. for a thirty day script, I might add, with Humana insurance. Each month the cost has gone up. I am afraid to think of what next month's bill is going to be. The budesonide has given me known side effects. ",MJohns
6,Budesonide,Autoimmune Hepatitis,7.0,,"July 24, 2011",39,"I have been taking budesonide Entocort since Feb 1, 2011.  It was prescribed by my hepatologist for treatment of my autoimmune hepatitis.  Nothing else I have taken has worked effectively (prednisone gave me ocular migraines along with azathioprine (nausea).  Cellcept was tolerated but wasn't effective.  Prograf (for transplant patients) did not work either and I had too many side effect (ended up getting shingles).  I do have problems with dizziness but this is the only medicine that have brought my liver values down.  I have noticed red rashes that come and go.  Medicine is very expensive but fortunately my insurance covers the majority of it.",Desti
