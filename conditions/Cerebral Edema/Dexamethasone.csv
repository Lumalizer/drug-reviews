1,Dexamethasone,Cerebral Edema,1.0,,"August 30, 2018",22,"I was put Dexamethasone to treat Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis aka blood clots in my brain. It was prescribed to reduce inflammation in my brain. I was put on such a high dose that I shook like a leaf in the wind. I felt like I was jittering inside of my body. I took my doses 4 times a day for 8+ weeks before we began to taper down from the stuff. I was on it for 12 weeks in total. I ended up putting on 80 pounds of water weight. My face was so swollen that I couldn't see more than a foot in front of me through my blurry slits for eyes. I slept maybe 3-4 hours a night if I was lucky. I dripped with the cold sweats, literally. I ended up on water pills, along with 9 other medications. It took at least 6 months, and out patient therapy to recover from depression side effects. My body has never fully recovered from this medication. I have had issues including a buffalo hump and some bone loss. Spare yourself the pain and trauma.",Samoth
2,Dexamethasone,Cerebral Edema,2.0,,"February 15, 2017",15,"I had a seizure which led to them finding a brain tumor. They put me on dexa in the ER and was on it for 2 months after the craniotomy to prevent brain swelling. Don't quite remember the dosing, it was a 1mg or 2mg pill I took 2 or 3 times a day. I had insomnia (slept maybe 3 hours a night even on two percocet every 4 hours), painful acne all over my face and back, mood swings, crazy hunger and weight gain, erectile dysfunction, headaches and joint pain. I suppose it did what it was supposed to, but the side effects were horrible. Even if I had another tumor, I don't think I'd ever use it again.",OldGreg

A rapid progress was achieved within a day. Operated on the next day for a brain tumour biopsy any have been on it ever since. Just completed my first cycle of chemo - one bag over 3-4 hours then 3-4 days of a rescue medicine intravenously to strip it out of my system.
