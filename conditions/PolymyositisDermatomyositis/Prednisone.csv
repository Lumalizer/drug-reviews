0,Prednisone,PolymyositisDermatomyositis,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 11, 2018",3,"I developed pain and stiffness which was worst in my shoulder area. I am 69 years old, healthy, normal weight and exercise regularly. It was so bad that I needed my wife to help me get dressed. My wife dragged me to our GP doctor. He sent me for a blood test and correctly suspected Polymyalgia Rheumatica. I started 10 mg per day prednisone. Within 24 hours I was much improved. After one week I stopped taking the prednisone and the condition returned. My doctor sent me to a Rheumatologist. She put me on 15mg daily reducing the dose by 2-1/2mg per week. I was great until I got down to 5mg when some adverse symptoms returned. I will stay on the 5mg until I return to the Rheumatologist in three weeks. This has been a miracle drug for me. I have observed no side effects.",Jessek
