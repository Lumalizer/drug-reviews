0,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 26, 2022",2,I've been an opiate addict for 20 years now. After 5 years on Suboxone I was looking for a new solution. I ended up going with Sublocade.  I had two 300mg injections and one 100mg. It's been 2 months now since my last injection and I'm still feeling great. The only side effects I had while on the injection was tiredness and constipation. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is ready to be sober.,Katy03
1,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 18, 2022",1,I’ve had the best possible outcome with the sublocade shot. it saved my life! I definitely recommend it to any and everyone with opioid dependent treatment!!,dspjr
2,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 15, 2022",2,"Getting the Sublocade Shot has been the best decision I've ever made. Had a bad H addiction for about 6 years. This shot has been a life saver. Going on my 3rd shot and completely sober and couldn't feel any better. The shot has kept me from getting the usual depression that seems to come no matter what, the first few months of being sober. For the first time in a while I look forward to life. No cravings, no withdrawal. I highly recommend sublocade, my only regret is not getting on this sooner.",MJ1
3,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 15, 2022",4,"I started on Suboxone 2 years ago. It was fine. No side effects really except constipation. I didn't like taking it daily,  the whole routine of it, and absolutely didn't like the taste. So I switched to sublocade. I didn't notice the transition except being really tired for about two months. I have nothing but good things to say about it and it's kept me opiate/heroin free for two years. I have absolutely no desire to use so I've decided to go off sublocade cold turkey. After reading the reviews I'm quite confident.",Pretty in red
4,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 14, 2022",1,"After many years on ~10 mg Subutex, I switched to a provider that offered Sublocade injections. I had lost most of my previous prescription during a move and decided I didn't want to live always afraid my pills would be lost/stolen, random U/A tests, random pill counts. I received my first injection and except for some tiredness (difficulty staying awake on grave shifts), I had no side-effects. I was prepared to complete the series. When I arrived to my appointment for my second shot, it was not there. The specialty pharmacy would not release it b/c my name on my ins and ss card is spelled differently than on my license and birth cert. I would need a legal name change in order to get the injection released to my provider. So, my doc put me back on the Subutex to start when withdrawal symptoms began. I took a small piece of a pill here and there, but never experienced any real discomfort. This was in Nov. I haven't had a shot, any Subutex or any withdrawal since. I am finally DONE!",Hapless
5,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 27, 2022",3,"Best decision I’ve ever made, been on suboxone 12mg for years, maybe 10 years or so, but on my second 300mg shot and the whole last month had been a breeze, never felt better hope it continues!",KCM
6,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 13, 2022",3,"I have been addicted to opioids for almost 10 years. I have been in and out of rehab, on methadone and prescribed Suboxone. With the help of an all women’s rehab and the Sublocade shot I feel amazing. The cravings are gone and I haven’t thought about drugs like I used to while taking suboxone. I am beyond grateful for this. The numbing shot pinches and the medicine can sting but it is worth it. I am afraid of the withdrawals-but for right now, it’s not broken so I’m not going to try and fix it!",Life saver
7,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 15, 2021",2,"So sublocade was really working for me after being on suboxone for a while. I didn’t have to think about taking strips every day and didn’t have ups and downs. But I did some research on the ingredients on what is in sublocade and in the gel, it consists of NMP, a solvent used in paint thinners. Known for reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity, and known to cause miscarriages among many other side effects. NMP is banned in Europe as a poisonous chemical. When I read this,  ( look at FDA website for ingredients, and other reputable website for further information) I felt so betrayed that doctors and the FDA has allowed this to be put into our bodies. I will no longer use sublocade and switch back to suboxone. I want to have a family someday and have no idea what other things could happen after long term use of this chemical in my body. I just want you to all be aware. There is other options. If not suboxone, methadone. Good luck!",Yougotthis
8,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 22, 2021",5,"I took Suboxone for nearly 15 years.  I loved that it gave my life back, however when trying to quit the withdrawals was horrible.  Just recently I took a 100 mg injection of sublocade for one month.  Now, it has been nearly a month since the sublocade ran out and I have felt great.  I really haven’t had any withdrawals, besides maybe a hot flash here and there.  Nothing that I couldn’t handle and nothing like any other withdrawals I’ve had before. No others withdrawals and now it’s over and I’m living a blessed life.  It’s amazing.",Anonymous
9,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 6, 2021",2,I echo pretty much all of the reviews here. I had my first 300 mg injection about ten days ago. It burned like anything through the entire injection. It’s definitely working because I haven’t had any withdrawals and it’s nice not to live waiting for my next strip. I like knowing that I can’t over take it like I’d done with strips. My issue here is about the wound. I tried to attach a photo but couldn’t. I’ve got this ugly black/yellow scab surrounded by a red ring. The whole thing measures about 3-1/2 cm. Any feedback? Not sure if it’s a normal reaction.,Ree
10,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 24, 2021",3,"I was addicted to opiates for just a short time, maybe 2 years if that. Then I was introduced to the suboxone program. Did that program for 5+years. I didn’t think about a opiates since. After 5+ years on suboxone I was tired of having those strips take first priority of my life. Finally I seen this brochure on the doctors desk. Caught my interest immediately. Took it home, googled information and started to read the reviews. All I read was positive. I said I’m going to give it a try bc I hated having to take 2strips a day and obsessing about it. I finally got the shot and man oh man it was the best move I could of ever made for myself. Tomorrow I get my 2nd 100mg dose. Im hoping to get off of this completely. I don’t want to take maintenance medicine for the rest of my life. I hope and pray it’s easier than the suboxone. That withdrawal is no joke. Fingers crossed.",Dane
11,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,8.0,,"August 24, 2021",2,"I have been on suboxone and/or subutex for 10 years. I had a heroine/ opioid addiction for about 2 years before that.  Being on buprenorphine did give me back a life. I went to college, built a business for myself and have been there for my family and child. I have wanted to get off this med for a long time but afraid of withdrawal.  So I've taken the sublocade injection 6 times now. First 2 were 300 mg and now 100 mg. I DO NOT like how I feel on sublocade at all. But it does work for keeping me away from taking a pill every day. The first week of the injection is always the hardest because I am extremely irritable.  Then its starts to wear off the 3rd and 4th week I feel calmer. I don't want to get this injection anymore,  but it has helped me to get away from buprenorphine.  I go to a therapist, and that has been the most helpful thing to have success in recovery.",Cass

13,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,,,"August 23, 2021",2,"I've been on the shot for 13 months. It’s good and all sure. But I have experienced brutal, horrifying, gut-wrenching, withdrawals from the injection when I have stopped taking it in the past. I don’t understand why. No one seems to have experienced this. It has happened twice now. The first time something happened with the pharmacy and my injection was 2 weeks late getting delivered (covid) and at like day 10…I was doing my damn thing, going about my damn business, and all of a sudden I felt a little chill down my spine, with a rush of heat, and BOOM I just start projectile vomiting and legit pooping myself. This wasn’t a gradual come on people. It didn’t start with a yawn, a teary eye, and then HOURS later you start puking and pooping. No no no. This was something like PREcip withdrawals people. I went from 0-100 within 10 minutes. It took three 8mg strips to get me back to normal.",Anonymous

OK it was alright for a couple of days however can barely do 'daily chores' let alone concentrate @ work now. Been on Buph' for nigh on a decade so feel this is just prolonging withdrawals. Going back to a weekly script ASAP (hopefully) as was put back to 'Daily Supervised' which is the reason chose this in the 1st place. Was recommended it though, but everyone I know on this are (more or less) still using anyway! Not enough info on this lethargic stuff, but if it 'works for you' then all the BEST..",Nicky Cotton
15,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 13, 2021",0,"I just got my first injection today so I plan on giving updates of my experience. A bit about my history. I became addicted to pain medication after multiple surgeries in the early 2000’s. I am also a recovering alcoholic sober since 1986. I started on suboxone around 2012 and had to switch to subutex because my legs began swelling and had bumps on them, were red and warm to the touch. They assumed I was allergic to an ingredient in the suboxone. As it turns out, I am sensitive to the manufacturer so if I take suboxone or subutex manufactured by Hi-Tech I don’t have the swelling.  Other manufacturers have caused an allergic reaction.  I receive care at the VA and they constantly switch manufacturers so my Dr. suggested I try sublocade. I received my first 300 mg injection today. I have a high tolerance to pain so the burning others describe was not as bad as I thought it would be. It only lasted like maybe 30 seconds and I was ready to go. I will update as time passes.",Grateful
16,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,10.0,,"August 4, 2021",1,I was on subutex for a little over a year for MAT. I wanted to stop taking it so badly but was terrified of withdrawals. I’m also a single mother so laying in bed sick was not an option for me. My doctor recommended sublocade and it was one the best decisions I’ve ever made. I went from 8mg of subutex a day to NONE. Did I mentioned I only got one injection? That’s right! ONE! And I’ve have ZERO WITHDRAWALS. This medication was truly a miracle for me.,B
17,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 13, 2021",4,"First off, I was on Suboxone for close to 3 years and I believed it saved my life. Then when my doctors said I would be a good candidate for the monthly injection of Sublocade I was very interested. Weeks later after it was all set up I received my first 300mg injection and have been on 300mg injections now for 6 months. I feel great and safe and ready to continue to take life head on. I highly recommend Suboxone treatment over Methadone for those who need opiates maintenance therapy and then once you have been on Suboxone for a good standing I highly recommend Sublocade injection therapy.  it's not easy and it will have it's hard times but just hang in there and you will see that it's all worth the time and energy you put into into.",NW49ERSFAN
18,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,10.0,,"June 27, 2021",4,"Hi everyone, I was on Suboxone for 2 years and about 9 months ago I decided I had enough. I was taking 8-10mg daily. Luckily my clinic started carrying Sublocade last year. The Sublocade injection burns, and I mean it really burns! My advice is to tell them to inject it slowly. First injection the guy pumped it in fast, which caused it to be almost unbearable for me. The second injection was done slower and it was a lot better. Though, as soon as they pull out it's like the burning sensation rushes to where it was injected. I mean they did just inject this viscous liquid into your stomach. I got my first one at a dose of 300mg back in Feb 2021. The second injection was also 300mg, and everything after that is 100mg. I decided to try and just do 3/100mg shots and then not get another. You would stay on 100mg for as long as you want. I know that it will not be pleasant getting off, and I will try to come back and update. That's all I have. Good luck on your journey, everyone!",SecondChanceAtLife
19,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,9.0,,"June 1, 2021",1,"I’ve been on Suboxone for over 20 years.Down to 2mg per day. These days I just use it to take the edge off... but I’m really sick of it TBH. Although I like the buzz I get from it.. I’m tired of having to take it all the time. I don’t really get very sick from withdrawals but it is uncomfortable , with the usual sweats , cramps and headaches. I’m hoping this will make it easier.  I saw all your success stories.. so I figured what’s the worst that could happen?They started me on 64mg Subudole.They said it’s similar to Subucade but smaller doses for lower mg addicts. The dose definitely hurts (ouch!) but it goes away within 10min.ATM I feel ok a few hours later.  I definitely still have a buzz so all good so far.  I just want to live life free of this crap for once. Also I’m on Effexor which I’ve been able to get down to 75mg but I’m not going to lower that until I’m off subs completely. So far so good.",FFsti
20,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 28, 2021",4,"Just had my 1st  Sublocade injection few days ago. It BURNED so bad going in, it felt like fire under my skin. That afternoon, I was leaning over my armrest in my car to pay for my food and briefly hit my injection site, it felt like I was injected all over again, intense burning. It has been 3 days and I have not had any cravings nor withdraw symptoms. If you can stand to over look the pain from the injection site, redness, itching, burning from the medication, then it is a pretty good alternative to taking the pills or film every day. I have a way to go before fully sold, but I will update you on my after my 3rd injection, I will be on the maintenance dose. So I pray it all works out because I would like to use the sublocade to come off Suboxone for good within a year or two, if all goes well. Not worrying about having to take my Suboxone everyday, having it out of sight, out of mind can be a game changer, if it holds up and I don’t experience any major side effects or withdrawals.",JesusIsLord86

Today I woke up feeling a bit tired and body a bit achy but nothing I can’t deal with but over all I’m very happy with the way I’m feeling! My first injection was 300mg and my next will be another 300mg and than my third will be 100mg and I’m planning on not taking a 4th! I will keep everybody updated throughout my process..but if there’s anybody thinking about getting the injection DO IT! I know the feeling of waking up everyday and dealing with having to put film under your tongue just to feel normal it sucks! And it’s the worst...plus before I decided to get on the sublocade I read hundreds of reviews and they all say the same thing on how great it’s working for them so I did it and it’s the best thing I could have ever have done guys!,Junior0718

Not going to a pharmacy every day, only having to get injected once a month. This injection stays in your body for a long period of time.

26,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,10.0,,"January 16, 2021",6,"SUBOXONE is 100% more addicting and was extremely terrible withdrawals. Now sublocade is one of those things you need to be sure your want sobriety. You can’t abuse it, you can’t use on it. I was nervous I would withdrawal, I didn’t! Sober for 4 years now. 0 cravings! 300 mg isn’t equivalent to 24mgs on suboxone. I was only on 6 mg’s so being on 300mg’s was more daily and perfect. But someone on the max suboxone will not be satisfied right away on sublocade. You’re not suppose to be on 24mg really. The highest is 12mg. I would suggest if you are on heroine or a high dosage of some opiate do not go to sublocade first. Get suboxone first BC your doctor can adjust. Jumping right to permanent help is scary for some addicts especially if it’s not sufficient to what you usually take. But if you take 12mg’s or less, sublocade 300mg is perfect, then you work your way down. Lastly, Sublocade may take a few months to approve on Fidelis.",Kay

I would have very limited success with Suboxone. I would take it, when I had to, but generally I would get them and sell them. I also would wake up everyday consumed with getting money/getting high. So even with good intentions of taking Suboxone, there would be days that my addict thinking would take over before I had the chance to take the Suboxone and I would be high again. Sublocade removed the guess work for me. I wake up EVERYDAY feeling great and with NO DESIRE to get high. I am waking up feeling free for the first time in over 15 years.

I feel better then I did when taking strips, so it is worth it, because the strips had started to make me sick for 30-45 minutes after I took them.  They worked I would feel ok then for about 2 hours then felt like I needed another strip.  This led to over use just trying to stay comfortable.

After that first 2 weeks I started feeling normal, about to get my second injection soon and I'm looking forward to the future and excited about both not having the option to screw this up by selling my script and the incredibly long life that seems to allow many people to stop without serious withdrawal symptoms.

It bought me time and allowed me to change my behaviors and thinking. I had to discontinue it after 3 months of shots due to a mandated drug program. I continued to test pos for Bupe for 6 months. After 2 months of negative tests, I can tell you it was a fairly painless kick.  Cravings returned about 3 or 4 months after my last shot but improved and are gone now.  Bad insomnia but I didn’t feel tired during the day. I also had some mild to mod restless legs. Gabapentin helped me get through that. The shot self tapers very slowly so seems to be a great way to transition off Suboxone as well. I am now on Naltrexone and opiate free.

However occasionally I would take an extra or even TWO extra! I knew that it didn’t even do anything or get me high but I did it anyway. When I heard of Sublocade I thought to myself that this was my answer to finally not be dependent on the pills! The first couple of days I went through withdrawal but I believe it was in my head. Then a few months in (maybe 5) my friend asked me wouldn’t you be able to just stop getting it and it would slowly take you down and I was like uhhhh idk? Lol but I couldn’t  stop wondering. One month I decided to stop getting it and I could always go back if need be. That was in October or November of last year and knock on wood I’m still good...absolutely no withdrawal.

The high lasted a couple of days but now on my third day, I am starting to feel withdrawal symptoms. I woke up feeling like I am use to feeling this morning. It’s not extreme, just fatigued throughout the day. May need to supplement a few mg per day.

Right now, I am withdrawing but it's nothing too bad- Tight skin, slightly dilated pupils, runny nose, low energy. May be due to the tabs. What I can say now is this medicine puts you right at that fine line of withdrawal and feeling good enough to work. I may as well hop off all together and let this thing self taper. It motivates me to close the addiction chapter. It's not a bad medication, if you're motivated to get off.

This is the same medicine as Suboxone so there’s no way someone on 8mg and someone on 24mg are going to be ok on the same dose. Doctors will tell you it’ll be fine and that they don’t know howMuch it really released every month but after looking into it this thing releases 2 mg a day and that reduces to one and then half of a mg which is why most people go through withdrawals for a week or two after changing from stripe to the shot. I personally did. My doctor said almost everyone has a week of WD. This is only for people on a low dose or who want to get off of it so badly that they don’t mind feeling sick.

It's not there anymore.I requested a blood draw, to make sure there's actually Bupenorphine in my system. There is. It seems that I felt my best right after the 3rd injection.

It stings pretty bad, could feel the medicine clogging up when it hit my body fluid but it’s a good trade off for 30 Days and so far it’s mainly just weird not taking anything Is the biggest part for me.  It feels a lot cleaner due to route of administration. Was on 12 mg suboxone/day and don’t really have the ups & downs and headaches, etc. from taking too much buprenorphine, but it does feel a lot cleaner. I felt I was almost in bondage having to take my suboxone every morning, looking forward to it, having to take more meds, etc. so it feels better not having to feel like I’m in bondage to my medicine.

83,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 28, 2019",79,"So I was addicted to opiates for 4 years taking them orally and crushing and snorting them thats when I knew I needed help. I was losing everything and spending way to much money, I was basically working to get high. So I originally started with 8mg suboxone 2 times a day, then 21mg once a day for six months then was offered the sublocade shot. Initially I was sceptical but ended up doing it and am glad I did. It did burn upon injection and I was a little nausea for a couple days but then fine. So I never went back for second dose and let me tell u why this worked for me but you have to really want to not be dependent on another medication. My theory was its slowly released into your bloodstream so it will slowly leave it as well. Yes I did go thru a little withdrawal with the hot cold and sweating for like 2 days but it definitely was nothing like withdrawal from the actual opiate itself. I am currently still clean and sober and loving my family and life itself",Cee

After the initial pinch of the needle a burn is a great way to describe it. I am not good with pain but this is VERY MANAGEABLE. The injection lasted 5 seconds at the most and was not bad.

I did not take any strips on those days. Halfway through the 3rd day I started to feel withdrawals ( WDs) and I took one of my remaining strips to ease those feelings. After running out of the strips and depending only on this depot, I am experiencing WDs.

This shot is amazing and is doing everything he said it would do for me! And it’s painless! He gives a little shot of lidocaine before he injects the sublocade and when the shot of sublacade is going in you don’t feel a thing I’m serious!! About an hour later I could feel the medicine working it’s that fast. And the bump is not very noticeable but you can feel  it’s there.

So that’s 32 hours without suboxone and getting the shot 2 hours ago with no withdrawal so far, I think I’m good to go. I was told some people experience withdrawal at the beginning of getting this shot, but I think that only happens to those that switch from a very high dose of suboxone (above 12 mg) without tapering down some first. I’m no doctor, but have plenty of experience with addiction. My suggestion would be to make sure your on a regular dose of 8 mg per day of suboxone before getting the shot. If you do, and attend NA meetings regularly, this medicine is really a life saver. Don’t depend on the medicine alone, get involved in your local NA!!",Dave

No more fears of having enough meds or filling prescriptions & etc. Regarding the injection - it’s no fun, but also far from the worst thing I’ve ever felt. It feels like a typical shot with the liquid having a warming effect upon entry. Ironically & contrary to what I’ve read here from some, the only withdrawal I ever felt on Sublocade starts if I delay my injection past 30 days.

Transitioning from the suboxum to the sublicade was mildly uncomfortable for about five to seven days (mainly noticeable loss of energy and looser bowel movements, nothing unbearable....essentially went from 12 mg to the equivalent of 8 mg with the 100mg injectable sublacade.)    I would recommend this to anyone who is serious about getting off the suboxum.",DrugfreedrugE

I received my first Sublocade shot exactly 1 week ago today. Some days, even hours, are better than others but for the most part I feel pretty good! The biggest perk of the shot is not having to remember to take Suboxone everywhere I go. Good luck everyone!!",KickMick
121,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2018",14,"I had my first Sublocade shot this morning at 9am. I feel nothing. It stung, about like a black fly bite. It went away almost immediately.  I feel nothing at all. I worry. The small buzz I got from subs kept me going- not craving and using illicit opioids. My doc put me on the Subclocade due to mismanagement of dose. I wish I could just take the strips as prescribed. I'll keep posting. As of day one, I feel nothing at all. Just tired.",Meh
122,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 1, 2018",14,"Scared, after reading comments of sublocade, which I had the shot today. I really hope I don't have withdrawals. But I'm use to only taking 12 mg a day. Been on suboxone 1 year, before that methadone. It seems most people are honest but I'd like to know for the people who haven't had issue with sublocade are you pot smokers or taking any other meds that might be helping you deal with the switch? Cause I don't and I want to be able to balance the reviews out. Thanks",Appy
123,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,3.0,,"July 11, 2018",12,"I got my first Sublocade injection about three weeks ago. The injection was pretty painful, but the pain only lasted for about 15 minutes. I felt great the first several days, but I started feeling like I was going through withdrawals on day 4- no energy, headache, nausea, stomach cramps, and hot flashes. My doctor called in some strips so I could take one a day, and that has helped a little. However, I still feel like I need to take two 8 mg strips a day to feel normal. I was taking 24 mg per day for the past 6 months before getting the shot. After thinking about it a lot, I have decided not to get the second injection. I was doing great on 24 mg a day, so I’m going to go back to suboxone. I don’t want to spend another month feeling like crap. Hopefully the shot will work for others, but it wasn’t for me. It seems to work well for those who have been on a low dose of suboxone (8 mg or less per day).",Liz
124,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 8, 2018",10,"The biggest issue is that it only comes in two sizes 300 mg and 100 mg. Kinda hard to taper off from such a high dose. I feel like they would like you to stay on for the rest of your life and continue to pay the crazy high cost of Sublocade (approximately $1500 a month). I was able to qualify for the assistance and get the first two months at only five dollars, but the third month will be full price at which time I will likely be going back to Suboxone because I cannot afford the Sublocade.",drewglas44
125,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 7, 2018",11,"I have been on sublocade for about a month now, next injection is scheduled 3 days out. I struggled with using bupe IV style. The only con I have had is that the actual injection stung unbelievably. I was told that I was the 11 person in the nation to receive  this shot so I was really nervous. I just hope the mass goes away on its own so I am not 40 with numerous lumps on my belly...",Bryan with a y
126,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 2, 2018",5,I'm thinking of getting  the sublocade shot. The Dr is pushing for it a little too hard too. That concerns me. He told me that it stays in system for months when I said about worried if I missed next shot. That it gradually decreases but has been found 4-5 after first dose. I suffer from  a lot of headaches and I'm in school and am worried I will get shot and will have a headache. I can't get rid of  other negative symptom I have been on Suboxone pills since February,Angie
127,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,8.0,,"June 30, 2018",14,"So I got the  Sublocade shot three days ago, and the actual injection was so much more painful than I could have imagined.  It stung so bad for a good half hour after getting the shot.  I feel fine as far as the dosing goes and it's relaxing not having to remember to bring my suboxone with me to work every day.  I also would run out too early and have to deal with taking half my prescription dose the last two weeks of the month.  So far so good, I'll get it again next month despite the pain.  There is a lump at the injection site as well that as bruised and is sore to the touch.  Overall I think the benefit of peace of mind out way the pain",Caitlin
128,Sublocade,Opiate Dependence - Maintenance,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 24, 2018",17,I just received my first sublocade shot on Tuesday at 12:40 I had been on suboxone for 4 years and would a lot of times run out of my prescription early because I would always think one more to feel better just one more of course the only thing it might of done is give me energy for a little while but since receiving the shot I have to admit I'm not too impressed. Of course at this time my head could still be messing with me because I am having issues with the part of taking something everyday but I'm very very tired with no energy so I feel like rubbish and I'm still having some hot flashes I'm hoping it will get better and it will work because I want this to work but as of now I'd say the suboxone strips are a lot better but I will keep posting updates because I looked and looked for reviews before switching and couldn't find any so I'd like to help people by my story,Kassy Brooke
