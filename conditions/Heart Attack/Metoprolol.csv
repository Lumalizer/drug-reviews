0,Metoprolol,Heart Attack,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 21, 2022",1,"Metoprolol Tartrate (metoprolol):I was started on Metoprolol Tartrate for Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia and Long QT syndrome. At first I was on 25 once a day. That did nothing. Increased to 25mg twice a day. Still did nothing. Was increased to 100MG twice a day and it brought my heart rate down but not a lot and was still having a lot of symptoms. My usual resting without the medication is 130bpm and when I exercise it gets as high as 220 bpm. I get palpitations, SOB, fainting and etc. My most recent cardiac monitoring indicated needing to increase my dose so I was increased to 150 MG twice a day. My resting rate is on average 86 bpm now and they don't want to increase the metoprolol anymore so they're adding Ivabradine to the metoprolol. Its a good med and it has lowered my heart rate and lowered symptoms just not enough for me to be comfortable.",Its alright

I stop this medicine for 1 full day & I was energetic & very happy but Dr told me that I have to take a full year, uggghhhh, grrrrr!!!!!!",SUNSHINE
2,Metoprolol,Heart Attack,6.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 13, 2020",12,"Metoprolol Tartrate (metoprolol):Greetings:, I have been on metoprolol tartrate for years now for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG),  and I love it, they have ""tried"" me on ""Others"", But Besides That ""LOW"" Feeling, it's O.K., I just think they need to tailor, and (or) tweak my dose 50MG's X 2 A day,  But besides that I'm sold!",Reverend
3,Metoprolol,Heart Attack,,,"December 31, 2019",29,"HA with one stent in LAD and was prescribed Metoprolol and Brilinta.  A week later the side effects all kicked in: shooting chest pains, racing heart, chest/arms/legs tingling, jitteriness and anxiety.  I felt like I was having another HA so spent the weekend in the ER where they didn't find anything wrong. My GP prescribed anxiety meds which provided some helped a bit.  After a month of complaining to my cardiologist, they finally took me off of metoprolol and the anxiety, jitters and racing heart rate went away.I was still getting chest pains, shortness of breath, and was feeling nauseous.  Another month and I convinced my Dr to switch from Brilinta to Effient and the remaining side effects went away.I'm finally starting to feel normal.  Not all Drs are open to modifying patients meds which can be a real issue if you are experiencing negative side effects so please advocate for yourself.",Too young for all this...
4,Metoprolol,Heart Attack,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 11, 2019",11,"I've been taking 50MG daily (25MG twice daily) since my heart attack and quadruple bypass in March 2018.  The only side effect that I've seen is that my voice gets hoarse very easily.  My Dr says it isn't the Metoprolol, but from my research (googling), it seems that it can be a side-effect.  and I don't think it's the lisinopril, lipitor, nor plavix.",Eugene
5,Metoprolol,Heart Attack,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 19, 2019",72,Metoprolol Tartrate (metoprolol):I was put on metoprolol in 2010 25mg twice a day. I have just slowly tapered myself off. I wanna tell you I haven't felt this good in  9 years. I wished I had never taken it seriously,Ken
6,Metoprolol,Heart Attack,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 13, 2017",36,"Metoprolol Tartrate (metoprolol):Had a quintuple bypass surgery in August 2015 following a massive heart attack in May of 2015, during which I ""died"" for three minutes immediately after arriving at the ER. I had suffered severe chest pain for two hours before going to the ER, which was stupid of me.I have been on Metoprolol Tartrate for 2.5 years now. 25 mg. twice daily. It seems to work fine, as my blood pressure is consistently around 116 over 64, and my heart rate is 54 BPM at last check-up two months ago. Before my heart attack, it was around 150 over 80, so a vast improvement there. I also am on a low dose (10 mg. daily) of Lisinopril, so that may help as well.The only side effect I am experiencing is severe exhaustion following a 10-hour shift at work. Age 57.",Giles Habibula

8,Metoprolol,Heart Attack,,,"September 23, 2015",17,"I previously posted over a year ago on this subject. After nine months of taking 50mg/day, my cardiologist dropped me down to 25mg, once per day of Metoprolol Succinate. I'd like to be med-free, but I don't know if it is possible at this point. I'm walking/jogging 15-18 miles per week, and in better shape now than I've ever been. I feel great most of the time, but still get extremely tired. I don't know if that's the drug, or just natural aging. :)",Rob_B62

10,Metoprolol,Heart Attack,9.0,,"July 30, 2015",22,"Began 6 months after attack a very low dose (1/2 per day of smallest dosage pill)Began sleeping 12 to 16 hours each day. Also, seemed not to care about anything- said inappropriate comments, pulled out into traffic recklessly, and damaged gardening equipment. Nothing seriously bad happened but I had to learn to concentrate differently. After three years I had a number of concerns and stopped taking this med- sexual desire increased as did erections, urine stream strong, fewer trips to the bathroom, and I care about the future again. With all that said - I think Metoprolol helped me to recover and I began taking it again, but I am going to talk to my doctor about discontinuing it.",BenB
11,Metoprolol,Heart Attack,6.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 26, 2014",73,"Metoprolol Tartrate (metoprolol):I've been taking metoprolol for about 12 years now, 1 in the morning and 1 at night for the first 7 years and then dropped it to 1 morning and half at night and for the last 2 years. I've been on half morning and half at night, my heart rate was too low but apart from that I have had no other problems.",borrisbb
12,Metoprolol,Heart Attack,8.0,,"July 28, 2014",140,"Metoprolol Tartrate (metoprolol):I'm a 52 YO male in fairly good shape. I started taking Metoprolol, 50mg twice a day after suffering a cardiac arrest earlier this year, in April. It has been very effective in controlling my blood pressure and keeping my heart rate low. The side effects are becoming unbearable now though. I'm tired, and have a lot of trouble focusing on my work during the day, have a lot of restless nights of tossing and turning, and have now developed a rash under my arms. I think it also contributes to erectile dysfunction. I spoke to my cardiologist about all this today, and he's cutting my dose in half. I'm hoping some of these side effects will diminish when I cut down to 25mg twice a day.",Rob_B62
13,Metoprolol,Heart Attack,5.0,,"May 23, 2011",17,"I take metoprolol tartrate not metoprolol with hydrochlorthiazide, however I have noticed a marked frequency of urination and polyuria after starting this medication.  My doctor suspected a urinary tract infection (although I am not experiencing dysuria, fever, chills or having any other typical UTI symptoms).  Urinalysis was negative, prostate exam was negative, cystoscopy was negative.The medicine is doing what it is supposed to be doing, but having to urinate every two hours around the clock is certainly interfering with my sleep.  I did find a reference on Drugs.com that said increased urination was a rarely encountered side effect of this drug, but my doctors insist it doesn't have that side effect and I have spent a fortune ruling out other conditions.",Anonymous
14,Metoprolol,Heart Attack,5.0,,"February 27, 2011",80,"Metoprolol Succinate ER (metoprolol):Make sure you review your dosage with the doctor.  As the others stated, it will make you tired and lethargic.  It also has had an effect on my ability to have a discussion without forgetting a word or two. My doctor gave me a dosage of 100mg/2x daily.  I wound up back in the hospital due to my heart rate being a low 32 beats per minute.  The hospital treated it as a failure with the original stent and went back in to check the previous operation.  That was over a year ago.  We tweaked the prescription down to 50 mg once a day, but I never got out of the lethargic state.",Anonymous
15,Metoprolol,Heart Attack,1.0,,"April 10, 2009",24,"Initially, I was put on this for regulation of the heart.  Have since found out that my doctor didn't want me to take anymore because I have severe low pressure.",Anonymous
