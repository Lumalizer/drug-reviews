0,Warfarin,Heart Attack,7,,"January 19, 2020",1,"my late wife had been on warfarin for a number of years. What looked like bruises showed up on the back of both legs below the knees. The ""bruises"" eventually became open sores and would not heal -calciflaxis. The sores opened up around mid April 2019 and she passed away late August 2019. The wounds DR. that was treating the open wounds did tell my wife that ""you may die from this type of problem as the blood vessels are calcifying"". The Dr. she saw for possible kidney problems immediately placed her on a different blood thinner as he said ""I see cases of this only in patients that are on dialysis"".",bobbie
1,Warfarin,Heart Attack,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 14, 2017",7,"This was recommended to my brother in law last year and he almost died from it, severe and I mean severe diarrhea, falling all over the place, it was terrible then my sister told the clinic she would not let him take any more and from that day he just improved back to his normal self, in December last year 2016, my sister had a mild heart attack and she is now on Warfarin, she has exactly the same symptoms though not as bad, I have urged her to take it up with her own GP which she will do in three days time, what I don't understand is every ""specialist"" says that you should avoid Aspirin when taking Warfarin so why do they prescribe them together? STRANGE",chipeto
2,Warfarin,Heart Attack,7,,"March 5, 2015",8,"Dad has been on warfarin/Coumadin for over 10 years. He started taking it after he had a triple bypass. He has since had two stents, one at a time. He is 83 years old, and has been getting along great. He recently got sick, went to hospital. All of his symptoms could have been side affects from the warfarin. The doctors would not put down a reason for his getting ill. I would give warfarin a good rating. By the way, if you start interacting with cartoon characters on TV, or can watch a movie, just by closing your eyes, don't be alarmed. You're not alone. Just try to have fun with it. That's what dad does.",rellim htennek
