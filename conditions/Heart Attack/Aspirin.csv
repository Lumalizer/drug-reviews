2,Aspirin,Heart Attack,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 24, 2013",37,My family has a history of heart attack so I always carry aspirin with me just in case.  I found a wristband on the market that stores 2 aspirin in it.  It is a great and convenient method of carrying aspirin around so I don't need a bulky bottle of it in my pocket.  It is called the Beatfirst Aspirin Wristband for anyone else with the same problem.,Mike2K
