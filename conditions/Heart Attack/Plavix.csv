0,Plavix,Heart Attack,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 7, 2021",2,"Just spent 5 days in hospital w/my father who passed out at home from anemia caused by internal bleeding. Neuro, oncology, gastro docs all urged that he stop Plavix immediately.  We had to wait 5 days for an endo/colonoscopy to clear his body of Plavix while they pumped him with Iron and blood transfusions. If you are on Plavix or a loved one is PLEASE ask your doctors about risk/benefits and internal bleeding risks - regularly.  Just because it helped for a specific problem at some point does NOT mean it should be a blanket prescription for 10+ years.  Ask.  Be annoying. Save your life or your parent’s life.  My father still needs more tests but will probably be on iron therapy for the remainder of his life as the damage is now irreversible.",J.M.B.
1,Plavix,Heart Attack,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 20, 2020",5,I was put on Plavix after a heart attack and had no bad side effects at all. However I did have 2 more heart attacks while taking plavix and am now on warfarin. My doctor took part in a drug genetic test which showed plavix has zero effect on meand sadly there are others that this drug just doesn't work for so get tested and make sure it is safe for you. If plavix works for you its a safe drug,Cae
2,Plavix,Heart Attack,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 20, 2019",22,"Had a heart attack and angioplasty in 1992. I’ve been on aspirin  since then and combined with Plavix in 1997.  The artery they opened has long since totally closed. Colateral blood vessels give me good flow around 100 percent occlusion.  I’m actually doing fantastic physically. Biking, hiking and before that basketball. Every doctor, and I’ve seen a few over the years, said they will never take me off either Plavix or aspirin.",Dante G.

Wife says I got thick blood and a thick head!!! No side effects, no interactions with my other 7 meds. I had plavix stents and told would have to take this rest of my life.

12,Plavix,Heart Attack,10.0,,"September 13, 2011",151,"I have been taking PLAVIX from the day it came on the market because of my unique clotting problem. My heart doctor has me on both PLAVIX and 325 Mg of aspirin once daily. When I developed atrial fibrillation, they put me on warfarin also. Then I started having bleeding problems. They took me off the warfarin and I was fine on the PLAVIX and aspirin, no clot problems encountered.",Timeless

I have been taking Plavix for the last month with no problems.  The doctors tell me I will be on Plavix for the rest of my life.  At this point in my life (64) I have a cast iron stomach.  Because of the aspirin I have been taking for years (perhaps the reason I didn't have a heart attack) I bruise easily and bleed profusely.  Different bodies, different results.  I'll try to check back in a year and update my experience.",FOOTGOO
15,Plavix,Heart Attack,10.0,,"April 4, 2011",135,"I was a heavy smoker and ate all the 'bad' foods and then, one year ago this month (April 2011) I had a heart attack. Now, one stent later, and after one year of Plavix, I have had no recurrence. Of course, I also quit smoking (hard to do but I figured my life was worth it), changed my diet (also a hard change to make), and started exercising. I guess I will be on Plavix for the rest of my natural but, thanks to the Plavix, that natural may just be a lot longer than I had hoped for last year. As for side effects. I feel the cold a little more due to the blood thinning properties of Plavix but I don't think I bruise any easier than I used to, and I am not a 'bleeder' so all in all it's good.",Anonymous

Took Plavix for 8 months then discontinued on doctor orders. 8 months later I suffered stent thrombosis and the 2 doctors I saw in the hospital seemed surprised I had discontinued Plavix. Another stent was inserted and I have been on Plavix since. I jog or bike at least an hour a day, usually more. My GERD has gotten worse lately and I just switched from Plavix to Effient along with proton pump inhibitors in morning and evening.",Anonymous

20,Plavix,Heart Attack,8.0,,"April 30, 2010",150,"I have severe bruising on my arms from very thin skin. I have debated for a long time about taking Plavix. I started taking it 9 years ago when I had a very mild heart attack and a stent in a 90% blocked artery. There was another artery that was 60% blocked which they told me should be watched. 6 months ago , I had a heart catheter and they said the blockage was gone, and they didn't know why.  My Doctor said that I should continue taking Plavix, and that stopping probably wouldn't help the bruising and thin skin.  So that is what I will do.",librasue

24,Plavix,Heart Attack,8.0,,"October 5, 2009",130,"I've been using Plavix for a couple years now since I had 2 angioplasties.It work just fine.

26,Plavix,Heart Attack,7.0,,"June 24, 2009",152,"I guess it is working great to relieve the possibility of clots, for I have no sign of a clot returning. However, I am covered in bruises and my stomach is knots more, I feel bloated and uncomfortable. I am unable to drink even a small amount of coffee in the morning, even a few hours after having taken the dose.
