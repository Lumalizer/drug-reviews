1,Ramipril,Heart Attack,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 8, 2017",12,"I was prescribed Ramipril (5mg/daily) and 4 other medications (Aspirin, Effient, Atorvastatin, and Coreg)  after a heart attack 6 years ago.  The only side effect I've had is constipation.  I don't take the Coreg or Effient anymore, but the constipation has continued, but is diminished.  So I can't say for sure which medication is causing the issue.I take 1 small capsule of Ducosate Sodium daily to counteract this side effect (the full dose of 3 capsules seems to be too much for .  This seems to do the trick for me.I have always had slightly low blood pressure. The Ramipr lowers it a bit more (unfortunately).

2,Ramipril,Heart Attack,9.0,,"February 1, 2013",67,"Altace (ramipril):9th anniversary of 5x bypass.  Blood pressure was never high.   Altace, began with 5mg in the morning, was feeling faint every time I stood up all day.  Changed to 5mg before bed, faint if I got up to pee.  Changed to 2.5 mg in the evening, OK till last night (9 years) difference was had the flu or something similar, had a high fever, night sweats, diarrhea, got up to go to the bathroom and found myself on the bedroom floor, no damage, fell into the dirty clothes basket, so the warning about excessive sweat or any loss of fluids, is a good one.",Sam of Newburyport
