0,Haloperidol,Aggressive Behavior,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 18, 2020",4,"I’m 22 and in July I went to the hospital for extreme destructive and aggressive behavior due to my bipolar and schizophrenia. I stayed in the mental health unit for 8 days and before I left they injected me with haldol which I started feeling very calm which is perfectly fine for me because Ativan makes me calm and I thought haldol was the same. But I had the WORST month of my life! I was insanely sleepy I slept up to 9 times a day, was very anxious, very restless, I had extreme slurred speech where people couldn’t make out what I was saying, I was slobbering and drooling then one night I had a panic attack so bad that I was hyperventilating, sweating, screaming, vomiting, hitting my head, so I went to the hospital again and they gave me a shot of Benadryl and Ativan and the side effects of haldol slowly went away and when I got discharged in the morning I felt like me again. I'm on Zyprexa, Zoloft and Depakote now",Cora Wilson

2,Haloperidol,Aggressive Behavior,1,,"July 19, 2020",6,"I was given this haloperidol with an injection of Ativan a few days ago for aggressive behavior due to my bipolar. I was so freaking angry and annoyed and was also crying my eyes out and throwing things so at the crappy hospital I was at they had several nurses screaming at me even though I was hysterical. They strapped me to the bed and this dude said he’s going to inject me with HALDOL and Ativan. And I freaked out and told him that I demanded only Ativan and he said all patients who are hysterical have to take haldol it doesn't matter if your are allergic or not"" so I got injected with both haldol and Ativan. In 5 minutes I started feeling unusually sleepy and my legs were insanely restless at the same time. I slept for 15 hours that night and the feeling in my legs were so extreme that I wanted to scream and launch out of my own body but I massaged my legs with lotion to get rid of the feeling. The feeling wore off 17 hours later.",Camilla

4,Haloperidol,Aggressive Behavior,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 11, 2017",13,"I was prescribed haldol for aggression  (agitation) when I was hospitalized for bipolar disorder. The psychiatrist I had had a very abrasive personality and prescribed it after I hauled off on staff without telling me anything about it, not even the name. I became extremely shaky, could not hold my head up, was very drowsy and just couldn't function. I literally screamed at my doctor to take me off of it when he gave me something to counteract the shakiness. I was fine then. When I was discharged he was going to give me straight haldol, but I argued with him  (and won).",Glad it's over
