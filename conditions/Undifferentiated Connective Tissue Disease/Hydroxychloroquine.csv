0,Hydroxychloroquine,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,,,"December 28, 2021",0,"I have been diagnosed with Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease (UCTD) since July 2021 and was put on hydroxychloroquine. I don’t have the regular symptoms such as joint pain, rash, swelling around the joints and sleeping a lot so I’m not sure if my condition is UCTD . Instead I am experiencing insomnia, burning sensation pain mainly from my lower back to my thighs, hot flushes, chills, rapid weight loss and weakness in my body for part of each  day. For the first 2 months of taking the medication pain was all over my body, dizzy, loss of appetite so I guess it helps slightly with the pain since it not so bad now and the earlier side effects are gone. It is difficult to rate it because I am feeling just a little better but I don’t know if it contributes to the drastic weight loss and the GI issues am experiencing .Dosage — 1st Month 1 tablet every other day thereafter a tablet daily—- 200 mg",VB Jamaica
1,Hydroxychloroquine,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 27, 2021",0,I can definitely tell that this med calmed my symptoms and actually gave me about a two month break between flares.  Highly recommend,OEE
2,Hydroxychloroquine,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 27, 2020",12,"It took several doctors and approximately 3 years before I was properly diagnosed with UCTD (Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease). My rheumatologist prescribed 200mg of HCQ (hydroxychloroquine) twice a day I’ve been taking it religiously since the middle of July 2020. It took exactly 10 weeks to the day to kick in, but after that I felt much better and almost normal again. I began running again starting at 3-5 km a run and got up to 8.5 km. Then, the day after that 8.5 km run, I started to feel worse. It’s been a week now and I still feel horrible. Muscle weakness, slight nausea, muscles aches. Hopefully, this is simply a flare up and will go away again. The only side-effect I have from HCQ is the occasional itching on my arms and legs. It happens about every 3 or four days. That is sometimes unbearable, but disappears in 20 minutes. I will continue taking HCQ and see where the journey takes me. I get my eyes checked regularly due to the HCQ therapy.",Pete
3,Hydroxychloroquine,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,5.0,,"November 21, 2020",8,"Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine):George: just read your review and had to reply. Hope u read this. I’m the same age; similar exp w/ symptom prog. over a 10 year span. But with AS, I got a few diff opinions (also HLA-B27- but very high pos ANA). My rheum still wanted imaging of my Sacroiliac Joints. 10 yrs of drs never suggested it. It’s diff than just your spine/pelvis. If you haven’t had it specifically, look for a rheum who works with a radiology center. Bc I’ve had an MRI to check prog.; report came back clean. Luckily had a rheum who said no way, got the disc & said it was the worst MRI ever. If it had been first & trusted report, I would have never known I had damage. Didn’t respond well to anti-TNF (for AS). 3 yrs ago was dx’d  w/ UCTD/EDS Hypermobility Type. If you haven’t had a rheum check you for that, find a new one. Changed my life. No cure, but finally have right treatment team. I really hope you read this and it helps. If you have any questions let me know I would love to help.",EB

My rheumatologist trialed me on hydroxycholoroquine. I didn't have high hopes, as I generally react badly to pretty much all medications. He said it would take at least three months to see if it worked for me. But lo and behold!!! I noticed a difference only a couple weeks in. Now I'm on 200mg 2x/day, and have been taking it for nine months. It's a total game changer.I am getting my retinas checked by a specialist once a year.",greenjelloland
6,Hydroxychloroquine,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,10.0,,"September 23, 2020",8,"This medication hydroxychloroquine has been an absolute lifesaver for me! I was diagnosed with Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease 10 years ago. I've been taking Plaquenil for 8 years. I take 400 mg 5 days per week. It took about 4 months to build up enough in my system to start working. By the time I had been on Plaquenil for a year, I felt back to normal. This is a drug that takes time to work -- be patient and don't give up too early. I get a full eye exam annually and also do a visual field test (peripheral vision) every 6 months.I went off of Plaquenil for about 6 months in 2018 and all of my symptoms came back with a vengeance! I will NEVER stop this medication again unless my doctor advises me to for a serious medical reason. Fortunately I have no side effects from it. I have the occasional bad day where I feel achy, tired, and unwell, but most of the time I feel normal and fine with no pain or other debilitating symptoms.",Lifeline

I started in my mid 20s, and I have noticed a significant difference in my overall general well being. I still get flares and I still suffer pain but it doesn't leave me in bed for weeks, I'm not having month long flare ups, they last a day maybe which is usually triggered by excessive stress or a long hard strenuous day on my body. I am thankful that this medication was prescribed to me and that I pushed through the hardest part of the first few months and gave it a good chance.  At first my body was a little all over the place but now I have no real side effects that I know of, and I'm much better for taking it.",Saz

9,Hydroxychloroquine,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,1.0,,"January 11, 2020",36,"Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine):Horrible drug for me. I was on it for about three days when I noticed a spotty rash everywhere on my face. On day six I was out and about when I started sweating, lost hearing, got very nauseous and then collapsed. I started convulsing on the ground. Fortunately this happened right outside of an allergy clinic and they were trained in first aid and had supplies. I had a cannula for a saline drip put in right there on the hallway floor, an oxygen mask put on my face, and they tried to intubate so that I could breathe. I had very low blood pressure and heart rate when the paramedics arrived. There was so little blood pumping that their finger heart rate monitor couldn't pick it up and they had to do it manually! On the way to the ER my glucose levels were VERY low and heart rhythms wonky. After hours in the ER they determined it was an allergic reaction/adverse effects from Plaquenil.

13,Hydroxychloroquine,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,1.0,,"September 14, 2019",7,"I was diagnosed with  Undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD)  in December 2018 and put on hydroxychloroquine. Within a couple of weeks I started getting a rash, it quickly spread down my body and within a few days it started to blister and slough off. I went to a local ER, they immediately transferred me to a burn unit where I was diagnosed with Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). A biopsy confirmed that it was the result of an allergic reaction to the hydroxychloroquine. When all was said and done, the skin on over 90% of my body had blistered up and sloughed off. I was put on 60mg a day of prednisone to help my skin heal. 8 months later, my skin is healed but I'm still dealing with the effects of Cushings Syndrome from being on a heavy dosage of prednisone for so long. My new rheumatologist said that hydroxychloroquine wouldn't likely have been effective in relieving joint pain as severe as mine anyway; he said he would have never prescribed it to me in the first place.",Larry
14,Hydroxychloroquine,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,1.0,,"July 31, 2019",3,My 12 year old daughter took this hydroxychloroquine FIRST time in her birthday for aches and pains in joints.  I found her laying across my bed. I tried to get her to the other room and she could not even walk. She had no muscle control at all. She had belly pain and no appetite. The muscle weakness is coming in waves. She’ll be ok and then next thing I know laid out on the couch and can’t move. I will not be giving her this med again.,Mamaof6
15,Hydroxychloroquine,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,1.0,,"June 1, 2019",9,"I was diagnosed with UCTD and put on 300 mg/day of hydroxychloroquine while simultaneously being weaned off prednisone. 17 days after starting it, I noticed a rash the size of a quarter on my shoulder. Within a week, the rash was covering almost my entire upper torso and starting to blister and slough off. I was admitted to the burn unit at the local hospital where I stayed for a week with Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis; I lost over 90% of the skin on my body. To treat the condition, my daily intake of prednisone was boosted to 60 mg/day which eventually gave me Cushing Syndrome, which I'm still recovering from 5 months later. So if your rheumatologist prescribes it, just make sure you're aware of the serious potential side effects, because mine is not an isolated case...this drug is a known cause of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, and they are life threatening conditions.",Larry
16,Hydroxychloroquine,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 30, 2019",12,I took this medication ONE time for UCTD (undifferentiated connective tissue disorder) and the side effects are horrible.  Nauseous & no appetite for the whole day.  I fell asleep for 3 hours and I woke up with a terrible headache and the aching in my hands and body are worse.  Prior to this I started a gluten free diet with vegetables and fruits and herbal remedies and I was actually able to start working out in the gym.  I still have pain but not like I experienced on this medication.  By reading the experience of others on here I see how much they improved so I guess some ppl do well  on it and some don’t.,Jay

I have had some thinning  of my hair and can be nauseated in the morning if I don’t eat but these are minor side effects compared to the symptoms it is treating.

I’m down to one pill once a day and absolutely miserable. I’m easily fatigued, achy, and feel exhausted. Started going to bed earlier and earlier but not feeling rested. Don’t want to get out of bed.

19,Hydroxychloroquine,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease,10.0,,"October 6, 2018",20,"Hydroxychloroquine has been a miracle drug for me. I've been on it for 6 years. I first got sick in 2010. I struggled with strange, debilitating symptoms for 2 years before being put on Plaquenil by a rheumatologist. I had a high positive ANA (Antinuclear Antibody test) , positive Rheumatoid Factor, and low complement levels. My symptoms were Raynauds, extreme sensitivity to cold, all-over body PAIN (muscles, joints, skin, tendons, everything hurt), GERD, migraines with aura, heart palpitations, nausea and diarrhea, flu-like feelings, fatigue, dizziness and weakness, and tingling and numbness that would come and go. I was barely managing to function.I was put on Plaquenil finally when my rheumatologist looked at my nailfold capillaries--they were abnormal in a way that suggested connective tissue disease. Within 3-4 months I started to feel better. I got better and better over the next 6 months. By the time I'd been on Plaquenil for a year, I felt almost normal again with only the occasional bad day.",Toronto Mom

I must admit I’m a recovering alcoholic for almost 2 years. I can’t remember when I was first diagnosed and started this medication.

Now I am on plaquenil for life, and 100 % in remission. This drug has been absolutely amazing for me. I guess it just depends on individual body chemistry, but I love this drug so very, very much. Now, honestly, you have to give it 3-6 months to fully take effect, and it can cause GI upset and other side effects at first. You just have to tough it out and be strong-minded. Plaq is a game changer for many UCTD patients but you need to be tough and patient!! Don't skip doses.",LGFr

I really did not want to take any medication, and felt that improving my lifestyle/keeping warm was worth a try,  but my (new) rheumatologist pushed it and said he would discharge me if I didn't take it. All my other tests (lung function, heart scan, bloods) were fine. What a mistake. It did not help my Raynaud's, but did cause huge hives from my neck to my ankle.
