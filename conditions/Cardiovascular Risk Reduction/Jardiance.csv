0,Jardiance,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 19, 2022",0,Hmm! I started taking Jardiance in June 2017 and I have not felt the same again. These days I am experiencing pain in my bones and muscles especially the muscles in my feet. I can barely walk with the pain in my feet. I get numbness and burning sensation in my feet. I am stopping Jardiance today and use diet to control my blood sugar. What a medicine!,Bissy
1,Jardiance,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 27, 2020",19,"My doctor gave me a sample of this to help with weight loss.  I have plateaued after losing over 30 pounds on my own and he thought this would give me a little kickstart again.  I took one pill (10 mg) in the morning and by the afternoon, I felt nauseous and ended up vomiting twice in the next few hours. It was horrible and I felt awful all night.  I'm not going to take this med.  I should've trusted my instinct when I read all the horrible reviews and debated before starting.  I'll figure out another way to get past my plateau but that sample went into the trash.",KMW

4,Jardiance,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2019",50,"I started this medication in August 2019, this medicine works my  a1c went from 11 down to 7.7  with really no changes in anything I did. It was going smoothly for the first couple months, then late October I got a UTI and  took antibiotics, it went away about 3 days after the antibiotics it was back, so back on antibiotics I went for ten days got rid of it and guess what about a week later here it came again. The pain when I peed was so bad my urine was like acid it burned what it touched. I'm so tired of having these UTI they are horrible. So today I decided to go off this medication. I would recommended this medication if you don't have any of the side effects. But if you experience the side effects please stop taking it, it may do more damage than people know. I think sometimes the cure is worst than the disease.",Me
