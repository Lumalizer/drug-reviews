0,Repatha,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,1.0,,"October 27, 2021",3,"I only had a score of 36 on my calcium heart scan....really low, I was happy about it...but, the cardiologists office called me like I was going to have a heart attack immediately. Kept pushing me to take this Repatha. I was really hesitant to try it as I had tried a statin drug years ago and that was really hard on my body me - I literally collapsed on that drug. It was as if my muscles had melted off of my leg bones.  Well three months into Repatha, I'm having severe hip pain, and I'm stopping Repatha immediately.  I hope to God it goes away as it is an awful, nagging pain without causation.  I also experienced a frightening episode of shortness of breath for absolutely no reason.  I almost went to the ER because I just couldn't breathe.  It passed in a few minutes, but what is this drug?  Anyway, I would NOT recommend this...NO WAY.  It just isn't worth it in my opinion.",DON'T TAKE IT
1,Repatha,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,1.0,,"October 19, 2021",1,I have been taking the Repatha injections for 3 years. I had to have 5 bypasses two years ago. Just had a heart cath and now have 5 100% blockages. I don’t think it’s helping my arteries at all. Bad Cholesterol is 51 and my total cholesterol is 108. Very disappointing results!!!!,James
2,Repatha,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,2.0,,"October 12, 2021",3,"I’ve been taking Repatha on the advice of my doctor. Tried a few different statins , Lipitor , Crestor , and been having a difficult time with them . Maybe that’s what leads us to a drug that can be so harmful? Not to mention my cardiac history , I guess I have to feel that I would definitely give it my best try . I don’t know yet if it has worked wonders for my cholesterol because my blood work is not in yet , but I can only guess most likely it has lowered mine like the rest of yours. After 4 injections I’m noticing quite a few side effects . Finger & toe pain. Arm and shoulder pain with neck pain running up the back to my head. I have plates in the back of my neck which are being aggravated . Dizziness a feeling of extreme forgetfulness . Describing it to my husband ( fogginess)  . Lack of urination , dangerous for a heart patient & constipation . Extreme night sweats !Weight gain .",Nogueira

7,Repatha,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 29, 2021",52,"After an event of cardiomyopathy, I took  pill form of statins. Each one I tried gave me terrible leg pain. Cardiologist’s PA then prescribed Repatha.  I took one dose of 140 mg on a Sunday, and by Tuesday I had to be taken to the hospital via ambulance due to being completely immobile with back pain. It is now Friday; I’ve had a dye contrast MRI and there is nothing found to be wrong with my back. I went from being perfectly mobile to being disabled, possibly permanently. I am now on three blood pressure medications where I was previously on one, and heavy narcotics to control pain. Even with all of this, the pain is still not entirely controlled, and I can’t move without the help of two nurses to use the bathroom or walk. After some heavy research, my daughter discovered that Repatha can permanently damage the musculature within the body. I BEG of anyone prescribed Repatha to never use it.  It’s criminal that it was ever approved by the FDA. Please, Stay away from this medication!",Twey

Went years without any medication until my cardiologist recommended to try Repatha saying it has hardly any known side effects. After taking 5 shots I have to disagree and probably stop taking this miracle drug. It certainly works as after 2 months my LDL went down 50%. But after about 1.5 months in I started to have side effects: excessive sweating (head), chills, weak legs, pain and aching in feet, ankles, knees and groin. Dry and itchy sinuses. Change in vision. Mild back pain and overall fatigue, I stopped taking it for a month and about 3 weeks after the side effects were gone. After 4 weeks tried to take another shot and in 4-5 days all the goodies were back. Works great if you can tolerate it.",MI at 37

17,Repatha,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,2.0,,"April 29, 2020",58,"After 4th injection developed weakness in arm and leg, rushed to ER. While they were doing CT and MRI for stroke the weakness spread to all other large muscles. Then in about a week fatigue came. Also diarrhoea, muscle twitching, nausea, lightheadedness, pounding pulse, runny nose and general feeling of a very, very bad hangover. It's been two months and the symptoms wax and wane. A week of improvement alternate with symptom recurrence. All possible tests for electrolytes, antibodies, known systemic conditions, endocrine etc. are normal. I was stunned when started reading on forums that people experienced exactly the same presentation of the side effects. Progressive, after several unremarkable injections, waxing and waning side effects that linger for months after discontinuation. They are totally disabling and scary at their peak. It does lower LDL a lot, but with those side effects I am not sure it can prolong life. It is damaging something in the cells on the way.",Jack
18,Repatha,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 31, 2020",64,Repatha was prescribed to me by my cardiologist because I have statin intolerance (muscle pain). I started taking Repatha in November 2019. after 2 months my LDL went down significantly. My cardiologist and I were very please with the results but in January 2020 I started experiencing pain in my shoulders and upper arms. The source of pain cannot be determined after a lot of investigation. The pain as we speak is getting worse and wakes me up at night. I take pain relievers and muscle relaxant to get a temporary relief. I am planning to take coQ10 for a few weeks and see if there is any improvement. I have no choice but to continue with this medication since I had triple bypass surgery 2 years ago. I will keep the group posted if I notice any pain relief  after taking coQ10.,Victor

22,Repatha,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 12, 2019",21,"I took three doses of Repatha on a two week regimen as instructed.  Within several weeks I began having severe right side gastrointestinal issues.  My Liver enzymes shot up quickly.  The Doctor indicated that this was not from Repatha.  However, after 69 years I do not believe in coincidence.  I stopped the drug and, to date, the enzymes are SLOWLY declining.  However, I have severe pain.  14 blood tests, a MRI, two ultra sounds and a CT Scan in a five week period show a few cysts but nothing major.  The pain is so rough that I will have an Endoscopy next week.  While I am thrilled that the tests have looked good I remain quite concerned because of the constant pain.  There is no way to determine if Repatha is the culprit.  However, I will state again that this all started within days of starting this drug.Rcristal",Rcristal

I have experienced back pain and hip pain. Thought was the Vescepa and called heart doctor. Didn't think about Repatha. Was told to reduce dosage, but I quit completely. I still have same pain, but legs getting worse hurts to walk. Pain in hip bones and back still there too. Decided to read reviews on Repatha and I am having identical pain as other reviewers. I am not using it either and see if all this pain goes away.  I had bronchitis and some type of flu also now am wondering if this med was what caused that. Why would a heart doctor prescribe two drugs to lower cholesterol? Mine is high from genetics. My doctor said if I didn't get cholesterol down would be back with needing another stent, heart attack, or stroke. What helps one thing causes something else thats serious.  How long did it take after some of you quit taking for side effects to go away? Hope these drugs don't do permanent damage.",Linda Lou

The worst part is that when I reported this to my cardiologist  the reaction was gee we did not know that was a side effect. The same response came from the Cardiology department. Hard to fathom  that they didn't know about a side effect that is listed on the reaptha.com website in plain English.  Tells you something about how informed the Doctors are - and we rely on their knowledge. Funny just after my experience Repatha price dropped ...that pretty much tells the tale,JJ

The flu feeling got much worse and I started to get a general arthralgia. After the third injection I was in trouble with back ache, burning when urinating, diarrhoea, back pain, tenderness in all muscle groups and my heart was skipping beats. I felt absolutely dreadful, my consultant stopped repatha immediately. He declared cogently (urgently) that this reaction was not common. I do have a rare genetic muscle disorder which is subtle. He is just not confident to say that repatha had caused the problems, but did agree that it may be linked.I can only say that my experience with repatha was dreadful. Will update second time around.

45,Repatha,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 15, 2018",32,"Started Repatha just about this time last year. Couple of days after 1st injection developed diarrhea, always tired, runny nose and fit of sneezing. Numb spot on my left thigh from injection. Felt like I had the flu all the time. Skin problems and a few other things.  My cardiologist said I would adjust to repatha, I never did adjust. I quit repatha in April of 2018 its now 11/2018.  I still have the side effects I listed above.  I have to wonder if side effects are permanent.  The Mfg hasn't return any of my doctors phone calls.  Anyone thought about legal action?",eaglewynd
46,Repatha,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,1.0,,"November 12, 2018",24,I was one of the original people on the blind study. At the time I was a caretaker and I started getting terrible back pain but I attributed it to lifting my husband. The pain continued. After a year my husband passed and my back pain got worse and then the leg pain started. I went to many doctors and no one could find a problem. I even had cortisone shots which did not help. After researching all my medications I finally came to the conclusion that it might be repatha. I decided to stop it for a few months. It didn’t seem to stop but it did get a little better but not enough for me to stop it altogether. I decided to go back on. Two months later after four shots it is worse then ever. I can hardly walk. After reading some more I realized that I didn’t give it enough time. I am going off it again. Hopefully the pains will go away. I read that it could take up to a year to completely go away if at all. When I was on the drug the expense was covered by the study. I am still on it.,Paty

49,Repatha,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,,,"October 8, 2018",31,I can't take statin. My doctor prescribed Repatha to me and confirmed to me that it has no side effects. I took 3 injections.  I  started feeling muscle pain and back pain . I felt  very weak and fatigue.I check with my doctor and pharmacist.  They said that Repatha is causing these problems. I wish I  never took Repatha.I wish someone can tell me how long  I have to wait to feel better and get back to normal conditions. It has been 2 weeks since I took my 3 injection.I recommend that you don't take this drug. It's dangerous. I don't what to do now.,Victimx

Have been attempting to use the drug for over a year now, having suspended use a couple of times first due to a serious gastric event and then due to the flu.  Have now determined that it is the Repatha that is giving me flu symptoms even if I only inject once a month.  7 to 10 days after the injection I develop a severe sore throat followed by two weeks of sinus congestion and sometimes laryngitis.",Baker
