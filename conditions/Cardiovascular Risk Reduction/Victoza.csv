0,Victoza,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 25, 2021",6,My doctor just prescribed this for me. Today is my first day and very excited to see all the positive reviews. My sugar also a bit on the high side so hoping it helps with that as well. I just started at lowest dose. I didn't even feel the needle (hope it went in !! lol) I am hoping to lose 25 to 30 pounds. I have tried other prescription diet aids and did not like the side effects on most. I will update shortly to advise on any side effects and results! Good luck everyone.,JoAnneG56
