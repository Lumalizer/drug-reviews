0,Telmisartan,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 6, 2020",5,"I have a combination of cardiac anomalies, including but not limited to paroxysmal asymptomatic atrial fibrillation, post stent RCA, slightly elevated BP; general cardiovascular risk. I was on branded Micardis for several years. Then the military formulary went to a generic not packaged in UD. Clearly they had to coat the tabs with something to prevent absorption of moisture from the air, since telmisartan is quite hygroscopic. I had a horrid reaction within three days. My  Pharmacist at the Navy Pharmacy where I go said she was pretty sure the problem was in the coating. I had received the Ascend generic when I was in Phoenix at a WalMart pharmacy; when I went to renew they also had only tabs in a bottle. Now, I had taken your generic with no issues whatsoever. Problem now is that NO ONE has your generic telmisartan and I am stuck in a really scary place. I have no idea where to turn.",Bobolink
