0,Brilinta,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 20, 2021",2,"After a heart attack and stent placement, I've taken this for about six weeks.  Side effects seem to be extreme shortness of breath.  Between refills, I ran out and went two days without it.  Those were the only two days since that I've felt like myself and had any energy or strength, the difference was like night and day.",ljorange
