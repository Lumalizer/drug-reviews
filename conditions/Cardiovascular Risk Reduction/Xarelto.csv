0,Xarelto,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,7,,"October 7, 2020",11,"7 months arm & leg cramps. I ask about blood clot. Dr was certain I didn’t have clot. Trip to urgent care. Dr laughed when asked about blood clot. On discharge: You DO NOT HAVE BLOODCLOT. I’m 50, healthy. Run a lot average 12k steps/day. Resting heart rate 56. She says overuse injury. PCP agreed to ultrasound & finds clot, not DVT, superficial in thigh, 3 cm from femoral junction. Hematology says 30-days Xarelto. Took at 8pm 1st 2 nights. Pains & worse cramping than original. Next 3 nights all Xarelto horror story. Muscle pain, cramps, feeling like peeling muscles from thighs & calves like picking at fried chicken. I found this forum 6th night. Saw comments about taking X with dinner, not after. 10 days ago I started taking med as I ate dinner. Holy smokes! 90% of pains are gone. I do feel nauseous with in 90 minutes after breakfast and/or lunch, which I chalk up as another side effect & does go away as soon as I eat something small like nuts. Only 10 more days!",Mando
