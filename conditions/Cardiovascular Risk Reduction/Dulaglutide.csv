0,Dulaglutide,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,1,,"March 12, 2022",1,"Trulicity (dulaglutide):I have been on Trulicity for about 3 months.   The worst 3 months of my life.  After having severe stomach pains I was referred to a surgeon to have an endoscopy and colonoscopy after a CT scan showed acute Pancreatitis, and numerous other stomach issues.  The surgeon only told me I needed to review my medications with my doctor.   Never once telling me of the complications with Trulicity!  I experienced every side effect from blurred vision to severe cramping, abdominal pain, racing heartbeat, fatigue, to constant diarrhea.   This drug needs to be removed.    I have been in so much indescribable pain that anxiety and depression kicked in.  Not knowing what was wrong.   I am waiting for it to leave my body.   This has been a complete nightmare.",AngieDawn

3,Dulaglutide,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 4, 2021",0,"Trulicity (dulaglutide):Hello Everyone, My doctor suggested I go on Trulicity as I had to lose weight and prevent my insulin resistance from becoming Diabetes type 2. I am also taking Metaphormin 750 x 2 a day. This is my first week. Yes, I had, headache, nausea. I also realized I have acid reflux if I eat processed foods or fried foods. That leads me to eat healthier and much less, thus I'm losing weight. I feel better this morning, and I mean better from the symptoms but also better than how I usually feel in the morning; More energetic, more focused!But I am super terrified from the reviews I am reading here, which are mostly negative. And I don't want to cause any serious issues to myself just trying to prevent Diabetes. Anyway, good luck to everyone here and great health!",Maria_45
4,Dulaglutide,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 6, 2021",1,"Trulicity (dulaglutide):I've been on Trulicity for 6 weeks. Two weeks on .75 mg and three weeks on 1.50 mg. I've lost around 15 lbs. My morning sugars are around 88-110. That's just amazing. I'm also not hungry. I keep forgetting to cut my portions down, but after a few bites I'm done. I have had some gastro issues, but I'm getting used to them and they're calming down. Mostly the disgusting ""eggy"" burps after sitting or standing from a lying position and excess gas. Eating earlier, along with not having cravings to eat later in the day really helps with both. I do notice that the drug starts to wear off a day or two before my next injection; my appetite increases, my AM sugars are a little higher and the gastro issues start hitting me. Out of three boxes, I haven't had any pen failure, it's so easy to use and so far the gastro issues do not outweigh the amazing benefits. I'll know in a month how low I've gotten my A1C, but I already know it's going to be incredible.",emmarie
5,Dulaglutide,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 17, 2021",27,"Trulicity (dulaglutide):My doctor injected me with a trulicity pen on Friday in her office. As time has gone on, now Sunday, I'm so sick. I have severe abdominal pain, extremely sick feeling, threw up once, have diarrhea, terrible sulphur burps and gas. No appetite which I suppose is a good thing to a point but I'm scared to eat due to the nauseating feeling. Over all I just don't feel good. I can not wait for it to wear off. I will never take this medication again, these side effects are not worth it.",Breezy

The injection is  is easy for me and I get no bruising. I felt a little nauseous, but nothing bad. Lost 4lbs in 5 days. Loving it",Chris
7,Dulaglutide,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2020",35,"Trulicity (dulaglutide):I was prescribed this for weight loss and it has been the worst thing ever. Bedridden and unable to work for 6 days now. Vomiting and diarrhea the whole day. Complete loss of control of my bowels. Unable to care for my kids. BP dropped to 74/48 at one stage, been to ED yesterday for IV fluids but today it's worse than ever! Severe gastric upset, gas, pain, weakness, fatigue. Constant nausea that maxalon and ondanz doesn't touch! I feel so awful! Don't risk this! I have heard of many now who have had these severe symptoms. I have not been this sick in 15 years! Diarrhea every 15-30 mins using nappy rash cream on my bum now. Nightmare!",Zoe
