0,Vascepa,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 22, 2022",0,"Not only does Vascepa lower my triglycerides, it works better than any antidepressant on the market.  Maybe it's my body chemistry, but about 3-4 weeks after taking the medication, my mood has vastly improved and has remained positive for the last three years.  Love it.  It's not cheap ($60 for a 90 day  supply with my insurance), but it's well worth it!",Yankman
1,Vascepa,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 13, 2021",4,"I'm taking vascepa to lower levels of triglycerides, 2 milligrams a day, after a few days develop small rash in face and also swelling under my big toes.  I called cardiologist said it's not gout ,but recommended I stopped taking it and consult with primary doctor. So now I have a six month supply that I paid $308 for it and it might be useless to me.  Mind you that's with insurance without insurance $1,174 not cheap. As yo can imagine not happy about the situation.",titi
2,Vascepa,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 27, 2020",3,"After having to do some back and forth with my insurance company, they finally approved Vascepa because I couldn't afford it otherwise.  I've been taking just 2 pills once a day for about 6-7 weeks.  I had blood work done in July and then again a couple weeks ago and my triglycerides have dropped from 245-179.  I don't remember the last time my number was that low.  I don't have any other side effects, good or bad, but I'm glad my numbers are dropping.  This may help me get off 2 other meds I'm on.",KMW

4,Vascepa,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 15, 2020",15,I am taking  2-1 gm  Vascepa and  2- 90mg Brillinta together after having stents put in two of the arteries coming off my LAD. I started out with just one 1 gm Vascepa per day and then graduated to 2 on advice of my pharmacist. I have irritable bowel and with taking 2 Vascepa now it seems to be aggravating this condition.,Allergic to statins
5,Vascepa,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 25, 2020",16,"Have Aortic Stenosis and a 138 score Triglycerides  BEFORE taking  Vecepa. I took Vecepa to lower my score under 100. LOLOL  in 6 months my score was ""198""  .  Sought out other reviews. After reading these reviews, I feel Vecepa  will NOT help me meet any beneficial goals.",Steven
