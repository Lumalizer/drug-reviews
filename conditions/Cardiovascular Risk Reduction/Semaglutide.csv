0,Semaglutide,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 26, 2022",2,"Ozempic (semaglutide):I always had some side effects of Ozempic. Mainly exhaustion, nauseous, occasional throwing up after eating, constipation. As month 3 came and the dose increased to 1mg, I ended up in the Emergency room. I was vomiting and had liquid diarrhea for 4 days. My heart rate was elevated and my potassium was dangerously low. At the time, I thought it was a stomach bug-until the next injection caused the same effects. I've been on ant-nausea medication since. I can see why it takes the appetite away-being exhausted and nauseous 24/7 is terrible. Potassium is still not where it should be. Hoping this gets out of my system fast.",Shy shy
1,Semaglutide,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 23, 2022",2,"Ozempic (semaglutide):I started ozempic for weight loss, started with 0.25 then 0.5, then 0.75 all this in 7 weeks. I lost 7 kilos in 6 weeks. But I was extremely nauseated and exhausted most of the time. Another thing I found and would love to know if anyone else experienced it. It extremely triggered my Adenomyosis. I was constantly bleeding and had severe stomach and back pain. I just got off Ozempic, to see if it will settle. Apparently they say bleeding has nothing to do with it, but when is missed an injection after a few days everything settled. I think this is an unreported maybe rare side effect.",Ronny

Have regularly put on 30kgs over the past 5 years up to 114kg, have extreme fatigue, spine issues and severe leg pain/body aches. Was prescribed Ozempic to assist with weight loss as nothing else worked. I was very worried about side effects and it not working, after reading reviews. Started my .25mg dose 3 days ago, injecting in the upper thigh just before bed, but didn't get full dose as I pulled it out a tad early. Had some mild nausea the next morning that only lasted a few minutes and developed a headache, but panadol took care of that. I didn't notice much the first day and was worried that it wasn't going to work. However, day 2, I was only able to eat about 1/3 of my dinner and felt full. Have already lost .5kg in just the 3 days. No other side effects that I can tell. Though I do feel more thirsty and am a bit tired; however, that's normal for me so can't say it's a side effect.

I had horrible nausea from the beginning along with vomiting and headaches 5 out of 7 days a week. I kept being told side effects will get better but they just got worse. This is my 5 and final month on it. I literally don't remember the last time I was able to eat. 6 of the last 10 days I wasn't even able to keep liquids down and became severely dehydrated. I had the absolute worst headache of my life. I've lost 12 pounds in 9 days and not one pound of weight loss is worth it.

And even though it's been almost 3 months, I still get nausea from time to time. I also had to dial back a lot of my social drinking as I'm eating so little, there's nothing to absorb the alcohol in my stomach most days, causing indigestion, acid reflux, vomiting and other problems.

I would compare it to the feeling you get after overeating and you don't want to look at, smell, hear about what you just ate for the rest of your life.After the injection, which I opted to put in my thigh for hopes of fewer side effects, I did feel queasy, did have a headache and some visual ghosting, but that disappeared within a few hours and now I'm just not hungry.

(admit defeat) Severe and profuse diarrhea, ++ nausea, and bouts of ++ vomiting, and stomach pain all the time caused me to give up on this drug. Lost only 5 pounds in 5 weeks, and I'm sure it was from the extreme GI issues, and inability to eat more than 500-600 calories on bad days - mostly just soup! Felt like I had food poisoning for 6 weeks straight. Was hopeful for this drug, but it totally didn't work for me, and the side effects were unbearable - and I'm a tough cookie.",Terapin

The first two days I had a headache and a flu like feeling. Throughout the week I felt nausea almost daily, bouts of diarrhea and bloated. Today is my second dose of .25 and I lost 4 pounds in 7 days (probably the fact that anytime I eat my next bowel movement is diarrhea) I have felt a general unwellness for the last 7 days and am anxious how this week will go as I haven't been able to accomplish what I normally am able too. If this week gets worse and I start vomiting and being really unwell then I will stop taking this medication. I definitely don't have the same appetite I did before and my junk food craving has basically been vanquished however. If the symptoms don't peter out or they get worse I don't see the point as it affects my sons life as well when I can't be the best mom I can be.",Meggs

In the first week  I vomited once and constant nausea. Week 2 no vomiting just nausea. Week 3 uncontrollable vomiting.  Have been to ER twice on fluids. Zofran won’t stop the vomiting. Now on a suppository to stop it as I can’t take anything orally. Still vomiting. Cannot hold anything down even fluids. Have been off work all week feeling absolutely horrible. Not worth it.

A day and it’s more than enough, instead of contact thoughts of food I do other things that I USED to enjoy: exercise, etc. I am worried coming off ozempic before I lose all weight I need.

This drug has been amazing. At first I had a few side effects which included nausea and constipation but they did resolve. I noticed almost immediately how much better I felt on this drug. Not only was my appetite significantly decreased I felt better overall sort of like my metabolism was more even and my body utilized what I ate more efficiently. I lost my work insurance in November and also lost the coverage for the Ozempic. This is the only downfall. I do have private insurance through health partners but not one cent is covered by them. The price per month is around $800. With results this good all insurance company’s should be covering the cost 100% because it will save them millions, billions, even trillions possibly in the future.

My only complaint is severe acid reflux, all day, all night. Dr told me to take 40mg of prilosec in the morning and 40mg at night (4 pills total). It worked but now I'm concerned about this chemical cocktail I'm putting into my body just to lose weight, not sure if it's worth it longterm. But Ozempic does work!

So, after all sorts of natural therapies and a ton of exercise nothing helped very much. My GP mentioned Ozempic, even though I was only pre diabetic she still felt it would help. After the usual low dose start -6 weeks later up to 1mg. I have been injecting weekly and 6 months later, I am not only 30 lbs down I feel so brilliant. More energy, better sleep and no sugar cravings at all. It has been great. No side effects, maybe a little constipation at the start (mainly due to change of eating habits) Superb med, wish more people could be offered the chance to use it.

I have been off of it for two weeks and feel much better now.  I have noticed it has slowed my digestion majorly which doesn’t sound like a good side effect as food can become very toxic if it sits in the body too long.

That pushed me into the pre-diabetic range, weighing 227 lbs.I recently returned to my doctor, and she switched me to Effexor. In addition, I was referred to an endocrinologist to help me figure out how to tackle the weight gain.The endocrinologist started me on 3mg of Rybelsus. At the 14-day mark, I had lost 2-3 lbs and felt that the 3mg was powerful enough to decrease my appetite without making me too nauseous. Because of that, the endocrinologist decided to keep me on 3mg for a second month.Next week I will reach 60 days on 3mg of Rybelsus, and I have already lost 10 lbs. I'm starting to see my appetite increase slightly, so I'm going to ask if I can move up to the 7mg dosage.This drug makes it very for me difficult to overeat - I feel full very quickly, and if I try to eat something closer to my usual amount, I end up with genuine stomach pain.",owlet
