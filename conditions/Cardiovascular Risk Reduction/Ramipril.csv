0,Ramipril,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 31, 2021",0,"I am having a completely identical experience to W9 Boy:Taken for 1 to 2 yearsSeptember 16, 2021I've been on 1.25 Ramapril since a valve replacement last year. I take it at night. It gives me tinnitus, patchy skin, cough and I feel tired a lot. I was taking Beta blockers as well for a few weeks but stopped. Average BP has gone down from 135/90 to 122/78. But don't know if it's worth it. Can't see a doctor as I'm in London and the wheels have completely come off our National Health Service - it's in chaosWhy isnâ€™t howling tinnitus listed as a side effect?? I stopped taking it and It not only went away, but I felt hugely better generally. Got chatting to a doctor (in a pub, not possible to get appointment) and he advised taking them again so tinnitus is back.",Valve man

2,Ramipril,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 10, 2020",10,Been on Ramipril for two weeks for 140/87 BP and I could handle the light head and lethargy but what I cannot handle is the risk albeit small of lung cancer which some reports on the internet have shown. It is a very small risk but with cancer in my family I am terrified of any risk.,Phil
3,Ramipril,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,10.0,,"August 23, 2019",10,"I am answering 'Anonymous' 31st Oct 2018.I had a heart attack two months ago.  I didn't realise what it was.  The next day I went to my doctor and ended up in hospital.  My right main artery was almost blocked and two stents were fitted.  My heart was (mercifully) undamaged and I am fine now, with no symptoms and I really wouldn't even know that anything had even happened to me.  Re Ramipril, I am currently on 2.5 mg and my pharmacist (UK) wants to get me up to the max dose of 10mg as long as I can tolerate it, and it seems that I can since so far I have had no side affects whatsoever.  However I am questioning the point of it in exactly the same way as you.  I think the reason is that after a cardiovascular event, it is better for the heart to have an easier time and very low blood pressure helps with that.  I am also on beta blockers (Bisaprol),  aspirin and a big (80mg) statin.  It heartens (pun intended!) me to hear that you obviously doing well after all these years :-)",Nobody in particular
4,Ramipril,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 31, 2018",28,"I had a mild heart attack in 2001 at the age of 62, and was put on bisoprolol aspirin and ramipril. I then had another 3 or 4 attacks in 2005 and had one stent fitted. Since then I have had no further trouble but I remained on the medication. I have asked several times why I am on Ramipril as I have never suffered from high blood pressure. The answer I got was that it was ""good for the heart"" somewhat vague advice.  Can anyone suggest why patients who do not suffer from high blood pressure are on it?",Anonymous
5,Ramipril,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,6.0,,"November 11, 2016",21,"Seems that I am 'Hypersensitive' to the extent that exposure to normal  summer sunlight, even with high UV resistant clothing, causes skin pain sometimes so much that I have to stay in the shade.Poor sleep, very low blood pressure and consequent dizziness, loss of balance  and poor concentration.This is the effect of only 5mg daily; it is just not acceptable and there are alternatives available.",Taffy T
6,Ramipril,Cardiovascular Risk Reduction,9.0,,"June 12, 2016",33,"I have had two heart attacks (one never knew I'd had).  The second one did know about it and taking 10mg Ramipril as well as other drugs as preventative measure to further cardiac events.  I never had high BP, but now it's too low according to some professionals, and normal to others 110/60.  Downside: I have to be careful when standing too quickly, if I look up I can lose my balance, I sweat more, I have constant dry mouth, and need to hydrate more.  I can't seem to get a good night's sleep am constantly waking and fidgeting, I have developed tinnitus, biggest down side through lack of sleep I can't wake up and feel drugged when I do.  Upside: Most of these side effects are documented so I put up with them as the opposite is unthinkable.",LittleM
