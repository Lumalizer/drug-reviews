0,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 5, 2022",0,"I have Hashimoto's for over 20 years. I was taking Thyrohormone 0,1 for all my life and my condition was always under control. My last doctor prescribed me Euthyrox 88 and after 6 months my TSH was 9,5. He told me to increase the dose and after 6 more months on Euthyrox 125 my TSH has increased more. Now my TSH is 10,56 and my thyroid gland is in an awful condition. This drug is a nightmare. Stay away.",Katreen
1,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 11, 2021",4,Walmart switched me from levrothyroxine in August to euthyrox. I started feeling lethargic and not doing well. I didn’t know the cause until I switched back to levothyroxine.  Euthyrox medication doesn’t work and I am throwing away what I have left. Cannot believe Walmart can just switch your medication without your approval. I will not use their pharmacy again!,Not a good drug
2,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 18, 2021",1,"I had been on Levothyroxine for nearly 10 years when Walmart decided another cheaper drug was better (Euthrox). I noticed issues within a week but didn't realize it was the change. I saw my PCP and told I felt ""off"" and could she check my levels. Omg- yes the new brand changed everything.  She adjusted my meds and then the fun began. I started having breathing issues so badly I ended up in the ER. Of course drs couldn't find a darn thing wrong except hiatal hernia so they blamed it on that. Soon after that surgery I still had breathing issues!! Finally did research on this drug. 2 days of stopping it ( I know, I know!) Magically I could breathe easy again. Hmm. Dr is watching and monitoring my levels closely. I'll update after I've been on the new Synthroid med as no pharmacy can seem to get the drug I had been on.",Grandma Susie
3,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 6, 2021",3,"Euthyrox is terrible!! I felt horrible, sweated profusely, had the worse body odor even right out of the shower, started having vision problems! 5 weeks was all I took it for. This garbage should not be taken by anyone! I would give it a minus rating!",Dee
4,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,,"July 8, 2021",6,"This medication made it hard to even function. I felt awful, no appetite, sleepy all the time, couldn't even remember how to do math or where I was going. This medication is a definite no for me. I will never take it again. Now that I am off I feel great again!",H
5,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 9, 2021",31,"I've been on Levothyroxine for over 10 years and haven't had any issues. All my levels have been great. Wal-Mart pharmacy prescribed Euthyrox in place of my Levothyroxine, stating it was the same and it is NOT THE SAME!! After two months of missed periods, weight gain, brain fog, moody, depression, etc. and now my blood work has CONFIRMED my levels are all off balance for the first time in over 10 years!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE!! Wal-Mart, please STOP using this!! My Dr. has switched my prescription to Walgreen's and I am now back on Levothyroxine once again and throwing Euthyrox in the TRASH!! Beware it is not the same and you will be messed up!! Euthyrox should be removed and I am reporting it everywhere I can report it!!",Jen312
6,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,,"April 12, 2021",15,"I am so thankful I found this page. I literally thought something was seriously wrong. I have had the same exact experience as all the 1 star reviews. Unfortunately, I have been too ignorant of the change to put how I am feeling and the med switch together until now. I would give a negative number on effectiveness of this drug if I could. It was like taking a sugar pill.",JJ
7,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 3, 2021",5,"I was switched by Walmart. On it 1 week. Hair starting falling out, joint swelling, headaches, sweats, so sleepy and felt like heart beat in my ear and rash. Switching back to levothyoxine. I have Hashimotos.",Mick
8,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 27, 2021",7,"I find it interesting to read some of the comments that are posted on this site.  In my experience with thyroid disease, I have experienced different pharmacies carry different levothyroxine made by different companies.  They all carry a similar side effect profile.  With that said, my experience has been positive.  I have seen better numbers.  I used to take a product made in Puerto Rico and I found my TSH would go all over the place and I would take this faithfully...Euthyrox has improved my numbers, simply put...I appreciate that Walmart carries this. I realize everyone's experience can be different.  Mine has been a positive one and I like paying $4/month.  I remember the days paying >$100 on Synthroid...My numbers are fine and the side effects are what I've always experienced before on different levo products.",Sam T
9,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,,"December 11, 2020",28,Walmart switched my prescription from levothyroxine to Euthyrox about 4 months ago.  I noticed that I had been feeling off for a long time but chalked it up to 2020 blues.  I started having terrible heart palpitations though and knew something was wrong.  Went to GP and she put me on an anxiety med.  I didn’t think to tell her that they switched the prescription because the pharmacist told me it was the same medication.  The palpitations continued and they got so bad that my husband started looking up reviews for everything I take including vitamins and found out that this drug causes heart issues.  I called my doc and got it switched back.  The pharmacy tried to give me Euthyrox again and said that they have to special order the levothyroxin and it costs 5x as much as it used to.  This sucks.,Notalone
10,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 9, 2020",16,"Nope.  Euthyrox is not viable for Hashimotos.  I’ve asked for the pharmacist to continue dispensing the green generic tablets because of severe fatigue, headaches, weight gain, yada yada yada this medicine delivers.  It looks like it may work for a couple of folks here but not the majority.  Even if the pharmacist or doctor looks at you like you have no clue,  every one of us realize that fine line with levothyroxine.  Even in ultra low dosages, sensitive hashimotos patients know right away.  I don't feeling like garbage so I pass.",DeeJay
11,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,,"November 14, 2020",29,"I was switched from my normal levothyroxine to Euthyrox recently because Walmart pharmacy switched me (without asking me).  I was told the blister pack was a better option because it maintains the freshness of the medication which is supposed to make it work better. My TSH typically sits around .9-1.2 and now I’m at 3.69 as of last week. The only thing that has changed is my medication! I’ve felt terrible - very cold, lots of crushing headaches again, joint paint, fatigue...I’m afraid it’s from switching over to this med. I’m calling my endocrinologist to try and move my rx to a different pharmacy to see if I can get off the Euthyrox.",dancemama84
12,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 3, 2020",27,"I was on Levothyroxine for three years.  Three months ago Walmart (without permission) changed my prescription to Euthyrox.  At the time, I didn't think it would matter so I took it as I had my previous med.  I started having leg and hip pain - then extreme brain fog - tingling and numb extremities - depression. I went to to the dr and was told my levels were w/in range.  The dr stated he had not heard of Euthyrox.  Nothing has changed in my life (other than COVID), but the med.  I called Walmart and they told me they could no longer get Levothyroxine.  The pharmacist explained that Euthyrox was much better in foil packs and would not lose its purpose as Levothroxine would once it was open.  After reading other comments, I'm switching back and to another pharmacy",Thatgirl
13,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 24, 2020",34,"Walmart keeps switching my thyroid medication brand. They gave me this one and I googled it. It was recalled in Europe. It is a very dangerous drug. I have contacted my physician and refuse to use it. I do not need more problems. Your pharmacy should never change your thyroid prescription brand. Medications should only be changed for a medical reason, not financial purpose.",Mimi
14,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 23, 2020",30,"I have had Hashimoto's for 8 years.  Tried Levoxyl, Synthroid, Armour thyroid,  Finally went to generic since they all seemed about the same and the cost was far less.  I felt great, very stable TSH etc.  Walmart switched to Euthrox with my last refill and I feel absolutely horrible.  Low energy, weight gain, complete brain fog and many many more. Since it was a new med, I alternated it every other day with my old generic and this. Felt ok, so I swithched to Euthrox daily and honestly feel as if I am taking NOTHING.Glad to hear it seems to be an almost universal complaint.  I plan on visiting Walmart tomorrow to see if there is anything they can do about replacing this horrible medication.",LoLo
15,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 1, 2020",87,"I was switched to Euthyrox by the pharmacist at Walmart and did not notice until I got home. I called the pharmacy and asked about the drug, and was told it was the same medication, just another brand. It is not. The first day I took it I had a migraine headache, and shortness of breath. I thought it was just me, so I went on and stayed on the medication for 2 weeks, thinking my symptoms would improve. They got worse. By the time I was 2 weeks in to taking this medication, I could barely get out of bed. It was like being in a fog all the time, with absolutely no relief. I called back and spoke to the pharmacist, this time getting a different person. He told me that my Dr could specify Synthroid and they would make sure to keep it in stock. I messaged my endocrinologist and he quickly sent in the prescription specifying Synthroid only. I am already feeling better. Please do NOT take this medication.",Bee

17,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,3.0,,"August 14, 2020",34,"Started this Euthyrox about a month ago after Walmart switched me to it. Since then I’m having daily headaches, sometimes migraines, more hair loss, and fatigue. Called Walmart and they switched me back to my previous manufacturer with no problem. This brand didn’t work for me.",Akj

Labored breathing - hair loss - blurred vision - fatigue  - chest pain - heart skipping beats - nausea - insomnia -   was taking a little oblong yellow levorthyroxin that worked great - drug store changed companies and this pill is round white.,LJL
19,Euthyrox,Hashimoto's disease,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 27, 2020",16,Started taking Euthyrox over the past few months after being switched from a previous generic.  Heard that this brand of levothyroxine is priced as a generic which saved me money.  Currently finding more stable TSH levels and appreciate the compliance packaging.,ST1165

It was not until my son started jot down all of my symptoms that I thought were not related, he figured out that my medication was not doing its job. I originally was on synthroid and switched off because of the cost of it even with insurance and I was having regular side effects from the pills.",Lauita
