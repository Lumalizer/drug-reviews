0,NP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 24, 2022",0,"I have been taking NP Thyroid for a year now. They seem to have improved the formula. It is much more affordable and has less fillers than some other popular brands. Tends to be very effective but start out slow with it until you know how it will effect you. It can be sublingual so that gives it a faster absorbing rate, I just try to be consistent, if I take an hour before food",Njrp
1,NP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 22, 2021",1,"I was diagnosed with hashimotos in early 2019. Since then I was on levothyroxine. My thyroid levels were constantly showing as normal on my labs, but I always felt the symptoms of being hypothyroid. I went to an endocrinologist for the first time 2-3 months ago and she prescribed my 90mcg of np thyroid to be taken one half of a tablet daily. I noticed that the pill has a porky smell, like pig sweat? But it doesn’t bother me much and I take it down quickly so I don’t taste it. I have since lost 10lbs and I feel so amazing. I feel like myself again, motivated to clean, clear headed, calm. I really hope that I don’t ever get a bad batch, because I love how I feel on np thyroid.",Mrs. D
2,NP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 5, 2021",5,"Switched from other brand after moving to a naturopath dr to help with my Hashimotos.  I really would not recommend Thyroid NP. For the last 2 years I’ve had stomach burning, enough to make me think it was an ulcer and loss of eyebrows and hair on my head, absolutely zero energy, leg aches,  weight gain and a massively foggy brain as of lately… I’ve been off for 3 days and I can already feel the difference. Leaving my naturopath and heading back to my regular dr for Synthroid.  I didn’t connect the dots until recently. And this stuff is not regulated well, it had 3 recalls in the last year… that’s not good.",Don't use it
3,NP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 19, 2021",4,"My hormone nurse talked me into trying NP Thyroid & I was one it for six months & all was well until I switched to CVS pharmacy to fill the prescription.  Now, 4 months later my TSH is at 9 which is the highest it's been since I first became hypothyroid in 2011.  CRAZY  My endocrinologist was righteously upset with me and has immediate put me back on synthroid & liothyronine separately.  I should've listened to all these negative reviews, but I was open to trying it out because I couldn't believe this stuff could be this harmful & still available!!  DON'T USE IT !!!",DeeDee
4,NP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,7.0,,"August 15, 2021",2,"Stopped responding to Tirosint after couple years, dose was pushed up to point tipped me towards hyperthyroidism - along with a lot of life stressors at once became clinically hyperthyroid. I was waking up shaking with anxiety and had full on mania requiring tons of diazepam to get to baseline of rational thought. Switched to NP 60 and feeling well 6 weeks in. I’m less stressed out, better energy, less joint pain, much less back pain, more focused (less brain fog), have been a bit apathetic but I’m an excellent procrastinator. Everyone is different and endocrine diseases are difficult to stabilize. I have multiple autoimmune diseases and chronic migraines. Still early days on NP. My last labs I was hypo (3 weeks off Tirosint and prior to starting NP). I’ll see what the labs say say but so far so good. He who taste knows. All reviews are anecdotal not empirical. Make your medication choices based on what you and your physician think is appropriate for you, not someone else.",zopdeep
5,NP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,9.0,,"August 10, 2021",1,I’m surprised by all the bad reviews. NP Thyroid works great for me. Much better than synthetic. It does smell like cat pee though which is awful!,Julie
6,NP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,,"June 17, 2021",18,"Please do not take NP Thyroid when I was first diagnosed with hypothyroidism they prescribe me this medication. I wouldn't advise anyone to take it I almost died from it I was going crazy rocking back and forth filling so irritable heart racing,  sweating, wanted to pull my hair out but not just normal side effect - like imagine those side affect x100 and I’m not even being dramatic. I finally had to call 911. I tried to explain to my love ones and all these doctors and E.Rs there’s something really bad with this medication they all said don’t worry keep taking it it’s new and your body is just trying to get use to it. That was rubbish. Please always trust your instincts. I decided to stop that medication on my own it took me like a whole month to recover I was left like I was spinning the whole time I couldn’t walk without holding on to somebody and taking small steps. A year later a get a envelope that it was a drug recall and that they added 100x more of a dose so I was not crazy",Selacortezz

8,NP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,,"April 30, 2021",18,"Was switched to NP thyroid after Naturethroid was recalled. I was doing really well on the Naturethroid, but I tried to stay positive in taking this one. It smells and tastes disgusting. I noticed unexplained pain in my hip, constant indigestion, upset stomach, random diarrhea. 7 months in and my T3 is off the chart, T4 and TSH are super low, basically hyperthyroid. In the past month I developed horrible anxiety, crying randomly and uncontrollably, trouble sleeping, and fatigue. I barely recognize myself. Had a complete breakdown in the middle of an exam. My professors are mad and think I'm somehow incompetent although I kept trying to explain I didn't know what is going on. Finally went to the doctor and found out she had prescribed Armour but my pharmacy was filling NP instead. Am fighting with insurance to get Armour covered, but I can't continue with NP. My temporary dose of Armour already smells better than the NP. I'm praying this works, cause IDK what I'm gonna do if it doesn't.",LV
9,NP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 8, 2021",21,"NP thyroid is HORRIBLE. I have been on Nature Thyroid for 6 years. I have taken two days of this NP and my heart is racing, I can't concentrate and vision changes. I NEED MY NATURE THYROID. What is wrong with pharmaceutical companies.

10,NP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,5.0,,"November 7, 2020",5,Well NDTs are animal products. NP does smell and makes your urine smell too! Urine smells more nitrogenous when you eat meat.  For me it's like that as I rarely eat meat.Excipients binders fillers and contaminants are in ALL meds and some people are more sensitive than others and what is wonderful for one patient is horrible for another.Synthroid made me really sick so I switched to AT and then pharmacy slipped me NP with the Docs ok!  So far I haven't had these relatively common side effect symptoms people are reporting but as far as the smell and taste of NP thyroid it doesnt seem like that is something they are gonna fix.NDTs do require higher doses and longer time frames to lower the TSH.  Lab reference ranges are getting lower all the time.  Buyer beware and be safe!,Leuy
11,NP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 11, 2020",14,"I was originally on generic levothyroxine, which I felt horrible on and had to be given 175mcg to feel even marginally better. Switched doctors and requested Armour, at the time (2014), insurance covered it. Not sure when Armour reformulation happened, but I've always felt at the most NORMAL on it. There was a changed healthcare laws and my insurance booted Armour, so I had to start taking NP. It was awful. I would swing from hyper to hypo in the span of days, constantly losing hair, skin was breaking out and dry, had to take so many supplements to even out the symptoms of Hashimoto's. Was told there was a recall on my NP dose back in June 2020. Decided to switch back to Armour and just pay out of pocket. Three months later, I am feeling like a human being again.",Vp

When I changed pharmacies, they automatically filled my prescription with NP Thyroid.  I'm nearly 90 days into NP Thyroid, and my aches and pains have increased, and I'm exhausted by 3pm.  When I get home from work, I sometimes have to take a short nap just to function.  Also, my nails are breaking.

I became regulated by December 2019. By March 2020 I was hypo again I went in and my dr couldn't believe I had fallen so fast. He is struggling to let me use NDT because he believes in levothyroxine. I increased the dose, 4 weeks later I was almost comatose so I called to raise again. Only mildly better, but still hypo. I talked to the admin of thyroid Facebook page who said stick to armour only!

Then Armour  , that went downhill, I was then put on Naturethroid,  that went downhill and I changed to NP last year . I have become insular,  don't want to go out much, have gained 2 stone, from a size uk 8 to uk 12. Very irritable, angry. Hair loss has increased (it never really stopped, only slowed up) . Skin conditions that went away , granuloma annulare have flared up. General feeling that if I died tomorrow I wouldn't care. I am not depressed . Armour is 400 euro a month here in Ireland now , I can't afford that. Don't know what to do ?

18,NP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2020",38,"I’ve been on Armour thyroid for over 10 years, taking 60mg daily. My prescription got filled with NP thyroid this last time. When I received it, I saw the change, quickly looked it up, saw desiccated  thyroid and figured it was fine. I finished my Armour and switched over.  I was also recently diagnosed with type 2 Narcolepsy for which I’ve been taking Modafinil for the last 4 months. So when I started developing headaches, palpitations, hypertension  and GI bloating, and let’s just say it, farts, I actually thought it was that. Even though it’s only been about of month of those symptoms. Today as I sat here and pondered why the headaches, and increase in BP, I thought of the thyroid medication switch and started poking around. And here I found some answers. Along with reading the differences in Armour and NP. I won’t take it tomorrow, or the next day, until they give me Armour back. Be alert to what feels good, right and normal.

19,NP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 16, 2020",28,"I am glad I checked this page as I thought I was going crazy. I noticed that the NP Thyroid pill thickness had changed as well as the color, and it had a much ""sweeter"" taste to the pill, from what I had been taking. I chalked it up to different batch, but since taking the new pill, I have had muscle aches, rapid heart rate, blurred vision, back aches and joints that are ""out"" or popping, along with a bad ""do not care"" attitude. I have made a complaint to the manufacturer in hopes of getting my money refunded, to go back on Armour Thyroid. Awaiting the results of that... The biggest issue I have is now I will need to start another medicine and get blood checks ($$$) to get the dosage dialled in, after taking a year to get it finally right this last time! THANKS NP!!!

It changed on October 2019. It appears a sweetener and something else added to the pills. More fillers and less medicine. I even enquired at the pharmacy that I got it from if there was an ingredient change. They checked the computer and said no. I haven’t felt well since the change.,Littlet

I had zero energy, could barely walk down the stairs, deep hip pain. I examined the pills and they looked different (speckles) and smelled terrible (now smelled like cat pee, instead of just kind of unpleasant). Thankfully, I had some of my old batch left and resumed taking that and immediately talked to my doctor about switching to a synthetic T4 / T3 combo so this wouldn't happen again. I've been on the new meds for 5 day and not feeling well yet. Not sure if it's from the doses of bad NP I took or just getting used to new meds. This is just heartbreaking.

I react like there’s something I have an intolerance to.  My throat burns and my stomach hurts plus the nausea all day.  I cannot eat.  I had my doctor switch me to Armour but with all my intolerances plus Celiac my abdomen blew up and I was so bloated I felt like I couldn’t breathe.  I honestly don’t know what to do now.

My dosage has just been increased, but I have had zero side effects and feel great on it. It really goes to show that we are all so different and what works for one person may not for another. Good luck to each of you on your journey to feel better.",goody2shoeskat

I  have Hashimoto's but never experienced anything close to what people are describing here. NP thyroid is the same for me as Nature Throid and I can't really tell the difference. Only once did lower dose of Armour set things off with my TSH and luckily I found whatever else was in stock. I was never on synthetic thyroid meds and never will. In fact, looking ways and modifying my diet to get off meds once and for all.",bo

Had heart palpitations, highs and lows.  The Stop The Thyroid Madness Support Group I follow has its members highly recommending NP by Acella.  However I do not understand the shortages in these thyroid medications when they are so desperately needed!  The AMA has a lot of catching up to do because their protocol is counter intuitive and productive for patients like me who have been UN and UNDER Diagnosed for years!  Time to wake up !",GAT

Dr. upped me to 90mg about 3 weeks ago, again, with no improvement.  I feel like I am taking a worthless placebo and am wasting my time and now, my local pharmacies are having trouble filling it due to a warehouse backorder.  At least there have been no side-effects for me, but I'd rather have some minor side-effect with a drug that does what it's supposed to than something that doesn't work at all.",beckster308

I’ve missed 4 of the last 5 days  work (I’m rarely take leave) because driving the hour to work is too exhausting.

I've been using it for only a couple of weeks, but the transition was completely seamless. I'm sleeping much better and feel well. The biggest surprise is I no longer have problems moving my bowels. On nature thyroid I would need the aid of stool softeners and other products and would still struggle to produce 3 or 4 bowel motion's in a week. Now, on NP thyroid I go effortlessly a minimum of TWICE daily like clockwork. I have never been this regular. Very happy with NP thyroid!",katydid

I had been taking levothyroxine for 7 years and continued to feel awful- always tired and gained weight like crazy. I recently found a new primary care physician and OBGYN that both recommended I try NP thyroid (and selenium) given my continued and worsening symptoms taking levothyroxine. I think my NP thyroid dosage was too high the first time I started taking it because I felt extreme anxiety, my heart racing, little appetite and I would cry probably every other day for no reason. I was taking this 60 mg NP thyroid for 6 weeks. After reporting the side effects I experienced to my doctor, she cut my dosage in half for now and my side effects have subsided. I do have to say that despite cutting the dosage, I am feeling better then I had been while taking Levothyroxine.",ali g
65,NP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 31, 2018",28,"After a 3 years of a hellish ordeal with Synthroid, I decided to quit thyroid hormone replacement. Synthroid was literally killing me. The worst I've ever felt. 6 months after stopping Synthroid, I was ""allowed"" to take NDT. I took Armour for over a year, and while it worked great to suppress TSH, I still had hypo symptoms. After 15 months on Armour, I was accidentally dispensed NP Thyroid without knowing what it was. After I verified it to be an NDT, I took it. After 2 months on NP, I didn't feel perfect, but noticed the sweating was gone and constipation resolved. After 4 months, everything going well, pharmacy corrected their ""mistake"" and gave me Armour. Back to the constipation/sweating. I had to fight to get back NP. Five months, no excessive sweating or constipation, and I'm dreaming again (yay 4 REM) and taking less naps in the P.M., like I used to do as if my life depends on it. I recommend you try NP Thyroid if you have T4-to-T3 conversion issues. I wish you the best and I hope you regain your life.",Daisy Martinelli

I would give it a ""10"" but it's very very hard to get exactly right....you will have ups and downs.  Which technically isn't the fault of the medication.  Don't increase your dosage too quickly...happened to me a few times.  BE PATIENT and RESEARCH.  It will take time to get back to ""normal"".  Good luck and DON'T QUIT!",DZG333
