0,WP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,,"December 10, 2021",0,"I am amazed by the resemblances between my own experiences and those that I read here.  After many years of struggling to find the right doses of T3/t4, my doctor recommended WP thyroid. I lost 30 lbs without any effort on my part…I felt wonderful, like I had my old self back again.  Then, August 2018, my doctor ran out of WP and suggested I take NatureThyroid, made by the same company.  After 10 days on it, I found myself out of breath all the time, and if I exerted any kind of effort, I had to stop to catch my breath.  It got so bad, I could barely climb the stairs to our bedroom.  I started having tightening in my chest, and I felt like my lungs were glued together … I couldn’t get any air! A GP said I was having bronchial spasms, and put me on prednisone, and antibiotics, and puffers! I felt like I was dying! I got worse and still couldn’t breathe! After 3 months I stopped taking WP and had instant relief!  A day without breathing issues! This is Indeed poison!",Amy
1,WP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,2.0,,"March 3, 2020",22,"Yes since the recall there has been nothing but terrible results from wp thyroid and nature thyroid as well. Before you could lose weight , feel great, take on the day. Now just the opposite they definitely have made changes to it and don't want tell us. But hopefully someone in the government will expose their lies. Cause it worse than ever.",Ms Kay
2,WP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 16, 2019",42,"The WP Thyroid tablets that are now available after the shortage is absolutely the worst, it is NOT the same as before. My body felt dangerously poisoned, I will never use anything ever again from RLC labs as I feel they’re lying regarding what happened with WP Thyroid and what was really going on during shortage.",Nick

4,WP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 23, 2019",33,"WP thyroid worked so well for me before the shortage, I was feeling good and losing weight.  I was so excited when it started coming back, over a year later!  What a disappointment.  It has changed and do not let anyone tell you any different.  After a week of taking it I was so sick, I literally could not get out of bed.  Test results proved it did not work the same.  NO thanks WP thyroid, what I disappointment you turned out to be and it costs more too!  Shameful",Wisconsin
5,WP Thyroid,Hashimoto's disease,10.0,,"March 7, 2017",35,"This has saved my life. I was on Levothyroxine for 8 years, and it didn't help my fatigue, pain, insomnia, or weight. I've been on WP thyroid for 5 month and have lost 36 pounds and am no longer at risk for diabetes, and feel like a new person. I still struggle with depression and anxiety, but I feel this medication is amazing.",Mich911
