2,Unithroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 28, 2019",15,"When the medication was made by Johnson-Stevens, it worked very well.  Iâ€™ve been on it for over 10 years.  The past couple years, something changed and it stopped working.  After taking it in the morning, I had a metallic taste in my mouth and made me very tired.
