It caused heaviness in my chest, felt like it was more difficult to breathe, and caused me to feel very depressed. I took it for a month and said no more. I am back on Levoxyl now and all of those horrible symptoms went away almost immediately.  I have tried several different levothyroxine brands and it’s so difficult to find the correct one.  The batches seem to be inconsistent lately as well for both Synthroid and Levoxyl. But if you’re having horrible side effects from Synthroid please switch to a different brand.

She adjusted my meds and then the fun began. I started having breathing issues so badly I ended up in the ER.

I have been on Tirosint for a little over a year and have noticed a great improvement to the point of not having hypothyroid symptoms. I would suggest the makers of Tirosint should make it clear of the importance of allowing  4 hours from taking the medication and eating or taking other supplements so it does not interfere.

I have been on this medication for 8 years now.  When I started out with it, I had many of the same symptoms of all of you for about nine months.  During that time I went thru 5 medication adjustments. Started out at 25 mcg , then ended up at 100mcg. Then went to taking the 100 mcg 5 times a week and cutting the pill in half two days.What worked for me is the following:-Take exactly the same time every morning-Do not eat or drink anything within the hour after that-Some medications and supplements interfere with the absorption  of it.  Take them 4 to 6 hours before or after. This is important because Synthroid is a narrow therapeutic dosing drug.

I also noticed a higher metabolism, as well a longer attention span and a better ability to focus.  I did not ever see any difference in my intolerance to cold, the dryness of my skin and barely to what I thought to be the worst Hashimoto symptom, the lethargy.  I did notice if I took this medicine at night or later in the day it made my heart race.  I think this medicine affects everyone differently and results are hindered by people having too high of expectations.  For me it was a great medicine, it didn't solve all of the problems but as someone truly suffering from Hashimoto's, I am extremely grateful for what it has done.",Anonymous
