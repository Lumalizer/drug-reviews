0,Synthroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 14, 2022",4,"Like many I was doing amazing on Nature Throid until about 2017 and since then I have bounced from no medication and from tirosint and synthroid. Synthroid has been the worst decision of my life! I’m feel so sad and depressed, which probably has to do with a 40lb weight gain after switching to synthetic meds. I truly wished this worked for me!",Pga0919
1,Synthroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 8, 2022",1,"I have been taking Levoxyl for the past 10 years and doing well on it. Then all of a sudden I was having severe hyperthyroid symptoms after my dose was increased  and I was switched to Synthroid. This stuff feels like poison. It caused heaviness in my chest, felt like it was more difficult to breathe, and caused me to feel very depressed. I took it for a month and said no more. I am back on Levoxyl now and all of those horrible symptoms went away almost immediately.  I have tried several different levothyroxine brands and it’s so difficult to find the correct one.  The batches seem to be inconsistent lately as well for both Synthroid and Levoxyl. But if you’re having horrible side effects from Synthroid please switch to a different brand.  It really makes a difference.",Frustrated
2,Synthroid,Hashimoto's disease,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 6, 2021",2,"Have been taking this in the morning for years, recently I started taking it several hours before I fully wake up-I dont have the time every morning to take it & wait to eat or drink. Prior to this I would have enlarged thyroid, extreme fatigue, overt emotional distress & body aches & pains. Current TSH is 1.3, at diagnosis it was 70.5. I do have celiac disease as well.I have noticed a remarkable difference in my mornings since changing the time I take my synthroid. I wake up with a clear mind, I feel like I actually slept, & my body doesn't hurt just from existing. Neck feels normal throughout the day instead of fluctuating throughout various stages of inflammation, & temperature intolerance is not that bad. Without this I would be back to barely functioning & my body would be at full gear developing more unsavory and life damaging diseases. First & foremost my goal is to halt the progression of this disease.",__up_to_something

4,Synthroid,Hashimoto's disease,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 29, 2020",15,Started Synthroid 50 mcgs on August 25th 2020. I was 6’3 at 266 lbs. It is now October 28th 2020 and I have lost 49 pounds. My weight is 217lb. If you have hashimotos disease. I highly recommend the paleo or AIP diet. All I did was diet and take my meds every day at 9 a.m on an empty stomach with water. I would then wait till 12 before I would eat lunch to make sure all of the meds absorbed. My antibody count is still unreadable so I have to up my dose to 75 mcgs now. Needless to say this medicine seems to do it’s job. But your diet is nearly as important.,Cory

6,Synthroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,,"March 17, 2020",52,"Synthroid is terrible it fave me an exacerbation of mental health symptoms! Nervous, restless, anxiety, fatigue, constant dark thoughts and depression. My TSH dropped from .50 to .02 and still no symptoms of hyper just the same symptoms of hypo. Weight gain, tired, depression. I thought I was losing my mind! Trying to adjust psyche meds thinking that was the issue didn't work cuz it was the levo causing the problem. It's difficult to separate symptoms of mental health problems from thyroid problems because they can be similar. Got a referral from PCP to see an Endocrinologist. They switched me to Armour. Significant improvement. Levothyroxine stinks! I'd rather take no thyroid medication and suffer the consequences than take Levothyroxine. ",Anonymous
7,Synthroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 3, 2020",91,"This stuff is just awful ! I’ve had my TSH go as high as 52.0 (wasn’t aware is was that out of control) and felt better than, than I do now on years of treatment on brand name synthroid! Endocrinologist just doesn’t seem to agree ? And now I have a whole new set of symptoms such as itchiness all over, horrible anxiety, headaches, weight gain, the list goes on and on, and nothing new has been added to my daily routine, I know it’s this medication, I hate it. Just throwing this out there for anyone else that so that you know your not crazy ! Good luck !",Doesn’t matter
8,Synthroid,Hashimoto's disease,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 8, 2019",50,"So sorry some of you are having this experience with Synthroid.  I have been on this medication for 8 years now.  When I started out with it, I had many of the same symptoms of all of you for about nine months.  During that time I went thru 5 medication adjustments. Started out at 25 mcg , then ended up at 100mcg. Then went to taking the 100 mcg 5 times a week and cutting the pill in half two days.What worked for me is the following:-Take exactly the same time every morning-Do not eat or drink anything within the hour after that-Some medications and supplements interfere with the absorption  of it.  Take them 4 to 6 hours before or after. This is important because Synthroid is a narrow therapeutic dosing drug.  In other words, if your dose isn't just right, you will experience all the negative side effects of both hypo and drug side effects. - If your  dr isn't willing to adjust the dose for you like my dr has, find another dr.",Dore

10,Synthroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 19, 2019",29,"Was diagnosed  with hashimotos about 2 months ago. I would wake up feeling very fatigued and I would have to take a power nap at work before I could drive home. I  had seen the endocrinologist and he put me on 50 mg of Synthroid once a day. After about two weeks I felt great, l was back to my normal self minus the weight I gained (10 lbs in 2 weeks). Now all the sudden I woke up this past Monday with a migraine and no appetite. Today is Friday, still battling the migraine and have lost 7lbs. Every time I think of food I want to vomit. Had labs done and everything came back normal. Body feels very hot and a lot of sweating. Doc lowered me to 25 mg on Wednesday but still no changes in headache or appetite.",Anonymous
11,Synthroid,Hashimoto's disease,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 1, 2018",46,"I've been taking generic (levothyroxine) for 2.5 years. I took for a little while about 4 years but I didn't keep up with my health as I should have. My TSH was 58.8 and I started on 50 mcg. After seeing my GP and now an Endocrinologist, I am now up to 150 mcg and the last TSH was .99I have had no side effects from either Synthroid or the generic. The medicine does what it's supposed to do. My hair grew back, the fog lifted, got my energy back, severe muscle pain went away, joints no longer hurt and my cholesterol went down from 280 to 200. I take it in the morning but don't follow any rules. The endo just said to take it. I usually take it with my Vitamin D, prescription pepcid, and Vitamin C. I take it with coffee  or milk. The endo said it really didn't matter, just take it because not taking it is not an option.",MissBailey
12,Synthroid,Hashimoto's disease,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 18, 2018",88,"Had my thyroid removed 2 years ago. Was put on synthroid and have felt terrible ever since. Weight gain, joint and muscle pain, blurred vision, tremors, hair loss, constipation, irregular heart beat, stomach problems and the list goes on. Doctor tells me my numbers are fine and I should be put on an anti-depressent. Really. That's because they don't know enough about thyroid disease and keep pushing the drugs. This drug is next to poison but no one listens to us . We are held hostage to these doctors that don't care. Where do we turn to because I we are suffering. Help!!!",Paw

14,Synthroid,Hashimoto's disease,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 6, 2017",43,"Synthroid is only one of the four hormones produced by the thyroid. So it produces about the expected mediocre result. For me it was worse than mediocre, it was horrible, leaving me essentially bed-ridden for almost 3 years. This company has a bad record, andpressure is put on Docs to use this stuff exclusively. Why aren't we offered other options at the start??",davetrindle

For anyone who is on the medication and says they are feeling depressed, tired, etc. check into the symptoms of hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's disease as it may be that your medication is not at the right dose.  My doctor considers 'normal' TSH to be between 1 and 3 while the AMA lists it as between 1 and 5.  When I am at a 4, I do not feel well and have all the symptoms.  DON'T just STOP taking this medication on your own as you can have severe side effects, GO back to your doctor and discuss how you feel.  I cannot take the generics as they do not work for me.
