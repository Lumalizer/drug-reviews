1,Metformin,Insulin Resistance Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 14, 2021",4,"Reading the ones where folks were ""miserable"" and had GI issues from it -  some people have this  from not eating correctly. I immediately noticed a difference in my eating habits. I was full quicker and had more energy. I am bi-polar and am on medications for that but this did help me greatly. I did not want to stop taking Abilify and my doctor prescribed me Metformin and I can honestly say I have never felt better. So please make sure if you have these side effects - try eating better for a few days - more protein and way less carbs. All those carbs turn into sugar etc so that is why you are not feeling well. My doctor told me this from the start and I was like no way...and he was right. I reduced carbs the second week of taking this and have not looked back.",Dawn

I was exercising at a gym 2 hours a day 5 days a week.This was pre-pandemic, I kept a food, weight & exercise diary.Dr prescribed a dose of three 500 mg tablets of Metformin a day, 1 pill to be taken with each meal. I don't eat 3 meals a day, I only eat when my tummy growls. I eat protein, salad with oil & vinegar. Absolutely no wine or alcohol. I eliminated carbs with exception of fresh fruit.Experienced extreme gas, bloating, & felt terrible since 2015.

I declined and haven't taken it for the past 3 days & my husband noticed I was happier,  perkier, had more energy.

5,Metformin,Insulin Resistance Syndrome,3.0,,"March 2, 2021",16,"After a year-long weight loss plateau, I saw my doctor and she prescribed me metformin, saying that it's sometimes used off-label for weight loss. I don't have any conditions that would warrant metformin such as PCOS, diabetes or insulin resistance.I've been on 500mg once daily for 1 month and while I believe it has taken effect, it hasn't helped me lose weight. I notice a significant difference in my appetite, which is helping me to remain within my daily calorie budget. And I'm thankful I did not get the severe digestive upset many people report (I got the extended release one).However, in spite of calorie cutting, 30 minutes of exercise a day, making healthy food choices (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, less meat, more protein) and the metformin, I have lost nothing. In fact, I seem to have gained weight because all my clothes fit tighter nowI'll give it some more time, but aside from appetite reduction, it has been unsuccessful in regard to weight loss for me.",Gina

10,Metformin,Insulin Resistance Syndrome,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2020",29,Had a miscarriage and went up 5 to 7kg in a matter of days. Then would diet and exercise to extreme and come down a 1 or 2 kg after many weeks then suddenly I'd balloon again 5 to 7kg. So just kept getting bigger. Docs kept saying diet exercise. Also had very hard stomach and bloating. Swelling in hands and feet. So bad couldn't wear shoes. Got put on Metformin. Didn't really change diet or exercise and dropped 4.4kg in 12 days.

I have a mental illness and the meds I'm on caused me to gain a little extra weight. There was no way I wanted to change my mental health meds as I didn't want to fall  back into hospital again. Anyway cut the story short I was prescribed metformin months ago. I was 98.2kg I am now 93.5kg I am happy I am losing the weight I have cut down on all the junk foods and added more fruit and salads to my diet.

My endocrinologist decided we could try metformin off-label to see if it would reduce my insulin requirements and help me lose weight after I lost nothing on a 1200 calorie low carb diet in four months of strict compliance. I was having blood sugar spikes during the night from 100 to nearly 400, likely due to my liver releasing glucose. That disappeared after my first dose and I woke up at 102. I'm reducing insulin daily so I should lose some weight finally. I'm only taking half a dose right now but will increase it soon.

Diagnosed with prediabetes by my endo and has never officially crossed threshold for diabetes since being on Metformin. There’s definitely an adjustment curve when beginning this medication; it’s been a while but I remember the first few weeks were full of INTENSE cramping, nausea, gas, loose stools, and strangely enough, back pain. The loose stools don’t really go away but all the other symptoms have pretty much subsided. Despite its unattractive side effects it has really helped me stabilize my weight (I was randomly gaining exponentially) and even curbed cravings.

(My blood sugar sometimes goes down way too low after eating). I decided this morning that maybe I should be back on the metformin so I took 1 at breakfast. Well I don't know if 1 pill can do it, but within an hour I've felt better than I have in months. The shaky weak feeling completely went away and I had a ton of energy since.",vjm
52,Metformin,Insulin Resistance Syndrome,10.0,,"April 1, 2012",192,"My endocrinologist put me on Metformin for what he diagnosed as metabolic syndrome. My general physician sent me to him because he thought I was pre-diabetic. My triglycerides were through the roof....3500 at one point! Prior to starting Metformin I had worked on improving my diet, watching calories and quality of foods I ate and I had seen some moderate weight loss. Once on the metformin, my triglycerides dropped 90% (from 3500 to 350) and the pounds began to drop away....several pounds every few weeks to the point that I am down 42 pounds (from 220 down to 178) in about 4 months. All while still battling my alcohol consumption at 7 to 10 beers a night (99 calories a piece) which is 750 to 1000 calories per night.",Texxan
53,Metformin,Insulin Resistance Syndrome,7.0,,"August 3, 2011",129,I have been taking this medication for 5 years now.  It has lowered my insulin levels but they still aren't normal.  I have lost 75 pounds and my menstrual cycles has returned to normal.  I went almost a year without one at all.  I also have hypothyroidism and I think my positive results are from it. I take two 500mg pills twice a day.  I have to eat with it or else I will get sick.  ,tdl86
