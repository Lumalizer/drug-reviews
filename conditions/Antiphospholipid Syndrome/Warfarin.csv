0,Warfarin,Antiphospholipid Syndrome,5,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 26, 2016",16,"I found this today be a lifesaver, but at the same time it has cut years off what life I had. I have aged faster, have little energy to do things, my INR is not very stable, my memory is not what it once was (I used to be called a walking phonebook/dictionary by my ex), etc. Now all of these things MAY be attributed to something else, but I have my sincere doubts.",Foxglove_66
