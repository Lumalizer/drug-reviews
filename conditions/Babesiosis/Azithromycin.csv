0,Azithromycin,Babesiosis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 23, 2020",6,"It was prescribed in the hospital when I first had babesiosis. It was given in the IV. After release from hosp I believe I continued to take it for 4 more days. Whatever the complete treatment was. I had no side effects other than the usual problems with my gut biome afterwards, which I cured with yogurt and kimchi (fermented cabbage).",patriot434
1,Azithromycin,Babesiosis,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 8, 2018",7,For Lyme (babesia) and pneumonia I found Zithromax to be very effective but NOT TEVA brand manufacture. Twice that generic was utterly useless and actually on 2 separate occasions it caused me a LOT of pain/discomfort and a horrible reaction overall. Note not all genetics are alike!,Wendells
