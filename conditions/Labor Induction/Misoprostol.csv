0,Misoprostol,Labor Induction,,,"March 27, 2022",0,"My Dr gave me these pills as a way induce labor, and I wish I would of known more and known I had more options. I had two doses in about 16 hours and it didn’t ripen my cervix and it caused intense uterine contractions so close together that it  put my baby In distress.",Anonymous
1,Misoprostol,Labor Induction,6.0,,"August 9, 2021",1,"Found out my baby had no heartbeat  at 8 weeks doctor  gave me 200 mg of misoprostol took in that night went to bed woke up to use the restroom  and a huge blood clot and blood came gushing out as soon as I sat on the toilet.  I  put a pad on and soaked as soon as I started  walking. I went through  6 pads within  half-hour. I  got back in bed because  it slowed down woke up again 5 am same thing this time I was very lightheaded, it was hard for me to breathe so I checked my blood pressure and it was 70 over 60 I was still bleeding  everywhere. This is when everything  went  and I was rushed  to the back  to doctis still bleeding  with blood clots.  The  nurse gave me IV and started blood transfusion  my Doctor came checked on me said I needed d&c that the sack and fetus came out but there was still blood clots in me that needed to come out. When surgery  was over I woke up and my bleeding  was light  and I felt a lot better.  Going through  all that - I was honestly just so scared.",Miscarriage nightmare
2,Misoprostol,Labor Induction,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 6, 2021",1,I had to take this due to missed miscarriage due to foetus not developing properly at 10 weeks. Took 4 pills dissolved under tongue. Started feeling cramps 3/4 hours. I have to be honest the pain went from uncomfortable to incredibly severe and went on for around 2 hours before it eased off. Vomiting and diarrhoea. My body expelled everything from both ends relentlessly. I am still bleeding 7 hours later but the cramps are now mild like period pain. It’s horribly uncomfortable- I've never experienced pain like it but it will pass girls I promise xxx,Starpaws
3,Misoprostol,Labor Induction,1.0,,"March 14, 2021",2,"I went in for my 8 wk OB appointment, they told me I had a miscarriage at about 6 weeks. I decided to do the Misoprostyl pills.The first pills I took, caused a fever of 100 & flu like symptoms diarrhea, sweats, horrible aches, & bad pulsating cramps. No bleeding. The second dose, I started to lightly spot brown blood, the bad cramps continued.The next 12 hours, I didn't take anything else since that was my full dose. Still no bleeding. My doctor advised me to take a 3rd dose & 4th dose if I wasn't bleeding red blood, which I did. The next day, the red blood/tissue started coming out with pretty bad cramps. 12 hours after that the blood lightened but I was having a hard time peeing with burning and pelvic pain. I went to Urgent Care and it was a bladder infection, which is a side effect of the drug. A few hours after that the blood came back full force with cramps I can only describe as extreme labor like. Worst pain and experience I've had ever with a drug in my life. Highly DO NOT recommend.",Jerseygirl84
4,Misoprostol,Labor Induction,8.0,,"December 30, 2020",4,"I used these pills for a missed miscarriage at 10 weeks, the pregnancy had stopped growing around 6. Here are my tips:1. Get pain relief. I took the 4 pills and dissolved them in my cheek at around 9am. At around 10:30am I started feeling cramps. By 3:30pm each wave of intense cramps (7/10) sent me attempting birth techniques to get through the pain. I had taken two Advil before the pills and I took another 2 around 4pm but I needed something stronger.2. Use heat.Once the intense cramps started at 3:30pm I wished for a heating pad. I didn’t have one so I got into the tub. I bent over with each wave of cramps but felt more relaxed and everything started coming out in spurts.3. It will end.Be prepared to have it rough. It will end. By about 7pm I could sit on the couch and ride the waves of pain without hunching over. This morning at 6am I feel okay with menstrual-type bleeding and a mild cramping sensation. Good luck!!",MC2
5,Misoprostol,Labor Induction,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 23, 2020",8,"Took 1st pill yesterday at the clinic. Arrived home felt fine. Next day which is today, I put my other tablets in my jaw. The pain wasn't intense but I felt cramping. Clots fell out , took a shower and took 800mg  of ibuprofen. Other than than I'm good. Pain don't bother me to bad, everybody's different. I had no side affects at all.",DD
6,Misoprostol,Labor Induction,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2020",9,"I had a d&c to terminate pregnancy for health reasons at 12 weeks + 5 days. My 2 week follow up showed my body was holding onto blood and tissue on the ultrasound so was given 3 pills to take at home. I read reviews on this site which completely terrified me to take the pills, so much so that I almost fainted holding the pills in one hand and my phone in the other... I ended up waiting until the next day and took 800 mg of ibuprofen a half hour before taking the Misoprostol and barely had any cramping at all. I passed a bit of blood and had a small amount of diarrhea and after 2 hours the bleeding went down to just spotting. I had absolutely nothing to be afraid of. My periods are far worse than taking this medication. Don’t be afraid to take this medication to pass incomplete abortion. It’s not as bad as everyone is saying!",Vanessa
7,Misoprostol,Labor Induction,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 9, 2020",18,"I took the pill 2/8/2020 I was 8 weeks pregnant and the doctor didn’t find a heart beat so confirmed my baby wasn't alive, they sent this pill to the pharmacy so I read the reviews before I took the pill and it made me so nervous I kept pushing back to take it because the reviews make me think it’s a horrible pain your going to feel (negative for me).  They said it’s labor pains DO NOT READ THE REVIEWS - JUST DO IT. Because once I took them the pain was MINOR CRAMPS I slept through it all when I woke up it was period cramps that’s it.  I had  nothing to make you feel like you need heavy drugs, remember everyone is different. Once I  took it just fall asleep, you’re will be okay the cramps lasted 20 minutes the bleeding is still here but no uncomfortable pain or anything If you have to take this pill you got this stay strong. I didn’t take any drugs they prescribed me Vicodin  and I didn’t even need that medicine.  When I woke up ate drunk water plenty of water and watched TV.",Nicolelove

9,Misoprostol,Labor Induction,5.0,,"January 10, 2020",17,"At 8 weeks we went in for our scan and unfortunately there was no heart beat. My doctor told me to take this medicine or D&C. I picked this drug because I wanted to be at home when the tissue passed. I took tramadol 50mg and ibuprofen 600 1 hour before starting the misoprostol pills. Within 30 minutes started bleeding lots of clots. Was fine until maybe 2.5 hour after taking medicine. It was honestly the worst pain I have ever had. I had vomiting, sweats, shakiness and extremely painful cramps. I was in so much pain I started making so much noise that the lady in the condo beside me came to see what was happening. If I knew I would have had so much pain I would have had a D&C. However, after about 6 hours after taking pills the pain started to calm down. I found that once all the clots and placenta came out the pain started to go away and just turned into a heavy period. If you are taking it for the same reason I did I pray you don’t have the same experience I did. I am very sorry for your loss :( ❤️",Holly
10,Misoprostol,Labor Induction,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 16, 2019",11,"Just a note for women reading these reviews...using this for an abortion in early pregnancy is VASTLY different than using it for a missed miscarriage further along. Which is why people think it’s a bad period at 6 weeks vs feeling like natural labor. I was prescribed this to to help me remove remaining tissue after a 13 week miscarriage. I had already passed the baby and placenta naturally but had remaining tissue. The ER sent me home with cytotec and no meds. It was the worst pain of my life. It was worst than the miscarriage portion. The contractions went non stop so I didn’t have any time to properly breathe or regain control. I was shaking, sweating, moaning and losing tons of blood. It was the worst experience. When I saw my OB that next week, he ended up telling me that it is like full term labor at this point. Horrible!",B
11,Misoprostol,Labor Induction,10.0,,"December 3, 2019",1,"I had a natural miscarriage at 10 weeks and took this to get rid of the products of conception. The first time I took it I had mild cramping and diarrhea for a day but didn't work. The second time I took it, about 2 weeks later, also vaginally, it did work. I took it Friday night and had mild cramping and diarrhea. The SEVERE cramping started at noon on Saturday and lasted about 5 hours. It would come every few minutes like with labor contractions. It was the most painful thing I've experienced. I was also throwing up, which I think actually helped push everything out. I passed a lot of big clots. Monday the severe cramping started again. I thought I was dying and almost called 911. I was throwing up again. I passed the placenta after about an hour. Immediately after that the cramps stopped. That was yesterday, I'm still bleeding lightly. If you are far enough along I recommend getting those women's diapers/padded underwear. A maxi pad would not have been enough in my case.",Linz
12,Misoprostol,Labor Induction,8.0,,"May 4, 2015",8,I lost a baby and they gave me these to expell the pregnancy I was hurt but than to find out I had to pay out of pocket made me feel worse like even though there was no heart beat at 12 weeks and only measuring 6 it really hurt to think I was paying 13 .00 to loose my child it made me contract about 30 min after taking the fist set I was in pain just like having one of my other children just at the end of this I wouldnt have a baby . I lost more blood than I ever seen in my life and bleed for a month after my peorids that was ALWAYS regular are every where after 10 months so ....if you get this expect labor,roxymomof3an4
