1,Oxytocin,Labor Induction,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 10, 2021",5,Pitocin (oxytocin):This drug was dangerous to me and my baby. My baby was born not breathing but they saved her. I was readmitted to the hospital with postpartum preeclampsia a day after they sent me home. I was so bad that I was admitted to the ICU. I lost 30 pounds in fluids after the magnesium. I was so swollen I could barely walk. I will never take this drug again. Please don’t get induced unless it is a life threatening situation.,Ashleigh
2,Oxytocin,Labor Induction,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 11, 2020",2,Pitocin (oxytocin):I had a wonderful experience on pitocin. No side effects and labor pains were manageable. Hoping to be induced again this time!,Anonymous
3,Oxytocin,Labor Induction,1.0,,"February 2, 2020",16,"Pitocin (oxytocin):I was a low risk mom that has long labors, but pushed into Pitocin. 11 hours on Pitocin while I told them that they were not stopping, I begged for an epidural. I’m certain that the monitors missed the distress my daughter was in while the staff just kept treating me like a drama queen as I told them repeatedly that I was dying. Eliza was vacuumed out of me. She was born with low oxygen and blood levels and they could not resuscitate her. The Pitocin literally squeezed her to death. She passed away three hours later. I was told that she must’ve had a heart defect that was missed despite the fact that I knew it was the labor drugs. I could barely handle it, so how could she?!? A week later, I was readmitted for postpartum preeclampsia, but I was a walking water balloon. I lost 11 pounds of fluids in 24 hours on magnesium. It took three people to draw my blood. I am sure that it was water toxicity and a side affect of the Pitocin. I’m probably lucky to have survived myself.",Kate

7,Oxytocin,Labor Induction,,,"October 28, 2013",19,"My pitocin induced child has bipolar disorder. He began showing signs as early as 3 . When I hear of other children with same symptoms, I ask and my own unofficial study shows each and every mother had pitocin at some point in pregnancy.  Some ADHD some defiant disorder some bipolar and many with bizarre behavior as yet undiagnosed",Jana.
