0,Imuran,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,1,,"April 29, 2019",18,"Shortly after commencing Imuran at a low dose (50mg/day) I developed a severe & persistent headache and also felt very tired and listless. One week later everything got a lot worse: within 24 hours of commencing the higher dosage (100mg/day) I began to feel extremely nauseous, and about a hour later non-stop vomiting commenced.  I couldn't even swallow a mouthful of water without bringing it up almost immediately.  That night all the joints in my body began to swell up and become very painful.  By 3am I could barely walk, and by 7am my husband had to call in emergency services: my BP had dropped to 56/40, so I was immediately taken to hospital where I was treated with copious amounts of IV fluids, anti-emetics and high doses of corticosteroids. Over the next few days I very gradually began to improve & was discharged from hospital 6 days later, but it took many weeks before I was anywhere near back to normal.",christie07
