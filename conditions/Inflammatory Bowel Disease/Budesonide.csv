0,Budesonide,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 18, 2021",1,"Entocort EC (budesonide):I've had stomach and intestinal issues for many, many years and have sporadically been using Entocort over 10 years.  I'm sensitive to most medication and don't take it daily as it has side effects (i.e. vision & bone density issues).  There have times when the gastroenterologist prescribed it everyday for about 4 weeks, tapering off after that time frame.  Although, I wish I didn't have to take this steroid, it is the only medication which helps, even if for short periods.  I'm amazed there is no cure for these debilitating intestinal diseases.",Jo-Ann
1,Budesonide,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 16, 2021",0,"Taken this 3 times over the course of 3 years  as well as Entocort and Predinsolone each one for several months. I found this does work for the first week or two but then gets less effective and my symptoms come back with a vengeance after that time. Also noticed that on all 3 my levels continued to rise in stool tests despite colonoscopy showing nothing visual so I would say it can work but not in all cases. Side effects of the first two drugs were a weakened immune system, tiredness and headaches in the later cycles.",Tummy pain

Suffered for 10 years with chronic diarrhea and stomach pain, after 1st dose felt much better and progressively got better during 8 week course of treatment. My symptoms came back a couple of days after completing the medication, so doctor prescribed 2nd round. Just finished 2nd round and can feel myself reverting back, waking up with  stomach pain and diarrhea again. Waiting for doctor to see what he recommends going forward, can't imagine taking a steroid for the rest of my life.",Lisa Lopez

Second day of use of three  3mg  tablets I was no longer experiencing incontinence  with the bowel and things were getting back to normal. 10 weeks later after being off of medicine for 5 days...my colon started acting up again.

Last week I forgot to take my dose in the morning and after dinner that evening my diarrhea had returned in full ugly force. It wasn't until my husband asked if I took my med that I realized I had forgotten to take that morning. This was the only time throughout the course that I missed a does. This med has worked wonderfully so far with no side effects, however I am concerned that in two weeks I am scheduled to stop taking it or to ween off that it won't be successful. My understanding is long term steroid use is harmful. Any advice?",Curious

17,Budesonide,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 12, 2017",38,"I suffered from massive diarrhea and horrible incontinence that kept me hiding at home, deeply depressed and wearing a diaper.Budesonide changed my life!  I travel now and go everywhere with confidence. The bad news is that the American pharma industry has jacked up the cost of GENERIC Budesonide to over $1,000 a month ( without insurance.) Even WITH my United Healthcare insurance, the cost is STILL$300 a month! Luckily, I found a Canadian website which sells drugs from Europe and India, so now my cost for 30 days of Budesonide is $125. Check Consumer Reports for guidelines about how to safely purchase meds from Canada. Meanwhile, tell your Congress person that the U.S. Pharma industry is BLEEDING us!",Colitis Queen

19,Budesonide,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,10.0,,"June 16, 2015",73,"Budesonide has been a blessing in my case and other than being extremely expensive, I am pleased. I have now been on it for 2 months due to collagenous colitis and have had a bonus experience other than controlling my diarrhea, I also suffer from extreme arthritis pain. Within days both the Diarrhea and the Pain were 95% gone. I am extremely concerned about being weaned off budesonide at 12 weeks which is the prescribed course.  Also curious as to others that have possibly been on it longer and also whether anyone else has experienced the bonus pain relief. I feel like I actually have my Life back right now due to this stuff.",Anonymous

I was in agony a week ago with a flare up but this saved me.  I'm supposed to be on it for Six weeks - then off. Scared about that.

I suffered with chronic diarrhea for over a year and had tried Imodium, dietary changes, and anything else I could think of to stop it. I eventually had a colonoscopy and biopsies taken showed collagenous colitis, a form of microscopic colitis. ONE day on this med stopped my diarrhea.

The one thing I found is the generic Budesonide (bright pink capsule) does not work well as the brand Entocort EC. (gray and pink) I take whatever the pharmacy has available. This last refill was generic and while on it, all my symptoms returned. Saw my gastro and told him about it and he said he had one other patient that stated generic didn't work for them. He prescribed brand only and it works like a charm. If you find you aren't doing well on the generic, ask for brand. See if it makes a difference. It did for me.",SherylR
