0,Pentasa,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 11, 2021",1,"I've had IBD for around 5-6 years now, which most of that time I have been using Pentasa. Before, my stomach pain was really bad but it's seem to have calmed down now with medicine. I take 4 capsules /day. (2 @ morning, 2 @ night) I've not had any symptoms since I started using Pentasa. I burp a lot, but that's really the only side effect I have.",Gryffon
1,Pentasa,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 4, 2021",1,"Pro: It kind of worked, a bit. My bloodwork improved and the mildest part of the inflammation went away.Cons: It didn't work enough. The area of more severe inflammation hasn't budged, unfortunately, and I'm still having bad stomach cramps every day. I tried upping my dose from 2 grams to 4 grams and that actually made my symptoms worse, so I went back down. I'm also losing a lot of hair, but it's not really noticeable to anyone else, and I will say that that's the only side effect I've had from this medication on a 1-2 grams dosage, which I think is pretty good.If your doctor tells you to take this medication, definitely take it! I wish it had worked for me. It does work for a lot of people. I would be happy to take this medication every day for the rest of my life if it only worked!",Sandy
2,Pentasa,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 25, 2019",4,Pentasa was so helpful for IBS It allowed me to get off steroids. I always felt better after taking it. Having to take it only twice a day was very comfortable.,Anonymous
3,Pentasa,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 15, 2015",10,"This is the first drug I was prescribed after hospitalization and initial diagnosis.  It made it possible to get off steroids and back to work.  Hair loss was extensive, until I increased water intake and saw a renal dietician.  Even though I am allergic to Sulfa drugs, this has been the least risky of the medications prescribed for my condition.  My hair has grown back in, and with lifestyle changes I am much better.  Long term, this is the only regimen that works for me.",Psych11
