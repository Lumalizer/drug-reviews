0,Lialda,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,4,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 27, 2020",4,"Went through a few frightening episodes of what I thought was lots of blood in urine. Had a ridiculously long and frightful work-up (cultures, cystoscopy with dye under general anesthesia) to rule out infection and cancer. Nothing was ever found. Happened again 2 years later. This time, my husband recommended that we search the medical literature before going down the rabbit hole again. Thereâ€™s a single report of mesalamine (active ingredient of Lialda) reacting with bleach to form a reddish-brown dye. Upshot: a fresh toilet cleaning bleach tablet had been added to the water closet the day before.",MoreKnowledgableNow
