0,Mesalamine,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 11, 2021",1,"Pentasa (mesalamine):I've had IBD for around 5-6 years now, which most of that time I have been using Pentasa. Before, my stomach pain was really bad but it's seem to have calmed down now with medicine. I take 4 capsules /day. (2 @ morning, 2 @ night) I've not had any symptoms since I started using Pentasa. I burp a lot, but that's really the only side effect I have.",Gryffon
1,Mesalamine,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 4, 2021",1,"Pentasa (mesalamine):Pro: It kind of worked, a bit. My bloodwork improved and the mildest part of the inflammation went away.Cons: It didn't work enough. The area of more severe inflammation hasn't budged, unfortunately, and I'm still having bad stomach cramps every day. I tried upping my dose from 2 grams to 4 grams and that actually made my symptoms worse, so I went back down. I'm also losing a lot of hair, but it's not really noticeable to anyone else, and I will say that that's the only side effect I've had from this medication on a 1-2 grams dosage, which I think is pretty good.If your doctor tells you to take this medication, definitely take it! I wish it had worked for me. It does work for a lot of people. I would be happy to take this medication every day for the rest of my life if it only worked!",Sandy
2,Mesalamine,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 25, 2021",0,I was on this medicine for about 2 weeks. It wasn't helping so my doc said I could get off it. A few days later I had terrible chest pain and assumed it was an ulcer. It got so bad I went to the ER at 4am and after some blood tests was told it was myocarditis (heart inflammation) which is a more rare side effect of the drug. I had no other side effects so just keep an eye on chest pain and go in if you get it. I was treated and released and totally fine after. Not the end of the world just wish I would have known to watch for that as a side effect.,Fifster920
3,Mesalamine,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,4.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 27, 2020",4,"Lialda (mesalamine):Went through a few frightening episodes of what I thought was lots of blood in urine. Had a ridiculously long and frightful work-up (cultures, cystoscopy with dye under general anesthesia) to rule out infection and cancer. Nothing was ever found. Happened again 2 years later. This time, my husband recommended that we search the medical literature before going down the rabbit hole again. Thereâ€™s a single report of mesalamine (active ingredient of Lialda) reacting with bleach to form a reddish-brown dye. Upshot: a fresh toilet cleaning bleach tablet had been added to the water closet the day before.",MoreKnowledgableNow
4,Mesalamine,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,10.0,,"February 4, 2020",4,"I am 64-had a colonoscopy last July for a positive Cologuard test result. No cancer, but, there was a small area of redness the doctor was concerned about. Ordered a CT scan-no def results. After exam, did not have a normal bowel movement-I was perfectly fine before the exam. By late Aug, had serious rectal bleeding, loose stool. Went back in mid-Sept they ordered tests for infection/parasities- were negative. In Nov I reached the worst point, where I was running to the bathroom almost hourly. I started taking probiotics, based on the recommendation of a friend and that helped. By late Dec, started having somewhat solid stool again. I had an appointment with a gastroenterologist at the end of January-at that point I was recovering quite nicely and she prescribed Mesalamine, which I have been taking for two weeks now and I am practically back to normal. I don't know exactly why I began to recover on my own, but, probiotics definitely help and the Mesalamine sealed the deal.",Mr. Big

8,Mesalamine,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 3, 2018",11,"Apriso (mesalamine):Apriso worked well to control the inflammation in my stomach and small intestine. However after a few weeks of use, it made my hair fall out. If I liked wigs this would be great. So far nothing else has worked this good.",Trying to get Relief

11,Mesalamine,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 15, 2015",10,"Pentasa (mesalamine):This is the first drug I was prescribed after hospitalization and initial diagnosis.  It made it possible to get off steroids and back to work.  Hair loss was extensive, until I increased water intake and saw a renal dietician.  Even though I am allergic to Sulfa drugs, this has been the least risky of the medications prescribed for my condition.  My hair has grown back in, and with lifestyle changes I am much better.  Long term, this is the only regimen that works for me.",Psych11
