0,Azathioprine,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,1,,"April 29, 2019",18,"Imuran (azathioprine):Shortly after commencing Imuran at a low dose (50mg/day) I developed a severe & persistent headache and also felt very tired and listless. One week later everything got a lot worse: within 24 hours of commencing the higher dosage (100mg/day) I began to feel extremely nauseous, and about a hour later non-stop vomiting commenced.  I couldn't even swallow a mouthful of water without bringing it up almost immediately.  That night all the joints in my body began to swell up and become very painful.  By 3am I could barely walk, and by 7am my husband had to call in emergency services: my BP had dropped to 56/40, so I was immediately taken to hospital where I was treated with copious amounts of IV fluids, anti-emetics and high doses of corticosteroids. Over the next few days I very gradually began to improve & was discharged from hospital 6 days later, but it took many weeks before I was anywhere near back to normal.",christie07
1,Azathioprine,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 15, 2018",2,"I have Crohn's, but it is in my small intestine (not terminal ileum this time) and worse in my mouth.  Most of the drugs used (except steroids which can only be used for a short period of time) are mainly for the terminal ileum and colon and therefore do nothing for my problem.  Worse Entyvio didn't help and made the mouth ulcers significantly worse to the point being unable to brush my teeth, eat almost anything and was eating away at my gums & cheeks.  Azathioprine has been the solution, that has kept the mouth ulcers at bay.",June B
