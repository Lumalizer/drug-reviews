0,Doxepin,Neuropathic Pain,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 29, 2021",3,"I've had non-stop itching with no rash for over a year.  Been thru all sorts of antihistamines,  cortisone shots, prednisone,  special formulary creams and pills, but nothing worked until I started Doxepin.  To be fair, I've only been on it a week along with a new cream and 90% of the incessant itch is gone!  I've finally had a good nights sleep. Only downside is how sleepy it makes me, especially since I'm on a twice a day regimen.  Hopefully that will subside. But I'm loving not itching!!",Itchygirl
1,Doxepin,Neuropathic Pain,4,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 20, 2019",13,"Craving for sweets but otherwise no appetite. Increased dry mouth, sore and bleeding gums, vivid dreams, brain fog the next day. I was given Silenor because I wake up every 2 hours. While I sleep, Iâ€™m told I thrash about, seize my leg muscles, and very loud and verbal during sleep. Even though I still wake every 2 hours, half the time I go back to sleep for an hour. Still only getting about four hours but not in a row.",Trink
