My pain came back and then a light bulb came on 2 yrs later that it probably blocked my pain as I had pain so bad for the last two years.Muscle hurts so bad. Headaches cant get out of bed.  Started 150 mg at night with 4 days I felt better. It takes 4 weeks to take full effect I heard.Very pleased,Jc
2,Oxcarbazepine,Neuropathic Pain,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 17, 2018",44,I’ve tried many prescriptions for foot neuropathy with hardly any relief.  Neither Lyrica nor a very high dose gabepentin worked. Oxcarbazepine does work for neuropathic pain!! I’ve been on 150mgX3 daily for over a year and it given me relief like I haven’t had in years!,Hollywood
3,Oxcarbazepine,Neuropathic Pain,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 9, 2018",31,I have suffered for years from migraines and neuropathy pain. This medication has relieved my pain and I am grateful. I take 300 mg twice a day and have gained a few pounds but it’s worth it. I am able to function without constant pain now.,Jill
4,Oxcarbazepine,Neuropathic Pain,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 16, 2018",33,"I tried several different drugs for the neuropathy pain in my feet. The pain was so bad I couldn’t sleep, walk or even just sit on the couch with my feet up without major pain meds.  Oxcarbazepine is the only drug that made it get better and took away the excruciating pain. I’m so thankful for it. Truly amazing!",Hollywood
5,Oxcarbazepine,Neuropathic Pain,8,,"July 1, 2017",28,I have a problem with neuropathic pain due to nerve scarring at L5S1.  I take  Tramadol as the primary pain reliever but I have also been using Oxcarbazepine.  It seems to have more of a long term impact on reducing pain for me.   In other words I have to take it for about a week to see an improvement and if I stop taking it the pain takes about a week to return.  I take 2-150mg tablets.  I have observed no side effects.  I have been taking these drugs for some 15 years.  I always have some level of pain but these 2 drugs have made it possible to have a mostly normal life not otherwise possible.,mrsciatic
6,Oxcarbazepine,Neuropathic Pain,7,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 30, 2016",19,"64M-Taken for several years for severe foot and leg pains, not diabetic. Not 100% relief but allowed daily functions most days. Took Tramadol to get sleep occasionally. Tried Lyrica with side effects so bad have gone back to oxcarbazipine. Sleeping more, daytime drowsy but Lyrica effects are disappearing after seven days",neuro tom
7,Oxcarbazepine,Neuropathic Pain,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 21, 2016",21,"I am taking Trileptal to help reduce nerve sensitivity for my chronic pain in my neck and lower back due to degenerative disc disease. It has reduced some of my chronic pain, but it makes me sleepy and tired all the time. I don't know which is the lesser of the 2 evils, pain or sleepiness and tiresome. I started on 75 mg at night and gradually worked up to taking 150 mg twice a day. I reduced it back to 150 at night and 75 mg in the morning so I won't be as sleepy but that doesn't seem to help any. I go back to the Dr next week and I will discuss it with him. more.",Anonymous
8,Oxcarbazepine,Neuropathic Pain,8,,"April 1, 2013",30,"I have suffered low back pain from spondylolisthesis with peripheral neuropathy for 40 years, neck pain from damaged disks at C5-C6 and C2-C3 for 20 and 10 years respectively.  Each center of pain radiates outward locally and peripherally.  After ALL the qualifying trials-oral meds, tigger point injections, epidural steroid injections, and rhizotomies- failed to provide adequate relief, an intrathecal pain pump implanted constantly delivering DILAUDID and BUPIVOCAINE to my spinal canal, which has worked well with some caveats.  Raising pump rate enough to bring pain < 3 on 1-10 scale creates too much sedation to function and disrupts sleep-wake cycles.  Adding oral Trileptil has shown substantial pain reduction with no side effects noted.",JessieD
