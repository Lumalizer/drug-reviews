1,Lyrica,Neuropathic Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 24, 2022",2,"I was on it for 4 days, started with one pill at night.  By day 2 I started noticing my cravings for food were picking up by day 4 I was all out bingeing on EVERYTHING I could eat!  Day 4 I had gained 4 lbs and the heaviest I have ever been, up a whole pants size.  Mostly in my lower legs and feet. I stopped the drug at that point.  I noticed a bit of dry mouth and was drinking more water but actually more along the lines of what I should be drinking, no other symptoms.   I am already dealing with the fall out from the weight gain related to all the biologics, prednisone, dmards etc from the last two years of trials.  This just pushed me over the edge and I said enough.  I loath being this heavy.It did nothing for the pain but I do recognize I was not on it long enough.  I made more progress going to the chiropractor and the low glutamate diet. I am just horrible with the self-control needed for diets.",Daniellesdrugchecker
2,Lyrica,Neuropathic Pain,4.0,,"January 20, 2022",2,"I took Lyrica for nerve pain in my legs. The pain was so bed I had no choice. This is the worst medication I've ever taken and couldn't wait to get off of it. I was lucky to find a Chiropractor to help me with my pain and after being on the medication for 4 months I was ready to come off of it. While the medication helped with my pain it unfortunately mad me feel like a zombie and gain 15 pounds. It made me clumsy and I couldn't think right because of the brain fog. I had to taper off of the 225mg that I was taking. After taking the last pill I had extreme agitation, headaches, nausea, diarrhea really bad and this lasted 6 days. I will never take this awful medication again.",Molly
3,Lyrica,Neuropathic Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 17, 2021",2,"I've been burning for 5 years. I went through many tests and many doctors. I lost my cool with my last doctor because I was tired of being ignored and given zero pain killers. It's ruined my credit and my life and I needed something to try and get my life back. I saw a new doctor a week ago. He too, refused to give me anything. However, he was shocked no one prescribed me lyrica because most of my symptoms align with nerve damage. I know this medication has a lot of negative reviews. It seems it's a love/dislike medication. Either it works miracles or it's horrifyingly bad. I'm one of the people that was helped with this medication. It reduced my body-wide burning by 90%. I'm not back to feeling normal but I feel sooooooo much better. I was on the edge there for the last couple months. Life was looking less and less appetizing. Thank you lyrica for existing. I've had zero side effects so far.  9.5/10",John H
4,Lyrica,Neuropathic Pain,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 6, 2021",2,Lyrica works fast and is great for making me able to move and function normally in the mornings... I had back surgery an L5/6 discectomy and s1 root clearance several years ago.The problem is that my Gps surgery will only prescribe generic pregabalin which is not   effective. To get Lyrica I have to travel to a pharmacy several miles away.  i don't understand this but Lyrica is the only one that works.,amaggie

I was prescribed Lyrica and noticed a dramatic difference in my pain, tingles, and other somatic symptoms. I had to find my right dosage which wound up being 450 mg, but I do not experience any lethargy, head fog, and it really works in calming my nerves.

6,Lyrica,Neuropathic Pain,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 3, 2021",2,"It's been working great for me so far.  I tried gabapentin and found the irritability, hostility and memory loss a major problem.  Halfway through sentences I was forgetting the word I wanted, and it was impacting my work.  I went another 2-3 years in constant pain, afraid to try Lyrica.  I wish I hadn't waited.  I have cervical and lumbar stenosis, arthritis and nerve impingement from bulging disks.  I can actually work a shift now without pain, I'm not awake all through the night feeling like fire is trickling all over me.  I'm taking 100mg morning, 50 mid day and 50 before bed.

8,Lyrica,Neuropathic Pain,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 20, 2021",2,"Lyrica did work for my neuropathy pain.  But it had side affects on me:  #1 Severe constipation and loss of the sensation that alerted me to have BM.  It was just horrible.  #2 Severe dry mouth to the point it was difficult to talk because my tongue would stick to the roof of my mouth. #3 I'd wake up with a slimy mouth every morning that was very bitter and my lips would have a rough, dry residue on them.  #4 When I went to bed, I'd be out for 10, 12, 14 hours.",shockeedoc
9,Lyrica,Neuropathic Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 14, 2021",2,I was put on 50mg 3x daily for CRPS caused after ACL surgery. I was fully able to do PT but still had nerve pain. My doctor increased slowly to 100mg 3x a day. I noticed within 3 months I gained 30 pounds. My period stopped all together. I had horrible brain fog. Very bad dry mouth. Headache.  I noticed after two weeks of taking the 100mg 3x daily that I started swelling in my legs and hands. My feet and hands became very painful and swollen. And my nerve pain seemed to get way worse. My ACL knee started to swell and become very stiff and hurt. I stopped taking this medicine literally 3 days ago and started taking CBD (I thought this stuff was a joke) but it has helped my intense electrical nerve pain through my whole body. And has helped the pain in my hands and feet. Waiting to see if the swelling and other issues go away once it’s completely out of my system. This medication had horrible side effects on my body just hoping I can reverse it!!,Windy

I have tested it by weaning off and on and the thoughts go away when I decrease dosage which is 600mg max per day. I am fully conscious of these thoughts and am able to deal with them, however they are strong and anyone new to Lyrica (pregabalin) should take strong caution when taking this medication.

17,Lyrica,Neuropathic Pain,1.0,,"March 9, 2021",115,Taking lyrica for almost 2 weeks now at 50mg 3x per day and have had no change in how much pain I’m in. Doctor prescribed this without even looking at me. The side effects are so intense and there are too many drug interactions that come along with it. I have had the worst brain fog and I forget the most simple words and you lose the ability to speak properly. Always drowsy and dizzy and the feeling of being drunk or high. More pain is also a side effect I seem to have. Definitely would not recommend this drug to anyone.,Anny

My oncologist really in my opinion didn’t give me hardly any options as far as the pain relief goes SO I went to a pain management doctor and I started on Lyrica ( pregabalin).

53,Lyrica,Neuropathic Pain,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 7, 2019",82,"Beware of this drug. I’ve taken it for over 12 years now as have been tapering off it for well over a year and a half. Withdrawal from this drug is / can be a life altering, career destroying experience. The anxiety and depression can be extreme. Horrible brain fog, severe insomnia, paranoia, severe mood swings and anger that approaches rage. My research indicates that severe withdrawal is fairly uncommon but there is no way to know if you’ll be a victim. And the after effects can last for years trying the patience of loved ones, your employer, doctors and friends. If you are considering going on Lyrica or on it for only a short time, consider stopping as soon as you can. But beware - even short term exposure can lead to nasty, long lasting withdrawals. I’ve read one persons account of only taking it for two weeks and she still spent a year in withdrawal.",Sneaky Pete

98,Lyrica,Neuropathic Pain,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 7, 2018",46,"Lyrica is very effective for the radiculopathy (nerve pain that radiates into the lower extremities) I suffer as a result of multiple back issues. The key to minimizing side effects is to start on the lowest dose possible. I've noticed many doctors start at the max or even higher, even if you're new to the medicine. This is why so many people have so many side effects. I have few if any side effects and it's the only thing that works for my leg pain. I could barely sit without it, the pain was unbelievable. Now it's manageable. If this medicine is something you and your doctor are considering, ask to start at the lowest dose and only increase it if you're not getting relief. Many of the posters I see here with severe side effects are on 300-600mg a day when the max recommended dose is 300mg a day. Of course I don't blame patients for not knowing this. They should be able to trust their doctor. This medication can be so very helpful if used and prescribed correctly.",RNinpain

I have a pinched nerve in my lower back (L5) that caused me so much sciatic pain in my left leg. It was difficult to sit/drive and I have a sit-down job. I 1st took gabapentin 600mg 3 times a day with no relief at all. I have been taking 50mg of lyrica 2 x's a day for about a month now and the pain has been greatly reduced. I noticed an improvement after 1-2 weeks. It has to build up in your system. The only downside that I've noticed so far, other than the price, is drowsiness and forgetfulness. After insurance, I have to pay $108/month. To me, it's worth the reduction of pain. I hope they come up with a generic version soon. I highly recommend you try it if nothing else helps.",Barb

The doctor had me on it for over 3 years with no problems, then my insurance refuses to pay for it now, because a 30 day supply is $900.00. They wanted to give me Neurontin, which I am allergic too. Now all the nerve pain is back and worse. I want the Lyrica back and would recommend it to any one.",trinapettry
250,Lyrica,Neuropathic Pain,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 16, 2013",107,"I have been on Lyrica for about three weeks and I feel that my experience may help. I have chronic nerve damage in my arm and sympathetic nerve damage. If you are about to begin the Lyrica ride expect the following. You will be living in a cloud. I noticed a few reviews explained it as that, and I feel they hit the nail on the head. You literally feel drunk. ",Im Handsome
251,Lyrica,Neuropathic Pain,,,"May 24, 2013",84,"I've had multiple spinal surgeries, and have been on methadone for about 5 years.  Additionally, I've had issues with anxiety, depression, mood stability, and just being miserable most of the time.  I also recently learned that I have thoracic outlet syndrome.  Lyrica helped immediately with all of my pain; with the numbness from thoracic outlet syndrome, and it has a surprisingly positive psychological effect.  Due to other meds, or psychological issues, I have trouble focusing, making decisions, carrying on conversation, and moving forward with decisions.  Lyrica somehow makes all these issues just go away.  It also makes my tinnitus (ringing in the ears) much less annoying.  BUT...I had to stop taking due to side effects, fatigue.",Dan Quayle
252,Lyrica,Neuropathic Pain,6.0,,"May 23, 2013",73,"I have been on Lyrica for only a few months for neuropathy pains. I also have lupus, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and gastrointestinal issues. Lyrica worked excellent the first few weeks for the neuropathic pains. After a while I noticed I started to have more lupus flares and joint irritations. It is causing me to gain weight which is a plus because my other medicines was causing me to loose weight. I have tried a lot of medication including gabapentin (3600mg daily) and Lyrica worked best overall.",Gen116

254,Lyrica,Neuropathic Pain,9.0,,"March 30, 2013",93,"I started taking Lyrica for pain from Hashimoto's disease. At first I had a lot of energy. Then, I leveled off and the fatigue is back. The pain is about 85% gone! I did experience a huge emotional roller coaster at first and even had suicidal thoughts for the first time ever. I figured it was just the adjustment period and gave it more time. It has been about 2 months now and I just wish I could figure out if it is the Lyrica causing the fatigue.  I ache too much without it to test the theory.",TTTTTYYYYY
