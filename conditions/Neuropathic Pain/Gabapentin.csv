Cannot understand about all of the bad reviews…I am the poster girl for severe chronic neuropathic pain. Head to toe burning pain for three years. Lower body legs and back is the worst, caused by trapped nerves in the SI Joint after motorbike accident + extreme trauma….it ruined my life. Endless suicide attempts. Psych hospital stays. Screaming continually thrashing around in pain. Morphine didn’t help, no painkillers worked, even weed. Endless physio to no avail. I am on the lowest dose of this drug, 100mg x3 a day. Pain was 100% where I was being sick from it, sleep deprived. Pain is now at 40%, can’t imagine what it will be if I increase dose! Also have severe OCD and bipolar and panic disorder.

I am in constant pain with right leg which has lost a lot of power and I now cannot walk on my own.  I use a Rollator or crutches.  I have been on Gabapentin for  about a year 300 mg a day.   It helps with pain though I have to take five co-codamol as well each day.  I suffer urinary tract infections twice a year but now this is getting worse and I do feel Gabapentin is to blame as the side  effects are  increased urinary trouble.  I would like to stop Gabapentin.  I don't want another nerve pill as they all have bad side effects.  I am wondering would morphine and paracetamol be better.

The withdrawal from Gabapentin made me suicidal and I ended up Baker Acted here in FL.  But, it doesn't end there because since I live in FL and was Baker Acted because of the medication, now each time I go to the ER for a physical medical problem, the ER wants to talk about my ""mental health"" instead of the blood coming from my body or broken bone I went to the ER for. So now, I am in the process of selling my home and my business so I can leave the State of Florida because years later, someone phoned in a fraudulent tip that I was suicidal and despite proof that the tip was bogus, I was taken by force and denied my blood pressure medication by a state-run facility for three days until I collapsed from hypertension.

I then went through a Steroidal Epideral injection (equally expensive) which didn't help at all. My GP Dr. prescribed 300 mg three times daily while I'm debating full back surgery and I have to say that the Gabapentin has provided almost full pain relief that I haven't had in the last 2 years!

I never took this drug before surgery, but they prescribed this drug when I was discharge after surgery.  After three days of taking this, I started feeling worse than before my surgery.  My back pain was horrible, plus pain down both legs!  It had a paradoxical effect and caused nerve pain to increase and spread.  We were all confused as to what was going on with me, but the only thing different I had done was to start taking this drug.  So my Doctor told me to stop immediately and within 2 days, the horrible pain stopped and the only pain I had was normal post surgical pain!  Doctors, please stop prescribing this as standard procedure post surgery, PLEASE!  I have heard the same story over and over (patients develop full body nerve pain after several days on the drug).

I wanted to thank everyone here who shared their experiences, as it helped me to take a risk with gabapentin.  I used 2 pills of Amoxicillin of 875 mg each and it caused tremendous pain all over my body for 1 month.  I did not know I was allergic to amoxicillin. No one knew how to alleviate my pain on level 15 out of 10.  I experienced radiating nerve pain on my arms and legs as well as scalp, and my back.  My allergist suggested to take prednisone but after 4 days it did not help at all.  I am a 5’1 person and weighed 152 pounds.  Allegra and Claritin did not help.  After excruciating pain for 6 days, I took 100mg of gabapentin although my allergist prescribed 300mg the 1st day, and 600mg next, and 900mg next.  I immediately felt alleviation of nerve pain! I had to increase the dose.  The side effects are drowsiness; it’s needed to recover as nothing else was wrong in my body.

I highly recommend this med if you have tried others like I have and are still in a lot of pain. I do still need my regular pain med; thankfully I can take less of it.There is one dangerous side effect of gabapentin-and that is why I am writing this Review. For me, it exacerbates sadness and feelings of despair and hopelessness - it causes irritability. I am dealing with these issues already and this med makes it worse. The only reason to take this is if you are in debilitating pain - as in cannot get up and walk and need it. I am aware of these other effects and trying to exercise - because it helps A LOT :) I make it a point to be sure and exercise everyday to dissipate these feelings. I will take this as long as I can.

The recall became more and more sketchy, until I had no choice but to cease the Rx. My Dr weaned me off of the meds to confirm that it’s actually the cause of my recent issues. I’m going for a followup appointment in 2 days but I can say with certainty that I feel as if a fog has lifted. I was also experiencing sharp acute pains in my head.

The Neurontin effectively reduced the pain in my back; however, the mental side effects were not worth the pain reduction.  I have been previously diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but those illnesses were under control with an anti-depressant.  However, once I started using Neurontin, my depression and anxiety came back with a vengeance.  I had an anxiety attack and could not control my mood.  I was tapered off of the drug immediately and I was back to my old self.
