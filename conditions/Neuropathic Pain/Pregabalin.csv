6,Pregabalin,Neuropathic Pain,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 9, 2022",0,I had a pinched sciatic nerve at L5 S1 in 2021.  The problem was caused by disc degeneration and stenosis.  I was put on Oxycodone and Pregabalin for the nerve pain in my foot.  My foot was having bouts of shooting severe shooting electrical type pain as well as a feeling of a burn on the top of my foot.  I also suffered from drop foot when I walked.  I was on Oxycodone first for about a month and then Pregabalin.  The Pregabalin appeared to help with the shooting pains.  I could feel them coming on like before but they hardly ever seemed to fire off like before.  It did not help much with the constant burning sensation on my skin.  A month or so after surgery my drop foot started to disappear.  The intense shooting pain is gone.  The only side effect from the Pregabalin is that I believe it’s causing a skin rash on my thighs and calves.  I would classify it as eczema.  Cortisone cream controls the itching but it never completely goes away. Will talk to doc about it.,Jmm

By day 2 I started noticing my cravings for food were picking up by day 4 I was all out bingeing on EVERYTHING I could eat!  Day 4 I had gained 4 lbs and the heaviest I have ever been, up a whole pants size.  Mostly in my lower legs and feet. I stopped the drug at that point.  I noticed a bit of dry mouth and was drinking more water but actually more along the lines of what I should be drinking, no other symptoms.   I am already dealing with the fall out from the weight gain related to all the biologics, prednisone, dmards etc from the last two years of trials.  This just pushed me over the edge and I said enough.  I loath being this heavy.It did nothing for the pain but I do recognize I was not on it long enough.

I lost my cool with my last doctor because I was tired of being ignored and given zero pain killers. It's ruined my credit and my life and I needed something to try and get my life back. I saw a new doctor a week ago. He too, refused to give me anything. However, he was shocked no one prescribed me lyrica because most of my symptoms align with nerve damage. I know this medication has a lot of negative reviews. It seems it's a love/dislike medication. Either it works miracles or it's horrifyingly bad. I'm one of the people that was helped with this medication. It reduced my body-wide burning by 90%. I'm not back to feeling normal but I feel sooooooo much better.

My feet and hands became very painful and swollen. And my nerve pain seemed to get way worse. My ACL knee started to swell and become very stiff and hurt.

One major issue:  If I forget the morning pill, by afternoon I start to feel anxious, like I’d drunk too much coffee. If I forget the evening pill I get anxiety dreams which wake me around 2 am.

I was prescribed 50mg twice a day, but after a week, I was getting  frustrated with the side effects, so I cut back to 50mg just at night.  It really puts me to sleep, but I wake up groggy in the morning.  That lasts until mid afternoon.  But it deals very effectively with my nerve pain.  But then I am in pain until my next nightly dose.    I'm going to request a reduction in my dosage to 25mg. twice a day and see if that works for me to keep the relief level constant.

The key to minimizing side effects is to start on the lowest dose possible. I've noticed many doctors start at the max or even higher, even if you're new to the medicine. This is why so many people have so many side effects. I have few if any side effects and it's the only thing that works for my leg pain. I could barely sit without it, the pain was unbelievable. Now it's manageable. If this medicine is something you and your doctor are considering, ask to start at the lowest dose and only increase it if you're not getting relief. Many of the posters I see here with severe side effects are on 300-600mg a day when the max recommended dose is 300mg a day. Of course I don't blame patients for not knowing this. They should be able to trust their doctor. This medication can be so very helpful if used and prescribed correctly.",RNinpain
