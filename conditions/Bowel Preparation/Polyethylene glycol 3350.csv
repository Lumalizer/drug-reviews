0,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2022",0,"I have had a reaction to a medication before and was warned that I might be allergic to PEG.I was prescribed Miralax for colonoscopy prep, but at the time did not see that the main ingredient was PEG.After taking my dosage, within a couple of hours I was hit with severe chills, heart palpitations and agonizing bone/joint ache, I obviously did survive this.  I did have bone/joint achiness for at least the next 24 hours. I see that other people have not reported this here, but I thought this was a good place to make people aware of the possibility.",No PEG for me
1,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 12, 2021",0,"MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350):I have a coloscopy every five years. This time my doctor told me to get Dulcolax and Miralax as the bowel prep. Their instructions were to take four Dulcolax at noon and then four hours later to start taking the Miralax. They said to mix the Miralax with two quarts of clear liquid. I chose sugar free Sprite. No instructions were given as to how  much to drink at a time. At first nothing happened, then about two hours later, I had horrible stomach pains and severe diarrhea that continued through the night. At no time was it ever clear fluid. I went to the clinic the next day at ten but was concerned. Before the procedure my doctor asked me how I liked the Miralax which was unusual because he has never asked me this before. I told him it was not as effective as previous preps. Evidently this became pretty evident during the procedure because he noted on my chart that it wasn't. I had diarrhea for three days afterward. Never again.",CMW
2,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 9, 2021",0,"MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350):I took 2 ducalax tablets at 4 (totally forgot to take with a bunch of water) my stomach was in knots after about 30 minutes. I felt awful. Then I started the first half (32 ounces and 119 ounces of miralax) about 30 minutes after drinking it, I felt so so sick! It was like I induced the flu. My stomach hurt so bad and I was extremely nauseous. It subsided after a hour and a half. I think crapped my brains out for 4 hours. I took the second dose and I felt the same way. Felt extremely flu like for hours! My stomach hurt so bad! More pooping for about 4 hours. I honestly don’t know if I would recommend this way. It honestly cleared me out tho. They said it was a good prep. The nausea wasn’t worth it.",Colon prep
3,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 20, 2021",2,"MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350):I used this for my first colonoscopy prep this past week. I was so happy with the experience after hearing horror stories. I followed a low residue diet for four days then a clear liquid day. Mixing the miralax in Gatorade was tasteless and very easy to drink. I was able to do a split prep so even the volume I had to drink was tolerable. I had no cramping, no pain, no nausea. My doctor rated my prep as excellent. Would highly recommend this prep approach.",Easy first time
4,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 29, 2021",19,"MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350):Was prescribed Miralax & Dolcolax combination for colonoscopy prep, I was in tears hyperventilating from the horror story reviews in this forum. I came here to say: IT IS NOT THAT BAD. I’m 23 years old and (still) have a horrible fear of vomiting. I was petrified to take the doses prescribed because of some of these reviews. I forced myself to do it for the sake of getting this thing over with. Took 4 dulcolax at 4pm along with an anti nausea medicine, followed by the miralax solution starting at 5 pm. A couple of normal bowel movements within the first hour, then water like bowel movements every 20-30 mins until about 11pm/midnight. No pain, no vomiting, no nausea. Just diarrhea as intended. You’ll be a little chilly but NOTHING unbearable. You got it",nothappening
5,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 28, 2021",16,"MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350):I've used Miralax in the past for occasional constipation and it works well. For a recent colonoscopy, I had a problem with unusual constipation, so the doctor wanted me to do extra prep, so he had me drink seven glasses of Miralax the morning before the procedure. Later in the early evening, I had to start the regular foul-tasting prep drink. I can barely get that stuff down. Miralax has no taste. I was able to mix it with plain water and drink it with no problem. It's the easiest colonoscopy prep there is. The next time I have a colonoscopy, I'm going to insist that Miralax (along with Dulcolax tablets) is the only prep I have to drink.",DianeH
6,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,9.0,,"February 13, 2021",5,"Took the Dulcolax at 1:30 pm.  Had 1 explosion about 2:30.  Mixed the Miralax with lime Gatorade and drank 32 oz. at 3:30 pm. Started to the bathroom about 10 minutes later.  Lasted about 45 minutes back and forth to bathroom.  Took the 2nd dose at 6:30 pm. Same thing. Stools by this time were water and almost clear.  Had to wake up twice during the night but was done by morning. Only thing was I was so thirsty but couldn't drink before procedure at 8:15 am. My tips...eat a low fiber diet 2 days before.  Don't gorge yourself the day before (only makes you more hungry). I drank chicken broth, jello, gatorade, and apple juice. I didn't feel hungry at all. Completely clean for procedure.  Got home, ate scrambled eggs and toast and took a nap.  Stools back to normal within 2 days.Whole experience wasn't bad at all.",lucyl
7,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 17, 2021",50,"MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350):I'm about to have my 15th Colonoscopy. I'm only 53 but due to cancer I have 1 a year. I've tried every prep under the sun. The last Colonoscopy was January of 2020. I used the Dulcolax, Magnesium Citrate and MiraLax. Now I've learned from experience, I stop eating meats a week before the procedure. I only eat soft foods and 2 days before I go to just liquids. I did great with the cleansing. The only problem I had was the Magnesium Citrate, once I drank that bottle I vomited for almost an hour. Not nice it was coming out of both ends. Only drank half of the MiraLax and was clean. I mixed mine with Apple Juice I can't stand Gatorade. Wishing Everyone Luck with The Cleansing!",LilB

By 9:00 AM I had one normal bowel movement and one loose movement.  I drank more water, felt bloated and nauseous, but by 10:45 I had no more bowel movements.  I used a Fleet enema and stopped drinking because I was not allowed to drink any more 3 hours before my 1:00 PM colonoscopy.  My colonoscopy was aborted midway due to inadequate prep.  It is now 4 days later, and I still have diarrhea.  I do not recommend this for a bowel prep.",Joe
12,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 16, 2020",18,"MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350):I have always used miralax, plain with water, I just drink and get it over with. The dulcolax tabs work too so I don't ever have problems, but the magnesium citrate 6 hours before procedure, for me, is the worst. That 10 ounces of bitter salt water taste takes forever to finish - I'm already clean and still have to drink it.  I tried Moviprep  and  pain, stomach cramps were awful.  But with colon cancer years ago, I'm grateful each time colonoscopy is fine and a little nite of miralax is nothing.",There she goes

I was so scared that this was going to make me throw up as I have a severe fear of vomiting. This was a split dose mixed in with Gatorade and it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. No need to be anxious! Took my first dose at 5:30pm and was on the toilet at 7:30pm. No vomiting, just a lot out of the other end. Be prepared to run to the bathroom multiple times and have good soft toilet paper on hand. Other than that this was a good experience for a prep!",Angie
14,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 25, 2020",16,"MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350):I tried the Miralax colonoscopy prep about 3 weeks ago because I didn't want to have to drink the traditional prep and it sounded less awful.  BIG mistake.  I did exactly as I was supposed to, liquid diet, etc., and this made me so sick, I was up with diarrhea and vomiting all night.  Not only that, my 8:30am colonoscopy had to be canceled because I was nowhere near clear, even though I had taken all of it per instructions.  It has taken me 3 weeks for my bowels to become normal again and I'm getting ready to do a ""make-up"" colonoscopy using the traditional yucky drink. At least the yuck will work. Miralax as an occasional laxative is fine, but never for colonoscopy prep, at least not for me.",Anonymous

16,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,9.0,,"May 23, 2020",100,"MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350):If you've got IBS-C and motility issues like me, this should be a good read.I was terrified, because I know how horrendous the cramping/abdominal pain can be when taking laxatives, even ones as ""gentle"" as Miralax.While the feelings of fullness and slight nausea persisted, this prep wasn't painful and I didn't experience cramping. I'm thin, small and VERY sensitive to even small doses of meds, so I thought this bowel prep was going to wreck me. But it absolutely didn't. Remember, people only post reviews when they've had an experience SO far out of the norm, they felt the urge to warn others. The grand majority of us -- even with IBS and motility issues - get through this with moderate discomfort, yes, but no vomiting, cramping, or spasming.",anonymous

After the third dose I still had not  had a bowel movement.  Then all at once I broke out into a profuse cold sweat and felt as though I would pass out.  I headed for the bedroom to lay down then and after about 3 minutes a wave of nausea hit and I barely made it back to the bathroom before projectile vomit occurred.  This was my 3rd colonoscopy/endoscopy and NEVER AGAIN WILL I USE THIS PREP.  After I vomited the poison from my system, I felt better and continued with the process.  I was able to have the procedure but I told my doctor the what happened and he said from now on he would use Moviprep or Suprep.",Not Good

21,Polyethylene glycol 3350,Bowel Preparation,8.0,,"March 1, 2019",36,"MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350):Prep:  From 5 pm until 7pm, it went down fine with the Gatorade. Around 7pm, I was doing a lot of tooting. At 7:30 pm, I started with three bouts of semi solid stools. At 8 pm, I had a few room cleaning toots and felt like I was going to throw up from all that liquid I had to drink alongside the prep (I ate Jello and drank a lot of clear broth to keep my strength up.) I completed the prep mixture as instructed. Then, nothing but watery, murky sludge from 8:30pm until 4am in 15 minute spurts. Your butt will start firing off some lava sludge after the first few bouts. It is a normal part of the prep, and it causes a definite rash where your external sphincter is. I slept from 4am until 9am and did one more sludge bout but the sludge was more yellow and only a few flecks were visible. I felt like I was going to go again on the ride up but no more sludge happened when I went to use the bathroom before my procedure. The doctor was satisfied with how clean my colon was for the procedure.",A.

Drank entire prep between 7 pm and 1130 pm. Nothing happened until 1230 am. Was up entire night on toilet until my colonoscopy at 630 am including at doctor office. However my prep was super clean and don’t need for  another 10 years so it was worth staying up all night for. I recommend - it wasn't that hard to drink no cramping or pain just bloating feeling.
