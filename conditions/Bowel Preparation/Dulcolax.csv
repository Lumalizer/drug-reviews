Doctor advised me to take 4 pills at 2:00pm and at 5pm to drink the Miralax mixture. My first diarrhea bm was around 6pm with some slight cramping and sweating. The pain disappeared for the rest of the night and I thought that was it, not as bad as people say it was. NO! I was so wrong. Woke up around 1am to excruciating stomach pain that would come in waves of every 4-5 mins and then on top of that I started Feeling nauseous and vomited twice. The pain continue for the rest of the morning.",THC
1,Dulcolax,Bowel Preparation,10.0,,"January 26, 2022",0,I used Dulcolax for bowel prep before colonoscopy. I was really nervous after reading the stories here. I was instructed to take 2 after a clear breakfast the morning before my colonoscopy then 2 at 3 pm. Because I had to work that day I instead took the first dose at 2 pm and second dose at 4:30.The first dose I didn't drink a lot of water but with the second dose I did. I continued drinking water until I started the miralax mix. I had NO cramping or  anything explosive. The experience was much better than I thought it would be. If you use these for colonoscopy prep make sure you drink a lot of water. I drank about 1.5 gallons when I started the Dulcolax before the miralax then about 1 gallon after. This was a breeze and I really couldn't be happier with the results.,RC234

3,Dulcolax,Bowel Preparation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 21, 2021",0,"HORRIBLE DRUG - DO NOT TAKE!  I took 4 Dulcolax tablets as directed by my doctor at 4 pm.  At 10 pm, the gates of hell opened with severe cramps and explosive diarrhea - nothing gentle about this! The worst thing, though was at 2 AM after another bout of pain and diarrhea.  I became drenched with sweat and nauseated.  I stumbled (literally) out of the bathroom and passed out on the floor.  My husband helped me up and I told him to get me to the bathroom (still had to go).  On the way, I passed out again!  Considered calling an ambulance as I had never felt anything like this before.  The diarrhea went on the 18 hours- into the next day.  DO NOT TAKE THIS!  I am really surprised there are not more warnings on the box about this or lawsuits filed from people who faint and get hurt falling down.  The irony of the whole thing---- my colonoscapy got re-scheduled by the doctor's office but only AFTER I had taken this wretched drug.",Square Peg

5,Dulcolax,Bowel Preparation,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 8, 2021",0,"I see there is way too much variation in dosage here, from 2 pills X 2 a day before colonoscopy prep to 5X3 Times! My instructions were 4 the day before plus 4 more on day of procedure, even though is was only 3-4 hours before. The morning prep did nothing but continue my diarrhea for 12 hours AFTER The procedure, a big waste, pun intended. These high dose  instructions seem to be for the most constipated denominator of patients, and serve the docs and nurses only. They wouldn't let me change the dosage when I asked. I want to give this a 1, but gave a 3 because, well, it works!",Oregon patient
6,Dulcolax,Bowel Preparation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 15, 2021",0,"I have IBS-D so when I did my colonoscopy prep I was very nervous about taking 4 dulcolax and then the 64 oz of miralax solution.  I wasn't going to take the 4 pills after reading all these reviews, but I decided to listen to my doctor.  I did not experience any of the symptoms everyone is putting on this forum. No cramps or pain, just that feeling of having to go to the bathroom, quickly.  I ate lightly 2 days before the prep and made sure I had bowel movements on those days.  So when it came time for the the prep day, I felt that I didn't have a ""load"" in my intestines and colon.  After 4 pills and 32 oz of gatorade/miralax I was cleaned out. I started taking the second half of gatorade at 2:30 am, but could only get 1 glass down due to feeling bloated and full, plus I was still going to the bathroom after taking the first half and had to travel 20 miles to get to the hospital. Didn't want to have an accident on the way.  Colon was clean.",jrussell

By 11:30am I was in extreme agony with excruciatingly painful abdominal cramps. I sat on the toilet thinking that I had to have a bowel movement, only a tiny amount came out. Cramps continued with a vengeance as well as nausea and extreme sweating. Finally after an hour, an explosion of very liquid diarrhea which has continued every 15 minutes since. It's now been 1 -1/2 hrs since the cramps began and they seem to be easing slightly. I have to do this again tomorrow according to the instructions on the bowel prep sheet. Can't wait!",Anonymous
8,Dulcolax,Bowel Preparation,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 15, 2021",0,"Ok so this is my third attempt at getting a colonoscopy.  Had bowel issues all my life.. first 2 times were with a liquid, first in was I giant jug of chalky white stuff.. had such a bad reaction after one glass. Second one was a powder to put into juice, pop, or Gatorade. Again a terrible reaction, made it to the second of three packs before my husband called an ambulance.  That was 10 and 5 years ago respectively. The fear of the prep kept me from trying for a long time. But this time I got the dulcolax.  2 every 2 hours from 8am the day before, I was terrified.. but I didn't become sick!! I had very mild nausea, and frequent watery bm's. But no terrible cramps, no vomiting, no need for medical attention! Sorry to everyone who had bad experiences but this is the prep I will recommend to anyone I know.",Canadiangirl84
9,Dulcolax,Bowel Preparation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 22, 2021",27,"I left a previous review. Things are going well with ONE Dulcolax per day. Tomorrow is C-day (colonoscopy day) ! I wanted to update re: cramps. If you’re very constipated and use this, those cramps are your body’s peristalsis (muscle contractions) trying to move the poop so it can be eliminated. To make it easier for the medication to work, you need to drink more fluids. This will help minimise the cramps as the poop will move more easily. Please only take ONE every 24 hours.",Use cautiously
10,Dulcolax,Bowel Preparation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 18, 2021",57,"I'm prepping for a colonoscopy in 6 days. Due to being on strong opioids, I was advised to start dulcolax yesterday. I took ONE tablet at 2200. At 1300 today, I had a bowel motion, very soft, easy to pass. At 1430, I had a much looser, and smelly bowel motion. It's really important for people to understand that this medication takes time to work. Do NOT take more tablets if you don't open your bowels. Do NOT take more than ONE unless you are day before bowel prepping. This medication is safe to take daily, ONE per day, as that is what we give patients in hospital (I'm also a nurse). These patients don't have side effects. But it's important to only take ONE. I empathise with all those who left reviews but, don't ever take more than one tablet, every 24 hours. I wasn't prepared for how much came out today, it'll be interesting to see how things pan out over the next few days. Saying that, don't trust a fart while using and ensure plenty of fluids but stick to ONE.",Use cautiously

Hardly any pain, just needed to poop pain. Do not have this with a meal, do not crush the tablet, do not drink it with milk and make sure you drink alot of water.

16,Dulcolax,Bowel Preparation,10.0,,"January 7, 2021",15,"Prepared for a flexible sigmoidoscopy on a Friday at 1pm began Wednesday. Wednesday: light breakfast of solids, the rest of the day 1 gallon of water spaced out and clear liquid fluid foods. Had a BM as I usually daily do in the morning.. 1 dulcolax 4:30 pm that Wednesday with 2 bottles of water, regular BM at 11:30 pm.....I wondered why I wasn’t running to the washroom or in any painful symptoms described here. Set an alarm at 6am Thursday and popped 2 more with 2 bottles of water. Normal BM as I usually daily do, and then a normal but large watery BM at 3pm. No symptoms again as described in other reviews. I think the key to the prep is just drink a ton of water, and when you think you can’t drink anymore, drink some more. I wondered why I wasn’t making more BMs all Wednesday or Thursday but it’s likely because I eat clean and I also already wasn’t eating solids when I had began the prep....",Hotbeans20

I told them I had taken dulcalax once before and it made me very sick so they gave me zofran. Zofran didn't work, all it did was give me a migraine.

It just rushed out, I didn't even know it was coming. Left me bleaching half the bathroom and plainly throwing out my bottoms, and showering at 1:30 am.

I read a lot of these comments and was terrified about what might happen. I stayed well-hydrated all day, took 4 Dulcolax at 3 pm. Then at 5 pm, I started the process of drinking a whole bottle of Miralax. By 3:45 I had a standard BM. From then on I had slight bubble guts, and an occasional gas pain. By 7:20, I had completed my Miralax prep for the evening. I had two small watery BMs around 6 and 6:45pm. The serious action started around 7:45. Large, urgent, watery BMs about every 5-10 minutes until about 8:30. One more at 9:30, and a smaller one at 11:30. During that first active window I felt pretty rough. I felt nauseated but never threw up. I was exhausted and couldn’t really focus. I stayed hydrated as I could. So, bottom line is that it’s no picnic, as I was certainly emptying my bowels fast... but neither was I writhing on the floor in pain.  Whew!",ADt

A week ago I took two pills because I was backed up for 5 days and it was the worst experience of my life! I took this in the night and around 7 am I woke up too terribly bad cramps and this went on for like 30 minutes and I decide to go to the bathroom and thank godddd I did because it came out like a water hose and I almost threw up. And this lasted the entire day! When I finally thought it was over I ate literally just a piece/crumb of bread and I had to run to the bathroom again. I went on my phone to see reviews about this product and I was so disappointed in my self for not reading the comments before I took this.

I have used Dulcolax as a bowel prep for the last 12 procedures. It is not fun during the bowel prep, you will probably experience painful cramping just like you would any other time you have diarrhea, but that is the point of a bowel prep. You have to be thoroughly cleaned out. You will need to be home and near a bathroom during your entire prep, this is not a time to leave your house!  If you are afraid of taking this many pills, ask your doctor for a different prep. I will never go back to one of the gross liquid drink preps, this has worked 100% for me.",Kristy

Monday night I took 2 Dulcolax and about 7:30 Tuesday morning I could feel it was time.  It started easy and went to more liquid.  4 or 5 trips.  Then about 3:00 on Tuesday, I started the Miralax drink.  It started to work in about an hour.  By night time, I was just about finished.  Directions had me drink more but I had one more glass and had to get back to the bathroom about 4:00 am.  I was still passing just a little water when I got to the hospital.  This was the easiest prep I have ever had.  Usually drinking all that stuff makes me nauseous and vomit.  I think you have to find what works for you and stick with it.

Anyways, I just recently got surgery and haven’t been using the restroom barely at all from all the pain meds. So my mom gave me these to try. She said take 2-3. So around 8pm I decided I take 3. By 11pm I was done for. The worst stomach cramps had started. Those were coming in like contractions and I begin throwing up almost every 5-8 mins for two hours. I also was going poop quite often, and once I had nothing left to throw up, I had a lot of diarrhea. I would not recommend these.  A laxative should not have you in the much pain and vomiting. Also it’s now the next day, and I’m exhausted probably dehydrated, and my stomach is still having minor pains and bowel movements.",Lilriddle26

At 2am I woke up with the worst stomach pains I’ve ever felt. I mean ever. I laid in bed not knowing if I should go to the hospital or wait it out. I waited it out and a few minutes into the pain I felt like I was going to vomit everywhere. A few minutes into feeling like I was going to vomit I also felt like I was going to poop my pants. I went to sit on the toilet and thought I was going to poop everywhere. Instead I took a tiny dump. I went back to bed and still felt pain. 30 minutes later I ran to the toilet and took a massive dump. Now I am still in pain and just waiting for more poop to come as I am still feeling like garbage. I’ve had a chocolate laxative before and felt nothing like this. I will not take this product again.,Lou

49,Dulcolax,Bowel Preparation,9.0,,"August 12, 2018",11,First took Dulcolax as a bowel prep in conjunction with Miralax.  They found diverticulitis and a 2cm cancerous polyp.  Small bowel resection performed.  That bowel prep combo was brutal (pretreat area with desitine) so I'm more concerned with bowel movements and pressure being regular now.  2 dulcolax isn't the right dosage for me.  If you are generally regular and you are a couple days over due here's my advice.  Take ONE tablet early saturday morning with about 20 ounces of water.  Within 2-5 hours you'll notice the cramping and you should have a bowel movement sometime Saturday afternoon to night.  If you take it at night it will wake you up and you will have some residual effects the next day.  So I never take when I have to work the next day.  Taking 2 is too much and the movement becomes watery for 12 hours with an uncomfortable feeling the second day all day.  Medication acts differently on everyone so adjust your dosage afterward trying just 1.,Cerryberry

I don't remember anything bad about the first except for that nasty tasting lax. I read the post about Dulcolax and almost threw them away, Who would know, right? But I thought I had taken them the first time. Sooo. I have always drank LOTS of water, still do. 2 gallons a day is not unusual. Several posts suggested that those who had pain did not drink enough liquids before and after. I took a chance. Copious amounts of liquids Sunday AM. Peed every 20 min or so, not just a little, full bladder each time. At 1PM 4 dulcolax as directed. (I'm only just 200 lbs) Lots of gatorade white grape juice and 7up followed. Still peed a river every half hour or less. First BM at 3, soft and easy. It's almost 9 AM time for the fun and I'm about to mess the bed. Nurse says the doctor will take care of it and off we go. Scope went like a charm, talked to the Doc and back home. In bed couldn't make it to the toilet. Back in my man diaper waiting for my bowels to become stable. Now as for nausea and cramping. At 10 PM Sunday I had a very very mild case of both. But I was very hungry. Chicken broth and jello later and it went away. Was that from the Dulcolax? Don't know, not an issue. But I'm pretty sure that some of the yuk drink is still in me. My advice, drink drink drink before, during and after Dulcolax, but then that's what the instructions said.",Doug part 1
