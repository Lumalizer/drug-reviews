0,Senokot,Bowel Preparation,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2022",3,Dehydration can cause constipation. So if you're dehydrated and then take a laxative it WILL cause cramping. You got to keep in mind in order for laxatives to work it has to pull fluid from your body in order to soften your stool. That's the reason your poo is watery. Dehydration alone causes leg cramps and  dizziness. So making sure you drink plenty of water before and after taking laxative. I would be highly recommended. It will help with preventing and easing bad side effects.,Anonymous
1,Senokot,Bowel Preparation,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 24, 2021",0,"What I am about to write is unsolicited, not recompensed, nor asking for freebies. I am 81 years old and have been troubled by constipation  and lack of a dependable laxative or medication for years. About 4 months ago I started taking Extra strength Senokot with an ""oh well"" attitude. Boy was I shocked and surprised! From the very start I began having boel motions the very next day that were well formed and complete. My success with Senokot gladdened an old man's heart. Thank you, thank you, thank you. So much advertising is crap (pun intended) Your product works.",Fred Samson
