0,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 12, 2021",0,"I have a coloscopy every five years. This time my doctor told me to get Dulcolax and Miralax as the bowel prep. Their instructions were to take four Dulcolax at noon and then four hours later to start taking the Miralax. They said to mix the Miralax with two quarts of clear liquid. I chose sugar free Sprite. No instructions were given as to how  much to drink at a time. At first nothing happened, then about two hours later, I had horrible stomach pains and severe diarrhea that continued through the night. At no time was it ever clear fluid. I went to the clinic the next day at ten but was concerned. Before the procedure my doctor asked me how I liked the Miralax which was unusual because he has never asked me this before. I told him it was not as effective as previous preps. Evidently this became pretty evident during the procedure because he noted on my chart that it wasn't. I had diarrhea for three days afterward. Never again.",CMW
1,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 9, 2021",0,"I took 2 ducalax tablets at 4 (totally forgot to take with a bunch of water) my stomach was in knots after about 30 minutes. I felt awful. Then I started the first half (32 ounces and 119 ounces of miralax) about 30 minutes after drinking it, I felt so so sick! It was like I induced the flu. My stomach hurt so bad and I was extremely nauseous. It subsided after a hour and a half. I think crapped my brains out for 4 hours. I took the second dose and I felt the same way. Felt extremely flu like for hours! My stomach hurt so bad! More pooping for about 4 hours. I honestly don’t know if I would recommend this way. It honestly cleared me out tho. They said it was a good prep. The nausea wasn’t worth it.",Colon prep
2,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 20, 2021",2,"I used this for my first colonoscopy prep this past week. I was so happy with the experience after hearing horror stories. I followed a low residue diet for four days then a clear liquid day. Mixing the miralax in Gatorade was tasteless and very easy to drink. I was able to do a split prep so even the volume I had to drink was tolerable. I had no cramping, no pain, no nausea. My doctor rated my prep as excellent. Would highly recommend this prep approach.",Easy first time
3,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 29, 2021",19,"Was prescribed Miralax & Dolcolax combination for colonoscopy prep, I was in tears hyperventilating from the horror story reviews in this forum. I came here to say: IT IS NOT THAT BAD. I’m 23 years old and (still) have a horrible fear of vomiting. I was petrified to take the doses prescribed because of some of these reviews. I forced myself to do it for the sake of getting this thing over with. Took 4 dulcolax at 4pm along with an anti nausea medicine, followed by the miralax solution starting at 5 pm. A couple of normal bowel movements within the first hour, then water like bowel movements every 20-30 mins until about 11pm/midnight. No pain, no vomiting, no nausea. Just diarrhea as intended. You’ll be a little chilly but NOTHING unbearable. You got it",nothappening
4,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 28, 2021",16,"I've used Miralax in the past for occasional constipation and it works well. For a recent colonoscopy, I had a problem with unusual constipation, so the doctor wanted me to do extra prep, so he had me drink seven glasses of Miralax the morning before the procedure. Later in the early evening, I had to start the regular foul-tasting prep drink. I can barely get that stuff down. Miralax has no taste. I was able to mix it with plain water and drink it with no problem. It's the easiest colonoscopy prep there is. The next time I have a colonoscopy, I'm going to insist that Miralax (along with Dulcolax tablets) is the only prep I have to drink.",DianeH
5,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 17, 2021",50,"I'm about to have my 15th Colonoscopy. I'm only 53 but due to cancer I have 1 a year. I've tried every prep under the sun. The last Colonoscopy was January of 2020. I used the Dulcolax, Magnesium Citrate and MiraLax. Now I've learned from experience, I stop eating meats a week before the procedure. I only eat soft foods and 2 days before I go to just liquids. I did great with the cleansing. The only problem I had was the Magnesium Citrate, once I drank that bottle I vomited for almost an hour. Not nice it was coming out of both ends. Only drank half of the MiraLax and was clean. I mixed mine with Apple Juice I can't stand Gatorade. Wishing Everyone Luck with The Cleansing!",LilB
6,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 17, 2020",9,"Started this on the evening before the test  After the first litre heart started racing, vision was affected  migraine eye disturbances followed by migraine type headache then uncontrollable dithering / shaking. Hospital tests rule out stroke etc. Decided this prep didn't suit me.  A frightening experience I didn't repeat it and my Dr switched me to a MRI.",rene
7,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,1,,"October 3, 2020",10,"I am a 190 lb man and took the Miralax/Gatorade bowel prep (Dulcolax and  Gas-X, then 8 oz Miralax in 64 oz Gatorade, drink for 2 hours) starting at 6:00 AM following a day of liquid diet.  By 9:00 AM I had one normal bowel movement and one loose movement.  I drank more water, felt bloated and nauseous, but by 10:45 I had no more bowel movements.  I used a Fleet enema and stopped drinking because I was not allowed to drink any more 3 hours before my 1:00 PM colonoscopy.  My colonoscopy was aborted midway due to inadequate prep.  It is now 4 days later, and I still have diarrhea.  I do not recommend this for a bowel prep.",Joe
8,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 16, 2020",18,"I have always used miralax, plain with water, I just drink and get it over with. The dulcolax tabs work too so I don't ever have problems, but the magnesium citrate 6 hours before procedure, for me, is the worst. That 10 ounces of bitter salt water taste takes forever to finish - I'm already clean and still have to drink it.  I tried Moviprep  and  pain, stomach cramps were awful.  But with colon cancer years ago, I'm grateful each time colonoscopy is fine and a little nite of miralax is nothing.",There she goes
9,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,10,,"September 4, 2020",47,"I used thr MiraLAX in preparation for a colonoscopy. I'm 23 years old and a female. I was so scared that this was going to make me throw up as I have a severe fear of vomiting. This was a split dose mixed in with Gatorade and it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. No need to be anxious! Took my first dose at 5:30pm and was on the toilet at 7:30pm. No vomiting, just a lot out of the other end. Be prepared to run to the bathroom multiple times and have good soft toilet paper on hand. Other than that this was a good experience for a prep!",Angie
10,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 25, 2020",16,"I tried the Miralax colonoscopy prep about 3 weeks ago because I didn't want to have to drink the traditional prep and it sounded less awful.  BIG mistake.  I did exactly as I was supposed to, liquid diet, etc., and this made me so sick, I was up with diarrhea and vomiting all night.  Not only that, my 8:30am colonoscopy had to be canceled because I was nowhere near clear, even though I had taken all of it per instructions.  It has taken me 3 weeks for my bowels to become normal again and I'm getting ready to do a ""make-up"" colonoscopy using the traditional yucky drink. At least the yuck will work. Miralax as an occasional laxative is fine, but never for colonoscopy prep, at least not for me.",Anonymous
11,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 6, 2020",17,This was my third Colonoscopy but first time with MiraLax. I ended up in the Emergency Room and spent 15 hours vomiting and had Severe Upper Abdominals Pain.,Carol
12,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,9,,"May 23, 2020",100,"If you've got IBS-C and motility issues like me, this should be a good read.I was terrified, because I know how horrendous the cramping/abdominal pain can be when taking laxatives, even ones as ""gentle"" as Miralax.While the feelings of fullness and slight nausea persisted, this prep wasn't painful and I didn't experience cramping. I'm thin, small and VERY sensitive to even small doses of meds, so I thought this bowel prep was going to wreck me. But it absolutely didn't. Remember, people only post reviews when they've had an experience SO far out of the norm, they felt the urge to warn others. The grand majority of us -- even with IBS and motility issues - get through this with moderate discomfort, yes, but no vomiting, cramping, or spasming.",anonymous
13,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 19, 2019",34,"I used this Miralax prep last week along with Dulcolax and I will NEVER use it again.  After the third dose I still had not  had a bowel movement.  Then all at once I broke out into a profuse cold sweat and felt as though I would pass out.  I headed for the bedroom to lay down then and after about 3 minutes a wave of nausea hit and I barely made it back to the bathroom before projectile vomit occurred.  This was my 3rd colonoscopy/endoscopy and NEVER AGAIN WILL I USE THIS PREP.  After I vomited the poison from my system, I felt better and continued with the process.  I was able to have the procedure but I told my doctor the what happened and he said from now on he would use Moviprep or Suprep.",Not Good

15,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 16, 2019",13,I took the MiraLax and it never even began to clean the bowel.  It was a wasted Consultant visit and day of prep on clear liquids.,Tj
16,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 10, 2019",24,"This is the second time I took Miralax and had an allergic reaction to it.I was on steroids before my last colonoscopy so it did not bother me.  The last time I took Miralax the Dr. could barely see, almost like a poop storm without wipers. Not good prep for me.So I have to reschedule to get another polyp out.  And don't ever use the word constipation or they will place you on a 3 day no food regiment. Then Draino.",Dr. Toot
17,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,8,,"March 1, 2019",36,"Prep:  From 5 pm until 7pm, it went down fine with the Gatorade. Around 7pm, I was doing a lot of tooting. At 7:30 pm, I started with three bouts of semi solid stools. At 8 pm, I had a few room cleaning toots and felt like I was going to throw up from all that liquid I had to drink alongside the prep (I ate Jello and drank a lot of clear broth to keep my strength up.) I completed the prep mixture as instructed. Then, nothing but watery, murky sludge from 8:30pm until 4am in 15 minute spurts. Your butt will start firing off some lava sludge after the first few bouts. It is a normal part of the prep, and it causes a definite rash where your external sphincter is. I slept from 4am until 9am and did one more sludge bout but the sludge was more yellow and only a few flecks were visible. I felt like I was going to go again on the ride up but no more sludge happened when I went to use the bathroom before my procedure. The doctor was satisfied with how clean my colon was for the procedure.",A.
18,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,2,,"January 7, 2019",15,Have had many colonoscopies due to colon cancer in family.  I had used Miralax before with no problem.  This time after 4 doses I started vomiting and did not stop until the MiraLax Gatorade mixture was mostly out of my system.,JJ
19,MiraLAX,Bowel Preparation,10,,"November 29, 2018",35,I drank the miralax in 64 oz Gatorade for colonoscopy. No other laxative used. Drank entire prep between 7 pm and 1130 pm. Nothing happened until 1230 am. Was up entire night on toilet until my colonoscopy at 630 am including at doctor office. However my prep was super clean and don’t need for  another 10 years so it was worth staying up all night for. I recommend - it wasn't that hard to drink no cramping or pain just bloating feeling. Tasted fine.,Amyliz
