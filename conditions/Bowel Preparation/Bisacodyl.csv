Doctor advised me to take 4 pills at 2:00pm and at 5pm to drink the Miralax mixture. My first diarrhea bm was around 6pm with some slight cramping and sweating. The pain disappeared for the rest of the night and I thought that was it, not as bad as people say it was. NO! I was so wrong. Woke up around 1am to excruciating stomach pain that would come in waves of every 4-5 mins and then on top of that I started Feeling nauseous and vomited twice.

2,Bisacodyl,Bowel Preparation,10.0,,"January 26, 2022",0,Dulcolax (bisacodyl):I used Dulcolax for bowel prep before colonoscopy. I was really nervous after reading the stories here. I was instructed to take 2 after a clear breakfast the morning before my colonoscopy then 2 at 3 pm. Because I had to work that day I instead took the first dose at 2 pm and second dose at 4:30.The first dose I didn't drink a lot of water but with the second dose I did. I continued drinking water until I started the miralax mix. I had NO cramping or  anything explosive. The experience was much better than I thought it would be. If you use these for colonoscopy prep make sure you drink a lot of water. I drank about 1.5 gallons when I started the Dulcolax before the miralax then about 1 gallon after. This was a breeze and I really couldn't be happier with the results.,RC234

At 10 pm, the gates of hell opened with severe cramps and explosive diarrhea - nothing gentle about this! The worst thing, though was at 2 AM after another bout of pain and diarrhea.  I became drenched with sweat and nauseated.  I stumbled (literally) out of the bathroom and passed out on the floor.  My husband helped me up and I told him to get me to the bathroom (still had to go).  On the way, I passed out again!  Considered calling an ambulance as I had never felt anything like this before.  The diarrhea went on the 18 hours- into the next day.  DO NOT TAKE THIS!  I am really surprised there are not more warnings on the box about this or lawsuits filed from people who faint and get hurt falling down.

My instructions were 4 the day before plus 4 more on day of procedure, even though is was only 3-4 hours before. The morning prep did nothing but continue my diarrhea for 12 hours AFTER The procedure, a big waste, pun intended.

I wasn't going to take the 4 pills after reading all these reviews, but I decided to listen to my doctor.  I did not experience any of the symptoms everyone is putting on this forum. No cramps or pain, just that feeling of having to go to the bathroom, quickly.  I ate lightly 2 days before the prep and made sure I had bowel movements on those days.  So when it came time for the the prep day, I felt that I didn't have a ""load"" in my intestines and colon.  After 4 pills and 32 oz of gatorade/miralax I was cleaned out. I started taking the second half of gatorade at 2:30 am, but could only get 1 glass down due to feeling bloated and full, plus I was still going to the bathroom after taking the first half and had to travel 20 miles to get to the hospital.

9,Bisacodyl,Bowel Preparation,1.0,,"September 9, 2021",0,"I was prescribed bisacodyl, as part of my colonoscopy prep.  It came as part of a colonoscopy prep kit.  I am not someone who normally has constipation and had never had this drug before.  At 2:00 pm I took the first dose of 2 pills.  By 3:30 I was vomiting so hard, I could barely breathe.  I looked on the package and online and did not find any cautions about this drug causing vomiting, so I thought maybe my hunger (had already been fasting at that point) coupled with a Tylenol I had taken and the bisacodyl together had been too much for my stomach.  Fast forward to 9:00 pm, time for the second dose of 2 pills.  By 10:30 I was once again vomiting extremely hard.  I began to be worried that the colonoscopy prep was too much for my system and that maybe I was on the verge of having a medical emergency.  I was sweating and had chills.  It was traumatizing.

Second one was a powder to put into juice, pop, or Gatorade. Again a terrible reaction, made it to the second of three packs before my husband called an ambulance.  That was 10 and 5 years ago respectively. The fear of the prep kept me from trying for a long time. But this time I got the dulcolax.  2 every 2 hours from 8am the day before, I was terrified.. but I didn't become sick!! I had very mild nausea, and frequent watery bm's.

Tomorrow is C-day (colonoscopy day) ! I wanted to update re: cramps. If you’re very constipated and use this, those cramps are your body’s peristalsis (muscle contractions) trying to move the poop so it can be eliminated. To make it easier for the medication to work, you need to drink more fluids. This will help minimise the cramps as the poop will move more easily. Please only take ONE every 24 hours.",Use cautiously
13,Bisacodyl,Bowel Preparation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 18, 2021",57,"Dulcolax (bisacodyl):I'm prepping for a colonoscopy in 6 days. Due to being on strong opioids, I was advised to start dulcolax yesterday. I took ONE tablet at 2200. At 1300 today, I had a bowel motion, very soft, easy to pass. At 1430, I had a much looser, and smelly bowel motion. It's really important for people to understand that this medication takes time to work. Do NOT take more tablets if you don't open your bowels. Do NOT take more than ONE unless you are day before bowel prepping. This medication is safe to take daily, ONE per day, as that is what we give patients in hospital (I'm also a nurse). These patients don't have side effects. But it's important to only take ONE. I empathise with all those who left reviews but, don't ever take more than one tablet, every 24 hours. I wasn't prepared for how much came out today, it'll be interesting to see how things pan out over the next few days. Saying that, don't trust a fart while using and ensure plenty of fluids but stick to ONE.",Use cautiously

Set an alarm at 6am Thursday and popped 2 more with 2 bottles of water. Normal BM as I usually daily do, and then a normal but large watery BM at 3pm. No symptoms again as described in other reviews. I think the key to the prep is just drink a ton of water, and when you think you can’t drink anymore, drink some more. I wondered why I wasn’t making more BMs all Wednesday or Thursday but it’s likely because I eat clean and I also already wasn’t eating solids when I had began the prep....",Hotbeans20

Small bowel resection performed.  That bowel prep combo was brutal (pretreat area with desitine) so I'm more concerned with bowel movements and pressure being regular now.  2 dulcolax isn't the right dosage for me.  If you are generally regular and you are a couple days over due here's my advice.  Take ONE tablet early saturday morning with about 20 ounces of water.  Within 2-5 hours you'll notice the cramping and you should have a bowel movement sometime Saturday afternoon to night.  If you take it at night it will wake you up and you will have some residual effects the next day.  So I never take when I have to work the next day.  Taking 2 is too much and the movement becomes watery for 12 hours with an uncomfortable feeling the second day all day.

I took them at 11 pm with a full glass of water and went to sleep completely prepared to get up and work the next day but woke up around 6 am sweating with intense stomach cramping and horrible pain. I threw up twice before almost missing the toilet and practically spraying watery diahrea for 30 minutes, all while shaking, and having horrible pain and nausea, even after vomiting and going to the bathroom.

I broke out into a horrible sweat and was laying on the floor literally felt like I was having an allergic reaction to the pill or something other. It was a horrible experience and two days later my stomach still hurts. Great for some people but I was too sensitive for this. I will never take it again.

It came time to take this medicine, I was in so much pain, that I almost went to the hospital prior to my test. I thought something went terribly wrong. Hours upon hours of violent diarrhea and cramps like I have never felt before in my life. The sweats were terrible. I actually pooped my pants the following morning as this med had taken over my entire digestive system. I had no control of my bowels. Not normal for a 37 yo.. I had to drive to the test with a towel between my bottom cheeks for fear of pooping myself again. DO NOT TAKE THIS unless you enjoy unbearable pain!!!!",Fire bum
91,Bisacodyl,Bowel Preparation,2.0,,"August 29, 2016",3,I took 4 in preparation for a colonoscopy tomorrow.  They told me take 4 at 3 pm and then at 5 mix a 14 dose container of miralax with 64 oz of water and drink 8 oz every half hour until it's gone which would take 4 hours. After drinking 1-1/2 quarts I started feeling sick and threw up probably every bit of liquid I drank.  Here it is 7 hours after I took 4 dulcolax and i haven't gone yet.  It's 10 pm.  My colonoscopy is at noon tomorrow.  If I start going I'll be up all night pooping.  Ridiculous.  One thing I want to say after reading others posts.
