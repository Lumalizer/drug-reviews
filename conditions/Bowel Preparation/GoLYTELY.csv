0,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 11, 2022",0,"I was in the hospital with what they thought was a bezoar (turned out to be ischemic colitis). I was given this solution to prepare for a colonoscopy and in hopes of passing the bezoar so I didn't have to have surgery. Anyway, I drank it down, and got down to only a fourth of it left when I started vomiting. I even blacked out when I tried to go to the bathroom, and vomited at the same time. I wasn't able to finish the prep. I had no bowel movements from the first dose. The next day, I had to do it all over again. It wasn't causing me to go poop, and drinking it made me nauseous. I ended up having to have an enema to complete the prep. I definitely do not recommend this. Prepping for a colonoscopy is bad enough without the side effects from this prep. I would definitely recommend people do the MiraLAX/Gatorade prep, as it is much easier on your system.",brodycarrawyn137
1,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2021",0,"It works,  but is miserable. I added 2 packets of crystal lemonade flavor.  That helped me get it down.  After the 5th glass I started coughing,  then all of a sudden started throwing up.  I wasn't prepared for that- so glad the bathtub was close by.  Finished the 1st half at 7 pm the night before the procedure,  then had to finish the rest starting at 4:30 am.  I feel awful.  My recommendations,  be prepared to throw up.  Put in some flavor.  Wear depends incontinence pants - I would have had to change the sheets at 2 am if I hadn't thought of that.  Get a bidet!  My bum would have been so sore without the bidet.  There has to be a more pleasant way to clean yourself out.  This stuff is awful.",Awful Pooper
2,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 12, 2021",6,"I will share that if you have the option go with moviprep instead of GoLYTELY, then take the moviprep option. I've was dreading this procedure because of the GoLytely prep. I read all the reviews of options and moviprep was an alternative. My fear was that maybe it could be worse!  Can anything actually be worse than the gallon of GoLYTELY? I took the chance on moviprep The Good:  It's half the liquid!  The Bad: It cost $70.  not formulary. Result: It was definitely worth it.  It was manageable and I won't dread the next one as much now that I have this option.",Grant Davenport
3,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 7, 2020",15,"This is my third time downing this GoLYTELY in my adult life. Twice for severe, chronic constipation via ER and today for the GI Doctor before my Colonoscopy. I have tried it with sodas and Gatorade, but I can always taste the salty bitterness beneath it. This time I am chasing it down with peppermint tea as that is a natural stomach calmer and anti-bloat. Ask your doctor if you can have anti-nausea medication alongside the prep, and do what makes you the most comfortable otherwise. Ice chips, pyjamas, a bath, laying in bed with your favorite show on under your favorite blanket, a cold cloth for any potential sweating, a towel or vomit bag just in case. If you puke, take a short break before continuing. You're gonna be alright by morning, I promise. It will get the job done, even if it tastes bad or makes you cramp up.",Caitlin

5,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2020",20,"I was absolutely terrified of this GoLYTELY prep,   I'm 7 glasses in and I haven't puked, no serious cramping, and overall, it's not nearly as bad as what I was expecting. It's doing it's job and it's cleaning me out!  I mixed it with powdered lemonade (heavy on the lemonade) and the taste didn't bother me at all.  I drank a cup at a time, chilled, and through a straw.  The worst part for me is that I'm HUNGRY!!!  My procedure is at 7am in the morning and I started my prep at noon the day before.  I'll be done before 4pm and then I'll just have to starve until after the procedure.  I would say that the worst so far is that my anus is so sore!! And I want to eat!!",MissPoopsAlot
6,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,10.0,,"November 2, 2020",6,"Basically I was hesitant to even do a colonoscopy out of fear for the prep. I started the prep super early just in case there was an issue. Basically started it 24hrs before my procedure. I have IBS-C so I know how slow my body pushes things out so I wanted to be super prepared. I was able to drink a little over half of the gallon of GoLYTELY mixed with just water and flavored individually with each cup taken. It was by far the easiest prep I’ve had to do. The taste wasn’t horrific like a previous product I used and there was no pain associated with this prep. With this being said . I will finish the other half of the prep around 7pm since my test isn’t until tomorrow at 11am, this combined with no food and only clear liquids I’m hoping that I did ok and didn’t start too early. The only advice I would give is be careful if you have to cough (be on the toilet) and flavor with orange flavored crystal light packs as needed. I didn’t have mine cold either, I did it at room temperature.",Et

8,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 18, 2020",24,"This product GoLYTELY tasted exactly like drinking ocean water, a sickening experience.  It seems there has to be a way for the manufacturer to neutralize the salt and give this product a palatable taste.  I did mix it with ice, water and Crystal Light lemonade making it tolerable but that increased 1 gal to approx 1.5gal. I cannot consume 1 gal in 7-8hrs let alone half again as much. Surely there must be plans to stop torturing patients.  I have not met anyone who could stand this stuff and it seems that the proscribers have never bothered to taste it.",Frieda

12,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 31, 2020",14,Took GoLytely as directed  for a bowel prep and it did not work.  I started drinking the prep at 5pm and by the 6 am the  following morning I still had not had a bowel movement and I did not urinate for 24 hours. I contacted the so called professionals at the hospital and they were not concerned that it did not work. Their advice was to drink 2 gallons of GoLytely. Most people can barely get 1 gallon down let alone 2. So rather than address why the prep did not work they just ignored it. GoLytely might work for you but it didn't do anything for me.,Huckabee
13,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,1.0,,"February 26, 2020",21,"I had golytely split prep (1/2 night before, remaining, morning of). I mixed it with lemonade mix and it wasn't bad. The evening was fine. I followed the directions and all went well. I had prepared days in advance with very light foods and lots of fluids. With in 4 hours all discharge was completely clear. Went to sleep and woke up an hour later with an excruciating headache, vomiting, trembling and chills. This went on all night. Could not complete the morning prep at all as my stomach lurched when I touched the jug! Still vomiting a bit and headache when I arrived for the procedure. That went fine but now I am 12 hours post procedure, still have a slight headache and a very nauseous stomach. How long does the effects of this remain?? Time will tell I suppose. Take a hard pass on this prep folks!!! There are much less severe options available.",Anonymous
14,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,7.0,,"February 16, 2020",36,"This was my second colonoscopy. For my first, the prep was a Miralax prep, this second one was Golytely. I'm an RN, and the difference between the two was markedly different.  The Golytley sat in my stomach for the first couple of hours, then it started to work. Too well. I had a couple of accidents without warning. But I'll say this for it: once you begin, you are determined to finish so you don't have to repeat it. There was no real covering the taste, which I compare to salty plastic. I did not experience any nausea. With the Miralax, my tummy actually felt better for a week or so. Not so with the Golytely, which has left me feeling a little inflamed. I think I also cleared better with the Miralax. When it's time to repeat the procedure, I will decline the Golytely prep in favor of the Miralax if possible.Overall, it isn't the end of the world. But this kind of prep is the reason that many people avoid this life-saving procedure.",starri

The taste of the prep wasn't too bad, I added some flavored lemonade packets to the mix along with lemon flavor that came with it. Super cold helped. I did take three Dulcolax tablets the night before as well and that helped a lot. It took approximately 2.5 hours from the time I started drinking it until everything came out looking like light yellow water. Debating waking up to do the rest at 2:00 am though. ... lol.

16,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,,,"September 24, 2019",16,"Thought it is tastes like water with a hint of salt and a soap-like aftertaste, I found that using a straw towards the back of your throat and quickly getting it down helps. Then, a sip of Gatorade or ginger ale to get the residual taste out helps.

17,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 30, 2019",36,"This worked perfectly. My directions were to drink half the bottle at 4 PM, and then the other half five hours before my scheduled arrival time for the procedure which was 7 AM. I followed the directions to the T,  but nothing happened after the first half of the prep.  It did the second though. However my stool was not absolutely clear and still had residue in it at the last movement. I was worried so took a picture and brought it in to the surgery center where the nurse told me that’s absolutely what they looked for, yellow almost clear with sediment. So don’t get discouraged if you are still passing a little bit of sediment. I would recommend to also drink additional fluids. I put 3 envelopes of crystal light lemonade in the jug and it tasted EXACTLY like lemonade poured over ice. Had NO problem drinking it down.",Fitzgerald
18,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,10.0,,"July 17, 2019",19,"I did the GoLytely prep and not Miralax because it has the electrolytes and there is evidence that it does a better job at bowel lavage. Take 4 tablespoons of olive oil orally hours prior to prep. There are studies out of Turkey and Mexico showing that Olive Oil produces a better prep, especially in the right colon. Eat a low residue diet for days beforehand. Switch to smoothies 24 hours before the procedure. Have your colonoscopy in the afternoon, and start your prep in the early morning. I stopped having smoothies before bedtime, and started prep at 4am. Want to help your GoLytely go down easily? Mix 6 fluid ounces of prep with 2 fluid ounces of clear broth. The prep is salty and you'll only taste broth. Warm it up! Make it cozy. Have coconut water in between glasses of prep. Between my diarrhea and these tips, I needed a liter of prep. And I got a 9 for my bowel cleanliness. Results may vary!",Devorah
19,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 19, 2019",12,I had the 2 day 2 liter a day instructions. I weigh 120 lbs. Maybe I shouldn’t have drank most of it. I didn’t get that instruction to stop when discharge was clear.  Half way through the second 2 liters I started to have constant cramping pain across my stomach and back. By the time I dragged myself to the office they made the decision to take me by wheelchair to the Emergency Room. I was admitted and given morphine. Some of my labs were slightly elevated but all in all I am healthy. It really was a horrible experience and embarrassing. I was an idiot in the doctors office with all the moaning. AND they had me wait over 10 minutes before someone saw me. I’m wondering if someone had the same reaction.,Connie

22,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 16, 2019",13,"I've used this prep twice: The first time I drank it as prepared in the container and followed the instructions: Drink 3L within 3 hours. After about 2 1/2L the nausea became too much...it felt like my body was refusing to allow the prep to leave my stomach the right way, and I ended up vomiting what seemed like an entire litre. The next morning I tried to drink the remaining 1L, but again I started vomiting.The next time I used lemon for the prep and ginger ale to wash my mouth out, and I decided to extend the 3 hours to 4. That helped in giving the prep a tolerable taste, and I didn't feel rushed to gulp the solution, but regardless, after 1 1/2L my stomach said 'no more' and I began vomiting copious amounts. The next morning I managed to drink only 2/3L. The fact is, for some Golytely is just not a viable option - for whatever reason the body won't tolerate it. With the nausea and headache the next morning, I felt like I had literally poisoned my body. I know I will NEVER use it again",Fifi

25,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2019",12,"I was given the unflavored 4 liter bottle of GoLytely for colonoscopy prep and the split protocol (drink half at suppertime the night before and the other half 6 hrs before arrival). I was told I could add sugar-free lemonade Crystal Light (no other options permitted). The prep itself worked as expected, despite the fact that I was only able to drink 2/3 of the total volume. I developed SEVERE nausea after the first phase of the prep and had to quit 2 glasses into the second phase. The super-salty flavor wasn't the problem -- I think it was the huge volume consumed quickly and the strong plastic odor/taste of the solution. I did not get dehydrated or dizzy (drank LOTS of fluids), so I think this stuff is the ticket if I can figure out how to beat the nausea.",Rathernot Say
26,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 25, 2019",20,"I had used Golytely as prep for a colonoscopy. I was required to drink 2 liters between 4-6pm and another 2 liters @ midnight. That’s a lot of liquid. I don’t think I could drink that much of something I loved. Needless to say, I couldn’t get through the first two liters and ended up canceling my procedure because my system was not sufficiently flushed. The taste wasn’t an intense or gross taste—at first. But as I kept drinking, it began to taste like salt water. My body naturally decided that drinking two liters of this stuff was too much and I began vomiting. This was meant to be my second colonoscopy, but my first time using Golytely as the prep. Very disappointed in this stuff and the fact that there are doctors who still use this 4-liter prep approach, when, apparently, there are much better and lesser-volume options available.",MiFii87

Fifth, have some really soft toilet paper ready.   A lot of toilet paper.Overall, it wasn’t the worst thing I have had to do, but it is in definitely on the list.

Adding the flavor only seems to intensify the salty taste  I divided the drink up in the 4 quart containers and drank 1 at a time much easier to do.  Drink  it through a straw.  You have less chance of becoming nauseous . I coated my rump as  as suggested by others  who had the prep. It really helped. P.S.  Thank you to all the people who offered suggestions it really helped.  I also drank the prep at room temperature and chilled.  The only difference was at room temperature it was a little bit more salty. If you’ve ever mixed baking soda and water for heartburn  that’s what this prep reminded me of but, actually tasted better.  It was not horrible. At the end I replenished with Gatorade. I also had 3 more clear BM’s the next day  which was the morning of my procedure.

51,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,9.0,,"July 16, 2015",39,"Worked as expected. No solid food after dinner two nights before procedure day, clear liquids only, began at 6:00pm, then chased each glass of prep with ginger ale on ice for taste. Important to use straw with prep; helps bypass the taste on tongue. Residual cleansing continued into the night for several hours, but not too inconvenient.",Subaruowner
52,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 26, 2015",55,This was much easier than expected. First I went on low fiber diet two days before taking it. One day (from mednight ) before procedure I went on clear liquid diet with no solid food. Then took GL at about 6 PM. No reaction until seventh 8 ounce glass of GL. Then it did the job it's designed to do. No pains or cramps. The solution was cold and I got each glass down as fast as comfortably possible. Taste? I didn't notice anything bad about it and did not add any flavoring. It's like drinking a lot of water. Maybe they should have a beer flavor to make it go down even easier.,GeorgeTheFirst
53,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,,,"July 29, 2014",26,I had rectal cancer and a rectal resection in 2012.  Used MoviePrep and Half Lytely with no problem.  Two years have passed and I experience nausea more frequently than before and I am unable to finish even a third of the Pineapple flavored GoLytely.  So bad.  Salty pineapple whoo whew.,go not
54,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,7.0,,"March 13, 2013",34,"I dunked it with out ice, awful taste, But when I put ice and lemon in it, it was awesome, just like lemonade. I strongly recommend ice in your glass. By the way those powders that comes with it, they are very sweet and doesn't taste good but ice and lemons is the best. It is a lot of drink, I did it in 2 days after 5.",Gulyt

56,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,9.0,,"December 4, 2012",44,Wonderful prep. Had slight abdomen pain towards the end. It did exactly what it was meant for. It really was not bad at all!! The only reason it didn't get a ten was because it was a lot to drink. I chugged some. Sipped it. And it took 4 hours to finish but I like this because you do it at your own pace. And once you are empty. No more loose stools!,Anonymous
57,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,10.0,,"December 27, 2011",29,"I had stomach cramps within minutes of starting my first glass of Golytely and started my first bowel movement before I could even finish my first glass! Aside from the nasty taste and the stomach cramps, I have to say this really works. I think my colon will be completely clear for the colonoscopy tomorrow morning at the rate I'm going and that's saying a lot since I'm disabled and have zero control down there in that area.",Dreamyr0304
58,GoLYTELY,Bowel Preparation,3.0,,"April 6, 2011",33,"It was just barely drinkable and you have to drink a huge amount of it. In my case, there no effect for hours and hours and I felt totally bloated. It finally started working, but I didn't feel as fully emptied out as I would have liked by the time of my procedure in the morning. I had followed instructions to the letter, including the dietary instructions the day before.",Not effective
