0,Urea Cream,Dermatological Disorders,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 1, 2021",0,"I make your own!  I mix 20% of urea (by weight) into Sorbolene ($2.99 for 500ml), The Urea will dissolves in the Sorbolene cream overnight. I shake it up to make sure that the dissolved Urea is mixed well. I then use it as a moisturizer. It works great for me. This information is from my experience only. I am not recommending that you make your own. If you happen to do so, I take no responsibly or liability for any negative affects this mixture may have on you.",Houndogharry
1,Urea Cream,Dermatological Disorders,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 26, 2020",0,Nutraplus (urea):I too had a problem with itchy skin on my arms and was permanently scratching until I was referred to the dermatologist. After trying a few different topical applications he prescribed this one and it was like magic!  That was 3 years ago.  Now because it was more than two years the gp is not allowed to repeat the prescription - and I cannot buy it anywhere.I believe it might be available from France or New Zealand online - has anyone any knowledge of buying medications from abroad?,Carol

5,Urea Cream,Dermatological Disorders,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 24, 2018",6,My 9 year old son has a condition shared by my mother where there are not enough pores in his feet so when he sweats his feet peel similar to a sunburn. Over the summer his feet had gotten so bad he could hardly walk and he developed and infection in the skin and had dry peeling and deeply cracked feet. He has been on the prescription cream for one week and already had significant improvement. Almost all of the peeling skin is gone and the new skin remains soft and playable. Waiting for follow up after week 2 and interested to see how he responds if taken off the end. Since I apply the cream to his feet myself I notice my palms are newer and improved skin even though I wash after each application.,Sports mom
6,Urea Cream,Dermatological Disorders,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 24, 2016",5,"Rea Lo 40 (urea):One application on alternating days in conjunction with fluocinonide topical for two weeks. After bath and thorough foot scrub, apply Rea Lo or fluocinonide first, then regular lotion (I use Vanicream), then occlude with wet wrap therapy method (saran wrap was suggested as alternative, but I found wet wrap much more comfortable to sleep with: put damp socks on over treated feet, then dry socks over damp socks to keep). Great improvement early on, I expect improvement continued, but was less evident in second week. Treatment completed until eczema flares up again. Also helped hands substantially, even though I used less intensive application.",Mrtilman
7,Urea Cream,Dermatological Disorders,10,,"September 14, 2016",17,"Have been using this product since the beginning of 2016.  I suffer from plaque psoriasis on the palms of my hands and bottoms of my feet, they were cracked, cut open, weeping and bleeding.  Everytime I closed or tried to close my hands they cracked and opened more.  My feet were bad I could barely stand shoes, and they itched.  I went to Dr. was given Prednisone and cortisone cream, it helped but after 2 weeks of using Urea 40 things started clearing nicely, I use it twice daily along with Glysolid cream.  These two products have been my saving grace.  If I have a flare up, these are my go to guys.",Luis Mae
