1,Clobetasol,Dermatological Disorders,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 9, 2018",5,"I had this incredibly itchy rash on my right shin. It became raised and beet red. Dermatologist D.O. (only derm around me) had no idea, nor did my PCP or Rheum drs. It went on for months. It took the Derm's DO's PA to finally dx me with Chronic Venous Insufficiency. It wasn't just a rash on the outside. It was coming from the inside. The veins in my legs where having great difficulty pumping my blood back up my legs. I elevate a lot, getting my legs above my heart.Who knew that a rash, the itchiest I've ever had, was related to my blood flow! I think there are others out there with the same thing that's going undiagnosed. Clobetasol and elevation are the only tools right now to deal with this. My insurance just took Clobetasol off it's formulary. Now I have to pony up the cash every month to keep me from wanting to cut the skin off. Thank God for Clobetasol and a really good PA who finally dx it!",Legomom
2,Clobetasol,Dermatological Disorders,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 16, 2017",3,"I had this strange itchy condition on my legs and sometimes forearms.  The Dermatologist gave this to me after I tried over the counter that didn't work.  I don't think this works much better than the neosporin ""cream"" (not gel).  The Neosporin gives me immediate relief it just doesn't last long. Jury is out with this stuff. I put on for first time last night but still had bouts of itching on corners of foot, ankle, thigh and forearms.  I am not sure what is going on with me. I live in California and hike a lot.  I get scaly red itchy top of ankles and slight rashy bumps on legs Itches like crazy then will subside.  I now have sores from scratching.  With all the reviews I thought I'd get an obvious result of something - I don't feel much different.  I still itch. So this isn't much better than my neosporin cream I use.",Sydney0502

I wish I ask for help earlier!",doesn't matter
