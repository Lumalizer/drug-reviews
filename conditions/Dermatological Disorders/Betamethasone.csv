1,Betamethasone,Dermatological Disorders,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 20, 2019",2,"I suffer from a painful, red rash on my upper chest.  I used to use sulfacetamide that worked well but my insurance company removed it from their coverage and the price went up from a few $ to more than $300 for a small bottle.  Accordingly, I switched to betamethezone and it works just as well.  So does an elemental sulfur-containing cream, but it was too effective and resulted in mild chemical burns.",Mactheknife
2,Betamethasone,Dermatological Disorders,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 13, 2018",10,Hive and rash covered my full body and this seem to be the only topical that reduced the itch and my hive and rash were gone in 9days.,Kedo
3,Betamethasone,Dermatological Disorders,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 27, 2018",18,"Diprosone (betamethasone):I have had odd eczema on-and-off for about 3 years. I tried 7 different hand creams before finally visiting my GP. He wasn't sure if my condition even was a classic case of eczema, as it was not like the majority of other patients' he had seen: mine was itchy every night, red, dry and flaky, and in distinct circle shapes on the back of my left hand. Sometimes, it bled.Scabies cream did not work for me, so I was prescribed Diprosone. My extremely uncomfortable ""eczema"" had disappeared after about a week of applying a thin layer of the cream, twice daily.It has left slightly pale patches on my hand where the condition used to be, but my skin is back to normal and there are no more irritating symptoms (like itching), ever.I would highly recommend this cream for anyone with a similar condition.",rammsteiner
4,Betamethasone,Dermatological Disorders,8.0,,"June 23, 2017",10,"Our daughter mistakenly touched a halogen light bulb and easily received a bad burn. ..Red and blistered. Aloe vera did not help but when this cream was applied,  the pain disappeared within 5 minutes.  She was able to take a nap and when she woke up, she was back to a normal 5 yr old without any pain from the burn.  NOTE: We are living in Indonesia and a local person told us about this solution. Purchased a 15 gr. tube at the pharmacy for $3.50 USD w/o a prescription.  Using this cream caused no burn scarring on a treated burn according to the local person suggesting it.We will use maybe once or twice and then treat for normal burn until the affected area has returned to normal. Not needed long term.",JMC55
5,Betamethasone,Dermatological Disorders,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 24, 2016",27,"I've had eczema all my life,  at 24 it now comes in flare ups every now and then generally when the weather changes or other allergies I.e hay-fever that go hand in hand.  I've used probably most things on the market,  from oily emollients to creams and I seem to have settled with this. Other creams don't have the date effect this does its easy to apply doesn't feel greasy and soaks in quickly..  But it is the only cream that really works.  Big eczema flare ups are dealt with in days as opposed to weeks previously and it stops the urge to itch..  Honestly if you suffer with eczema you need to make sure you have this it's a must.",Danny UK Manchester
