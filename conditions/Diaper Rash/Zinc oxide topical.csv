0,Zinc oxide topical,Diaper Rash,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 24, 2019",8,Boudreaux Butt Paste (zinc oxide):Used this butt paste for my daughters diaper rash. Within 30 mins she couldn’t even sit down. The butt paste made her butt and vaginal area super red that I couldn’t even bath her without her screaming in pain. I used Desitin Max strength and it immediately started working and helped her.  I threw away the butt paste.,Cassie
1,Zinc oxide topical,Diaper Rash,10,,"March 19, 2013",7,My baby has extremely sensitive skin..one day after picking her up from the babysitters she had a severe diaper rash..shes had problems with eczema and diaper rashes since she was born..I am still trying to find out if maybe the diaper rashes can be caused from milk..I have tried everything. Frustrated and desperate to find something that would help my baby girl feel better I was introduced to Zinc Oxide my aunt swore it works so I tried it!! MIRACLE CREAM I CALL IT!  It worked when nothing else would and within 1 day my baby's rash went from SEVERE TO MILD...IT WAS LIKE NIGHT AND DAY! MY BABY IS HAPPIER NOW.,booboolina
