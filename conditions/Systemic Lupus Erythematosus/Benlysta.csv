0,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 9, 2022",1,"I have been on Benlysta for only 6 weeks now but can already notice a difference in my fatigue and joint pain! I have so much more energy and am no longer dying for a nap each afternoon or sleeping more than 8-9 hours a night. I can exercise again without my knees swelling or the joints in my feet aching for days afterwards. I want to say that other people's reviews about the shot being painful scared me before I started, but I don't think it hurts at all! I leave it out for an hour and autoinject it into my stomach. Just a brief pinch! I was able to get the Benlysta copay grant program to cover up to $15,000 in deductible fees per year which made it possible for me to go on this medication. I am not low income, but middle class with rubbish insurance I would not have able to justify / pay my $9,000 deductible with accruing debt. The program approved me within a hour of filling out a 15 minute online application. So to anyone who thinks they can't afford it, look into that program!",Rock528
1,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 22, 2022",0,"Benlysta is the only medication that helps with my level 3 lupus, it gives me relief of swelling, pain and overall fatigue. While the first day I am sluggish the next day I feel like an energizer bunny, the only down fall is that it doesn’t last for an entire month and I can only have this medication every 4 weeks. Overall I am very pleased with this drug and grateful for it",Ivette Ruiz
2,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 11, 2021",0,"Benlysta has completely changed my life. It’s been almost a year of treatments and my quality of life is so much better than before. Initially I was really scared to start the infusions, and I was very nervous about side effects. I still get fatigue, headache and a bit of nausea for 2 days after my infusions now but it’s so worth it in exchange for everything I’m able to do with ease now",ABerg95
3,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 13, 2021",17,"I'm on the autoinjector form of Benlysta.  Unlike all the other reviewers, I don't think the injection is in any way painful.  Leave the injector out of the fridge for a couple of hours so it can warm up.  Let the alcohol wiped area dry before injecting.  I inject in my upper thigh and feel no pain if I've followed my above rules.  I've been on Benlysta now for 9 weeks and I'm not feeling a huge improvement but I have been able to get off prednisone.  I'm going to give it a full 12 weeks before I get discouraged.  My lupus is causing terrible brain fog, fatigue, joint and muscle pain.  Blood work is still pretty bad but I'm not giving up just yet.  I haven't noticed any side effects.",Brute
4,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,5.0,,"May 13, 2021",4,"I have SLE and SS. My main issues are extreme fatigue and brain fog.I have given myself 3 injections so far; one in stomach and one in each leg. It hurts, no lie. But the pain only last about 20-30 seconds (seems like forever!) It hurts less in the stomach, but harder to do if you have belly fat like me!So far, my issues are in the mental side. A couple of days I felt paranoia, not normal for me. I’ve cried easily on some days, happy or sad. One day I felt super negative, like nothing was gonna ever work. Weird stuff like that. I’m aware of it, so it is like watching myself from the outside. Anyways, I’m still fatigued with brain fog but I’m staying hopeful that this will work for me over time. Also, I was already forgetful but I seem a little more than usual. My insurance covers part of the cost and I am on a program that covers my co-pay for one year. I hope it helps you and me too!",Hope

I have been doing the weekly injections for almost three years and I have not had a single flare since I've been on it. It has also put my Hypocomplementemic Urticaria Vasculitis in remission and has kept it in remission.,KayeElleBea

I do feel a little better but not much. I suffer from depression/ADHD and for the past 2 years my depression medication isn't working. I had sepsis last year and had to have surgery.

7,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,3.0,,"March 19, 2021",2,I was taking benlysta for three year. I started  with the infusion for about a year. Then was put on the injection once a week. It does burn a lot the first 6 treatment but the it ease up a lot. But about 7 months in taking the injectable benlysta my legs started to feel very weak and heavy. I told my rheumatologist . Told me stop it for a few weeks. But I started back on benlysta . I change my rheumatologist I stop taking the drug. But the leg weakness never left. My legs hurt all time .,Apple head
8,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,6.0,,"December 19, 2020",9,"Monthly IV Benlysta for decreased symptoms fairly well for 2-3 years. Gradually, it wore off as I got closer to my next infusion. After 5 1/2 years, I switched to weekly SQ injection. Both IV & SQ caused foggy head, headaches, GI upset for a couple of days.  SQ auto inject is difficult & painful to administer. It is absurd that they would make a drug so hard to grip and hold when the people using it have joint problems. I stopped using it after 2 months. I gradually realized 10 months after discontinuing Benlysta that a huge depression was lifted. I am prone to depression so I thought it had been just me, but now that I’m off Benlysta I feel so much better mentally, even though my pain is worse without treatment. Overall, I think Benlysta IV is a better than SQ and it does help, at least for the first 2-3 years, but to be used with caution in people with a history of depression.",Grounded for Reading
9,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 25, 2020",10,Benlysta completely changed my life. Almost immediately after my first infusion I suddenly had energy again and could actually attend social gatherings without feeling sick for days after. I’ve been on it for more than two years now and the effects have remained. I still have some lupus issues related to brain fog and joint pain but all in all I feel so much better since starting Benlysta,Beth
10,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 25, 2020",26,"I have been on Benlysta almost 4 years and it has worked great for my Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Before that I was taking hydroxychloroquine which made me so nauseous and stomach cramps that I had to stop taking it.  Benlysta is very well tolerated, just very fatigued the next day.  The first infusion really hit me hard with flare up symptoms but then I got so much better after that .  No longer need wheelchair .  Only need walker if I overdo it .  The swollen painful joints are gone, the energy significantly improved (unless I overdo it). I am still careful to respect my physical limits and avoid my triggers .",PAC1016

I used to be fatigued, I could hardly function, but it has given me some energy back. It also helps the pain so much! I give myself the injection once a week, and I'm with some of you.. it hurts soooo bad. Luckily it's not that long, but it really hurts. I have to psych myself up to do it. I've heard it doesn't hurt as much in the belly, but I cannot bring myself to do it. It's worth the pain though, because it has really helped me!",Ren

13,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 8, 2020",79,"I found out that if you inject Benlysta in the stomach is less painful. If you take the medication out of the refrigerator for 4 hours (the med can be as much as 12 hours out after that it has to de disposed) before injection time it will be less painful when the liquid enters in your system. Put the medication away from light hot or cold and then inject. If you are injecting in yourself do it very slowly with the prefill one but not the auto inject. The auto inject will release the med very fast and it's very painful. I been using it for 5 years now. Still have a lot of joint pain but the fatigue, the brain fog and the other symptoms are much better. I hope this info can help and Bless someone.",Lina

Therefore, I would say I am not receiving 2/3 of the injection. No I don’t want to get monthly infusions at this time. I hope in the future alternatives are available or the prefilled injectors are made to deliver a less painful Experience.",Deb c

I’m currently on plaquinil, steroids and Cell-Cept. I have lived with severe pain in my joins and my spine. I just did my second injection (I inject once per week). Right now, I cannot get out of my own way. I have no energy and no drive to do anything. Having to inject once per week, am I going to feel like this forever or do these symptoms of exhaustion going to get better? I can deal with the headaches and such but this brain fog and lack of energy is really bothersome.",Jojo
16,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 22, 2020",25,"I started with infusions. Never had a bad experience. My body felt cooler inside. I switched to AI (auto injector)for convenience. Same thing. I feel good. My bloodwork looks totally normal. After years with a positive ANA, this last test showed negative. My inflammation markers were normal. I really surprised. No side effects. My insurance will not pay for auto injections this year so I’m going back to infusions. I still have bad fatigue but I also have Psa, plaque psoriasis, Celiac, Hashimoto’s, and primary hyperparathyroidism. Oh I have sicca syndrome or Sjogrens. I believe the Hashimoto’s is causing my issues. Overall, great experience but it’s ridiculously expensive.",Muffinandme
17,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 6, 2020",17,"I have been on Benlysta for 7 years, still taking plaquenil and Imuran for LN. I was diagnosed at 14 years old with primary lung, heart involvement; however, the following years SLE progressed to bone, renal, skin, and brain involvement. Since being on Benslyta, I’ve not had a flare nor been on steroids, which in my past have wreaked havoc on my bones, resulting in hip failure/ AVN at a young age. My C3, C4 compliment levels have been normal for the past 5-6 years. My anti-DS DNA levels are <5 at times! I initially began with the Benlysta IV monthly infusions, which left me so fatigued >24 hrs afterwards. Since switching to the pre-filled syringes, I can resume my normal activities within an hour. I find that my abdomen is easier for injecting than my leg. I tried the auto-injector pens but It was more painful. I’m just curious why an insurance would require someone to return to monthly infusions, increasing the change for infection, human error, erroneous/ improper constitution, etc.",E
18,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 26, 2019",23,For me benlysta has saved my sanity. My lupus causes mini strokes. Before benlysta my mini strokes were at least once a week lasting upwards of 15 minutes each. Since starting benlysta my mini strokes are down to max of twice a month last at most a minute. I did have a port put in and started receiving my infusions that way instead of being stuck every month. Best decision yet. I don't have to worry anymore about hitting my vein the first time. I have never had a side effect. The only thing that a person would consider based is the next couple days after treatment I am weak. Which to me is a small sacrifice compared to the positive of this treatment. Now for insurance I have Medicare and a medigap. So I never paid out of pocket. Not even for the port to be put in.,Emeraldheart
19,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10.0,,"October 23, 2019",64,"I was diagnosed with lupus at 17 years old. I was in excruciating pain, debilitating fatigue and a horrific rash on my face (malar rash as it turned out). Even with a positive ANA (with the pattern suggestive of lupus), a ridiculously high ESR and CRP and my obvious symptoms. The doctors didn’t want to act on my condition. It wasn’t until my treatment for rosacea failed that my dermatologist did a skin biopsy that confirmed my diagnosis. Once on treatment, nothing really worked. I stayed on the Plaquenil (til this date) for fear of coming off even though I don’t get much relief. I’ve been on Benlysta since 2013 and it has changed my life. It’s a miracle drug and I recommend everyone to give it a fair shot. I was skeptical too but it’s completely changed my life and allowed me to live a full life. At time of diagnosis, I couldn’t even dress myself from the debilitating pain.",Sunshine

21,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 16, 2019",36,"I've had mild to moderate SLE for 17 years; been on plaquenil for most of that time, and for the past 8 years I've been getting a quarterly steroid injection. During that time I'd feel mostly okay joint-wise for two months then start to go downhill until the next injection. Definitely a roller coaster existence. Other treatments (methotrexate, Embrel) didn't help. I started Benlysta about 7 months ago, and the difference in my energy level is astounding. While I'm not my old self, I can at least see a reflection of my old self. It hasn't helped my joint pain much, but I'm able to do regular exercise again. My social life has also picked up because I'm not exhausted after work every day. I get rashes at the injection site (I take the weekly injections), and the shots feel like a wasp sting, but they are worth it.",Strix

After 1.5 years on infusions I started the self infections at home due to blown veins at each infusion. The only side effect I've had is very consistent weight gain.

23,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 29, 2018",25,"I am 69 years old and was diagnosed with SLE 2 1/2 years ago. Prior to lupus I had Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome for years and took Plaquenil for 18 months and stopped it for retinal issues. After stopping Plaquenil I was prescribed weekly oral methotrexate, which after 4 years gave me debilitating diarrhea and we stopped it. I had my first infusion of Benlysta one week ago and I felt better than I have in years. My premedications were oralTylenol and IV Benadryl and Solucortef. The only side effects I noticed were waking up with a headache the first night and some mild dizziness that I still have occasionally. Most nights I don’t have pain, but when I do the opioid covers it. I have been taking prednisone 15 mg daily since the March flare and am hoping to be able to taper it off. The prednisone has caused a 15 pound weight gain and I have 3+ pitting edema in my thighs. Overall I would definitely recommend Benlysta to another person wIth SLE.",smc130

With my first treatment I was extremely tired and the next day my mind was forgetful and foggy.  I am pre-medicated with Tylenol and Benadryl with each infusion.  I have noticed a big difference in my joint pain and fatigue.  I would not say that it is completely gone however there is a vast difference.  I still take a low dose of prednisone and plaquenil.

I am so so very thankful to feel almost normal most days....However, this last months infusion, I am still having joint pain... I read that someone else had this experience... where they worked every month except for one. It makes me wonder if there is room for error in administering the drug.

I got a very bad headache for the first 24 hours after infusions but after that my joint pain and fatigue improved immensely. Two months ago the infusion nurse was not able to start my IV & recommended that I go on benlysta subcutaneously. I was told by my insurance company, which is Medicare, that because they could not get an IV in me this would be fully covered. Much to my Devastation and shock I found out that this was not covered and the cost is $1,158 per month. This is outrageous and more than what my SSDI payment is per month! In addition, cost aside, the injection is extremely painful. It's almost impossible to give the full amount because of how painful it is. My thigh burns all day after giving my self the autoinjection and is bruised and feels like I've been punched for about 5 days later. I don't feel the same relief that I felt with IV.",Deena Marie

I had one really bad 3-month flare this year but my rheumatologist kept on top of it.  I felt the drug go through my entire body for the first 8 infusions. No kidding. Lightheaded, metallic taste in my mouth and a little woozy. I always drove myself to and from infusions and went directly home to rest afterwards, as it made me very groggy within a hour. If you are sensitive to drugs, have someone drive you. I experienced diarrhea a few hours after infusions for the first year. You must take an antihistamine before being infused.",Lupie13

I really hate the thought of pumping something into my veins that may or may not damage some other part of my body or kill me; but sometimes you have to get past your fears and pray for the best outcome. I've heard that a positive outlook can be 80%  of the healing process. I was diagnosed with SLE in 2002. I started on plaquenil  and steriods. Over the years I have been on medications that were later recalled due to multiple deaths. That really makes you think and feel as though you are the drug company's guinea pig.

44,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 29, 2014",42,"Worked very well, controlled symptoms and put me in remission. Felt like I did 20 years ago - pre SLE and Siscoid Lupus diagnosis!I had a serious anaphylaxis reaction after my 3rd infusion from not being premedicated by my previous rheumatologist.  Changed physicians and continued treatment with pre-medication of Benedryl and Solumedrol in i.v.  It worked for 5 treatments and then I had a reaction a 2nd time and was removed from the infusions.Doctors say had I been premedicated from the very beginning, I more than likely would not have had a reaction.My remission is now over and I am worse than prior to Benlysta treatment.Benlysta co-pay program paid for 100% of my deductible, as well as $7,000 in co-pays each year",OmaLaura

I've been taking Benlysta for one year now and notice a big difference in my body.  I have more energy before taking the medicine I suffered greatly from fatigue.  I feel little to no joint or muscular pain, before the medicine I suffered from severe inflammation and swelling in my joints and could hardly walk some days.  I now jog on my treadmill, go to Zumba classes and workout at Curves.  The medicine has been a God send for me and I'm so grateful for the opportunity to witness to this great invention.   The only downfall is my insurance will only cover 80% which leave me a hefty 800.00 balance each moth.  I'm on disability and cannot afford this expense.",Jalpurnia Trader

47,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 8, 2013",39,"I have been using Benlysta since April and it is doing wonders for me. Some mornings I tried but couldn't get out of bed but not any more. I sleep well and have energy. My only problem is the weight gain. I started with every two weeks for 2 months and then once a  month. When I just started the medication I used to feel a funny feeling in my mouth, not anymore.",Quennieflowers
48,Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 13, 2012",67,"First infusion  - experienced swelling everywhere (inside and out), two days after infusion. Day 1 had a migraine like headache (Light sensitivity), fatigue, some heart rhythm issue (temporary) and temporary voice changes. I was pre-dosed with Tylenol.Second infusion  - pre dosed with Benadryl and solumedrol, very slight swelling, headaches coming on now (I was told: Literature says these headaches will improve with subsequent infusions), less heart involvement, I tried to sleep through most of the infusion time (1 1/2 - 2 hours with prep). I was blessed to be accepted by the HEALTHWELL FOUNDATION where I applied for co-pay assistance.  ",GERDed
