0,Prednisone,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,6,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 17, 2020",6,"So I had SLE when I was 18 years old which was back in January 2018. Ever since that day, I started eating prednisolone at a dose of 60mg. It did help however, I hated the side effects. It ruined my teenager years. I had stretch marks, moon face, buffalo hump, and gain over 23 pounds. So, I became obese and just like that. I really hated the first few months of prednisolone not to mention I had chubby cheeks and my face looked like it got beat up. My cheeks were big that it made my eyes and nose seem smaller. After 6 months, my doc slowly started reducing the dose and now it’s been a year since I’ve been eating prednisolone at a dose of 10mg. I mean I’m glad that the side effects will gradually disappear but, I wouldn’t want to experience this nightmare ever again.",Ruby

3,Prednisone,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,7,,"May 28, 2014",17,"This medication does work great. However, the side effects are no fun. It cause weight gain, mood swings, and a host of other side effects. If the bad side effects were not there, I would definitely stay on this medication, because it helps so much with the pain and all of the other medical conditions that Lupus can cause.",small town mom
4,Prednisone,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,9,,"April 1, 2011",25,"Immediately made me feel like a new person! Helped me walk ""normal"" again, and go down stairs without horrible pain. Made my hands and feet swelling improve greatly. My hands were squishy, my feet were so swollen I couldn't fit in my shoes, and my toes looked like little sausages. Like any other medication there was side effects, of course moon face, weight gain, hair loss and horrible taste but I would do it all over again because it helped me so much with pain, swelling and is continuing to help me live normal. Yay for prednisone.",Jendoo
5,Prednisone,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,6,,"December 6, 2009",29,"I was diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus after about 3 months of tests and suffering at the age of 14. Not long after that I had a terrible episode and had to be hospitalized. I was put on 40mg. The side effects are horrible. I got the ""chipmunk cheeks"" or ""moon face"", I lost a lot of hair, I had extra hair in weird places, I had terrible insomnia, and I had a lot of water retention. People that I knew didn't recognize me. I was then lowered too quickly off prednisone and got an even worse episode. I was put on 100mg and it was horrible! But prednisone did save my life. I have long term effects like osteopenia, lowered immunity and stomach problems. I am now 34, been on it 20 yrs! Saved my life. There were no other options when they put you on Prednisone.",dayday
