0,Hydroxychloroquine,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 10, 2021",1,The generic Hydroxychloroquine made me ill and hospitalized. The coating is different than  the brand drug. Prasco labs had an authorized generic of Plaqunil they sold until COVID that was reasonably priced but they removed it and now my only option is the brand Plaquenil which costs me a fortunate in a monthly basis. I wish these companies would not play games with our health. Since COVID the price on Plaquenil has also increased. I wish they would help an average American than needs this medication at a reasonable price. Very disappointed.,Plaqunil

2,Hydroxychloroquine,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 24, 2021",0,"I was put on hydroxychloroquine for my lupus and arthritis. I have pain mostly in my upper back, neck and shoulders and left arm, wrist, and hand. I was prescribed to take two 200mg pills once a day. I took it only twice and my reaction was beyond terrible It started off with a rash on my stomach which later spread to my entire body. Little did I know I would be in for the worst 2 1/2 months of my life. See with this medication the half life is so long that one pill stays in your system for at least 40 days. So this rash was with me for weeks and weeks on end. I had to be put on prednisone for my severe reaction (which caused weight gain and severe permanent stretch marks). The rash made it impossible to shower, I couldn't sleep, my skin was peeling everywhere, I was hospitalized for anaphylaxis. I cried for hours everyday. I wanted to die. Never again! Please get tested for allergies before ever using this medication if you want to be seriously safe. I am scarred for life!",Mar
3,Hydroxychloroquine,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 4, 2021",5,Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine):Started plaquenil a little over 30 days ago. I was so excited because I started to have more energy very early on. About a week in I did a bunch of stuff at my mothers house —outside!!—-and didn’t have to go hide in a hole for 3 days to recover. I started rethinking my whole life again. I thought maybe I could go back to school or work…. Life could be normal again?I thought too soon. The last three weeks have been a whirlwind of negative thinking and random outbursts. I rarely get mad at anyone and found myself annoyed at the whole world. The final straw was a visit from my grandson. I was so irritated I could barely watch him. I am not willing to accept this. The trade off is too great. What’s life if you can’t enjoy family visits? I won’t be taking it anymore as of today.,Ahendricks79

20,Hydroxychloroquine,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 11, 2019",28,"Plaquenil is a unique drug that helps control/suppress certain autoimmune symptoms. Plaquenil will not work for everyone with autoimmune issues. But there are other drugs like Erythromycin, Azithromycin, Doxycycline, Fluconazole, Malarone, ect. that may work better for your autoimmune condition. Also, taking 100mg of Doxycycline an hour before the Plaquenil allows the Plaquenil to work more effectively, by breaking down the biofilm of the cells allowing the Plaquenil to penetrate the cell faster and more effectively. If you have fungal related issues like Pleurisy, Edema legs, circulatory issues, thickening of your blood, certain heart issues, or clotting of arteries, etc., a drug like Fluconanzole twice a day with aspirin for at least 6 weeks up to 6 months may actually help relieve those types of symptoms.

However, three weeks into taking the medication, I developed an allergy to it and broke out in hives all over my body. So I had to discontinue, sadly. Very sorry not to be able to take this medication as it seems the best one for controlling my Lupus with the least side effects.",Rosinavos

I still have many days a wk when my entire body hurts. My eye doctor cautioned me not to go to a higher dose for the protection of my eyes. Recently, my daughter noticed a film over half of one eye, which I could not see and my vision is generally not as clear. May not be the right medicine for me.",PBHi

It seems to work very well but as the years have gone on it doesn't work quite as well as it used to. That's why I only rate it at an 8. There was a time when my insurance was messed up, and I didn't have the money to pay for my medications. I could definitely tell the difference when I was not on this medicine. I would definitely recommend it.",small town mom

52,Hydroxychloroquine,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,,,"February 19, 2012",137,Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine):For mild cases of lupus (meaning no organ involvement) I would say this works perfectly fine. Reduces fatigue and joint pain from a 10 to about a 2 depending on weather conditions. If you are active and maintain a healthy diet I would say fatigue and pain are at a nil while taking Plaquenil. It takes maybe a few months to get the dosages correct with your level of pain and fatigue.,Mrs. Boss Ross

Initially, the only difference I noticed was my hair stopped falling out. After taking Plaquenil for a less than a year my face and neck started turning black. My dermatologist is convinced that Plaquenil is the culprit and just recently confirmed it. Between my rheumatologist and dermatologist they're trying to find the right medicine that will work.

Then random ear ringing in my left ear. Doctor discontinued which bummed me out. The rash on my cheek almost vanished and when I went off the medicine it came right back along with all the joint and muscle pain. Upon review doctor is letting me take half pill for 3 weeks then if all well boost up to one versus 1 1/2. I don't know the connection to the ears but the way I felt and looked was worth a little random ring. I am hoping for the best.,pandorascrow
56,Hydroxychloroquine,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,9.0,,"November 16, 2010",72,Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine):The only reason I gave Plaquenil a 9 instead of a 10 is because I still need Imuran as well.  Plaquenil is a great medicine but it's important to have your eyes examined every 6-12 months to check for a RARE side effect of eye damage.,Jesse88
