0,Azathioprine,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 26, 2022",0,"Imuran (azathioprine):I took it for a month. The first week it made me nauseous which I just took promethazine to help with it but it didn't take the feeling completely away. I wasn't really eating and and the diarrhea started at 2 weeks. By the 4th week I felt horrible!! Headache, weakness, stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea from Sunday to Friday. It was then I knew although effective for some and I'd really hoped it would help after seeing so many great reviews but I requested something else.",Nicole
1,Azathioprine,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 18, 2021",0,"I've been taking Azathioprine for over two months now (May 2021) for my lupus. First on low dose then it was raised after a few weeks of taking it. There has been no improvement for me but there has been problems that was caused by Azathioprine. There has been blood in my urine, stomach irritation, occasional nausea, fatigue (even though I'm often fatigue because of lupus & other medications) as well as hair loss. When I was first diagnosed with lupus in April 2020, my symptoms were getting worse & hair loss happen majorly. By mid-October 2020 I was hospitalized for over a month. I started to improve but still not my full self. Still aches & pain but my hair was starting to grow back. However, taking Azathioprine has caused me to lose my hair again but in noticeable areas. Azathioprine isn't working for me & causing me problems.",BB

3,Azathioprine,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 21, 2020",18,Imuran (azathioprine):I have been taking Imuran for over 40 years since I was diagnosed with Lupus. My Lupus have been in remission for over 40 years. I have had a kidney transplant for over 30 years ( failure due to my Lupus). I am strong believer by taking the Imuran my Lupus being in remission and having my transplant for so many years is part of the reason for taking Imuran.,Mara
4,Azathioprine,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,1,,"February 26, 2020",36,"Imuran (azathioprine):I was prescribed  imuran for systemic lupus. I took the medicine for about one month. I had a terrible allergic reaction- I was hospitalized for several days. High fever, liver, joint pain. It is my understanding that Imuran can cause an allergic reaction (it was not a unique reaction to me). I have since learned (from a doctor at the John Hopkins Lupus Center) that there is a test to determine if you will tolerate Imuran. The test checks the level/presence of an enzyme necessary for the body to process or tolerate Imuran. I would ask your doctor about the test for Imuran tolerance before starting Imuran - my allergic reaction was very bad. I am not an alarmist and I understand that Imuran is an effective medicine for many people. However, I wish I had known that a test was available to determine if a patient will tolerate Imuran as this would have been extremely helpful and I could have avoided a very serious allergic reaction to Imuran.",Karagg

In fact, I'm sicker now on it. The biggest side effects for me are loss of appetite, nausea and diarrhea. The diarrhea is horrible. I go at least 10 times a day and nothing helps. I'm exhausted from being so dehydrated and malnourished. When I see my rheumatologist in a week, I'm begging him to try anything else but Imuran. I can't handle it anymore.",Mary

12,Azathioprine,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,9,,"August 18, 2015",7,"I've been on Imuran for a year now. and before this nothing worked for my SLE and Rhuematoid arthritis.  I also take another drug. But before Imuran I couldn't get shoes on because my legs and ankles were so swollen and my feet. I couldn't dress myself. It was so depressing. I haven't been able to go back to work due to seizure disorder, but this medication has given me back a big part of my life, it feels wonderful to be able to be semi self dependant.",dawnkp
13,Azathioprine,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,1,,"August 15, 2015",29,"Imuran (azathioprine):At the 2 wk mark of taking imuran, I started having a terrible headache. My body started to ache. I couldn't get comfortable not matter what I did and I had trouble sleeping. I had a fever, I had chills and I sweated worse than being at the gym.  My urine was golden dark yellow and my skin was pale.  I was tested for the flu which was negative and my blood test results were normal (as normal as can b for a lupus patient). My dr thought I had a virus but told me to stop taking the imuran. Within a little over 24 hours, the headache started going away, the urine went back to normal color and my body was feeling better.",Mommylovescj

Ended up in the hospital. I tried this medication again several years later and immediately started vomiting severely. I had to go by ambulance to the emergency room because I could not go by car. I would use extreme caution when first starting this medication because apparently it can cause severe side effects.",small town mom
15,Azathioprine,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,6,,"March 27, 2014",52,Imuran (azathioprine):I'm a women age 39. I've been on Imuran for over 4 yrs.  Before taking Imuran I was on methotrexate and Lyrica which I had EVERY SIDE EFFECT to. But when I switched medicines and began the Imuran it was very helpful! I could tell a big difference in how I felt. I also have fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis as well.  Over time and up to this point I'm feeling I need something stronger or even different.  I can't tell that I have any known side effects from Imuran.  Doctor suggested I try Benlysta.  I'm scheduled to start that in two weeks!  I'm very nervous because of some of the side effects but you never know until you try! Hope this was helpful! Best of luck!,BB1217
