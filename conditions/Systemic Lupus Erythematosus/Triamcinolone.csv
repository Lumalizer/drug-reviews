0,Triamcinolone,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 1, 2019",6,Kenalog-40 (triamcinolone):Best drug ever! I only wish it lasted longer. I get 80 mg every 3 months in alternating butt cheeks. Takes about 24 hours the wow I'm suddenly able to move again. Not total pain loss of course but much much better. No side affects.  I have severe joint pain all over so this is a miracle drug for me! At about 2 1/2 months pain starts to creep back in. I wish I could get it monthly but Dr says it really should be every 4 months but is willing to give it to me every 3 months.  I highly recommend!,Stacy
1,Triamcinolone,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 21, 2019",21,"Kenalog-40 (triamcinolone):Horrible injection, side effects worse than prednisone except you can't make it stop because it lasts at least 3 to 4 weeks after injection. My dermatologist pressured me to get this shot for my inflamed skin but he did not tell me it would make me so sick with nausea, vomiting and vertigo that I would not be able to function. Almost a month has gone by and I am still sick as anything from Kenalog. I will never let a doctor do this to me again! This drug is awful!!! It makes me thankful for the Lupus!!!",Michelle
2,Triamcinolone,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,10,,"December 7, 2015",26,"Kenalog-40 (triamcinolone):I had strained pretty much my entire body making changes in an old chest.  My whole body seemed to hurt constantly and my hands were essentially unmoving and stiff.  With an on and off Dx of SLE, I went to a rheumatologist.  He injected once in the hip with Kenelog 40.  By the next day I felt as though I were a good 20 years younger, with no pain to speak of anywhere in my body.  My hands and feet were no longer swollen: ring size went from 9 to 8 and had to take up all shoe buckles at least one hole.  My hands had more flexibility and strength than I had had in years.  There were no negative side effects.  It's been 6 months and I continue with the flexibility, etc. that I had from the beginning.  This Kenalog 40 is great stuff!!",Bellecoach
