0,Metformin,Diabetes Type 3c,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 17, 2020",3,"My long time pumper here that got burnt out under the COVID craziness. Was not in a good place. Doctor checked my C-peptide and told me that I was okay to switch to orals. Been on Januvia and Metformin since April 2020 and my numbers have been nearly just as good as when using my Tandem/Dexcom combo! Some people complain about diarrhea or the pill having a fishy smell, but I have chronic constipation and lost my sense of smell after my last sinus surgery, so I haven't had any problems.",Jennie
1,Metformin,Diabetes Type 3c,,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 23, 2019",3,"I have surgically induced Type 3c DM, and Metformin made me go hypoglycemic for hours. Yes, it helps with insulin sensitivity, but since glucagon production is also compromised (not equally I may add), it isn't always possible to autocorrect for the lows.",Avi8rix
