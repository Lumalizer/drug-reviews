0,Infliximab,Uveitis,,,"September 8, 2014",12,"Remicade (infliximab):I am a 28-year-old African-American female. Four years ago I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called, sarcoidosis. Upon being diagnosed with that auto immune disease I was also diagnosed with chronic uveitis and both of my eyes. I was placed on several amuse suppression medications as well as a oral steroid called prednisone. The prednisones left me with unbearable side effects. About a month ago. My rheumatologist started me on Remicade and has also up the dosage of my methotrexate. Since my condition is so aggressive I have to use the maximum dosage of the medication to see progress. I have only received two infusions of Remicade and I can literally see a difference. I was Lucky to receive the Remicade for free through a foundation.",Shonteezy

She has had 2 trabs in right eye and 1 trab in left eye. She was on methotrexate, not working well decided to put her on Remicade. Things were great for almost a year.  The minute her doctor slightly reduced it the inflammation was back in 3 weeks. They had to up her dose and she is still on Remicade every 4 weeks. The medicines are stablizing her but not putting her into remission that's what we are striving for. ",slankelly

Starting in May of 2008 we began an infusion treatment of Remicade and today, her flare is controlled.  Life has returned to ""almost"" normal.  We started at every 4 weeks and have progressed to every 6 weeks. We hope to make it to 8 and still control the flare.I am calling it a miracle drug.  The issue is health care.  We have insurance due to the grace of God.  Each treatment comes at a price tag of $12K.",staceycampo
