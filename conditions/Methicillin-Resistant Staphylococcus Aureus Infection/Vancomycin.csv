0,Vancomycin,Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Infection,10,,"November 19, 2020",7,"I was on this drug after a surgery gone bad where I contracted MRSA. I had a Dura rupture (membrane that surrounds the spinal cord and holds in your celebral spinal fluid) after a spinal surgery, lost all my celebral spinal fluid draining into my body cavity and then developed MRSA around all my internal organs as well mixed with the fluid in my spinal cord and around my brain. After repair, I spent 14 months in ICU Infectious Disease isolation on IV Vancomycin, then had a PICC line put in and self infused at home for 8 more weeks. Like chemo, it is very hard on your systems when given IV.They call it the antibiotic of last resort, maybe so but it works and it saved my life.  Every Dr, RN, and Tech that eyeballed my chart wasn't giving me even a 5% survival chance and without it I know it would have been 0.0%.",Anonymous
1,Vancomycin,Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Infection,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 9, 2019",11,I had an abscessed toothe Dr put me on a strong antibiotic took last pill the day it was pulled. I was hospitalized 10 days later told the MRSA was in my bloodstream going to all my major organs & quarantined. A main IV picline had to be inserted & they gave me IV vancomycin round the clock with an oral antibiotic called rifampin.  I was told by Center for Disease Control it may be weeks. I was sent home on the 7th day but required IV vancomycin 2 times a day for another 7 days. If the vancomycin hadn't worked I probably would've died of sepsis.,Teeth are deadly

3,Vancomycin,Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Infection,10,,"September 1, 2009",26,"This medicine given IV at 5X the recommended adult dose, along with the skill of the best surgeon in Cleveland, SAVED MY LIFE FROM MRSA - which at 9 am looked like a spider bite on my leg and by 1 pm had developed into an orange-sized deadly cyst. I was in isolation for 6 days, coma for one, and AM GRATEFUL FOR MY LIFE! Thank you to the scientists who developed this miracle!! [And don't ignore rapidly enlarging cyst-like growths!]",BarbMarch58
