0,Inderal,Ventricular Tachycardia,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 23, 2014",23,"I was diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia back in the 70's but it was ""paroxysmal"" meaning unpredictable.  I was also diagnosed with anxiety attacks.  The Inderal was critical to my improvement and as life went on, I found that I was low in calcium, magnesium and potassium.  Supplementing those things basically expunged the tachycardia.  If I feel it coming on, I increase those things and use the Inderal and it goes away.  It also helped with the anxiety attacks.  So everyone is different...and diet, supplements are also critical to good health.",barigood
