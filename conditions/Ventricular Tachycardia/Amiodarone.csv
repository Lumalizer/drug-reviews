0,Amiodarone,Ventricular Tachycardia,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 12, 2022",0,I had ventricular tachycardia  due to AV block second degree for which I had a pace maker installed.I am also a bradycardia case. Also I am using a 100 mg Amiodarone for over a year once a day. I am feeling ok with no arrythmias so far. The  cardiologist  will be performing an AV ablation  to see if Amiodarone can be eliminated from my daily take since often I feel too tired in the afternoon and also feel uncomfortable in some days. I have the feeling Amiodarone is the problem due to its long mid life. Now I am using 100 mg every other day. until full elimination (I hope).,Anonymous

3,Amiodarone,Ventricular Tachycardia,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 14, 2020",13,"I experience 10,000 or more PVCs every day, which reduce the heart EF. Started taking 200mg Amiodarone twice a day in December with no immediate side effects. After 30 days I will be taking 200mg once a day, and then drop to 100mg per day for the next few years. I am concerned about long term side effects, but will have to wait and see. Probably will need more frequent blood tests to be sure there are not some hidden problems.Amiodarone does eliminate some antibiotics I have used in the past, so I will need to find acceptable ones if needed in the future. All heart medications I take do not seem to have serious interactions with Amiodarone, but dosages may have to be changed..","Man in Spring, TX"

Tachycardia started in March 18. Normal pulse rose to 125-130. High Cordarone dosage given in the hospital.

5,Amiodarone,Ventricular Tachycardia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 25, 2019",24,"I have Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, septal myectomy in April 2015. Had short runs of v tach that made my life awful. I have a defibrillator but how can you function always feeling unwell?  It was decided by my physician and myself that I wanted my quality of life back -even if it killed me.  It’s has been the best three years of my life. I’m back to farming and being physical and waking up the same as when I went to bed. Tested every 6 months .. it’s worth it to have more than just existence ..",Killer
6,Amiodarone,Ventricular Tachycardia,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2019",26,"Nope. Nada, Never again. This med had me so doped I couldn't hardly function! When I would look to the left or the right my peripheral vision would literally bounce. Electrophysiologist allowed me to stop taking it but warned that we needed to wean off of it so that's what I did. This is one nasty medication if you want quality of life in spite of V-Tach!",Heart Matters

Then 400 mg orally when I was released. I experienced, rashes, uneasiness, trouble walking, insomnia, real bad. Nervous all the time. This stuff is strong and should be used cautiously.

11,Amiodarone,Ventricular Tachycardia,1.0,,"August 9, 2013",49,"I have no doubt that Amiodarone helps some people, but I'm one of those people it didn't help. I have Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia with signs of long QT syndrome. Because of my V-Fib episode (saved by my ICD), my doctor placed me on an Amiodarone regimen with routine organ monitoring. This is making my arrhythmia's worse. I have day long episode of PVC and VTAC runs. I learned that this medicine doesn't work with my type of Ventricular Tachycardia. ",SFRon
12,Amiodarone,Ventricular Tachycardia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 11, 2013",62,"Six months after quintuple by-pass surgery and several heart events I was put on Multaq and shortly thereafter had a defibrillator device implanted.Four years and a slow but steady increase in short cardio events I was prescribed Amiodarone 200mg twice daily, and after controlling the events reduced the dosage to 200mg once daily.  In the ensuing 2 years my cardiac events has drastically reduced in number and severity and my defibrillator activity is almost non-existent.  I do have medium to light side effects including constipation, under skin tingle, short term memory loss and an occasional feeling of unsteadiness.  All a reasonable price to pay for the huge reduction of arrhythmia activity.",donjude
13,Amiodarone,Ventricular Tachycardia,10.0,,"August 14, 2011",53,"Had implanted defibrillator fitted in UK in 2001, moved to Spain 2002, was getting occasional shocks and in 2006 prescribed amiodarone by cardiologist. Shock free for four years, but thyroid overactivity in 2010 caused change to different medicines. I get more shocks than ever and beg to go back on amiodarone even at reduced dosage, but no agreement yet. Had a shock whilst driving last week and two more today whilst relaxing by the pool. I'm nearly 77, alone in Spain, and have had enough of this. Can't drive again. Many problems. No side effects.",Barry Bookmaker
14,Amiodarone,Ventricular Tachycardia,9.0,,"May 16, 2011",53,Great medicine to control atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia but a lot of side effects. I got hyperthyroidism because of that and since I have a defibrillator my heart rate was jumping from 100 to 200b/sec. I got shocked like 17 times while going to work (because heart was going over 200 beats/sec). Then I used other medicines but no luck. Now I am back on Amiodarone because I got shocked and passed out and had a stroke. Doctor said there is no other option but amiodarone and hope for the heart transplant.,janosik
