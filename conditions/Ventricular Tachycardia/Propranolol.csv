0,Propranolol,Ventricular Tachycardia,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 1, 2017",3,"Though put on propranolol to slow my heart rate (which was very high due to hyperthyroidism) they also have the nice side effect of actually making me feel less panicked. When my heart is racing for physiological reasons and I have a reason to feel panicky it feels like a panic attack. Propranolol brings everything down a notch by slowing the heart which in turn brings calm to the mind. Very good stuff! Oh, and living in the UK means that at most I would pay Â£8.60 ($11.36US) every two months when I pick up 168x10mg tablets though in practice as I am poor (income around $8,000US/ annum) it's free for me on the NHS. Ah the wonderful NHS.",jeu198
1,Propranolol,Ventricular Tachycardia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 4, 2015",9,"80mg twice dailyWhen taken regularly and at the right time of the day/night propranolol is awesome.Really helps calm heart/nerves/brain activity.The only drawback is that when you skip a dose (forget or going out) you will have a shit next 24 hours even if you take your next dose as normal.",KmartALI
2,Propranolol,Ventricular Tachycardia,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 23, 2014",23,"Inderal (propranolol):I was diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia back in the 70's but it was ""paroxysmal"" meaning unpredictable.  I was also diagnosed with anxiety attacks.  The Inderal was critical to my improvement and as life went on, I found that I was low in calcium, magnesium and potassium.  Supplementing those things basically expunged the tachycardia.  If I feel it coming on, I increase those things and use the Inderal and it goes away.  It also helped with the anxiety attacks.  So everyone is different...and diet, supplements are also critical to good health.",barigood
3,Propranolol,Ventricular Tachycardia,3.0,,"January 23, 2014",14,"Inderal (propranolol):Doc prescribed this medication to control my high heart rate after a 3 day hospitalization due to supra ventricular tachycardia. I had horrible side effects. Terrible insomnia, sometimes awake for 24 hours. Palpitations. Heavy congested feeling in chest. Anxiety. I was only on it for 10 days! Switched to metoprolol and after 2 days started to feel tons better!!!",Okiedokie1717
