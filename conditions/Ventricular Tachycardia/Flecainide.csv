0,Flecainide,Ventricular Tachycardia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 9, 2021",5,I suffered for 25 years with severe PVCs. They would come and go and recently they started to stay. I had a very intelligent electrophysiologist that gave me flecainide. 50 mg two times per day. My life has changed dramatically. This doctor is my hero!I'm not sure if there's any side effects only that I'm very tired. But I'm 70 years old so maybe that's to be expected. I'll take the fatigue as long as the PVCs are gone.,Barbara
1,Flecainide,Ventricular Tachycardia,1.0,,"August 1, 2021",5,"Tambocor (flecainide):Started taking flecainide one week ago. I have experienced headaches, swelling of face, feeling as if could not think, & legs swelling. I tried cutting dose in half & still same results. This med is not for me.",Anonymous
2,Flecainide,Ventricular Tachycardia,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 9, 2020",6,I've started flecainide back in July of this year 2020 I love it because it has no side effects for me but my cardiologist thinks its not helping my PVC I'm gonna try and ask him to raise the dose to 150mg and monitor me to see if it helps they wanted to put me on metropolol tartrate but I never tried it and refuse to take it so they put me on this medication and it feels great for me I hope I can continue this drug I'm not good with trying out different medications I hope this helps in some kind of way,Mommyj
3,Flecainide,Ventricular Tachycardia,6.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 15, 2020",25,"I started having symptoms of fast heartbeat, dizziness and pain on side of my head when I was just cleaning my house. Almost passed out one day while driving and had to pull off to the side of the road. Went to ER, they said I was fine but I followed up with my doctor who referred me to a cardiologist that put a heart monitor on for 24 hours. He called me right away and told me to go to ER because heart was very out of rhythm. They admitted me, kept me three days and started me on 100 mg Flecainide every 12 hours with lopresser. That was in 2016. I have gained about 40 pounds, can’t breathe, water retention all the time and feel like crap. I’m not sure which drug is  causing weight gain, but I feel like taking my chances and stopping all of it. After a month I talked to my cardiologist and they reduced my Flecainide to50 mg twice a day because my vision was awful, double and blurry. That’s why I am on this site now, to see the symptoms of everyone else.",Chubby
4,Flecainide,Ventricular Tachycardia,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 4, 2019",16,I had Chronic PAC’s and Pvc’s and I was having episodes so frequently that I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack.  After being diagnosed with PAC’s and PVC's.  I was put on 50 mg of Flecainide.  Didn’t help much. Once we got to 150 mg 2x per day they stopped.  I had 972 episodes during the 4Weeks I wore the event monitor.  Quality of life is much better.,Touch
5,Flecainide,Ventricular Tachycardia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 17, 2019",30,"Have dealt with PVCs, PACs and ventricular tachycardia for 30 years.  The last year my PVCS became trigeminy or every third beat was a skip.  I feel these skips so it was a severe quality of life issue for me.  My cardiologist started me on 50mg of flecainide every 12 hours.  I have been taking it for three months and 95% of my PVCs and 100% of my tach is gone.  I do get tired often and lightheaded from time to time but a small price to pay for the elimination of my symptoms.  Hope my good fortune with this drug continues.",Alf
6,Flecainide,Ventricular Tachycardia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 11, 2019",21,"I was put on flecainide about 6 weeks ago - 100 mg twice a day. It immediately stopped my Ventricular tachycardia. But cardiologist didn’t tell me that there is a loading period to be followed by a lower maintenance period. So while felt good in the beginning, after 3 to 5 days on the same dose, I became fatigued and worse, I couldn’t get a good breath of air. Without doc’s input I rolled back to 50 mg twice a day and now I’m at 25 mg twice a day. I still have mild breathlessness, the bigger issue is it won’t let my heart get past 108 bpm. I’m thinking of dropping it altogether. I have an ICD so it will pace me out of VT. I’m very active and will likely get an ablation. Drugs are hard for me to live with.",Bicycleman

9,Flecainide,Ventricular Tachycardia,1.0,,"February 8, 2017",22,"I was put on Flecainide several months ago.  Side effects were fatigue, and dizziness.  Effects were interfering with my life (had to pull over if driving and my commute to work is at least and hour each way).  Fatigue was robbing me of being able to enjoy activities.  I have stopped taking and am looking into other treatment options.",Not an old lady yet!
10,Flecainide,Ventricular Tachycardia,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 11, 2015",35,Tambocor (flecainide):I have been on Flecainide since 2008 for Afib and I am very pleased. I would suggest trying this before a Defibulator or letting them do Ablation.,Patriciads627

12,Flecainide,Ventricular Tachycardia,10.0,,"October 16, 2010",35,"I have been taking a combination of medicines flecainide (50mg twice a day) and metoprolol (12.5mg twice a day) to control idiopathic paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia, for two months now. Trying both medicines separately did not work for me. During the first two weeks of starting flecainide, I experienced moderate to severe side effects including visual disturbances (mostly peripheral), shakiness, vertigo, weakness, nausea, fatigue, and bowel changes. Since my body had a difficult time with the medicine, both medications were reduced in half. It is much better now, but I am still hoping this is not a long-term treatment. I give this medicine a 10 rating for effectiveness. I have not had a single episode (including PVCs) since being on both medications.",Anonymous
