0,Imiquimod,Human Papilloma Virus,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2022",0,"I thought I’d come here to hopefully give someone out there a bit of hope. I read countless forums about imiquimod for genital warts and frankly I was extremely scared to use it in fear of a bad reaction.  Thankfully I gave it a shot! I’ve been using the cream 3x a week for TWO AND A HALF WEEKS now and let me tell you, my warts are almost non existent at this point and I have had no reaction at all! It’s incredible. I was terrified for absolutely nothing. I know most people won’t come and comment about their positive experience, and I know the cream can react differently for everyone but it worked for me and I couldn’t be happier. Hopefully one more week and I’ll be wart free for good!",someone
1,Imiquimod,Human Papilloma Virus,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 14, 2022",1,"Aldara (imiquimod):I contracted HPV almost 2 years ago had no symptoms and in the last few months noticed I had a rather significant cluster of warts almost pop up out of nowhere around my anus and a few on the skin between anus and vagina. I called the doc and they gave me a script to apply 3x a week at bedtime then rinse off in the AM. So far I’m on my 4th application (beginning of week 2) and I’m starting to have some localized symptoms. I noticed from the first application the following morning before showering the warts were swollen, not painful or itchy, just swollen, and it seemed the following day after applying I was having some mild lower back pain, related/ not related, not sure. At this point my only other symptom that just started after my 4th application is itching and some pain/irritation at the site. I’ve been applying Vaseline to help with the irritation. But I’m continuing on because a guess that’s a reaction to the medication working and hopeful this will be a memory soon.",Summita

BE VERY CAUTIOUS when applying this, only apply to the actual wart not the skin around the wart. it will cause extreme blistering and pain if its on healthy skin for too long. if that happens, stop treatment til the blistering goes away and apply a smaller amount directly onto the wart with a q tip.",cbella0220

That didn’t work so I went back and she put vinegar on the clusters and boom they started flaring up so she prescribed me imiquimod and it worked just fine so I stopped cause I thought they was all gone & a few weeks went by & I checked my area & they was back but it was more & even on my anus!  So I started being consistent with it & then one day my whole vaginal and anus was red & itching like crazy ! It was so hard to wipe down there so I used a spray bottle & baby wipes, but the cream worked you just have to be consistent with it or else it’ll come back. Now all my warts are gone & I finally I am back to normal",Cep
5,Imiquimod,Human Papilloma Virus,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 10, 2022",0,"Aldara (imiquimod):This treatment regimen was a real test of endurance. I used this to treat some small warts around the anus and the groin, which appeared after I had a large wart in the groin removed through surgery. This treatment was really tough going and only really started to work after 11 weeks. To be honest, I thought it work sooner if it was going to work and also because I had a lot of inflammation, weeping and rawness. I also bled quite a bit and had to repeatedly stop the treatment. I got to about 14 weeks before I had to quit because I wasn’t healing anymore and the pain was too much but after a few weeks of stopping, I am pretty much back to normal, which I honestly never thought would happen especially as treatment caused one of my small warts to get quite swollen. Because of location, it was difficult to be sparing with application, which probably contributed to symptoms. I used one sachet per week and kept in a zip lock bag in the fridge because its not cheap and this worked for me.",Crumpet121
6,Imiquimod,Human Papilloma Virus,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 30, 2021",0,Aldara (imiquimod):Saw the gp about small bumps on my butt. He said they were warts and put dcp on them. They went after 6 weeks but came back. Then I used Aldara after seeing a dermatologist. The aldara will cause pain and bleeding after a while but just keep at it for a few months and the warts will go. They have not come back and the dermo said they are unlikely to return. The virus supposedly leaves your body after a while so don’t worry about it.  The pain and bleeding is annoying but better than having warts on my genitals.,Geoff

I went and got a prescription for Aldara, trust me I only applied once and my warts were completely gone. I was advised to apply once every 2nd day of the week and but I was shocked at how quick that was, I'm continuing to use it just for the duration as I was told.

I was devastated. I have been celibate for over 3 years, so I know I contracted it more than 3 years ago. I got my first gardasil 9 vaccine and started treatment with Condylox for 4 weeks the warts decreased in size but nothing significant. I got my second gardasil 9 shot and decided to try Aldara. For the first 5 weeks I noticed nothing except for INTENSE ITCHING and BURNING after the 2nd week.  I began doing an apple cider vinegar bath before the treatment (to soften the hard warts) and now I am on week 6, about to start week 7 and all of the warts have started to shrink (tiny tiny) and are almost all gone. Jesus and Lidocaine 5% have helped me get through this treatment. Aldara feels after week 2, like my absolute worst yeast infection multiplied by 1000.","AMC, 32 F"

I wish I’d read the reviews on this page sooner. I definitely applied too much... I’ve never been in so much excruciating pain. My vagina is RAW and so so sore. Can’t walk, can’t sit, can’t sleep, can’t wee without swearing. I’ve also had the worst dizzieness/fatigue/shivers/hot sweats.  It’s horrendous.

Let me just say this cream is not pleasant at all. It causes mild itching and discharge sometimes and gave me a sore, but the worst thing is I experience aches and fatigue. After one week, I thought it was not working but after 2 weeks, the warts have almost flattened and i can see improvement. My advice is really only use it 3 times per week, a thin layer, the next day just start taking panadol and continue with it. Try not to mess it up by picking on the warts. It will get better, it is just very unpleasant",Charlene
13,Imiquimod,Human Papilloma Virus,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 5, 2021",3,"Aldara (imiquimod):Was diagnosed with 9 genital warts last year January even though I have never had unprotected sex before. I was advised not to worry about it, as my immune system will fight them off. However, I decided to purchase  Aldara, which cleared 50 percent of warts without reoccurrence. I was not happy with it because Aldara is freaking expensive and I expected it to be effective. Moving on, I was asked to see a specialist. I was told I could opt for surgery which is 90% effective and the best treatment. So I did the surgery just recently and I'm now wart-free. The surgery is painless once prescribed with local anesthesia compared to Aldara which felt like being burnt down there. I will just advise anyone reading this if you have the funds or insurance, go for surgery or electrocautery. Stop wasting money on Aldara, however, Aldara may be effective for some people.",Jake123

17,Imiquimod,Human Papilloma Virus,10.0,,"May 13, 2021",4,"So when I started it area around the wart started getting inflamed on second use only, by the third use I noticed some yellow stuff coming off of the skin touching the wart & it had become painful so I gave it a break of 3 days and after a week & it healed. In week 2 it had become even bigger than I first started probably because I started using it while it was still growing, also I started covering my extremely sensitive area with doctor tape so that when I apply the medicine on wart it doesn’t touch the sensitive area which helped A LOT, however the wart was still there. Fortunately on the 3rd day of the 2nd week half of it was gone & by the 3rd week it was gone like it was never there. This cream definitely works and the pain was bearable & temporary, it needs to be used in a very small quantity & if you feel that the pain is getting unbearable just give yourself a break of 2-3 days after every week. Vaseline can be used in areas surrounding wart to protect the good skin.",AG

First 2 weeks I had heavy discharge and felt a bit uncomfortable. The third week the redness, headaches, sore throat, night sweats started. By the end of 4th week my vagina was unrecognisable. I had open sores which had to be swabbed for herpes (negative) so I had to stop using it. I don't think I could continue any longer anyway.I do admit I was using too much by the 4th week as it wasn't working at all and I was becoming desperate. So stupidly the bad reaction was my fault.

To be honest, I don't even know if it was the cream or just time that got rid of the warts. I never had a huge outbreak but they were stubborn. It started with two bigger ones. They decreased in size after using the cream but never really went away. I ripped most of them off to be honest. I know how you guys feel. I was severely depressed during this time. Side effects were non existent in the beginning but after some time they were horrible: My skin got so thin that it ripped all the time (I mean huge tears like after giving birth), I've had constant yeast infections and couldn't pee without being in pain (put your hands on the floor while peeing, thank me later).

22,Imiquimod,Human Papilloma Virus,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 8, 2021",5,Aldara (imiquimod):I was exposed to a lying partner. After we had sex I developed a wart 30 days later.  One month later I was given aldara. I was prescribed three nights a week for six weeks but my warts came off after two applications.  I continued the medication as my paranoia of HPV —naïvely-was greater than the damage aldara  could cause. At week three I had ulcers on my vulva and severe erosion. My doctor told me to stop the medicine. nobody warned me that dormant autoimmune diseases can be set off permanently by the medicine. I now have lichen planus on my vulva for the rest of my life. do not take this medicine allow your body to naturally fight off the warts!  that is what I wish I had known then.,Christi
23,Imiquimod,Human Papilloma Virus,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 27, 2021",2,I went to a sexual health clinic and found out I had genital warts. After much crying they prescribed me imiquimod 5% to put on every other day. It’s been approx. 2 weeks and my warts are clearing! I also have lichen sclerosus so my vulvar area is very sore and I use steroid creams and moisturisers to keep that at bay. I am getting to the point where I am very sore but I ice the area the day after the cream when it’s the most painful then apply moisturiser on my off days. I hope this review helps other people with lichen sclerosus as it was hard to find information with both conditions.

You don’t have to finish the whole sachet. I got two warts on my genital area on extremely sensitive skin. They weren’t really bothering me but I was worried about them spreading to other places. I took a q-tip and applied a very thin layer on each making sure to rub until the cream disappeared. I tried to leave it on a bit to dry completely so the discharge won’t spread it to other places of the vagina. GET RID OF THE SACHET ONCE YOU OPEN IT, don’t reuse it.

It doesn't burn or sting well it didn't for me the only thing it did to me was give me a bit of a itch in the morning when I woke up but as soon as I washed the area the itch was gone and I have had no side effects from it so all good.

I have now done 2 Aldara courses of 6 weeks each and all the vin3 has totally gone and there are no dodgy cells at all. I applied it 3 times a week at night and left it on for 10 hours.Week 4 I started to get a bit sore on my vulva but nothing major and was bearable.  Come week 6 no sores nothing at all but only part of the vin3 had been resolved so hospital told me to carry on with another 6 week cycle. It certainly wasn't as bad as I expected and wanted to do a review so if anyone is like I was and terrified please do try it though.   Everyone reacts differently and you might have no reaction or only mild like me.  The main issue for me was a continued upset stomach. My hair also snapped a lot and has become dry but the hosp said its how I have reacted.  It is a form of chemo so its strong stuff.

Dr. prescribed me imiquimod and told me ""1-2 months."" I just finished my 4th week and it was a BRUTAL month. The applied area feels like someone took a blowtorch to my groin. The skin feels absolutely fried and looks horrendous. Soreness came and went, plus a lot of clear drainage/discharge that had an awful odor. I've followed instructions carefully, applying 3 times a week, M/W/F, washing off before application and then in the morning (after 6-10 hours). I believe most of the smaller warts have been destroyed but it's tough to tell because the skin looks like it's been burnt off. The pain hit unbearable levels the last few days. The bigger warts haven't been impacted at all. Today I couldn't even lay in bed comfortably because any movement irritates the skin. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.

Just over three weeks in and the smaller one is completely gone and the skin is almost healed apart from a little redness, the other has almost disappeared. No real noticeable side effects. Felt a little run down one or two days but it is December. I was quite aware of the area in that there was some slight discomfort and the occasional itch, but nothing close to pain. The skin itself did get quite red and there was some dry skin. But nothing major. If it helps I was very careful not to spread the cream onto any particularly sensitive areas.

I took it for 3 weeks & the end of week 1-all of week 2 was just so awful. I couldn’t sit/walk. I had no sleep due to intense itching, showers 3x/day. I also experienced a lot of clear drainage coming from the warts as they died & it would stick/dry to my underwear so instead I either slept without underwear or I put a pad on. I also put aloe vera & it soothed the itching. Towards the end of my treatment, warts immediately spread to my inner thighs & some parts of my butt in clusters, which was extremely annoying. Fortunately they were small so they were gone in about 2-3 days. Itching still persisted while healing, but used vagisil and it immediately went away.Although this cream really does wonders & gets the job done it left me really sore & I have scars in my bikini area which kind of sucks.

I was VERY careful made sure I had full visibility of where I was applying the cream and making sure the cream was absorbed before moving on. Only used what was necessary and disposed the left overs. At 2nd week I did take some time off cause my skin felt sensitive but after a few days I started again and realized that half of them were gone. I read that you could use salicylic acid from OTC meds BUT HAVE IN MIND IT IS NOT FOR GENITAL WARTS because its too strong for the skin in the genital area.

It's not a quick fix but you have to be patience with it.

I found I couldn't sit or walk without being in agony. However I persisted as and by the end of the week it was clear. Some tips !-aloe vera is your best friend. Apply it as often as you can because it will help with the blisters and irritated skin-when peeing, take a class of cold water and pour it at the same time, or squired bottled water. This really helps with the burning and stinging. Also apply aloe vera after peeing-DONT apply to much cream or leave it on for more than 10 hours.

My dermatologist told me this first hand and people who are healthy will naturally clear this virus. It incubated for around 6 months and then symptoms appear.

Try and clean the area twice a day and if you have ulcers just run cool-warm water over it no matter how painful it is to keep it clean so you don't get infection.

Doctor found a small bump on my inner labia and assumed it was a wart although all Pap smears were neg for HPV. Started using this cream. 3 nights a week. By my 5th application I was in so much agonizing pain I couldn’t take it anymore. Extremely swollen. Very red. Sores all over inner labia. Hurts to walk, sit, shower, pee. Basically any normal activities I am now crying just to get through. I would NEVER recommend to anyone. There is no way this should be on the market.

Here is my advice: -only apply 3 times a week, reduce if you feel too much pain.-when starting the treatment, only apply a really tiny amount of cream on each wart with the end of a cotton bud. Only when you are ready, start applying a tiny bit more but it should stay minimal. -it will create discomfort. Use baby wipes for the toilet; buy an intimate gel to take care of the area that is infected. I took 2 showers a day during the treatment to keep the area clean at all times. No pyjama bottoms to avoid any contact.-the pain is OKAY. It can burn healthy skin in the night when the warts with cream rub against it. Put some tiny plasters opposite the wart for the night. It gets itchy during the day, but stay busy. - be positive: eat healthily, stop smoking. Have someone to help you go through it. Had 6 genital warts and 5 were completely gone by week 2.

I then proceeded to pinch off as much of the wart I could grab. It bled a little but I didn't feel any pain! I let the cut heal for a few days then used the cream once and I've never seen better results! THE WHOLE WART IS GONE! I DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT TO SHRINK IN SIZE! Now I do not know if this is safe or recommended but I figured if I went to get them surgically removed then they'd basically do the same thing but with a scalpel and charge me a lot!

After that I had no side effects except for a small swollen armpit lymph node. NO PAIN NO ITCHING NO SCABBING. Just used vaseline before applying and took vitamins C and D everyday.

Your love life DOES continue... And you should not be worried. 90% of all cases clear up for good within two years, and for those that don't, Aldara is a powerful medication to finish it off (Not a cure!). I had that lasted for three years until finally a doctor prescribed me Aldara on Dec 11, 2011. For the first eight weeks, nothing happened (as is common for male treatment), but my doctor seemed to be disheartened by the lack of progress and opted to have them frozen off.A week later I finished the remaining four weeks of treatment. The affected area was red and painless. My doctor finally told me... ""You're cured.""",Anonymous1987

I'm sorry for those that had severe side effects but I think it is important to note how effective and great this medication is and how it can work well if used properly!!
