1,Opdivo,Renal Cell Carcinoma,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 24, 2021",0,"Daddy was on this for about 6 months.  Would have been longer if his cancer didn't spread to his brain.  This does not cross the blood brain barrier.  This was the best medicine he ever took.  Took in combination with Yervoy.  Daddy had CLEAR cell RCC.  It was in his stomach, liver, lung, and right atrium (heart) at the time.  This medicine got rid of the cancer in his stomach, atrium, and lungs.  I highly recommend this medicine.  Daddy was still working at an automotive mechanic while taking this medicine.  Side effects were minimal.  The only thing is his immune system seemed to be more weak.  That was it.  He also had no kidneys left from the cancer.  So he was on dialysis.  I wish he could have stayed on this.",For daddy
2,Opdivo,Renal Cell Carcinoma,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 3, 2020",10,"Opdivo was the end for my husband!!! The doctors had been pushing this drug at us for 2 years. My husband finally decided to try it and 7 weeks after his first infusion he passed away due to complications from the medication!!! It caused pseudo diabetic symptoms, respiratory failure and numerous other complications!!! I would not recommend this treatment for anyone!!! I feel that they faked their trial runs to get funding for their experimental treatment!",GCPYS
