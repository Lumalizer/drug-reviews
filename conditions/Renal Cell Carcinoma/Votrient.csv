0,Votrient,Renal Cell Carcinoma,8.0,,"December 27, 2021",0,"My husband had a nephrectomy of his left kidney, it had spread to his left testicle and had the testicle removed as well. Before the operation, the surgeon said that the mass had been slow growing for roughly ten years. He is 67, and in mostly good health outside of the cancer. It has been a year and a half on Votrient. The first dosage was too high and caused him a few hospital visits to stabilise his liver function. Now he is on half that dose, the only prominent side effect is the occasional nausea, fatigue and vomiting/fainting spells. Of course his hair has also gone completely white. He is very thin and struggles to put on weight but has a healthy appetite. It seems that this dosage is working, his cancer cells have shrunk. He goes for a PET scan twice a year and has been clear so far. In 4 months will be 2 years since diagnosis. So far the medication is working. The diet seems to be the trickiest part and I would recommend that you see an expert dietician. A specific diet is NB.",Anonymous
1,Votrient,Renal Cell Carcinoma,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 24, 2021",0,"Daddy has Clear cell renal cell carcinoma.  He was first put on Opdivo and Yervoy--an immunotherapy.  This worked great!  It was shrinking my dad's tumors that he had in his stomach, liver, lungs, and right atrium (heart).  It even got rid of all the cancer in his stomach.  The cancer spread to his brain and he had to be put on chemotherapy.  Votrient had a lot of side effects.  Nausea, super high blood pressure,  major fatigue, and chemo brain fog.  He lost 80 pounds on votrient from not eating.  Became frail and fragile and we were afraid he would die from malnutrition.   We begged the doctor to take him off it because she even said he wouldn't live much longer on it, but the issue was the votrient was SHRINKING the tumors in his liver.  This was a sign it was working.  His doctor put him on dexamethasone 2mg which helped his energy levels and his appetite tremendously.  He gained 40 pounds! He was on votrient 6mos but BP and brain fog got worse though so she then put him on Avastin.",For daddy
2,Votrient,Renal Cell Carcinoma,10.0,,"October 17, 2021",1,I was diagnosed with renal cancer 6 years ago. My left kidney was removed. I received no chemotherapy or radiation due to the fact it was ineffective on a clear cell carcinoma. I had 3 nodules on my lungs at the time it was diagnosed. 5 years later a CT scan showed the 3 nodules grew and two more appeared on my right lung. A wedge section was removed from my left lower lung. The Metastasis was confirmed to stage 4 cancers. After 2 opinions I tried a combination of Keytruda infusion and Inlyta tablets. I had a severe reaction to the Keytruda thankfully the doctor and nurses saved me. I had several options and went for Votrient. I  have had no serious side effects. My blood pressure became elevated but was brought under control with an increase of blood pressure medication. I  just had a CT scan. The 3 remaining nodules shrunk and 1 disappeared. No other signs of cancer. I am a new user but so far I think this drug is a miracle.,3 month user

During that time I had just about every side effect possible change in taste, diarrhea, white hair, tiredness.  I finally had brick red urine and turned yellow as it attacked my liver.  Found out side effects were so bad because a previous cancer drug, Opdivo, was still in my system.  After 6 weeks of steroids, I tried Votrient again.  This time, I got tired and had a fever within a week.  Blood test showed it was attacking my liver once again.  I was back on steroids.

I wound up with nausea, extreme hoarseness,  high blood pressure,  fatigue with sleeping 18 to 22 hours a day. Took a turn for the worse and liver enzymes were high.

Side effects have included hand and foot pain (very slight now) and have experienced weight loss (from 180 lbs to around 130 lbs) over the last three years.  As of this year, there have been no signs of liver problems but have had minor digestion issues.  It appears that Votrient has been successful -unlike my experience with Sutent, Avastin, Xeloda and Affinitor.  I had been diagnosed with stage IV renal cell carcinoma-sarcomatoid in 2008, and had the left kidney removed (and spleen due to a fall in the hospital).
