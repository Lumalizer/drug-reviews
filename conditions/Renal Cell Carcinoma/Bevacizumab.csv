0,Bevacizumab,Renal Cell Carcinoma,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 24, 2021",0,"Avastin (bevacizumab):My dad was on avastin for close to a year.  It actually kept him alive.  I'm sharing his experience because there are so many bad reviews on here and I wanted to share ours.  The side effects weren't too bad.  He seemed to have some issues with clotting but nothing major.  He also had higher blood pressure, but this was nothing compared to the votrient he was on.  He had to come off Votrient because the high BP it caused would always put him in the hospital.  Avastin was great considering, and it kept my dad alive.  It also kept the tumors away.  He also had the renal cell carcinoma go to his brain.  And the avastin helped keep the left over brain tumor small.    My dad has Clear cell renal cell carcinoma.  This is important to know because it is one of the hardest cancers to fight.  He also had it in his liver, lungs, stomach, heart (atrium), and brain.  This avastin kept it at bay and Cleveland clinic actually believed that my dad was cancer free from it.",Sharing for dad

I believe the Tarceva was the cause of Crohn's like side effects.The Avastin seemed not as bad with side effects. Presently using Votrient and approaching a five year longevity mark when my statistical would have been 8-10 months.,LabRat2
