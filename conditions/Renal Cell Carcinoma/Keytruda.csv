0,Keytruda,Renal Cell Carcinoma,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2022",0,"My mom was diagnosed with kidney cancer that spread to her lungs. My mom was talking, walking aside from the cancer nothing physically was wrong with her. When she had her first treatment of  Keytruda she started experiencing coughing up blood, severe diarrhea, it got so bad to the point she ended up in ICU unable to walk or talk and eventually she ended up passing away. This drug does not help it only speeds up the death process.",Blueskyy
