0,Afinitor,Renal Cell Carcinoma,4,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 20, 2019",2,Everolimus was part of my first line treatment.  I had to dose reduced twice.  I was very fatigued and the nausea and diarrhea put me in the ER 4 times.  I did have a partial response but I had a very poor quality of life.  I was dependent on electric wheelchair and was unable to do daily task. My hair thinned I lost a lot of weight. My appetite was non existant and I got mouth sores. But it did work for a while so I would do it again,Vic
