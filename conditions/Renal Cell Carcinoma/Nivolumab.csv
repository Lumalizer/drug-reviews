It's been a month since  last treatment and still severe pain.  I wouldn't recommend it to any one. Dr. Keeps telling me it will go away. Pain medications don't work!!",Melodie corley
1,Nivolumab,Renal Cell Carcinoma,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 24, 2021",0,"Opdivo (nivolumab):Daddy was on this for about 6 months.  Would have been longer if his cancer didn't spread to his brain.  This does not cross the blood brain barrier.  This was the best medicine he ever took.  Took in combination with Yervoy.  Daddy had CLEAR cell RCC.  It was in his stomach, liver, lung, and right atrium (heart) at the time.  This medicine got rid of the cancer in his stomach, atrium, and lungs.  I highly recommend this medicine.  Daddy was still working at an automotive mechanic while taking this medicine.  Side effects were minimal.  The only thing is his immune system seemed to be more weak.  That was it.  He also had no kidneys left from the cancer.  So he was on dialysis.  I wish he could have stayed on this.",For daddy
2,Nivolumab,Renal Cell Carcinoma,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 3, 2020",10,"Opdivo (nivolumab):Opdivo was the end for my husband!!! The doctors had been pushing this drug at us for 2 years. My husband finally decided to try it and 7 weeks after his first infusion he passed away due to complications from the medication!!! It caused pseudo diabetic symptoms, respiratory failure and numerous other complications!!! I would not recommend this treatment for anyone!!! I feel that they faked their trial runs to get funding for their experimental treatment!",GCPYS
3,Nivolumab,Renal Cell Carcinoma,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 20, 2019",4,I started opdivo as my 3rd line of treatment.  I had very few side effects at first and could eat like a horse.  Unfortunately I got really really bad flares of rheumatoid arthritis.   I had a partial response but the lung and messintary tumors grew and the RA became a problem. I would take it again but unfortunately was not my savior. Best luck to the next person to try it,Vic
4,Nivolumab,Renal Cell Carcinoma,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 17, 2019",4,"Be very, very careful with nivolumab. Within just 8 weeks it caused an explosion of my father’s lung metastases from renal cell carcinoma. It caused fluid around his lungs and heart. It might be a miracle cure for some but for every person that it so called ‘cures’ it seems to caused disastrous consequences for 10 other patients. I would use extreme caution in deciding to take this medication. It is very unpredictable.",Myfather

7,Nivolumab,Renal Cell Carcinoma,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 4, 2019",4,Opdivo (nivolumab):I was on Opdivo for 4 months for stage 4 RCC.  Felt good with diarrhea was the only side effect until I got blurry vision in one eye.  During those 4 months I had no increase in the side of the tumors.,Faith
8,Nivolumab,Renal Cell Carcinoma,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 14, 2017",20,"I've  had 7 two weekly infusions and so far I've had no side effects, none! After 6 infusions I was scanned and I was told it was working really well. My kidney cancer in my chest lymph glands have shrunk and the kidney cancer that has spread to my lungs has also shrunk! Nivolumab is my second line of attack, the first being Pazopanib. I only got 4-5 months out of Pazopanib, but I had quite a lot of side effects with it. So taking nivolumab and having no side effects is a real godsend. I haven't felt this good in 4 years, I feel stronger and I'm putting the weight back on I lost taking Pazopanib. Hair/have returned to normal colour. I hope this lasts a long time for me and I hope this post helps in some way. Good luck and God bless all.",Des2e

11,Nivolumab,Renal Cell Carcinoma,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 25, 2016",11,"Yesterday we celebrated my daughter's birthday and Thanksgiving without my husband who passed away in June. He was diagnosed with Neuroendocrine Carcinoid Tumors in 2010 and survived a wonderful 6 years. He did very well with Afinitor until it began to give him pneumonia. In March this year his doctor started him on Opdivo. HIs energy immediately plummeted. In early March he felt well enough to plan a vacation to Alaska for early June. By early April he wanted to cancel it.  He had 3 injections of Opdivo over March and April. He went into hospice in May and passed away in June.  I'm not saying Opdivo killed him since his cancer markers were starting to rise before starting it, but they skyrocketed after starting it.",Missing my husband
