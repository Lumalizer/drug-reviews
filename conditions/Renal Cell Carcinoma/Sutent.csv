4,Sutent,Renal Cell Carcinoma,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 20, 2019",2,This was my 2nd line of treatment. I did not response to this medicine. I had many side effects. The worst being low platelets that caused me twice to stopped treatment temporarily. I dose reduced from 50 to 37.5  but it did not help. I had nausea that was tolerable for the most part thanks to a nausea patch. I had to get one transfusion due to blood counts.  My hair thinned and turned white but that's mild. Hair has since returned to prior thickness and color.,Vic
5,Sutent,Renal Cell Carcinoma,10.0,,"November 14, 2019",21,"Sutent is still a very good drug to use for treating kidney cancer. To follow up from a previous post, Sutent continues to have a great success for me personally, but as of late the drug dosage was reduced due to some new side effects. While SCANs remain good there seems to be a delicate balance for exactly how much of the drug is necessary. While the normal dosage for me was set at 50 mg once a day for 14 days on 7 days off, my oncologist has reduced the dosage to 37.5 mg. It appears that this new dosage is easier on my body while doing its targeted therapy to control cancer cells. It will be 5 years since radical surgery (removal of left kidney, spleen, and the adrenal gland) this coming February, and the quality of life has been great. No huge side effects from the onset but some bumps in the road that I was able to overcome.",Jim Bob

7,Sutent,Renal Cell Carcinoma,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 11, 2019",44,I have been on Sutuent for 3.5 years now with minor side effects. I tried the 4 week on and 2 week off but that did not work for me. Now on 2 weeks off 1 week and that is tolerable. So far this drug has caused my tumor in the surgery bed to shrink. The left kidney was removed 4.5 years ago. Quality of life is good and I am living a full and happy life. I thank the company that produces this targeted therapy drug for patients like me. There is hope after a kidney cancer diagnosis. For all of those who are currently going through this just remember that years ago drug therapy was not yet available and life expectancy was short. A positive attitude and great family support all help when fighting an aggressive disease like cancer.,Jim Bob
8,Sutent,Renal Cell Carcinoma,8.0,,"March 4, 2019",23,"I have started my chemo journey 7 years ago dealing with stage 4 kidney cancer. They removed my left kidney and filled a hole in my left knee with cement bone and 2 weeks of radiation treatment then I went on remission for a period of 4-5 years. A lump appeared just below my right jaw so 2 biopsy was performed and found out that it was the same cancer cell so, I was put on Votrient 200 mg per tablet and took 3 per day for almost 22 months. I couldn't take the Votrient any more. My oncology doctor suggested for me to take a holiday and I did for almost 5 months. So in November 2017, a catscan was ordered and the results was I have a tumor on my left side. I have been taking Sutant 50 mg since December 2017 and it did shrink my tumor. I was very happy and now off the Sutent and waiting to have another catscan to make sure that there is no surprises. I found this chemo drug Sutent works better for me and I my body can tolerate it.

9,Sutent,Renal Cell Carcinoma,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 23, 2019",26,"I'm speaking for my Husband.  In 2002 he lost his right kidney, he's a Marine from Vietnam.  In 2013 I thought he had pneumonia, when I took him to the Doctor the xray showed his whole right lung was occluded with a tumor, not operable.  We went to his Oncologist and they started him on Sutent . Two collapsed lungs , two lazer treatments for bleeding but his right lung is now wide open, he is frail but upright. Why it's his attitude, he said I'm a Marine and I'll beat this.  So please hang in there, keep a positive attitude. I believe he is the longest living person right now on this drug. No taste buds, diarrhea yes but he's here and that is what we want.  God bless you all and keep you safe...",Crazyhorse
10,Sutent,Renal Cell Carcinoma,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 1, 2018",12,"I collected my brothers ashes y/day. He was on sutent for sarcomatoid kidney cancer. Sutent made him so very very ill, it destroyed any quality of life he had left before he died (6 months from diagnosis to his passing). He died after 5 days in hospital vomiting blood, possibly from perforated stomach/ intestine/bowel. This drug is so cytotoxic my local pharmacy refused to accept the remaining tablets we had after he died. Sutent, I called it  an evil drug as that's what it is.",Deg

I got my left kidney removed and three years later I discovered a mets in the spine and liver which was treated with radiation followed by sutent.

It does knock the stuffing out of me, but I'm loathe to drop to 37.5mg. I never get sick or have diarrhea, just exhaustion. I'm planning to go on for a long time yet, my biggest problem is myself not responding fast enough to my body, which is screaming at me to rest. When the clock is ticking, you don't want to stop do you?","Jarface, England"
16,Sutent,Renal Cell Carcinoma,9.0,,"February 26, 2014",84,"I have been on Sutent for 4 months. My cancer is shrinking and it is not bad. I am on Oxycontin as well because the cancer had gotten into my bones and spine. Degradation of my spine. So I now have a brace in my back. Side effects. Sutent has almost a narcotic effect on me. Bad gas and my taste buds are all messed up. Constipation. My biggest complaint comes during the 2 weeks off. Its like I go through withdrawals that are really intense. Shaking, pain all over. And I'm so weak for those two weeks its hard if not impossible to get out of bed. But all in all Sutent has been doing its job many of the tumors are smaller if not gone. And the large masses went from baseball to golf ball size. Pleased with Sutent.",conradclark

18,Sutent,Renal Cell Carcinoma,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 9, 2012",112,On Sutent  for 9 months and was extremely fatigued but minimally nauseous.  Doctor guesstimate  is an additional 9 months.  Original diagnosis was clear cell cancer and removed right kidney.  Annual exam revealed it metastisized to left adrenal gland.  Pet scan reveals some tumors have disappeared and remaining ones are shrinking.  No new tumors seem to have appeared. My quality of life has not seemed to have decreased and I feel blessed everyday that Sutent therapy is working for me.,barbie billings
19,Sutent,Renal Cell Carcinoma,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 3, 2012",79,"I have been on Sutent now for 13 months. The full monty at 50 mg. It seems to be doing its main job which is to shrink and freeze the metastasis I have in lungs. I am told my own side effects are mild compared with most. The ones with medical significance and danger are under control - these are the high blood pressure, which is under control with additional blood pressure pills, and the messed up thyroid, also under control with pills. The main things that bothers me are the gastro side effects. I cannot get the diarrhea under control.  The painful violent gas now seems controllable using Simethicone.  I get a very acidy stomach with heartburn in last two weeks of cycle.  Sometimes can relieve with milk.",Eliezer b Y
20,Sutent,Renal Cell Carcinoma,7.0,,"October 5, 2011",102,"I've been on Sutent since December 2008. First at 50 mg for 3 cycles then due to side effects dose reduced to 37.5 mg for about 3 more cycles but still had problems with my blood counts. Then the dose was reduced to 25 mg so since about 2 years ago I have been on Sutent 25 mg, 2 weeks on 1 week off. My tumors shrunk 30% since the beginning and now I've been stable. Side effects are mild, sometimes a little bit harder but I am grateful I am still here and living a full life.",mariavero

Since then the cancer reformed in my hip causing a partial hip replacement, then on to mybreast bone (radiation treatment) and finally my lung and adrenal gland. At thatpoint I was put on Sutent 50mg which caused white count issues. We dialed down to37.5 which stabilized the blood and now after three months my tumors have shrunk by half. Side effects are not pleasant but tolerable. Bottom line I am still alivethanks to Sutent.",Anonymous

I have had very managable side effects and put this down to diet change: no sugar, low carb and minimal alcohol. I'm 42 and I'm leading a very active life thanks to Sutent.
