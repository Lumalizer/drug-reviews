0,Flecainide,Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia,5,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 3, 2021",1,"I started taking flecainde in September 2020.  It worked great for my PSVT.  It was the busy season at work so I thought all the 'changes' were due to the stress.  I had dizziness, was off balance, my left had started shaking, I got lost 3 times returning home from the store on routes I had been on 100's of times, visual disturbances, and memory problems.  In April 2021 went to my PCP about other issues, and then my cardiologist because my blood pressure decided to drop really low.  Mentioned all the things that were happening, he said 'oh, it is the flecainide' and took me off of it.  Everything returned back to normal in about 4 weeks with the exception of the hand shaking and memory problems.  I am being told that since the medicine is out of my system it is not related to my memory issues, however I am not convinced.  At this point no one can tell me what is wrong with my memory.",Shari
1,Flecainide,Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia,1,,"February 6, 2021",5,"Do not take this medicine. I am currently on flecainide for frequent PVCs my burden was 16%. While it does calm them down it this medicine sucks the life out of you. This med is great for a couple weeks but then I started having a lot of side effects. Constant headache, dizziness lightheadedness, back spasms, loss of weight, anxious all the time. This medicine is not for everyone but if you decide to take it read up on it. It solves one prob it creates a ton more! I wouldnâ€™t wish this med upon my worst enemy! Awaiting an ablation for my left posterior fascicle PVCs.",Torgy
2,Flecainide,Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 24, 2021",3,I was put on 50mg twice a day and it didn't work for PVC's which is an addition heart beat. We up it the 150mg pill twice a day and it worked . It eliminated the PVC's. Only side affect was a little constipation but I consider that a good trade off since the PVC's were causing my heart to work harder and could cause a heart attack.,Trekie
3,Flecainide,Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 15, 2019",30,"I've been dealing with paroxysmal AFib for 4 years. I am a healthy, athletic 64 year old male. After my first episode, cardiologist did all the tests, echocardiogram etc. Heart is structurally healthy.  He put me on  Toprol 25 mg twice a day. Didn't get another episode for about 2yrs. AFIB returned more frequently maybe once every 6 months, and has increased to almost weekly. I always self convert after 6-8 hours but it is very annoying. And I'm very afraid of a stroke as I was not on any blood thinners. New cardiologist put me on 50mg flecainide 2x a day, toprol XR and Xarelto. So far not one incident. Flecainide seems to be working wonderfully. No side effects except for being a little tired. We'll see how this works I want to avoid in ablation if I can help it.",In Rhythym
4,Flecainide,Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 25, 2017",16,I have been on Flecainide for 3 months. It has totally eliminated my PSVT. I am on 100 mg twice a day. I have not noticed any side effects. I wonder if I should go through with the planned ablation.,xMooneyDriver
5,Flecainide,Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 19, 2013",37,"I've had Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia for 4 years. It got so bad I was in incessant PSVT, one episode right after another for hours at a time. Had two cardiac ablations. I've been on other meds, like Cardizem, Toprol. Nothing works to stop PSVT like Flecainide. I only take 50mg once a day, instead of the usual 50 mg twice a day and that works for me with no noticeable side effects. Without it, I would have to get a pacemaker.",PSVT for Four Years
6,Flecainide,Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia,10,,"July 26, 2011",43,"After a year of various medicines including Inderal, Cardizem, Multaq, and Toprol XL, I was started on flecainide 50 mg twice daily with Toprol 25 mg XL. It has made a BIG difference in my quality of life. Prior to taking it I had a resting heart rate of 110 and often had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia that sent me to the ER 5 times in 10 months. I felt bad all the time. I recently had an EP study which revealed that an ablation is not an option for me, so I am back on flecainide again. Feeling good again. I am an otherwise healthy 42 yo female.",Anonymous
