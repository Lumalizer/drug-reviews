1,Colchicine,Behcet's Disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 22, 2018",4,"After my diagnosis of Beh√ßet's Disease, my doctor started me on colchicine for treatment. We continued to increase the dosage while trying to find the ""sweet spot"" for me to obtain maximum benefit. However, the medicine did not provide any relief for me. It also did not have any side effects. My physician changed to another treatment plan to attempt to control my symptoms.Unfortunately, not every medication reacts the same for everyone for to our biological makeup. I have read about many that have results with this medication. I have also read about some that have negative side effects that cause them to change treatment.",bingnune
