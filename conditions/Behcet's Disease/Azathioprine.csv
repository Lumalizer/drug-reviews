0,Azathioprine,Behcet's Disease,8,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 22, 2018",3,"After trying the first couple of medications that are indicated as treatment for this condition without results, my physician decided to try azathioprine. Again, increasing the dosage until I was experiencing relief, we topped out. At the maximum recommended dosage, I still only get some of the intended relief. I wish it worked better for me but I don't have any side effects. Until we can figure out something that is more effective, I'm pleased with the results of azathioprine.",bingnune
