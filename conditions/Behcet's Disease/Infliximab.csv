3,Infliximab,Behcet's Disease,9,,"August 9, 2009",28,"Remicade (infliximab):I have been taking Remicade for approxim ately one year now and find it works quite well for my Behcets symptoms.  Things were great during the initial phase of loading doses but I found once my treatments were scheduled for every eight weeks, I seemed to experience a flare before my next session (Around the 5 or 6 week period).  My doctor has just increased the treatments to every four weeks and we are hoping this will get rid of my flares all together.  The only side effect of the Remicade that I have experienced is fatigue following the infusion.",Anonymous
