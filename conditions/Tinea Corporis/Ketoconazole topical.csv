0,Ketoconazole topical,Tinea Corporis,1.0,,"December 2, 2020",3,"I had a  very negative reaction to the 2% cream. Within 3 hours of the first application, the skin on my forehead, cheeks, ears, and neck turned red and I felt a slight burning sensation. After 8 hours, the skin turned EXTREMELY red and the burning sensation was a bit worse. I stopped applying the cream the next day, but on that day, the skin became very dry and started flaking. On the following day, the skin's flakiness worsened and there were quite a few larger flakes, e.g. 1/4 inch x 1/4 inch and 1/4 inch x 1/2 inch flakes. I washing my skin repeatedly, applied fluocinonide .05% (which I was applying on my skin on other parts of my body), and within 2 days, the irritation and flakiness stopped. My dermatologist believes I may have had an allergic reaction to other components in the cream because I had not had a reaction like this with my Ketoconazole 2% shampoo which I had been using for 3 months.",Floringo2007
