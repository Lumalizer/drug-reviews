0,Terbinafine,Tinea Corporis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 12, 2021",6,"I was on Terbinafine/Lamisil for 12 weeks for a nasty Ringworm infection up my left arm, I had this for almost 1 year. I had tried other anti-fungals (Sporonax) which couldn't get rid of it completely. Lamisil has eradicated this infection for me, am very satisfied and did not experience any side effects.Firstly, I made the mistake of spending ages reading through all the bad reviews here, and had basically convinced myself that I was going to lose my sense of taste, and I spent the whole time worrying about that. If you are like me then I implore you to stop reading this and speak to your GP/Derm instead. I'm not going to discount the bad experiences people have had because of course they are true, but you are reading the experience of the minority. The majority of the millions of people who take Lamisil without issue aren't likely to come here and spend time writing about their opinion, always bare that in mind.",TineaGuy
1,Terbinafine,Tinea Corporis,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 4, 2021",4,"I had 4 spots of ringworm on me one of them had grown a little bigger than the size of a golf ball so my doctor recommended I take Terbinafine pills. It has been six of the 14 days of me taking it and it is so hard on my body. The stomach pains and the nausea are the worst part. I have had a hard time sleeping as well as standing up for longer than 3-4 minutes since I started taking it, any time longer than that I feel as though I am about to pass out. The small ringworms are fading but the larger one is still very much visible, I am not sure if I will be able to continue the rest of the 14 days.",anon
2,Terbinafine,Tinea Corporis,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 20, 2021",4,"I had toe nail fungus from stubbing my toe, I didn't opt for the oral medication and tried the natural route, to mix coconut oil & bicarbonate soda,  bandage it up then air it through the night. It creates an alkaline environment which kills the fungus. Now however I seemed to have got Ringworm, coinciding with the new addition of my puppy Lola in Dec, noticed a couple of itchy bits on my torso that looked more like eczema.  I noticed a ring like area, different to the other areas... Straight to docs, on some miconazole cream, that was useless. Meanwhile it is starting to spread to my horror & disgust. I was getting referred itching. The cream didn't work, now I'm on terbinafine 250mg and three weeks in. It has got worse. I'm washing everything and tumble drying at 60, being super careful, bathing, showering twice a day. I've had no side effects from it. Someone just recommended lamisil cream, but noticed that has the same as the oral meds, terbinafine.",Molly999
3,Terbinafine,Tinea Corporis,1,,"March 13, 2021",2,"TerbinafineStarted on 2/9/21It's like everybody says it is It's a horrible as medicine, it does the job but it makes you horribly sick.I was sick for the first two weeks I took it. I took it for 14 days.It is now 3/12/21 and I'm still dizzy from it not as bad but it was horrible all the way through.Almost like you're on an acid trip.That you can't get out of.And if I knew now what I knew then I probably wouldn't have taken it.But then my feet wouldn't be getting better and they were pretty bad with ringworm.So I guess if you have the same situation you might have to go through it too to get rid of it but it is really bad.Because you're definitely going to suffer.It's like the roller coaster ride you can't get off.You're definitely rolling the dice.Oh and I'm still not better and I don't know how much before I get better.",Joe
4,Terbinafine,Tinea Corporis,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 26, 2021",3,"I shared in December that I started Terbinafine. I took it for 2 weeks, doc recommended, and the spots healed up quickly. I got my taste back just enough to taste sweet things about 2 weeks after. Almost a 3 weeks later, 2 more spots appeared. One in the same exact spot as another. So I'm in round 2 of 2 weeks. I can taste most things, but it's off still. I get insomnia pretty bad and if I drink coffee, 1 cup feels like 12 and I'm active all day.",MCarch
5,Terbinafine,Tinea Corporis,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 10, 2020",0,"I had ringworm on my legs before summer. I got the topical cream and used that as well as athlete's foot spray (helped so much with the itching). But it came back this week on my legs again. I'm on day 2 of Terbinafine now. I'm also battling a cold. So I I lose sense of taste, it's nothing new. But I took it today and was super nauseous and couldn't sit near a window with sun coming in without feeling sick. Keep hydrated for sure, and it helps me if I eat really good before taking it. Only a 3 rating because nothing has happened yet.",MCarch
6,Terbinafine,Tinea Corporis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 10, 2019",6,"Lamisil (terbinafine):This medicine did not help me at all with my ringworm issue. I have not noticed any difference before and after the usage. I was using it for 3 weeks. Before I was using other brand with terbinafine hydrochloride and it works really good. But you don't have that spray in UK, so I decided to try Lamisil.I t's a fail! Hope it helps someone.",Maria1212

The pain in my stomach and constipation was bad and I had to stop half way though the treatment.",Ringworm man
8,Terbinafine,Tinea Corporis,2,,"March 11, 2010",13,"I was prescribed Terbinafine for a Tinea Versicolor rash across my back and shoulders.  It wasn't very noticeable, but it irritated me in a cosmetic sense.  My doctor put me on a two month Terbinafine plan.  I have taken the medicine once a day orally for about three weeks.  As soon as I started taking it, I felt itchy all the time and urinated more than usual.  Then one Monday morning, I woke up covered in hot, itchy hives everywhere.  It's been three days now, the hives are still there, my upper and lower eyelids are swollen and my hands and feet are swollen to the point of pain.  I'd imagine I'm allergic.",Anonymous
