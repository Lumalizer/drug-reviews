0,Ketoconazole,Tinea Corporis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 7, 2019",1,Well I was in Mexico and decided to go to a urologist to check if everything is ok with my balls and penis since I recently got a girlfriend and we have sex. Everything was ok but the doctor noticed some fungus on my penis so he prescribed me with some creme and these pills for medication for 3 weeks straight. Well I took them for 3 days then decided to go on google and found out a lot of negativity regarding these mediciations. I do not want to mess up my liver. I read a lot of side effects that could damage the liver. So I decided to stop using these pills.,Anonymous
