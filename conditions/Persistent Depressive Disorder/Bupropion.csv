0,Bupropion,Persistent Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 2, 2022",3,"I thought this drug deserved to be reviewed since I can honestly say it's saved my life. After a few traumatic experiences back to back in my life I fell into a deep depression. I wouldn't leave bed, check or answer my phone, answer my door, barely ate, I was an absolute mess, I became an introverted shut in, which really wasn't like me. My GP recommended I try an anti depressant and she gave me a few options to look into. Buproprion 300xl seemed like a good fit. Within days I noticed a dramatic change, I actually felt... Good! I regained interest in things, started sleeping better and accomplishing small tasks didn't feel impossible anymore. I assumed I was fine and let my script lapse one time , not a good idea, within a few days I was back at square one and couldn't even drag myself out of bed to goto my GP and get a new script. It took everything I had to go, but I finally went and got back on and within a week I got better again. I've stayed on since and can say I'm happy now.",Eudeepee
1,Bupropion,Persistent Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 10, 2021",3,"Been on bupropion for a few years, I'm in UK, it's not given for depression here. I had to fight to get it. I was glad at the time, it's amazing for erections. I could be there days with sertraline, Prozac, venlafaxine. I might have to go back on something else to stop orgasms, it's really crazy. If you take another med with this it helps you to stop orgasms, on its own omg it's better than, cialis, viagra, you get the horny part with bupropion, but it's too strong and can effect everyday life ie at work your in the toilet a lot lol",Big willie
2,Bupropion,Persistent Depressive Disorder,9.0,,"August 8, 2020",33,"I've been on Wellbutrin or a generic version of the drug for 16 months and I can say it has made a huge improvement. Within the first few weeks I noticed I wasn't over thinking things. I could get things done without self doubt, worry or my mind racing with other thoughts. There was a sense of quiet in my head I was not use to. Sadly though, I started noticing I was having suicidal thoughts which lasted for months. It felt as if all of the happiness had been sucked out of me. I asked the doctor for a stronger dosage. He prescribed me 300mg from the 150mg I was on before. The higher dosage made things even worse.Eventually the suicidal thoughts subsided and I was feeling better than I could ever remember feeling. There was a sense of calm. The saying ""it's all good"" comes to mind. The daily rollercoaster was long over. I woke up feeling good and I went to bed feeling good.",Bear38
3,Bupropion,Persistent Depressive Disorder,8.0,,"May 21, 2020",12,"I am taking 150mg bupropion 2 times daily and it's been a week.  I Idefinitely helps with my depression.  The down side is not being able to sleep, and ringing in ears.  I'm gonna give it awhile longer and hopefully it subsides.",Sis
4,Bupropion,Persistent Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 15, 2020",24,"I have been on Buproprion for over 2 months first 6 weeks I didn't really feel anything, then all of the sudden I started feeling better. I'm 40 yrs old female and I have never had the sex drive that I have now. It's insane,  Ever heard that expression all it takes is a stiff breeze. Also have stopped smoking, it's been way easier than I thought it would be!",Mb

7,Bupropion,Persistent Depressive Disorder,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 19, 2018",15,"Although everyone handles medication differently, I want to just give my experience since I've been consistently on this medication since the beginning of this year. I am in my 20's and have suffered with chronic depression and anxiety since my childhood. Although this medication has helped some with my depression, it had increased my anxiety off the roof. The only positives as of now from taking Bupropion, would be that I've had no weight gain and helped lift some of the fog of my depression. The anger I felt on this drug was immense. Since my doctor added an SSRI to this medication two months ago, my mood swings have levelled and my anxiety and more of my depression is dissipating. Anyways, talk to your doctor please, especially if you have anxiety and are on this medication or planning to begin Bupropion.  I plan on tapering off of this with my doctor's advice, because the negatives outweigh the positives for me on this one.",hopeful21
8,Bupropion,Persistent Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 6, 2018",13,"Bupropion has been the antidepressant I really needed. My doctor decided to have me try it to ""perk me up"" since I am very fatigued and tired constantly as a result of several medical conditions including dysthymia and hypothyroidism, and it's really helped give me a more normal energy level as well as help with my ADHD. I've been taking it for more than a year and haven't had to change the dose; I take 300mg of the extended release version",Anonymous
9,Bupropion,Persistent Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 20, 2017",17,"This medicine has changed my life.  I have energy for my family and friends, I'm much more focused, less irritable, and less anxious.  My doctor tapered my onto the medication so I didn't experience the sleeplessness many have.",mommy q
10,Bupropion,Persistent Depressive Disorder,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 4, 2017",27,"I have been taking this medication for about 2 weeks now. I was diagnosed with Persistent depressive disorder  P.P.D. and have been working with a psychologist along with my PC to get it under control. I have felt sad almost my entire life. So far, with this I have more energy and I'm not as ""snippy"" or short with people. The down side thus far has been the lack of sleep. I wake up at 2 or 3 and just cannot get back to sleep. I have always been a great sleeper 8 hours no issues. But these last few weeks its been more like 4-5 if I'm lucky I get 6. Another side effect I'm noticing is how dry my mouth is, it's terrible.  But that is a small price to pay for not feeling like I just want everyone to go away (I still want that but its a lot less noticeable :P )!",SadDaisy
11,Bupropion,Persistent Depressive Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2016",15,"I'm a 6'1"" slightly overweight 19 year old male... Started taking this medication after being prescribed by my doctor to help me with motivation as I've gained a lot of weight and had become sluggish since about 2 years ago when I was first diagnosed with OCD and social anxiety. My hellish anxiety and insomnia have disappeared after a couple different medications and meditation. What I'm getting from these reviews, generally, is that Day 3 is when this medication takes effect, hopefully this will help me get back in the gym and lose the weight I have gained during the peak of my anxiety. Hoping to go from the fattest I've been in 2 decades to athletic  Will post a follow up in the future, hopefully I won't be a tub of lard! -RJK",OCD96
12,Bupropion,Persistent Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 11, 2016",11,"Got Wellbutrin prescribed for dysthymia, 150 mg in the morning. On the fourth day, after a terrible night coughing, quit my 20-a-day cigarette habit cold turkey. Bupropion does work! The physical cigarette cravings disappear. You just have to fight the habit, which is not easy, but if you say no, well, no it is. And for the dysthymia, perhaps it is too early to tell. Irritation is not as bad as before, but it is more a flatliner feeling than a positive one. Not sad anymore, but not happy either. No bad side effects, perhaps the only one is that you do not sleep as much, so it is better to change your habits and start doing more things during the day and getting to bed later, so you can get at least 5 hours of decent sleep.",Notsadanymore
