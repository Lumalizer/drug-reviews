1,Sertraline,Persistent Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 12, 2019",4,"This medication knocked me out like a horse tranquilizer it still does.  I've developed constant extremely uncomfortable side effects.  A cough that never leaves, severe bloating, apathy as well as feeling no motivation.  Don't touch this pill, its ruined my body and my health !!!!",Jonathan
2,Sertraline,Persistent Depressive Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 16, 2018",5,"My following diagnosis/situation:- PTSD- Chronic Anxiety- Chronic Depression - Recoving drug addict/alcohol addict.Today I started taking sertraline (50mg).This worked for me immediately, and effectively. Because of my tolerance of drug usage this wasn't a big deal for me, because there's a light at the end of the tunnel.I would recommend this for people with more (severe) conditions of physcological disorders.",Supergirl2345
3,Sertraline,Persistent Depressive Disorder,9.0,,"March 14, 2018",20,"I have been taking these tablets for around 2 years now. I think one thing that people need to realise before starting this medication is your not going to wake up the next day feeling a million times better. It’s important to recognise, that as with most anti depressants, you will feel worse before you feel better. This is just why your body recognises the change of seratonin in your body. It’s a very common side effect. The tablets usually will start to work within 3-4 weeks. Just be patient. As with anything you just need to persist. I had extreme lows the first couple of weeks of taking this. I couldn’t even get out of bed but as soon as I settled with them it’s only been positive outcomes since. I don’t worry so much, I don’t overthink situations, don’t feel lonely or helpless any more and most certainly things don’t upset me or bring me down the way they used too. You will still feel emotion. It’s not going to stop this, you just won’t get extreme bouts!",CP93
4,Sertraline,Persistent Depressive Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 24, 2016",11,I have manic depression and anxiety. I was moved to 100mg quite soon after starting it. I got used to 50mg after a week or two. I haven't been suicidal much since the start. They have been really effective.  My side effects have been drowsiness. It used to help with my nightmares but not so much anymore. At first I was extremely thirsty now it's not as bad. I used to get lesions of dry skin everywhere which was so upsetting. But it's gone now. I had itchy skin. But overall its been helpful.,Plush
5,Sertraline,Persistent Depressive Disorder,8.0,,"February 15, 2015",16,"I was diagnosed with dysthymia and mild anxiety. I've been struggling with depression since I was 16 (I'm almost 25).  My mood is just typically low. Recently, the depression skyrocketed and I was suicidal. I decided to try to get medicine this time (50 mg). It's only been 2 weeks but I feel a difference. I described it to my therapist as this: there's a fence and I can't cross it. On the other side is the darkness and desolation, and I know it's there, but I can't get there. It's a strange but riveting feeling. I finally feel STABLE. I can discern and identify ridiculous depressed thoughts. I still get a little sad about things, but it's not to the same degree at all. It hasn't done much for my anxiety but then again mine was mild.",kcomo
6,Sertraline,Persistent Depressive Disorder,8.0,,"September 26, 2013",49,"Zoloft (sertraline):I've been having depressed feelings with anxiety on/off for over 2 years, due to death in the family, pet dying, I retired and was bored and attempted many futile attempts finding a girlfriend. It all piled up and not sure whether the depression started first or the anxiety but it ramped up on me and made me feel sad, anxious, socially inept, lacked interest in doing things I typically enjoyed, all the typical stuff except it led me to the ER one Sunday night because I was feeling suicidal. It's very frightening at 57 to not be in control. I quickly met with a psychiatrist and she prescribed me Zoloft, 25mg to start, increased to 50mg after the first week, and have been at 75mg now for the past 2 weeks and feel so much better.",Thumbs up
