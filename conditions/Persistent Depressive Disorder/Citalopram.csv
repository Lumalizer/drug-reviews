0,Citalopram,Persistent Depressive Disorder,10,,"November 23, 2020",6,"I have Major Depressive Disorder and have struggled with suicidal thoughts since second grade (I am now 21). Even at the beginning of this year I almost took my life. Getting on Citalopram has changed my life. I am happy and thriving Which is so crazy but hey I’m not complaining! I am the top of my class in school and am working 2 jobs while attending school full time. I have never felt happier. This is a miracle drug I swear. I am on 20 MG. The only side effect I have is extremely vivid dreams, sometimes good sometimes bad. But they are so so real and I can control them. I feel all physical sensation as well. And this is every night. At first it was terrifying, but I have grown to love escape into my head and having a fun little second life when I am asleep. It took some adjusting to, but I don’t mind it now. Overall though, being this level of happy and just having to deal with some crazy dreams? Hey, I’ll take it. I’d recommend this to anyone depressed!",Swils

2,Citalopram,Persistent Depressive Disorder,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 7, 2017",4,"I have been taking Citalopram for 5 yrs and have had no side effects.  My sister & niece take the same thing (& same dose) and swear it makes them sleepy.  As for Yawning as another person mentioned, I start yawning every evening @ 8pm.  Regardless whether I'm tired or not.  I've done this long before I ever started taking Citalopram so can probably say for sure it's not because of the med.  I have very little to no yawning during the day.  90% of the time, if I yawn during the day, it's because someone in the house has yawned or I see it on tv...and it makes me yawn.  I also take an antidepressant at night, one which helps me sleep. so between the two, it pretty much keeps me stable.",pooky1962
