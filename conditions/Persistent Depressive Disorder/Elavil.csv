1,Elavil,Persistent Depressive Disorder,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 24, 2012",63,I was taking an SSRI antidepressant and other depression medicines but they didn't work. I started taking this and felt way better than I did before. I've been taking it for a while and got used to the sedating side effects and it's helped me from the first time I took it.,Nikolai
