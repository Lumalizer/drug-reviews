0,Duloxetine,Persistent Depressive Disorder,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 12, 2022",0,"I was diagnosed before 2 years with Permanent depression, Major depression And anxiety disorder.My anxiety was at the worst of my life.I had started with 30 mg for 2-3weeks, then switched to 60mg for almost half a year, then I increased my dose to 90mg.For the last 3 months I am again at 60mg.To tell the truth, I can't imagine how I had been living without cymbalta. This medicine not only saved my life. This medicine made my Life to be worthy.Tomorrow I will visit my psychiatrist and maybe the dose will be reduced to 30mg.If you asked me before a year, I probably rate cymbalta with just a 9 because I was experiencing some side effects (dry mouth, dizziness), But now I am not anymore and the quality of my life is perfect.I can't say If this medicine will work for everyone. But I am happy that it worked brilliantly for me.",Mediterranean
