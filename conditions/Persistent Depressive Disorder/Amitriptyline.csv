1,Amitriptyline,Persistent Depressive Disorder,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 12, 2021",2,"Possibly the best option for Persistent Depression; After many failed trials with SSRIs, combinations of modern antidepressants, and Seroquel, I was prescribed this tricyclic. In last than 2 days and a low dose of 50mg my insomnia AND hypersomnia went away. It was shocking because my problems started when I was only 15 and I am now 27. The cost of this disease on me has been GIGANTIC. Failure in university due to the lack of attendance, many course drop-outs due my to my depression and fatigue. I was already expecting to live a limited life forever. I persisted in doing my own research and considering all options available. This would be my last antidepressant before ECT. Tricyclics are definitely powerful, and what shame most doctors are so resistant in prescribing them for those that don't have pre-existing heart problems! These meds are so inexpensive. I am now going to take 75mg and hoping to stay at this dose, after 2 weeks taking 50mg.",gcarvalhomaciel

3,Amitriptyline,Persistent Depressive Disorder,6,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 1, 2020",3,"Unfortunately never had any sedating effects, but feel okay(ish) at 50mg. Currently titrating up.",Tash93
4,Amitriptyline,Persistent Depressive Disorder,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 7, 2019",9,"I'd been dealing with depression despite already taking Wellbutrin and Seroquel.  I also see a therapist regularly.  I've tried many different antidepressants and have had various side effects that made me discontinue them - I am very sensitive to most medications.  I suffer from fibromyalgia, IBS, interstitial cystitis, headaches, anxiety, and insomnia on top of the depression. So  anyway I was hopeful that amitriptyline might help at least 1 or 2 of these problems, as well.  It helped the insomnia, but it caused hypersomnia and I was sleeping WAY too much.  It did nothing for the other conditions.  I also noticed that I was getting edgy and irritable with my family and I'd cry at the drop of a hat.  I began experiencing suicidal ideations and realized I needed to stop the medication and see if the amitriptyline was the cause.  Within a day, I was already back to baseline.  So, yet another medication I cannot take.",MissLeopard83

6,Amitriptyline,Persistent Depressive Disorder,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 24, 2012",63,Elavil (amitriptyline):I was taking an SSRI antidepressant and other depression medicines but they didn't work. I started taking this and felt way better than I did before. I've been taking it for a while and got used to the sedating side effects and it's helped me from the first time I took it.,Nikolai
