0,Fluvoxamine,Persistent Depressive Disorder,10,,"October 5, 2015",17,"Fevarin (fluvoxamine) 250 mg (150 mg at time of sleep and 100 mg in the morning) in association with 50 mg of amisulpride (Solian, Midora; NOT more than 50 because it changed the effect of sleeping well) with Anxiar 1 gr (both taken at 8 pm) - work great for sleep and dystimia!! Has an anorexigen effect also. I lost 2 kgs in two months, no dieting. Also took the ptsd effects out of my body, the cognitive relaxation appeared after increasing at 250 mgs fluvoxamine.",Maimutze
