0,Triamcinolone,Iritis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 27, 2016",6,"Kenalog-40 (triamcinolone):Chronic uveitis/iritis. Several drops and pills and injections later, the one thing that shows marked decrease between flares for me is this stupid kenalog injection. I would rather do anything that get injections in my eye! They're miserable for a few days afterwards. Not great for active mom of toddler. Want to burry my head in silence, darkness for three days. HOWEVER, I have basically been in a two year long flare, this injection has given me quieter days with my fickle illness. Saved my sight. Lasts about 3 months during rough goes and 8 months during good times. So they say.",uveitismama
