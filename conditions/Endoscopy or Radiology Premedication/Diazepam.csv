0,Diazepam,Endoscopy or Radiology Premedication,7,,"February 8, 2009",17,"I was given the generic equivalent of Valium prior to a closed MRI as I am claustrophobic.  It did not completely relax me during the protracted procedure, however, it did help to some degree.  I only took a 5mg dose; if I were to have to undergo this procedure in the future, I would take a 10mg dose.  One 5mg pill, however, does help me greatly when I experience bouts of insomnia.",Anonymous
