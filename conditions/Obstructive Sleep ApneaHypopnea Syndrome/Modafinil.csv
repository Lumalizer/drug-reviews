1,Modafinil,Obstructive Sleep ApneaHypopnea Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 6, 2021",1,I truly felt I would never feel any relief from this horrible condition but then was finally put on Modafinil 200mg. I can actually smile and am starting to crawl out of this deep depression I've been in for years. This medication can really save lives,NWNINERSFAN
2,Modafinil,Obstructive Sleep ApneaHypopnea Syndrome,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 27, 2021",1,"Older patients clear Modafinil from the body, more slowly, so 100 mg dose is recommended. I began using modafinil at age 55, because Concerta 54mg had begun causing chest pains. I found 200 mg causes sore kidneys. I've been using CPAP for 20 years. I just needed something to keep me awake while driving. I tried both Provigil and generic Modafinil. Neither works for me. So I stick to caffeine tablets, as needed. Herbal supplements help, but must be rotated, to avoid developing tolerance. Canned beets can improve alertness, as well as Focus supplements, priced under 20-USD. I work 2nd and 3rd shift, in a datacenter, with constant 68-F temperature. There are three or four different generic manufacturers. Some forums say the mfgr can make a huge difference. My Rx is only affordable through Walmart, which uses Aurobindo.",jus'hit'60
3,Modafinil,Obstructive Sleep ApneaHypopnea Syndrome,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 24, 2021",1,I’ve been on Modafinil for about a week and it seems to be helping. I’m able to get up and going after about 20 minutes instead of my usual 1-1/2 to 2 hours. I have noticed one thing though; my appetite has gone crazy. I’m always hungry. Has anyone else experienced this?,scottinkga

5,Modafinil,Obstructive Sleep ApneaHypopnea Syndrome,3.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 13, 2020",13,"I have been on modafinil for about 15 years now.  I took 200mg x2 a day while working, and try only to take one a day now that retired (because it doesn't make much difference).  The last five years I have found it hardly works for me anymore.  I use my CPAP regularly, and faithful with checkups.  It seems I can't sit to read or watch TV without falling asleep. If I have a busy day, on the go all day, I am constantly  yawning and feel totally exhausted when I get home. This is really annoying for me because I used to be full of energy, and now feel as if I have used my life supply all up!!",Buster

7,Modafinil,Obstructive Sleep ApneaHypopnea Syndrome,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 16, 2018",5,"If you’re looking at smart drugs, this review won’t help. Modafinil gives me relief after decades of exhaustion from complex sleep apnea. I use CPAP, but the struggle is real and 200mg modafinil 1x/day makes waking up SO much easier. I have to be strategic about when I take it because it does wear off. Anxiety does not appear to be worse than usual when on this dose, maybe bc I feel more in control. For instance, I can easily decide what needs to be done next and it actually seems doable (poor sleep=reduced cognitive function; often I can't quite pin down the best next step & when I can it seems disproportionately difficult).It's not perfect, but it's a big improvement. Relatives who didn't know I was taking it have noted an increase in my energy and focus. The dr. watches my blood pressure while I’m on it but it’s also easier to make better food & drink choices when I’m not about to fall asleep at any moment & it’s been fine.",Sleepy

9,Modafinil,Obstructive Sleep ApneaHypopnea Syndrome,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 23, 2017",3,Was prescribed this for sleep apnea. It made me feel horrible and I had weird sleep hallucinations with it. It didn't make me feel awake it just made me feel weird. Disappointed that I still haven't found anything to help me stay awake during the day.,Tiredlytired
10,Modafinil,Obstructive Sleep ApneaHypopnea Syndrome,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 9, 2017",3,So far this medicine works well. One hour after I take the medicine I feel wide awake and more alert than I have felt in years.  About 4.5 to 5 hours I usually get a headache but I will stay awake feeling fine. I have noticed that when I go to sleep I sleep much sounder and longer.,mddilla
11,Modafinil,Obstructive Sleep ApneaHypopnea Syndrome,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 26, 2016",3,"...continued:I had no side effects other than very slight nausea, just kept me from overeating if anything.I am 225lb and I am VERY resistant to drugs...most seem to have virtually zero effect (Didn't notice anything from Adderral....NOTHING) so my dosages are normally a bit higher than most.Again, it won't make you superman, but it DOES make me feel human again. NOT a human on meth, but just a normal human being....something I had not felt like for some time.8/10 only because I wish it did what those reviews and videos claimed. I wish it made me feel like I have MORE energy than someone not taking it.",IronArcher
12,Modafinil,Obstructive Sleep ApneaHypopnea Syndrome,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 29, 2016",6,"I put off taking Modafanil until I used my cpap for 1 month as instructed by my doctor. I have complex sleep apnea, both obstructive & central & a circadian rhythm disorder, my clock is totally backwards, could be considered sleep shift work disorder but I haven't worked for a few years due to this & other medical issues. I've been doing a lot better but the sleep is the major issue. I tried modafinil 50mg, nothing. I then went to 100mg, nothing. I also tried 50 twice a day, nothing. After about 6 days I started experiencing EXTREME gastrointestinal pains, bloating & distension. I looked pregnant & could barely move because of the pain. I could not pass gas either. It was terrible. I was really disappointed as I heard good reviews here",Sleepy123

I have sleep apnea and have studied this drug for a long time. I decided to ask my doctor if I could try it. I was given the generic brand in Canada because it's fully covered for status Indians.I was given apo-modafinil and not very satisfied with the effects. It did help a bit thou. I then renewed the prescription and they gave me a different generic modafinil,Mar-modafinil. Government changed that. Wow what a difference. I love it! This can be my new love. I first noticed the pill was pill shaped and more dense. It seemed the apo-modafinil was easy to break and disintegrated easy under my tongue. This tells me it probably had alot of filler and less potent. Good stuff.",Italiantribe
15,Modafinil,Obstructive Sleep ApneaHypopnea Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 4, 2016",21,"This stuff is absolutely amazing! I have never felt better in my entire life. I have struggled with fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and depression for the better part of my 62 years. I was constantly tired and always in need of a nap. I could not read a book or watch tv without nodding off. Now I am awake and focused all day long. It is like 5 cups of coffe with absolutely no jitter or side effects. I no longer take or need a nap during the day and my sleep pattern has improved greatly. I used to sleep less than 4 to 5 hours a night. I would wake up at 2 or 3. Now I am sleeping about 6+ hrs. The depression I have endured for 50 years is gone!  My wife cannot believe how much this drug has helped me. It is so wonderful to be enjoying life.",Mtbbob

I was awake and alert but didn't feel drugged....I felt ""on the ball"" and I hadn't felt like that in forever. The second time I took it I felt extremely tired. I forced myself out of bed but felt extremely depressed and anxious. I took anther tablet not realizing I was having a negative reaction to this drug. I became so tired I stayed in bed all the next day. I felt disorientated and it was as if everything was in slow motion. I could not get out of bed and was more tired than I had ever been in my life. My heart beat was fast and it felt irregular. I started to have negative thoughts and hallucinations. Not good!!!",OSA_sleep

I do shift work, suffer from depression, anxiety,  ADD, panic attacks and now this has become progressively worse in the last year.  I sleep so much to catch up that now my 46 year old body is breaking down.  Loss of muscle mass, weight gain, etc.  What does work for me?  Provigil/Modifinil. Amazing!  Truly!

I actually take the medication due to 2 previous head injuries. I have been on the medication for about 4-5 years. During that time I have returned to work and school to pursue a nursing degree. Off of the Provigil I have to take a nap every day, begin to forget things, and fail my classes at school.

Provigil does not affect me the same way in terms of a desire to increase the dose and it is very effective for day time wakefulness and for keeping my focus.  I have had no negative effects from this - only positive.  It is very expensive and if it wasn't for insurance coverage the medicine would cost $1,500 per month if out of pocket.  ",Jimbo7432

So now I take 400mg only on the days when I have class.  That seems to be enough to keep me going on the other days too.

I tried taking an additional 3rd supplemental dose of 100mg a couple of hours after my second daily dose of 200mg to see if the good results might return, but all I gained from the additional 100mg was a headache.
