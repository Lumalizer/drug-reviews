0,Fluocinonide,Atopic Dermatitis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 1, 2020",1,"I've used this medication on and off for eczema like flare ups for years. I have eczema but also a long list of allergies which cause skin rashes. It can be hard to tell the difference between an allergy rash (IDK what all my allergies are, constantly find new ones) or eczema, and sometimes I get both. This medication is the only thing that has ever helped and it works fast. I have found I have to be very careful not to over use it in the winter (aka don't use a few times a week for more than 2 weeks at a time)  or else I get an insanely itchy/panful rash around my mouth jaw and neck that doesn't go away for about two months at a time. Long story short, this medication is excellent for brief/rare/short term use. Try not to make the mistake I made and use it as a ""savior"" lotion every time your eczema flares up if you get flare ups frequently.",sen

2,Fluocinonide,Atopic Dermatitis,3.0,,"August 23, 2014",13,"I've been using it for 5 months now for atopic dermatitis and it doesn't work. Sure it makes you feel good having a prescription medicine and applying it to the infected areas, but the truth is I am no better than when I was using over the counter tar products. I've been through 8 tubes of this cream 0.5% cream and have one more refill to go. What's next?",realunlucky

4,Fluocinonide,Atopic Dermatitis,,,"June 14, 2010",11,"I have rashes on my ankles, calves, arms and I also have itching places without a rash on the palms of my hands and my thighs.My doctor prescribed Fluocinonide USP, 0.05% a month ago.  But it still has not gotten rid of the rashes or itching.  I'll be able to see a dermatologist in about a week, and hope to get some answers then.I am taking a heart medication (Multaq) which warns against being in the sun. Now I'm wondering if it caused me to have a sun-allergy rash.",Grandmere
5,Fluocinonide,Atopic Dermatitis,10.0,,"March 12, 2010",33,"Lidex (fluocinonide):I love this cream! I use it on my back where I had an acute case of Atopic Dermatitis, it cleared up in NO TIME.  Since reading the other ratings, I will try it on my scalp where I have plaques of psoriasis.  I have psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis mixed in on my back and face.",Nissi
