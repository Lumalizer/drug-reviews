1,Prednisone,Atopic Dermatitis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 19, 2019",5,"My eczema has been very severe, and still is, so my doctor decided to give me prednisone. DO NOT USE PREDNISONE!!!!!! If you're taking it on a taper like I did, your eczema will start to come back at the end of your schedule. I took this twice, the first time my eczema came back worse, and then they gave me a smaller dosage, and now it's even more worse. My skin is super dry, the topical steroid they gave doesn't even help it. Its peeling really badly and its painful. Its embarrassing, especially as a teen (I'm 18). I do not recommend, and if your doctor tries to suggest it, bring up the fact that it will only make it worse after you've finished taking it.",Kiya
