0,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 20, 2020",19,"I have suffered from itching for 8yrs and dermatologist didn’t know what to do. I would get itchy  after I would shower, have anxiety, nervousness, heat, anything would trigger it.  It made me so depressed because nobody could fix it I thought I tried every cream, ointment, herb, vitamins , even tried ultra light therapy you name it I tried it. But now this cream saved my life literally I’m so thankful I found a dermatologist that could help me. I called in one day because the itching got so bad it brought me to my knees and she prescribed this clobetasol. I hope my testimony can help someone ... lastly hope this cream can work for u ...",Anonymous
1,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 11, 2018",6,"Only thing that has worked for me so far. I have dermatitis on my  underarms, inner thighs, lower back. Have tried other products but keep coming back to this.",Tati

3,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,9.0,,"March 15, 2016",6,"This treatment is very potent and was very effective for me! I think it is significantly stronger than normal steroids so I never used it for the eczema on my face. However, for the discoid eczema that I've been dealing with for around a year on my hands, arms and legs, it has been very effective at tackling any breakouts or severe redness and scaliness. For me I can normally work see the effects overnight but I find it to be most effective if used for 3-5 days (making sure to use emollients meanwhile) and then to stop for a week or whenever next needed. Definitely recommend if a weaker steroid is not working!",Maximillian90
4,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10.0,,"September 16, 2015",7,"My dyshidrotic eczema has been fairly constant for the past decade. Prior it was caused by food prep (was a cook), now it just is for no apparent reason. I have used betamethazone and cordran tape, with limited results. Dyshidrotic eczema requires strong medicine.  My condition gets pretty chronic with peeling dry patches that often have persistent painful cracking.  Within a couple of weeks of intentional use, the condition gets much better.   It never goes completely away, but is much more manageable.  I apply at night most days, if it has a flare up, then several times a day.  I'm not sure of all of the different ways you can get clobetasol, but I use ointment.  If you need a medicine this strong, be thankful it exists! It gets it done!",dyshidrotic eczema sufferer

6,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 21, 2014",54,"I have poison ivy every year for the last 6 yrs I have seen drs / emergency rooms and they never help me they only told me to used Benadryl. I have it infected and nobody ever prescribe anything. It last for more than a month but this year I went to see a new doctor and he prescribed this cream for me and as soon he applied to my rash I feel the difference is like magic. I went Wednesday night and today is Friday and is almost drying out. Finally something works for me I'm so happy, expensive but worth it.",Anonymous
7,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10.0,,"September 12, 2011",33,My dermatologist prescribed temovate (Clobetason-.05%) for me to use with rash caused by poison ivy.  I get poison ivy frequently and this is the only remedy I have ever found that really works. You can see the results overnight. The rash is completely gone usually in a week or less.,hopalong_30411
8,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10.0,,"December 2, 2009",19,Clobex (clobetasol):Works exceptionally well on body and scalp. The only problem is it is outrageously expensive. I had to go with the generic form.,Anonymous
9,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,9.0,,"September 4, 2009",38,"Clobex (clobetasol):I have tried really almost every corticosteroid medication on the market, including topical triamcinolone and oral prednisone. However, this product is by far the most effective because it immediately reduces the swelling and inflammations caused by my skin disorder, and disinfects the affected area. It also doesn't cause the weight gain and mood swings of prednisone, so it's considerably safer and milder.The only unfortunate parts of this medication are that it can be quite greasy, causing mild discomfort, and can cause stinging when applied, especially if the wound is new. I would highly recommend this to anyone struggling with their dermatological problem.",Severe atopic dermatitis patient
10,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,9.0,,"August 11, 2009",34,I had poison ivy for three months and had been to the Doctor 3 times and had shots and put on steroids and nothing worked.  They put me on clobetasol and within a week it cleared it up.  I was amazed and I kept the box so that if I get it again I will definitely use this cream again.  Wonderful.,weed
11,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10.0,,"July 9, 2009",8,Poison ivy: I've been using the clobetasol gel for canker sores on my mouth for years!  I put some on as soon as one starts to develop and after a couple of applications (especially before bed) they do not develop.  All of my family and friends that get canker sores also use it with the same success that I have!,Anonymous
12,Clobetasol,Atopic Dermatitis,10.0,,"March 23, 2009",20,Olux-E (clobetasol):I was prescribed Olux-E for Psorisis of the scalp.  I made an appointment with a dermatologist because I was embarrassed by the flakes and condition of my scalp.  Symptoms were cut in half after two days of use and gone in four.  I can wear black again!  It still itches a bit but the flakes are gone.  Couldn't be happier.  It is a topical steroid so I'm going to stop using and keep some on hand for the occasional flare up.So impressed.  THANK YOU!,BouncinRound
