0,Luxiq,Atopic Dermatitis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 10, 2021",1,"I used to use this when it came as a foam option. For dermatitis breakouts that left my forehead burning with red blotchy skin, often a single dose of Luxiq would make it go away overnight, entirely. Truly amazing. I only had to use it once or twice during the odd flare up.  The only side effect was initial burning that subsided in about 15-30min. I think they discontinued the foam but you should check as it really helps.",Bro
