0,Dexamethasone,Atopic Dermatitis,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 30, 2020",4,"I have severe atopic dermatitis and major issues with my spine. When I initially started taking dexamethasone, it worked wonders. 10mg’s for a couple weeks then down to 4mg twice weekly. When I started taking it I had no side effects. Now, approximately 4 months later I’m getting almost all of them. Yesterday I had so much anxiety I thought I was losing my mind. Anxious (couldn’t even answer my phone), extremely irritable, major mood swings - those are just the tip of the side-effect iceberg. It’s exactly what happened when I took prednisone.Tomorrow will be my fourth dupixent shot and it seems to be working (at $2400 monthly it should work). I will be talking to my dermatologist ASAP to ask if I can stop taking dexamethasone. Good luck to everyone who is or is thinking of taking it.",DustyFeet
