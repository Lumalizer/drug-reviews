0,Dupixent,Atopic Dermatitis,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 10, 2022",1,"I am a 51 year old female, who like a lot of people who had quite severe dry skin and eczema all of my life - all the usual things, interrupted sleeping, constant itch, hot showers, creams and wrappings. I started dupixent injections in April 2021 and had a fantastic response with the rash and itch clearing up over a couple of months.  However around the 16 week mark I started noticing a strange prickly itch on the soles of my feet. Over the next couple of months I also developed tingling and pins and needles with numbness in limb extremities. The neurologist diagnosed polyneuropthy and is reluctant to blame dupixent but no other reason found. The small nerve fibres are affected in hands and feet which means they are more sensitive to heat and cold. Stopped injections in November. 3 months later the itch has come back and neurologist can't say if nerve damage has been permanent but most likely won't improve very much and I could be stuck with it.",LAL
1,Dupixent,Atopic Dermatitis,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 6, 2022",0,I am just about to get my 6th shot of Dupixent.  I'm very sad to say its not working on me at all.,Pipeysmom
2,Dupixent,Atopic Dermatitis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 25, 2022",0,"This is my first time on an injectable biologic and I was especially scared after reading some of these reviews. But in summer of 2021 I had topical steroid withdrawal (TSW) after 30+ years of using one or another steroid on my face and body. When I stopped the steroids my face swelled up so badly urgent care thought I was stung by a bee. The swelling would be accompanied by extensive itching and weeping that would make my face swell even more and then finally crust over painfully before subsiding, only to happen again 5 days later. Dupixent saved my life because even though it was clear I had to quit steroids, the side effects from the withdrawal were so traumatic and frightening. The first month of Dupixent wasn't easy - my face and chest area turned beet red and was itchy/hot the first month. But once that subsided I had the best sleep of my life as I didn't wake up itching! I'm in my 4th month and the redness/hot feeling is completely gone. No other side effects. Give it a try!",JennH
3,Dupixent,Atopic Dermatitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 22, 2021",0,"My problems with Eczema started in 2010 it was a slow process, years later it advanced so bad I would wake up at night with extreme itch with horrible lesions. I used icepacks at night when it decided to attack me at night, I would take a thin cloth put icepack on my arm and tied it on my arm, after 20 min it stopped, but I cant do that every night, Dupixent came along it was like thank heavens, I'm happy no itch and no lesions but it does lower immune system. If it does tha , what if a cancer cell develops? How will my body fight off with good cells? I got covid this year and was put in the hospital, so to say this there is pros and cons. This did help my eczema but I still worry about the side effects later.",Barbara

5,Dupixent,Atopic Dermatitis,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 6, 2021",0,"Started on Dupixent in January 2021 for severe dermatitis.  The drug was working wonderfully.  My skin had never been clearer, things were going great.  In July I switched jobs and had no insurance for 60 days.  I immediately called dupixent and was told there was a program they would put me on.  I called several times over the course of two months with no answers. NO ONE could tell me where my case was in the process.  Now I have insurance again and still can't get the Dupixent.  Hours  and hours of phone calls and can't get a straight answer.  In the meantime my skin is worse then ever.  Every time I call I get the runaround about what needs to happen next.  I have done everything on my end and still no Dupixent.  I have never dealt with more incompetent people.  Good drug, but terrible customer service.  I will be looking for a different treatment.",DAVE

A few months ago this drug become affordable in Australia. I started a few weeks ago after waiting a few months to see my specialist. I have slept for 8+ hrs 3 nights in a row which I have not done since I can remember. My skin does not feel like i am a crocodile and is 50+% better already. I have been able to move my neck without pain and pick stuff up from the ground. I have even done some star jumps to celebrate with minimal pain. No side affects as yet so fingers crossed my life has changed. THANK YOU DUPIXENT!!!!!!!,Cannon
8,Dupixent,Atopic Dermatitis,1.0,,"April 12, 2021",2,"I tried this drug. First of all, the needle used for injection is extremely wide and big. It was very painful when the nurse injected the medicine. Second, this is very expensive.  I should not have to endure that much pain with very, very little results. It also made my gastritis worse. I will not be taking this drug ever again.",Bobbi
9,Dupixent,Atopic Dermatitis,8.0,,"March 17, 2021",5,"I have had AD all my life (36 yrs). Started with Dupixent in Feb 2021. Amazing results after 3 injections.But some side effects:- headaches (may be due to steroids stop)- weakness, need to sleep a lot- weight gainI did a blood test 3 days before starting Dupixent and then before my 4th shot to assess the impact of this new medication.I was surprised with an important decrease of my lymphocytes level (white blood cells) - that are now under the normal rate. Lymphocytes are the backbone of our immune system and I thought that Dupixent doesn't have any immunosuppressive effect.I think that I will continue using Dupixent as it really changed my life, but will try to space as much as possible my injections otherwise I am scared to destroy my immune system. I have already seen feedbacks where people have succeeded to do it once every 8-9 months.Anyway, Dupixent is a miraculous medication and I am very thankful to the research team for this progress in treating atopic dermatitis",Lili

However, I began to develop large red blemishes around my neck and on my face. At first they did not itch, then a week later it was like my condition came back but twice as bad. The weather also got very dry and cold at this time so at first I wasn’t sure if it was the weather or the medicine. Now, 2 months later, my bad condition still persists and I have developed seborrheic dermatitis, which I’ve never had before. I feel the medication is to blame for this and I will be discontinuing Dupixent.

In May, I had a flare covering both palms and soles of my feet.  They are still flared after 8 months and now I am getting rashes on my back, under breast and arm pits.

I was literally up all night itching, and showers were excruciating. I decided to go on Dupixent because topical treatments were no longer working for me. Within the first month on Dupixent, my body was basically clear and my itch had drastically decreased. However, within about 3 months, I did begin to notice some unique looking rashes on my face and around my eyes. Fast forward to 6 months later, and my eyes are indeed watery and itchy like others have mentioned, but it's not totally unbearable yet. I got in contact with my dermatologist, and he said that there is a theory that Dupixent basically uncovers an allergy to ingredients that  are commonly present in cosmetics and lotions.

She has helped me to remove as many allergic triggers as I can and I believe that also helps keep the flare ups away.  The best thing to come out of taking the Dupixent is the absence of the constant itchiness and irritation.  I have had one flare up since being on the medication and it was super mild.  I have been so fortunate that I have not experienced the side effects that I keep reading about.  I did have excessive watering of my eyes and when I had a glass of wine my face was briefly flushed but I will take that over the everyday suffering.

My body had been about 80% covered in red patches and all of it cleared. After 1 month passed I started experiencing terrible side effects. Including conjunctivitis, blepharitis and cracked skin on eyelids. I saw an eye doctor 3 times and was put on steroid eye drops. Later I saw an ophthalmologist to ensure my eyes weren’t being damaged by the steroids I was using. Luckily no significant damage was done, but side effects persisted. At the end of the 6th month I decided to stop. The side effects were outweighing the benefits. After being drug free for 2 months, my eczema hasn’t flared up at all. I am still suffering from the eye problems but I am hoping time will heal. My advice is, if you start feeling better don’t be afraid to stop the needle and start again at a later date if needed. You may have been experiencing a flare and once under control can be managed using other creams and less harmful options.",Linds

He did a complete eye exam. Ophthalmologist  had to look up Dupixent when I told him it was one of the side effects of this medication. He suggested antihistamine otc eye dropcalled zantidor. Been using zantidor and still my eyes have not cleared. Saw noticeable improvement in my skin after first 2 doses but unfortunately stopped using dupixent due to severe eye irritation. Now what? My eyes aren't getting better and the dermatologist has gone back to topical corticosteroid can someone please tell me what to do about my eyes?",Mickey

About 2/3 of my body was covered and I couldn't walk, eat, or sleep without pain. Triamcinolone, prednisone, you name it, no effect. I started on Dupixent in October of last year and there's been nothing but huge improvement since then. It took about 3 months for the effects to really take hold, but since then I've been down to just very mild eczema in a few spots (above my eyes, behind my ears, and my inner elbows). It's been an absolutely life changing drug for me. Only complaint I have is how much of a nightmare it was to get my insurance to cover it. Once it was though, I qualified for the manufacturer's copay card which covers up to $13,000 in out of pocket cost per year, so I currently pay nothing for my monthly prescription.",Amanda
