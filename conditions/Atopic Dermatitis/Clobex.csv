1,Clobex,Atopic Dermatitis,10.0,,"December 2, 2009",19,Works exceptionally well on body and scalp. The only problem is it is outrageously expensive. I had to go with the generic form.,Anonymous
2,Clobex,Atopic Dermatitis,9.0,,"September 4, 2009",38,"I have tried really almost every corticosteroid medication on the market, including topical triamcinolone and oral prednisone. However, this product is by far the most effective because it immediately reduces the swelling and inflammations caused by my skin disorder, and disinfects the affected area. It also doesn't cause the weight gain and mood swings of prednisone, so it's considerably safer and milder.The only unfortunate parts of this medication are that it can be quite greasy, causing mild discomfort, and can cause stinging when applied, especially if the wound is new. I would highly recommend this to anyone struggling with their dermatological problem.",Severe atopic dermatitis patient
