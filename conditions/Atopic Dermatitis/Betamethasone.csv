0,Betamethasone,Atopic Dermatitis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 10, 2021",1,"Luxiq (betamethasone):I used to use this when it came as a foam option. For dermatitis breakouts that left my forehead burning with red blotchy skin, often a single dose of Luxiq would make it go away overnight, entirely. Truly amazing. I only had to use it once or twice during the odd flare up.  The only side effect was initial burning that subsided in about 15-30min. I think they discontinued the foam but you should check as it really helps.",Bro
1,Betamethasone,Atopic Dermatitis,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 19, 2020",2,"When did a cream become an ointment? I used this cream around 2000-2001 was very good and absorbed into the skin and left skin soft non oily, now 2020 and oily non absorbent and seams to have changed formula ,still a good treatment but NOT as good as was.",bob
2,Betamethasone,Atopic Dermatitis,10.0,,"February 6, 2020",4,I have suffered with various forms of eczema flair ups for 25 years. I recently had a severe hand flair up and my dermatologist recommended several new ointments to try which did not work. Out of desperation I asked him to prescribe a cream (not ointment!!) that I had used 10 years ago which worked great for me. He looked at my chart and said it was Betamethasone Cream. I applied it last night with vinyl gloves on and this morning my hands have improved 40% in one night. Only cream that works for me.,Relief
3,Betamethasone,Atopic Dermatitis,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 9, 2019",8,"I used betamethasone for a year. It kept everything in control and after a while I noticed something terrifying. Using this cream is such a a bad idea and a trade off but idk what else to do. :( Side effects include:- Thinning of skin- burning sensation and redness- you stop sweating in that area where you apply, and these effects last for months after repeated use- It thins THE SKIN which makes it feel like paperI’m super upset on how it worked decently for a year and then I think once my body’s gotten used to it, it stings now every time I apply it due to how thin my skin’s gotten and my inability to sweat and cool off during my exercises.",Temp relief
4,Betamethasone,Atopic Dermatitis,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 18, 2017",4,"I've used an assortment of medicated creams and ointments in my lifetime of battling eczema. Currently this is the one that keeps it mostly controlled. It doesn't eliminate it altogether, but it works well. I apply it at night and put gloves on (nitril gloves), which helps significantly since my hands are what is affected and it is really difficult to keep medications on long enough otherwise.",Zippyt
5,Betamethasone,Atopic Dermatitis,1.0,,"April 25, 2017",2,Betaderm cream has not helped at all. The rash is now processing up the side of my face. I have oily skin and this cream is very thick and oily. Probably the wrong thing for me. It is expensive since I don't have a plan and I was given 2 jars where one would have been more then enough to experiment with.,123defense456bgcswthc
