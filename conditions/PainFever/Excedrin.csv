0,Excedrin,PainFever,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 9, 2019",4,Excedrin is my go to for headaches and general aches and pains. When it wasn't available for almost a year I tried everything else. Nothing works as good.. I even prefer it over some  prescription medications for pain.,Dennis
1,Excedrin,PainFever,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 2, 2018",3,"It does work beautifully to relieve awful headaches, but the side effects are enough to make me use this medicine only as a last resort. The aspirin in it gives me nosebleeds and bruises, and the caffeine, while not a lot at 65mg, hits me much harder than caffeine from coffee for some reason.",sereneceline
2,Excedrin,PainFever,,,"March 1, 2018",1,Took Excedrin for headaches but it causes ulcers 3 times was put in hospital for bleeding ulcers. It works great but not worth being put in hospital.,Terry
3,Excedrin,PainFever,9.0,,"May 1, 2010",5,I have used for at least 15 years with excellent results for head and body aches.  The Extra Strength is great in the morning since I don't drink coffee.  It relieves the morning bodyaches and gives you a perk up.  I use the Back and Body at night. There's no caffeine and you don't get the 'side effects' of evening medications. Only drawback is occasional stomach bleeding (evident in stools) and occasional heart burn.  Works better than Vicodin for me.,ccalvert

5,Excedrin,PainFever,9.0,,"May 7, 2009",6,"It is the only medicine I had fast results with and more effective of all the prescription medicines I have tried in the past, but it has irritated my stomach a lot.",edwar morelos
