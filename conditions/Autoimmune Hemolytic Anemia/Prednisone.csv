0,Prednisone,Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia,8,,"February 8, 2020",4,"Started on prednisone 60mg daily for autoimmune hemolytic anemia. My HGB was at 5 when I finally got checked. Over about 9 months we tapered down to 5mg dose and my HGB was still up to 11 from 5 and my LDH went from 1700 to 170. Once I got to the 5mg dose I was feeling better and getting my energy back. A couple of weeks later I got off the prednisone and started kickboxing and lost about 15 of the 20lbs I gained and my moon face was back to normal. I was doing good for about a 6 weeks or so then one day after a kickboxing class I had a lot of SOB so I asked the dr to recheck and sure enough my HGB is back down from 11 to 8.8 and my LDH went from 170 to 488. So I’m back on prednisone 60mg. I will recheck my labs in 1 week and hopefully the hemolysis has stopped and we can start tapering down again. I just honestly hate being on prednisone it makes me hot, I have night sweats, I’m very easily irritated, gives me the shakes  I feel bloated and gross. On top of the weight gain and moon face.",Anonymous
1,Prednisone,Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 18, 2019",4,I have been taking prednisone for the past 13 years for autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Doctor has stopped me from doing blood transfusion since it doesn't help in maintaining my red blood cells levels. My hemoglobin would only goes up to 7 or 8.nTherefore the doctor asked me to take prednisolone 5 mg once a day and it does help to get my hb to 7 or 8 but it will not go down unless I didn't take it and I'm on high stress level. I was not told my doctor beforehand that if I stopped abruptly.. It has side effects. I did stopped and it affected my one eye. And now I can only see with one eye due to the effects of prednisolone. it really frustrated me.,Nila

In hospital for about a week and on drip for a few days then 90 mg of Prednisone for a month then a year , had the moon face, weight gain and insomnia until I got down to about 10 mg, reducing .

4,Prednisone,Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia,7,,"February 14, 2010",22,"I have been taking Prednisone for about 6 weeks - 40mg per day. I think the side effects are directly related to the dosage. I read so much about this drug and the awful side effects before taking it and was scared to death to start. It actually hasn't been as bad as what I read. The biggest issue is sleepliness at night - def have trouble sleeping but have tons of energy.  A little face swelling too but not the ""moon face"" I read about. And its working for my Autoimmune disorder.",Anonymous
