1,Erythromycin,Pharyngitis,10,,"April 5, 2010",6,My experience at first was that I was not able to take the chewable pill. It was quite distasteful and difficult to swallow. I switched to the liquid and this made a huge difference in my digesting of the medication. The medicine proved to be quite helpful. I was starting to feel better after the second day of taking the medication. ,ladiid
