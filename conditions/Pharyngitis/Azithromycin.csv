0,Azithromycin,Pharyngitis,1.0,,"August 30, 2020",0,"On Wednesday night my throat started hurting and burning.  It wasn't until Friday I decided to go to the Doctor.  Because of the Covid 19 situation my family physician wouldn't see me in the office so I went to the ER.  The doctor prescribed Azithromycin 250mg tablets and a pain reliver tramadol 50mg.  I picked up the medicine at about noon Friday and took it as soon as I got home.  I thought it was a miracle drug because by dinner time I was pain free.  However, I woke up Friday night (Sat. morning) with the returning pain with a vengeance.   It's now Sunday morning I'm wondering if this med works and if I should go back to the ER.  The pain get worse at night, and I can't get any sleep.  Have contacted my private physician by e-mail and waiting for response.",Ed
1,Azithromycin,Pharyngitis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2018",0,Zithromax (azithromycin):Taking Zithromax (Azithromycin) Teva 250Mg 6 Day Pack. Gave me diarrhea even with food. Made me feel odd and uncomfortable for some reason. Also noticed that it had marked day 4 on the back of the pack on my last tablet. Don’t know if I had to take it in order or not but did notice it said day 4. Other than that I guess it kind of work feel a little better nothing really noticeable.,Adrian
2,Azithromycin,Pharyngitis,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 3, 2018",2,"Found these reviews because I was searching to see if I was the only one who had terrible diarrhea from taking these meds! Took the generic Riva brand one (6 x 250mg, 2 pills the first day then 1 per day). It seems to be helping the Strep Throat as my fever seems to have subsided, my throat is a lot less sore and I’m starting to cough up the mucus, but man does it make you run to the washroom. I’ll continue to take it because it’s better than having my throat feel like it’s on fire but be warned!",CoughityCough

6,Azithromycin,Pharyngitis,,,"August 31, 2014",0,"Zithromax (azithromycin):I began taking Zithromax today for Pharyngitis, however, it made me feel sweated and nauseous for 45 minutes. I felt like that I want to lay down in the living room not in the kitchen, because I was nauseous and unwilling to relax myself instead. Yet, I got mucus. I was able to stay awake and focused at the all time anyway. At the end, nausea disappear and my stomach became empty and was more willing to stay seated.",Anonymous
7,Azithromycin,Pharyngitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2014",7,"I caught a really bad flu (maybe H1N1 - it was going around in my city). It started with a dry cough which led to violent coughing within a couple days. Violent non-productive cough, where I got coughing fits that went on for about 30 seconds,  which is really long when you're coughing.  Anyway, I had chills and a fever and muscle aches and sweating.  A few days later I lost my voice completely for 9 days. My regular doctor didn't give me anything. So I went to another doctor the next week when I could barely breathe. The doctor told me to go to the ER. I asked the ER doctor for Z-pak as I knew it worked on me when I had pneumonia before.  Amazingly, Z-pak started making me feel better after 2 days. After the full course, I was so much better.",2014FluWasBad
