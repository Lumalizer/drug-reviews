0,Zithromax,Pharyngitis,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2018",0,Taking Zithromax (Azithromycin) Teva 250Mg 6 Day Pack. Gave me diarrhea even with food. Made me feel odd and uncomfortable for some reason. Also noticed that it had marked day 4 on the back of the pack on my last tablet. Donâ€™t know if I had to take it in order or not but did notice it said day 4. Other than that I guess it kind of work feel a little better nothing really noticeable.,Adrian
1,Zithromax,Pharyngitis,,,"August 31, 2014",0,"I began taking Zithromax today for Pharyngitis, however, it made me feel sweated and nauseous for 45 minutes. I felt like that I want to lay down in the living room not in the kitchen, because I was nauseous and unwilling to relax myself instead. Yet, I got mucus. I was able to stay awake and focused at the all time anyway. At the end, nausea disappear and my stomach became empty and was more willing to stay seated.",Anonymous
