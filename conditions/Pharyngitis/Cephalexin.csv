1,Cephalexin,Pharyngitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2018",0,"Had terrible abdominal pain the entire time I was on this antibiotic. I donâ€™t know if it even worked because I was on it for only five days but it did nothing for me. Had to take bactrim after this course was over and started to feel better. Best suggestion is to eat when taking it, take probiotics, and drink water.",Rosemc16
2,Cephalexin,Pharyngitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 5, 2016",2,"Was prescribed Keflex (cephalexin) as treatment for strep throat. Had always been given penicillin prior with no side effects. After 1 full day of dosing I noticed a recurring itch on chest. Chest was speckled with tiny red spots and looked as if I had gotten into insulation or something similar. Went to bed and awoke to a full on rash over entire body that resembled mumps, eczema,  or chickenpox.  Not pleasant at all to see, to say nothing of the unbearable itchiness. Did not experience any anaphylaxis or tongue swelling. Prescription was switched to penicillin that morning at doctor office and rash subsided in a few days. My children have been prescribed this recently and I have not handled dosing them for fear of contact with drug.",R Buffington
3,Cephalexin,Pharyngitis,8.0,,"October 16, 2009",7,"I am taking this drug for pharyngitis. So far it has worked, well to be honest with you the main thing that helped my swelling was the GI cocktail they gave me at the hospital. So far this has helped in my opinion. I am experiencing what I believe to be a side effect of slight pain when I urinate.",.......
