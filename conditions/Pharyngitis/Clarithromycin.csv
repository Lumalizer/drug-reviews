0,Clarithromycin,Pharyngitis,10,,"March 26, 2018",5,"Wow, I can't believe how much this drug is downrated. ""oh boo hoo, I have a bad taste in my mouth and a headache, medicine sucks"". You're sick. Chances are that your condition is bad or it is getting there. I would like to have a headache for a week than be hospitalised for pneumonia if left untreated.I've been prescribed this drug a few times since I was 12 and every time I tried to man up to the illness and not letting it get to me until it worsens and I had to take meds. Antibiotics like this one are godsend. 7-10 days and I'm back on my feet again. I got to point out that you can't even say if the ""side effects"" are from the med or from the illness and/or the process of your body healing from it. I would have been dead at least a few times if it weren't for this lol. It's nature in the first place that put you in this situation. A few years ago if you got tuberculosis, you were pretty much a goner. Thank you ""BigPharma""!",Yung Dud
1,Clarithromycin,Pharyngitis,10,,"May 14, 2015",1,The drug is good. Been under weather for months and sore throat swollen glands for 6 weeks. Doctor prescribed this. Partner thought I was suffering placebo effect because it honestly makes you feel better within one or two doses. Given 9/10 rating for effectiveness. However side effects are rotten. Last time had erythromycin ended up dialling 999. Apparently this is same family. Maybe I am susceptible to it. Been awake at night with the awful taste and heartburn. This morning heartburn is worse than pregnancy and have four days left. Am drinking water and lemonade and that seems to help the taste. Nausea is awful on a morning even when I ate last night's with chip butty and ginger biscuits.,haggis79
2,Clarithromycin,Pharyngitis,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 24, 2015",2,"Within 24 hours of taking these tablets all the pain had gone away and I felt much better.  Gave me an upset tummy but more than worth it.  Avoid taking on an empty stomach,  I felt sick for a short while after taking them on day 1 when I didnt feel well enough to eat",Jane.k
