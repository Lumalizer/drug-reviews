1,Itraconazole,Aspergillosis Invasive,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 27, 2020",17,Was put on itraconazole after numerous other antifungal medications failed and it was found that I have invasive aspergillosis. I’m a type 1 diabetic (aka immunocompromised) and so far this is the only medication that has worked for this infection. I have yet to finish the course of medication but I am already feeling so much better. I’m shocked because all other meds have failed.,SuspiciousPinkCat
2,Itraconazole,Aspergillosis Invasive,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 12, 2017",26,"I was prescribed this medicine as I had become increasingly ill despite countless courses of oral and IV antibiotics and oral steroids.  They discovered that I had aspergillosis and I have now been on this medication for almost 18 months.  I did try to stop it after about 9 months as I was advised it was very toxic to the liver but I became very ill again.  It has quite literally saved my life & I can recommend it based on my own experience,",Blonde angel 33
