0,Paxil,Dysautonomia,8,,"May 27, 2011",20,"I started taking atenolol 12.5mg for my near syncope condition.  I was having near fainting spells-took a tilt table test and starting feeling bad after 18 minutes.  I was given a stressor around that time and then passed out.  I needed more than the atenolol to be able to function and work, etc. so my cardiologist put me on 10 mg Paxil.  I had to up it to 20mg and have been on this cocktail of medicines for approximately 4 years now. I have some moments when I feel lightheaded but nothing severe. This has been working for me pretty well though.",Amy4
