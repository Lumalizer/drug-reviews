0,Nortriptyline,Dysautonomia,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 25, 2021",3,"At first it seemed like the medication was helping only because it was making me drowsy enough to actually get sleep, but the longer I took the medication the more apparent it was how wrong this drug was for me.  After about a month of taking the medication most of my dysautonomia symptoms got worse and worse and I even developed severe depression which I never had.  By the time the Dr. took me off the drug it had made me much more symptomatic than I was before I started it.",Andy
1,Nortriptyline,Dysautonomia,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 2, 2017",5,Rx for dysautonomia and possible neuropathic pain. Immediate reaction was an extreme dry mouth. So bad that talking my lips stuck to my teeth. Then the urinary pain and pressure. I thought I had a UTI so I went to Dr. UTI test normal as we were discussing possible kidney stones he read I just started this drug. Told me to stop and come back if no change. 2 days later those symptoms cleared.,Oneofeach
