1,Alprazolam,Dysautonomia,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 23, 2019",13,"I suffered for years before my Dysautonomia diagnosis. I was treated for migraine auras. Told I had conversion disorder and that I was having seizures. Fast forward to last week sudden on set of convulsions and my insides feeling like they were vibrating non stop. I have SFN and the burning mouth had been unbearable for weeks even with 3600mg of Neurontin.  Transported twice to ER where they treated me horribly. My Dysautonomia specialist told me to take half tab of Xanax  (alprazolam) at first feeling of jitters or convulsive warning and it works, I feel almost normal after a week of this. I already take 1mg at bed time and have since May. I am able to continue working full time because of how well this controls my surges. Before finding a doctor willing to prescribe this for spasms these episodes could carry on for months. I am grateful.",JJ

3,Alprazolam,Dysautonomia,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 19, 2018",24,"I have a form of dysautonomia, anxiety/panic, Heds, insomnia, chronic pain, muscle spasms, hypothyroidism, and a bunch other stuff. Xanax or forms of benzodiazipams seem to help with anxiety, hyperhydrosis, heart rate, feelings of someone standing on my chest. Within 15-30 mins my symptoms go away and I can go on my day like a normal person. My doctors don't listen of my concerns with this being so helpful. They just want to try to set me up to try things that I've tried in the past and it never worked.",Greatfuldeads
4,Alprazolam,Dysautonomia,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 13, 2017",23,"This is the only med that keeps my adrenaline surges under control.  This is a Godsend for Dysautonomia specifically Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) patients that have no control over when the ANS decides to release adrenaline putting us in ""overdrive"" with flooding anxiety. I also take other meds SSRI and beta blockers. This one is crucial in my day to day functioning.",Potsgirls
5,Alprazolam,Dysautonomia,8,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 8, 2016",10,"Not only does it help my anexiety, but it also helps to relax the muscles in my back.  I broke my back in 2002 was sent home on a Saturday morning at 10 am from a 15 foot fall breaking my 2 and 3 lower lumbar vertabras in my lower back.  I was given 2 demerol pills for the whole weekend, and told to go see my family Dr for full time pain management.  Thats Canadian Health Care for you.  Wouldn't even give me a perscription to get me through the weekend just 2 demerol pills.I have been taking four 0.5mg a day and I have been able to cut my pain medication in almost half ( Fentanyl and Dilaudid.)",Cherrie0777
6,Alprazolam,Dysautonomia,10,,"August 15, 2016",17,"Alprazolam (Xanax) helps me in way more the one. I quit having blood pooling in my arms and legs, no more being lightheaded all the time, I can actually stand comfortable for more than 3 minutes, and I don't feel like I'm out of breathe and can't breathe! Before I started taking xanax I was bedridden most of the time and that's a difficult task when you have a 5 and 8 year old!!! But yes, alprazolam has saved me!",Pots Princess

8,Alprazolam,Dysautonomia,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2013",50,Xanax XR (alprazolam):Helps anxiety symptoms that POTS (A form of Dysautonomia) causes. Someone else who reviewed Alprazolam said it helps to keep them sane with their Dysautonomia. I have to agree; it also helps to keep me sane. I'm on Xanax XR 2 mg once-a-day. Also helps insomnia caused by POTS with the adrenaline surges. Have combined Xanax XR with Tramadol and I can function a lot better now!,DanielLJ
