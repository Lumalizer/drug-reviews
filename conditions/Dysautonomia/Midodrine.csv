1,Midodrine,Dysautonomia,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 26, 2018",31,"I give it an eight because its not for everyone and because I do get side effects like irritable mood, more headaches, body pain and stomach upset but aside from that, it is a life-changing drug. I am no longer fainting 4-5 days a week. I can stand up for more than 30 seconds without fainting. I can think. I can be active for 4 or more hours per day instead of 1-2. I can drive a car without getting tired and confused. It has given me my life back after 24 years of not living!",SusanT

3,Midodrine,Dysautonomia,9,,"May 17, 2017",24,"If there's a side effect to be had from a drug, I'm the type to get it but other than initially making me nauseous, this medication is not one I can go without!  It has allowed me to function from debilitating dysautonomia.  While I'm not 100% yet, it has helped me get my life back. Started on 2.5 mg three times a day but I am up to 15mg three times a day.",trihealth
4,Midodrine,Dysautonomia,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 9, 2014",51,"I started taking Midodrine early last year and like others before me have said...it's the best thing since sliced bread! I had to get out of the military because of bradycardia and vaso-vagal syncope and I was taking fludrocortisone at the time. The Florinef was awful, my hair was falling out, my nails were tissue paper thin (and painful), and I was still passing out every time I stood up. Midodrine has allowed me to do the things I love! I am a serious bowler (trying to go pro) and without this awesome stuff. I wouldn't be able to bowl more than one game (and very slowly) without passing out. I can also take showers STANDING UP! *GASP!!!* What a concept! It's a lovely medication! My only quabble is the tingling on my head.",Le Me!

6,Midodrine,Dysautonomia,9,,"November 6, 2010",52,"After trying a few other drugs in combination, adding midodrine was what enabled me to get out of bed and sit up without fainting, dizziness and drastic hypotension.  I can now stand and walk, and participate in life when before, I was bed-bound.  Yes, I now have very itchy, sensitive skin and scalp; but I will gladly suffer that slight annoyance to be able to function. I am glad its a shorter acting drug, even though I have to dose in the middle of the day, because it gets out of my system before I go to bed and don't change from hypotension to hypertension.",jamernay
7,Midodrine,Dysautonomia,9,,"September 29, 2009",70,"ProAmatine (midodrine):This medication gave me back my life. I was passing out everywhere. People in Target hated to see me coming. I passed out in a parking lot and prayed I wouldn't be run over. I had hypotension and vaso-vagal syncope upon movement. This didn't ""cure"" it, but helped me so much.",lvnpeace
