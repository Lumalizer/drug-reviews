0,Fludrocortisone,Dysautonomia,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 4, 2021",3,"I have orthostatic intolerance, with suspected low blood volume and dysautonomia. I just wanted to share an odd side effect of fludrocortisone: it gives me a bicarb soda taste in the back of my throat and it also gives a bicarb soda smell to my faeces.I am only on a half dose (0.05mg) so far because my doctor wants to be very cautious, so I can't say whether it is helping with my OI symptoms.In the first week of taking it, I had a metallic taste in my mouth and a slight nausea, but this went away. Now got the weird bicarb effect!",Sarah T
1,Fludrocortisone,Dysautonomia,6,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 30, 2020",5,"Started fludrocortisone .1mg 1/2 pill twice per day, first dose at breakfast then again around lunch. Stops the dizzy spells, orthostatic hypotension and lightheadedness while standing extremely well but did increase resting BP from picture perfect to high normal. It doesnâ€™t do much for fatigue and I also take with hydrocortisone for the adrenal insufficiency.",Mr. misdiagnosed
2,Fludrocortisone,Dysautonomia,7,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 18, 2020",7,"I've taken fludrocortisone for almost 10 years.  It helps a lot with orthostatic hypotension.  Questionable impact on breathlessness with exertion or mental fogginess.  It does require monitoring blood pressure.  The medicine can cause BP to be above normal, healthy levels.",Middle Aged Guy
3,Fludrocortisone,Dysautonomia,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 24, 2018",6,I took this drug for around 1 year. I am in my early 20s. While taking it I developed pneumonia and chronic yeast infections. Awful experience. Don't take it,Lulu
4,Fludrocortisone,Dysautonomia,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 6, 2013",24,"After being a serious athlete my whole life and winning 10 k races last spring,  I suddenly developed autonomic dysfunction (Dysautonomia) about two months ago at age 66.  I am taking 0.1 mg Florinef per day, half before breakfast and half around noon.  I am functioning much better with the medication.  I also drink extra liquid and two 11 oz cans of V8 juice (920 mg Na per can) in morning.  I have been able to continue working full time as a professor, something that I would not have been able to do without the medicine.  Swimming is my only good option for aerobic exercise, so I am doing laps for 30 min 4 or 5 days a week.",simon the cat
