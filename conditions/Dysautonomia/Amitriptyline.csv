0,Amitriptyline,Dysautonomia,8,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 31, 2014",20,"Improved neurological functions, less flare-ups of the autonomic system.  Helps - body temperature regulation has become a little better, able to sweat a little now, able to swallow now with no problems, hand tremors a majority of the time, and about half the adrenaline rushes than before.  Does not help - sleep, heart rate and blood pressure, GI problems (gastroparesis, stomach pains, or constipation), heat intolerance, brain fog (memory problems).  Has had to increase medication a few times, but am still on it.  I am still on this medication and would not want to go off this - I have seen improvement.",JumpJump
