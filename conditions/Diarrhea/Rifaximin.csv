4,Rifaximin,Diarrhea,10,,"June 29, 2008",43,"Xifaxan (rifaximin):I have been battling diarrhea for over 10 years.  My GE doctor prescribed asacol, vsl#3, and xifaxan.  I took all in combination and had almost instant relief.  Then I stopped taking the prescribed drugs for 6 weeks and the symptoms started to return. I resumed taking vsl#3 and asacol with mediocre results.  I then added xifaxan and my bowel movements returned to normal. I wonder how long and how frequently I will have to take this drug before I am permanently cured of this condition.",sid49

I noticed a huge change in the range of foods that I could eat, and the level of chronic pain and diarrhea I was having, after taking a full course (which left me broke).",Anonymous
