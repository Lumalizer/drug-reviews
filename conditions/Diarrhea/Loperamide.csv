3,Loperamide,Diarrhea,9,,"February 23, 2020",16,Imodium A-D (loperamide):If Imodium doesn’t work for you then you might have Bile Acid Diarrhea BAM So you need Cholestrymine.

6,Loperamide,Diarrhea,1,,"April 28, 2019",9,"The old formula worked great. I could always count on it to stop any diarrhea by the second dose. The new formula doesn't work at all. I've tried it many times. I've even tried using more than recommended, but to no avail.  It's a waste of money.",Bigdog
7,Loperamide,Diarrhea,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 12, 2019",14,"Imodium (loperamide):Made my symptoms much worse. Every time I took it I'd get diarrhea immediately after.

I started taking Imodiun and started itching  and a rash. It did help the diarrhea but I am one of the people that had a reaction to this medication, unfortunately. I also had cramping, and sweating as well as lightheadedness.",annie47
10,Loperamide,Diarrhea,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 14, 2016",30,"Imodium A-D (loperamide):I have had IBS-D most of my life. Until Imodium came along, I had to stay home... I use the Imodium Multi-Symptom more often than the Imodium AD for one specific reason - the ease of accessing the pill. The packaging for the AD is absolutely, beyond a doubt one of the dumbest every conceived! Definitely not something you can have handy in your purse or wallet. You'd never be able to get to it in an emergency. You have to use scissors to cut the tiny pill out! But, with the Imodium Multi-Symptom, you simply bend the corner at the perforation, pull the paper back and access the pill. It is a larger pill so for people who have difficult swallowing, you may want to buy a small bottle of Imodium - no individual packages to mess with.",diymel
11,Loperamide,Diarrhea,1,,"June 13, 2016",12,"Imodium A-D (loperamide):The new packing is impossible to open. I cannot open the packet. Did you ever hear ""if it a'int broke don't fix it""? Why did you change? I like the product now I need to find a new one.",pepto

30,Loperamide,Diarrhea,10,,"March 25, 2009",33,"I was born in 1958 and have had intestinal pain since I was a child. I thought it was just part of growing up and never told anybody. As a young adult the pain became to much to handle and I started seeing all kinds of doctors. To make a long story short loperamide controls the pain I had to endure for years. Better than prescribed medicine and at a much better price. I have been taking it for a good twenty or so years now. I do not wait for the problems to start, I take one in the morning and one at bedtime everyday. If I feel an intestinal virus coming on I double it. It is very rare now for me to get that double over pain for hours. To me it's a miracle drug.",Anonymous
