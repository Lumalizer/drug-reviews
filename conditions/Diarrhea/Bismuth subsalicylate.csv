0,Bismuth subsalicylate,Diarrhea,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 7, 2018",24,Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate):I was so sick from a stomach virus going around my city including my own doctors office staff. I literally felt like I was dying. My wonderful neighbour brought me a bottle of Pepto Bismol and after the first dose I immediately started feeling better. I couldnâ€™t believe it as I had been delirious only moments before.,Jb

2,Bismuth subsalicylate,Diarrhea,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 13, 2016",29,"Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate):As a college student with moderate IBS symptoms/overly sensitive stomach, sharing one bathroom with four people can REALLY be scary. Instead of having to climb out the window and run into the woods or bang on the door begging for mercy, popping a couple Pepto Tablets can REALLY help relieve the symptoms of impending doom. Mellows my stomach out within 5 minutes of taking, doesn't taste bad and gives me a sense of safety. Sometimes, your stomach still gets upset much later, which at that point is completely fine-it has to come out sometime, right? Generally speaking, it's usually great and I never get the upset stomach! I recommend to anyone, it's saved me many times and can do the same for you.",Saves the Day for You!
