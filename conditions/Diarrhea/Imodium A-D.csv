0,Imodium A-D,Diarrhea,9,,"February 23, 2020",16,If Imodium doesn’t work for you then you might have Bile Acid Diarrhea BAM So you need Cholestrymine. It’s horrible first month makes thing worse then bam your all good. As far as Imodium you have to take two and then after the next poop take another one and this will completely stop you up.,Dez
1,Imodium A-D,Diarrhea,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 1, 2016",13,"I was tappering off of both MS Contin and Percocet and developed diarrhea. I started taking Imodiun and started itching  and a rash. It did help the diarrhea but I am one of the people that had a reaction to this medication, unfortunately. I also had cramping, and sweating as well as lightheadedness.",annie47
2,Imodium A-D,Diarrhea,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 14, 2016",30,"I have had IBS-D most of my life. Until Imodium came along, I had to stay home... I use the Imodium Multi-Symptom more often than the Imodium AD for one specific reason - the ease of accessing the pill. The packaging for the AD is absolutely, beyond a doubt one of the dumbest every conceived! Definitely not something you can have handy in your purse or wallet. You'd never be able to get to it in an emergency. You have to use scissors to cut the tiny pill out! But, with the Imodium Multi-Symptom, you simply bend the corner at the perforation, pull the paper back and access the pill. It is a larger pill so for people who have difficult swallowing, you may want to buy a small bottle of Imodium - no individual packages to mess with.",diymel
