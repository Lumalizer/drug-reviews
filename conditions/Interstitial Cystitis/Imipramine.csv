0,Imipramine,Interstitial Cystitis,9,,"November 15, 2009",93,"Tofranil (imipramine):For 3 years I have been battling bladder cancer. My bladder has shrunk, the pain has been great, the need to urinate is every 15 minutes or so. I have had 9 biopsies, some malignant and more recently 3 in a row benign.  I have interstitial cystitis and started using Tofranil 5 months ago.  Over the course of those 5 months Tofranil has gradually eliminated the pain and lengthened the time to urinate to once per hour.  To me, it is a miracle drug and I continue to take it with no side effects whatsoever.",LUCCA
