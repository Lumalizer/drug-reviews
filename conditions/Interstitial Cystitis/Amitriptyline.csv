0,Amitriptyline,Interstitial Cystitis,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 2, 2022",0,"Been taking amitriptyline for a little longer than 6 months now and for me it doesn't work.The pain and urinary frequency is still very much present and side effects are the reason I will stop taking this medicine. I have gained about 15 kilograms in weight since starting this medication. The other side effects are dry mouth, dry eyes and an overall feeling of lack of energy.I'm glad to see it helps for a lot of people but I guess my IC is just too complex for this to work.",Glen
1,Amitriptyline,Interstitial Cystitis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 29, 2021",1,"A close relative was diagnosed with IC some two years ago.  We live in Sydney, Australia.  Referral to a Urologist was a slow tedious process of the usual discussion re medications, bladder distension and then bladder irrigation.  All with little to no effect.  The patient, a young man in his mid twenties became depressed about the discomfort as well as the social consequences of this very disruptive disease.  The Urologist involved had very little sympathy for the effects of the disease upon the patient in terms of psychological well being.  He did not want to treat the disease with amitriptyline.  After two years of extreme discomfort the patient approached a sympathetic GP who agreed to trial him on 10mg of amitriptyline.  The results were spectacular.  The pain and discomfort had improved by 80% within a week of a daily dose of Endep (ami).  Improvement has continued with only mild tiredness in the mornings.",Sam
2,Amitriptyline,Interstitial Cystitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 13, 2021",1,"I didn't realize how bad my interstitial cystitis was until I started taking amitriptyline. All of my horrible bloating, headaches, and other symptoms I thought were normal, turned out not to be. I have been experiencing IC symptoms for years, and I thought it wasn't that serious until I was relying on Azo and other pain killers for relief pretty much every day for three years. I finally went to a urologist and she diagnosed me with IC, and to start taking 10mg of amitriptyline as well as a managed diet and pelvic floor exercises.  About three days after taking it I had no pain! I didn't look like I was six months pregnant anymore because of my bloating, and my headaches stopped! I got emotional, IC and it's symptoms became so normal for me that I forgot what it was like to not be in pain. The only downside I have experienced so far is dry mouth and drowsiness, but I take it in the evening so it isn't really a problem.",Lulu
3,Amitriptyline,Interstitial Cystitis,8.0,,"October 27, 2021",1,"So it all started in January of this year, 2021. I saw a SP who prescribed me with Amitriptyline. She didn't do any tests to diagnose IC, just told me to take 10mg and then increase to 20mg for 3 months. After I stopped taking the medication my symptoms were worse constantly urethral burning. I then decided to see a different SP who I saw in September. I then had a Cystoscopy with hydrodistention and urethral stretch. I was so uncomfortable after this and my burning still continued. I am now waiting to start a course of Ialuri bladder instillations. During the past 9 months there are times when I have felt like I have been living in a nightmare. The burning was that severe I started having suicidal thoughts. If it wasn't for Azo,which I purchased of Amazon I don't know what I would have done. Tonight I have decided to start taking my left over Amitriptyline as I have come to the conclusion when I was taking this medication I was in control and yes it did alleviate my symptoms.",Lobby21

5,Amitriptyline,Interstitial Cystitis,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 30, 2021",3,"I got diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis about 5 years ago had loads of tests, bladder investigations and a stretch but no one mentioned taking Amitriptyline. I was using a natural remedy D-Mannose which helped but if I got a bad episode it did not. I then had a fall 3 years ago which caused a rotary cuff injury - I was given Amitriptyline 10mg. I'd been taking it until about 4 months ago. During this time I had no episodes of Interstitial Cystitis but did not realise it was because I was taking the Amitrptyline! - 2 weeks ago the symptoms have come back with a vengeance again - I researched on what to take for Interstitial Cystitis and discovered why I had been pain free for 3 years. I just got my Amitrptyline today. The only side effects whilst on this medication was a dry mouth ( I can deal with that) and was a little groggy in the morning. Will try taking it earlier now as a previous reviewer suggested. It also helped with my moods and made me much more happy. I live in the UK.",Nadide
6,Amitriptyline,Interstitial Cystitis,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 27, 2021",0,"This drug completely eradicated my pain with interstitial cystitis. Unfortunately I noticed mood changes and was much less driven, less personable, etc.  After 10 months the swelling in my face made it very round and I decided to take myself off the drug.  Tapering off was easy. No bad side effects.  I would be hesitant to take this drug again because it has the ability to really shift your personality.

Been on this medication for 3 days and it has worked, ALL MY SYMPTOMS are almost completely gone. I had a lot of burning and pain. So far this is the only med that helped me almost completely. I only take half a 25 mg pill. So far it covers me. Had no side effect yet other than dry mouth and a little fatigue. I tried uribel, black seed oil, two alfa blockers (silodosin, tamsulosin) and quercetin. None helped the way this medication did.

8,Amitriptyline,Interstitial Cystitis,8.0,,"May 15, 2021",3,"I really just wanted some advice. I have been on OAB medication and recently now being treated for IC. My urologist does not know which one it is so it’s trial and error. Anyway she prescribed a strong anti histamine and 10mg of Amitriptyline. I have to take the anti-histamine daily and Amitriptyline only when I get a flare up. I am confused because you all seem to be on Amitriptyline on a permanent basis. The internet says not to just stop taking it.  I have taken it for 3 days and my symptoms have gone so according to my urologist I should now stop until the next flare up, so not sure what to do?",Catherinehemming

10,Amitriptyline,Interstitial Cystitis,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 13, 2021",3,This is a wonder drug for Interstitial Cystitis pain but unfortunately it resulted in an allergic rash on the trunk of the body. I was using it in a compounded ointment applied directly on the bladder area. Worked great in combination with Baclofen (muscle relaxer) as a second compounded ointment. Had one month of great pain reduction but also took a month for amitriptyline to accumulate in system and cause an allergic rash. Doctor (pelvic pain specialist) insisted that this drug was not the cause of rash and urged me to go back on it. I did and two days later rash reemerged all over again so I am definitely allergic to it.,Yogalady

I take Amitriptyline at night 30 minutes before bed. The timing of when you take this medicine is important. I accidentally took it one morning and couldn’t function. You HAVE to take it at night only. I only take 25 mgs. I’ve been on the same milligrams since day one. I’ve not had one panic attack since I started this medicine 11 years ago.

I tried Elavil when I was first experimenting with therapies (others included Physical Therapy, Elmiron, Baclofen suppositories, bladder cocktail, Ditropan, elimination diet) a lot of stuff to say the least lol. And eventually I was cured! Since I tried so many different things I wasn't sure which one fixed me. But I had no more pain or bladder issues and I discontinued all drugs for a long time...over a year! Then sure as the world the issues and pain came back. My doc put me back on Elavil after struggling with the issues again for over a month. I kid you not after ONE dose I was back to normal and in remission again. This stuff is great and WAY cheaper than other therapies! Thanks Elavil! I didnt give 10 starts because it makes me sooo sleepy but I will take it over the pelvic floor and bladder pain!",Chellie

My symptoms include painful intercourse, pelvic pain, burning urethra. I tried Elmiron and it made my symptoms 10 times worse, so I stopped within three weeks of my start date. I recently was prescribed Amitriptyline 25mg and I have been on it for a month. I take it at night around 9 PM and find that it makes me drowsy. It also keeps me in a deep sleep (which I love). In the morning, it is a little harder to wake up, but once I am up, I am fully functional and not tired. During the first two weeks, I didn't experience any relief, but by the third week, my symptoms disappeared.  I am in shock that something actually worked being that I have tried almost EVERYTHING. I now can drink an 8-ounce cup of coffee a day and not feel any burning or pain when I urinate.

Normally, I wake up in horrendous pain. I have been taking Prelief and pyridium, but recently that just doesn't take the pain away. I am so thankful there is something out there that works!

If the people who make Endep ever read this , PLEASE do something to reduce the side effects because this is such a wonderful medication for those of us who have IC, but the side effects are just to much to deal with.",JT

I thought that was the end of it, but it returned this year.  I went to a urologist immediately, told him about my past and he put me on 25mg of Amitriptyline.

I even tried gums, toothpastes and mouth washes designed for dry mouth but they did not help and were too expensive.

Side effects for me include grogginess, but that´s wearing away the more I take it and, for sure, a huge spike in my apetite, which I´ve had to be careful about as I don´t want to gain weight on it. It´s not a miracle drug, but it worked for me, and I think anyone suffering from this condition should give it a try.",anagum

I changed my diet, was put on Elmiron, Zyrtec and Vesicare with zero relief in any symptoms. Was at the end of my rope when my PCP suggested Elavil.  In 3 days my symptoms were nearly gone. Pain was gone. Urgency/frequency cut in half.  But I immediately started gaining weight. A lot of weight, and fast.  And I am diabetic and any weight gain is very bad for me.  So I've had to choose to not take it and live with the pain and constant peeing because I cannot afford to gain any weight due the diabetes.  I'm basically distraught.  Diabetes will kill me, but the Interstitial Cystitis pain is causing major depression.  I am at a loss as nothing else has worked.",SweetMimi

Bottom line--it works.  It really does.  I still have the frequency but the pain is almost completely gone.  There have been some days when I feel the pain but I take an extra dose and it helps so much.  I do have to say though, it makes me tired, I've gained about 30 pounds and waking up in the morning is harder than ever.  Still, it's worth it.",IC Patient

I took the meds for about 2 weeks but could not handle the side effects of confusion and listlessness. I quit taking it for a long time and suffered with the frequent urination. I was at my wits end (no sleep!) and found the old pill bottle of amitriptyline in my drawer.  I am no longer working so I decided that I would give it another try since I didn't have a schedule to keep.

61,Amitriptyline,Interstitial Cystitis,7.0,,"June 7, 2013",27,I began on Amitriptyline about three years ago I think? Started at 25 mgs with the option of increasing to 50 mgs for bladder Interstitial Cystitis. Because of weight gain I stayed mostly at 25 mgs nightly rather than increase the dose. But recently I have increased my dose back up to 50mgs. It is helping with the pelvic and bladder pain associated with Interstitial Cystitis at about 65 percent. It is not though helping with the frequency of urination around the clock as for so many years. But the relief with my abdominal and bladder discomfort is improving at present. For me that is a God send. My other medical and health challenges I am plugging away at. ,Lady Caution
