0,Phenazopyridine,Interstitial Cystitis,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 8, 2022",0,"I've been struggling with IC for a few months now. Bladder instillations did not help. My doctor recommended phenazopyridine, as well as an anti-depressant at night time (it's thought to relax the bladder). I noticed a difference. On a scale of 1-5 (5 being the worst), I was brought down to a steady 2. There were brief moments of even feeling like a 1. This was a win for me. I just ran out of my phenazopyridine about two days ago and my bladder urgency has begun creeping back. I was really hoping I wouldn't have to continue with medicine, as I just don't like being dependent on them, but here we are. I just called in a refill. So far only side effect is the strong yellow/orange urine. I think this medicine should come with free panty liners!I would like to know though-- is taking phenazopyridine everyday bad? I hope that this is just temporary and my bladder will begin to heal itself and perhaps I will only need phenazopyridine when flare ups occur. Thanks!",rams

4,Phenazopyridine,Interstitial Cystitis,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 7, 2021",0,"Recently I started taking Azo Standard which seemed to work fine. It cleared my symptoms but noticed that I had extreme dry mouth. Figured it would eventually go away.  Like Azo products so I decided to try their Bladder Control. Started to take about 2 days after finishing the Standard. Again experienced extreme dry mouth but with some added issues. My eyes were very dry and itchy and I did notice slight discoloration. My eyes looked and felt tired. My skin overall was dry to the point of itchiness. Had leg cramps at night and sometimes during the day.   All of these symptoms started happening towards the end of taking the Standard but I brushed it off to change in weather, dust etc.  I started taking the Bladder Control about 2 or 3 days after. I did follow the directions. Still didn’t think Azo was the problem so I continued taking it until this past Friday 11/5/21.

7,Phenazopyridine,Interstitial Cystitis,8.0,,"November 11, 2020",17,"Uricalm (phenazopyridine):I decided to give these pills a try after I still had some lingering symptoms after finishing UTI antibiotics from my doctor. Though my urge to urinate wasn't as bad and I wasn't in pain anymore, I was still having some discomfort. Uricalm worked like a charm but make sure you eat a FULL MEAL before taking the two pills. I made the mistake of only eating an apple beforehand and nearly threw up and then had diarrhea. Thankfully, the latter wasn't painful (I also have a really sensitive digestive system, so you may not experience those symptoms at all), but I would still eat something substantial. Even with these symptoms, my urge to urinate frequently was already gone. Later I tried taking the pills after having a sandwich and I was completely fine. It turned my urine bright reddish-orange, but aside from that, I felt completely back to normal again. I definitely recommend if you're just coming off of a UTI like me or are experiencing UTI symptoms but can't get to a doctor just yet.",geol

It always helped until Bactrim kicked in. In 2004 I got a UTI and pain never went away. Saw a urologist who specialzed in interstitial cystitis (IC) and was diagnosed with IC. Since then I've had many infections. Azo without cranberry helps with certain bacteria but not others. I'm in my 60's and this is now a killer on my stomach. But if I'm in a lot of pain I'll take just one with food. I noticed when cultured it aggravates sometimes and works for others. AZO is acidic and so are some strains of bacteria.
