4,Zenpep,Pancreatic Exocrine Dysfunction,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 21, 2020",21,"Like my mother, I have had duodenal ulcer, heart burn, and symptom of EFI and steatorrhea for many years. Otherwise, I don't have pains, and I don't know if I have pancreatitis or CF.   Without medicines, I would have 3-5 bowel movements every day, and it is extremely painful when I travel, which I do very often.So I started to take Zenpep, which is very effective without any obvious side effect.  When I travel, 3-4 capsules of  20000 Unit (the green capsules) with meal will keep me safe for most of the day.  But the worry about the side effect of long period of usage pushs me to find alternative medicine.  The luckily, I found that by chance, the non-prescription 3-400 mg of capsules of Nattokinase (3-4 x 2000 FUs) with meal has the same, if not better effect to keep me dry for most of the day.   Hope it helps anyone who may need it.",GZKOM
5,Zenpep,Pancreatic Exocrine Dysfunction,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 22, 2017",30,"I was diagnosed 2 years ago with stage 4 pancreatic cancer.  I have had chemo and radiation and I am doing very well.  When first diagnosed I was on Creon I had no side effects but wanted something a little less expensive, so my Oncologist suggested I try Zenpep.  It works great, as long as I don't forget and skip a dose, when I skip a dose all my symptoms come roaring back, gas, pain, cramps and loose bowls.",Sue English
