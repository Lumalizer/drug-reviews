0,Albuterol,Asthma Maintenance,2.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 27, 2022",0,Salbutamol inhaler works very well for me but Albuterol does not. It's supposed to be the same thing medication but the aeration/spray delivery seems much stronger. I'm going to see if I can out the Albuterol into to the Salbutamol case and see if that increases the strength of delivery and effectiveness.,LyricalP

I used my Teva inhler 20 times in 24 hours still needed breathing treatment.  One puff on my husband's and I was fine. Why is there such a difference when the medications are supposed to be the same. I will be paying full price from now on. Will NEVER again use a Teva inhailer.  It should not be this hard to breathe with a treatment.  This is the worst breathing product I have come across.",MamaG

I was recently switched to the generic form, yellow container with an orange cap, and it is truly awful!  The spray is very, very weak and ineffective, even with two puffs.

5,Albuterol,Asthma Maintenance,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 8, 2021",1,ProAir HFA (albuterol):Apparently I’m not the only one who has experienced the disappointment of being forced to switch from Ventolin to Proair by insurance. I’ve used Ventolin since I was young for chronic asthma. I used to use Ventolin once a day. The Proair tastes disgusting and it actually makes my lungs feel worse immediately! It then works but then I feel like I have to use it again in a few hours. It’s making my lungs worse. I’m going to have to pay for Ventolin or somehow appeal to my insurance company to cover it.,Jaz

My insurance company switch me to a generic. It was terrible. I’d get 20 puffs and it would clog. Ran it under the water, it still didn’t work. After 3 canisters wasted I called my insurance company and let them know the danger they put me in by forcing the generic on me. I called the pharmacist and told him I need prosit and would pay the difference. Insurance to heed after he called them and told them about the canisters I had returned.

7,Albuterol,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 2, 2021",7,"Ventolin (albuterol):Omg! I thought I was the only one. I only started googling out of frustration. I usually wake up during my sleep feeling breathless but I'm not getting a sufficient dose of ventolin with this couter. I didn't think anything of it at first but now that I've used it for some time, I hate it. I'm having to use so many puffs and still not getting enough and then panic because I'm stressing and can't breath. This new ventolin is ineffective and whoever came up with the idea should be sacked. I don't think the creators realise that when you're short of breath, the first metered dose doesn't go past your throat and it's the 2nd puff that gets down to help relieve you. I found the other comments very helpful and will be looking to get an alternative without the counter.",breathless

(Generic, proventil, proair hfa)I suggest you NOT use if, like me, have sensitivity to stimulants (caffeine,etc), anxiety, adrenal, heart, or panic attack issues, or like me it will likely aggravate all of them, even with one dose as it does for me.With regular use, as my MD directed (because I forgot past experience), my nervous system became so agitated that not only could not sit still, my whole body felt like it was vibrating, and triggered a physiological (not cognitive/emotional) panic attack where I struggled to breath and my heart rate stayed high and exceeded 175bpm and stuttered with slightest physical activity, well above the recommended max of 157 for age 63.

I do not know if I am suffering from Asthma or Bronchitis. I have had this wheezing for a whole year now after I got a bad throat infection. I am never out of breath, however, it helps open my airways at night, and the wheezing tends to subside. It also helps me cough out any phlegm that I might have, hence less wheezing when sleeping. The negative side effects; upper arms pain, muscle spasms, light headache. So far I haven’t had any problems dismantling the canister off for cleaning, which I put under running warm water.

In April, BCBST switched me to the generic by Perrigo. After about 8 times of using it, it clogged up, I kept trying and I just thought I got a bad one. So I got another one. Luckily, when I went into a full fledged asthma attack from dust and mouse droppings while cleaning out a garage, I had my Pro-Air in my purse and it saved my life. Had I had the Perrigo, I would have ended up in the ER. I took the inhaler back to my pharmacy but they said they could not do anything. She told me to try and rinse it out with hot water. I tried hot water and vinegar and still it is clogged. I cannot risk it. I have to pay out of pocket $65 for Pro-Air.

Had to contact my pharmacy and pay to get my old inhaler that I knew worked and gave me relief in a time of need. I contacted the FDA.

I used the Dulera once in the morning and once at night. Ventolin in emergency situations. The Dulera helped manage my asthma. When I did need to use the Ventolin inhaler, it delivered a strong blast that opened up my airways. As mentioned before, my job's rx plan stopped covering it. So I had to use my inhaler more often. Then they stopped covering the Ventolin. When I had to get the ProAir, I noticed the difference right away. The blast was very weak. Plus the container gets clogged 8/10 times. My son has asthma as well and he has autism. What is one of us or both have to use this cheap inhaler and nothing comes out?

I had to google videos on how to use this while I'm almost dying trying to figure this out. Once I guess I figured it out, it was terrible, they mention it's some powder, and I had to do 5 inhales, which is ridiculous, because if I can't breath, how can I inhale this?
