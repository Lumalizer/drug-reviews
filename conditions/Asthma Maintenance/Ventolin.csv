0,Ventolin,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 2, 2021",7,"Omg! I thought I was the only one. I only started googling out of frustration. I usually wake up during my sleep feeling breathless but I'm not getting a sufficient dose of ventolin with this couter. I didn't think anything of it at first but now that I've used it for some time, I hate it. I'm having to use so many puffs and still not getting enough and then panic because I'm stressing and can't breath. This new ventolin is ineffective and whoever came up with the idea should be sacked. I don't think the creators realise that when you're short of breath, the first metered dose doesn't go past your throat and it's the 2nd puff that gets down to help relieve you. I found the other comments very helpful and will be looking to get an alternative without the counter.",breathless
1,Ventolin,Asthma Maintenance,3.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 20, 2021",21,"I have used ventolin for around 35 years and since the counter was introduced, I no longer find my ventolin puffer effective and flare ups are now common. It is like the doses are smaller and I often need additional doses for relief. Would be great if we had the choice to buy either counter or counter free versions.",Bec
2,Ventolin,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 23, 2019",3,"Does not work have had this for months. I take it when I suffer from breathing on my bad days, 2-3 times those days but notice no effect. In the docs office they have given me rescue inhalers that work for me but this is what my insurance covers, I plan on trying to change when I go back.",Jacqueline
3,Ventolin,Asthma Maintenance,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2017",9,After taking this for the first time (prescribed by my doctor due to coughing and wheezing from the flu) I can't even begin to tell you how amazing I felt. I have always felt a little tight / heavy in the chest. I always got out of breath quicker than other people around me. When I took this - I felt like years of bricks were lifted off my chest. I had once thought that the heaviness in my chest was my heart - but now I know all along it was my lungs and that I probably had undiagnosed allergies I'd been living with and ignoring. What a relief !It began working within 5 minutes.,My chest felt light as air
4,Ventolin,Asthma Maintenance,9.0,,"May 17, 2016",8,Helps control allergy related inflammation of my throat and related airway. Ventolin pump seems to work better than others in delivering medication deep into throat area.,Clt resident
5,Ventolin,Asthma Maintenance,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 24, 2013",24,I have been using ventolin going on for about five years now and I have had no complaints.  It works within about fifteen minutes and really helps me breath better.  Though when it does get to the end of the canister it doesn't seem to be as effective.,anonymous704
6,Ventolin,Asthma Maintenance,8.0,,"December 9, 2010",27,"I use it, have for a real long time. I am on maintenance, I don't need one daily, have in the past and know that I may again. Well either maintenance or regular it has always been a big part of my life and it works very well. Where would I be without it?",Annie's Momma
