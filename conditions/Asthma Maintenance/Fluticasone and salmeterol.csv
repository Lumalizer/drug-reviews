1,Fluticasone and salmeterol,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 22, 2022",0,"Wixela Inhub (fluticasone / salmeterol):VA put me on the Wixela Inhub and just like many other peoples reports it does not work well.  Part of the problem may be that you have to inhale hard likely causing a Venturi Effect  in which the powder flows through an open to constricted pipe, in this case, my lungs.  Please remove this product. It is not effective.  I used Symbicort for many years with no problems.  Now I am taking 5 - 10mg of Prednisone which I don't like.  I typically lead an active life to the degree that I can and using the Wixela Hub has hindered my well being.",Jim
2,Fluticasone and salmeterol,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 14, 2022",0,"Wixela Inhub (fluticasone / salmeterol):Started on Advair as a kid, switched to Breo as an adult because Advair costs increased as I switched insurance providers. Five years after that, I had to switch back to Advair because Breo was no longer covered under my new employer-based insurance, but Advair was. Both Breo and Advair were great for my asthma maintenance. Fast-forward a couple of years to last December when I, once again, switched insurance carriers due to a career change- Advair is no longer covered so I was put on Wixela. I have been using it for about 3 months now and it is a joke. I may as well not be using anything at all. Shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, wheezing.. and having to use my rescue inhaler just so I can walk a mile. I questioned whether I was using it correctly so I re-read the instructions and made sure to follow everything precisely- no change. Maybe the inhaler construction is limiting the delivery of the medication, but it is not worth it. Wixela was a mistake.",Dissatisfied

I rescheduled hoping for nicer weather.  No one seems to believe or care what the feeling is when you just can't breath.  FDA needs to look at this drug again, and throw it out.

I thought I had Covid the nurse even said the Wilexa is rubbish. I kept trying to get my doctor to change me back to Symbicort it takes an act of God to put in a request to the pharmacy then I got a letter with a box of a higher strength of the rubbish so I tried the higher dose For about two weeks and it’s even worse. Before I was only using Symbicort and rarely a rescue inhaler so I went to patient advocate and thank God after five days I got Symbicort in the mail So just tell your doctor to put in a request for Symbicort and then when you get denied or if he doesn’t put the request in go to patient advocate at your VA and I guarantee you you’ll get back on Symbicort hope this helps,Wixela

A few months back the VA switched to Wixela. This is the worst drug on the market, and is primarily for Asthma, not Emphysema. How the VA could approve this is a good question, although the new VA Administrator seems to be doing everything he can to cut costs, rather than to properly treat veteran's health.  My breathing has gotten so bad I have had numerous xrays and scans to see what's wrong, and I can hardly take a deep breath. I am now on home O2, as I can hardly breath without it. I can hardly walk anywhere, limiting my ability to take care of myself. The VA has offered a replacement as a trial, rather than going back to Symbicort.

I went online and learned that Wixela should not be used by folks with hypertension, cardio-vascular issues and thyroid problems.  I have all three, having had a heart attack two years ago and my meds were keeping me stable until I started the Wixela.  My COPD is worse than ever, and my rescue inhaler has been resurrected and in my pocket, along with my nitro.

To save money, I switched to generic AirDuo 232/14 which was released at the same time as the brand AirDuo and is supposed to be the same. 232/14 is the highest dose of AirDuo available and is supposed to be equivalent to Advair 500/50. Fairly quickly, my asthma deteriorated and I got an unpleasant reminder of what life is like when breathing takes a lot of effort despite using the maximum allowable amount of albuterol daily along with a Qvar steroid inhaler. Fortunately, ditching the AirDuo and switching back to Advair quickly got me back in control without need for anything else. If you're on a lower dose of Advair, AirDuo might work for you but if you're on 500/50, I'd be very careful about switching.",Useless
