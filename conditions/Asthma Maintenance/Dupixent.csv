0,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 23, 2022",0,"Prior to taking Dupixent, I was on a low maintenance dose of prednisone and on top of that required a high dosage burst of prednisone from 2 to 5 times a year to stabilize my asthma symptoms, specifically severe cough and shortness of breath (low peak flow).  I had nasal polyps that required two prior surgeries and a history of frequent sinus infections.  After a brief period of taking Dupixent I backed off the prednisone maintenance dose.  For 2+ years I have not needed to take any prednisone to manage my asthma symptoms.  I still cough but peak flow is perfect.  No deterioration in nasal polyps and no significant sinus infections.    I have had no noticeable side effects at all.",Bob A
1,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 23, 2022",4,"I started with Dupixent (300mg) over a month ago for severe asthma.  Within several days both of my arms and hands felt like they had been slammed by a sledgehammer and both hands were constantly burning.  The pain was indescribable.  It only began to subside two weeks later, when the next dose was due.  I decided to go for it and see if this problem would continue.  Unfortunately the pain and burning in both arms and hands came back with a vengeance.  I called my doctor and we both agreed to stop the Dupixent.  Now the pain and burning are gone, thank goodness!",Bren
2,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 22, 2022",0,"I have had severe asthma since birth. For the last few years I have developed remodeling of my lungs. Basically my lungs are damaged making it hard for me to breathe like emphysema. Like others I have to be on steroids a lot. I have tried a lot of meds and shots, nothing has worked. I've been on dupixent for a month. Still having problems breathing. I have noticed increased heart rate, especially the first few days after the shot, skin problems, aching in my joints, fatigue and now for 2 days my eye hurt, I can't see, poor vision very red, oozing and feels like a pencils in my eyes. I really want to give it a chance and hope the symptoms will go away.",Lynn
3,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,8.0,,"December 28, 2021",1,I have had really bad asthma since I was a kid and mild copd . I have been on symbicort and ventolin for my years. Using my Ventolin as much as 10 times a day. Also had to use prednisone on regular bases. Finally got put on Nucala a few years back and it definitely helped but would wear off before the next injection. My doctor switched me to Dupixent and my asthma is way better. Been on it for 12 weeks now. I suggest to go on the 300mg. It definitely works. All the best and happy breathing!,Jeff
4,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,,"December 12, 2021",3,"I’ve been using Dupixent for over 2 years and yes it does work on my asthma, but I still cannot understand why it burns so much going in. It feels like fire is going in. But I can’t stop using it. Recently my company changed our insurance company, and there was a 4 week stoppage. After missing dupixent for just one doses, my asthma kicked in and I was in trouble for those weeks off the drugs. My Trelegy helped out a lot, but I strongly recommend using this drug for asthma, and for those who are battling with COPD. It really does work.",KDB
5,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 10, 2021",0,"I had zero smell due to nasal polyps and had 2 surgeries that temporarily relieved the pain/situation but never got my smell back.  Started Dupixent Feb 2021 and have never had any side effects and it has changed my life. I can not imagine going back to the many medications I was on before I found this solution. I was on Claritin a day, Breo, Flonase, astelin. Plus prednisone frequently when I would have allergy or give flare ups. Now I only take this one medication and do not need anything else. A blessing in my life for sure.",Nizam
6,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 5, 2021",0,"In Sep 2009 I collapsed in a parking lot and was rushed to the ER. They found that my entire left lung was full of tumors and removal of my lung was suggested. I refused and sought a proper diagnosis. Finally in Nov 2010 I was diagnosed with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. I was started on anti-fungals, high dose steroids (60 mg/ day for a year) and underwent a series of 17 bronchoscopies over about 2 years. I still had exacerbations multiple times per year often requiring hospitalization. I then was diagnosed with eosinophilic granulomatosus with polyangitis. My pulmonologist/immunologist started me on Nucala until Dupixent was FDA approved for asthma.  After my 3rd month on Dupixent I was an entirely new person.  I have completed 76 doses and have not needed another bronchoscopy. I have experienced severe eye sensitivity to light which has improved over time. The injection does burn but it pales in comparison to the lung pain I used to experience.",JoJoCal
7,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 28, 2021",2,"I just took my second self injected dose. So far, no problems. Virtually painless and no side effects. My doctor has taken me off the prednisone and so far no exacerbations. Without prednisone I was in the ER about once a month. I hope I never have to go back on prednisone. Bad side effects.",War Eagle

9,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,,"July 12, 2021",4,"Was diagnosed with AERD / Samter's Triad 10+ years ago and have had asthma, skin issues, and chronic rhinosinusitus that was near deadly several times (went into anaphylactic shock). Was on a cocktail of drugs previously including prednisone when I would get sinus infections every 3-4 months. Have been on Dupixent now for about 4 months and it is literally life altering. Have nothing but positive things to say about this drug, it has been wonderful for me.In response to another person posting above about her son using it, the actual needle isn't what causes pain of injections (unless you hit bone with needle). The liquid being injected is what hurts and that is normal. Make sure you allow the drug to warm up for 30-45 minutes before injecting as per instructions. Also, if you inject it slowly but steadily it will lessen the pain.",David V
10,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,,"June 12, 2021",16,"Worked great on my asthma but I  have lost my vision in my left eye. They can't correct it and it is at 20/600.  My vision changes started within 3-4 months of starting dupixent. and that is the only thing that has changed in my life : (  My eye doctor reports seeing this in 5 or 6 of her patients on dupixent, I just hope my vision comes back now I am stopping itWonder if anyone else has had visions changes and if it got better coming off the med?And PS it does hurt to get it!!",mitchpipe

14,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 24, 2021",4,"Started Jan 2021 for asthma.  I spent most of 2020 on antibiotics for sinus infections and prednisone for asthma.  Blood EOS was nearly non existent on blood tests, literally 0.1.  Started off fine, after 4 doses my blood pressure started going crazy, I was asleep 20 hrs a day (no exaggeration).  Two ER visits in 2 weeks and admission for BP 213/121.  No one could figure out why BP was flaring to stroke levels repeatedly.  24 hr BP cuff showed was spiking even while I was asleep.  We stopped dupixent and 2 weeks later my BP is finally settled and I can make it a whole day without napping.Really sad as it was helping, I felt less wheezy and my stuffy nose went away.Lucky to all those that it’s helping..  me, I’m back to drawing board.",Shell

The last several years with frequent fires/smoke I have had daily breathlessness and several ED visits with frequent steroid use for >1 month at a time. I noticed after a few months of being on the medication I can finally breath better. My breathlessness has gone from daily to a few times per week and resolves with rescue inhaler. This medication has greatly improved my quality of life over the past several months and I am finally able to exercise again. I am not going off this medication until I complete my maintenance allergy shots, unless I begin to experience some other side effect that’s worse than not being able to breath.",Anonymous

After being on it about 2 months no more asthma medicines no more hospitals, I feel great, I can breathe with no problems, I can smell and taste again. I get the injecgtion every other week it does hurt sometimes more than others I guess because maybe they push it in too fast. I would highly recommend this drug no side effects for me",Ton

After 40+ years on various doses of steroids, I was having monthly exacerbations that responded slowly to higher doses. Then I started Dupixent. Over the course of nine months I was able to wean off steroids completely. I sleep well, I have good exercise tolerance, and I've had only two asthma exacerbations in a year.

24,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,,,"May 9, 2020",7,Someone asked does  the  Dupixent shot hurt. I am deathly afraid of needles and it is a very tiny prick. It will hurt going on if they administer it too fast. When I told the nurse she backed off and administered it slower and then it didn't bother me. I was just ask the nurse to slow or down.

25,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 6, 2020",42,"I was diagnosed with asthma at 43 after having over a year of terrible sinus infections (sense of smell was completely gone) and being treated every other month with prednisone and antibiotics. I was put on Fasenera, but it did not do anything for me. My asthma doctor thought the sinus infection was related to my asthma so I had sinus surgery where they discovered many polyps.  After the sinus surgery I was right back to the same conditions as before.I was put on Dupixent and about two days after the first dose (600mg) my nose/sinus discharged some of the craziest stuff I had ever seen.Almost a year later and I have had no more sinus infections and I have not used an inhaler in almost all of that time.Dupixent has worked incredibly well for me.",Doc

He can’t even walk around the block with stopping for air/puffs at least 7-8 times.  He just started taking the Dupixant we are on his 2nd shot and already I notice a huge difference. I have to admit it works wonders for both aliments however the actual shot when being injected hurts something fierce. Does anyone else have this problem and is he overreacting or does it really hurt that bad? Can anything be done to lessen the pain of injection?",Kimber9mm

29,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,7.0,,"March 3, 2020",20,"I have taken Dupexient for six months now,  I have had reactions as far as it has given me psoriasis on the area that I have given myself a shot in the opposite side of the last shot,  it’s kind of strange.  The other side effect is after about the third day after the injection, I am extremely weak other than that it has really helped my wheezing more than anything,  it doesn’t really help my shortness of breath but it has helped the wheezing and coughing, so I’m very happy with it!!!!

Too many ER visits and hospital stays to count.  College was major fail as she could not manage the hiking to class in cold temps.  After a very scary night where she was life flighted to the hospital and after 5 years of steroid dependency (Nucala shots) we started Dupixent in April 2019.  Minor heart racing was the only side effect.  I have my bubbly, happy, active daughter back!  I missed her. She looks and feels fantastic.  We spend 6 hours outside last weekend sledding and hiking mountains and she hasn’t used her inhaler in months - down from 10x day on a good day.  This has literally saved her life.",PghChick

Within 24 hours after first shot my breathing suddenly became much worse and I almost went to the hospital. I was reluctant to do the second but had to see if it was the medication or a fluke. Sure enough after the second shot I developed another severe attack and my breathing worsened significantly for almost another week until the med left my system. My doctor is pulling me off due to the reaction I’m having.,Lizzy
32,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,5.0,,"January 29, 2020",33,"Went on dupixent with worsening asthma and problems from prednisone. First dose of dupixent slightly helped my breathing and the second shot saw more improvement, was getting excited that I could stop my asthma drugs eventually. Been asthmatic since childhood along with my older brother and mother. Started getting herpes outbreaks after the third shot but prior to dupixent they were well controlled. I hardly ever had breakouts but now breakouts happening regularly. Also noticed racing heart and palpitations, last shot sent my blood pressure soaring right after the shot along with elevated heart rate. I hate asthma  because it has made life harder for me and the steroids have come with many bad side effects but tonight with my heart racing again I have decided to stop dupixent.",Emmett

After that my breathing worsened to the degree of non-functioning. I was recommended by pulmonologist to use Dupixent. I can say it feels great to breath! I can walk across my home and not pray my way through the functioning that I’ll make it. I can resume normal life activity! So Grateful.This is only my first course of two shots. Do notice blurry eyes, also increased infections. Hope they will subside as time goes on. Thank you Dupixent Creators!",Kim

35,Dupixent,Asthma Maintenance,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 24, 2019",46,"I have been on prednisone every day since being diagnosed with asthma 12 years ago. I got my first injection of Dupixent in June 2019. My breathing has been incredible since then, the best in 12 years. Now the bad. 24 hours after the first injection I developed flu like symptoms and a sinus infection. It has taken 3 months of antibiotics to clear that up. With the sinus infection I now suffer from eustasion tube dysfunction. The ear and face pain is so severe that prednisone is the only pain reliever that works. The ENT believes that Dupixent is the cause of both the sinus infection and the ear problem. Surgery is the only non steroid option for the ears if I stay on Dupixent. I’m 68 years old and it feels great to have the breathing capability of a 30 year old for the first time in 12 years. I’m on more prednisone now than I was with asthma to control the ear pain so I’ve gained nothing.",Ron

I started Dupixent just about 2 months ago. It does seem to help my asthma quite a bit. However, after about 6 weeks, I started getting itchiness on my chest and now has spread to my whole upper torso. It is pretty intense itching, without any rash at least so far. I have trouble sleeping and topical steroid just seems to tick it off. I am torn between the itching and improvement in the asthma. I wonder if the itching will subside over time or if I should just cut Dupixent now.",Mikejj24

Still not able to breath, several ER visits, allergic reactions to 3 different steroids my pulmonologist finally put me on Dupixent. It has literally saved my life. I can not believe the difference in just 8 weeks. I couldn't even climb the stairs 8 weeks ago without having an asthma attack. I finally can breath and I have cleared skin too.
