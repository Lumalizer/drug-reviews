1,Breo Ellipta,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 25, 2021",1,"Shortly after taking Breo for the first time I felt light-headed, a little shaky, and tingling in my hands. This lasted about 30 minutes or so. I experienced the same effects for 4 days. On the fifth day, I took a very deep inhalation and I felt light-headed to the point of dizziness. I also felt a little jittery. This time the tingling in my hands (especially my left hand) was extremely obvious for 3 hours then gradually went away. I was advised to stop taking it. It did not help my asthma symptoms (although I was only on it for 5 days). I coughed more than usual while on it.",jlei
2,Breo Ellipta,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,,"January 8, 2021",1,"45 years with asthma. 12-21-2020 I started Breo for asthma maintenance. Dec 31st, I noticed that my asthma symptoms returned, but not as strong. Jan 2, I had no symptoms (I forgot to use it). Jan 3 – 7.Jan 7 morning I realized I was feeling bad because of the Breo. During the the past week, I'd had these symptoms, which turned out to be side effects of taking Breo:  I threw up coughing,  headache (Jan 1 - 6), light-headedness, tightness in chest, labored breathing, change in voice, I could only talk for about 10 minutes without labored breathing.  I realized it was the Breo because Jan 7, 2021, my symptom returned about 10:00 am. Other days, I'd taken my dose around 8:00 am and I'd start feeling meh around 9/9:30 am. However, Jan 7, I didn't take the Breo until a little after 9:00 am. I was feeling fine prior to that. Jan 8, 2021, I did not take Breo. I have been feeling okay today. There's a little labored breathing, but not as labored as it was in the previous days.",Phoenix
3,Breo Ellipta,Asthma Maintenance,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 31, 2020",1,"Breo Ellipta managed my asthma better than any of the other ones I have tried (Advair, Dulera) and at first I thought the side effects were much better, as it did not make my hands shake as much as the Advair or Dulera did.  Taking once at night was much better than gargling 4 times a day on the HFA with the others. HOWEVER, I noticed my heart would beat much harder or weirder on it, especially right after taking it, like it would skip a beat or flutter.  I finally started taking the EKG on my Apple Watch right after taking he break and saw that it was causing a wicked PVC/extrasytole.  My doctor took me off right away and now on Arnuity - fingers crossed.",ChrisinSF

10,Breo Ellipta,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 31, 2020",24,"I have had adult onset asthma for approx 30 years. Many hospitalizations. After having pneumonia three times early last year, my pulmonologist asked if I had been using my Breo.  No, I hadn’t because of excessive price.  After using it religiously, I did not have an attack for seven months!  After being diagnosed with an eye condition AND SEVERE PAIN in all four extremities, mainly at night, I have had to discontinue. My doctor did extensive blood work to make sure no red flags for cancer. Thank goodness no cancer.  But now what do I do.  I have other lesser side effects.  Breo was good for asthma but terrible for my health!  Will this excruciating pain eventually go away?",Rose
11,Breo Ellipta,Asthma Maintenance,9.0,,"January 21, 2020",6,"After years of trying to use non-prescription and prescription drugs to control asthma my Dr. put me on Breo Ellipta (100).  That was about 3 years ago.   For me it works well.  I rarely use my rescue inhaler.  It does tend to make my mouth slightly dryer but it does not cause any other reactions.  To avoid thrush, I take an inhalation once a night and follow up with a small amount of mouth wash, a thorough teeth brushing and water rinse.  The device has 30 inhalation’s, not quite a full month.  It is an expensive drug.  The list price is variable and seems to run $350 to $450 per each 30 shot dispenser.  With insurance, buying mail order, or from Canada you should be able to get it at about $110 to $150 per each 30 inhalation device.  There is no generic.  So far I have not had any luck with coupons.",Bud

13,Breo Ellipta,Asthma Maintenance,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 13, 2019",24,"Breo 200/25  worked great for about 6 months.  Never used my rescue inhaler.  Now I have a chronic sore throat and raspy voice, chest pain, muscle spasms in both hands, fatigue,  and insomia.  I can still breathe deeply but the side effects are getting worse the longer I continue to use Breo. I plan to return to using Symbicort, the only side effect from that was raspy voice. I was put Spiriva Respimate also last month, but the combination of Spiriva and Breo caused me to totally lose my voice. I had to quit the Spiriva, voice loss and terrible heartburn/stomach pain.",Jane
14,Breo Ellipta,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 30, 2019",48,"I have had moderate asthma since age 13, now age 41.  I have participated in multiple full marathons, cycling, swimming, rowing, yoga, walking ALL with only Singulair and a ventolin inhaler before high-intensity exercise.  I was prescribed Breo because taking ventolin before exercise multiple times a week is considered ""uncontrollable asthma.""  It has been roughly 20 days and my voice is always raspy, I have a tremor in my hands, always hungry, dry scalp, insomnia at night, pain in my chest, skipping heart beats, and weight gain.  I try going for just a brisk walk, and my lungs are immediately tight and irritated.  I then try my rescue inhaler which was my go-to and it is useless, like I never even took it.  I am discontinuing my use of this inhaler and going back to the unacceptable method where I could breathe just fine normally and used only for exercise.  It's much better than these side effects.",Karma1234
15,Breo Ellipta,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,,"September 17, 2019",34,"After not having a flair up all year and to have had my first one due to a chemical exposure I was in a full blown flair up and desperate to breathe well. Took the Breo as well as my nebulizer treatments for about 6 days 5 of which I had more severe anxiety each day that I took it very quickly after I took it so I know it was the inhaler. Before my flair up I needed nothing at all was free and clear of all meds which was amazing. I stopped the Breo due to the severity of the anxiety and decided to go to the hospital where I received prednisone and a steroid pack to ween down from. Still taking my albuterol nebulizer every day about 2-3 times until I clear up but I was not a fan of the Breo at all.Coming from someone who had severe asthma to getting myself off of all meds for over a year, to trying Breo that was terrible. The prednisone helped the first day. Hopefully I can clear up and get back to no meds through diet and exercise fingers crossed.",LadyB2387
16,Breo Ellipta,Asthma Maintenance,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 9, 2019",21,"PRO: Before I began taking this medication almost three years ago, I went through two rescue inhalers a month. Now I don't use them at all and instead of struggling to find a way to get a refill, I have so many I'm afraid they will expire before I can use them.CON: I have to clear my throat a lot and there is more drainage and sputum than before but it's a very small price to pay for being able to breathe.  Also it is NOT covered by insurance so I have to pray yearly I find the discount coupon online to cover the expense. It is about $450 without the coupon. Insurance needs to get on board.",J.F.E

19,Breo Ellipta,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 17, 2019",36,"Started using Breo after a severe asthma exacerbation. At first it controlled my asthma very well I barely had to use my rescue inhaler. But over months it stopped working & actually made it very hard for me to breath. It made me extremely irritable, mood swings, aggressive, weight gain, heart palpitations, severe anxiety attacks, spasms of my intercostal muscles, & made my chest very tight. This medicine caused me to also develop depression & a lack of motivation. 2 days off of it & I can finally take a deep breath & my brain finally has clarity. I finally feel like myself again.",C.G.H.

I had a mild wheeze and often had to clear my throat. Within a month of taking this medicine, I had full on asthma; coughing wheezing, gasping for air. I realized I often got worse after taking my dose. After spending a good part of my day in emergency, I was switched to Flovent and am finally able to fully catch a breath.

I just didn’t feel like I needed it as much. I was struggling with breathing paired with another health issue, so I went to see my pulmonologist. He put me back on BREO for a 1 month trial... and 4 days later I’d broken out in itchy hives. I assumed this was from something else, so my doctor gave me steroids to take.  I finished my steroids 3 days ago and my rash is worse than ever and still worsening. I don’t know what else it could be.... Has anybody ever had this issue?!!",Aubrey

26,Breo Ellipta,Asthma Maintenance,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 4, 2018",9,I was prescribed this to help control my Asthma Symptoms. My condition has complications so the steroid component was supposed to really help. I give this a 5/10 because it really seemed to help with the asthma: I never reached a point where I was short of breath but it almost made my lungs a little wetter. I found I was continually coughing up small amounts of phlegm with an annoying cough. Even after months of taking this medication. The only other side-effect I experienced was a bit of the jitters (like drinking too much coffee) for about 10-15 min after taking a dose. I should point out that this medication comes in a very practical package and is very easy to dose. It is however very expensive if you do not have insurance.,Chris M Calgary
27,Breo Ellipta,Asthma Maintenance,8.0,,"January 29, 2018",13,"This medicine has worked wonders for me, completely eliminating the need to take the other 3 asthma medications I take (including my fast acting inhaler). I didn’t have trouble sleeping at night due to breathing issues and I didn’t have sudden attacks at work or while doing physical activities. I cannot give this medication all stars because of the ridiculous price of the medicine. I am a single mother and cannot afford health insurance for myself and I somehow don’t qualify for any assistance. I am shocked that this one life changing medication is almost half of what my monthly rent is. Simply put I cannot afford this medicine and therefore continue to take breathing treatments 3 times a day and burn through my albuterol inhalers at work and exercising. I find it absurd that you can get prescriptions that people abuse and/or sale illegally for nothing and I can’t afford and inhaler so I can live a normal life. I will also note I don’t smoke and I eat healthy and exercise.",BaliseB
28,Breo Ellipta,Asthma Maintenance,7.0,,"January 24, 2018",6,"Updating after one year. Its still cut my rescue inhaler usage by less than half. One month supply of the rescue will last three. HOWEVER your immune system will be completely shot. It is worth it if you have asthma like mine. I suggest keeping up with your allergy medicine to keep sinus infections away and I'm looking into an immunity booster. Vitamin C doesn't cut it.  My only other complaint is it will mess with your vocal chords.  The best part about this is when I did get sick with bronchitis, I could still breathe even with all the coughing and wheezing. It will definitely keep those airways open.",Elnemer

It worked great in giving me the ability to breath comfortably. Two months later I had bronchitis that turned into pneumonia and a mild heart attack. After test doctors decided the heart attack was a fluke brought on by being so sick that it put a strain on my heart. While in the hospital they had me on two inhalers, nebulizer every 4 hrs and oxygen 24/7. Which I had to use when I was released. After a week home I went back on the Breo. Within a week I was off the oxygen and able to stop using the rescue inhaler and nebulizer. Four months later I moved and went to a new doctor. He diagnosed me with severe asthma.

I can exercise withought using it, I can sleep at night and I have gone days with completely forgetting I had a rescue inhaler.  It has been a miracle drug.  It is expensive though but my doctor gave me a discount card and it's free now.  My only issue is when its very cold and you work your bronchi hard outside, it hurts but it's worth it.
