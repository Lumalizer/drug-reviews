So, then Flovent, (hated the side effects); so was approved finally for Advair 250/50 twice a day.RE: Thrush I am always rinsing/swishing thoroughly after each use with water, and gargling! 4-5x really not a big deal.Also, use a pH balanced mouthwash called: **Smart Mouth Clinical DDS ** NEVER had thrush issues!If/when I have had any vocal rasp, it it temporary, and goes away within a short time.Hope this helps someone!

1,Advair Diskus,Asthma Maintenance,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 16, 2021",13,"It definitely helped me to breathe better, but puts me at risk for thrush. Once in a while I get thrush in the throat, which is annoying and I have to stop using Advair for a few days, and I struggle to breathe again about two days later. Clears up pretty quick. It’s a good idea to eat yogurt after rinsing your mouth, so now I eat yogurt all the time.",Alex
2,Advair Diskus,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,,"February 22, 2021",3,"I left the office with my mom and tried it and immediately felt like I had ingested the smoke of 20 cigarettes (I'm super-square, I've had one inhalation of a cigarette in my life), making my chest feel constricted. She said to try it for a few days; I did and felt progressively worse. She also has mild asthma, so she tried it and also felt awful. We went back to the doctor pronto. He told us we were wrong, that Advair was in fact helping me and that I should keep using it. ""Can I just have another prescription for my  Proventil inhaler?"" ""As your doctor, I really think Advair is better for you"". I trashed the Advair inhaler/Disk and found another doctor who happily gave me my appropriate prescription for Proventil. I'm so glad I didn't have real health repercussions. Gross. Again, every other encounter I've had with a medical professional has been entirely on the up & up, brimming with care and knowledge.",s.gordon

4,Advair Diskus,Asthma Maintenance,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 14, 2020",9,I’ve been using advair for 5 years works great for asthma first time asthma felt controlled but side effects of a tight throat and change in voice is concerning. Now I had to stop this medicine as throat issues have become worse the occasional sore throat is now at least once a week and my throat feels like it’s working so hard like the muscles in the neck are actually sore from the tightness. Not really sure what is happening and not sure what to do with an asthma prevention alternative now.  Also had a major asthma attack and took about a month to recover so if your throat starts feeling funny and you voice box and larynx feels sore beware and talk to your doctor it just came on so fast,Life time asthma person

It’s very frustrating. I also have coronary artery spasms which are due entirely to the severe asthma.

I never realized how effective this was until I stopped my asthma meds altogether (this inhaler & another smaller one). I needed to see the doctor that I avoided for about 3 months but I had an actual asthma attack. It was scary as heck. When I finally went in my Dr. explained the importance of my inhaler because the steroid is that powerful. I went back on it & immediately recognized a huge difference. It’s helped me for a decade. No doubt. It is pricey though.,Mountain girl

I asked my physician to switch me to something else and she put me on this.  A marked difference.  This has a steroid as well as a stimulant (to open your lungs upon inhalation, much like a rescue inhaler, which Pulmicort did not have).  I forgot to refill my Advair this month (I mail order three months at a time with my insurance, WAY cheaper) and have been without for about 4 days.  I can definitely tell the difference.

Because of the high price, I end up extending to 60 days, sometimes over that. I use it once a day rather than twice - it works wonderfully as a preventative dose. My PCP is comfortable with this lowered dose, so the only risk I run is with the side effects and the delayed use of the disk. FortunatelyI don't feel much side effects.

56,Advair Diskus,Asthma Maintenance,,,"March 3, 2010",40,"I have been using Advair for about 5 years. When I first noticed my wheezing and coughing, I thought I had a cold, But the doctor said it is bronchial asthma. He started with Prednisone and Advair. I soon felt better I stopped the Prednisone and I am on Advair 250/50 since.Recently I was advised to see a Chiropractor he promised to help take me off all medications and I will be okay. What a mistake? In order for him to do this I had to stop my Advair, because he said he can't fight with it, I must first stop taking it. The end result was that I spent about $400.00 for twice a  week visits. I saw no results on the contrary my wheezing came back full force with the tightness of my chest I had to start all over again with the medications.",Ell Emm

58,Advair Diskus,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,,"November 18, 2009",62,My daughter went on Advair when she was 10 to control exercise and seasonal allergy induced asthma.  She developed severe stomach aches (daily) and became lactose intolerant after several months.  After allergy season she was taken off the Advair.  She went to a gastroenterologist for almost a year to clear up the stomach aches.  She did not use Advair during that time.  When the stomach problem was cleared up the lactose intolerance disappeared as well.  The next allergy season she was put on Advair and almost immediately developed stomach aches and lactose intolerance.  She stopped using the Advair and the stomach issues and lactose intolerance disappeared. The doctors find no correlation......?,lactose intolerance from advair
