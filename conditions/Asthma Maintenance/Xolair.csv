1,Xolair,Asthma Maintenance,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 6, 2021",0,"I had severe asthma starting in my late 60s and was diagnosed with several allergies. The usual course of trial and error steroid and inhalers proved largely ineffective and I ended up in the Emerg twice. A new doctor recommended Xolair and after the second set of injections my asthma was totally in control while I continued daily use of Zenhale and Spiriva and occasionally Salbutamol. As I told my doctor, you have given me my life back again. I still have asthma and must be prudent about my surroundings but with Xolair I have a largely normal life. I have no obvious side-effects from Xolair other than the inconvenience of the bi-weekly injection schedule.",Torontonian
2,Xolair,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,,"October 23, 2021",0,I was on it from late 2005 till about 2012. Shortly after I started taking the medication I developed heart PVC’s.  I believe it was caused as a direct result from the xolair. I went to a cardiologist and got a full work up. The PVC’s are annoying and can be unsettling but they are not life threatening (not as of yet anyways). I still have the PVC’s from time to time but not as often as I did as when I was on the xolair. My asthma has been very well controlled since I got off the xolair and started taking Symbicort. Just my experience.,Jkaff

I had perfect eyes before no problems with my eyes until I started taking xolair monthly for my asthma. Then every month I noticed it was harder for me to see. So I went to the eye dr and lost 60% in my right and 40% in the left !!! I immediately stopped taking it and told my dr I didn’t want to take it !! If I could give my review a zero I would !!

4,Xolair,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 3, 2021",3,"31 year old female, no known allergies. Woke up one day with full body hives that did not react well to steroids/antihistamines until I upped my dose to four Zyrtec per day. Started on 300 mg of Xolair 5 weeks ago and am hive free. No Zyrtec needed. I noticed a headache the first time around and did feel like it made me overly alert, but honestly I'm super happy to not have to take so much Zyrtec. I just got my second dose and am still happy. Will check back in in 4-6 months. Had to fight with insurance to get approved but it was worth it",Angelina

My bones and muscles feel like they are constantly under some form of warfare. Aches, pains, and spasms all over my entire body. I can breath, but I constantly feel like I was hit with a car and just keep living after each hit.

8,Xolair,Asthma Maintenance,8.0,,"May 19, 2020",8,"Severe asthma, was previously on Nucala. It didn't help that much. Regular bouts of bronchitis, and other chest infections. Ok, 8 days ago I received 300 mg of Xolair. Shortly after the injections, I could feel my chest starting to loosen up. The next 7 days I could breathe pretty easily, only using my nebulizer every other day. Now for the side effects I have experienced this so far.... (Drum roll) nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, leg cramps, sore muscles, and extreme fatigue. The fatigue is fading, but everything else is still here. I added Alka Seltzer chewables, to my daily regime and I do not eat that much now (not a bad thing for me). I'm 39 yrs old. I'm trying to get my quality of life back. While I can breathe now, and breathe well, now I must figure out a plan to deal with the side effects.Does it work for my asthma, Yes! Do the side effects negate the ease of being able to breathe?

Xolair did solve my asthma issues.   It also, helped heal my lungs and stop me from getting constant infections.  But the side effects of Xolair are real.  I did not have any  anaphylactic reactions.  I did have body aches that felt like my bones were breaking, headaches, restless leg syndrome, bloating, hair loss, dizziness, tremors and night terrors.

I had now developed asthma on top of the COPD. My lung doctor decided on the Xolair for the immunotherapy. I had 1 injection - for 3 months total. It worked miracles for my breathing!! My side effects were headaches and fatigue for the 1st week after the shot. After the 2nd month, I developed bone and joint aches & pain in my legs and planters fasciitis! My toes and fingers feel swollen (but they're not) when I bend them. I would feel like I'm 100 years old. I was so stiff. I've been taking Motrin on a daily basis for the past 2 months for the pain and stiffness.SOME of the aches, pains and stiffness have decreased -  because of the prednisone I'm taking.  After I'm off this round of prednisone, we're giving the side effects a few more weeks before contacting the pharmaceutical company for some answers.

I have had asthma (relatively well managed) for more than 40 years. Last year I was  hospitalized twice. I was eventually referred to both an Allergist and Respirologist. I had been on 3 back to back courses of prednisone. Allergy tests revealed severe environmental allergies as well as oral allergy syndrome. I was approved for fortnightly  injections that began in June of this year. I noticed a benefit immediately but after the 4th shot the benefits were wearing off at approximately day 9. I had injections in Aug 13, had 2 full blown asthma attacks in Aug 16 and 17 and continue to labour for breath. I had a scheduled appoint with Respirologist on the 20th. Gave him an update and expressed my frustration. The ragweed pollen is particularly high this year. He prescribed another round of prednisone.

Prior to starting injections, I was in the hospital 6-8 times a year for pneumonia, low O2 levels, pleurisy you know - the usual asthma nonsense. I had been taking prednisone (the only thing that semi-worked) and was at the point of 120mg of that to breathe and be able to function. I ended up with Cushings Disease from the steroids. This was the most miserable time of my life. Xolair took about 8 months of injections to work. I continue to go monthly for 2 injections and I can honestly say that this has been life-saving.

I will say my breathing is somewhat better I'm not using my rescue inhaler as often as I have been. I'm able to do things that I hadn't been able to do for a long time due to my asthma. I have noticed I am experiencing more headaches than normal my vision is blurry. My blood pressure has gone up and my legs ache and cramp. I have mentioned this to my nurse practitioner. I was told let's keep an eye on it that's kind of odd so now I'm at the point where I don't even want to take the shot anymore due to all the side effects.,Bianca

When I complained to my doctor they denied that it was the xolair, but it is a known side affect.  Then I began have extreme joint discomfort and it got worse after each shot.  finally I had a positive  antinuclear antibodies (ANA) test, and I have never had anything like that!!  I have been off the xolair for 2 months with out much relief of my joints, although my hair loss has slowed down.  I was told it will take time for it to all get out of my system. I don't want to say it's a terrible drug because not everyone has these side effects.  But I hope that anyone who is wondering if the cause of their issues could be xolair, it probably is!",lizzy
22,Xolair,Asthma Maintenance,9.0,,"June 12, 2018",16,"Highly recommend Xolair.  Was in the clinical trials for Xolair well over 10 years ago.  Before Xolair, I was a severe asthmatic who could be found in the hospital almost monthly due to allergic asthma.  I received 2 injections every 2 weeks . . . until I became allergic to it.  The company requested - and received - my DNA in order to help them understand why I became allergic, and to help others in the future.Xolair was a miracle drug for me - and still is.  We don't know why but it seems to have had a residual effect of some sort with me.  A year after stopping the injections I was stung 2-3 times by yellow jackets.  I would have immediately gone into anaphylaxis without the residual effect of the Xolair.  Instead, I drove myself to the ER (Epi-Pen ready to use) without any problems.  There was a ""typical"" reaction of swelling and pain around the site of the stings with no other reactions.",HonestC

I was at the point that I stopped going out with my friends or doing anything at all, because my asthma drained me and I was always scared of going into an asthma attack.

I struggled with chronic asthma and allergies my whole childhood and teen years. My allergist prescribed this shot to me, so I could eventually be healthy enough to receive allergy shots. I started Xolair at age 13 and received my last dose of it when I was 16. Xolair was worth the pain, time and money. The serum is extremely thick and I received 3 shots of it every 2 weeks, but nothing compares to the quality of life I have now.

One day after a shot, I experienced what can only be described as the most ridiculous sounding symptom on the Xolair box, feelings of impending doom.

The only reason I didn't take it the whole time was because I was pregnant twice and insurance issues the other time. When I'm not on this medication I can't even so much as look at a cat or dog. I have not had to take oral steroids monthly like I used too, only now maybe once a year with I get a cold or flu. I was so restricted in what I could do before I took xolair, now I can go to the gym or play with the kids just fine.

While I still take regular maintenance medicines in addition to a steroid inhaler, Xolair had allowed me to give up my nebulizer and has turned of the allergic rhinitis faucet in my head.  At the time of my last injection I was wheezing slightly (residual symptoms from a three week battle with bronchitis).  Within 15 minutes of the injection the wheezing had stopped and I was breathing easier. I've taken Xolair since 2005 without any adverse reaction.

I was very symptomatic the morning of the shot - phlegm, restricted breathing, swelling of appendages, face, neck & throat, redness, burning (had idiopathic anaphylaxis/asthma). Twenty minutes after the shot I suddenly felt an unusual open feeling in my sinuses, and my phlegm was gone. I could take an unrestricted breath for the first time in years. I noticed my sore throat, the burning, much of my swelling, and redness was gone. My eyes were wide and white and I guess weren't swollen because I could focus. I left feeling elated. But driving I began to feel fatigued coupled with bursts of energy, some dizziness and strange mental activity. I didn't feel safe driving and canceled work. ",HeidiFaye

After years of the typical allergy shots at the Drs. office, and having reactions from them, face swelling, throat shutting off, using the Epipen, it was a weekly thing.  Going to the grocery store and praying that the person in line did not have a cat at home, yikes!  Well, Xolair is AMAZING!

Nothing my allergist was able to do would turn things around for me.  He suggested we try this pretty new medicine.  My improvement did not occur immediately, but every month as we measured my lung function it improved by 2 to 5 percent.   By the end of that summer I was feeling much, much better and by the end of a years I was up to 77% of normal.

The severity of my asthma was so bad, that it would land me in the hospital at least once every two months. And I mean admitted for like a week, not just ER visits.  I take 300mg 4 times a month. The results are phenomenal. I am able to do things and participate in physical activities that i havent been able to do in years. I have zero side effects, and although it is a pain to have to go the infusion center at the hospital once a week, it is beyond worth it.

For years I would do the emergency room thing, be admitted to the local hospital into ICU for a week or so at a time, several times each year.

After that I felt energetic and a lessening in all over body pain. That night I slept through without any asthma attack, it appears to also be suppressing my Lupus.
