0,Ventolin HFA,Asthma Maintenance,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 15, 2021",2,"In my 40 years of asthma experience, Ventolin has the WORST nervous system side effects of any abuterol inhaler I have ever used. (Generic, proventil, proair hfa)I suggest you NOT use if, like me, have sensitivity to stimulants (caffeine,etc), anxiety, adrenal, heart, or panic attack issues, or like me it will likely aggravate all of them, even with one dose as it does for me.With regular use, as my MD directed (because I forgot past experience), my nervous system became so agitated that not only could not sit still, my whole body felt like it was vibrating, and triggered a physiological (not cognitive/emotional) panic attack where I struggled to breath and my heart rate stayed high and exceeded 175bpm and stuttered with slightest physical activity, well above the recommended max of 157 for age 63. Having heart issues as a result.",Andy
1,Ventolin HFA,Asthma Maintenance,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 16, 2020",3,"Ventolin has always worked like a charm for my issue. Helps my breathing improve fairly quickly, I highly recommend it. Sometimes you can get dizzy but it does not last very long.",BeeRealz
2,Ventolin HFA,Asthma Maintenance,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 25, 2020",3,"My Ventolin inhaler has always given me relief when I have an asthma attack or am short of breath. I find that after so many uses, it will clog. After removing the canister, rinsing the actuator with warm water and letting it dry, should unclog it.",Arthur
3,Ventolin HFA,Asthma Maintenance,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 2, 2019",12,"Ventolin seems to work the best for me.  I used to use Proventil and that worked for a little bit, but then seemed to stop working.  Ventolin consistently works well for me and I've been using it since around 2009.  Unfortunately, my insurance company does not cover Ventolin at all. I have to pay full price for it which cost me $66 today.  They want me to get ProAir and I don't even want to try it as I've read nothing but bad things about it, from the dispenser not working, to it running out after a few sprays, to the power clumping up inside the cannister rendering it completely useless even with a working dispenser.  No thanks!  I'd rather use what has been working for me.  Why change something if it's working? I don't understand why my insurance company won't cover it anymore.",Me
4,Ventolin HFA,Asthma Maintenance,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 25, 2018",9,This is the only rescue inhale that works for me.  I use a cortical steroid inhaler for maintenance and this is my rescue inhaler for those rare instances I need something.  For some reason my insurance company has stopped covering this inhaler and they keep forcing a substitution with ProAir HFA which is worse than useless.  Ventolin HFA needs to be doing a better job marketing their product to the insurance companies so their users are having to constantly scramble for coupons to pay for it.,Anonymous
5,Ventolin HFA,Asthma Maintenance,4,,"February 27, 2017",9,"Right now, I am waiting for my doctor to renew my prescription so I can get my medication.  The inhaler I am currently using shows it has 122 puffs left, and its empty.  This isn't the first time I've had one of these go dry before its used up.  Now, without an inhaler, I have to hope that the doctor on Monday will send in the renewal.  Fortunately, unless the pharmacy will provide a new inhaler to compensate for the defective one, I am out the money that was paid for it.  Oh, it does work, when it has medication in it.",Richland Washington Davis.
