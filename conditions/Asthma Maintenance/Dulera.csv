0,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 28, 2021",6,"My child was put on Dulera, his asthma has been a struggle to control for years. After 2 weeks, he gained 8 pounds and his chest is so congested, I had him checked for pneumonia. His asthma has been worse than ever. He has wheezing worse than ever before. It sounds like an accordion when he breathes. We had him switched to a higher dose of his last medication and he has been using nebulizer treatments to undo whatever the Dulera did. I'm not sure how long it will take for him to bounce back from the weight gain.",Anonymous
1,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 5, 2021",0,"I have struggled to with my asthma for 28 years now. I tried many drugs, and combination of drugs, to get it under control but would still always need an inhaler or Nebulizer treatment. Then my asthma specialist tried dulera in combination with singulair (was already taking it). And for the FIRST time in any memory I have I could breathe easy no tightness no little obstruction or wheeze here and there. I could run, I could practically fly up and stairs. Finally my body could keep up with me.As far as side effects I didn't really experience any in my time of using it.",John
2,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 28, 2020",2,"Horrible Med, all it has done was caused me to pack on weight, cause high blood pressure and more asthma issues than I ever had before I was put on it, I am seriously going to talk to my doctor about it( I have been on it for 5-6 yrs to see if I can get on something else so I can go back to exercising to lose the weight it packed on.  If doctor won't I guess its time for a new doctor and gradually ween myself off of Dulera period",D6968
3,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 18, 2020",4,"I was forced to use Dulera after getting a new Job and Advair went from $0 to $160 a month. I have been on Dulera for about a month total, what I can tell you is I hate the side effects of it. I have spasms in my pecs and calves which always seem to be noticed about 30 minutes to an hour after I use the inhaler. Shaking in my hands and the occasional blurred vision. I wish I could go back to Advair but insurance won’t budge and I can’t afford it. I find it easier to use my rescue inhalers then keep taking Dulera.",KBen
4,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 22, 2019",3,"Dulera Helped my asthma disappear- it was amazing! Now the effects: I feel like I can barley think, my vision is blurry, I gained about 7 pounds, always hungry, moody and excessively tired. I’d rather not breathe!",Wheezy4life
5,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 27, 2019",10,"I've been using this for approx. 6 months and my asthma has never been better. However, it causes me terrible muscle spasms all over my body and I've gained over 10 pounds. I've tried lowering the dose and taking extra potassium and magnesium to see if it lessens the spasms, to no avail. I'm going to have to stop taking it.",Chels
6,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 8, 2017",10,"Used Dulera for 6 months.  It worked fantastically for my asthma.  I used a spacer with it.  Dulera leaves or causes ""boogies"" in your nose that filter the air for you.  BUT, it gave me severe migraines.  I wouldn't have found out if the following hadn't happened.  Was due for a refill, my insurance wanted the Dr. to do another ""dance"" to prove I need this, and because of the delay, I started wanting to know just how much does this med cost.  Was shocked at the price.  But during my shock, my eyes fell upon 3 main side effects (I make it a practice not to look at side effects unless I experience something) and headaches was one of them.  Shazam!!  So THAT was why I'd been having debilitating migraines all summer.",jaboshaoo
7,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,7.0,,"September 25, 2017",13,"Dulera is working great on my breathing and helping me cough up excess mucus but my pain level in the parts of my body that have osteoarthritis seems to have increased. I know my blood pressure is up so my doctor did add another blood pressure that's helping take care of that. I just am in pain wherever I have osteoarthritis, has anyone else experienced this?",Naa1958
8,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,,"August 24, 2017",7,"I have probably spent 2,000$ this year due to hospital co pays, I was put on dulera and it has completely stopped my wheezing, I just wish I didn't need medicine to breathe :(",Marjanexz
9,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,,,"May 18, 2017",16,"After 8 months of taking Dulera it suddenly hit me that I was very sensitive to dust, harsh cleaning products, 2nd hand smoke and strong perfumes. After much thought I talked to my doctor about this suspicion that Dulera was causing this. She said go ahead and stop using it.Dulera did *work* for preventing daily asthma, however, I think it also prevents the lungs (and yourself) from actually dealing with asthma attacks when they do come. I'm nearing my 2nd week off Dulera and I'm finding out that I need to re-learn how to effectively calm myself down when some mild asthma is coming.Dulera worked pretty well for me for several months until I was confronted head-on with new triggers that previously did not effect me before Dulera.",Anonymous
10,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,,"April 12, 2017",9,a very good product. it works..shame that the company has jacked the price up so much that its no longer affordable...greed is a very bad thing,sherman sparks
11,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,9.0,,"May 24, 2016",9,"I've had asthma ever since I quit smoking.  I've quit twice and each time after 3 years, the asthma kicks in - bad!  I've tried everything and am now on Dulera, which helped tremendously.  My insurance wouldn't cover it; $375 for one inhaler.  Found PAN online and they are taking care of the cost.  If not for PAN, I would not be able to take Dulera.  However, after several months on this med, my teeth starting rotting - very quickly.  My dentist said he only sees this kind of deterioration in chemo patients and someone who hasn't brushed in 20 years.  I've had two teeth pulled already, and another is scheduled to be pulled.  Also, started with thrush a day ago and today I can barely move my tongue.  (Yes, I've been rinsing.)",Spfld MA
12,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 1, 2016",17,"The weight gain was not worth it.  I quit.  My asthma is moderate, not at all severe and my doc put me on Dulera, SIngulair after 5 days of steroids.  Then added Spiriva and now Breo.  Ridiculous.  I quit them all except Breo, which I don't even take every day (because my breathing is not obstructed or difficult)!  But during Dulera and Singluar, I gained FIFTEEN POUNDS in 2 months, which I have never done in my entire life (I'm in my late 40s).",ABlue
13,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 1, 2016",5,so far its helping out pretty well,puppup
14,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,,"December 7, 2015",21,"I acquired adult asthma at age 41.  I was using a rescue inhaler at least 1-2 times per day and was having a hard time sleeping due to increased nasal discharge and asthma symptoms.  Literally choking at night.  Dr put me on the Dulera recommended dose of 200 mg 2 puffs, 2 times per day.  I was out of my mind hyper although I could instantly breath better.  I dropped the dose down to 1 puff early in the day and the Dr. said that it was fine as long as I felt it was helping.  It's been 3 months, I feel amazing. I no longer wake at night.  My sinuses are no longer dripping.  I breath easier and I've lost 15lbs because my activity level has increased now that I can breath.  I have not needed a rescue inhaler once.  Amazing for my needs.",Sharine
15,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,8.0,,"March 12, 2014",45,I have been an asthmatic for most of my life (I am now 38 yrs old) and have tried many medications.  Before I lost my insurance I was on singulair and claritin and still struggling.  Several times I woke up gasping for air.  So when I was able to get insurance again I requested to try something else since I was hesitant to say the least in taking singulair again.  My Dr. suggested I try Dulera and Flonase.  Since starting these medications I have not needed my albuterol inhaler once and its been about a month.  I went from using my inhaler sometimes several times a day to not at all.  My mom has osteoporosis (excuse the spelling) and that concerns me for my own health but my breathing is ultimately more important.,Buphie
16,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,,"November 3, 2013",42,"My 17 year old asthmatic son previously was on advair hfa inhaler and using his albuterol inhaler 3x week.  He had a blood test come back indicating he was uncontrolled. He just took his second dose of 2 puffs of the sample Dulera the immunologist gave him and walked out the door mentioning a bad taste in his mouth. Half way down the street from our home (while he was driving) he suddenly could not breathe!!! Thank God he is ok but, is badly shaken. Writing this review to advise everyone be at home with a family member/friend when you begin taking Dulera...we could have had a real tragedy a d I don't want this to happen to anyone else. Needless to say we will be discontinuing and calling doctor first thing Monday morning.",RNMemphisMom
17,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2013",37,"I am my second day and just took my evening dose, I seriously thought I was dying. The second the medicine hit my lungs I could not breath. It took all I could do to find my rescue inhaler. This was just now the most frightening experience I have ever had with an RX.... I am still shaking as I type this. Beware, I read this as a side affect.... (Rare)....just make sure you have your rescue inhaler close to you. Done with this RX!",Chris- DFW
18,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,5.0,,"July 13, 2013",31,"Have been on this for 6 weeks, and have to discontinue due to severe insomnia, heart pounding and chest pain. Very effectively reduced my need for albuterol (went from using it daily down to once or twice a week) but the side effects are bad.",SKV
19,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,,"June 18, 2013",38,"I've been asthmatic for the past 5 years. During the last 6 months or so my asthma has really gotten out of control, to the point where I was borderline abusing my rescue, inhaler, a average of 6 times per day. I recently started working out again and within 20 minutes of light to moderate power walking on the treadmill I would have to rush back to the car overwhelmed with wheezing, a tight sensation in my chest, my head pounding, struggling to take a breath, gasping for air. I finally had enough and decided to be proactive and see a allergist! He checked my vital signs and realized that a had lingering wheeze and gave me a sample of Dulera, two puffs daily. This is a miracle! ",ikrystaleforever
20,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,2.0,,"April 29, 2013",31,I was just prescribed Dulera today and noticed that my lungs felt slightly better immediately however it has been only 2 hours since I used the inhaler and my hands are shaking like I have low blood sugar. ,Angela Smith
21,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,5.0,,"January 26, 2012",27,"Doctor had me try this instead of just increasing the dosage of Asmanex I was taking.  Dulera is a combination of Asmanex with something else, and that added component did NOT do well with me.  ",Anonymous
22,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,8.0,,"January 19, 2012",55,"I've had respiratory problems since birth (I am now 25 years old) and have always used Albuterol to control any flare-ups I've had. As I've gotten older, my allergies have gotten worse and so has my asthma. I was using Asmanex until I caught RSV and bronchitis. Even with Albuterol and Asmanex, my lung function dropped to 70%, and I ended up at the ER 3 times. Dulera has made the world of a difference - I'm no longer short of breath, coughing non-stop, or feel like I've got pressure on my chest. I feel like my quality of life is back to ""normal"". The only drawback is the cost-- my insurance won't cover it.",Anonymous
23,Dulera,Asthma Maintenance,8.0,,"September 30, 2011",49,"After 6 weeks of taking Dulera, I find the relief effect wears down towards the 10th and eleventh hour.  My dosage is 2 puffs morning, 1 puff evening.  I'm 78 years old, and an asthmatic for 76 of those years.Compared to Symbicort, Dulera ""wears off"" (as above) slightly faster.   Each is a good maintenance medication.",Dick 7
