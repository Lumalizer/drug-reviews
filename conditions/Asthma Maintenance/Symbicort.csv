0,Symbicort,Asthma Maintenance,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 25, 2022",0,I am 72 years of age and my asthma has gotten much worse in the last few years. Without the Symbicort 160/4.5 I would be in and out of the hospital constantly  I  believe! Two puffs twice a day  controls it quite well. It keeps my breathing fairly decent and lessens the chest pain and coughing. When inhaling it I hold it in as long as I can. It has greatly improved my quality of life!,Hans
1,Symbicort,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 24, 2022",0,"Best inhaler I’ve used. My asthma was gone after a year on QVar 7 years ago and came back hard, 18 months ago with covid. Used my albuterol inhaler 2-4 times a day and was like breathing through a straw on hikes. I’ve been on symbicort a week. Have not used my albuterol inhaler once in that time. 11 mile hike was a breeze. Plenty of clear phlegm that I have to spit out, but I’m finally getting my lungs cleared out. I was jittery the first 24 hours and that subsided. Slightly horse voice here and there also. But I can fully breathe again!!!!",Anthony
2,Symbicort,Asthma Maintenance,8.0,,"February 24, 2022",0,"I’ve been on symbicort for a little over a year for asthma. It has helped me tremendously, but have had  side effects . Muscle spasms and some sinus issues. I’ve also noticed that it doesn’t work as well when it gets down to the last 15-20 inhalations. Asthma symptoms return at the end of the life of the symbicort inhaler. Changing my diet and drinking a ton of water has helped with muscle spasms.",Mary
3,Symbicort,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2022",0,"I have been using this for a couple of weeks and decided today that I cannot take it any more - it has caused headaches, bloating, and, worst of all, severe depression. I am a long-term depressive anyway and I take anti-depressants, but this med has sent me back into a state where I cry uncontrollably for no clear reason and cannot concentrate on my work. I was taking two puffs of 400mg per day. This morning I did not take it and during the day I had to use my Ventolin four times. This is not great but I'm just not prepared to poison myself with Symbicort any more. E mailed the manufacturer - nothing back. E mailed the doctor - still waiting for an answer. Very upset by this whole thing. Going back to Innovair. It's not that effective for me but I can't be doing with this.",StripeyCat
4,Symbicort,Asthma Maintenance,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 12, 2022",1,"Thank you all for your reviews! I’m 62 and have had asthma most of my life, as I age, it’s getting worse. It’s been about three or four weeks of me being on Symbicort 160 and I have been miserable ever since! I had no idea until seeing your post that Symbicort is the culprit of all of my angst! I have excruciating muscle spasms, constant running nose, annoying/constant clearing of my throat, horrible dry mouth/bad breath - I could go on and on! Over the last week I have eliminated several other non-important medication’s from my daily routine trying to single out which is causing me all these problems, I am now down to two Symbicort being one of them and since this is the newest of the two I will not be taking this medication ever again effective immediately! Again thank you all for your honesty and for helping me make this decision. I may go back to Advair and see if that will help with my asthma maintenance.",Kim
5,Symbicort,Asthma Maintenance,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 27, 2022",1,"After developing breathing problems about five or six years ago (wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness), I was diagnosed as having asthma last year and was prescribed Symbicort.  Since my first dosage of it, I have not had to use a rescue inhaler and I feel completely ""normal"" again.  Before going on Symbicort, I never went anywhere without having my rescue inhaler nearby.  Even during the night I would have to take it.  My doctor told me to take two puffs twice a day of Symbicort, but because I'm afraid of getting some of the many symptoms that many have mentioned and that are listed on the packaging, I often take just one dose twice a day unless I start to feel any congestion etc. and then I go back to using it twice a day for a week or so.  I wasn't sure if I should be reducing the dosage, but so far I am thrilled with Symbicort.  It has totally transformed my life.  As yet, I thankfully have not experienced any negative reactions from it.",Thankful

7,Symbicort,Asthma Maintenance,5.0,,"November 18, 2021",1,"I was prescribed symbicort 160 for mild asthma 2 years ago. The first time I took it (2 doses), my heart started beating so fast and I started shaking, a LOT. It was awful. The doctor told me to reduce to dose to one puff, but it still made me jittery and shaky. I tried to live with it for a while because it made my asthma a lot better, and the coughing stopped completely, but eventually got sick of it and stopped. I tried to take it again recently because my asthma is acting up again, but the feeling is just awful. I also have a dry mouth, and I feel anxious and irritable.",Babs

This drug is by far the worst experience I’ve had! It made my asthma 10X worse, my hands and feet swelled, it made me feel really tired and aches all over my body, my skin began to peel off and even my toenails started to randomly fall off! had all the tests needed to confirm it wasn’t anything else. My doctor has now took me off this drug and put me back on seretide. I feel so much better and can actually breathe! I personally didn’t have a great experience but we all react differently.",Jessy

The second time I literally coughed and hacked for 4 1/2 hours straight while at work! Needless to say, I threw it away. Thank goodness I didn't pay anything for it.

10,Symbicort,Asthma Maintenance,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 1, 2021",0,"For years it was necessary to carry an asthma inhaler for shortness of breath. The condition is symptomatic of a weakened immune system and my interest was always piqued by other people coughing. Usually I'd mention air conditioning and ""a steroid for the lungs"". One morning when feeling down I gave a cough and thought of all that advice I'd given so I picked up the Symbicort tucked away and took the dose. My feeling 'down' lifted in minutes. I was suffering from feelings of inferiority and fear that had caused depression. Now known to me, Symbicort is essential for my mental health.",John Wheeler
11,Symbicort,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 23, 2021",3,"This stuff is terrible. I was naive to think that my Dr cared enough that they wouldn't prescribe a med or not even question said med when I've clearly had a ton of side effects for the last 10 years. Even my pharmacist argued with me when I told him that depression was a side effect. Like what. Of course it may not have been symbicort but I can't believe it took all this time for me to realize that my health concerns were due to that. I guess I thought drs would warn you about side effects but clearly not. So this is my list: went to the ER three times and twice I needed an emergency endoscopy to remove food caught in my throat. The specialist diagnosed me with GERD. I had absolutely no throat issues before starting this med. I had to go to emerg because on another occasion my face blue up twice it's size, I'm having liver issues",edyn13

Now I have been sick for 3 weeks, all tests from hospital came back fine for everything so I've come to the conclusion it's my medication, especially as the sickness is worse a while after using my inhaler. I feel like I can't breathe, I am coughing more, I have red cheeks, black under eyes, shaking, tachycardia, thick phlegm, adrenaline surges, bad rhinitis, joint and muscle aches, very hard to sleep, weakness, bruising, tiredness to the point I'm nearly falling asleep multiple times a day.

Suddenly I had such severe reflux I could not eat, and diet adjustments did not help. I had terrible palpitations, hundreds a day. For weeks I suffered and my gastro had no idea what was happening.

It does help to keep my asthma under control (I still have to use my inhaler and nebulizer when using symbicort, but I suppose everyone's situation is different) but I have had many side effects. It makes my throat hurt terribly, it is difficult to speak and I cannot sing (I'm a musician) when I take it even half as much as I am prescribed to. It also has greatly affected my mood and mental state. I am prone to depression and this has made my bouts of depression amplified and last longer than I have ever experienced. I also read that osteoporosis is a side effect so I have stopped taking it. I am using my nebulizer a lot until I find another way to keep my breathing under control. It is also REALLY expensive.

Went back to using rescue inhaler only until my doc. prescribed me Symbicort almost two years ago for poorly controlled asthma and it works great! The side effects that I notice are heart palpitations but not as severe as with Advair, aching joints, eye problems like blurriness and recently had a bad eye infection but not sure of the cause?  I feel very torn about stopping though because I hardly ever reach for my rescue puffer now and feel like I’m more active! Been having bad hip pain and Im wondering if it’s not causing that too?

Only side effects I notice is I have to clear my throat a lot, and you need to remember to wash your mouth out every time or you’ll get thrush.

Eventually, I could quit this inhaler for 2 years when I moved abroad in clean environment. However, due to my unhealthy lifestyle I had to start this inhaler 2 years back again.

BUT I couldn’t get off it...prior to this I might have used my ProAir inhaler twice a week, mainly when I was exposed to mold or very furry dogs.

I was 69 when I was put on the drug so all of these symptoms were due to aging...don’t think so as I didn’t have any of these problems prior to Symbicort. The most insidious part is that it attacks your muscles, weakens them and you need your core muscles to breath...polio attacked muscles...they developed the iron lung to allow people to breath.

Was on a prednisone for months and we all know the side effects of that. After a combo of Qvar and Symbicort, I started just taking the Symbicort. Symbicort, at first, seemed to be the only inhaler that worked for me and didn’t give me any side effects. From reading all the comments, I think I have had every side effect mentioned! Blurry vision, stomach problems, feet cramps often, horrible anxiety, racing heart, sleep problems, back pain, chest feeling like on fire, dizziness, shortness of breath, now knee pain , you name it. I didn’t immediately connect it with the Symbicort but have been more seriously thinking that direction lately especially hearing everyone else’s experience here. It would all have to be related when I have never had any issues like this before- I think it is linked to long term use.",Debbie
53,Symbicort,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 25, 2019",42,"In January of this year I caught an upper respiratory infection which caused chest tightness.  I visited my allergist who put me on Symbicort 180 - 2 puffs morning and night.   I used it for only 5 days and only once a day for the last 3 days.  I developed larygospasm (thought I was suffocating), dysphonia, pharingitis, and dysphasia.  I stopped using it two weeks ago.    I just saw an ENT who diagnosed (I believe misdiagnosed) me with Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), and presbylarynx.  She prescribed ZANTAC and Prilosec for LPR and is sending me to a speech therapist for my vocal issues.    I had NONE of these symptoms prior to using Symbicort two weeks ago.  I will see the speech therapist but refuse to take either a Proton Pump inhibitor or and H2 blocker as I do not have LPR, I have throat damage from using Symbicort.

I actually had  pieces of my throat come up when I cough.  And they were falling off the roof of my mouth.  After two days of gargling with salt water that cleared up and I gargle every time I use the inhaler now.  Sinuses only getting mucus-ier.  Short of breath and coughing. Headaches are not welcome and my last complaint is a deal breaker.  I just cannot continue this drug because it is causing me to have vaginal bleeding.

After around 3 weeks on Symbicort (one puff a day as prescribed) my breathing was starting to go downhill and I woke one night with a resting pulse of 120. My heartbeat was heavy, I felt really dreadful, and it was obvious to me that the bronchodilator part of the Symbicort was now dangerous for me. I stopped taking Symbicort the next day. Within a day or so my heart-rate was normal and I felt so much better.
