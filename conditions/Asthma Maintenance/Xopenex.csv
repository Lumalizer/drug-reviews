0,Xopenex,Asthma Maintenance,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 2, 2018",6,"I was on Xopenex for about a year and it made me crazy. I have never experienced this with any other asthma drug. By crazy, I mean more anxious and scared than I have ever felt in my life, really unbearable. It took a long time to figure out that it was the drug. It worked fine against asthmatic episodes, but I can't recommend it.",Ann B.

2,Xopenex,Asthma Maintenance,10,,"January 26, 2012",18,"After taking albuterol (and various brands of albuterol) for years, I got a chance to try Xopenex almost a year ago, and I love it!  I used to be scared to take albuterol, because it made me so shaky, even at only half the perscribed dose.  But I can take the full dosage of Xopenex prescribed without feeling shaky at all!",Anonymous

4,Xopenex,Asthma Maintenance,10,,"December 9, 2009",25,It works so much better than albuterol. It doesn't make you choke and there is little or no heart racing after using it.,Anonymous
