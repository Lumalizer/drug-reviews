0,Singulair,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 10, 2021",1,"Singulair caused suicidality for me. But it was a very strange kind of suicidality because it was very cold and intense. I didn’t feel super distressed or sad or even depressed I just felt very clear that I should plan for my death and make it happen. Luckily, I realized that was weird and connected to the medication. As soon as I stop the medication the suicidal ideation went away. This medication could’ve literally cost me my life and it shouldn’t be on the market.",Lucylight
1,Singulair,Asthma Maintenance,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 7, 2021",8,I used to have trouble breathing. Would exhale a deep breath and wheeze and cough. I would have to hit my reliever inhaler 3 to 4 times a day. I would wake up at least twice a night to hit my inhaler. I am allergic to nature. I took Singulair for the first night a day ago and slept through the night. Woke up able to breath. I also have been in a very good mood. Not sure if thats because I can breath or got a good night's sleep. Either way its because of Singulair.,Doodle

Started nebulizer yesterday to complement Advair.  I will try Montelukast again.  Mood wise I did not notice anything significant.  Anxiety per MS is a given-like living on the edge of a cliff.

I get very short of breath regardless of if I am sitting or walking.  I have a constant runny nose so thought I would try Singulair.  I was on it a week and it made my struggling to breathe worse.  I stopped taking it and I feel much better.  I think singulair made the mucous viscous and hard so I couldn't get rid of it.  Hence, my breathing got worse.  I get very very fatigued.  I m sad as I was hoping this would work for me.",CEeCee

I have asthma triggered by inhalants and the original version has totally controlled my symptoms. I used the generic when it came out because of cost.

11,Singulair,Asthma Maintenance,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 5, 2017",30,"Singulair has been a godsend to help control my daily asthma symptoms due to allergenic/mold triggers. I haven't noticed it make a difference with exercise or smoke triggers, but it definitely helps reduce frequency/severity of asthma symptoms in general. If I take a few days to pick up my prescription, I can absolutely feel a difference in my lung health. I've been waiting the past few days to get the entire prescription renewed with my doctor and I had a nighttime attack last night for the first time since I started taking the medicine (it's been six days since I last took it).

Suffered insomnia, anxiety, and  being with insomnia all night went into a deep sleep. When my daughter arrived had a memory lapse and being questioned by my daughter was giving  incoherent replies. After being questioned for a while I regained conciousness of my daily routine. I imagine I had a blackout experience.  Now I'm trying to get original singulair since I did use it before when I was younger and had none of this experience. I did quit taking this generic form montelukast medication since the next day after quitting I slept very well. Will try to purchase singulair in it's original form.",Marsol

I'm another person who has mood effects from taking Singular, and in addition, it's affecting my ability to enjoy certain flavors.  It feels like an antihistamine, sort of, causing my mouth to feel dry, and I feel thirsty a lot.  I'd live with that, but I am experiencing this weird agitation that's quite uncomfortable.  I'm very aware of it, and I'm an adult, not a kid, so I probably won't bite anybody's head off.  However, I think it might not be worth it to me and I think I'll stop it for a few days to compare how I feel then with what I'm feeling now.",NorCalM

17,Singulair,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 23, 2015",47,"I've been stepping up and up since I was diagnosed with asthma. First it was just Ventolin, then we added Clenil Modulite, then Seretide 50/25 at Christmas, up to Seretide 125/25 a few weeks later, adding in Avamys nasal spray for hayfever and Acrivastine for hayfever and Type 1 latex allergy, then finally adding on Montelukast.Sadly, unlike some of the other people on here, I haven't been able to get down to just Montelukast. However, I'd say it's a miracle pill! I play ice hockey and overnight I went from tight chest and coughing and wheezing after hockey (I have CVA so wheezing is weird) to being totally fine. I still struggle if I max out, so I have to change out regularly but I play forward so that's easy enough. It's just great!!!",servewithmintsauce

He was officially diagnosed with asthma when he was 2. He had been flown to a children's hospital and that's where he was diagnosed. He was put on a Flovent inhaler. This cut down on our ER trips, but not totally. We figured out that his asthma attacks were triggered by wind storms, allergy related things etc. They then put him on Singulair.

I call it my Magic pill with no obvious side effects despite having many other allergies. I didn't find it helped my hay fever though so take 1/2an antihistamine as well in summer when humid and winter when smoke from fires around.  I went from high dose cortisone puffers and using Ventolin most of the day still being breathless and wheezing all the time to breathing free within 4 days of starting and off all puffers within the week.  Due to cost about a year in was running out so cut down to 1/2 tablet which still left me free of the asthma so then tried a 1/4 and found this still worked, so have continued on this since then.

My doctor has written me a prescription for brand Singulair.  The pharmacy gave me the three pills they had in stock and ordered the rest to come in tomorrow.  I did the same thing a few weeks ago with another pharmacy and their distributor no longer carries the brand.  Hopefully this will not happen again tomorrow and I can go back on the brand Singulair.

This medication has given me a life that is free of fear from episodes of asthma attacks. Before this medication I was using a steroid inhaler and short acting and long acting.

I take it every night and rarely have to use my inhaler. Since I also have seasonal allergies, there is usually a short period of time when I find I need a puff from my inhaler, but it's not often.Any and all medications can cause side effects and everyone will have different experiences, but I feel that the risk was worth it! The only real issue I believe may be associated with Singulair is excessive dryness in my nose that causes sores every now and again. I feel comfortable staying on Singulair because being able to breath easily far outweighs the one side effect I have.",Yuman Human
27,Singulair,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,,"January 31, 2013",56,Inhaler from allergist didn't help breathing problems. I always felt the fresh air I breathed in only got half way down and then hit a filter of some sort. Had wheezing/whistles every day at the end of my exhale. Inhaler didn't help. Out of breath over the slightest activity.  Got an prescription from family practice doc for this. This has eliminated my wheezing and out of breath feeling. I'm allergic to just about everything year round. It did not eliminate my need for allergy medication but it has made my breathing perfect.

We finally decided that we would take him off to see if the Singulair was the cause.  We noticed changes in him the first day he was off of it.
