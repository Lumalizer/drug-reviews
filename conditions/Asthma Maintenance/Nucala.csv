0,Nucala,Asthma Maintenance,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 6, 2021",0,I have  had severe asthma  for most of my adult life . Despite oral and inhaled steroids my asthma was poorly controlled . Three years ago I began treatment with Nucala and my condition has improved significantly. After the first dose an improvement  occurred and now my health is much better than it was 7 years ago when due to ill health I was forced to take medical retirement. This drug has worked so well for me and I'm so grateful to be given it .,Lilly kitty
