Year later insurance changed and was put back on Qvar.  Symptoms are gone and lung function up and almost normal!! Thank god!",51
1,Flovent HFA,Asthma Maintenance,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 22, 2020",7,I have COPD and CHF. Combined they left me unable to walk more than a couple hundred meters without stopping to catch my breath and recharge my weak legs.

2,Flovent HFA,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 15, 2019",10,"My son was diagnosed with asthma at 5 years old. It has gotten worse as he's aged. Within the last 2 years, peaking. I was giving him Albuterol up to 4 times a day, a day when he got sick, we were in the E. R often. Finally we got a new pediatric doc, and they prescribed Flovent. This drug is great. My son now only uses his rescue Inhaler when he has a lot of chest congestion. The Flovent allows him to run, play, and go all day without Albuterol! So glad we found it. And no side effects at all.",Chris
3,Flovent HFA,Asthma Maintenance,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 1, 2019",13,"I've been on Flovent for a number of years, & it is the only asthma medicine that has ever worked for me. I am now 73, & have had asthma since my late 30's. I had tried many treatments, & had to use my rescue inhaler quite often, but after being on Flovent, I now only have to do 1 puff every other day for maintenence. The only side affect has been a scratchy throat & phlegm in the mornings, & it has affected my voice a bit. But that is worth it, being able to breathe!",Bean

5,Flovent HFA,Asthma Maintenance,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 15, 2018",7,"I had been wheezing for a while, went to ER, was treated for Upper Respiratory Infection. About a month later wheezing started again my Doctor sent me to asthma specialist who put me on Albuterol, later had to be taken off.  I've been through so much in the last year. One of my doctors put me on flovent about two weeks ago, I couldn't sleep for wheezing and coughing. After a couple of days on flovent I notice I wasn't coughing or wheezing anymore, I feel a lot better, I think its because of the carpet in my apartment, so did my Doctor.",Penny

11,Flovent HFA,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 13, 2014",18,"My son has taken this medication for asthma maintenance for nearly 4 years. When he takes it consistently, he has very few asthma exacerbations. Before he was on it, he had to be hospitalized due to a severe attack and status asthmaticus. When he missed it for a few days, he had another exacerbation requiring emergency treatment. I'd say the medicine is effective for him. He has had no side effects.",KatieW04
