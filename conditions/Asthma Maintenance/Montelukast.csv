But it was a very strange kind of suicidality because it was very cold and intense. I didn’t feel super distressed or sad or even depressed I just felt very clear that I should plan for my death and make it happen. Luckily, I realized that was weird and connected to the medication. As soon as I stop the medication the suicidal ideation went away. This medication could’ve literally cost me my life and it shouldn’t be on the market.",Lucylight

I was one of those who swore by this drug at first because it was helping my asthma. But then I slowly noticed lack of energy, insomnia, depression, mood swings, lighter shorter periods, Etc. All of which could not be explained even with countless test. Then I started having weird dreams, then came the night sweats, and then the WORST symptom of all PANCREATITIS!! Which again the doctors were confused as to why I developed this all of a sudden with no cause. I don’t smoke, don’t drink, don’t do drugs yet some how my pancreas enzymes were through the roof. I couldn’t eat or drink without having pain I went down to eating once a day only to take my meds at night. The nausea, vomiting, and pain were unbearable. As of 11/04/2021 an ER doctor recommended I stop taking Singular as it was the only thing linked to all my other symptoms. The doctors are hopeful my pancreas will recover and my other symptoms will subside. DON'T TAKE THIS!!",Samantha
3,Montelukast,Asthma Maintenance,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 20, 2021",0,"This maintenance medicine helped me with asthmatic affects from allergens from intense pollen or mold seasons, and I also very much appreciate the precautions for mental health effects, released not long ago by the FDA. Physicians may emphasize the maintenance i.e. daily intake of the medicine, but pharmacists often see this medicine prescribed for seasonal durations, so confirming with my area pharmacist was pinnacle with some sleep agitations I experienced after ongoing use of the prescription. You may find it helpful to be open to these facts. For me, a 2-month ongoing intake of this medicine is a max, and a pharmacist explained he in fact most often sees patients prescribed it in 1-2 months durations, often for related allergy seasons. I had the best results coinciding with my routine loratadine 10mg maintenance antihistamine, which proves helpful year-round.",pollen tears

I have (had) been taking Montelukast on and off since 2 years now without any side effect.  I could sleep easily after taking a pill each night.  However innocuous the small pills may seem, I didn't want to get addicted to it.  After taking it on and off for 2 years, I just googled the side effects (so late) and saw such horrible experiences.I would instead recommend to take natural anti-histamine/anti-allergy food.

It felt like these vivid dreams would last all night. I was falling asleep earlier and waking up later. Sleeping 10+ hours and wake feeling I had not slept any. The dreams turned into vivid nightmares waking me. I was exhausted. I was in a constant fog and my brain and body didn't want to function. I stopped montelukast 6 days ago. I don't feel normal yet. Still dreaming and tired but the dreams are less vivid and not scary. I'm still sore and worn out and I've had an achey stomach since I stopped but I'm not sure if its an effect of this. The only positive is it did help the asthma and now that I stopped I can feel it again. I will take asthma over the effects of this medication any day though.

However, out of desperation, I too decided to give this medicine a chance, especially since I knew several older people who were taking this. I have terrible depression and anxiety as I came from an abusive family, however I have NOT had any problems what so ever with the CVS pharmacy Teva manufacturer (Genetic) Montelukast Sodium 10mg tablets. I have been taking this medicine for 14 days. It does help with the asthma and allergies but I highly recommend allergy testing and allergy injections if needed as injections are more effective along with taking Montelukast. I think the problem that others are having could be a manufacturer problem as each manufacturer must use a different formula from the other. Also, this medicine is NOT for children or young adults so be warned! I have nothing but good things to say about this medicine however as with any medicine, use extreme caution.

She becomes very angry quickly, having random outbursts. Has night terrors and hyperactivity.  Cries uncontrollably about seemingly nothing. Can’t cope with the smallest of things. Is always thirsty and the list goes on and on. How can 4mg that helps so amazingly with her breathing do such awful things to her? I read the leaflet again and again and all the symptoms she was getting were in the uncommon section so I naturally thought I had got it wrong.

At first it was not connected until recently when information came out that Singulair could cause ear infections. This particular side effect appeared about 3-4 months after starting Singulair but no connectione was made until recently after using it for two years. So be aware of side effects and keep close tabs on usage results.",Anonymous

I have always used albuterol (inhaler and nebulizer) for fast acting relief, along with steroid preventative inhalers. Two years ago when I was diagnosed yet again with pneumonia, my new doctor prescribed Singulair. I am an active person, who likes to run etc. Until Singulair I had never in my lifetime ran without having to use my albuterol both before and after. Not only that, this year I made it through flu season without developing pneumonia. Until I used Singulair I had never known what it felt like to be ""normal"". To run and exist without having to stop because I was wheezing and couldn't breathe.",gutz4glory_911

I couldn't climb stairs without needing a ""puff"". I couldn't play with the kids without having to stop often. After one serious attack I had to use an atomizer at the doctors office and I started Singulair from the next day. I have not used or carried an inhaler for almost 10 years now.

I was put on a course of prednisolone to relieve symptoms, then doctor tried to control asthma with inhalers.  Couldn't get under control with only the inhalers so was prescribed Singulair.  It is amazing, I hardly use my reliever. Before I was using anything up to 40 times a day.  Hayfever symptoms reduced also.  Able to run again, I'd reached the point where I could hardly walk never mind run.  Now I'm starting to get my life back.",Anonymous

I haven't had to use a rescue inhaler for over 2 years. I don't need a steriod inhaler either. I had an anaphylatic reaction from allergy shots, so oral medicines are the way to go for me. Now I only have to take Allegra and Singulair and I am virtually symptom free after years of frustration and near death.",MDDONG
