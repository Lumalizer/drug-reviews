0,Tiotropium,Asthma Maintenance,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 15, 2021",0,"Spiriva Respimat (tiotropium):Have complicated medical history including Addison's Disease, Pure Autonomic Failure, and many other secondary conditions. I have uncontrolled cough variant asthma. My Dr had me on 1.25 mcg last year when I struggled for 5 months to control my cough. This year I'm on 2.5 mcg. I'm on day 5 and this morning I ruptured a tendon in my wrist. I'm not sure if it's related, but the timeframe would indicate a possible correlation. Also, I have severe dry mouth, sores inside my mouth, and blurry vision. Lastly, when I take the inhaler, it triggers a bronchospasm, so now I start breathing in just before I activate the stream. I think it is working, but I am on 21 meds, so I can't be 100% certain.",copsgurl07
1,Tiotropium,Asthma Maintenance,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 26, 2021",2,Spiriva Respimat (tiotropium):My big beef is the packaging. Every month there is a new plastic inhaler. There is no option for a refill. The cost to the individual and the environment could be a lot lower with just a little effort. My second beef is that I have a constant sore throat.,Barbara
2,Tiotropium,Asthma Maintenance,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 1, 2021",2,"Spiriva Respimat (tiotropium):New drug for my asthma, first day fine.. second day, the first dose caused a massive choking spasm episode to which almost made me throw up while I choked and coughed for my life. It felt like that and was a horrible experience. No other asthma medication has ever done this and I now scared to keep using it. I could not get my breath back properly for at least 5 minutes. Why oh why do they have to use such a non user friendly delivery system.. its awkward and hard to hold",Tori
3,Tiotropium,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,,"March 22, 2021",6,Spiriva Respimat (tiotropium):I used my Respimat inhaler today. It was brand new. When I hit the button and inhaled it felt like I got stung on my lip. It burned for over an hour. Now I'm worried because my lungs are burning. I'm call my doctor and my lawyer in the morning.,Mac
4,Tiotropium,Asthma Maintenance,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 19, 2020",23,"Spiriva Respimat (tiotropium):I have been using Spiriva for a short time and I now have a constant cough, headaches and a burning throat. I have now read the list of side effects and it seems, for me, that it is going to cause more problems short and possibly long term. I find it concerning.Will discuss with my doctor to come off it. I donâ€™t feel confident on it. Buteyko breathing technique and exercises saved my life 28 years ago and I was off all my drugs, including the nebuliser which I used many times a day. I  will go be back to that I think. Very concerned about the side effects I have experienced so far.",MA
5,Tiotropium,Asthma Maintenance,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 21, 2019",10,Spiriva Respimat (tiotropium):This has been effective in conjunction with Qvar in a way LABA drugs like advair have not been. Worth trying if you have not been finding relief with ICS/LABA combos. THe manufacturer has a coupon that gave me no copays - I know this is only for a year but makes it worth trying I think.,Larry
6,Tiotropium,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 27, 2019",17,Spiriva Respimat (tiotropium):Well I just started taking this drug last week because of the bad bronchitis I had and coughing a lot ..well I looked up on some side effects of this medication and I decided I'm not going to use this as my inhaler. My doctor gave me a few samples to try and I don't like how it makes me feel .. I get really dizzy and having thrush in my throat doesn't help at all either...,Ritz
7,Tiotropium,Asthma Maintenance,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 17, 2019",13,Spiriva Respimat (tiotropium):Only thing that has kept me from using a whole Albuterol inhaler every 10 days,Littleemt
8,Tiotropium,Asthma Maintenance,,,"August 13, 2018",22,Spiriva Respimat (tiotropium):Almost broke the twisthaler just now. First time using it. What a waste of money. They could have put the medicine in a little easy-to-use puffer inhaler but then they could not charge so much for it. They think people are stupid. What a gimmick. Hope this stuff works but the damn mist made me cough and choke . I have no illusions that the medicine will not have a load of side effects like all the rest.,Pearlymae
9,Tiotropium,Asthma Maintenance,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 7, 2018",21,"Spiriva Respimat (tiotropium):I have been using Spiriva*Respimat 2.5 mcg along with Zenhale MDI 5/200mcg for a year now and in that short period I've acquired so much bloating to my face and body and have gained almost 50 lbs using these two drugs.  I now have severe breathing problems, cannot go upstairs and/or for a walk without panting/huffing/ breathing heavier where sometimes I cannot take a breath (than I ever did before taking these two puffers) ... which is very scary. I was on two other Asthma medication before which never caused me any side effects. Am going to go back to them and hopefully will lose the extra pounds I've put on and in the few days since I've stopped taking these two puffers my breathing has improved quite a lot.",none
10,Tiotropium,Asthma Maintenance,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 26, 2016",0,I have had intolerances to several inhalers. This is the first maintenance inhaler that I have been able to use with great success and NO side effects! It's the best thing I have found to control my asthma - ever!,Dalton girl
