0,Rocephin,Otitis Media,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 30, 2019",7,"I had a shot of Rocephin 1g in my (R) gluteus 1 week and 1 day ago. The pain upon injection was a 5.5 on a scale of 10. It is a big shot and it takes several seconds to administer.This was to treat a middle ear infection which turned out to be a burst eardrum.The ear started getting better (less pain and less full feeling) within 24-hours, but the pain from the shot is still a 2-2.5 on a scale of 10, 8 days after administration.",Sarah
1,Rocephin,Otitis Media,9,,"October 31, 2011",11,"I have been given this for otitis media and upper respiratory infections. It is a good ""kick start"" but the full effect is only achieved after a three-day course of injections. It works but is quite painful, especially for pediatric patients.",Anonymous

Keeping the oral antibiotics down is difficult then after 10 days its still not gone. Thanks for Rocephin it is the only thing that really gets the job done. Why have your little one suffer?,tkk1229
3,Rocephin,Otitis Media,10,,"September 1, 2009",22,My son had sever ear infection and was placed on two different antibiotics. Neither worked. After having FIVE straight days of a fever of 104 and vomiting the doctor gave my two year old a shot of Rocephin and his fever was gone by the next morning and his ears started to clear up. Thank you to the makers of this medicine. ,Anonymous
