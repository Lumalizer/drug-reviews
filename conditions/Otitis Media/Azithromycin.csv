0,Azithromycin,Otitis Media,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 23, 2021",0,"Have taken a handful of times in my life. I used to get bad sinus infections, that has stopped, because I started taking powdered elderberry capsules and a whole food multi vitamin daily. This antibiotic is hit or miss. It depends on the severity of your sickness. I have asked for 2 zpacks in the past when I have had bad sicknesses and that has worked. I am currently taking for a (moderate) ear infection and it is definitely working.However, TAKE A GOOD PROBIOTIC! But wait a few hours after your dose!  I take the Vaginal Care kind because it has a ton of strains and yeast fighting enzymes. You will probably get diarrhea from these antibiotics. I also can’t sleep, and having anxiety and irritable. But, sometimes you just have to take one for the team. For anxiety, I take ashwaghanda and lemon balm gummies. have urged my husband (who is prone to pneumonia) to urge the Dr for 2 zpacks, because this one has a tendency to knock it down and not out",Erwin Rommel
1,Azithromycin,Otitis Media,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 10, 2021",2,"This medicine is terrible. I am 36 weeks pregnant and was prescribed it for an ear infection. While it has helped with the stuffy feeling in my ear a bit, it has gave me some pretty bad side effects. I have done nothing but vomit since being on this med, my heart starts racing, I get terrible stomach cramps and have diarrhea. All of that within an hour or 2 after taking it. I’ve winded up in the hospital 3 times requiring fluids due to becoming dehydrated because of the vomiting.",Hi

5,Azithromycin,Otitis Media,4,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 26, 2016",8,"Received this as an alternative to other anti biotics because of my ibs and how bad they normally wreck my stomach. First about 16 hours went along very smoothly as I took the 2 250 mg doses and immediately went down hill. I liked mom stop for over an hour. The very next morning I stayed home from work, took another pill at about 8:30 am, and did alright thru the day until about midnight when I woke up to stomach gurgling and severe nausea/headache",Skwillz

7,Azithromycin,Otitis Media,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 15, 2016",32,"I am allergic to penicillin so Zithromax is the alternative before getting into the heavy stuff like Cipro and Levaquin.  I have been taking Zithromax for years and always get relief around day 3.  The loose stools are normal, it means Zithromax is working and the bacteria is being flushed out of your system.",Johnnylakis
8,Azithromycin,Otitis Media,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 14, 2015",29,"Zithromax (azithromycin):Woke up due to severe vertigo. Diagnosis of Otitis Media (at 43?

9,Azithromycin,Otitis Media,3,,"February 11, 2015",20,"Yes, it got rid of my ear infection after the generic was prescribed at a CVS Minute Clinic. HOWEVER (BIG however), I ended up getting strep. My GP said that the generic does not have as long a 1/2 life as the brand name. So, the 5-day dose (which is supposed to stay in your system for up to 10 days) does not last long enough. As a result, you can either end up with the original infection coming back, or make yourself susceptible to a second infection. So now I had to go on Cipro for 10 days to get rid of the strep! This is the kind of thing that produces super bugs--thank you, insurance cos., corner-cutting pharma cos. and especially the FDA for approving substandard generics!",Cyndi07
