0,Augmentin,Otitis Media,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 13, 2021",1,"Took this for a severe ear infection and man did I feel so bad on and after taking this. I had horrible migraines starting on day 2 and ending 48 hr after finishing the full 2 x d, 10 day prescription. My ear infection actually got worse while on this and I spiked a fever on day 8. I was really hoping this would have helped and maybe for some it does however, for me I would prefer to never take this again. After this, I was put on a different medication and have had much better results.",BG46342
1,Augmentin,Otitis Media,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 2, 2021",2,"Prescribed 1000 mg 2x a day for ear infection and painful sinuses. Took the first 9 doses with food and probiotics. Sinuses and ears are better (right ear is not 100% yet). After dose 9 I started having indigestion pains. These pains lasted from 8 pm to 4 am (consistent with info about the drug’s half-life). I couldn’t sleep, had to stay sitting up. It was not fun. I did not take any the next day. I’ve called my doctor about switching to plain old amoxicillin.",Nikki
2,Augmentin,Otitis Media,8.0,,"June 3, 2021",4,"I took 875mg 2 x per day. It cleared up my ear infection however I had diarrhea for most of the 4 days I was taking it. It was a constant diarrhea too and a few times it just happened, I wasn’t able to control it.  I took with a probiotic each day. I felt nauseous each day and each time I took it. I also felt very out of sorts mentally and felt like I struggled doing my job and felt anxiety. The day I didn’t take it during work I felt much better and back to normal. I dropped after five days and do not intend to take again. This was a terrible experience.",CommanderShep
3,Augmentin,Otitis Media,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 19, 2021",1,Never again. Actually I have taken this before no problems. This time different story! Not sure why they gave me such a high dose. Dr told me to wait a few days before starting to see if ear pain cleared as my ear really wasn’t inflamed. I did just though but then figured I would just take it. I got 5 doses in me before the stomach pain started. Now I also have weird tingling and leg pains. So I dumped them! Hopefully my side effects resolve as quickly as they came. I also am starting to get a yeast infection!,Sweetchks
4,Augmentin,Otitis Media,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 25, 2019",18,"A 10 day round of this did not heal my middle ear infection. The day after I finished the antibiotics I woke up with the same symptoms that I presented with 10 days prior. I had some vertigo feelings around day 6 or 7, but maybe it was just the infection spreading. I had no side effects, but it also didn't work.",Anbrow
5,Augmentin,Otitis Media,2.0,,"February 12, 2019",7,"First, let me start by saying that I don't really do well with antibiotics. I was diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2005 (positive blood test), and I've had autoimmune issues ever since. For some reason antibiotics tend to make me feel really bad, but there are times when I'm left with no choice but to take them. So...I was diagnosed last week with a severe ear infection. Ruptured eardrum, draining ear. Anyway, I had to take an antibiotic and this was the one prescribed. I was prescribed this at 1000mg/2 times per day. First and second day I felt a little run down, but attributed it to the infection. Pretty much the same with the third and fourth day, but a little more intense. By the 5th and 6th day I literally felt like I was losing my mind. Felt super weak, anxious, and panic attacks galore! Today was my 8th day on the medication and I literally almost called 911 tonight! My heart was beating so fast, legs were super weak, head was spinning...just felt horrific!",ANicole
6,Augmentin,Otitis Media,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 20, 2018",28,"This is the only medication that works for my chronic ear infections. I get 5-6 ear infections per year, I’m 23 so not a common problem at my age. The last two infections I ruptured my ear drum, which is extremely painful, but within 1 days of taking augmentin the drainage has stopped and after 3 days the pain is completely gone. I usually notice some GI issues, but I can deal with it for how well this medication clears the infection.",MD8700
7,Augmentin,Otitis Media,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 11, 2018",3,"So much pressure in my ears so I was prescribed augmentin.  Couple days in I notice my left arm kinda hurts but paid no attention. Start having very large and constant bowel movements that smell like the pills lol. On the 9th day I break out in a cold sweat, fever, terrible left arm pain, and muscle weakness. Go to urgent care thinking I'm having a heart attack. Discontinue drug. Symptoms still persist and I think I have tendonitis in my left shoulder now. Very dizzy and weak despite stopping medication 4 days ago.",Anonymous
8,Augmentin,Otitis Media,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2018",4,"I was prescribed Augmentin for healing my ear infection. I threw up shortly after taking the first dose, I felt dizzy and very unwell. I will never take this medicine again. I feel worse than I did before taking it. Amoxicillin by itself should do the trick, without all the side effects of Augmentin.",Carmen

10,Augmentin,Otitis Media,,,"January 3, 2018",3,"It made me throw up, dizzy, stomach ache and pale skin on first dose.  I have a double ear infection. I did not gave any of the symptoms prior to taking it. I only had extreme pain in ears.",Double ear infection.
11,Augmentin,Otitis Media,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 5, 2017",8,"So far its slowly working for my ear infection. The pain has lessened but still have  mild pain. I'm on my 4th day. Hopefully in 6 days the ear will be completely healed. There are some minor side effects I have noticed. Particularly some joint pain but it is not bad and mild. Maybe a little nausea in my stomach too, but very mild. I'm just happy my pain has lessened in the ears.I took the augmetin generic for Amoxicillin/clauvantic acid 875mg twice daily for 10 days.",dikeee
12,Augmentin,Otitis Media,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 1, 2017",12,I have chronic ear problems and ear infections. I had on ear drum rupture and the other had fluid behind the ear drum. I am no stranger to antibiotics. It's day 7 and my stomach started rejecting the antibiotic so I missed a dose. I just got some activia and I am going to try to finish the med. My ears have cleared up for sure though. I can hear great it really cleared out any infection. My sinuses feel great too. I honestly think 7 days is enough for this med especially if you get a super strong dose but I want to finish it I don't want ear infections to come back. Take with milk and buy some activia yogurt for sure.,Earlady
13,Augmentin,Otitis Media,9.0,,"May 31, 2017",13,"This medication has always worked great for me whenever I have an ear infection...much better than the regular Amoxicillin too. However, be sure to follow your doctor's orders by taking this medicine with food while getting enough probiotics as it will give you stomach problems along with diarrhea if you don't comply.",jmcd2017

19,Augmentin,Otitis Media,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 15, 2014",15,"I took this when I had acute externa otitis media. My ear was hurting really badly and it was swelled up. I couldn't sleep on the side of the affected ear, couldn't open my jaw wide enough to eat/yawn. It was horrid. I was prescribed 10 tabs (twice a day) and after my prescription, the swelling reduced significantly and also my skin looks amazing. I do not have any side effects. But I love what this medicine has done to my skin especially. I do get very bad breakouts at time, especially when I keep my make up on for too long. Even my colleagues commented on how clean my face looks at the moment. ",xxxleeannaxxx

The first two days were great and he felt better within hours of taking it, but by third day his stomach was so messed up.  Took Probiotics and gave yogurt, but 4 blow out diapers in a matter of hours, followed by nausea, and his booty was so red that he couldn't even sit down.  The side effects were to severe and had to take him off as his little system could not withstand 10 days of it.",MommyMel
