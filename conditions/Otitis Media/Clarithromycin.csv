1,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 3, 2021",0,"So far I am on day 3/5 with this for a painful ear infection. My pain went away almost completely on day two so I’m assuming things are working as intended. My only problem is the side effects. I have heart palpitations for a few hours after taking a dose. While I get heart palpitations occasionally, this medication definitely makes them more frequent. Also, they taste is absolutely horrendous. People are saying it’s not that bad, but for me it tastes like constant envelope glue in my mouth for 11 hours straight. I’ve tried gum, snacking, brushing my teeth/tongue, mouthwash. The pill itself is bitter, but the taste that practically excretes from my saliva lasts for 11 hours. Then an hour later, I have to take the next dose, so it’s really a constant taste. I would chew gum constantly, but it irritates my ear infection and my jaw. Otherwise, this med is doing its job. The taste is terrible but to me it is bearable as long as it’s working.",Jessica J
2,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,3.0,,"April 18, 2021",0,"I was given this antibiotic, I was on it for 7 days after the first 2 I felt better and then towards the end I felt awful, I asked for my usual antibiotic that works flucloxillin but was told this one was better as amoxicillin doesn't work at all, I went back to the gp who give me a second lot of the same antibiotic,  not in doubt I will be contacting my gp Monday for the one I originally asked for!  I had. A metallic taste in my mouth and nausea from taking the antibiotic everything tasted of metal and I was awake at night in pain still, I think it depends on the person but I didn't find this antibiotic very good it's first time I've taken it and I wouldn't recommend it.",Harribo 12

I started to feel well on the fluoxetine but then got a ear infection so the doctor prescribed these, after two days of taking 500mg twice per day I had to stop, these gave me EXTREME anxiety, my memory was bad, I lost track of time in those days I took them, I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't think straight I thought I was going crazy!!I've read on the internet these antibiotics have caused this to happen to hundreds or even thousands of people. They should be taken of the market.DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!",Karla

5,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 19, 2021",0,"I know this is going too sound awful but relieved too read your comments...I've just finished my second dose of this today in fact I was on it bout 6 weeks ago for chronic sinitus. The first time I took it I had the normal nausea. This time I thought I was going mad. Until I read the comments. I went too the doctors cos I was experiencing off balance, dizziness and ringing in my ears.  I was diagnosed ear infection and this time on taking this medication the dizziness worse in fact all symptoms still there. I have. a horrible taste, I haven't slept properly either. In fact the more I think about it the more it seems that I've been like that since first time round, palpitations and I'm sure I've been experiencing hallucinations. I never will I take this again. I am unable too take anything with penicillin which is a shame. Also tremors havent gone.I hope that the side effects ease off in the next 24 hours.",Tracy

I’m 4 days in now and my stomach is feeling terrible with major gastrointestinal issues, nausea, headaches, loss of appetite and terrible insomnia and broken sleep.

9,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 18, 2020",3,"Clarithromycin is honestly the worst drug I have EVER taken. Anxiety, restlessness, the WORST taste in my mouth and unquenchable thirst. I am only on my third tablet, I have 10 to take in total (2 x 500mg per day) I dread having to take it, last night was the first night and I must have slept for a max of 2 hours. Kept waking up with this horrible taste and feeling as if I was going to vomit. Taking this feels like I’ve been poisoned, and so far has done nothing to alleviate my ear infection or the pain it’s causing me. Never taking this stuff again.",Soffyaaah
10,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,1.0,,"October 23, 2020",3,"I'm on day two of Clarithromycin  dose = two 500mg tablets a day. Was given this for chronic ear infection after otomize spray didn't work, first day I had the awful metallic taste and nothing is making it go away. I can deal with the bad taste but the other side effects are horrendous including  palpitations, anxiety, panic attacks, crying, nausea, stomach cramps, shakes, tiredness. I'm on day 2 and I can't take anymore! I'll never ever take this medication again, unlucky for me it's a Friday evening so won't be able to speak to my gp to change the antibiotic.Reading everyone's reviews has helped as I was starting to panic about my side effects.Good luck and try get a different antibiotic if you can.",Howb

However my infection didn’t clear up straight away afterwards I was still experiencing leaking ear and smell. I rang and told my doctor and she prescribed me the same antibiotics. However this time around I am suffering with so many side affects after 3 days I have diarrhea and feeling sick my anxiety attacks have gone through the rough and feeling tight chested on top of all of that I am asthmatic hot and cold sweats and feeling really tired. I thought I was the only one so it has helped me reading everyone else’s reviews.",123
12,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,3.0,,"May 2, 2020",5,"Promised myself I'd write a review of this medication if I survived the week on it! Was terrified to take it having read the negative reviews and expected horrendous side effects. The brand name was Clonocid. It was the second antibiotic prescribed for an ear infection. It didn't solve the issue. The side effects for me weren't as bad as others reported. They do put an unpleasant taste in your mouth. I always took a glass of milk or yogurt after taking mine which helped. They are big tablets and I couldn't wait to be off them, but side effects were manageable. Did have a little insomnia and occasional headaches so I wouldn't be keen to take them again. Having said that, if they've been prescribed I wouldn't let the reviews here frighten you too much. A pharmacist advised me that the bad side effects are rare and sometimes be result of interaction with existing medications. Discussing my fears with them helped put my mind at ease so if you're still concerned, maybe chat to yours.",Spud
13,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 6, 2020",11,"I might as well have been prescribed POISON!☠️ than clairthromycin.  On day two my earache got worse and by day three I couldn’t sleep a wink.  Moreover I experienced stomach cramps, anxiety, panic attacks, groin pain, nausea, metallic zinc taste in the mouth, nightmares and finally suicidal ideation.My Doctor then prescribed me Flucloxacillin and only after one day it kicked in and my earache started to ease off.After reading the other reviews on Clarithromycin I realise I am not alone in my experience.  I think this ‘medication’ should have its license withdrawn and be banned in the UK.",Bilbo Baggins
14,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 24, 2020",9,"So I got put on clarithromycin for a week twice a day 500mg tablets for an ear infection. First tablet I was fine then the 2nd I was so ill! Being sick, feeling weak just awful. The dr refused to change them and give me anti sickness tabs to help. I’m on my last 2 tablets and I can’t believe I made it this far as right now they have made me so weak I feel like I can’t do anything. Drinking with a glass of milk does help. Anyone being put on these it’s a hard slog getting through it. I’m at the drs in a few days if my ear infection hasn’t cleared up I will be refusing these as il NEVER take them again. I've actually cried and  I feel that rubbish on them.",Tashy
15,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 30, 2019",7,"Doctor put me on this for an ear infection after swabs came back with bacterial infection. I’m fine with amoxicillin so he must’ve thought this drug would treat it better who knows. Anyway it worked great, my only gripes were the disgusting metallic taste which kept me up at night and it’s left me with thrush (I’m presuming...as 2 weeks after finishing course) I wanted to leave a review as there’s so many scary ones on here, it frightened me reading them but I’m glad I continued treatment. My side effects were bearable,as probably most people. Don’t forget we are all quick to complain and not as quick of the mark with positivity.",Lila
16,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 18, 2019",4,"I was put on Clarithromycin for a horrible middle and outer ear infection... was fully deaf in my right ear for a week and had excruciating pain. I'm allergic to Penicillin/Amoxicillin, and another drug they tried first made me violently ill, so they tried this one...  Clarithromycin worked, but I had really bad side effects like a lot of others are mentioning... lightheadedness, AWFUL anxiety, insomnia, racing heart, dizziness. I just felt so weak and could barely do my job at work. And that awful taste in the mouth!! There was just this nasty lingering bitterness for days. 4/10 because it was the best for me personally out of the antibiotics I've tried, but it's still bad. If I need antibiotics again I'll be sure to avoid this one.",horf
17,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,1.0,,"August 17, 2019",2,In one word  clarithromycin is horrendous.  I've never been so ill on an antibiotic in my life. Severe cramps in my stomach hallucinations that were no joke. By the 5th day I could not stand up from dizziness and weak muscles. My heart rate was ridiculously high also I've never been so sure I might die so never again for me. Good luck to those who sail through with it your the few not the majority just consider yourself lucky it wasn't you  that had the bad side effects from this stuff like me and many others who it is pure poison for. ,Collywolly
18,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 2, 2019",2,"I am a bit surprised by the comments that I have read here. I have had numerous ear infections as an adult, and a course of Clarithromycin has been the only antibiotic that has been able to fully clear the infection. My ENT Specialist was even entertaining the thought of permanent stents which would have decreased my hearing by 10%. Yes. I was completely nauseated and flat on my back for 10 days, but the infection thankfully DID clear. Foul taste? Could not smoke? Wait until you find yourself in a situation where NOTHING works.",Otitis Adult
19,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 2, 2019",2,"Had to take in addition to viral tablets and steroids as the sinusitis I had caused Bell’s Palsy at the same time so half of my face was paralysed.It cleared up my sinusitis but I had to switch to a different antibiotic by day 5 as the side effects were awful. Within 20 mins of taking it, my heart was racing and beating out of my chest.This has now given me long QT interval in my heart   for life and I’ve been on beta blockers since. I would advise to look for alternatives. This shouldn’t even be prescribed due to how often it causes heart problems",E

After one tab of clarithromycin 500mg my hearing improved and pain improved after second tab but so far very good response.   It’s important to drink plenty of water which minimises side effects.  I do have a bit of a strange taste.,Pennorth
23,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 23, 2018",1,"Was treated for possible middle ear infection. GP noticed inflamed ear drum. I had symptoms of dizziness, panic attacks, lightheadedness and blurred vision. Antibiotic didn't help probably because it was not bacterial infection. Also tried penicillin - didn't work. To this day have no idea what it was, but it is lasting two months already with symptoms changing and gradually reducing in intensity. Recently got hives. What helped was trip to psychologist and physiotherapy on my neck, because it was very stiff. Took for one week. Only side effect I got was bitter taste in the mouth but I honestly liked it because it tasted like gin and tonic :) Would recommend drinking course of probiotics to restore gut bacteria",iii

25,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,5.0,,"January 3, 2018",0,"I suffer with geniculate neuralgia and through my frustrations caused myself an agonising ear infection. I was happy to hear that I could clear it up with antibiotics. Along with taking 1000mg of this a day I am also using a spray, within an hour of taking my first tablet I felt awful.  I had  instant abdominal cramps,  was nauseous and feeling so weak that a 15 minute walk took twice as long and I also had a  foul taste in my mouth. As the days have passed..I can report that my ear infection is clearing up I hope, but I am constantly hungry, plus I have insomnia.. quite badly. I pray I never take these again.. other side effects too but they seem minor compared to some of the main ones.",Evelyn bow
26,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 3, 2017",5,"Clarithromycin is extremely effective but unfortunately, it tastes horrid and leaves a disgusting taste in your mouth, to get rid of the taste I recommend eating a banana and gargling some water. Though it is effective there are many side effects e.g, Diarrhoea, Nausea, Sickness and others. I am still taking Clarithromycin, I suffered from multiple symptoms, Motion Sickness, Diarrhoea and Nausea are the ones I suffer from but it could be different for someone else. If you do take Clarithromycin for Otitis the symptoms are added to the side effects, I still had a full feeling in my ear, problems with balance, ear ache and a head ache so be wary of that. I recommend resting and not moving your head fast/too much.",Kacey W

The first day I took the medication I experienced voracious hunger pains to where I had to eat a snack ever 30 mins to an hour. The next morning the hunger pains returned; thankfully I had brought a variety of snacks to work, or else I would have been in trouble. Terrible anxiety; I am not sure if it has exacerbated an already existing anxiety disorder or if I am nervous about being on the medicine. I am awake now in the middle of the night because of a irresistible cough. I am wondering if this is allergies or a side effect of the medicine. This is a horrible antibiotic and I am just praying I don't get the metallic taste in my mouth or the nightmares.",Coughing in Tennessee

Seems to be helping the infection now, however side effects are unlike any antibiotics I've had before. First tablet caused almost instantaneous diarrhoea and nausea. Every time I take a tablet my stomach gurgles, however (thankfully) no more toilet issues. The worst effect is the taste, I was paranoid I had terrible breath, asked a friend and she said she couldn't smell anything, so after reading other comments I've deduced its just me dealing with it!

Sure there were some side effects but it worked. I couldn't hear out of my left ear for almost 3 weeks and on day four of taking this med I'm seeing results.

33,Clarithromycin,Otitis Media,9.0,,"November 20, 2015",5,I had the flu which turned into sinusitis and congested ears. First they put me on cefuroxime and steroids. My ears got worse. Double ear infection. Finally after 8 days I had them switch to clarithromycin and it always knocks out my sinus issues. Immediately my fatigue and eyes felt better but the regurgitation is horrible. Racing heart when I am sleeping is a side effect as well. I definitely have more energy though thank god. Also my ears are starting to pop finally. Only 3 days out of 10 so I'm hoping I don't have to go get an antibiotic shot. I have an apt with ENT for a cat scan in 2 wks. Really hoping this clears up.,missmeliss1234
