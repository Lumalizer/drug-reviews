0,Cefdinir,Otitis Media,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 14, 2022",0,"Kinda conflicted about this medication. I was prescribed cefdinir for an ear infection. I also had a cough, was congested, and my voice was completely gone. The morning after taking the meds for a day I was so much better better. My voice was back, I still had congestion and a cough, but it was much better. The only downside was that I began having trouble sleeping (insomnia), which I never had in the past. It got to the point where I got about 2 hours of sleep a night and completely restless. I had to take a second round of antibiotics since after finishing the 10 days my sickness came back. I am now currently on the meds again and I haven’t slept in 24 hours. Avoid cefdinir if you can because I'm so  exhausted. Just get a different antibiotic! It also made my anxiety spoke terribly so if you have been diagnosed with anxiety Idon’t recommend this for you  either.",Kat
1,Cefdinir,Otitis Media,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2022",0,"They prescribed this to my 10 month old for an ear infection. She wasn’t showing any signs of infection but during her visit they discovered the infection. So they prescribed her Cifdinir and after first 2 doses I missed almost one day so instead of double dosing I just let her skip a dose. I feel terrible for missing a day but for stuff like this is, if I don’t set a timer, I miss the mark. However I know these symptoms aren’t from a missed dose, they’re from the medicine. She kept a temp of 102-104 so I took her to the ER and they told me the home remedies for breaking the fever so I did. But no matter how many times I broke it, it would rise again immediately. It got up to 104.7. I thought I was going to vomit seeing my baby look so miserable. She had diarrhea from it, she lost her appetite. She was like a limp noodle and she couldn’t get comfortable. I was so scared for my baby. But I don’t know if I should just abruptly stop giving it to her?",Lord's Child

She was complaining of ear pain one night, I took her into doc the next day & they gave her this antibiotic due to her not agreeing with amoxicillin in the past. After the first dose even it helped her SO MUCH. She’s on day 2 (dose #2) & acts as if she doesn’t have an ear infection, running around acting completely normal & nighttime definitely isn’t as rough as it was. One happy mama here!! She was given 250/5ML. The flavor/smell of it is outrageously good, which is a plus having a toddler take it. :)",Slc99

After taking this I am much better than I have been yet. Although the infection is not fully gone, it is less than it was.

8,Cefdinir,Otitis Media,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 5, 2021",1,"First time on this medication. I usually take amoxicillin, but the stomach pain and my other meds can interfere with it so I was given 300 mg capsules to take twice daily for 7 days. It cleared up the infection fine, but I am coughing so hard its knocking the wind out of me and causing chest pain. Not to mention that with covid around, coughing my lungs out at school isn't ideal. Haven't had any other side effects, or if I have, its been overshadowed by my second covid shot side effects. I'd rather the stomach ache to this, honestly.",Chronic Ear Infection

I’m allergic to amoxicillin so cefdinir was prescribed to cure my ear infection. I can’t begin to explain the horror with this medication. I had awful chest, back, and arm pains, I had this pain when I would breathe in the back of my throat that was almost similar to how it feels with my asthma attacks, I had ringing in my ears, awful anxiety(which really sucks because I was finally doing better with my panic attacks), fatigue, and stomach burning.

On  day 6- My heart fluttered uncomfortably along with horrible stomach pain. I went into urgent care. My ALT liver enzymes were elevated. This stuff is harsh on the body. I discontinued use that day and   Drank lots of water. I began to feel slightly better. Possibly due to allowing my body to flush it out of its system. I do not like this drug.,Anonymous
15,Cefdinir,Otitis Media,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 8, 2019",18,"I should have reviewed this terrible medication cefdinir months ago. I know I will never take this medication again. I have never had any reaction to any other antibiotics before. Healthy 50 year old.  I tend to resist new medications just because of reading side affects. I did not check this prior to taking. I was prescribed this for an ear infection. I did not research this medication before because I thought it must have only happened to me, but now my grandson was prescribed this as well and I needed to see if anyone else had my experience. Too many reviews with similar experiences. I was able to take it nine days until excessive diarrhea, vomiting profusely,  temperature, and abdominal cramps. Four days clear liquids, 5 days of the BRAT (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast) diet, 2 trips to the ER. Bottom line, destroys the good bacteria inside you and the bad bacteria takes over. Intense stomach pain lasted 14 days. I hope review this helps someone before they start taking it. Stick  with the basic antibiotics.",Keemo

This medication caused my stools to look like coffee grounds? (internal bleeding) and also diarrhea that just ""leaked out"".  I also was coughing more and my asthma was worse!
