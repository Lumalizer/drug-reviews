0,Cefuroxime,Otitis Media,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2021",0,"I was given this for an ear infection in both my ears & I must be in the minority here looking at all the reviews, but I had an awful experience. The first thing that happened was right after I took them, it have awful burps reminiscent of the way a brand new plastic tote box smells, truly like acidic plastic was all I could think to describe it. Then after a few doses I started becoming reaaalllllly really nauseas, like painful  nausea. I got very lightheaded & literally just leaned up against my bed from the floor & either passed out like that or whimpered like a baby most of last night. I’m allergic to penicillin, vancomycin, & had a reaction to IV Levaquin, but always did well with Keflex & Cipro, so we thought I’d be fine. I’m scared to finish the course of antibiotics honestly, I guess I just had a bad reaction. But what I did take helped my ear infection so I’m still giving it some stars for effect.",Bekkah
1,Cefuroxime,Otitis Media,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 2, 2020",3,Ceftin (cefuroxime):On day 7 and ears still plugged. Sinus & throat involvement continues also. Not pleased with results.,Sassafras
2,Cefuroxime,Otitis Media,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 7, 2018",20,"Cefuroxime has been a very good antibiotic for me. It has cleared up multiple infections (ear and sinus). I have not had any side effects with it, unless I drank alcohol (feeling better after being on med for a week) in which case this would give me an upset stomach. Some antibiotics have given me an upset stomach within a day even though I take with food and take probiotics. I always feel better within a few days with this drug and have no issues. I just hope this review helps someone out there who has had issues with sinus or ear infections because I know how much it sucks and how scary it can be to be unable to find an antibiotic that works well!",lys
3,Cefuroxime,Otitis Media,6,,"October 31, 2016",12,"I had the worst and most painful experience of my freakin life having a double ear infection. I went to my local urgent care and the doctor prescribed Amoxicillin, &this made it SO MUCH WORSE. After 8 days of the amoxicillin, I was hysterically crying from the pain. So I went back to urgent care and saw a different doctor, he prescribed me Cefuroxime & some ear drops. I am on day 4 of this antibiotic and the pain is nothing like it was before, but I am still feeling it. Frankly, I've had a broken nose, too many sinus infections to count, etc. and NOTHING compares to the severity of the pain that this ear infection caused me. I am still in pain but just not as much. THE BEST ADVICE I CAN GIVE is a warm compress or ice pack to help with pain.",merrrr
