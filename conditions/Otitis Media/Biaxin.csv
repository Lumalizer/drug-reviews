2,Biaxin,Otitis Media,10.0,,"March 24, 2016",18,I was put on Biaxin because of an inner ear infection. I'm on my fourth day of taking this medication. Sure there were some side effects but it worked. I couldn't hear out of my left ear for almost 3 weeks and on day four of taking this med I'm seeing results. The results outweigh the side  effects that's for sure.  I didn't think anything would work so I'm very pleased that Biaxin did!,Harley1225
3,Biaxin,Otitis Media,3.0,,"February 5, 2010",16,"I was put on Biaxin 3 days ago for sinus infection, bronchitis, ear infection and upper respiratory tract infection, and have the most horrible taste in my mouth. The 1st night I got up several times just to brush my teeth to get rid of the taste. I called the Doctor today and he is calling in something else. ",dmarispe
