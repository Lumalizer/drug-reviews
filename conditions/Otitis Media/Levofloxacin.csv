0,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 23, 2021",0,"I have taken this medicine several times. It's been prescribed for URTI, Pneumonia, ear infection, and sinus infections. I was first prescribed this when I was on dialysis and it solved the problem with no side effects. The last time I was prescribed this medication it was for pneumonia, the dose was 750mg, one pill daily. The only problem I've had is a bad aftertaste. This medication, like all others, is going to have different effects on different people.",JMOHO
1,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 27, 2021",0,"I will never take this medication ever again. Took one dosage before bed and woke the next morning feeling like I was hit by a bus. Everything hurt, throat was swelling and hard to swallow. I was so scared that I was not going to make it. Called DR. they told me to stop taking immediately and go to hospital. They end up switching to a different antibiotic and I am doing much better. Please be careful on this product. Maybe it will be great for you but have someone you know, monitor you just incase.",Babygirl46342
2,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 5, 2021",2,"Not that long ago I had an ear infection in my right ear and the doctors prescribed me an antibiotic it didn’t work much and I got an ear infection on my left ear they then gave me this antibiotic and it was stronger than the past one, if you don’t know how painful ear infection are they feel like something is stabbing your ears with a knife, right now I’m recovering from it I still get sudden pains but it worked for the most part, this antibiotic is recommended for adults and I’m under the age of 18 so I’m pretty sure I had a major infection",Emma

4,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,6.0,,"October 22, 2020",4,"I’m on Day 5 and so far, no side effects.  Very seldom do I get side effects from drugs prescribed.  I’ve had recurring ear infections for several months now in conjunction with drops it seems to be getting better.  I did make an appointment with an ENT to get to the root of the issue.  But I’ve not yet had an issue with this antibiotic.",Cinluhu

6,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,1.0,,"June 29, 2020",3,"I am a stickler for checking what doctors prescribe. I was prescribed this drug yesterday in the hospital for a middle ear infection but told the doctor that I would get the prescription outside. (This always give me an opportunity to check what was prescribed). Having looked at the above comments I would never use this drug in a month of Sundays. I really don't trust Doctors and always see them as snake oil salesmen with white coats. I was diagnosed and had suffered from COPD, Asthma, and Chronic Bronchitis with the frequent accompanying chest infections. That is why drugs like Amoxicillin no longer work for me. I, however, solved that problem several years ago and no longer have any symptoms with breathing or chest infections. I take liposomal Vitamin C every day which I make myself at home. I would recommend it to all who come on here. I only got this infection because I ran out of the ingredients",Sumarianson
7,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 27, 2020",4,"I got this med levofloxacin for a sinus infection and ear infection. 10 pills  and the dose is 1 pill a day which is 500 mg. My sinus infection feels better, so does my ear. About day 5, I got the worst sore muscles in my upper back, shoulders, and sides of cheeks, down my neck. It's like my muscles are on fire. It's like I tore muscles, so weird. I'm going to finish this med since I have 2 pills left but this is a sucky side effect. Overall, kicked out the infections. I took this with a 6 day of prednisone as well. Less upset stomach with this antibiotic which is a pro. I feel like I got hit by a bus.",Anonymous
8,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 25, 2019",10,"I have been sick for many years. So many doctors would prescribe me antibiotics for lung infection, sinus and ear infection and nothing would help. I honestly feared that these  infections would end me as they would never completely heal up. Finally, an infectious disease doctor prescribed levofloxacin for me and it cleared up! Zero side affects. I have had smaller infections since then and the doctors try to give me another drug for them, after 3 rounds of the other drugs they give me this and it clears up. This antibiotic is amazing.",Too young too sick
9,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,10.0,,"October 14, 2019",0,Took levofloxacin a few years ago for pneumonia and I had zero side affects. Taking now for a double ear infection that didn’t respond to two other more common antibiotics. On day one so hoping it helps this time too.,Karen
10,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 5, 2019",10,"I took 1 levofloxacin 500 mg pill. Got very disoriented and dizzy. It only lasted a few hours, but then the tingling and pins and needles came. It lasted all night, and has spread all over my body, starting with my extremities. The second day I developed leg weakness and the tingling and pins are worse. I read the symptoms could get worse even after the med is stopped, before you get better, if you even get better. This has poison system and I only hope the damage doesn’t get any worse and I start to recover. Don’t take it!!! Whatever your infection is, it isn’t worth permanent nerve damage!!!!",Amylee75
11,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 10, 2019",9,"Levofloxacin was a godsend for me. A severe upper respiratory tract infection and accompanying ear infection sent me to urgent care 5 times before getting this prescription. My ear infection persisted through a Z-pack, amoxicillin, cefdinir and a ceftriaxone shot. The levofloxacin has restored my hearing and eliminated the infection. Did not experience any of the side effects known to occur with taking this drug. Wishing they had prescribed this to me earlier!",Bev
12,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 17, 2019",7,"30 yrs old. I decided to wait before writing this, I took 1 pill 500 mg Dec 31 and within a few hours I felt it my joints were stiff, I was getting tingling and numbness all over my body. My tongue went kinda numb I couldn't swallow my saliva. I ended up in the emergency room. They told me to stop taking which I wasn't  planning on taking anymore, its been 3 weeks and I still feel muscle spasm,numbness and the tingling, the occasional joint pain. I feel fortunate that is not as bad as it was the first few days when I could barely walk. Stay away from this medication I wished I would have followed my gut and everyone's advice. I hope with time I can return to my old self. You never know how your body will react to the medication, there a lot of other medications that although still have side effects, they do not stay with you like this horrible medication does. Its not worth it - it can change your life for a long time maybe even permanently. ASK FOR AN ALTERNATIVE.",Cachanilla
13,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 30, 2018",11,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):8 years ago I Was prescribed levaquin for ear and sinus infection.

14,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 6, 2018",5,"I skimmed over the reviews and found that most people had horror stories.  I have had it prescribed twice, within a few months, for different reasons.  This drug has helped my upper respiratory infection in January and ear infection this month. It did not leave me with any terrible side effect like being tired, having bad taste in mouth,  getting an upset stomach or diarrhea, or too big to swallow.  Wonderful drug.  If there was only one thing to complain about it would be cost.  Mine would have cost about $122 had it not been for insurance.",Karen
15,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,,,"September 29, 2017",5,"Do not mix this medication with others.  This is a powerful antibiotic and should only be taken if you've been extremely thorough with your doctor regarding the side effects and risks.  I took this to treat a bilateral ear infection, sinus infection, and bronchitis.  Due to the spread of the infection and the fact that I have had dozens of ear infections I'm willing to take the risks because if left untreated, my next ear infection could very well leave me deaf.  This antibiotic was used after I had a round of amoxicillin that didn't do the job and we were getting desperate.  It's been my third dose now and I feel great.  I'm a little ""off"" but will only take this for a week due to the strength of the antibiotic.",Derrick rose
16,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,1.0,,"August 21, 2017",11,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):I took 3 doses of levaquin and stopped it. I now have joint pain, constant tendonitis and vision problems.  I hold Drs accountable for all of the damage done by this class of drug. For God's sake levaquin is used to treat anthrax infections, it should NOT be used for ear infections, UTIs or sinus infections. It should only be used if the other option is death. I'm serious, if you have a life threatening infection, use it because you have nothing to lose from it but otherwise never take it.",Todd Z
17,Levofloxacin,Otitis Media,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 15, 2017",4,"The first time I used it I ended up at a orthopedic surgeon's office thinking I somehow tore my rotator cuff and needed surgery, NOT thinking the antibiotics I had taken weeks prior to this horrible pain was a side effect. Fast forward, 10 months prescribed this antibiotic again and still have ""tennis elbow pain"" on the same arm I had the shoulder pain in. I linked this pain,  IT WAS LEVOFLOXACIN!! It wasn't anything I did it was this awful drug that I took for 15 days. In 15 days this drug destroyed my arm! I have damaged fingernails, muscle pains, and I still cannot grasp and hang onto objects. My dominant arm has been ruined, all because I had 2 ear infections.",BShanyn
