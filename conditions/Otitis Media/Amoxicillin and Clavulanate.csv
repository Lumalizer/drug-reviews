I had horrible migraines starting on day 2 and ending 48 hr after finishing the full 2 x d, 10 day prescription. My ear infection actually got worse while on this and I spiked a fever on day 8. I was really hoping this would have helped and maybe for some it does however, for me I would prefer to never take this again.

Took the first 9 doses with food and probiotics. Sinuses and ears are better (right ear is not 100% yet). After dose 9 I started having indigestion pains. These pains lasted from 8 pm to 4 am (consistent with info about the drug’s half-life). I couldn’t sleep, had to stay sitting up. It was not fun. I did not take any the next day. I’ve called my doctor about switching to plain old amoxicillin.",Nikki

It cleared up my ear infection however I had diarrhea for most of the 4 days I was taking it. It was a constant diarrhea too and a few times it just happened, I wasn’t able to control it.  I took with a probiotic each day. I felt nauseous each day and each time I took it. I also felt very out of sorts mentally and felt like I struggled doing my job and felt anxiety. The day I didn’t take it during work I felt much better and back to normal. I dropped after five days and do not intend to take again. This was a terrible experience.",CommanderShep

5,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Otitis Media,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 19, 2021",1,Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):Never again. Actually I have taken this before no problems. This time different story! Not sure why they gave me such a high dose. Dr told me to wait a few days before starting to see if ear pain cleared as my ear really wasn’t inflamed. I did just though but then figured I would just take it. I got 5 doses in me before the stomach pain started. Now I also have weird tingling and leg pains. So I dumped them! Hopefully my side effects resolve as quickly as they came. I also am starting to get a yeast infection!,Sweetchks

8,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Otitis Media,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 19, 2020",13,"I took Augmentin 875mg twice a day for a really bad ear infection. It worked very quickly to resolve the inner ear pain from the infection after 24 hours or 3 doses. Yes, it made me very nauseas because I forgot to eat food with it but once I took some Zofran-ODT 8mg along with some food, I felt no more nausea. Also, highly recommend taking a probiotic to prevent intestinal issues (read: diarrhea and gas). I have taken Augmentin in the past for a sinus infection and it worked very well then too. I am sorry that some people did not gain relief from Augmentin but I hope these individuals were able to see their physicians to get a different antibiotic for their infection that worked better for them.",Fwbwritergirl

12,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Otitis Media,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 7, 2019",22,I see a lot of reviews here regarding GI upset with amoxicillin and clavulanate . My way of avoiding GI upset is to simply take a complete digestive enzyme before each meal and only take my antibiotics on a full stomach not before or in the middle of my meal. I also take a probiotic between doses of antibiotics. Hope this helps someone out there,Wildman
13,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate,Otitis Media,2.0,,"February 12, 2019",7,"Augmentin (amoxicillin / clavulanate):First, let me start by saying that I don't really do well with antibiotics. I was diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2005 (positive blood test), and I've had autoimmune issues ever since. For some reason antibiotics tend to make me feel really bad, but there are times when I'm left with no choice but to take them. So...I was diagnosed last week with a severe ear infection. Ruptured eardrum, draining ear. Anyway, I had to take an antibiotic and this was the one prescribed. I was prescribed this at 1000mg/2 times per day. First and second day I felt a little run down, but attributed it to the infection. Pretty much the same with the third and fourth day, but a little more intense. By the 5th and 6th day I literally felt like I was losing my mind. Felt super weak, anxious, and panic attacks galore! Today was my 8th day on the medication and I literally almost called 911 tonight! My heart was beating so fast, legs were super weak, head was spinning...just felt horrific!",ANicole
