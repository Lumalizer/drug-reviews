0,Cephalexin,Otitis Media,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2022",0,"Keflex (cephalexin):I have allergies to a lot of antibiotics and the ones I can take I have horrible side effects. Keflex is the only one I'm not allergic to and NO bad side effects. It WORKS. I had sinus infection with ear infection and even though it isn't typically used for sinus infections, always clears it up. Also had a double ear infection. All better. Recommended to those sensitive to meds.",Darling
