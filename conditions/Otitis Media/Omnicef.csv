0,Omnicef,Otitis Media,6.0,,"June 13, 2015",8,"My daughter has had over 6 ear infections, only being 22 months old. She took amox for all of them but it just didn't work. Dr gave her cefdinir (however it's spelt), and I'm pretty sure it hasn't worked.... Gives her red diarrhea, and horrible diaper rash, and she itches that area quite a bit.... She's getting tubes put in next week so hopefully that ends this horror!!",Mandi67

2,Omnicef,Otitis Media,5.0,,"November 7, 2011",15,"My son has taken this before and it worked fine.  My 17 month old daughter was just prescribed this after amoxicillin didn't take care of her ear infection.  After 4 days, her gums swelled up really bad, became bright red and then started bleeding on the 5 day. She also developed diarrhea.  I immediately took her back and they put her on Zithromax.  I think we are finally on something that will work for her.  My son can take this medication, but my daughter can't.",Anonymous

I've had an ear infection myself and I was sick for 2 weeks before I went to the doctor. Thought I had a bad cold but when it just wouldn't go away found I had fluid build up in my ear. They prescribed Omnicef and it worked. I didn't have any diarrhea even though I already have severe IBS! I'd definitely recommend it.",Jennilynne82
