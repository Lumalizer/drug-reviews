0,Zithromax,Otitis Media,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 14, 2015",29,"Woke up due to severe vertigo. Diagnosis of Otitis Media (at 43? Haven't had an ear infection since I was 13). Doctor prescribed a Z-Pak (Azithromycin 500mg Day 1, 250mg days 2-5). The vertigo decreased by Day 3, but never completely subsided.2nd morning after finishing the Z-pak, the vertigo was back in full force, and my ear started to ache. Azithromycin didn't kill the infection.",Anonymous

The physician prescribed liquid Zithromax that had to be given once per day and only for five days and did not need to be refrigerated which was great since we were traveling and best of all it got rid of the croup and the sinus infection very fast - it's a winner.",Anonymous
