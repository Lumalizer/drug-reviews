0,Ampicillin,Otitis Media,,,"May 9, 2008",14,"I have found ampicillin to be fantastic at clearing up any infections, particularly ear infections. Growing up in Canada, doctors would prescribe ampicillin for me and it always worked. Living in the UK now for 25 years and suffering from swimmers ear as well as a serious ear infection for the past 7 years and I find it impossible to convince a doctor to do a swab ear test and even more impossible to get any type of penicillin.",SherryLee
