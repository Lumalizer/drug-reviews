0,Levaquin,Otitis Media,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 30, 2018",11,"8 years ago I Was prescribed levaquin for ear and sinus infection.  Took first and only levaquin pill in evening.  Next morning had violent diarrhea and vomiting.  Got stool sample was brought to my primary care doctors office.  Had already lost 11 lbs.  was prescribed something for ulcers.  I could not eat or drink, but continued to vomit and diarrhea of blood and tissue. Said I should continue the levaquin.   I did not.Called My brother in law, a gastroenterologist across the country he advised I probably had c-diff.  I had flagyl in house, he said start taking  immediately.  C-diff can kill in about  7 days.  I started the flagyl.   Stopped v & d.  By Monday, day 4, my doctor called profusely apologized.  Lab said I have c-diff.  I will live with the c-dif damage and toxicity from that 1 pill for the rest of my life.",Ljw
1,Levaquin,Otitis Media,1.0,,"August 21, 2017",11,"I took 3 doses of levaquin and stopped it. I now have joint pain, constant tendonitis and vision problems.  I hold Drs accountable for all of the damage done by this class of drug. For God's sake levaquin is used to treat anthrax infections, it should NOT be used for ear infections, UTIs or sinus infections. It should only be used if the other option is death. I'm serious, if you have a life threatening infection, use it because you have nothing to lose from it but otherwise never take it.",Todd Z
2,Levaquin,Otitis Media,5.0,,"August 28, 2009",12,"I just finished a 10 day dose for a severe ear infection. After the second dose I began to experience extreme anxiety attacks, sleepless nights, total confusion, and thought I was losing my mind. I have had Xanax prescribed to relieve the anxiety attacks and I am hopeful that the attacks will stop now that I'm done with the Levaquin. ",massphotog
