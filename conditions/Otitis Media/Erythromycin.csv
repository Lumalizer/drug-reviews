0,Erythromycin,Otitis Media,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 11, 2021",2,"This year, I had been prescribed this awful Erythromycin 500mg X2, 4 times a day by one of my horrible GPs which almost left me hospitalized!  I went back to said GP to tell him of the side effects I was experiencing from this drug, he yelled at me to carry on with the course.  The next day, I was admitted to A&E for emergency surgery with suspected 'Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis' caused by these antibiotics, the most serious of gallbladder diseases.  I was thinking of suing the surgery.  Left surgery and please avoid this medicine!  If you feel when you are taking these tablets you are dying, you probably are!",AnnaNimos
1,Erythromycin,Otitis Media,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 8, 2012",24,"I'm taking this due to ear and sinus infection and swollen lymph nodes. I'm allergic to penicillin, so doctor gave me these. Seems to be working on infection, but slowly. I have to take 500mg 2xs a day. It gives me terrible stomach cramps and pain, but after I eat, the pain goes away. I'm just very lazy, tired and my brain is cloudy. Don't feel myself. Not sure if its due to my illness or the medicine. Drinks a lot of water. Hope you feel better!",Anonymous
