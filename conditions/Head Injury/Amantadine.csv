2,Amantadine,Head Injury,5,,"February 13, 2016",18,Didn't realize why I had uncontrollable impulse to gamble my $ away seriously it was bad. I just read all the side effects of this drug I am slowly getting off it now.  I am broke and my head injury induced tremors go on without it or maybe they won't return.  My message is  be careful of impulse control!,Mcandrews
