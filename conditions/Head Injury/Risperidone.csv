1,Risperidone,Head Injury,4,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 29, 2020",5,"I was hit in the head and then smoked weed afterwards. After that I couldn’t even drive I just went to sleep. Time passed and I find myself having psychosis, superhuman behavior. Needless to say I was taken to the hospital after it persisted about three days. That was five years ago. Today I’m doing good on risperadol but I don’t know what would happen if I went off it. I think I was misdiagnosed as a head injury can have some of the same effects as schizophrenia form or affective. The marijuana did not help as I do not know how strong it was.",Jj
2,Risperidone,Head Injury,1,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 2, 2018",4,"My nephew was on risperidone beginning about 8 years after his head injury. On it he displayed catatonic behavior at times and frequently verbalized ""word salad"" and also had explosive behaviors and confusion.After getting off this medication, he was much more in tune to the world and no longer displayed either of these behavior. He was tried on another anti-psychotic and he totally flipped out not knowing where he was. I think putting  Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients on anti-psychotics is a nightmare. With my nephew, it has been proven for us that definitely, the fewer medications, the better. After being on 6 medications for a number of years, he is now only on an anti-seizure and a mild SSRI and is quick in his responses and his memory is improving a lot.",Auntie Em
3,Risperidone,Head Injury,2,,"September 13, 2011",16,"It was prescribed for my son who was hurt from being struck by lightning. He is severely mentally handicapped & confined to a wheelchair. I asked for something that would help him control his temper and yelling & screaming, as it was becoming a problem. He responded well for about 3 weeks then progressively became almost catatonic. I weaned him off of this & he now has Tardive Dyskinesia, after stopping risperidone. all he can do now is drool. He isnt even able to eat solid food anymore. Doctors cannot tell me if this is permanent or temporary. My son had only taken risperidone for 4 months tops",Anonymous
4,Risperidone,Head Injury,10,,"October 17, 2009",32,"Risperdal (risperidone):Had very strange experiences after a car accident, my mind couldn't do maths any more (I used to get 99% for this subject) and found extreme difficulty in ordering/ processing/ structuring things/ information etc. After taking Risperdal my mind seems almost back to new again. Side effects I've experienced include thirst, reduced ejaculation...but worth the side effects...life would be very difficult without risperidone.",Oompah-Loompah
