0,Zyloprim,Gout,9,,"August 10, 2008",142,This medication has been very very effective. I was almost debilitated with gout attacks and continued use of indomethecin. It only has one bad side effect for me and that is excessive sweating. Sometimes I will have hot coffee for breakfast and have to change my shirt afterwards. At times in public it is embarrassing. But it's a lot better than having a gout attack.,Anonymous
