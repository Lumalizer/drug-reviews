1,Allopurinol,Gout,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 12, 2021",17,"I was on Allopurinol for 3 weeks and I never felt worse in my life. This drug turned toe pain into severe joint pain in both my feet and hands. I had a headache, my entire body felt weak and I couldn’t stay awake. Allopurinol made me disabled & I lost my job. I was not able to walk or get out of bed. My doctor prescribed me more and more pain killers to help me tolerate a drug that my body wouldn’t. I skipped 1 dose of Allopurinol for 1 day and I felt completely back to my normal self. I stopped all the prescription drugs and It was like coming out of a fog. My toe hurts a little but I’m working on my diet, taking supplements  to help get rid of the uric acid  and I have never felt better. Praise god!",Joe

Couldn't walk during attacks with excruciating pain.  Finally decided to take allopurinol 200mg daily as recommended by my doctor. Quit alcohol, red meat, HFCS containing foods/drinks, and drastically reduced sugar intake.  During the first 18 months I continued to get severe attacks that only prednisone could relieve. After almost 2 years, my uric acid has gone down to 5.3 and have not gotten a severe attack in the last 6 months! It took a while but I had faith and continued taking my allopurinol even if it seemed like it wasn't working. FINALLY, I am enjoying being free from gout attacks and much happier! Allopurinol works.

I started getting severe pain in my finger joints and what I now know is tophi. I had high uric acid levels when I got tested a year earlier, so concluded I have gout. Online, I read research papers that explained the mechanism of uric acid saturation and formation of uric acid crystals that cause goutStarted taking Allopurinol at 100mg and over several weeks increased to 500mg/day. I know that I will still have joint pain in the short term as uric acid crystals dissolve in the short term. My uric acid levels are down to 6mg/ml as read on the my home tester. Plan on reducing meds gradually in a couple of years once the tophi has gone... To date, no side effects and no loss of sex drive",Colsie

Then followed intermittent gout attacks every 2 or 3 years. I had to get it sorted after a really bad attack where I couldn't even get out of bed and going up and down stairs was traumatic. Prescribed 2x100mg Allupurinol and Omeprazole. This after having a go with Colchocine which I rejected graphically. Allupurinol is a true wonder drug, I've never been on medication before so I can only tell you it does exactly what it says on the tin.

I can't walk or sleep for the pain.  How could they sell a cure that causes the disease?  I read it does make it worse at the start while body is getting rid of uric acid and the Doctor should only start it when the gout is clear or they should give something to treat the gout at the same time as you start.  Once it starts working it should be great.  They say the trick is to start at a low dose, get your uric acid levels checked and increase the dose slowly til your uric acid levels are good.",wreak

Finally went to a GP, who tested my uric acid (9.3), and prescribed me 100mg allopurinol.  Upon reading these reviews, I made an appointment with a rheumatologist, who agreed with the diagnosis and dose, but also prescribed a months worth of predisone and colchicine (since allopurinol will most likely cause a gout attack after starting). Glad I did that, as I had very few side affects for the first month.  Re-tested uric acid, down to 8.1.  Currently upped to 200mg a day, w/o the prednisone or colchicine.  No side effects yet.

I finally started allopurinol per my doctor. 100mg at first then 200mg. At first I got more attacks for about a month. But then they subsided and I've been attack free since. God send. No side affects but maybe some dry skin. If you are suffering with this try this drug. It could save your sanity it did mine.

I was a heavy beer drinker though. Last year my left wrist and thumb swoll to the size of a red grotesque boxing glove. No pain medication could touch it. Imagine bone fracture pain with no relief.

However, my one beef is that sometimes the pills will suddenly stop working and I have to buy a new batch. I am guessing this is because of humidity changes or temperature changes, but it is annoying. For example, about half the times I fly somewhere I find on my arrival that the pills stop working; I carry the pills in my pocket or in my carry-on while in the plane, but even so, they stop functioning.
