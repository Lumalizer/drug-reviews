0,Eylea,Diabetic Retinopathy,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 20, 2021",1,"I have had a Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion for over 3 years now, starting early 2018.  I started out with Avastin with so so results and silicon floaters in my eye that will not go away.  By the end of 2018, I was switched to Eylea with much better results.  Recently, my insurance has denied the use of Eylea and was forced back to Avastin for one injection while they get the insurance worked out.  The Avastin started wearing off at about 3-1/2 weeks.  My most recent injection was with Eylea and I was at 5 weeks and I have not noticed the degradation.  I am happy with the Eylea, except for the cost.  Now that my insurance won't cover it, the Eylea company is working with my Doctor to provide ""free"" medicine.  However, that even comes at a cost as the Doctor now is forced to push more people to Eylea but he is not willing to do that unless absolutely necessary as the case for my eye.",MrP
