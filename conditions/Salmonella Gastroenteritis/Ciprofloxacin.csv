2,Ciprofloxacin,Salmonella Gastroenteritis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 24, 2020",6,"27 year old female. I was prescribed this drug ciprofloxacin yesterday and took my first dose this morning. After one pill I had muscle pain and weakness, pain and popping of my tendons in my feet, ankles, hands, and shoulders. Neuropathic symptoms, trouble walking, and panic started almost immediately. I am just hoping that this goes away. I’m so glad I only took one pill. I would not recommend this to ANYONE. I have never in my life had a bad reaction to any drug until Cipro. Currently afraid to get out of bed due to my popping tendons and the anxiety I have wondering if I’ll be able to walk normally again or if this is permanent. 0/10 Please please please take something else.",Nickname
3,Ciprofloxacin,Salmonella Gastroenteritis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2019",9,"Cipro (ciprofloxacin):22yr old female, got prescribed Cipro for stomach flu symptoms without testing what the cause actually was.  Had pretty bad side effects- nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, chills, couldn't sleep at night. Ended up going to the ER because I got dehydrated and couldn't stop throwing up :( Wouldn't recommend unless you get tested and it's the only alternative.",Penny
4,Ciprofloxacin,Salmonella Gastroenteritis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 13, 2018",9,"Cipro (ciprofloxacin):FDA warns that Cipro should ONLY be taken as a last resort antibiotic for  acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, acute uncomplicated cystitis,acute sinusitis and only if patients know the high risk of permanent injury from tendon ruptures, especially of the Achilles heel or thumb tendons!  Read the FDA advisory (black box warning under professional info for cipro and other fluoroquinolones. You have to be careful because unaware doctors prescribe them for lots of other reasons as a first course antibiotic.   Visit the FDA website and check it out!  Luckily, I knew of the high danger of Cipro when an ER doc prescribed Cipro for salmonella and I asked him for another antibiotic. ",Catherine
5,Ciprofloxacin,Salmonella Gastroenteritis,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 9, 2018",3,"I was diagnosed with Salmonella poisoning on Tuesday. Been sick for 8 days now. Had severe nausea, diarrhea and stomach cramps.The first time I took Cipro it was ok, good enough to eat chicken noodle soup. The next morning I wasn’t able to eat (wasn’t able to eat whatsoever) so I pushed myself to eat 4 crackers and a ton of water to at least have something in my system and it made me EXTREMELY nauseous. Cipro makes me very drowsy so I was able to eventually ease the nausea and fall asleep for two hours, after that, felt fine. I also take Zofran (I have a fear of puking and being nauseous) to help ease my nausea along with Xanax for my anxiety. It is safe to mix these as there are no interactions, unless allergic. Just took my third one and I am extremely bloated. Can not get comfortable. Not sure if it’s related to my period or the cipro, either way it’s a very uncomfortable but tolerable feeling. Hoping the 4th pill I’ll be ok enough to at least eat two meals a day.",Jena B
