0,Cipro,Salmonella Gastroenteritis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2019",9,"22yr old female, got prescribed Cipro for stomach flu symptoms without testing what the cause actually was.  Had pretty bad side effects- nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, chills, couldn't sleep at night. Ended up going to the ER because I got dehydrated and couldn't stop throwing up :( Wouldn't recommend unless you get tested and it's the only alternative.",Penny

Read the FDA advisory (black box warning under professional info for cipro and other fluoroquinolones. You have to be careful because unaware doctors prescribe them for lots of other reasons as a first course antibiotic.   Visit the FDA website and check it out!  Luckily, I knew of the high danger of Cipro when an ER doc prescribed Cipro for salmonella and I asked him for another antibiotic. ",Catherine
