0,Valacyclovir,CMV Prophylaxis,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 14, 2017",9,"Valtrex (valacyclovir):I am immune-compromised from ME/CFS for 17 years. This drug at a dose of 1500 mg/day restored my cognitive clarity to 100%.  At only 1000 mg/day my cognitive clarity fell off substantially...a 20 point IQ drop, perhaps.  When my MD took away my Valtrex one time because she thought my kidneys were at risk after I had white cells in a urine test, I became pseudo-demented and had to use a three-wheeled walker without Valtrex!  I also have vestibular migraine that is treated with 350 mg/day of topamax  and it gets worse without the Valtrex. As soon as I went back on the Valtrex, I perked up immediately and didn't need the walker.",Seizethecarp
1,Valacyclovir,CMV Prophylaxis,7,,"August 4, 2011",3,"Valtrex (valacyclovir):I am currently on 4 mg of Medrol daily for approximately 1 year and a half for what doctors thought was inflammatory arthritis.  Wrong.  I contracted chicken pox at the age of 50 yes I never had the chicken pox as a child.  Advice, if you are one of the unlucky few that did not have chicken pox as a child.  Run to your doctor and demand the vaccine.  I contracted chicken pox while on cortisone - not good.  I ended up in the hospital with a crashed thyroid, mild adrenal crisis.  And most likely cytomegalovirus infection.",sidepockets
