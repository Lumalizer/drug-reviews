1,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 6, 2022",0,I am on clonazepam 0.5mg twice a day with lyrica twice a day. I am still trying to find a doctor to test and swab for hsv12 and Vzv.Neurologist that gave my rxs does not do it.  Have an appointment with ear nose and throat and dermatologist. Any suggestion near west palm beach Florida. A dental school wouldn’t even return my calls.,Maggie g

3,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,8.0,,"July 20, 2021",15,"Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) over 10 months. It started after COVID which probably just exasperated it as I did have occasional bouts before that. Went to PC doc, ENT, gastro doc, and 3 dentists all stating they’d never heard of it. Finally found an Oral pathology doctor who treats BMS. This is my first day of treatment so I can’t really say how well it’s working. I do feel hopeful as he said he will tweak medications until he gets it right. I am on Salagen (for dry mouth) and Klonopin wafer for pain/sleep. My suggestion is don’t waste your money on multiple doctors but rather find a good dental school with good doctors and make sure at least one is experienced in treating BMS which is horrible chronic pain. It typically effects post menopausal women but there are others also suffering!  My prayers for you all.",Nina
4,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 9, 2021",36,I have suffered with Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) for almost a year.  Tried everything.  Nothing helped.  Took several months to convince my MD and DDS that it was not fungal related.  Stumbled on this article and asked my MD if I could try clonazepam and she agreed.  I take 1/4 mg every 4 hrs by allowing to dissolve and holding in my mouth and then swallowing.   Relief is truly incredible.  Went from a 9 or 10 on bad days to a 1 or 2.   Has it cured my BMS?  No.  Does it make it tolerable? Yes. So glad I found this web page.,ssgolf
5,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,6.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 16, 2021",25,"I have had burning mouth syndrome (BMS) for 28 years and I have been to every Dr imaginable.  For over a year, most Dr's thought I was crazy, as they knew nothing about it, until I found an older Dr in dental research. He told me back then about Klonepin. I was so excited, as it did help. Then, I took 1 mg tablet, 3 x's a day. That brought my pain level down to about a 2. For the last 10 years, I have been taking only .5mg 3 x's a day and my BM is getting worse. I have a wonderful Dr & m physical is next month. I'm going to ask her if I can go back to the 3mg daily. I'm 72 and have lived with this so long. I'm glad I found this website, just to know others are suffering with this too. Does anyone use ""liquid Klonepin/Clonazepam""? Just curious, as I've never heard of that.",Suzanne

7,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,6.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 5, 2021",4,"Withdrawal from clonazepam was the worst and lasted over 5 years with burning mouth, stinging raw tongue feeling and deep cracks in tongue after stopping. That is if you can get past the first month off of it. After many searches and asking doctors with getting no answer I had given up and accepted this is life now off the meds and I have to live in pain for ever. GOOD NEWS!!! The feeling in my mouth has went away and hasn't returned in over 2 weeks. I believe it was due to me homebrewing a german hefewiezen with large amounts of yeast in suspension while consuming it green or fresh. Too bad there isn't a study on this because I am sure I wasn't the only one to suffer after stopping this medication.",Nick Name
8,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 6, 2020",24,"Once I found this site, I was willing to try anything as dealing with this issue and no one was helping as they never heard of it, I went to  dentist, allergist, and dermatologist.  Lucky for me I had both of the top 2 medications recommended.  I started taking them both at 9am, 2pm and 11pm within 2 day my pain was 75% better, and 1 week later it was 90% better.  I just hope this continues to help",wifey
9,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,8.0,,"September 17, 2020",23,"I’ve had burning mouth syndrome now for over a year. I’d had other weird mouth symptoms just prior to getting it  that I’d attributed to my steroid inhalers. One day I cooked an egg in a new saucepan - and my mouth suddenly went numb and  I had  an intense burning sensation.  An oral surgeon  diagnosed burning mouth syndrome (but he didn’t know what caused  my other mouth symptoms) . He told me to gargle  Paxam 2 (Clonazepam 2mg) twice a day to settle down the nerves in my face. I have found that the medication has been a great relief to me..  The added bonus is that it helps me sleep! An interesting thing I discovered about a possible cause of burning mouth syndrome  could be an ingredient in some toothpastes, mouthwashes and  gums. Some people are allergic to an ingredient in them - a fake cinnamon (cinnamaldehyde) that can cause mouth sores, burning etc.",Wildrose
10,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,3.0,,"March 28, 2020",18,"I was perfectly normal until March of 2019 when I had a  molar tooth prepped for a crown to replace a PFM crown that was 25 years old. I then had to have a root canal on the tooth, which is when all my symptoms began. Severe plastic/metallic taste in my mouth with severe burning tongue sensation. After that I went through a series of attempts to have the final crown made and placed, and with each attempt, my symptoms became worse until I almost went into shock from a severe allergic reaction. I found this site and my doctor was kind enough to prescribe dissolving clonazepam tablets, but they have cherry flavoring, which cannot have. At this time I am using a plain tablet dissolved in water and swishing in my mouth, hoping that this will finally give me some relief from this torment of metallic taste and burning mouth. Hoping this will work somehow.",Flowerchild

I stumbled on this website, and during a routine checkup asked my Dr. If I could try clonazepam.  I was a bit surprised he agreed given the current climate for these types of drugs. He said because of my anxiety he could justify it.  0.5mg once daily had an IMMEDIATE effect.  A slight dryness and tingle remains, but pain is almost completely vanished. So thankful for a new lease on life; I was about to end it.",Reliefatlast
12,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 15, 2019",20,I was on  klonopin for 20 years and my Dr took me off because I was on Adderall too. So my burning mouth came on within a month. It's very hard to lead a quality life. My primary doc put me back on for another year then told me I was quitting it too - cold turkey. It has been the worst years of my life.With the opioid crisis I cannot be on klonopin and Norco at the same time. After being on both for over twenty years and didn't have any trouble why do I think I would suddenly now. Anyway burning tongue is ruining my life...,Layne
13,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,8.0,,"June 25, 2019",73,"I have suffered with BMS (burning mouth syndrome) for over forty (40) years, without a cure, perhaps induced by toothpastes, meant to treat tooth sensitivity.  Most practitioners I visited had no idea of what it was nor how to treat it, but, please, bear with me.There, this past December (2018), my dermatologist prescribed Clonazepam tablets, dissolved in the mouth for three minutes, then spit, three times daily, as already mentioned on another thread.  ADDITIONALLY, 1-2drops of Tabasco Sauce (YES! Tabasco Sauce - CAPSAICIN) in four table spoons.  Swish and spit.  Increase the number of drops of Tabasco in the same amount of water slowly as tolerated (one drop at a time).  I now use 12 drops in a cup of water, kept in a flask, just like the neighborhood alky.By now, 6-24-2019, the improvement is hard to believe.  Almost miraculous, folks.  And soooooo grateful to my dermatologist at the Mayo Clinic.Cheers! Enjoy life, do good deeds, share your blessings and read all you can, especially classical literature. Hopefully this will help cure your burning mouth syndrome.",Anonymous
14,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,10.0,,"November 7, 2018",42,After being on clonazepam for years for GAD. With panic attacks. I had to find a new Dr because my Dr retired because of health reasons. Trying to get a new Dr to prescribe my script is almost impossible. Now that I have been off the clonazepam I have been having problems with BMS which at first thought was a sinus infection. That went away with antibiotics. But know I'm stuck with the BMS terrible! But with all the new black box warnings. Trying to get a Dr to prescribe clonazepam is ridiculous and I've always taken just as prescribed and went through all the other medications the Drs ordered with no relief. I understand the new laws but am so tired of knowing what work's for me and trying to get a Dr to prescribe it for me. Why Drs can't stand up for their patients and not be so afraid to prescribe a drug that works is beyond me!,Tammy Moulton
15,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 8, 2018",31,"After suffering with POTS (Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ) and then all sorts of neuropathies (Burning Mouth Syndrome being the most troublesome), I can actually say that for the first time in 4.5 years, I feel semi-human again! I was taking  1/2 a Xanax  0.5 mg up to 5x a day with some effect but it was 'snowing' me terribly. I still had to rinse my mouth with oral Lidocaine just to be able to speak! After the very first dose of the liquid Clonazepam, I immediately noticed a marked improvement in my symptoms! It took my pain down from a constant 7-9 to a 2-3. I can live with that! I am so, so thrilled to have a doctor who actually listened and cared enough to not write me off!",ROAMER
16,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 30, 2018",54,Have had Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) for 2 years. Took two ENT doctors to get a diagnosis. I was suicidal. Finally doctor 3 said he didn’t know what to do but had read about clonazapam. He had to go back an re read dosage. On it for a week and can’t believe the change. Not perfect but darn close. So happy and will be optimistic about a future. So sad doctors don’t understand the pain this causes. One told me I should be happy it wasn’t cancer and just get over it. So sad.,Mollyduck
17,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 19, 2018",9,"I have suffered Burning Mouth Syndrome for almost seven years now. I tried Clonazepam (Paxam) 4 years ago (slowly crossing over from Xanax) but it didn't help. I had seen an oral pathologist who suggested this.Today, I asked my GP for another prescription of Clonazepam (Rivotril, this time) as this thing is causing me to resort to taking more painkillers etc. I have taken one dose of .25mg this evening and am to take this twice per day, increasing to .5mg if necessary.My GP is not keen as I take 1mg Xanax twice per day and have done so for about 24 years (and it still works, contrary to what the benzo haters say). My attempt to get off it using a Valium taper was a year of hell. I got down to 1mg Valium but life was terrible so I quit.Fingers crossed. Can't bear to think I have this for life. Along with Fibromyalgia. Life is difficult.I just read the long list of side effects. A bit scary!",Izzy

19,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 2, 2016",51,"After suffering with burning mouth syndrome for over a year, my doctor said that he had had good luck with one other patient using orally disintegrating clonazepam. I quickly got his Rx for it. It dissolves easily on my tongue (no bad taste) and I take it twice a day, 12 hours apart. After about 10 days I can say than I am ecstatic that my burning mouth syndrome seems to have disappeared. I have a little left over mouth pain but that I can attribute to my upper denture. I don't know if this will work for everyone, but I certainly think it's worth a try if you can tolerate it. My only side effects were a little dizziness for a couple of days (didn't drive), then daytime drowsiness. I don't work, so this posed no problem for me. hurray!",JBB7951

22,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,8.0,,"March 8, 2016",44,"Was in pure agony 24/7 with BMS for about 2 1/2 months.  Tried 'magic mouthwash', but it only lasts an hour and was supposed to be used every 4 hours, so I went through the bottle in no time.  Went through a bottle of Chloraseptic every 4-5 days.  Took extra vitamins, went on Alpha Lipoic Acid, tried everything I could find suggested online.  Then finally asked my doctor for clonazapam.  I could tell when the first pill dissolved in my mouth it was going to help.  Now I'm just trying to get the dosage right.  BMS  is about 80% better.  I get 1 mg up to 3 times a day.  I can easily take all 3 just to sleep at night.  Should I ask for a higher dosage? Taking them this way leaves me with nothing for the daytime, and nothing for anxiety.",bms trouble
23,Clonazepam,Burning Mouth Syndrome,5.0,,"December 23, 2015",63,"Hi there everyone. I have suffered from BMS for almost 9 months. 2 Doctors and a naturopath could not diagnose me, but I diagnosed myself after reading many articles and posts. I also went to my GP and asked him to prescribe Clonazepam. He had never heard of it's use (for this) and I was the first ever in his surgery who complained of such a problem. Anyway, luckily I got in to see an Oral Surgeon only today. He confirmed I have BMS and prescribed .5mg Clonazepam to start with. It seems we who suffer have a trigger point event which has initiated stress and anxiety in our brains, causing the pathways to be blocked and not causing our nerve endings to work properly. I will check in again in a few weeks and let you know, but do see your GP",LGMus
