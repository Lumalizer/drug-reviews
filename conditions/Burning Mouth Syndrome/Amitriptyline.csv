2,Amitriptyline,Burning Mouth Syndrome,1,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 1, 2020",7,"My Gi doctor prescribed this drug amitriptyline, for burning mouth and other symptoms - poor sleep, loose bowels.  It immediately helped me sleep, and I took it without much problem for a year, although my Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) over this period got slowly worse.When I tried to wean off of it, lo and behold, my mouth felt so moist and my burning mouth improved immediately.  Unfortunately it created havoc in my stomach with acid rebound,  and I had to go back on it to wean off very slowly.  Apparently amitriptyline can also CAUSE burning mouth.  Taking this drug was one of the worst decisions of my life.",Bijay
3,Amitriptyline,Burning Mouth Syndrome,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 17, 2019",1,"I have tried Amitriptyline  50mg nightly for three weeks, not helping. In addition to that am taking Zinc and rinsing with oregano oil.",burningtongue3
4,Amitriptyline,Burning Mouth Syndrome,5,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 27, 2017",29,"I have suffered from Burning Mouth Syndrome now for 7 years; it literally possessed my mouth like a fiery demon one day, and I have suffered on and off from it ever since.  After trying numerous ineffective treatments, I was prescribed Amitriptyline (Endep 25) by an oral pathologist. It works to a point, and also helps with the chronic insomnia I have experienced for 10 years.  However, I don't like taking this drug; I feel like a zombie the next day and it takes a whole day to get over the feeling.  However, I like to keep a supply on hand for when the BMS becomes unbearable; I'll actually 'knock myself out' with Endep to obtain relief when my symptoms are really severe. More research needed urgently into this nightmarish condition!",SandyKatz

7,Amitriptyline,Burning Mouth Syndrome,8,,"December 8, 2008",164,"Elavil (amitriptyline):I was very sceptical that an anti-depressant would help with my persistent burning mouth syndrome. My symptoms were severe, burning tongue, roof of the mouth, and throat. After many tests and no results, my doctor suggested amitriptyline. It worked almost immediately, and after two weeks, almost all the pain is gone.The side effects are minimal, dry mouth and disturbed dreams which seem to have diminished after a month or so. It's worth it for me.",Anonymous
