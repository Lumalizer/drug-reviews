6,Codeine,Pain,9.0,,"November 30, 2019",21,"I *need* Codeine for the pain of Fibromyalgia and take 8 codeine phosphate daily. But I'm going to be tapered off due to the addition epidemic. It's unfair on genuine patients  that some abuse it, which put changes to guidelines on prescriptions. Just cos some go on their crusades to change laws puts pressure on others.",Dexy

8,Codeine,Pain,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 29, 2018",29,"I am 20 years old. I have been suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder for 4 years. For me, the biggest problem of the wide range related to chronic anxiety is chronic pain: huge muscle cramps in shoulders and neck, as well as back pain, bruxism during day and night and frequent headaches. Codeine 30 mg every 6 hours helps me level all of these issues so that I am able to study my University subjects. It has been the only painkiller that helped me so far... I am lucky to have an understanding doctor, given how  much are demonizing this helpful medication, due to some irresponsible people.",PainPatient97

10,Codeine,Pain,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 10, 2017",17,"I have been taking codeine 15yrs+ with diazepam & Tylenol. I can no longer take anti-inflammatories too, unfortunately. I have a huge tolerance, regularly taking 240-300mg a day (8-10 tablets). On pain free days I need to take a 1 tablet about every 12hrs or withdrawal starts after about 18. That is a bit like having a dose of flu for a few days, combined with severe diarrhoea in my case. During rare pain-free periods it isn't worth weaning myself off completely cos the pain is never away long.Everyone different; 60mg gives me 2 hrs max. relief. No constipation, dizziness or nausea-the latter often experienced briefly on 1st use (inc. posters here) -dose probs too big. Constipation is common & worse than the pain, I'm told, so go easy.",Eadwig
11,Codeine,Pain,,,"July 5, 2017",17,After hurting my back I was sent home with some Endone which did not relieve my pain. The hospital gave me some Asprin/Codiene dissovable tablets. It was like a warm feeling of relaxation and pain was gone. My back healed within one week and I stopped taking them afterwards. I highly recommend this to someone with spinal pain.,Mr S
12,Codeine,Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 22, 2016",27,"I am an early 60's male with chronic neck pain as result of too many skiing accidents over many years. Normal pain killers like Aspirin or Naprosan wouldn't even touch the pain however l found Paracetamol / Codeine 500mg / 30mg worked wonders. I take 1 tablet at first and if pain too intense increase to 2 tablets. Because of stomach upsets and slight dizziness l limit myself to 4 tablets daily. Talking to my GP about situation and the fact that l did not want to stay long-term on the Paracetamol / Codeine and he suggested acupuncture which l started to have 2 times a week (10 very sharp but small needles) over a period of 6 weeks and, as result l have only had 1 of my tablets for the last fortnight which is a wonderful turn-around for me.",Homestay

15,Codeine,Pain,9.0,,"January 17, 2016",19,Fantastic would be suffering with out! I take co-codamol 30/500 for tooth ache  that I'm getting work on and having to wait a while for referral to go through. But this really does make the pain vanish in about 10 minutes! Only down side is it can make you feel very drowsy and very slight stomach ache but I take to help me sleep as that's when the pain is at it's worst and it does help you sleep. Also causes constipation and the pain free moments only last a few hours.,roseifer

Whenever I took the codeine, my pain level was very low, so I'd say it worked pretty well! The only reason I didn't give a ten, is because it did make me extremely nauseous at one point.",Alyzsa
19,Codeine,Pain,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 28, 2015",24,"lI was lucky to have had a Dr that did research with codeine for Narcolepsy. Codeine has a paradoxil effect in Narcoleptics. It works better than any stimulants to not only be able to stay awake but aware without the awful side effects of a stimulant such as jitteriness. I Am able to read, do paper work, budget money, drive things that require concentration that are otherwise extremely difficult and hard to do and get right.  Codeine has allowed me to be able to do things I wouldn't be able to do anymore on just stimulants. Gives me some life back. Having Narcolepsy is like having to watch life go by in a dream, it steels your ability to participate in life. Slowly built a tolerance otherwise no problems at all.",Sleepstate65

22,Codeine,Pain,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 24, 2013",36,"Had 4 wisdom teeth taken out this morning at 8:30am. My dentist prescribed some codeine for the pain. Having never taken codeine before, and the label reading take 1 or 2 pills for pain, I decided to take 2 around 12:30pm. WOW, these things take all of the pain away alright, however, for about 1 - 2 hours they made me very drowsy, out of it and I couldn't look at anything with a screen without it being blurry or me feeling dizzy. I was literally glued to my seat. Thought I was going to throw up at one point too.  Should probably only be used for chronic, unbearable pain - otherwise it is not worth the side effects. Still feeling a little woozy now at 10:00pm. Will stick to the softer stuff because it seems like I am really sensitive to it.",Anonymous
23,Codeine,Pain,7.0,,"April 17, 2013",20,Short lived but effective painkiller.   I tend to get more dizzy and lightheaded from it than hydrocodone but the painkilling effects are similar.   I rarely took the recommended dose on the bottle because it affected me so much.  1/2 a pill seemed sufficient.  Takes only about 30 minutes to start taking effect.,Rickee

38,Codeine,Pain,10.0,,"January 28, 2009",64,Very effective. I have osteoarthritis and can be pain free with Codeine. It is more effective with Ibuprofen.  ALSOprofoundly lifts depression due to chronic pain and makes such a better life day to day. Space doses well apart to avoid tolerance. I use only in the morning with very good effect. Using whole daily dose in the morning may get you through the day without a need for a second dose. I would leave at least 6 hours between doses to assure full effect.Don't suffer needlessly. Good luck and hope this helps.,pxbaa
