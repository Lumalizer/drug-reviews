Most days maybe 1 or 2 and if the pain is manageable, I don't use it at all. I'm averaging 60 pills every 4 months.

In each and every one of the mentioned cases, the Vicodin has been the pain management of choice.

I take two Vicodin in the morning (my bedtime, as I work third shift). It takes about an hour to really hit. I take one when I wake up and four and one more when I go back to sleep for three hours at nine. With the two latter doses, my pain isn't completely gone, but the edge is dulled. I can deal with it.

The drug also allowed me to maintain or improve mentally in order to function in a demanding job. This is separate than the pain relief. Another interesting side effect is an increase in libido at least for males. The combination of Vicodin and Viagra worked great for me to achieve erection.
