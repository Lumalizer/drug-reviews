Maybe this was better when a prescription was required as it cost me $11.49 for a 50 g tube. Each application for knees or the lower body is 4.5 inch long ribbon or 4 g. Which means this tube at the recommended applications, 4, per day will last you three days. Some things that you should take into account also is if you have high blood pressure or kidney disease, then you really shouldn’t be taking this stuff.
