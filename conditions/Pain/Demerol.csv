2,Demerol,Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 28, 2021",0,I was driving to the airport morning when intense pain creeped up on my blank stomach area. Kept getting worse to the point I had to pull over next thing I know I was in fetal position next to a phone booth. Somehow I was able to gather strength and drive a couple blocks to the nearest hospital. I checked in trying to remain calm but I remember having to go to the bathroom and then there I collapsed at once again in a fetal position because of indescribable pain. They finally called my name and I sat in the back room waiting and waiting moaning and moaning the people to my cot were pleading with doctors to help me. I think the doctors thought I was faking for drugs. I remember throwing up the pain was so intense. It felt like I was in another realm the pain was so relentless. I never made sounds like that before. After what I thought was an eternity a doctor assistant shot me 75 mg of Demerol. The Bliss was unbelievable I'll never forget how it took the pain away miraculously I thought.,Pain gone mad

About 1984 my dr. give me the 50 mg. Meperidine tabs. I controlled my migraines by using  half a pill when needed. Most times a months prescription lasted me four to six months. I never got dizzy or anything when taking it. I did use phenagen for nausea. I am allergic to morphine, codeine, imatrex and a variety of other meds including antibiotic s. Allergies occurred in hospitals. My neurologist has no problem prescribing it for me but I can't find any place to fill it so for six months I have had to put up with horrible headaches. VA pharmacy has it but my neurologist isn't in the Optum system for prescription, only medical part, so they won't fill it. The latest VA give me, Topamax. It don't help, it only messes my INR up for my warfarin. Even my PA has stated I don't abuse drugs.  But she can't prescribe it and the dr. won't. Demeral is only pain med I have not had reaction to.

10,Demerol,Pain,10.0,,"February 13, 2020",8,"I also find Demerol to be the most effective pain medicine. I have only been given it in hospital. When I had my surgery in 2009 I asked for Demerol, and the nurse was excited because there was one vial remaining after the phase out. Why can’t doctors, and the medical community understand that people are different? They have found it is not as effective well it is for me! Also, if someone has used it for 10 years, as some have stated, they are not going to develop toxicity. Having said that, when I was reading about the dangers, I recalled visiting my dad in hospital right after they had prepped him for surgery (with Demerol), and him being on all fours on his hospital bed, catheter, hospital gown, IVs and all, talking about the dogs in the trees, and looking crazed! (But delighted) So he may have been in trouble with prolonged use. No matter, I am happy right now because it sounds like it might be back around!

Let the pain stop and let me sleep 4 hrs at a time, easy to step down off of to non prescription pain meds and no addiction.  Used for 2 weeks.   Recently was hospitalized for cellulitis pain that had me unable to put foot to ground, and with a lot of drug allergies the hospitalist asked me what I could take, they weren't impressed and said ""I don't even think we have Advil here"", not that that was working for me anyways, and I said I'd once had Demoral and it seemed to work well.The Hospitalist actually laughed and said ""that old school drug, where the heck you think we'll find that at nowadays?"" They gave me morphine instead, which while it did take away the pain, left me feeling really weird.  I was given another dose 4 hours , and while it did help with the pain, it wasn't as good at it as Demoral had been. It really worked well on abdominal pain from laproscopy surgery, shame its not used anymore.",kchan

14,Demerol,Pain,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 2, 2019",8,I do not know why you hardly see this drug anymore. It has to be the standard for ER's and now most places use morphine or hydromorphine.

Try going to the closest hospital pharmacy. They tend to carry things that other pharmacies do not. They also are able to more order things much easier because as a hospital, they must have these things available for people with allergies, etc. I wish the FDA/DEA would realize how harmful NSAIDs (especially ibuprofen) can be, and that everyone is different. What works for one may have horrible side effects for another. When taken responsibly narcotic analgesics are less harmful to the body, and this is a subject that i have researched extensively.

My new doctor kept me on the MS Contin, but refuses to provide Meperidine. He switched me to Oxymorphone IR 10mg, 1-2 tabs QID as needed.

Takes a few hours to kick in but when it does I usually get the best 10-12 hours of sleep which helps decrease the pain since I can rest and let my muscles be at rest.

61,Demerol,Pain,10.0,,"February 4, 2009",12,Demerol is the only medicine that works for quick relief of pain. I suffer fron chronic pain syndrome. I take 30mg of methadone 4 times a day and then a fentanyl 50 mg patch every 48 hours to control the pain.,jmk198verizon.net
62,Demerol,Pain,10.0,,"January 21, 2009",19,"I was given this drug after my tubal ligation surgery. I had never taken it before or since then. It worked very well. I was able to function on it as well. It didn't knock me out or make me hazy like some pain medicines. Aside from some itching,I didn't have any side effects.",SoFarAway
63,Demerol,Pain,10.0,,"November 8, 2008",34,I have had Demerol twice via injection during ER visits and it worked very well. The first time it took 2 x 100 mg shots to knock out the severe pain caused by the neurotoxin in an Atlantic box jelly fish sting - worst pain I've ever felt! The second time it was a 75mg shot that pretty much dulled a uterus spasm I was having - felt like someone was ripping my insides out. I was given a shot of Vistaril shortly after the Demerol and it greatly enhanced the Demerol's effectiveness. ,Anonymous

In the recovery room i was given 2 shots of Demerol in my IV to help the bladder pain.  Much to my surprise I felt like a human being again because the demerol also  relieved a migraine headache I had for about 10 days.,diamonds53
67,Demerol,Pain,10.0,,"May 6, 2008",64,"After a fall and suffering a slow decline into osteoarthritis of the right hip, I had been managing pain with Vicodin for the last two years before I went for total joint replacement. Maybe I had built up a tolerance because after surgery, my pain was mind-boggling until it vanished ""just like that"". I asked the nurse what she just gave me and she said she tried a little Demerol via I.V. Amazing stuff when morphine didn't do it for me!!",robin56
