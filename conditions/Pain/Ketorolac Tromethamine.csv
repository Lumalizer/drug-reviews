3,Ketorolac Tromethamine,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 12, 2022",0,Toradol (ketorolac):Toradol is useless & causes the most severe constipation imaginable. I have had it by injection 3 different times for 3 different reasons & it did not work for any of them. I will never agree to this medication again. My heart breaks for anyone given this as their only option to severe pain & post op. Shame on doctors. I can’t think of anything this may help. Not even a splinter. It will however keep you busy for days trying to resolve the stomach issues you get as a bonus to your pain that wasn’t resolved.,SoozieQue

5,Ketorolac Tromethamine,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2022",0,"Wow this drug is horrible. They prescribed it to me before the tooth extraction and told me it's like morphine. Little did I know it's a NSAID with blood thinning properties. The exact opposite of something you'd want before/after a tooth extraction. NSAIDs immensely slow down the healing process since inflammation is important for healing. And the blood thinning properties of Ketorolac (Toradol) make it impossible to stop bleeding. Whose bright idea was it to prescribe a blood thinner and anti-inflammatory for a tooth extraction? People are so afraid of opioids these days (tried and true) and its absolutely ridiculous. I've never had any issue with opioid addiction or withdrawals even though I've taken hydromorphone, morphine, tramadol, percocet and oxycodone before in my life for pain. Now it's like every doctor thinks opioids are the devil and they refuse to prescribe them for pain. NSAID isn't good for pain and prolongs the healing process. Doctors are absolutely ridiculous these days.",Michael

Literally one minute in pain, next minute gone. I felt normal again. It was wonderful. I was careful to take it with food and I also took antacids to be safe. I only took when needed as directed, and just for a few days until the root canal.  Coincidentally developed a migraine during this week and tried a Toradol to see if it would knock it away.

For me, I had no pain relief whatsoever -- not immediately nor the next day; Thankfully, no side effects either.  The only thing I noticed was the sensation of a needle in my butt and a brief, very faint metallic taste in my mouth (like I get when saline is injected into an IV).

16,Ketorolac Tromethamine,Pain,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 15, 2021",0,"Toradol (ketorolac):I was suffering chronic neck pain caused by working at a computer at home from sunup to sundown. It became acute and hurt so bad that I had to put my hand behind my head to lower myself into bed, and once my head was on the pillow I couldn't move my head in the slightest without intolerable pain. Rolling onto one side was an indescribable ordeal, having to support my head with my hand behind my neck and making incremental moves until finally repositioned. Yesterday afternoon the doctor gave me a shot in the hip of toradol and last night in bed I was totally pain-free. Toradol in a non-steriod anti- inflammatory drug. It works by stopping inflammation, which in turn reduces swelling. When there is swelling, soft tissues in cramped spaces bind together and hurt. If the pain is caused by something other than inflammation, an anti-inflammatory drug is not likely to help. If it doesn't work for you, it doesn't mean it won't work for the next person. It depends on the ailment.",Painintheneck

It is agonizing and makes each breath painful which is not great for someone having an asthma exacerbation. The ER will only prescribe Toradol which not only does not work but gives me the worst stomach pain and bloating (which they think I’m making up for some reason). So I end up leaving the ER in more pain than when I arrived. It seems to be their go to because they don’t want to prescribe opioids but it just doesn’t work.,Cat

50,Ketorolac Tromethamine,Pain,3.0,,"December 26, 2020",1,This drug is a joke ketorolac 10 milligram mg oral tablets. The only way I feel them is if I'm lucky enough to have a narcotic with them because it is an NSAID and does help reduce inflammation that being said it doesn't touch my broken fingers pain. Per Hospital requirement no pain meds unless broken.. I was hoping it would not be broken since it was I was prescribed ketorolac and morphine immediate-release and I feel great this happened Christmas Eve so I'm only 2 Days In.But when I use the ketorolac during the day without the morphine immediate-release there is no effect so I have to tough it out because they only give you a couple days worth of pain meds and you're done and I'm not looking to get hooked anyways so unfortunately ketorolac is what they're giving you for inflammation.

The burning was far worse than the migraine and I could not keep using this without lidocaine nasal gel or spray. At the time I bought Sprix, I did not have any drug coverage from my health insurance. Shockingly, a 1 month prescription cost me over $500.00 U.S. dollars!! When I asked to be switched to generic oral Toral (Ketorolac) tablets, the same month's supply and dosage cost me about $20.00 U.S. dollars. Oral ketorolac worked equally effectively to the Sprix nasal spray in terms of analgesia, drug onset time, and duration. I have gastroparesis (stomach paralysis), which can delay oral meds from reaching my intestine, but found that the 20-40 minute onset helped.My bottom line is to avoid Sprix nasal spray as it is grossly overpriced and it causes such severe burning pain in the nose that Sprix scares away the migraine.",gorillaarms

The only negative is it can only be used sparingly, as an emergency medication for your worst days, because the most you can get is 5 vials per month. But I would be in an awful place without this.
