0,Xodol,Pain,10,,"November 28, 2020",7,This combination of 300 mg acetaminophen and 10 mg hydrocodone works best to suppress pain from kidney stones while interfering the least with sleeping.  Other Vicodin combinations have odd side effects like itching and sleep skimming (no deep sleep).   This pain reliever works best for me.  Always needs to be taken before pain level becomes too high!,Languano
