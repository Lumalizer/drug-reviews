I could have dealt with the severe cotton mouth (a known common side effect). However, I started having back pain in the first week. By day 17, the back pain (another known common side effect) was so severe that I spent the weekend on the couch alternating between muscle relaxers and opiates. Pregabalin took away my nerve pain, but I still have an awful backache 3 days AFTER I discontinued use of this medication.",J.E.

I gained a massive amount of weight, suffered extreme aphasia, shaking, memory loss and more. It works at the start because it makes you high (precisely the reason they were allegedly using it to replace opioids) The withdrawal was the worst thing I ever experienced. I hallucinated, had depersonalisation, derealisation, restless limbs, insomnia- and it lasted for months. I now have severe chronic facial pain that started when I stopped Lyrica. Note that no scientific studies have been done on withdrawal and long term effects.  Even today specialists dismiss the idea that it is addictive. studies have shown that it’s no more effective than a placebo. Please join the Facebook group called Lyrica Survivors for support.

The Lyrica works for the nerve damage in my legs. It feels like lighting bolts of pains shooting in legs and the Lyrica works on it. I go to get my meds this time and they made me get Pregabalin generic. Upset but thought I have no choice and started taking them. Within the first 3 days I knew they were not working like the Lyrica. The lighting bolts started to come back, I will have to admit they are not quite as bad as they were when I first got the nerve damage now its more like a medium lighting bolt, and once in a while a big one will hit. Kind of like if you had a cord that on the end of it just had 2 wires at the end of it, you plug it in the socket then touch the wire ends to your skin, you then get a big jolt. This is what it feels like when I say lighting bolt pains.  And now what am I suppose to do as they won't pay for the lyrica :-(",Di

The vicious cycle of nausea and testicle pain caused by this medicine forced me to turn to cannabis and discontinue lyrica. I exhausted all other alternatives first.

Side effects include acute cognitive impairment, significant motor control reduction, loss of swift reflex's, inability to concentrate etc etc.Anyone who studied pharmacology knows that benzodiazepene's are far more addictive physically and mentally and the withdrawal can be LETHAL, via seizure and death, as compared to opiods/iates, where it will not kill but the withdrawal will be highly uncomfortable.So lyrica, gabapentin and the other drugs that fall into the category, at least of the way I lay them out as 'gaba-nergic' like, side effect, drugs.These drugs are MORE DANGEROUS THEN OPIODS.

Combined with a good sleep-initiating medicine (i.e. trazodone), pregabalin is an even better lifesaver than alone. Next, pregabalin works quite well for benzodiazepine withdrawals. Lastly, it does work well for depression and anxiety. The downside is that it will dull cognition greatly and can also greatly increase depression at certain doses.

That was years ago and I have since both weaned myself off the drug and restarted taking it again.  One thing I rarely see mentioned is the terrifyingly bad withdrawal effect- missing more than one dose for me throws me into the absolute darkest pits of despair.  Has anyone else experienced this?  When I went off the drug the first time I felt like I had performed a miracle; so strong was the feeling that it took a long time for me to convince myself that things were bad enough to warrant going back on.
