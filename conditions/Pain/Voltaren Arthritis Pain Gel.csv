0,Voltaren Arthritis Pain Gel,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 15, 2022",0,"I did a bit of gardening and by the evening my shoulder and arm was very achy.  I rubbed a small amount of Volterol gel on my shoulder and up my arm.  I didn't think there was any problems until I went and had a bath. I noticed my shoulder and arm had blisters and spots. They were very sore. I washed the affected area and thought perhaps that would help. That night my shoulder and arm were burning. It has now been two weeks, the blisters have got much better but my skin feels so tender. I do not recommend this gel. Or if one decides to use it be very careful.  Not sure how long my skin will get back to normal.  I do hope it will be soon.",Mollie

Had been using Pennsaid but it is difficult to apply to wrist as it is a liquid-gel. Looked this product up online and asked my orthopedic surgeon for a prescription which he agreed. Comes with a little plastic measurement card to apply the right amount. Since I was applying to both wrists I measured out 1/2 dose because it’s better to use less than more. Supposed to apply twice a day, and I only applied the medicine a total of 5 or 6 times.  Woke up this morning and saw both wrists had peeling skin.  Went to the manufacturer’s website for Amneal.  Apparently this is a side effect called exfoliative dermatitis.  It says to discontinue product if you have this or any type of rash. So that was the extent of my use of this product.

I found this out the hard way after ditching ibuprofen and other pain relievers, and my blood loss came back just as severe once I started the gel. And I had to go on nexium and iron supplements. I just did not assume this would be the case since it is a gel, but if you look it up you will see that in fact it can be just as dangerous. It works really well. No doubt. I was using too much of the extra strength to make up for stopping I'll leave and Advil. I think if you use smaller doses in a concentrated area, it would still be better than though is however.
