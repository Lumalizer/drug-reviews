0,Amitriptyline,Pain,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 16, 2022",1,"Have been on Amitrip for about 3 1/2 weeks for whole body nerve pain.  Started with 25mg, didn't do much and went to 50mg.  I sleep great, a little hard to get up but I make sure I go to bed early. Have had some side effects like dry mouth and some sharp headaches.   It has decreased the nerve pain immensely, not totally gone.  It's been worth it.  I am still in the investigative stage of what's causing my nerve pain.    Nerve conductivity and EMG were normal.  Doc thinks it is fibro or a from of MS.  Just glad to have some relief at this point.",ckap12
1,Amitriptyline,Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 25, 2022",1,"Elavil (amitriptyline):I was prescribed this for nerve pain.  It just helped me a little bit with that, but I was amazed that my debilitating panic attacks went away within a couple of weeks.  It also helped my insomnia, which was also very debilitating.  I've had no side effects that I can pinpoint.   I was concerned that it could cause weight gain, but I actually lost a lot of weight because I used to binge on junk food when the insomnia kept me awake all night.  Now I fall asleep and I'm not awake eating.  This is the only medication that ever helped my panic attacks.",moonfire241
2,Amitriptyline,Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 9, 2021",1,"Amitriptyline damn near killed me. My weight increased from 145 to 174lbs. My abdomen swelled like a basketball. The drug made me feel ""spaced-out"" and trapped in a body that I didn't like. It did NOTHING for my failed laminectomy and resulting leg pain. I thought suicide to be the only way out. Doc didn't believe that I had a bad reaction to it. I had sores in my mouth, red blotches on my chest, scalp, breakout on my back. So, at the doc's prodding I took it again...to prove him wrong. I was right. Never a mind-altering drug again. That goes for Paxil too. I am in that select group who only gets effective relief by using narcotics. I have not had a driving violation in 50 years. Think about this. Ten-thousand people die daily from tobacco use (CDC numbers). Yet, when we go to the pharmacy with our narcotic scripts....what do we walk past? Shelves of TOBACCO that requires no prescription, provides NO protection to children who live in a smoker's home.",BOCEPHUS745

4,Amitriptyline,Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 30, 2021",10,"I’ve contemplated suicide due to how bad my back pain was. I am 26 fairly muscly, good healthy weight, but unfortunately I suffer from multi level degenerative disc disease and have 3 bulged discs. The pain was too much. I felt like cutting my wrists. I was in so much pain. I had episodes where my back would spasm and I’d be unable to move for 1-2 weeks, this all happened so quickly. One day I was healthy and living life to the fullest and then suddenly 5 years of agonising pain. I was then put on this medication and I still have the odd ache and pain, but I finally feel normal and happy again. The pain has reduced from 100/10 to 1/10. I would recommend this to anyone.The Amitriptyline hasn’t stopped the back spasms but they are less frequent and do not last as long.",Silimus

7,Amitriptyline,Pain,8.0,,"August 12, 2021",3,Taking 10mg a day - has definitely made a notable difference to the chronic back pain I’ve experienced for many years.   I am able to go for long walks again every second or third day which is amazing.  Side effects at 10mg have been minimal.  I probably need to go to a higher dose to get more benefit - which will be done slowly.   Even at 4 weeks on 10 mg has been awesome.  It has given me hope again that I can live relatively (low level) pain free.,Anonymous
8,Amitriptyline,Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 29, 2021",2,Excellent drug. I had on and off pain from repeated Prostatitis and this drug has allowed me back my quality of life. Prior to taking I had urgency and pain and all the classic prostatitis symptoms. I thought it was due to infections but my consultant told me it was nerves over firing after repeated infections. Amitryptyline has helped me get my life back and taken away 90 percent of my issues. I still get the odd bad day but even those are better than they would’ve been off this medication. Also aids sleep so a win/win. Wonderful medication and I will be happily remain on it for as long as is necessary,AG

Been off of it for 9 weeks and its sheer nightmare. No sleep, achy body, panic attacks etc. This drug is not what it advertised. I mean if it's so safe then why do you have to wean off it so slowly???And, why does everyone feel so awesome when taking it? It is like Xanax to me. Just beware. A  friendly message to others. If you don't want to go through weeks of withdrawal( even after tapering slowly off for 6 months) think twice about this drug and the mess it will leave you in (physically and emotionally).",Honee

13,Amitriptyline,Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 6, 2021",7,So I started taking Amitriptyline for severe back pain after I had an accident. I was taking it for just over a week and started experiencing breathing issues and chest pains. It got so bad I had to call an ambulance. I was told it was nothing to do with the medication so I continued taking it. Now 3 months from then and I still have the breathing issues which keep me up all night and it’s scary sometimes it gets really bad. I’ve stopped taking the medication but I have no idea what I’m meant to do. I don’t know how much longer I can live like this. I will say it helped with my back pain but I’d never take it again because the negative side effects have really changed my life. Please don’t take this medication.,Kay

The next morning I felt groggy, hungover, light headed and generally yuck. Being a slight build (petite) and being very sensitive to any medication! I knew 10mg was too much for me. So the following night I halved the dose (bit one tablet into two). I personally feel this is more manageable to cope with as a starting point.

Withdrawal made me anxious, but the worst was over after only 2 weeks - make sure you plan a good exercise, hydrate, and health eating plan during this 2 week period. Overall, the drug helped and got rid of the headaches, but the daily grogginess made me want to quit.  Slight weight gain of 5-10lbs, but nothing too crazy.
