0,Advil,Pain,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 16, 2021",3,I was on it for about a week taking it once daily for tendonitis. Started getting migraines after several days and ultimately ended up in the emergency room with AFib. Would not recommend.,That person
1,Advil,Pain,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2018",8,Advil works extremely well for toothache.  I was taking prescription Ibuprofen 600 and they don't work as well or as fast as original advil in my opinion.  Starts to work 15-30 mins after taking 3 for me.  This is an infected tooth that needed a root canal or is going to eventually be pulled.  I keep advil in my purse and will discontinue use after I have the procedure. Very pleased at how it stops extreme pain.  A godsend!,Pea
2,Advil,Pain,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 6, 2018",11,Tried using Advil pm due to fibromyalgia pain and wasn't able to sleep. However I probably would have slept better if I didn't take anything because not only did it not help me sleep it failed to take any of the  slightest pain away,Anonymous

4,Advil,Pain,9,,"April 2, 2012",17,"I've been taking Advil (Ibuprofen) since 1999 for headaches and body pains. I sometimes take this with the prescription medication Maxalt (which treats migraines) I've have REALLY bad headaches and migraines since I was in grade school and took Tylenol until when into my late 20's. I then started taking the regular 2 tablet dose, 400 mg. I HAVE on occasion upped the dosage (not on doctors instruction) to 600mg if the 400mg dosage isn't effective and the pain doesn't not subside within 30-45 minutes.",When Dee
5,Advil,Pain,10,,"May 22, 2008",23,I love this product! I was in severe pain until I started taking Advil. Right away I like felt the pain go away - it was like the first time I heard the Beatles. Thank you so much.,freakinnaughty
