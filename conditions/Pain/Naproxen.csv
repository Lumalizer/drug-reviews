Taking one gel capsule right as I start feeling pain seems to get rid of it altogether within about 10mins! I never really trusted that drugs worked well until I used Aleve.

Tried the Tylenol/Advil combo. Barely worked. Couldn't sleep and early morning I grabbed my Aleve to see if that would help... Pain is pretty much gone unless I move that area of the mouth.
