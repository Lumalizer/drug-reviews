0,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 19, 2022",1,I usually suffer from a strange joint pain which is not positive for R.A. When I take the Hydroxyzine it calms the pain down. I also suffer from sharp pains all over my body and that also settles down a bit the medication.,Cece

2,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,8.0,,"August 2, 2021",0,Vistaril when taken with 50mg amitriptyline at bedtime helps a lot. No side effects after 1 week. It did knock me out when I first started taking it. This lasted for 2-3 days. I give it an 8.,smedley
3,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 18, 2021",9,"The drug works well for chronic pelvic pain. I take 50mg at early night, sleep well and wake with less pain.",CPJ
4,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 4, 2020",6,"I use hydroxyzine to treat a comorbidy of conditions. I feel high when I take it though. It is best if I take it at night but my doc says its good to take it if I have symptoms a lot as an allergy med. I have weird thoughts on this drug and I feel drunk and on weird drug kinda feeling. Maybe its the sedative effect. I mean it works for what you take it for but but the negative is that you have to deal with weird thoughts all the time and loopy feelings, I'm not sure I can handle this anymore",Notfun42
5,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 15, 2020",23,"33/Female/Anxiety/Chronic Migraine Cycle for 2.5 years.... I tried every over the counter medication, anti-depressants, anti-seizures & none of these medications rid me of migraines. I was prescribed this hydroxyzine for anxiety & it broke my migraine cycle. This is even after several visits to the E.R. to receive various different migraine cocktails combinations and even ketamine couldn't get rid of my migraines. This med completely eliminated my migraines. I was able to find a neurologist who ordered 200 units of Botox per migraine protocol. After 5 rounds, I am finally migraine free and not on hydroxyzine. I was taking 25mg 3x a day & then 50mg 3x a day. After 3 months, I became sedated but, after the 4 month mark I became confused and couldn't find my car in the parking lot, walked out of the pharmacy almost forgetting to pick up this prescription, couldn't remember what exit to take off the interstate, etc.",Skittle
6,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,7.0,,"August 23, 2019",41,"Could not figure out why the only time my tooth ( and thereby entire jaw ) only stopped hurting at night... I take hydroxyzine and gabapentin together at night for anxiety. No more mystery! The two together should be ALL they prescribe for tooth pain! Why is no one screaming this from the rooftops for people with tooth pain??? Best remedy ever, hands down.",Reba
7,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,7.0,,"January 28, 2019",21,"I had four teeth pulled at the same time. Bad idea. The pain was horrendous. I took hydroxyzine/gabapentin together...this has been my only relief in five damn days of horridly, horrid, horrible mouth and jaw pain. Does NOT work on anxiety for me.",Roxigirrl
8,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 24, 2019",28,25 mg of this drug is literally the only thing that helps my migraines. Takes about half an hour to work and I still am aware of my headache but it makes the pain much more tolerable and eliminates the accompanying nausea. Iâ€™ll take the profound sedation from this over migraine pain any day,Happyhead
9,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,1.0,,"April 28, 2017",12,"Very bad! Do not  use! Gave blisters on palette mouth feels like it is on fire, very miserable does nothing for anxiety or sleep, check out before you use this medication..",vavette
10,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 20, 2016",26,"I have a very high tolerance for meds (all meds) always have, even as a child.  Woke up in the middle of surgery at 7, after give twice the adult dosage bc I couldn't go to sleep.  I noticed on opiates they help but minimally.  I noticed for a brief period when I had benzo's for my anxiety, it aided my pain meds.  But they took me off for another kind and my opiates for pain and anxiety relief weren't being helped at all.  They just switched me and I notice the same aid to my medication the benzo's provided minus the fog.  It doesn't help with my severe chronic pain on its own (I wish it were that easy) but I find that my meds works so much better in conjunction.  My gabipentin seems to work better too. :) finally I can live a little better",meghan1985-222
11,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 24, 2016",19,"Hydroxyzine seems to help more with my reaction to pain than with the actual pain. If I take hydroxyzine while I have shin splints, I still feel quite a bit of pain; it's just that I feel significantly less distressed and distracted by the pain than I normally would be. It works best for pain if taken with an actual painkiller. I prefer using naproxen, as the hydroxyzine seems to counteract the stomachache I always get from this NSAID.",Noice18
12,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,9.0,,"July 19, 2016",40,"Finally a migraine preventative that works for me! I was having up to 10-15 migraines a month. None of the standard migraine preventatives worked well for me, or I had side effects that I could not tolerate. I have 2 levels of migraines -- those that Excedrin Migraine takes care of and the ones that need my triptan (Axert) medicine. Within a week of starting the hydroxyzine, my ""low-level"" migraines all but disappeared and I was down to 3-4 ""triptan"" headaches a month; the month after that the ""triptan"" headaches were gone. I haven't had a migraine-free stretch like that for over 15 years! The side effects have been minimal -- I was drowsy during the day for the first week, but that has gone away. On the plus side, I'm sleeping better too!",scbs
13,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 7, 2016",22,"I've been on this med for 5 days now. MD put me on 50mg along with my Oxycodone 15mg 4x daily for severe pain in my medial scapular region. At 50mg, all I do is sleep. I tried breaking them in half and taking 25mg also. At 25mg, I'm in a fog feeling tired, sad, overall depressed basically. Overall effectiveness of this med for pain... I'd give it a zero!",Fed Up W Pain
14,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,9.0,,"February 28, 2016",46,"I was prescribed hydroxyzine for severe itch. No doctors have a clue why I have these severe itching events. But I also have other problems. I have spinal stenosis and using fentanyl 50mcg/hr every 3 days. Still recovering from colon cancer surgery. Was just diagnosed with arthritis of my hip. There are days I can not walk even with the fentanyl. Started taking hydroxyzine only when I itch and it took a few days to put 2 and 2 together and realized my back and hip almost totally stopped hurting and was able to walk without cane or walker.  Next time that I took hydroxyzine for itch, same thing, I could walk without pain. I haven't told doctor yet, wonder what he will say and if this drug helps me why didn't he give me hydroxyzine sooner?",TDinVT
15,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,8.0,,"July 28, 2015",43,"Vistaril (hydroxyzine):I take Oxycontin 60mg 3x a day, and Roxycodone 15mg 4x a day for chronic back/neck pain. Sometimes I do too much walking, or get severe neck pain that the pain meds don't control. I add one 25mg Vistaril and it enhances my pain meds effectiveness. About 3 to 4 hours later I become EXTREMELY drowsy, and often fall asleep, not good in the middle of afternoon! I think the occasional Ativan is almost as helpful, w/o all the sedation. Good drug, only if I can afford to be asleep.",SPIKEYSmommy
16,Hydroxyzine Pamoate,Pain,,,"January 17, 2015",71,"Hydroxyzine works great mixed with any opioid for anxiety pretty good with withdrawal from benzodiazepines. Works like a charm, if you have this medicine keep it around when needed it could save your life.",Sebastian silva

The surgeon refused to believe that I was in such severe pain after he ""fixed"" me.  Within hours of taking the medication I was in a deep fog.  I could not concentrate or think clearly.
