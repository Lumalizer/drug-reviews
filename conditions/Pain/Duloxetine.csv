4,Duloxetine,Pain,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 21, 2020",25,"I just wanted to share my experience on duloxetine. I was terrified to try this because of the reviews.  I have nerve pain.The first thing I tried was Amitriptyline. I slept really well ,but it didn’t help the pain and I had little energy.Next was Gabapentin. It didn’t help much with the pain and made me agitated. Also I had a huge appetite and started to gain weight.Next was Topamax. I was a total zombie on a low dose.Next was Cymbalta (I take the generic.) I started at 20 mg for 6 weeks. The side effects were mild. I would feel a little nauseous, but only if I went to long without food. It took about 4 weeks to really feel a difference in my pain.After 6 weeks I went up to 30mg. I am so happy with this medication. I feel energetic, but not anxious. I have energy during the day and sleep well at night. I feel a calmness and happiness, but not zombie like. I have been on 30mg for about 6 weeks. I hope it keeps working because my quality of life has been much improved.",Suzz

Soon after, the fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis and pelvic floor pain started and by June I was in a tremendous  amount of pain, anxious and depressed.   I tried Effexor, but it did not give me the relief I had hoped for and it came with it's own set of side effects. Needless  to say I am starting back up on the Duloxetine.

13,Duloxetine,Pain,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 8, 2019",60,"I've been on Duloxetine about 5 years (@ 60 mg/day), and want to encourage people considering trying it not to be scared off by negative reviews. I do believe the negative reviews are (generally) legitimate, and that a lot of people have had negative experiences. Their voices are also critical (as are all patient's) in helping to create awareness. But I believe the experience most people have with duloxetine is not dramatic. It either helps (sometimes a lot; other times just enough to keep taking), or doesn't. It helped significantly in my case, making my pain bearable, allowing mostly-normal day-to-day activities. I did have initial drowsiness (which went away in 10 days - 2 weeks), and nausea (still have occasionally), dizziness & balance issues (still remain, but not major). Don't be afraid to try Duloxetine, it presents a reasonably good chance to provide you with meaningful relief. Best of luck:-)",Bluefish321
