My dose was 100 mg. Once daily. I was so hopeful that it would work out because my pain is so bad. I woke up after the first day of taking this medication and I didn’t feel well. I didn’t put it together with the medicine until I took the second dose. I felt like my stomach was going to pop from bloating with gastric disturbances in my intestines. My head felt weird, more than just a headache. The headache came with a feeling of depression and brain fog. And fatigue? Wow, how could I keep going like this? I was miserable. Taking one more day could do me in. I wasn’t meant to keep taking it. Now I’m disappointed. I really wanted it to work. I’m happy for everyone who has extreme pain and can take this medication. It’s not easy to deal with chronic pain.",tstrom

I will, however, caution anyone with high blood pressure (even if it’s controlled with medication) that they may end up with symptoms of congestive heart failure. My ankles swelled up and I had trouble breathing along with chest tightness and wheezing.

I am in pain every minute of every day, so he put me on Celecoxib 100 mg bid.  I previously tried Cymbalta, but it made me gain 18 pounds in 4months, so I stopped it.  Advil didn’t help my pain either.  The first day on cymbalta  I noticed dizziness, the second day I had dry eyes and slight blurry vision.  I took the medication for a total of 5 days, gaining 5 pounds in water weight.  It took me about 6 months after the Cymbalta to loose 13 pounds of the water weight gain, so I really don’t want to go through this again.
