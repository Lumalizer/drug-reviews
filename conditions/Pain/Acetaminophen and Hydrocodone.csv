Generic Norco for extractions and/or abscessed teeth!!! Jesus, this weak stuff did NOT even give me one iota of pain relief!! WTH, WHY are people having to suffer? Years ago, I'd say 20 years ago was the last time I had an abscessed tooth & was rx'd 5 mg vicodin and it worked great! It gave me so much relief after 2 long days and nights in severe pain. So recently I had another bad abscessed tooth and was rx'd the same, 5 mg hydrocodone. I couldn't believe it, absolutely NOTHING, NO relief at all! I've read others reviews on here so I know it's not just me. You better believe we are being done over when it comes to these medications. Someone told me it's these generic one and the FDA in the U.S. cowers to them, gives them 3 weeks advance notice before showing up to audit their facilities, records/tests on these CRAPPY meds. There is also someone on Ted Talk spilling the beans about these meds! Write the FDA!",Shana
1,Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone,Pain,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 23, 2022",2,I have been getting inferior medication from a company called Mallinckrodt for the last 3-4 years. All the years before that the acetaminophen with hydrocodone medication has worked ok and keeping me out of severe pain and alive. Daily pain is a strain on your heart. Next time I get this inferior medication I will stop paying my part D insurance coverage and look to move out of USA. It is a drastic fix but has to be done that way.,gandy dancer

3,Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone,Pain,2.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 20, 2022",6,"Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone):Seems the physical dimensions of the product has changed with the formula. This med is supposed to be semi synthetic and may be less of the semi (natural opioid) and more of the cheap synthetic now. My same R/x that I have been taking for years, two a day max, fit in the smaller vial whereas 3 years ago they would not fit. They also do not have the same pain relief from that time. My heart disease is getting worse without the pain control. Please be cautious with this med if my suspicion is correct that the formula changed, because that cheap drugs are dangerous stuff. It is a shame how the medical community has changed and doesn't care about seniors who built all of what everyone enjoys today. Be safe policies are changing very fast.",Gandy Dancer

I even took these along with 800 mg of ibuprofen and still no pain relief.

The generics available now are very inferior to the yellow generic and name brand. Us old people are suffering because of someone's mess up and ALL the generics being used should have to have been quality checked and be the same as Norco as we have survived 28 plus years without going to stronger or more meds and would like it to be put back like it was.

I used to take 1/3 of a pill and feel a relief, and now I take almost an entire pill, and I feel like when I used to take the 1/3 of a pill, in terms of relief.

I have also not made any life changes, or habitual changes, and have not started or stopped taking any other medications that would alter the absorption of these.  Seeing other reviews here that echo me, it's nice to see I'm not just imagining this.  We definitely need to make regulators aware of this, as this is something very important.

After about 40 minutes of taking it I noticed a slight difference in my pain level. Within an hour and a half of consumption my pain came back in full force. This would be the peak time for this medication. It is my understanding that this is the time that the medicine would be at it’s strongest and therefore my pain would be non existent. This was not the case. I did however get incredibly sleepy which made the situation worse as I was not able to sleep comfortably with my pain being unmanaged.

Actually the people that legitimately take it for pain are suffering and the people abusing it  have switched to heroin, which there are many more ODs from. Heroin is not controlled so it can contain deadly ingredients; also  an addict could be used to a certain strength and unknowingly buy something stronger that could kill them.

I think  the doctors should get personally involved with the patients; I would gladly answer any questions and give permission for them to check my legal history.

The M brand did not help my pain and made me very irritable. It's as if M put out a placebo or sugar pill. I refuse to take more pills due to the lack of efficacy of the M pills. I learned  independent pharmacies often carry several brands at one time. One near me carries three -- including PAR (the yellow ones!) I hate to sound excited, but I thought they stopped making those and have been suffering through sub-par (pun intended) substitutions. The pharmacist told me Par costs twice as much to order than other brands. My guess is that's because it actually works.
