Buy this & u will be as happy as I am.",Cat
1,Voltaren,Pain,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 14, 2021",1,"Some things you need to consider. Maybe this was better when a prescription was required as it cost me $11.49 for a 50 g tube. Each application for knees or the lower body is 4.5 inch long ribbon or 4 g. Which means this tube at the recommended applications, 4, per day will last you three days. Some things that you should take into account also is if you have high blood pressure or kidney disease, then you really shouldnâ€™t be taking this stuff. Those are two very prominent medical conditions in older people which also happens to be the same people that have the arthritis problems that need the product. So in my case and in my opinion it turns out that Voltaren is not only ridiculously expensive, but useless.",MadMaxx63

3,Voltaren,Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 30, 2020",19,"I got this from the VA right before it was dumped on to the public. It did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for the pain.

Somehow, they seemed to have disappeared.",Eyes of Horus
4,Voltaren,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 30, 2020",15,"Side of foot been hurting for 7-10 days.X-rays negative. Doc said it is tendonitis. ( doesn't know what else it is). He said voltaren should be helpful, reduce the discomfort. I purchased a tube of voltaren for $20. I have now applied it 4 times. Very disappointing. I don't feel anything from it! It is a waste.",Raoul
5,Voltaren,Pain,8.0,,"June 4, 2020",8,The only thing about the product is the size of the tube it comes in . For my knees they suggest a 4 gram dosage. Well if I use 4 grams per knee 4 times a day that's 32 grams a day!  Well it cones in a 50 gram tube. Well common sense tells me I'll only get a not even two day treatment!! Need to look into a larger supply to your customers!! Thanks Hag,Hag

21,Voltaren,Pain,8.0,,"July 18, 2015",30,I have an undiagnosed arthritic condition in my upper back and neck. I've been to a pain specialist that threw strong drugs at me that didn't work. I'm seeing a rheumatologist for a diagnosis (possibly fibromyalgia my GP said) in a couple months but my general practitioner has been treating me til then. I've tried 3 different prescription medications and they did nothing. The second day on this medication I started getting some relief in my back. It's not 100% gone but it really eases my pain. The unfortunate side effect with any nsaid is thin blood resulting in bruising. I have a bleeding autoimmune disorder so it's not the best combo. But I feel like as a first there's promising relief. I hope it continues.,Callysmommy

I couldn't even do simple things like sweep the floor or do laundry. I went and seen my orthopedic surgeon and she put me on Voltaren 75mg and I feel like a new person.
