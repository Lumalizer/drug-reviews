Instead he sent me there while my face, head and jaw was bolted together and wired shut for pain management, what I did not know was that I was walking into a death trap. They  started me out on 40 mg. Which put me on a dose of pain medication higher than all pain medication and stronger than heroin and the worst part is you can't take it as needed you have to take it all at once so your body has no choice but to get used that dose and have to go up and now 12 years later and I still can't get off this drug. It is my worst nightmare and all the people at those clinics do is want you to go up and up it's  the government supplying people with an addiction that you can't get rid of and they are making billions at other people's miseries and laughing to the bank.",Brian Smith

9,Methadone,Pain,8.0,,"March 25, 2017",48,"Methadone can be very useful for some types of chronic pain.  For those who need larger doses of narcotics, methadone does not cause tolerance like morphine or oxycodone so you do not have to keep raising the dose to keep your pain in control.  It does take time to kick in so be patient.  Oxys or MS can be given to help till Methadone kicks in.  Any narcotic can have side effects like constipation.  A good doc will help you PREVENT such problems.  As for comments that kick backs and conspiring with drug companies, we are under intense monitoring as some people sell the drugs to others or overdose and die.  We must see patients often to prevent problems like this.  If not, we loose our license or get sued.  It's called good medical care.",Dr Rick

And those who use it for pain tend to use it like their other prescribed meds. The bad comes mostly from those who use it for substance abuse treatment. Methadone is NOT a treatment of substance abuse, but a tool to aid in the treatment of substance abuse. It does not cure withdrawal, it stops withdrawal symptoms when at a therapeutic level. You will experience withdrawal symptoms when methadone is tapered or discontinued. Those using methadone for substance abuse tend to treat methadone in similar ways as a street drug.

I noticed someone saying that methadone makes them feel tired when they sit.  I know that is a normal side effect but I urge ALL men that are taking ANY narcotic pain medication to get your testosterone checked!  Narcotics lower the level of testoserone and that makes you feel very tired.  I was feeling very tired all the time and didn't really have any get-up-and-go and would have ""Hot Flashes.""  I got my levels checked and my testosterone was almost at female levels.  Now I get testosterone shots and feel much better.  If you are on medicines long term, get your levels checked!",ecellis
