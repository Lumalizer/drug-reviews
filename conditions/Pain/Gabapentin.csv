1,Gabapentin,Pain,3.0,,"March 4, 2022",0,"I have been on gabapentin for 10 years now. and the side effects have changed over the years. I am now dealing with 32 side effects of the long list that I am reading here. The most severe if inability to concentrate and depression. Before I began this medication I was a very creative, assertive, social, confident, go getter! I was in excruciating pain but I was determined to succeed. Since I have been on this drug I have lost interest in my goals and once dreams. I have trouble remembering certain things. I get brain fog. I have been driving turned a corner and did not remember turning. Yes I have constant pounding and ringing in my right ear. My eyes constantly water. I was taking 800mg  3 x daily.I grit my teeth, I cannot sleep more than 3 hours at a time at night. I have severe anxiety, I do not trust people and sometimes think that they are against me in some way. Dry mouth, jerking movements, I count my fingers 12345-54321  as of today I am weaning myself off of this poison!",Maxipoopoo

3,Gabapentin,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 6, 2022",0,So this has been prescribed multiple times in the past for on and off back pain I’ve had for 3 years. I also was prescribed muscle relaxants. The issue with this medication is that it only treats nerve pain and my pain is deeper in the bone than a nerve. I was prescribed 300mg-600mg as needed for pain and it hadn’t done anything. The only positive is that it helps with spasms better than muscle relaxants. I am seeing a new doc this upcoming week who helps with management. I definitely think physical therapy is the way to go but I need a script and a diagnosis that involved physical therapy. The is drug does nothing for me. I’ve had better luck with Tylenol than this.,TNold

I’m screwed now. I’m 61 years old and Ontario has a opioid problem the drs won’t prescribe anything stronger then an aspirin. That’s why everybody buying street drugs to reduce the pain,Frustrated

6,Gabapentin,Pain,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 30, 2021",1,"I have been taking Gabapentin for chronic Groin pain after hernia surgery.Started from 300 mg per day and went to 1200mg per day. on 600mg I started feeling better but my doctor told me that minimal dose for pain is 1800mg. At 1200mg I started having colon bloating and insomnia. I started Googling about Gabapentin and 100% articles confirmed my doctor's words.Then I ran into this article ""Low doses of amitriptyline, pregabalin, and gabapentin are preferred for management of neuropathic pain in India: is there a need for revisiting dosing recommendations?""You only need up to 300mg for chronic pain.

7,Gabapentin,Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 14, 2021",1,"I have a severe herniation and a ""smaller"" one  in my L4. My L3, L4, & L5 are all desiccated( dried out) to 1/2 the normal thickness...the L4 being the worst. I have been on the DRX 9000, a spinal decompression machine. Computerized protocol is figured out by the machine depending on your symptoms and an MRI. You MUST drink a lot of water. The DRX is a computerized form of traction. It pulls and releases at different pounds over a 35 minute treatment. For months I have had excruciating pain especially my right hip, groin and leg! Barely able to walk! The DRX is finally starting to pull fluid back into my discs, I can feel it working and starting to become almost pain free. I have had almost 40 treatments on the machine along with Stim, icepacks and some mild physical therapy. A week ago I was prescribed Gabapentin and within 1 day felt SO MUCH BETTER! It was amazing how quickly it worked!! Ibuprofen was barely helping but the Gabapentin has been Fantastic! I have very few side effect",sciatic pain
8,Gabapentin,Pain,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 4, 2021",1,"Be aware that coming off Gabapentin is a horrific experience. I was prescribed this med post-operative cervical spine surgery, 300 mg 3X day for 6 weeks, and it took 3 weeks to wean off the drug by reducing by 150 mg per day for 3 day intervals before reducing again. It’s hard for me to say how effective Gabapentin was for pain as I was prescribed Oxycodone during the same period, taking it simultaneously. Gabapentin seriously affects your nervous system and getting free of this drug will definitely take it’s toll. Ask your physician about the drug, its side effects, and whether it is really a necessity, and if at all possible, stay away from this drug.",Aaron S.
9,Gabapentin,Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 15, 2021",1,Failed medication for pain due to side effects happening before the dose was high enough dose for pain relief could be reached. I have not ever had pain relief with this medicine. I experience dizziness first. Pfizer was sued for false claims that this drug relieves pain that a it does not. I give it a 0. Have tried it 3 to 4 times. Worse than taking an opiate because it is intolerable Side effects which are dangerous especially for older people. I would not let any so called pain clinic try to talk me into this again.,Anonymous
10,Gabapentin,Pain,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 8, 2021",2,"Prescribed for my husband, a Vietnam veteran with severe back pain. He was on it a couple of years and it worked wonders for his pain. When we saw it on the news as being abused as a street drug, he quit the med at my urging. We were recovering alcoholics and didn't want him to risk becoming addicted. Shortly afterward, he relapsed after a long successful stint of abstinence. He couldn't seem to stop and I tried to detox him at home because we couldn't get in a detox right away.  I started looking on the internet for what I might have on hand to give him and that's when I saw the new findings about Gabapentin and was blown away. I called the VA Ask a Nurse and asked should I give him a little bit of his left over Gabapentin and she said no. They had not yet learned of the med's experimental off label uses.  If we had known this med was helping his sobriety, and  I must add, his attitude as well, we would have have weighed the risks and benefits.  It works really well!",SoberSue

12,Gabapentin,Pain,7.0,,"October 6, 2021",2,"My scoliosis presses on the sciatic nerve and causes debilitating pain. After going along the usual route of exercise, physiotherapy, etc I was prescribed Gabapentin, going up every day by 100 mg. It was difficult to find the best dose for pain relief. There was a very gradual improvement which allowed me to do much more in the day. At present I am taking 800 mg three times a day as any more didn’t seem to make any difference. The pain is more bearable. I would like to go on taking it. The only side effect was an unpredictable digestion, which may be improving with time.",kelleway

15,Gabapentin,Pain,1.0,,"September 13, 2021",1,"I was put on gabapentin for nerve pain caused by spinal stenosis. I was hoping to get relief from the severe pain and avoid epidurals. The gabapentin helped with the pain but but caused my depression to spiral into suicidal thoughts and I stayed in this deep dark place till I finally realized it was the gabapentin. I am slowly decreasing my dosage and I feel better already. My depression is better, I am not planning my suicide, my mind feels clear. I am now on 900mg a day.

20,Gabapentin,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 2, 2021",2,"Was disappointed and surprised by the ridiculously real, vivid, immediate nightmares.  They were terrifying. Got the same from Ambien years ago, doc said they’re night terrors.  Figured that’s a good description for it.  Wide awake type dreams with no logical references or meanings.  Absolutely horrifying. Wake up in tears, sweating and out of breath.  Sometimes taking the rest of the night to get over it.  Last night, almost immediately after falling asleep I had one that was so vivid I wasn’t sure if it was real upon first waking up. Someone stole my car and kidnapped my fiancé .  Came inside to someone playing the piano but then realized I am they only one that plays.  Two men came down the staircase and attacked. The fight was so realistic and so violent it was insane.  I bit both of them terrible, ripping chunks of their face and head off with my teeth and spitting the chunks out. Absolutely bizarre.  Guess I won’t get any relief from my leg pain after all",EncinoMan

Higher dose just at 350mg  twice a day made me feel like a drunk. People thought I was using Heroin. I nodded. I fell asleep standing at ATM machine. So embarrassing. This stuff will make have memory loss. Think you see people who aren't there. It had people thinking I was doing hard street drugs. I wrecked car on this medication,  fell sleep standing in line at grocery story, dropped many drinks out of my hands to even count. This medication is awful and for me  it is not beneficial as the horrifying side effects. They give this stuff out in place of opiates.  People are in rehab for this drug too.

41,Gabapentin,Pain,10.0,,"March 11, 2020",116,I have metastatic breast cancer and I had a spinal tumor that was causing intense wrap around pain in my right rib. I had radiation which helped a lot but I still experience very severe pain in my lower rib. I am only 35 and married with 3 kids and on so much OxyContin and Oxycodone for breakthrough pain that it causes me to feel like a zombie. I asked about gabapentin because my oncologist said it could be pain from damaged nerves from the tumor in my spine. I was started on 300 mg once a day yesterday to see if it works for me (my main goal is being able to take less opiates). It works GREAT! When I was just on opiates for the pain they worked ok but I still couldn't sleep on my right side or even touch my right ribs without severe pain. With the added Gabapentin I can't feel the pain at all and I'm so happy about this. I don't have to use as much of my breakthrough Oxycodone either. Another perk is that it helps with my hot flashes due to medically induced menopause.,Lily

It caused some somnolence but not enough to get over the pain level. They also had me on naloxone/oxycodone which was not strong enough as it cancels itself out in larger doses.

For me, these feelings diminished after a day or so.  I needed to have the dose increased to 3600mg daily to make my pain almost disappear.  Each time the dosage was increased, I felt dopey for a bit, but it was only temporary. The reduction in pain and the good sleep I get is well worth any side effects.  In my case, side effects are minimal.  I have nerve damage resulting from ankle surgery for arthritis.  Before I was put on Neurontin, my outlook on life was pretty bleak.  I couldn't sleep and the pain was excrutiating.  This drug has really helped me.",vviolet

At the same time he was trying to treat me for constant numbness and pain in my leg. He gave me Gabapentin for my leg to see if it would help. Funny enough the leg is the same but the diarrhea rarely happens now. I'm glad this could help that issue at least.",LiL_J
