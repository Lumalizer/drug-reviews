0,Norco,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 29, 2022",1,"Note to Dentists/Oral Surgeons: Please do NOT RX no 5 mg. Generic Norco for extractions and/or abscessed teeth!!! Jesus, this weak stuff did NOT even give me one iota of pain relief!! WTH, WHY are people having to suffer? Years ago, I'd say 20 years ago was the last time I had an abscessed tooth & was rx'd 5 mg vicodin and it worked great! It gave me so much relief after 2 long days and nights in severe pain. So recently I had another bad abscessed tooth and was rx'd the same, 5 mg hydrocodone. I couldn't believe it, absolutely NOTHING, NO relief at all! I've read others reviews on here so I know it's not just me. You better believe we are being done over when it comes to these medications. Someone told me it's these generic one and the FDA in the U.S. cowers to them, gives them 3 weeks advance notice before showing up to audit their facilities, records/tests on these CRAPPY meds. There is also someone on Ted Talk spilling the beans about these meds! Write the FDA!",Shana
1,Norco,Pain,2.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 20, 2022",6,"Seems the physical dimensions of the product has changed with the formula. This med is supposed to be semi synthetic and may be less of the semi (natural opioid) and more of the cheap synthetic now. My same R/x that I have been taking for years, two a day max, fit in the smaller vial whereas 3 years ago they would not fit. They also do not have the same pain relief from that time. My heart disease is getting worse without the pain control. Please be cautious with this med if my suspicion is correct that the formula changed, because that cheap drugs are dangerous stuff. It is a shame how the medical community has changed and doesn't care about seniors who built all of what everyone enjoys today. Be safe policies are changing very fast.",Gandy Dancer
2,Norco,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 17, 2022",3,I was give 6 5/325 and took 2 following a tooth extraction.  They don't work at all. I had a pounding headache associated with the forceful removal of an impacted molar and these didn't relieve the pain enough for me to sleep later that night. I even took these along with 800 mg of ibuprofen and still no pain relief. The sad part is the hydrocodone is such a small percentage that the acetaminophen is the more dangerous of the 2 drugs in these pills,Whole head hurt

Medwatch 3500 form is a simple one page document that will help the FDA open an investigation on the generic manufacturers.  NORCO generic is NOT AB Rated!  Available USA generics are AA rated, meaning they only passed a dissolution test in acetone with a report that has been submitted to the FDA. This does NOT mean it is therapeutically equivalent to the reference brand.That is why you are experiencing more pain, that is because these manufacturers are NOT making therapeuticallyequivalent drugs that you are taking. Again, they are NOT AB Rated.Currently there is no open investigation on generic Norco!

Norco was the best nonaddictive but also effective pain reliever without taking the stronger more expensive oximorphone that was being pushed in pain clinics. The generics available now are very inferior to the yellow generic and name brand. Us old people are suffering because of someone's mess up and ALL the generics being used should have to have been quality checked and be the same as Norco as we have survived 28 plus years without going to stronger or more meds and would like it to be put back like it was.

Possible explanation read ‘manufacturer impurities..’ which got me thinking. 10-325 Norco has allowed me to manage neck & nerve pain for years but lately I experience more days where it’s not working like other days, which I initially attributed to ageing and/or metabolism. Then a couple months ago I managed to knock my entire bottle off the bathroom counter onto a wet floor and toilet… another story in itself. I noticed as I was cleaning up that about half of the pills dissolved almost immediately in water, many even breaking on upon impact. It occurred to me that I have similar experience when taking them, sometimes they wash down my throat like a pill and other times they dissolve halfway down like a ‘tablet’. Now I Google my way to this thread and realize it’s junk meds from Mallinkrodt, and they’re the only thing available thru KP?!",Nerve pain

Peoples money, insurance companies, tax payers money in the trash and people suffering! What a joke the FDA is. Time for a federal lawsuit against the FDA and Mallinckrodt as well as anyone else who stood by while this is going on. This is not the solution to a few bad apples that misuse/abuse their medication. There are much more people who have been using it responsibly and it's not hard to decipher the addicts from the people who want to be able to live their lives without agony and depression from constant pain.

My pain level has continued to increase and my dosage has been increased to 6 a day with minimal relief? It seems doctors stopped asking if you have suicidal thoughts after initial exam. I believe the ones who seek out stronger drugs and overdose are tired of being joked around with by defective generic drugs. I'm not seeking out more pills or stronger drugs, I just don't want to be in pain and think about being in pain and how I'm supposed to live my life.

I don't take the Norco until the pain is a 7 or above. My Norco did fine and some days I could go for 2-3 days without taking anymore depending in my activity level. I have been screaming about these generics that don't work for years. First they took the real flexeril away which worked really well. Now they having taken the Norco away and given us some serious garbage. The sad part is this: us folks that suffer with chronic pain know the truth about these generics. They put us on them and tell us they are fine. People who use the drug to get high are not our problem. There's those of us who truly suffer with chronic pain. And it's sad that our government dies not give two-hoots about our conditions. I can't take those Percocet I'm allergic. They really don't care. The Norco worked.

There has been a supply issue with the inception of the ""Opioid Crisis"". Legitimate Patients are unable to fill their prescriptions.  Mallinckrodt  brand gave me what can be described as flu-like symptoms. Nausea, ringing in my ears, headache, and general malaise.  I checked the ingredients list to see if there was anything I was allergic to in the filler. I see nothing amiss. This is a mystery indeed. NORCO is unavailable at any pharmacy I have inquired to and the preferred generic from Camber Pharmaceuticals is also not available.

I have taken this drug over the years after having oral work done or post operatively, or from the last kidney stone episode 2 years ago and have always had very effective response to it.

Why are State Health Departments sending letters to doctors  treating people with legitimate pain that can be seen and proven from medical testing while they are responsible to guard the medication they take because it is life saving to warn doctors about their prescribing? Doctors will not tell you about those letters. My guess is because pain medications give legitimate people with proven pain quality of life and keep them out of revolving doors in the medical community where salaries are very high.

I was lucky to find one pharmacy that stock amneal, while not quite as good as Watson, Amneal is an improvement over Mallinckrodt (mallincrap) so I won't have to ask my doctor to take me off this medicationwhich I was going to do if only mallincrap was available.

The main problem is finding a doctor to prescribe them. Many doctors mistakenly think by cutting down or stopping writing scripts for Norco, there are less overdoses. Actually the people that legitimately take it for pain are suffering and the people abusing it  have switched to heroin, which there are many more ODs from. Heroin is not controlled so it can contain deadly ingredients; also  an addict could be used to a certain strength and unknowingly buy something stronger that could kill them. This law has caused more deaths, but most doctors haven't done the research I have and don't know this. I think  the doctors should get personally involved with the patients; I would gladly answer any questions and give permission for them to check my legal history. Then hopefully the people in pain would get help and the people abusing drugs could go to rehab to get off it. That's when we'll see a drop in ODs and deaths.",Pain patient

Watson worked best for me, but not as well as the yellow pills. Walgreens just signed a contract with M and that's all they carry now. I can definitively say this past month has been awful. The M brand did not help my pain and made me very irritable. It's as if M put out a placebo or sugar pill. I refuse to take more pills due to the lack of efficacy of the M pills. I learned  independent pharmacies often carry several brands at one time. One near me carries three -- including PAR (the yellow ones!) I hate to sound excited, but I thought they stopped making those and have been suffering through sub-par (pun intended) substitutions. The pharmacist told me Par costs twice as much to order than other brands. My guess is that's because it actually works.

I currently am taking two 7.5mg/325 Norcos 4 times a day with four 5mg Valium that's for my constant muscle spasms and cramps all over my back and legs. At this point I'm seeing my doctor in a week so I can get my strength on Norcos increased or go on to Oxycontin.

Doctor increased dosage to two 7.5 with Tylenol every 4 hours which has worked great.

I was very impressed, it is the first medication that has taken the chronic pain away.  The only other medicine that kept the pain away was Morphine.  I worry about addiction, but I don't have a problem with not taking it if I don't need it.  After five months of no relief from these headaches I am so happy to have found something that works.",Anonymous

I have tried Vicodin, Lortab, Lorcet, Vocoprofen, Vicodin HP and just about every different combination and Norco works the best by far. It relieves my pain in all parts of my body, and is also great for headaches, terrible back pain and abdominal cramping.

189,Norco,Pain,10.0,,"April 2, 2009",72,I was recently put on Norco 10/325 after being on Vicodin since last summer. I had knee surgery which was not successful and now am living in constant pain. My doctor just increased my dosage from 4 to 6 a day. This should provide me with almost 100% relief from the pain. I wish I had an alternative to taking pain medicines. The medicine was scary at first (from the 5 mg Vicodin) but I am now used to them and don't get that fuzzy feeling that made me so scared. Now I know the drugs start to work because the pain goes away! Norco does it's job well and I am grateful to have them.,OldBeforeMyTime
