1,Naprosyn,Pain,10.0,,"March 16, 2014",46,"I had ongoing pain and swelling for a full year after knee surgery to repair three rips in my right knee. It felt like bone rubbing on bone, felt hot to the touch with swelling  After going through narcotics and Motrin for swelling, I worked on accepting that I would be dealing with this for a long time as a chronic condition.  After my 1st dose of 500 mg of Naprosyn, it was a Godsend. For the 1st time in a year, my knee actually felt normal.",kristaphee
2,Naprosyn,Pain,8.0,,"August 11, 2013",26,Had a pain in left knee develop rather quickly. I am 70 and Dr. said was most likely arthritis. Prescribed Naproxyn and it worked very well for that knee. I have a bad right knee also that has been bad for 30 years and is getting worse. I hoped it would too get some relief but it has not. Curious about that. No noticeable side effects.,North coast
