1,Ultram ER,Pain,8.0,,"November 21, 2010",26,"I had surgery for scoliosis with spinal fusion 27 years ago.  Since then, my neck and lower back (without fusion) have been collapsing, curving, and I have been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease.  The pain began to extend to my hips and shoulders and it became impossible to function.  I had difficulty getting up and moving around, and more and more difficulty doing basic daily chores.  (I am a 51 y/o woman with 5 children - no wonder, right? ha ha).  Anyway, my doctor prescribed Ultram ER 100mg for me about 5 years ago and it has given me relief for the most part - until the last year.  I think I need to increase the dosage as I know my back is worse and the pain is getting worse, however, Ultram has been a life saver.",lwrbkpainplus
2,Ultram ER,Pain,1.0,,"May 3, 2010",30,"My doctor prescribed ULTRAM ER 200 for lower back pain and sciatica.  I was taking 1 tablet twice a day.  For 2 or 3 days it seemed to work great.  Then I started having side effects.  I had mild dizziness and a slight upset stomach.  I took Ultram ER for a total of 9 days.  The dizziness became severe, I was lethargic but not able to sleep for more than 2 or 3 hours a night, and the nausea had increased.  I stopped taking ultram ER and it took 12 days for the side effects to subside.  The doctor said I had an allergic reaction to this medication.",autmnrose555
3,Ultram ER,Pain,10.0,,"April 9, 2010",41,"I had an accident at work about 4 years ago which injured my neck and back.  After taking generic tramadol for a couple of years and constantly having to up my dosage I saw a new doctor who switched me to 300 mg Ultram ER, what a difference!  I have been taking it for 2 years now and I can't imagine what I would do without it.",Anonymous
4,Ultram ER,Pain,8.0,,"January 24, 2010",31,"I have peripheral neuropathy that was originally misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia, until I demanded real tests. I've tried Duragesic, Oxycontin, Vicodin, Tylenol with Codeine (developed an allergy to), Lyrica, as well as various other NSAIDS and muscle relaxers. I hated taking narcotics, there is a big family history of drug abuse and it really made me worried that maybe I would start acting like them.  I would say that Ultram ER 300mg plus 2 of the 50mg tabs per day as needed really works well. I do also take 1500mg of gabapentin a day, alprazolam to sleep if needed, and Soma occasionally (maybe 2-3 x/ month). I also use Lidoderm patches and TEDS.  I now can go to college again and don't feel doped up.",Koolie-A
5,Ultram ER,Pain,10.0,,"January 19, 2010",40,"I was in a car accident in April 2009. My doctor put me on Flexeril, hydrocodone, and ibuprofen. The hydrocodone helped me stay functional but he took me off of them. I was very careful with taking them but I guess he thought I didn't need them.  So after that, I found out after talking to others that he should have sent me to an Orthopedic. Well, I got a new doctor who referred me to an awesome Orthopedic doctor. He checked me out and took me off the Flexeril and put me on Tramadol ER. He also referred me to a wonderful physical therapy wellness center. Tramadol  has given me my life back!",Functional Yay!!
6,Ultram ER,Pain,8.0,,"November 28, 2009",26,"I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis 2 years ago. At the same time I was in early recovery for addiction to pain killers (prescribed for pain,if your pain never stops you continue to use as prescribed and you are addicted). I had to have something so my Doctor told me about tramadol. I take 4-6 50 mg a day for pain. No side effects. Don't know how I would have got along without it.",Anonymous
7,Ultram ER,Pain,3.0,,"September 11, 2009",28,"This is an exceptional drug for pain relief but the side effects far outweigh the pain relieving benefits. I took Ultram ER,300 MG for 3 months for low back pain and like I said it was a savior for my pain. However, I started to have some strange dreams with muscle spasms, constipation and extreme fatigue. I stopped the drug about 10 days ago and have finally started to feel better. I am 73 years old and in good health, except for the back pain.",Harrybea
8,Ultram ER,Pain,10.0,,"May 7, 2009",52,I have adhesions related to multiple abdominal surgeries and some nerve damage as well. I was on Vicodin for 6 months and was referred to a pain clinic. Being a nurse I had seen Ultram used in the hospital with good pain control. I suggested I try it and stop the Vicodin. It was an incredibly easy transition and the benefits were immediate.I too have noticed a definite mood stabilizing. I was having mood swings on the Vicodin that were affecting my relationships with others. I feel calmer and my pain is nearly gone at 200mg daily. I am so thankful for having relief. I think it's a wonderful drug.,Nurse Lynn
9,Ultram ER,Pain,8.0,,"January 6, 2009",41,"I am now 19 years old. 2 years out of HIgh School I severely broke my hand from a fight. I have never felt so much pain in my life. I underwent 3 surgeries, 3 plates and 24 screws later my hand was somewhat normal still a lot of pain. Now im getting ready to leave for the United States AirForce and can not take narcotic pain medication. My doctor recommended 200mg Ultram ER. IT WORKS WONDERS and it doesn't show in my drug screening. I never thought I could take one pill a day and be pain free.",dan the man
10,Ultram ER,Pain,8.0,,"December 6, 2008",34,I had spinal fusion in lower lumbar region 9 years ago.  I was fine until August '08.  I had such severe sciatic pain doctor progressively put me on Ultram ER 200mg 1x / day.  It worked great.  Pain went away after 4 months.

11,Ultram ER,Pain,9.0,,"August 4, 2008",26,I have chronic lower lumbar pain from a bone disorder that affects mostly my lower back. Pain can be excruciating at times. I was taking the tramadol 50 mg tablets for a few years they helped some but I had to take more and more of them. My doctor put me on the tramadol ER tablets so I take 1 tablet a day. It is great. With one 300 mg tablet a day I can function fine. It gives great pain relief.,chronic lower back pain
12,Ultram ER,Pain,9.0,,"July 11, 2008",25,"I found tramodol to be very effective in controlling my back pain.  I was able to use the minimum dose for the most part, but knew that I could take another half pill if the pain was more severe, usually in the morning.  As the pain decreased, I did not feel the need to take the medicine as often, and was able to get off of it easily. I could function well while on this drug at the minimum dose.",Anonymous
13,Ultram ER,Pain,9.0,,"March 24, 2008",26,I have suffered from TMJ issues for many years and was prescribed many pain meds but the narcotics made me very ill.  I started taking Ultram ER 200mg and for once I could actually function in the real world!  I recommend anyone needing long-term pain relief to look into Ultram ER,KMU
14,Ultram ER,Pain,9.0,,"March 5, 2008",83,I am a Helicopter pilot for the US Army and I have Chronic upper back pain.  I am on the 200mg Ultram and it is a life savor.  It still allows me to fly and controls the pain.  My only issues with this drug is it tends to make me itch and I can't take it before bed or i will be awake all night.  I have been taking it as needed for the past 6 months.,heloguy1976
15,Ultram ER,Pain,,,"March 3, 2008",31,I had been taking Ultram 50mg for two years and my Doctor decided to take me off of it because i was taking 4 tablets per day. Since then my doctor has put me on other meds which have not helped. I recently read about Ultram ER and I have a doctors appt tommorrow. I am going to mention this to my doctor to try because i think a one a day pill is exactly what I need. I will let you all know how it goes. I pray this works because i am tired of taking pill after pill.,ChiquitaJ
16,Ultram ER,Pain,,,"October 22, 2007",102,"I took generic Tramadol 50 mgs for years and it did not help me. When I heard about Ultram ER 200 mgs I asked my doctor if I could try it and she said ""Yes."" I started taking it and the difference in my pain level was amazing. I ran out of it and in the interim my pain level escalated beyond belief. I will never be without this RX ever again. It keeps my pain at a level that is tolerable. It made a tremendous difference in the quality of my life!",happy to be alive
