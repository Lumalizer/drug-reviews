5,Acetaminophen,Pain,10.0,,"May 22, 2021",1,Tylenol (acetaminophen):The 2021 commercial is very sincere and touching.  I use tylenol and it works well for me.  After see the commercial I feel like the company is in business for more reasons than just the revenue.   It has worked well for me through a variety of medical issues and I will continue to use this product.  Thanks,Bj5551
6,Acetaminophen,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 2, 2021",1,"Tylenol has never worked even a little for me. It seems to be the go-to pain reliever at hospitals and emergency rooms here in Canada, but really does nothing, even when it's Tylenol-3. It has never even got rid a headache for me, let alone real pain.I can't count the number of times it's been prescribed for me following surgery for broken bones (for use after I'm off morphine or other opiates). It might as well be a sugar pill. My sister is the same — it just does nothing. I don't know why they still give this to people as a pain reliever. I always end up buying naproxen or ibuprofen instead.",Saskia58

He told me to take Tylenol Arthritis. Well, it works sometimes, but most of the time it barely touches the pain. If I take aspirin with it, it works better. But I'm still in a lot of pain. I don't like using creams, because I had a cat die from Icy Hot poisoning, so that's not really an option. I need something else.",Yeayeakitty

11,Acetaminophen,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 8, 2019",17,"Tylenol (acetaminophen):It’s one of the most worthless medicines I know of. I have tried Tylenol on numerous occasions throughout my life for migraines, back pain, menstrual cramps, post surgical pain, arthritis pain because some doctor or friend has recommended it. Each time it did absolutely nothing for me. Aspirin is a better pain reliever. Now with severe chronic pain, my Doctor wants me to try it again. No thank you. I give it 1 star because I never suffered any side effects from it.",taper-nightmare

I took 2 pills of the extra strength. After about 15-20 minutes I could breathe without crying, it was still extremely painful to sit, but after another 15 minutes or so 90% of the pain was completely gone. So thankful  for Tylenol extra strength!",B.
13,Acetaminophen,Pain,,,"February 6, 2019",10,"Tylenol Extra Strength (acetaminophen):I had my rotator cuff repaired and I was sent home with a block in my arm that did not even last 24 hours. Also I was sent home with a liquid bulb of pain medicine around my neck with the tubing inserted into my shoulder. In less than 24 hours the tubing leaked twice and finally just fell out. I had one pain medicine prescription. I had to half each one into 4. It was terrible pain and the doctors advised me to take extra strength Tylenol. It does noting for me. I don’t understand why there’s a push to take Tylenol. I’m certain Tylenol would work for me if I exceeded the recommended does. Thus, why so many people have liver damage. Tylenol and extra strength Tylenol is like taking nothing. I even tried going without it and then taking Tylenol. No difference!!!  Nothing!!",Lawgal

I also am very active and sometimes suffer neck and shoulder pain resulting in yet another headache.I have used tylenol for my entire adult life and I cannot even think of what life would've been without it. I have always gotten high fevers with no other symptoms when others get sick. Tylenol has helped me thru all of it. From migraines, to horrible monthly cramps. Crazy when I think about it...It allowed me to function normally through some of the worst moments of life.

It seems to work better than extra strength and longer. I don't need to rely on my oxycodone as much now that I take this for some pain flares. That being said, not every pain flare is the same and I end up still using one of my oxycodone. I'm allowed up to 4 per day, but now I take one or two since I started to use Tylenol 8 hour.
