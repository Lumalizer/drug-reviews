I had been taking increasingly higher doses of Hydrocodone to no avail. I can’t take any type of anti-inflammatory meds due to my DMARDS & Biological meds for my disease. I thought my life was just to endure untold amounts of pain. That’s all until I switched pain management doctors and first heard about Belbuca. At first, I was hesitant because I thought there is no way this is going to work. I’ve completely quit hydrocodone and couldn’t be happier. At first I was still getting the Norco but I tried a little experiment to see if my relief was in my head and only relied on the Norco and couldn’t make it two days and was right back to that familiar place of excruciating pain with little to no relief.",GAME CHANGER!
1,Buprenorphine,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2021",2,Belbuca (buprenorphine):Belbuca is so terrible. It’s got nearly no pain relieving effects and it puts me in a really bad depressed mood. It also takes like 3 hours to even kick in and it also blocks the effects of other opiate medications so you have to wait days for it to clear your system before you can try a different pain medication. Stay away from this junk.,GI

I promise I am not one to exaggerate my pain or complain but this med is not very much help for me at least. The package is difficult to open. It’s thin and you have to be careful when cutting it so that you don’t cut thru the patch.Pharmacies don’t keep much (if any) stock of Belbuca. Be prepared to  wait for the pharmacy to order it. I don’t have a problem with the patch not sticking (thank goodness). I can sense minor relief in about 45-90 mins. And the relief does not last  for 12 hour doses. ...unfortunately. I have broken Harrington rods in my back I’ve been in pain management for the last 23 years.

If not complete withdrawals then pain all day in the sixth day. Got tired of it and changed to the 12 hour film. No matter how hard you try, it sticks to your teeth and takes about an hour to go away. I found it took care of my sciatica but didn't do a thing for stretched nerve pain. It would break through the Belbuca at about 11 am and screaming breakout pain would be with me for 12 hours. So I couldn't tell if it worked at all. Either my breakout pain was a hundred and the Belbuca was a ten, but I could not tell if I was on the medication or not. I hurt every day.",Skeetz

I used the Buprenorphine strips for pain in my arm after I had minor surgery done. At first, the effects were positive. I felt very sleepy and euphoric but also because I had taken it at night. Once I woke up in the morning I started to experience all the side effects that came with it. Shaking, sweating, muscle tightening, itching, vomiting, dizziness, hallucinations, headache, nausea, twitching, dry mouth, hard breathing and heart racing all in 24 hours.

24,Buprenorphine,Pain,1.0,,"November 4, 2019",67,"Butrans (buprenorphine):This is simply and awful drug that is shockingly being misrepresented as a front line pain management drug vs a rehabilitation drug. Dr's are being either scared or bullied into writing scripts for this trash and people like myself with MS, 11 invasive surgeries including multiple cervical fusions, multiple thoracic disc replacements and once of my fusions is broken. Further, in my case it was equitably compared to a fentanyl patch in performance.  It was my pharmacy that actually told me what it was and how it would or more so would work. I had no titration down from 100 Morphine Equivalents and was started on a patch of 7.5mcg. This medicine is so misunderstood; that when I went into withdrawal, then became dehydrated from the bowel distress and vomiting our little hospital didn't know what to do and was to scared to help - on a Sunday afternoon.  IF GIVEN THE CHOICE, please don't agree to it and save yourself a ton of unneeded misery. Best of luck and find a doctor you trust",Dad

This new Dr because of my depression said he couldn’t give me Percocet. Well then I also crushed a disc up to 20% after a week with him  then I fell again. He put me on Buprenorphine  5 mcg/hour. It took 1 1/2 hours to kick in. I’ve used 2 patches and I have had no pain relief at all. These suck for me. I see others on here say they are strong for them. I’m tired of Drs basing my pain on what they think should work for me. Everyone’s different. I just want to be able to work, do my housework bills etc. I haven’t been able to do much of anything.

It blocks pain relievers like morphine - fentanyl- ( protagonists- antagonist) that they use after surgery for pain management. I had a full hysterectomy while keeping the patch on - per my pain management recommendations/ huge mistake !!! I woke up after surgery basically screaming because they could not get me out of pain - it was at the least to say the worst experience of my life ! While I understand we are all different and each body works with medication differently - if you have a condition that requires frequency surgery - read up on Butrans and discuss with your doctor in-depth before you go under,Mommy1977

I have major concerns about this pill too, because I've tried most pain medications, and never felt euphoria with any until this one.

28,Buprenorphine,Pain,6.0,,"October 9, 2019",44,Belbuca (buprenorphine):I was involved in a methanol explosion that covered me in the flaming liquid. 50 percent of my body suffered from 3rd degree or higher burns. Was given hydromorphone in the hospital along with oxy 30s upon leaving the hospital was given oxy 10s then oxy 7.5 those seemed to try and help but still left me with quite a bit of pain. Pain management wrote me a script for 150 mcg belbuca. Started taking the medicine and it seemed to work better than the oxys but left me with bad headaches in the beginning and a really fuzzy head. Best I can describe it is like a really bad hangover but without the physical effects other than the headache. Just really disconnected and chemical feeling. Biggest problem is how sleepy it makes me. If I'm active and moving around I'm usually ok but if I sit down especially if I need to drive a car I almost fall asleep which is extremely dangerous so trying to plan when I can take my meds around if I need to go somewhere is really difficult.,Alac

Began with Norco and following that plateau was put on Fentenyl 100 mcg patches. Nothing seemed to last more than a year before resistance would build. Then, in 2010 my pain clinic wondered if I would be willing to try Suboxone sublingual - 8mg/2mg with Narcan. This has been a blessing, in that over the past ten years I have never had to increase the dose or frequency. I take it every 8 to 12 hours sublingual with excellent effect.  I now take buprenorphine tabs SL without the Narcan. This has decreased the cost by 75%, and no change in effectiveness.  If not for this medication, I dare to wonder where I would be at this point in my life. I did ween myself off late last year in order to prove to myself that it was in fact needed.
