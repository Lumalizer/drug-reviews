2,Ibuprofen,Pain,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 17, 2021",0,"I was told to take nurafen everyday for neck pain. Well after 5 days I got the most painful stomach pains and vomiting and got taken to hospital where they said don’t take it anymore as it can strip your stomach lining!

After using ibuprofen for months, I developed symptoms of stomach ulcers so I stopped taking it,  and within a day the feelings of being either hot or cold completely disappeared.  I can now sleep thru the night without waking up hot and sweaty.  I would also experience episodes of feeling extremely cold, oftentimes soon after feeling extremely hot.  I would put on extra clothing, go to bed with extra blankets until I finally warmed up.  These two symptoms went on for months, but has now completely stopped, shortly after stopping the Ibuprophen.",Suzie

13,Ibuprofen,Pain,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 28, 2019",6,"I was taken kicking and screaming off of Norco 10/325 x 6 daily and put on buprenorphine 2 mgs. twice a daily and ibufrofen (Advil) 200 mgs. as needed.  I did not realize the side effects from the Norco were so bad until I stopped it (severe itching, severe intestinal cramping, constant watching the clock waiting until my next dose).  I have lumbar stenosis and severe pain in my left foot.  The buprenorphine keeps it down to a level 3-5 most of the time and when it gets bad just one 200 mg OTC Advil knocks it back to 1-3.  I have yet to experience stomach upset at this low dose.  I wouldn't have believed it if you told me either.  Incredibly effective for an OTC pain reliever.",OriginalLHB
14,Ibuprofen,Pain,,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 18, 2018",8,"Advil Liqui-Gels (ibuprofen):I've been taking Advil liquid gel caps for years for the relief of migraines.  The last couple of years I've been developing itching scalp that followed with swollen eyes, lips and tongue.  I thought at first it was something I was eating or coming in contact with.  I never suspected it to be my Advils since I've been taking them for years and these reactions kind of new.  I've been paying close attention to what I do and eat and I found that it was most definitely the Advils that were causing these side effects which often sent me to the emergency  when my tongue would swell.  I just wanted to share this experience cause it took me 2yrs to figure the cause of my itchy scalp, swollen eyes, lips and tongue that would last for two days for swelling to reduce.",Bon

16,Ibuprofen,Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2018",8,Advil (ibuprofen):Advil works extremely well for toothache.  I was taking prescription Ibuprofen 600 and they don't work as well or as fast as original advil in my opinion.  Starts to work 15-30 mins after taking 3 for me.  This is an infected tooth that needed a root canal or is going to eventually be pulled.  I keep advil in my purse and will discontinue use after I have the procedure. Very pleased at how it stops extreme pain.  A godsend!,Pea

The ibuprofen helped with the pain initially, but it increased the tinnitus over time. It was great short-term, but not good long-term.

21,Ibuprofen,Pain,10.0,,"April 15, 2017",7,"I took 400 mg  every 6 to 8 hours ibuprofen in the hospital for chest pain caused by radiation for breast cancer.  Since coming home from the hospital after four days, I am now reducing to one 200 mg tablet every 6 to 8 hours. Will taper off in the next couple of days.

22,Ibuprofen,Pain,,,"August 17, 2016",3,Currently experiencing torn cartilage in my jaw after having my bottom impacted wisdom teeth pulled. The on call surgeon suggested these as well as the leftover oxycodine from my surgery. The tear happened about 8:35 this evening. Since then I've taken 3 oxycodine and 4 ibuprofen 800mg and nothing is taking away the pain. They did the job for the pain after surgery. But unfortunately nothing is doing it now.,Kmdool

29,Ibuprofen,Pain,6.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 1, 2014",18,"Ibuprofen was my default pain relief early in my experience with Ankylosing Spondylitis. It reduced inflammation and made the pain, discomfort and stiffness more manageable. I did experience some side effects (constipation, followed by diarrhea due to the blockage, stomach pains etc., but the pain management helped to make it bearable.

I sometimes take this with the prescription medication Maxalt (which treats migraines) I've have REALLY bad headaches and migraines since I was in grade school and took Tylenol until when into my late 20's. I then started taking the regular 2 tablet dose, 400 mg.

36,Ibuprofen,Pain,9.0,,"August 21, 2011",28,"Ibuprofen 600/ or 800 is a great pain reliever. Although I've taken many pain medicines over the years, ibuprofen I find to be just as effective as the strong control substances. It's a good anti-inflammatory too.

I have a lot of joint pain which I deal with without any drugs, but when it gets too bad ibuprofen works well and works fast, and lets just say when I injured my back it was a life saver. I just recently got burned on my leg (at a Spa, not very relaxing). I've had minor swelling and ibuprofen has reduced the swelling and pain. Would not recommend taking it on an empty stomach.If you're healthy enough to take it I would definitely recommend it.",AlfonsoG
40,Ibuprofen,Pain,9.0,,"October 17, 2009",19,"This medicine works super for pain if you take enough. I used it for many months for back pain due to disc protrusion. Chronic use gave me stomach problems. I used too much and my doctor claimed I was passing blood so I use it sparingly now, if the Tylenol based medicines do not work well enough. It helps mild headache to where Tylenol does nothing. When you start having heartburn or loose bowel movements stop taking Ibuprofen and use something else tell your doctor or you will hurt yourself seriously. Over the counter does not mean safe to use as you wish.",Ivan g
