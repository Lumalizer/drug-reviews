0,Belbuca,Pain,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 15, 2021",1,"I have Lupus, and then last year diagnosed with a very rare autoimmune disease that leaves me feeling on my best days like I’ve been in a horrible car accident. I had been taking increasingly higher doses of Hydrocodone to no avail. I can’t take any type of anti-inflammatory meds due to my DMARDS & Biological meds for my disease. I thought my life was just to endure untold amounts of pain. That’s all until I switched pain management doctors and first heard about Belbuca. At first, I was hesitant because I thought there is no way this is going to work. I’ve completely quit hydrocodone and couldn’t be happier. At first I was still getting the Norco but I tried a little experiment to see if my relief was in my head and only relied on the Norco and couldn’t make it two days and was right back to that familiar place of excruciating pain with little to no relief.",GAME CHANGER!
1,Belbuca,Pain,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2021",2,Belbuca is so terrible. It’s got nearly no pain relieving effects and it puts me in a really bad depressed mood. It also takes like 3 hours to even kick in and it also blocks the effects of other opiate medications so you have to wait days for it to clear your system before you can try a different pain medication. Stay away from this junk.,GI
2,Belbuca,Pain,4,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 28, 2021",5,"I have broken Harrington rods in my back. Surgery's not an option because nerves and scar tissue have grown around the hardware. So... I have chronic pain..I am on a stronger level of the belbuca and ...it does seem to take the edge off of spasms, and the strong cutting pains... but it just doesn't get you to a decent tolerable pain scale level...(for me thats about a 5-7)",1PrettyMess
3,Belbuca,Pain,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 11, 2021",4,"Belbuca (Inside Cheek Formulation every 12 hours) has been a LIFESAVER for me.  Unfortunately, I had been forced to take opioid medications after a car wreck which led to 4 lumber disk surgeries, 2 Cervical disk surgeries, a stroke, Sjögren’s syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Rheumatoid arthritis, Raynaud’s Disease, and other pain conditions",Dianne
4,Belbuca,Pain,2,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 6, 2020",93,"I am SO glad I looked at these reviews.I thought I was just being whiney about the effectiveness of this med, because Belbuca is barely taking my pain from a level 7 down to a 5. I promise I am not one to exaggerate my pain or complain but this med is not very much help for me at least. The package is difficult to open. It’s thin and you have to be careful when cutting it so that you don’t cut thru the patch.Pharmacies don’t keep much (if any) stock of Belbuca. Be prepared to  wait for the pharmacy to order it. I don’t have a problem with the patch not sticking (thank goodness). I can sense minor relief in about 45-90 mins. And the relief does not last  for 12 hour doses. ...unfortunately. I have broken Harrington rods in my back I’ve been in pain management for the last 23 years. I just always figured they would have some type of great miracle med for serious chronic pain... this Belbuca certainly not it...for me but I hope it helps you.",Married28
5,Belbuca,Pain,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 1, 2020",67,"I've been taking Belbuca for several months now. I was on the 300mcg and they brought me back down to 150 mcg thought the 300 may have been making me too tired. It hasn't worked for any of my pain at all. I've given it plenty of time to test. I will be asking for a referral to a pain management program because the GP doesn't want to prescribe anything stronger than this. My insurance covered it in full, but it's a waste of time because it doesn't work at all. I have no life with this pain.",Kc
6,Belbuca,Pain,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 29, 2020",80,"Was on the Belbuca 7 day patch but suffered from withdrawals every 5.5 days. If not complete withdrawals then pain all day in the sixth day. Got tired of it and changed to the 12 hour film. No matter how hard you try, it sticks to your teeth and takes about an hour to go away. I found it took care of my sciatica but didn't do a thing for stretched nerve pain. It would break through the Belbuca at about 11 am and screaming breakout pain would be with me for 12 hours. So I couldn't tell if it worked at all. Either my breakout pain was a hundred and the Belbuca was a ten, but I could not tell if I was on the medication or not. I hurt every day.",Skeetz
7,Belbuca,Pain,1,,"June 9, 2020",132,"Belbuca is expensive for and has a horrible, horrible side effect of not sleep and my knees are absolutely killing me. Worst pain pill I've ever bought that I paid money at a drugstore for as much money as I paid it's insane how expensive it is. We need to take our government back over for people in pain.",W.b.
8,Belbuca,Pain,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 12, 2020",73,"Belbuca the best!!!!!! i don't get high, but, NO PAIN!!!!! it's a wonder drug for me. Belbuca twice a day.",weeds
9,Belbuca,Pain,8,,"April 8, 2020",76,"I have taken Belbuca for a year now for all over body pain due to neurology damage. My doctor started me low and we worked up from there to the 300 mcg dose twice a day and we worked up from there. I think I may have experienced a headache in the beginning not sure. But it did help my pain, until it didn't then my doctor would increase my dose to the next level of patch. I'm now up to the 900 mcg dose. The only real side effects I have is being extremely tired and my body get really hot, which is a side effect. But this drug cost almost $900 a month! Insurance won't pay and I'm on a fixed income.",Ozarkqueen
10,Belbuca,Pain,1,,"April 7, 2020",58,Belbuca was useless  for pain in my opinion. No pain decrease whatsoever...  . Now I get to wait another month in pain to see doctor.  Thanks for nothing.,Richard
11,Belbuca,Pain,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2020",48,"Been using Hydrocodone and Oxycodone for 9 years, GI can't tolerate long acting medication and I still lead an active life and don't want to be intoxicate 24/7. Just started taking Belbuca, I normally have dry mouth so my first few times using it haven't been pleasant!!! Not supposed to eat or drink anything, have to brush my teeth to get rid of the smeary paste in my mouth. Makes me very sleepy and feeling dazed. Don't noticed much yet for pain relief, just more of an I don't care attitude. Going to using it only at bedtime. Definitely expensive, get a coupon for $100 off the first fill. Wouldn't mind paying for it if i knew it had positive results.",SD
12,Belbuca,Pain,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 17, 2020",59,So on Belbuca at 150 mcg twice a day for pain.Can't actually tell that I am taking it. In other words it is doing nothing for my pain.Also have to say the packaging can't be opened without scissors!And the little patch doesn't stay in place once you get it in your mouth.,RinkaD
13,Belbuca,Pain,6,,"October 9, 2019",44,I was involved in a methanol explosion that covered me in the flaming liquid. 50 percent of my body suffered from 3rd degree or higher burns. Was given hydromorphone in the hospital along with oxy 30s upon leaving the hospital was given oxy 10s then oxy 7.5 those seemed to try and help but still left me with quite a bit of pain. Pain management wrote me a script for 150 mcg belbuca. Started taking the medicine and it seemed to work better than the oxys but left me with bad headaches in the beginning and a really fuzzy head. Best I can describe it is like a really bad hangover but without the physical effects other than the headache. Just really disconnected and chemical feeling. Biggest problem is how sleepy it makes me. If I'm active and moving around I'm usually ok but if I sit down especially if I need to drive a car I almost fall asleep which is extremely dangerous so trying to plan when I can take my meds around if I need to go somewhere is really difficult.,Alac
14,Belbuca,Pain,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 14, 2018",104,"I'm shocked reading the 1 star reviews. I understand I was not happen to lose the Vicodin. But I'm pretty sure folks posting aren't being honest because the truth is this medicine is truly remarkable. I've had major injuries and neurological pain for years. After meds much stronger in theory, this has been the best. Two years completely pain free. Unreal.",Isaiah
15,Belbuca,Pain,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 4, 2018",49,"Throw it in the garbage or better yet, don’t waste your money to begin with. Major upset stomach, headaches and zero pain control.  Started at 75 mcg twice a day for a few days and won’t bother with it anymore. Tramadol works way better than this and Tramadol isn’t great.",Anonymous
16,Belbuca,Pain,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 4, 2017",66,I was on Fentynal  patches for year and a half @ 75 mcg.  I was needing a little more pain relief so the doctor was going to switch me to Butrans insurance wouldn't pay so he decided Belbuca.  I've currently been on it for almost 2 weeks I can't sleep more than an hour a day I have a massive headache all the time and my skin crawls like there's bugs under it almost .  I've talk to the doctor he will not listen it's not controlling the pain it wears off for hours before the next dose I can't hold food down and I have no desire to drink anything either.,SarahBrat
17,Belbuca,Pain,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 20, 2017",83,"I have been on oxycontin for the past 7 years, but my pain had been increasing more and more over the in the past few months.  I discussed my lack of pain control and he mentioned Belbuca.  We discussed all of the pros and cons.  I tried Belbuca and during the first two  weeks, it was a bit hairy. I may have been a bit apprehensive, so I didn't think it was working.  On the third week, my pain subsided, with Norco for breakthrough pain.    I didn't like the idea of being on oxycontin for such a long time, and Belbuca gives me pain relief I do desperately needed.",NoniCCURN
