0,Roxicodone,Pain,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 5, 2017",23,I recently had 3 very painful surgeries within 3 weeks. It's been a month & one week since my last surgery & I've been on Oxycodone IR 15mg every 3 hours (max 8 pills per day) ever since. I am a recovering heroin addict so this is a very slippery slope however i am now being tapered down VERY SLOWLY by one pill every 2 weeks until I can be off of them completely. I have a very patient & understanding pain mgmt dr. This med works extremely well as a pain reliever & is also very calming. I see the potential for addiction & the only downside is how fast tolerance develops. After a month & a half I feel like I need 30mg every 3 hours to do what 15mg did before but still it eases my pain & that is all that counts. I have zero side effects too!,Manic314
1,Roxicodone,Pain,10.0,,"December 28, 2013",69,"Long term chronic pain suffer great for pain immediate relief, last about 6hrs the 30mg very hard to get filled at pharmacy usually a 3 DAY WAIT TIME TO CHECK DOCTORS AND YOUR RECORDS.",lasvegasgirl67
2,Roxicodone,Pain,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 21, 2012",41,"Great pain relief ...but was like intestinal cement for me. Was continually constipated. Nothing helped this...enemas, Miralax, Exlax. Was horrible.",Girllovescats
3,Roxicodone,Pain,9.0,,"March 11, 2012",29,I agree with everyone.  This is the best pain medicine I have ever used.  I had Discitis which led to a Lumbar Lamenectomy and Multi Facet Joint Fusions.  I take 30mg every 4 hours.  It used to take the pain away every time but now it's not working too well.  I am going to see my Pain Management Doctor to ask for help. ,otstratman
4,Roxicodone,Pain,10.0,,"February 24, 2012",36,"After 11 back surgeries  (cervical,lumbar) due to scoliosis,and degenerative disc disease,I finally feel almost normal again. I have complete pain relief from my 3 a day Roxy 30 mg. and Fentanyl patch 150 mg. I have actually been cutting back on my Roxy as my condition improves. With virtually no side effects (constipation, sometimes drowsimess) this has kept me comfortable through all my surgeries and recoveries. Take only as directed by your Dr,and you too can experience freedom from your chronic pain. Highly recommended!",MRSDJMCW
5,Roxicodone,Pain,5.0,,"December 17, 2011",34,"This medicine was great. Like you all say I got my life back, but then I started to get to where I felt like I was 80 years old in the morning I had severe leg cramps causing me to walk like a 80 year old women would walk, and I am only 46. I had pain in my calves and in my heels, shoulder pain severe. I could not sit or stand for long periods of time. I kept telling myself that it not the Roxy I was on that was causing me so much pain because I like how it let me get my work done. But then when I started feeling the horrible pain in my calves that I could barely walk and made me very weak like I could not do my normal stuff, it put me into a depression because I felt like I was old before my time.",BlondyLocks10

7,Roxicodone,Pain,10.0,,"November 15, 2011",47,"Roxicodone has improved the quality of my life exponentially. Like so many others on this site, chronic pain has been a debilitating nuisance for me, one that I initially dismissed as a sign of aging. As my doctor confirmed a sciatic nerve compression, I was given Roxicodone to manage my aches and pain. Immediately, I felt years younger -- no longer am I stuck avoiding everyday tasks, such as grocery shopping, for fear that the pain will ruin my day. This medication has also improved my performance at work and at school, as I am able to concentrate without random aches and pains distracting me. I feel more rested when I wake up in the morning. Yes, this is a ""serious"" drug, but taking it as prescribed will get your life back - seriously!",Quetzalcoatl
8,Roxicodone,Pain,10.0,,"November 5, 2011",39,My husband has degenerative disc disease. He has had a two level spinal fusion on his L5 and S1 discs as well as two rods and six screws of hardware in his spine. He was only 27 years old when this injury happened. I totally feel for anyone who has to suffer from back pain. It changed his life forever. Normal activities that people take for granted everyday were almost impossible for him to do. He's been through numerous doctors and has tried every pain medication out there. He now takes 30mg roxicodone 6 times a day. It has totally been a lifesaver for him and given him his quality of life back. He still has some pain and bad days but nothing like before. ,loving wife
9,Roxicodone,Pain,8.0,,"September 8, 2011",33,"I've been taking this medicine for over three years. Started off at 30mg three times a day and initially it worked great.  Now, a few years later I'm taking 60mg three times a day and it is only about 50% as effective.  I recently added 30mg of Cymbalta and within three days, I was feeling great!  Better than I had felt in years!  I even cleaned the grout in my bathroom!  Unfortunately, my insurance company won't pay for Cymbalta.  So now I'm trying everything else. Unfortunately, nothing has even come close to working.  Now I can't even kneel down to even look at the grout I vigorously scrubbed three weeks ago.  It was like having my life back and then having it yanked away from me again!",Bradley Stuart
10,Roxicodone,Pain,10.0,,"August 24, 2011",30,The best by far of pain medication I have taken.  I like that it lasts all day.  I take the 30mg for osteoarthritis pain and neck degenerative disk pain. It makes me able to live my life. The BEST!,JoAnn53
11,Roxicodone,Pain,,,"August 5, 2011",15,Best medicine I have used. I was told to take it every 4 hrs 15mg tab. It usually wears out after 3 hours though I need to talk to doctor about this. But other than that I like it with mild side effects. The worse being mood swings and at night hallucinations.,tech 5
12,Roxicodone,Pain,6.0,,"July 7, 2011",20,"I have been on Roxicodone for almost three years due to my compression fractures and other chronic back pain. It worked very well in the first 6 months, but I then built a tolerance and cannot stay out of pain all day. Would recommend the extended release.",Anonymous

14,Roxicodone,Pain,10.0,,"June 2, 2011",24,Very good medicine for pain and doesn't have Tylenol in it.,JDON
15,Roxicodone,Pain,10.0,,"March 29, 2011",23,"If not for Roxicodone (oxycodone) 30mg tablets I'd have unbearable back and leg pain from a disc herniation. This medicine makes the pain go away, 99.9%!   I need 90-120mg/day. I also take Aleve 440mg, once every 2 days. I need something without acetaminophen for the health of my liver. Roxicodone has given me a life.",Peater From The U.S. :)
16,Roxicodone,Pain,7.0,,"September 16, 2010",39,At first this was a very good pain medication and it helped a lot but due to taking it for a few years the effectiveness is not nearly as good as to when I started taking it. Since so many people are addicted to these things when I had my medicine stolen from me I had withdrawals and it was horrible. ,Anonymous
17,Roxicodone,Pain,8.0,,"August 16, 2010",29,The perfect dosage for pain. One pill is all you need for 2 to 4 hours but it wears off quick in some pain cases. ,sillysweet
18,Roxicodone,Pain,9.0,,"August 2, 2010",52,"I have been using this medication for about 6 months.  Roxicodone 30mg every 4 hours.  It does work great takes the pain away within a short time period about 15 minutes once taken.  I have had 17 surgeries and have been unable to do a lot of things until I started taking this medication.  I don't feel tired or get a ""high"" feeling. I am happy I found a medication that works for me. Only one bad thing - I had when some of my medication was stolen.  I had to stop taking it.  I thought I was going to die  -  I was in bed for 3 days.  Like they say on this site put all your medicines up and follow the directions.  I wouldn't want anybody to have to go through withdrawals on this medication.  ",Anonymous
19,Roxicodone,Pain,10.0,,"October 3, 2009",48,"This medicine has worked wonders on my chronic back pain. I have tried everything from Tramadol to Opana ER and for the price Roxicodone 30mg tops them all if taken as prescribed, and at the same time each day. The only downfall is that you must take the pills more frequently than say MS Contin or Oxycontin where you only need them every 12 hours. However that was my main problem with the Opana, Oxycontin, Etc., they didn't seem to last the full 12 hours as advertised. I was lucky if I got a good 8 hours from them.",Anonymous
20,Roxicodone,Pain,10.0,,"September 4, 2009",47,"I was taking Oxycontin after 2 shoulder surgeries, then I was in a bad auto accident. Even upping me to 80mg 2 x daily wasn't enough. My doctor suggested the Oxyfast for breakthrough pain, so I tried it. This was the only combination that took away all my pain, so I could work and care for my family. Then Oxyfast was removed from the market and my doctor put me on roxicodone. It doesn't work nearly as fast as the Oxyfast which worked in under 10 minutes, this takes 30 minutes and works almost as well. At 29 yrs old I thought my life was over, but these medications gave me my life back. If it wasn't for these medications I don't know where I'd be now (10 yrs later). I have kidney and liver function tests done 2 times a year with no changes from day one.",Anonymous
21,Roxicodone,Pain,10.0,,"August 28, 2009",28,This is the best out there. I have been on Roxicodone for 2 years and it is the only pain medication that actually takes away the pain and it doesn't even make me tired.,flaswagger
22,Roxicodone,Pain,10.0,,"March 12, 2009",38,"I have chronic pain and have tried everything and this works best. Roxicodone is a great ""break through"" medicine. I take 8, 30mg pills a day as needed.  I also take 3 80mg pills of Oxycontin 3x a day for constant pain control.  This is a very large amount but after years it is needed. ",fallbrookchris
23,Roxicodone,Pain,9.0,,"November 29, 2008",26,"This medicine has allowed me to function as a 'normal' productive person. With the proper use of this medicine others have no idea that I live with severe chronic, intractable facial pain. As with any medicine, I can't give it a 10 because I wish I didn't have to take it. There is always the hope for a cure.",Anonymous
24,Roxicodone,Pain,9.0,,"September 21, 2008",22,I've been on Roxicodone for about two years now and this is the ONLY short acting medication that has worked.  I have been through all the short acting or break through medicines and Roxicodone is by far the greatest.  I am on high doses due to having gastric bypass and not absorbing as a 'normal' person would.  I need to have my tailbone removed as it's broken and swinging around back there.  Not to mention it's broken at a 90 degree angle or angulated.  INSANE pain. ,Anonymous
25,Roxicodone,Pain,10.0,,"August 17, 2008",42,I have taken this medication for severe sciatica nerve pain and neuropathy and over all it has been the best pain reliever I've ever taken. Far better than lortab that really does nothing for this type of pain. I also have degenerative disc disease and it helps with this also.,Anonymous
26,Roxicodone,Pain,9.0,,"August 11, 2008",61,I have degenerative disc disease and I'm in constant pain. My doctor gave me this medicine and it works very well. I can do now what I could not do before. I would recommend this medicine to anyone in severe pain.,chris2381
27,Roxicodone,Pain,10.0,,"June 10, 2008",67,I have severe osteoarthritis and advanced joint degenerative disease. I have been on many different kinds of medicines in the past including Methadone and I think the Roxicodone 30mg. is by far the best. This medicine you can actually function on and be totally out of pain!,simplycajun2006
