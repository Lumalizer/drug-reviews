After just 4 days my knees are swollen. I can’t bend my right knee. I have zero additional pain relief as I am on oxycodone IR. This medication is extremely expensive-$1200/60 36mg caps.

Also, if you can get your BP up for at least 20 minutes by taking a fast paced walk it also helps get the meds into your system much quicker.

I was now awake when vivid images of extension ladders started dancing together and singing about bilateral hernias.  They were literally were swirling about the room in front of my eyes.

429,Oxycodone,Pain,10.0,,"May 25, 2008",10,My doctor had to cut into my jawbones to extract my wisdom teeth that hadn't come in yet to ease the pain in my mouth. He put me on the oxycodone 10/650mg. They work wonders. While I was taking them I didn't even care if my mouth hurt. Then I got real bad migraines and the doctor thought they was caused by the pain pills. He switched me to something else and now I am still in pain. All in all I say oxycodone was excellent.,Anonymous

For me the combination is more effective than either alone.  I try to take the minimum dose necessary to control my pain, which for me is about 5 to 10 mg Oxy plus 60 mg codeine 3 or 4 times a day, depending on my level of physical activity.   As mentioned by others, tolerance and dependence or addiction (btw, not the same thing) are the main problems.",Anonymous
