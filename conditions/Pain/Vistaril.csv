0,Vistaril,Pain,8,,"July 28, 2015",43,"I take Oxycontin 60mg 3x a day, and Roxycodone 15mg 4x a day for chronic back/neck pain. Sometimes I do too much walking, or get severe neck pain that the pain meds don't control. I add one 25mg Vistaril and it enhances my pain meds effectiveness. About 3 to 4 hours later I become EXTREMELY drowsy, and often fall asleep, not good in the middle of afternoon! I think the occasional Ativan is almost as helpful, w/o all the sedation. Good drug, only if I can afford to be asleep.",SPIKEYSmommy

4,Vistaril,Pain,1,,"December 2, 2009",62,"I was given vistairl for pain soon after a neck fusion.  The surgeon refused to believe that I was in such severe pain after he ""fixed"" me.  Within hours of taking the medication I was in a deep fog.  I could not concentrate or think clearly.  This medicine also made my legs ache and I could not sleep until this medication was out of my system.",Anonymous
5,Vistaril,Pain,1,,"October 12, 2009",39,This medication made me very nervous and depressed. Almost like the effects I had from oxycodone. I had to stop taking it after 4 days.,hdstork
6,Vistaril,Pain,2,,"September 24, 2009",53,"I have seen vistaril prescribed a number of times for pain, especially muscle pain. I found it useless for pain itself, but it was great to potentiate opiates and stop rashes that might develop",leigh bray
