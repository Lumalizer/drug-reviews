0,Meloxicam,Pain,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 18, 2021",0,"Prescribed 7.5mg tablets, take 1-2 a day. I usually take 2. This medication is not at all effective for pain (in comparison to say oxycodone 5mg) and I plan on discontinuing it soon.",jaidentelford

2,Meloxicam,Pain,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 5, 2021",1,"I had sciatica pain from my buttocks down to my foot.  The pain in my butt was very bad. I could not walk more than a few feet some days.  Prior to this I was walking 3 or 4 miles several times per week.  Went to many sessions of physical therapy which did nothing.  Doc prescribed opioids, gabapentin, methacarbamol (SP?) and I was taking ibuprofen.  I was popping pills constantly for MONTHS!  They did nothing to relieve the pain.   At this point, they did not know what was wrong with me.  I thought I had piriformis syndrome based on internet videos.  Finally had an MRI that showed the LARGE bulge in L5/S1.   Got a cortisone injection in the buttock muscle.  That TOTALLY stopped the pain for about 10 minutes, then it gradually returned over a period of days/weeks.  Then doc prescribed one 15mg tablet of Meloxicam/day.   After a couple of weeks, the pain was gone, except for some minor tingling and foot numbness.  I should have gotten a discectomy. Now my insurance deductible is too high!",Guinea Pig
3,Meloxicam,Pain,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 20, 2021",0,"I was recently diagnosed with tennis elbow. My MD prescribed Meloxicam. Two hours after taking it I started experiencing intolerable leg pain (pain like I have never experienced), flu like symptoms (chills mild fever), fatigue, loss of appetite, loss of interest in work/hobbies, mild nausea. I discontinued the medicine twelve days ago. While side effects have improved, I'm still experiencing some. I can honestly say that I have never felt this bad in my life.",sheppards
4,Meloxicam,Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 19, 2021",2,It definitely helps me so much with my chronic pain. I can also take it daily and there is a lot less risk of GI  complications however I know it’s still a possibility. When I forget doses I definitely feel it because my pain increases but there is no detox or horrible symptoms as it’s not addictive. It’s nice because it works well and doesn’t make me feel funny like narcotics. I've been on it for 2ish years and it still works the the same as when I first started taking it! I take 15 mg tablet.,Teal blue
5,Meloxicam,Pain,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2021",0,"I suffered from sudden foot pain (probably a stress fracture). Aleve was working for me but my podiatrist put me on meloxicam since my stomach was not bothered by the Aleve. After the first day, I had a very upset stomach. I did take the meloxicam for a second day but was chewing Tums constantly so my stomach wasn't so upset. I stopped taking it after day 2. On the bright side, I had no pain in my foot for a few days. Now, I have some slight foot pain, but I'll live with that until the foot is healed.",Walker23

9,Meloxicam,Pain,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 4, 2021",5,"Doctor prescribed this to help with some of my severe chronic pain in hip, knee, and foot. At first I was amazed The pain was eased within a few days. However I gained 8 pounds in seven days with no changes to my diet. Now it has been 30 days and I’m about 12 pounds up from my original weigh. Not sure that this is worth risk and additional weight. I am going to talk to my doctor about some alternative. Disappointed!! pain relief was so good but can’t afford to gain more weight :(",Jedi mom

11,Meloxicam,Pain,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2021",6,"Taking 15 mg Meloxicam for pinched nerve until they can do injection or surgery. Takes 2 hours to kick in after taking it and then it wears off around the 20 hr mark making it impossible to sleep. I wait exactly 24 hr to take the next dose since it says 1 x per day, but that leaves me in pain 6 hr/day. I can take tylenol they say, but that lasts maybe 2 hours with the pain I have. I would need 6 tylenol just to get through these last 6 hrs.",Pinched nerve pain
12,Meloxicam,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 21, 2021",2,I had surgery on my ankle about 7 years ago for ligament repair. 4 years ago also I had suture removal and granuloma. A couple weeks ago I went back to the surgeon and he prescribed me meloxicam an it hasn't helped at all. It has been past the 2 weeks and that is when the pills are supposed to kick in.,stud
13,Meloxicam,Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 24, 2020",7,Already taking hydrocodone for chronic pain and I don't want to increase my dosage.  My Dr. prescribed meloxicam as an opiate adjunct but it does absolutely nothing.  I find ibuprofen to be far more effective.  Scary thing is most specialists I've seen try to replace the hydrocodone script while touting meloxicam's effectiveness.  They need to read some of these reviews...,Frustrated1
14,Meloxicam,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2020",6,"I've taken meloxicam for pain from endometriosis for about 6 months now. I used to take it with a different manufacturer, but insurance made me change pharmacies which in turn changed to this manufacturer. Almost immediately, once I started taking this manufacturer's pills, all of my previous symptoms of pain and inflammation came back. It is almost like I'm not even taking the meloxicam anymore. I am now having to pay for it out of pocket so that I can actually get medication that works. It is crazy how much can change from manufacturer to manufacturer. If it doesn't work for you with this one, try another. I like ZYD the best.",Endowarrior

16,Meloxicam,Pain,10.0,,"October 1, 2020",14,"I’ve had several MRIs, 4 different very invasive surgeries, & have been on several pain medications prescriptions eg hydrocodone, oxy & otc extra strength Tylenol, ibuprofen, etc. I was skeptical about my prescription of meloxicam 7.5 mg. But I decided to give it a try. I have several discs out in my back. It’s excruciating for me to bend over and pick things up or hold something slightly heavy. I tried meloxicam  and within 30 minutes I felt so much better. My back wasn’t aching, I was able to actually get things done. Extra strength Tylenol is great but it wears off rather quickly and I hate that I have to take acetaminophen everyday, several times a day. Another reason I was skeptical of meloxicam was because it said you’re not supposed to mix it with coffee, and I am an AVID coffee drinker daily. I highly recommend you give this a try if you have chronic pain like I do.  It’s a medication that will completely take away your pain without any addictive qualities to it.",PainMgmtPatient

20,Meloxicam,Pain,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 17, 2020",30,"My pain issues are from  7 herniated discs, degenerative back disease, arthritis in my hips, and saying this medication meloxicam gave me my life back is not an exaggeration.  I was using an ace bandage to keep bags of ice on my lower back almost all day. Applying bio freeze all day long. Sleep was almost impossible no matter what I did. Within 4 days of starting meloxicam I was able to weed my flowerbeds ( had been hiring a service for 2 years because it was excruciating) I sleep through the night and wake up  bit stiff, but not sore.",Meg
21,Meloxicam,Pain,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 21, 2020",16,"I have had lower R back/hip pain for several years. It was increasingly interfering with daily activities and some days I could barely walk and trying to get to sleep at night was torture. My Dr gave me Meloxicam, 15mg. Almost pain-free after one dose. And after 2nd day I had complete pain relief. Unfortunately I developed bilateral lower edema. I stopped taking the med a few days ago and the edema has resolved. Tonight I will try 7.5mg. Hoping I can still get relief without the side effects. Definite 10/10 without the side effects.",Neena

24,Meloxicam,Pain,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 25, 2020",13,"I’ve tried & quit meloxicam twice. Both times I couldn’t handle side effects after about 5-6 days.

25,Meloxicam,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 25, 2020",36,I have been taking Meloxicam for about 2 weeks now for a torn shoulder muscle (labrum).  The 15mg I am prescribed is absolutely useless.  I'm gonna try doubling and pray that it helps. This opioid crisis is scaring doctors from prescribing a true pain reliever.  Last 30 years Drs prescribing left and right and now when it is really needed they are scared.  Im very upset.,Looking for relief
