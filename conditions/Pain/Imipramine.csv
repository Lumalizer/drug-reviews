0,Imipramine,Pain,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 9, 2021",2,"I started at imipramine 25mg, 6 years ago. I’m now up to 150mg and it was worked great until the last month.",Livy
1,Imipramine,Pain,8,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 22, 2019",11,"I suffered from severe back pain and nerve damage from 2003 onwards . Chronic pain combined with trying to keep working , traveling the world and family life, led to depression . After visiting my GP he sent me to Psychiatrist who started me on Imipramine. 100mg at night . It certainly improved things for me . Life got better . Combined with Cortisone injections into the spine , I could now tolerate the pain and life improved . I am now much better and quite active and pain is less frequent. I’m on a mission to reduce the dosage and I’m now down to 35mg at night. I blame my high blood pressure and skin irritations on shins on the imipramine, but that’s to be proven yet. One thing, don’t try come off it yourself or play with your dosage yourself. I foolishly did that for a few weeks a few years ago and one day I thought I was having a stroke or vertigo. I was in total bits with electric shock like systems and a fear of going to pass out . Very scary .",The Wee Boy
2,Imipramine,Pain,9,,"September 27, 2019",12,"I was suffering from 'atypical facial pain' for two years which was absolutely excruciating (every other day). I held off taking a medicine such as this because I was concerned about the impact it may have on my (male) fertility. In the end I succumbed because the pain was just too much. 80 mg - 40 in the morning and 40 in the evening - have taken away the pain. I switched between this and amitriptyline for a while because this one does have side effects. I have an endlessly dry mouth so I have to drink a lot of water. Urinating can also be a challenge but the sheer amount of water I drink offsets this problem somewhat. Amitriptyline worked equally well but it was more sedating. Imipramine makes it more difficult to sleep at night but it doesn't send me to sleep during the day. Amitryptiline is worse for weight gain, in my experience, and both are equally bad for libido. Neither has been good for my anxiety. On the whole, I am extremely grateful to imipramine though.",TaiTai
3,Imipramine,Pain,9,,"September 14, 2016",34,"Taking at a very low dose to help me sleep as I have fibromyalgia related to arthritis.  I tried two other drugs before this one and both have me extremely bad nightmares.  I have found that I don't get nightmares with this one.  Within an hour of taking, I am solid asleep virtually all night.  I don't get foggy the next day.  I really haven't had any side effects except for a slightly dry mouth, but I am on 10mg.",Primrose2016
4,Imipramine,Pain,7,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 7, 2015",35,"I was prescribed this medication for chronic widespread musclepain(fibromyalgia) and neuropathic pain,and allodynia all over plus vulvodynia. It does take the edge off,and the pain is not as intense as it used to be, but still continuing sadly.  It did take away my sleep paralysis episodes,and sleep hallucinations, amazing for sleep too.Its a great drug, its the only one I can tolerate, I tried amytriptyline and all the SSRI's but the side effects been horrendous,and had a devastating effect on my functioning.The only effects imipramine have on me is some dizziness and drowsiness during the day, fast heart rate, and mild loss of libido, but other than these I feel its very useful with pain and sleep.The first few days expect nausea,and somnolence.",truetina22
5,Imipramine,Pain,8,,"April 17, 2008",58,I have been on Imipramine for over 2 years and found it good for pain relief combined with Gabapentin.  The only problem I have encountered is weight gain as it tends to increase my appetite.,Dunedin
