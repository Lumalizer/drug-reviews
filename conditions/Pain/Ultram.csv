0,Ultram,Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 26, 2022",0,Ineffective for pain. Same as tramadol. If you have more than slight pain it's as though you never took anything. Aspirin works better,Ultram
1,Ultram,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 21, 2020",6,"I was given Ultram after an eye surgery that repaired a blown out eye socket.Originally given Tylenol #3 but found I reacted to it with rash and severe itching.I only used two doses of the Ultram and experienced worse headache than not taking it. Its useless for post op pain.Doctors now days are careful (as they should be) when prescribing opiates, however,  not all patients are seeking a high. It's frustrating to be put into a fishbowl with drug users.If a patient is seeking any kind of medication for a ""high"" then any class of opiates should not be prescribed.  The possible side effects of Ultram in my opinion are scary just as the side effects of Norco and such.That's why you listen to your body and watch for any side effects. For those who are increasing the dose is stupid as well as dangerous. But if taken as directed,  although like me after 2 doses I knew it was pointless , there shouldn't be any real problems.",Anonymous

It didn’t work any better than Tylenol and he can’t have NSAIDS..... My mother was given Tramadol for pain. It never worked. She didn’t take any opioids on a regular basis either, so there goes the excuse of being hooked on any other opioid......The stuff doesn’t work. An almost full prescription sits unused. Now that I know that it also affect Serotonin Receptors, I really won’t touch it. No wonder people get addicted. One might as well be on Antidepressants. No Bueno!",Cookie361m

12,Ultram,Pain,10.0,,"January 12, 2017",48,I have taken Tramadol for year and have found it very helpful with my body pain especially my back pain.  I usually have to take ONE 50 mg of the pill and that really helps.  There are many days that I may NOT have to take it.  I don't find it addicting at all.  I take it only if I really need it.  My prescription says to take it 4 times a day.  I would never do that.  It helps with only one.  It can be constipating and that is why I only take one to give me  a lot of relief.  I take it now with a stool softener.  I am sorry if people find it addictive but I don't feel that at all.  Perhaps they are taking 4 a day. I do not plan on dropping this pill for my pain any time soon.,Raleighgk

17,Ultram,Pain,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 16, 2015",78,"I have been taking Ultram (brand) for 7 years for the management of chronic neuropathy pain in my arms, legs, hands, and feet, and I wouldn't change it for anything.  Non-addictive, effective 90% of the time, it's a rare day when the pain exceeds the drug's ability to control it. Yes, there is some occasional residual background discomfort; with chronic pain that's to be expected.  However, as long as I can function normally without a lot of adverse side effects and addiction, I'm a happy camper.  Please note this is for the brand Ultram.
