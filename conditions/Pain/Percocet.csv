4,Percocet,Pain,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2021",9,"I do not like this medication at all.  I was prescribed 10/325 after I had endometriosis excision surgery last year.  I had never taken oxycodone before and I don't want to take it again if I have another choice.  It made me feel incredibly loopy and brain foggy.  It took away the pain, but the side effects were awful.  I had some pills leftover because I wanted to stop taking them but I kept them in case I needed them later.  I had ankle surgery late last year and ran out of my week's worth of meds (I took them in a week but still had a lot of pain due to tendon repair and bone shaving).  I had the Percocet in my med cabinet and took half and it was horrible.  I relived the experience all over again.  I don't want this medication.",MissLeopard83

I just had back surgery and have not been on pain meds before surgery. I was prescribed 10/325 generic, they started to kick in about 20 minutes later, they only lasted about three hours.  They are the worst pain meds I have ever taken , the rb percocet are garbage, call your pharmacy ask who their  supplier is of that med, they usually will tell you. I asked the pharmacy if anyone else had complained they said yes, but the person said the get these pills really cheap.

8,Percocet,Pain,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2018",38,"I was prescribed Percocet 10/325 after a surgery and found it to be extremely effective at relieving pain. For me, personally, the effects lasted around 7 hours, after which I'd usually have to re-dose, at least for the first week after the surgery. Similarly, I found it extremely effective at reducing pain from cluster headaches when a triptan wasn't effective. It's not a recommended treatment for cluster headaches, but I did find it useful as a very last resort. The only two ""side effects"" were the very pleasant (and often addicting) euphoria from the Oxycodone, and the unpleasant cravings I had for it after discontinuing use. Otherwise, I was very impressed with it.",CLJ

10,Percocet,Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 9, 2018",18,"Was prescribed generic 10/325 after wisdom teeth removal and it made my recovery a breeze. Took one on a timer a few times a day, as advised by my surgeon, and it almost completely erased the pain. Only downside was that it wore off extremely suddenly (at least for me), so if I missed a dose I'd be met with excruciating pain around the 6 hour mark. I had no side effects other than constipation (which was easily taken care of by an OTC laxative) and pretty extreme drowsiness. I didn't mind that, though, because I needed the rest to properly recover anyway.",borluz

I went to my ear doctor, she placed a sponge in my ear canal to prevent it from fully closing. Fast forward, that same night, the pain was so unbearable I had to go to the hospital. I was also prescribed Percocet after my weight loss surgery. Mind you, I did not take my dosage every single time I felt pain. If I felt manageable pain, I laid down, didn’t do any strenuous activity and vice versus. The only thing that I made sure of was that if I took a dosage in public, that I was already on my way home because they knocked me out within 30 minutes. Also I did not drive.

I waited too long to take it last night and had to take a trip to the ER for morphine! the morphine was not much different than the percocet. My problem was that I waited. I have been taking one every 6 hours which is says on the bottle but I think I need to do it every 5 hours. Hopefully that's ok to do. I'm also on 800 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours.

16,Percocet,Pain,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 24, 2016",63,"Whenever I am in pain, this is my go to medication. I have a back, shoulder, neck, and foot injury and by rights should be on this medicine for chronic pain. For right now I only take it very rarely so that it works when needed, to avoid a tolerance. Because I am not working I am able to deal with the pain, however when I go back to work, I will most likely have to go on this medication or a similar one full time. The only thing I do not like is the fact that many of these narcotic pain medications contain tylenol, asperin, or ibuprofin which makes your kidneys, liver and other organs go through unnecessary stresses. I prefer it to be just oxycodone and if I need the synergy of tylenol I can add it on my own.",Foxtrotz

I now take less than one a day and try to use Ibuprofen instead.  My side-effects did not outweigh the benefits, but as you can see from reading the reviews, everyone has a different reaction. Mine are: constipation, so I took a laxative or suppository, slow reaction time, be extremely careful if you have to drive, if you can avoid driving, impaired/cloudy thinking, restlessness. When I go back to my desk job, I can take this during the day, but if you take at night, you may not sleep well. I plan to continue to taper off and use only when pain level above 5.

I was sent home for 5 days while waiting for the procedure and was given percocet 10 / 325 1 every 4 hours. Without it I couldn't have tolerated the pain. Also had very limited side effects, nothing like what the I. V. Meds caused and I felt much safer taking it vs the other more powerful meds.

While many pain meds make a person sleepy, this one has the complete opposite effect on me.  It made me extremely energetic/hyper.  I had overwhelming urges to ""spring clean"" the house, garage, and do things I had been putting off.  The down side of that, however, is it interferes with my sleep and I can't take it at bedtime.

Had 2 injections at L4/L5 that did nothing to relieve the pain and was finally given 10/325 percocet 1 twice a day but i find that 1/2 twice a day allows me to function and provides relief so I can actually feel like doing things.  I am disappointed that this drug is taboo I guess because of the potential for abuse, but anyone with real pain is not taking it for the narcotic affect but so they can lead a normal life.

I generally break the pills in half to match what would have been the Percocet level effect for pain as Vicodin is more potent.
