6,Aleve,Pain,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 21, 2019",14,"Aleve does nothing for me.  I bought some because people, including doctors, constantly tell me how good it is for all kinds of pain.  It does NOTHING for me.  I've used it for headaches, neck pain, joint pain - zero pain relief.  Two Advil are way, way more effective.  I feel like I've wasted money on a completely useless drug. Won't ever buy it again.",Vee

Took the round blue pill 220mg one after dinner. 4 tables in four days. I’m stopping it today as I got a sore throat out of the blues. Could it be a reaction.. ? I’m pretty healthy and I know taking medications is not my forte. Still I know it did help.,Alice
10,Aleve,Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 15, 2017",5,"Of the various OTC pain medications I have tried, Aleve has worked the best.  Though I'm not so much of a stickler when it comes to only buying name brands (oftentimes I've found that generics work just fine), I find that the name-brand Aleve has more of a positive effect for me than generic naproxen.  Nevertheless, I keep a bottle of Aleve nearby at all times.  It truly helps.",Julian Paul
11,Aleve,Pain,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 8, 2017",5,"I cracked a molar vertically into TWO pieces. After the initial two days (wherein a strong muscle relaxant was added to the mix) two Aleve for each dose kept me comfortable (nearly pain free unless I chewed on it) until I could get my quotes for a dental implant and get the offending tooth extracted.  I am post extraction as of today and again, two Aleve per dose has allowed me to bypass the opiod pain management ALTOGETHER!  Highly pleased and will keep Aleve as my goto pain intervention for intense pain wherein speed of results is the only option. ",Ms_Chrys

I went from not being able to walk in the morning, to jumping off a stage. I HIGHLY recommend Aleve. I have never been so impressed with a medication.

With this condition, pain is an everyday thing, especially back pain because I have scoliosis (a curve of the spine; side effect of NF1). In the past I would take 3 Ibuprofen, which had very little effect. Just yesterday I switched to Aleve; those first two pills really made a difference. My pain went away about an hour later and it worked a lot faster than the other medicines I've taken.Thank you, Aleve!",nf1survivor

I have sometimes severe pain in my toes and severe headaches from TMJ, and the Aleve significantly cuts down on my pain from both.
