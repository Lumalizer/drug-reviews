0,Aspirin,Pain,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 2, 2022",0,"Vazalore (aspirin):I liked it at first until I started seeing bruising on different parts of my body like on arm. I will discontinue use for it to stop. Not 100% sure this caused it, but when I started meds that's when I saw it. Anyone else notice this?",Missy
1,Aspirin,Pain,3.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 25, 2021",0,Bayer Aspirin Extra Strength Plus (aspirin):I believe Bayer Back and Body 500 has been using inferior ingredients. Using daily since 2014... I see a huge difference. Almost no effect.,Fibromyalgia
2,Aspirin,Pain,10.0,,"April 24, 2019",7,"Pharmacist told me to take 2 aspirin (500mg) every four hours, my pain has been greatly relieved and my injuries are much better when it comes to pain. Aspirin is cheap and very useful.",thomrosenthal
3,Aspirin,Pain,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 30, 2018",6,Bayer Aspirin Extra Strength Plus (aspirin):I prefer Aleve this product ,Dee
4,Aspirin,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 12, 2018",3,Bayer Aspirin (aspirin):I used this for minor tooth pain and it did absolutely nothing to ease the pain at all. Would not recommend this,Anonymous
5,Aspirin,Pain,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 8, 2018",5,"Bufferin Low Dose (aspirin):Due to  intestinal bleeding, I cannot take typical NSAIDs for heart attack preventative care.  However, because of the 'buffering'/magnesium in this product, I can, but in small doses.  I cannot find 81 mg of Bufferin so I take a 326 mg tablet and quarter it, taking it in the evening, 98% of the time without a bleeding problem.  When I have joint pain, I may double it but then bleeding can become a problem, again.",Michelangelo
6,Aspirin,Pain,1.0,,"January 10, 2017",4,"I have severe, chronic sciatica.  Aspirin does next to nothing for the pain.  Naproxen or ibuprofen are far superior.",Tiger55
7,Aspirin,Pain,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 31, 2015",17,"Aspirin is not a very effective pain reliever and has unacceptable side effects for me.  Namely, gastritis and ulcer.  I traded my daily ibuprofen for a daily aspirin after reading about its cardiovascular and cancer-preventing properties.  A month later, my stomach is wrecked.  I don't smoke, drink or do anything else that would damage my stomach this way.  I'm a healthy 30-year-old.My symptoms include nausea, burning pain in my back and shoulders, gas, bloating, indigestion and weakness.  I'm now taking Prilosec, Zantac and Tums with little relief.  While daily aspirin can save lives, it can also be harmful.  It's slightly harder on your stomach than other NSAIDs.  Don't take it unless you actually NEED it.",Anonymous
8,Aspirin,Pain,10.0,,"July 20, 2015",13,"For me aspirin works better than ibuprofen,acetaminophen,naproxen,ir relieves tension headaches and even back pain.",be2
9,Aspirin,Pain,9.0,,"August 19, 2013",25,I have been taking aspirin for the last 35 years or so for headache related pain. It is far more effective than Tylenol or ibuprofen. It's pretty safe and very affordable.,sjp in Sacramento
10,Aspirin,Pain,10.0,,"June 22, 2012",15,"Bufferin (aspirin):After having ulcers the doctor recomended bufferin for pain, that was 40 years ago. I have relied on that and extra strength bufferin since then. Since it was taken off the market I have tried others but they do not work as well. Please please bring the bufferin back.",Anonymous
11,Aspirin,Pain,9.0,,"July 25, 2010",27,"This would be the second most effective NSAID for me, behind Motrin but well ahead of Aleve or other OTC's of any type - It is my preference for ""cold and flu"" because it breaks a fever pretty quick.   If there is a downside, it's that if I take 2 or 3 a day for more than a week, it definitely causes a ringing in my ears, loud.   Short-term or simple pain, the old school aspirin just works.",Anonymous
