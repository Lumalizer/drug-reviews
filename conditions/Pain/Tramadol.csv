As the scar was healing I began getting pain from my right side of the scar, seems like the scar was not healing right. Each week for many months I was going to the doctors to follow up on my operation, I kept telling the doctors I have pain coming from my scar, so the doctors kept saying each week to take Tylenol. Finally the pain was too great and I really let them know I've been suffering for a long time with this bad pain and Tylenol has not done anything. They gave me Tramadol, when I took the first pill it did nothing, the second pill knocked out the pain completely, and it never came back, I felt immediate relief, finally. I disagree where I read to take this medication every day, not as needed, everyone's pain is different.

17,Tramadol,Pain,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 20, 2021",0,"When I read the description of tramadol, I literally laughed out loud. Seeing it side-by-side morphine was seriously funny. How ANYONE would say it's even close to effective in treating pain is beyond my comprehension. And all the things it's allegedly useful for? Doesn't work. It probably doesn't help that I've been taking it now for 25 years. The ebb and flow of medications given to me throughout the years (including the cocktails of meds for several) have introduced me to many EFFECTIVE pain killers. Unfortunately, I have to be treated at the V.A., and quite frankly, am lucky to be getting my paltry two doses of it a day. I won't go into all of it (because I'll become crazy-angry), but the ONLY thing tramadol does now is stop me from detoxing from it. Period. I feel so lost, and barely sleep anymore, since the pain is 100%. Tramadol doesn't touch it, trust me. If your doc puts you on it, or tries, refuse it if you can, do ANYTHING to not get on it.

I try not to take it on weekends when I have time to go to the gym (now that it's open again) and soak in the hot tub and/or swim.This is the only med, including OTC's, that has truly helped me.

My only issue was it seemed really weak. I really didn't feel much of a boost at all. Now, I'm taking a rare occasion trip to Mexico and grabbing enough for about a month.

25,Tramadol,Pain,5.0,,"April 26, 2021",1,"I have taken tramadol on two occasions. A while ago, I was exposed to fumes and got a nasty headache and sinus/allergy reaction. The headache lasted 3 days, OTC painkillers couldn't shift it, so my doctor prescribed this. I took one tablet and the headache was gone. I felt a little wobbly but slept it off along with the headache.Recently I have had an intermittently sore tooth and have taken one pill here and there. The first couple of times it helped with the pain. I took it at bedtime and must have slept through the side effects. Felt a bit blah in the morning but at least I got some sleep. Then it stopped working so well, and twice I got dizzy and almost vomited after taking it. (The first time I thought the nausea was caused by an antibiotic I was also taking, so that's why I took it again.)If you need a one-off painkiller for dental pain or similar, maybe it can work.

Even after that I got no pain relief, if anything it made it worse. A few hours after taking my second dose my heart was pounding and I started feeling incredibly tired, but every time I fell asleep I’d wake up from holding my breath, I also had difficulty urinating and I was dizzy and shakey/weak, nauseous and had no appetite for about 13 hours after taking the second dose. I had to call Health Link and speak to a nurse who told me to stop taking it because I was having an adverse reaction and that it would leave my system soon. I don’t take any other medications so I’m not sure why I had such a bad experience, having anxiety probably didn’t help.",EED

I was given Norco 10/325 for a week after the surgery, which really helped the pain but, after a week, I ran out and had nothing left.  I used a combo of Advil and Tylenol and it did not even touch the pain.  I should mention that the surgeon had to shave part of the ankle bone due to a spur, so that area was especially sore.  After some back and forth and tears, I got a prescription for Tramadol for a week.  I've never taken it before and wasn't sure how it would work.  I'm used to Norco, but I was told Tramadol would help my body taper down from opioids which I was OK with.  I HATE this medication.  I do not do well with SNRIs like Effexor or Cymbalta and Tramadol works like an SNRI.  It made me moody and depressed.  It did, however, help the pain more than Tylenol and Advil, so I will give it that.  However, I will let my doctors know that I don't tolerate the side effects well.",MissLeopard83

33,Tramadol,Pain,7.0,,"February 18, 2021",0,"I was prescribed Tramadol 50mg four times a day with Diclofenac 75mg twice a day, the two were used a pre-surgery pain control. The combination of the two really took the edge of my pain. I was able to walk moderate distances without a cane. However, every once in a while I would move it just right and I was at 8 - 10 on the pain scale. Therefore, I have to admit this pre-surgery pain regimen worked for my situation. You just can’t push it like I did. Once I was feeling better I did a few chores that exceeded the benefits of the medication.However, on an interesting note... I too felt the sharp pain in my right eye (as quoted here by another reviewer.) This sharp pain was instantly coupled with a pain behind my right ear. It almost felt like a bee sting behind the right ear. The pain only lasted less than a few seconds but, would return several times a day.Lukes-Cat",Lukes-cat

I take 1/4 to 1/2 50mg pill about 3 times a week. I try not to take it consecutive days if I don’t have to. It has worked very well for me numbing my migraines. If I take a full pill then I get undesired side effects like palpitations. It also has improved my mood and I don’t feel drugged out at this low dose. I was very hesitant to try this kind of pain med but finally decided I need to do whatever is going to let me live a halfway normal life. I was given it a year ago and tried 50mg and hated it and put it in the cabinet. Many months later as a last resort I tried it again but only 1/4 pill.

Usually, I take just one or two before going out. I can swear this stops any and all bowel movements for the day within an hour or two of taking it. It helps a lot with my stomach pain (that is part of IBS flare ups). It also decreases my appetite a little but it’s important to eat so as not to feel nauseous. I feel like it can lower the vision power a little .Also, it brings about the feeling of euphoria and relaxation but I don’t find it all that addicting. I can stop if needed. It brings about feeling of optimism in you, which is wonderful.Not many docs will even prescribe them anymore. That’s sad. Just give us the freedom to make our own choices..",Rose

Once it's converted over, it turns into M1 aka o-deso (for short) which is 6-10 times more potent than Tramadol, where it's real pain relief comes from. So People giving it 1 star? They are lacking proper metabolism OR they are taking a P2D6 inhibitor (some antiacids, like tagament), grapefruit juice, among others.
