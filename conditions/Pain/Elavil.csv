0,Elavil,Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 25, 2022",1,"I was prescribed this for nerve pain.  It just helped me a little bit with that, but I was amazed that my debilitating panic attacks went away within a couple of weeks.  It also helped my insomnia, which was also very debilitating.  I've had no side effects that I can pinpoint.   I was concerned that it could cause weight gain, but I actually lost a lot of weight because I used to binge on junk food when the insomnia kept me awake all night.  Now I fall asleep and I'm not awake eating.  This is the only medication that ever helped my panic attacks.",moonfire241

10,Elavil,Pain,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 4, 2016",66,"Was prescribed Elavil mainly for chronic headaches. Also suffer from depression, anxiety and insomnia so my neurologist had me start Elavil to try and kill many birds with one stone, so to speak. Elavil worked great to reduce the intensity of my headaches. Although they were still going on it was much more tolerable. I had been on Elavil only one month and a week before I stopped. First week my insomnia and anxiety seemed to be simmering down (This stopped soon after week 2). As for my depression... Elavil put it under a magnifying glass. I was suicidal and crying on a daily basis, it was not the medication for me... It helped with the main objective but at a horrible cost.",Fal

20,Elavil,Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 7, 2013",272,"This medicine is AMAZING for pain.  I have trigeminal neuralgia and I take it at night. It gives you a calm feeling and makes you not care about the pain.

I have a new doctor who yesterday started me on 10mg Elavil.

26,Elavil,Pain,9.0,,"February 29, 2012",262,"I use Elavil for fibromyalgia...it has worked wonders for my sleep issues. My overall quality of life has dramatically increased simply because I am able to get the sleep I so needed and its helping with depression/anxiety. It works better than Ambien. My dose now is only 50 mg...so glad I tried this medicine. I am very scared of antidepressants due to a horrible reaction from Cymbalta but Elavil is an older medication and its chemical makeup is different than most of the newer SSRIs. I went from sleeping on average of 4 to 5 hours a night...now I can sleep 10 without ever waking up..literally something I haven't been able to do in 5 years. This medicine is the best medicine for me, and I've tried everything out there as I have had Fibro for 8 years.",Anonymous

The pain radiated to underneath my right rib cage. After 2 years and many CT scans, my surgeon removed my gallbladder. It was diseased and had small stones, but my condition did not improve. My surgeon said that he thought my pain could be skeletal and started me on a muscle relaxer with a low dose of Elavil at night. My pain has almost subsided and my neuropathy is much better.

28,Elavil,Pain,8.0,,"December 22, 2009",177,"I developed near-total numbness in my thigh over a period of 2 months after which the surface pain was unbearable. I couldn't even touch the hairs on my thigh without gritting my teeth in pain. I saw a neurologist who couldn't identify the cause even after MRI, EMG and blood work. After trying Lyrica for the pain (which didn't help at all), he gave me Elavil. Using only a 25mg dose, the pain disappeared completely after one week.
