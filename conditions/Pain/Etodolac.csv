1,Etodolac,Pain,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 6, 2020",11,"Lodine (etodolac):Spending 8-12 hours a day on cement floors teaching I developed inflamed heel tendons, a sort of tendonitis. I could hardly put any weight on my heels, so my arches and balls of my feet were taking the brunt of it. I was getting lots of foot and leg cramps. Podiatrist gave me heel cups to wear and Lodine to take twice a day. It worked super well for me. I always need to drink or eat with the pill, but then no side effects I've noticed. It just eliminates the pain, within about ten minutes. It can come back quickly though if I do things that will make the problem worse, i.e. walking the dog, bending over to do gardening, going for a walk, lifting too much weight. Later on, I developed osteoarthritis and I've been taking the Lodine as needed for the pain. I like that it's non-addictive and it works for me, completely. Walgreen's stopped providing them and I don't know why.  I'm going to look into it because I really need them when I need them.",teachertype

4,Etodolac,Pain,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 1, 2019",19,"I’ve had osteoarthritis of my back and degenerative disc disease for several years and painful neuropathy of my feet for no good reason.  I noticed Etodolac helped my back right away and took the should muscle pain away that I had in the morning.  It took a few days for it to help my feet.  It was a wonder drug for several years.  I took 400 mg three times a day and omeprazole twice a day. It works somewhat on my back now, not nearly as much - but now I have osteopenia too. It still helps my foot pain but not as much so the doc added Neurontin which helps but lots of side effects.  And that’s all they can do for life except increase Neurontin.  Oh, did I mention that now they are threatening to take me off Etodelac because I’ve turned 60 and my chances of bleeding are higher?  And of course increase Neurontin to three times a day  so I can sleep my life away.",Me

6,Etodolac,Pain,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 14, 2018",14,I recently was put on etodolac 300 for costochondritis. I suffered 5 months of pain inside my chest. I took it right after I got the prescription filled and it had no effect. The next day I took it again and I felt so much better. I'm supposed to take it 2x a day but I only take it when needed. For now it works for me. Good luck all.,Anonymous

9,Etodolac,Pain,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 22, 2018",7,"I was prescribed this after I got a root canal on my bottom back molar or number 30. It does help with the pain, but it makes my stomach hurt very bad and causes me to feel a little weird. I am sensitive to pharmaceuticals but I still try, hoping I can find of that helps. I'd almost prefer the tooth pain over the stomach pain, but the tooth pain sucks. Especially since I am unaware when I start grinding my teeth, I've ground that bottom tooth twice now and am kicking myself. Anyway, this did help with the pain, it didn't take it all away.",FatLemur

The doctor prescribed me Etodolac 400MG. Instantly this medication has helped my pain go completely away. Although I am instructed to take one pill 2x a day with food, so far taking 1 pill per day has certainly worked for me after nearly one week. I am looking forward to walking my six miles 3 times a week following the holiday. I hope that I was helpful.",MFClayton

My doctor than added Etodolac 400 mg every 6 hrs as needed. At first I only took it periodically but I didn't see results. Then I began taking it 3 times spread throughout the day. I can now move and walk and my pain has almost disappeared. I did have some bloating and gas side effects, but can totally tolerate that versus the pain that I was in.",mmmtam

It didn't outweigh the hours of burning pain in my stomach, the copious amounts of gas I passed and sleep I lost because I couldn't lie down due to the heartburn it caused.

18,Etodolac,Pain,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 18, 2016",24,"I herniated a disc in my back and was in severe pain.  I waited one week to go to the doctor thinking it would get better on its own.  She prescribed Etodolac 400mg to be taken twice a day.  It took almost a week before I felt any relief at all.  It took away the excruciating pain but my back still hurt when I would bend over to pick something up, getting up in the mornings, getting in and out of my car and just standing up in general.  It also makes me drowsy.  Two weeks ago yesterday I hurt my back and I've been on Etodolac one week yesterday.

Fortunately, before I gave it up I noticed the effect it has on my gout.  It is like magic.  Taking a double dose and drinking lots of water stopped a major gout attack in hours rather than the usual ten days.  I now use it somewhat irregularly (whenever I feel I need some general pain relief, usually several times a week, but less often than the officially listed usage).  It's now been five or six years since I've had any problem with gout.  It apparently doesn't work for everyone, but for me it really works.",X

This drug helped tremendously, reducing my inflammation and therefore my pain as well, both when I was in severe trauma, and years later when I pull my back now and then. It increases mobility which is important, because then I can walk, cope in limited daily functions without being confined to bed, and I can instead help my muscles loosen and heal. I highly recommend this drug for herniated or bulging discs etc, etcsince it reduces I flammation, not just masks pain. The other meds I tried did almost nothing. Also, I have not experienced any side effects now, or when I was taking it every 12 hrs for those many difficult months.",Anonymous

I had taken various other NSAIDS and Narcotics and Etodolac is the only drug I have stayed with since IT WORKS.  No real side effects that I am aware of.  AND it is inexpensive.  I have degenerative discs, spinal stenosis and arthritis.  My back pain is constant without taking this drug.  While taking this, my pain levels are drastically reduced and I am way more functional.  I convinced two other family members to talk to their doctor about Etodolac and they too have had great results.  This is a no brainer to highly recommend.",Big Nut

My Doc put me on it when I was diagnosed with costocondritis (pain and inflammation in the cartilage between my ribs). After a while, I noticed that my arthritic knee pain had also subsided. A few months later, he diagnosed me with bursitis in my hip for the second time and I asked for more of the etodolac because of the success I had had with the abatement of my knee issues. I missed a full day of the medication, and I could REALLY feel every ounce of pain from my knees to my hip to my chest! Recently, I've been told that I now have the beginnings of degenerative disc disease in my lumbar spine, and my etodolac has been extremely helpful.

After surgery the pain was reduced from a 10 to a 5 which was almost tolerable. Ibuprofen caused constipation and aspirin caused stomach problems. A young female intern at the VA finally prescribed the Etodolac and now I live nearly pain free most of the time.
