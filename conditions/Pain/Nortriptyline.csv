0,Nortriptyline,Pain,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 23, 2021",3,"Nortriptyline is not for me! I take it for both cervical radiculopathy and sciatica. Although, it helps with some of the pain, for such a low dose of 20mg, I have so many side effects! Ever since I've been on it, I've been having severe mood shifts between anxiety and depression, uncontrollable panic attacks, insomnia, nightmares, a very dry mouth with excessive thirst, dizziness, nausea, and constipation. I can't get off of it because I'll be in unbearable, screaming pain without it. I let my doctor know that this was happening, and she didn't believe the Nortriptyline was causing my mood problems. Someone else told me to wait out the side effects for a couple of months, and it will get better, but it only got worse. Gabapentin made me gain too much weight causing the sciatica and caused mood problems , so I don't want to get back on that. I'm caught between a rock and a hard place because I've talked to about seven doctors and no one seems to know what to do.",bunnyflower
1,Nortriptyline,Pain,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 29, 2021",1,"I started taking 10 mgs of nortriptyline every night in 2018. At first I had some issues with very dry mouth to the point of feeling like I had strep throat. But, I buckled down and bought some cough drops and I'm glad I did. I was on the medication for 3 years and just recently got off. I forgot how much of a miracle drug it was for me and how much it really was helping me. I got off due to trying to get pregnant (per doctor's recommendation). However, after doing research of my own. I have found that it is considered safe. I have been on every other kind of medication out there for anxiety and depression and have had some terrible symptoms such as suicidal thoughts. I'm terrified of trying anything else and have decided to just get back on my miracle drug. My pain from my fibro is pretty high right now and I haven't been sleeping well.. which has been leading to worse and worse anxiety and depression. All I can say is that I can't wait to get back on my medication.",Saved Soul

3,Nortriptyline,Pain,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 17, 2021",6,"Jeez Louise.  Where to start.  Ok - for pain, it was like 60-70% effective when titrated but the side effects made me wish I was detoxing from Tramadol again.  I was FATIGUED.  So tired, I was bed bound for 4 hours during the day.  I needed 16oz Redbulls to make breakfast.  I was bloated.  So bloated I looked six months pregnant.  My boobs were swollen and sore. I was always dizzy. Like hold on to the wall or else you fall dizzy. And what is with the blue dots you see when you wake up in the morning??? I was coughing all the time - which in 2021 is a no-no with COVID. My insomnia was through the roof so I had to take it during the day time and not at night as prescribed.

Paracetamol and ibuprofen did absolutely nothing for the pain, after being prescribed a raft of antibiotics and other drugs like prednisone my doctor prescribed me amitriptyline which I noticed no difference in pain levels when taking. I then was prescribed nortriptyline 20mg and my pain level went to almost zero.

8,Nortriptyline,Pain,9.0,,"January 22, 2020",24,"I don't remember having nightmares on Pamelor or Elavil. Both worked well for migraine/facial nerve pain & depression. They'd be better if the side effects weren't dry mouth, constipation, dizziness & lethargy (Elavil). Remeron is a different story. I had the scariest, most traumatic dreams ever. I was so terrified after waking up, I told my doctor I could not take it anymore. Pamelor & Elavil are probably the best antidepressant that I have tried other than Effexor & Wellbutrin- although the latter gives me more side effects. SSRI'S don't work for me & cause agitation, insomnia, teeth grinding. I'll stick with the older antidepressants or the SNRI'S.",Bird

I’m 22 years old and I’ve been to lots of drs and specialist to find out what’s going on. Let’s just say nobody knows what’s causing it. I’m 22 years old and feel like I’m in my 60s can hardly get out of bed some days or even weeks. Two drs recommended this med for me and I refused to take it. My mindset is it is mainly used  for depression. But at the low does they gave me it was for pain. After some research and being stuck in bed hardly able to move I reached a point of I have nothing to lose In my life. I’ve taken nortriptyline for a few days now and it has helped wonders. I stopped for a day to see if what’s happen and yep pain returned. Hope now I can just take the meds and go to the gym to lose the weight and hopefully that’ll help too. My grandma was prescribed this and it didn’t help her. But for me it has. So everyone’s body is different just remember that.,Skaz

Due to it's very long half life, it seems to continue working until late afternoon the next day when I feel the pain return. Within 2 weeks of taking it I have been able to make my first gym visit in 6 months.The only downside I have noticed is when I feel acute flare is over and stop taking it, I feel low in mood/depressed. I also find myself awake at 2am (not from pain or anxiety, just not tired).

95,Nortriptyline,Pain,8.0,,"November 1, 2012",175,I have been on this medication now for 6 months for nerve pain and tingling down my leg from a trapped nerve in my back. 10 mg at night along with other Paracetamol and Ibuprofen certainly does relieve the pain. I was told to increase the Nortriptyline as required to 20 mg at night if necessary but so far I have not had to do that. Side effects have been virtually non existent against the benefit of it.,Anonymous

I tried Neurontin, Lyrica, Cymbalta...without any luck. Tramadol provided limited relief, but not nearly enough. Finally I tried Pamelor and after a few weeks the calf pain started to dissipate. I take 100mg/day and the side effects have been pretty mild. The drowsiness tapered off after a few days, but the dry mouth and constipation go with the territory. I get occasional tinnitus as well.",Anonymous

It is a miracle.,Anonymous

I am pain free and take 50mg which I build up too. After 6 weeks the only down side is I cannot drink alcohol but a small price to pay and if I try to reduce them I go back to the same conditions I had before taking them.  I take it at night and actually sleep for 6 hours straight pain free which I could not do before.  This medicine has given me back my life.",Very happy user

Though it took several weeks to really work, it definitely helped me sleep and my pain has decreased. I was started at a very low dose, which gave me a lot of flexibility to move up and down as the situation required. Taking the medication coincided with some slight weight gain, but this could have been due to a vareity of other factors. Overall I found it very helpful!",mmm2112

It saved my life. Chronic pain scrambles the brain. I was already on fluoxetine, but felt I was losing ground. Then my docor put me on nortriptyline. GREAT results. I feel better mentally, and the medicine somehow ""soothes"" inflamed spinal-cord areas. NOT my imagination-over the years, doctors tried several medicines for this, none worked. This one helped both the depression AND nerve-impulses at the discs/spinal-cord.",Anonymous

107,Nortriptyline,Pain,7.0,,"June 5, 2010",130,"I am still in the early stages of using this medication. My fourth week. It has really helped with the back pain. Although I still feel pain, it is not continuous in all areas of my back. It is now just if I tweak the source. I did not heed the warning to avoid alcohol the first week and was very ill as a consequence.  I was vomiting for 2 days afterwards and very dehydrated. My own fault. I am going to speak to my doctor to see if we should add to the dosage to try and get rid of the pain completely. I am currently on 10mg per night. Although I don't drink much, I do feel that I don't have the freedom to choose if I would like to drink. So, this is the down side to this medication.
