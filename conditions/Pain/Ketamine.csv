0,Ketamine,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2022",1,"I went to the hospital with a headache and they gave me ketamine.  I  had the most frightening experience in my life. The hallucinating and out of body experience was terrible.  I had no control and I thought I was going to die.  I am home and can't stop thinking what I went through.  It was horrible,  horrible experience that I ever had and I had no control",Kathleen wood
1,Ketamine,Pain,10.0,,"August 6, 2021",53,"Six years ago I dropped into a deep well of depression and chronic pain that I could not pull out of. I tried everything, almost every SSRI there is, mindfulness training, meditation, natural pathic medicine, yoga, massive diet changes, trans cranial magnetic stimulation, exercise and many more things. I spent a week at the Mayo Clinic. Nothing worked. The pain got worse the depression got worse. I was in a desperate state and hopeless.Six months ago I tried ketamine infusions. The relief was nothing short of profound. It has sustained. It gave me my life back. It was like magic. I never write on blogs, but I felt like it was my duty to weigh in with my experience. My duty because there are so many people who are needlessly suffering from the debilitating effects of TRD (treatment resistant depression and or chronic fatigue syndrome. There is hope for you. If you are desperate, give it a try. The odds are relief awaits you on the other side.",Matt T
2,Ketamine,Pain,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 14, 2021",10,"I have neuropathy in my feet. At times it's so painful I could barely walk. It felt like I was walking on glass shards other times, sharp rocks. I have tried everything from gabapentin to Lyrica. While Lyrica work wonders I had side effects. My doctor suggested the ketamine cream. It works wonders. My feet went from a pain of a 8.5 down to a 3.  While I do still have pain if I walk too much, My daily life has improved significantly. It's given me my life back.",aihtnyc
3,Ketamine,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 13, 2021",54,"Do plenty of research. My son 21, moved to Seattle hoping the change would help his severe depression and anxiety. He decided he wanted to try ketamine. I was against it. He was living in Seattle with his father. He ended up going through with the infusion treatments.   He finished his last treatment on a Friday and took his life the following Sunday. My therapist and I both believe that the ketamine gave my son the energy and courage to take his life. And I also think the clinic that he went to did not monitor him as closely as they should have. I spoke to the clinic and found out that they didn’t check in on my son after his final infusion. If you decide to try ketamine please make sure you are closely monitored . My son had such high hopes and was gone right after his last infusion. These clinics administering ketamine should have mental health professionals to keep up with the patients during , in between and after the final infusion. I don’t believe this was done.",Campr
4,Ketamine,Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 2, 2021",21,"Ketamine saved my life, relationship, and career. Autonomic Neurological dysfunction left me in pain and not able to function as I once had. Depression and anxiety intensified trying to find a diagnosis. After 6 infusions my mood has lifted and I don’t dwell on pain. I cannot imagine why this isn’t a standard protocol for depression, anxiety, and pain.",Qazwsx
5,Ketamine,Pain,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 15, 2020",12,"Postoperative pain relief for a broken forearm included ketamine.  It was awful. I've used psilocybin mushrooms and LSD in my late teens and early 20s several times which were mostly great experiences. However, the 2 minutes that followed each bolus of ketamine had me completely engulfed within a world which looked like a huge moving cubist painting. And unlike psilocybin, I no longer had the mental facilities to reason with myself. The pain returned between each bolus to the level it was before receiving it. Not for me.",Anonymous
6,Ketamine,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 8, 2020",11,I had a total knee replacement and the surgeon used ketamine in the hospital. I don't know where so many quacks think it works to the point of getting up walking immediately afterward. This is a horrible pain reliever for such severe pain. On top of that because I was in such pain I received no therapy in the 5 days I was in the hospital. 2 months out and still in extreme pain.,Tlm
7,Ketamine,Pain,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 11, 2020",13,"They told me that they would give me ketamine so I could have a CT scan because of back/neck pain. It was so strange. I thought I had died and heaven was just me being engulfed by white and black holes. (It was the drop ceiling above me. I truly thought I was dead. The next thing I know, I was aware of the team working to get me calmed. I didn’t like that at all. What a long strange trip that was.",TJ
8,Ketamine,Pain,10.0,,"May 17, 2020",36,"Ketamine has been a game changer for me. I take the pill powder form and it has helped with my nerve pain greatly. It was a long process getting to the right dose. You have to go slow to see how you tolerate it but when you get there it's amazing. It has also made my whole life better; it's made me happier and helped my depression as well. A very happy surprise. It has worked better than any medicine that I have tried so far from my psychiatrist. All this being said I really don't think it is for everyone it is a trial and error and it's if your body and if your mind can take it. But if it can it is an amazing drug. There is no withdrawal. You can skip days without Jonesing for it like all the different opioids out there. I had some major surgeries and was on opioids and needed them for the pain but hated being on them and then one of the surgeons messed up and now I have severe nerve pain, likely for the rest of my life, and opioids worked but I did not want to take them.",Campinghippie
9,Ketamine,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 3, 2020",21,"I broke my wrist and they decided to give me ketamine in the e.r worst thing ever I hallucinated, still felt them pulling on my arm the pain was horrible but that I could deal with I felt like they were trying to kill me slowly and I was paralyzed I had nightmares for a few weeks. After that I told the hospital that this med needs banned",Hope
10,Ketamine,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2020",31,"After a 5 1/2 hour spine surgery, I woke up in the post-op recovery room, on ketamine for pain control. It was ineffective. I was having terrifying hallucinations, and started pleading for something that would work. Just when the confusion, dizziness, and hallucinations would begin to subside, they would come up and ""refresh"" my IV line with more, perpetuating the side effects. Among the several bizarre hallucinations I recall, is looking down at the floor from my bed, which was stuck on the ceiling. It felt like I was defying gravity, and the potential for my bed to come crashing to the floor with me underneath it, was very real! It was undoubtedly the most unpleasant and terrifying hospital stay I've ever had!",pop
11,Ketamine,Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2020",79,"My personal experience with  ketamine after a urethra procedure was absolutely life changing. Not only was my pain under control but it had underlying side effects I did not expect. The experience alone put me in a state of pure..... bliss. Honestly idk how else to explain it. I whole heartedly believe this drug could and should be utilized for a whole array of uses. I suffer from a lot of mental and physical conditions. With one happenstance of receiving this drug, my conditions had been lessened to completely gone. If It was used and available for therapeutic purposes this drug could completely change so many people's lives. I honestly get enraged that really the only reason Ketamine and other medications that are considered ""Taboo"" are not being utilized as much as they should because of the pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies not wanting 100% of PEOPLE, to get better, be happy, have access to living good, comfortable, bearable, productive lives.",SHMEH
12,Ketamine,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 27, 2020",36,"I went for ketamine infusion for pain from fibromyalgia. It lasted for eight hours. My blood pressure became elevated and they me medication a couple of times to lower it. During the time of the infusion, I heard a nurse say ""she had an arrhythmia."" Being a retired nurse I knew that was not good. So I told them to stop the infusion and I went home. The next day I became very tachycardic and so went to the emergency hospital. They were able to get my heart rate lower. It was going at 150 beats a minute. I was in atrial fib and admitted into the hospital. I am now on a blood thinner because of it. People who are hypertensive and have cardiac problems should never have a ketamine infusion.I am very angry now that I have to be on blood thinners for the rest of my life.",Casie
13,Ketamine,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 18, 2020",39,I was in the ER months ago for pain and they have always given me morphine. There was an ER doctor who said that she cannot administer pain medicine for me I have no idea why. So she said she would give me an IV of something  different which  will help the pain. The effects started immediately and the pain was gone. However I told them to stop it after only 2 minutes. I literally thought I lost my mind. I was paranoid and the room was spinning. I can't imagine how I would have felt if I allowed the medicine to continue. In my opinion Ketamine should be banned. By far it's the scariest medicine in the world. I would rather be in pain then freak out on that stuff!!!! Horrible medicine!!,Ketamine sucks

Tried the infusions a couple years later after I finally got over that horror. The infusions are just too mind blowing & frightening being a spirit hanging upside down in a black cocoon of pure black with cardboard for a body that isn’t there. It’s such a powerful drug I cannot see this being healthy in the long run. I don’t need my brain fried on top of my pain.",LHS

17,Ketamine,Pain,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 10, 2019",23,"I started using Esketamine about a month ago  (for MDD,OCD,Pain) and take it via nasal shots. I'm up to 84 mg, or three doses in each nostril spaced 5 minutes apart.  My initial experience with it was a bit crazy but after 2nd visit things started to smooth out a little.  My most recent treatment of 84 mg was very intense. I had a mind trip while on Facebook though it didn't last long. The spatial distortions and disassociation are noticeable.  After it starts wearing off is when you feel really good. I also do transmagnetic stimulation with the Ketamine and the combo seems to work  well although it's expensive.  I'll probably stick with the TMS.",RFM
18,Ketamine,Pain,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 1, 2019",79,"Have had (8) spinal surgeries since 2009, so live with a great deal of pain. Years of pain meds were affecting my liver function and  not providing much relief.  Found a pain doctor who uses ketamine infusion therapy. Had some crazy experiences in the beginning doing ketamine IV infusions, but worked my way through the dreams and hallucinations as I knew that I must get off the meds affecting my liver and I needed better pain control. I’ve been receiving ketamine iv infusion therapy 4 days a month for the last 3 years as well taking oral ketamine daily and it has made a world of difference in my life! I can do things now that I would never have been able to do before. I’m off  6 other meds and my liver is doing much better now!  Ketamine has been a great way to help with my chronic pain condition.  My insurance covers the Ketamine IV infusion therapy, but I do have to pay for my oral Ketamine out of pocket.  I had a bumpy start but stuck with it and am so glad I did!",Chronic Pain Suffer
19,Ketamine,Pain,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 15, 2019",145,I was treated at a ketamine clinic in Feb 2018 for CRPS (chronic regional pain syndrome) with 3 - 4 hour relatively high dose infusions while monitored every minute. My depression abated after treatment 1. The treatments were 48 hours apart and I felt good going into treatment 2 with only mild anxiety. After sleeping off the treatment for about 18 hours I was nearly pain free.  After the third I was pain free. That remained the case for 4 months when I went for a four hour booster.  Pain free for several months. Then another booster and again I was ok. I’ve not been able to afford to go back and the pain and depression resulting from it have completely trashed my life. It is morally reprehensible that the FDA doesn’t make this treatment easier to obtain with more support to doctors so market factors would lower the prices. Thank you for listening.,Morebrainpainnogain

I have been in severe pain for 4 years. CRPS, pain every second of the day.  I had a few hours of not quite pain free...but, definitely tolerable.  I will be doing it again.  They suggest 4 to 5 to really notice a difference.",Ketamine
21,Ketamine,Pain,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 14, 2018",71,"I have used this for depression and chronic pain. I’ve had the IV and the dose was small. Anyway, the relief from the pain is fairly immediate and it’s such a relief to have no pain for 45 minutes. Amazing! For the depression, it’s really interesting. It doesn’t seem to take it away but it makes me feel  better  enough that my life is better and I feel generally cheerful and content and I don’t have to fake it like I normally do. That’s also a huge relief. I’ve not had any bad side effects so far. That’s probably because it’s very carefully supervised. I highly recommend trying it.",Polly

Since then with surprisingly little effort I have: gone from drinking almost every day to never drinking, from exercising never to exercising twice a day, I had been rarely brushing  to brushing, flossing, waterpicking, and mouthwash twice a day.

25,Ketamine,Pain,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2017",45," I had the 6 IV infusions done for pain and depression. It made me so much worse. My head stays foggy now and I feel lightheaded. It increased my anxiety and made my insomnia worse. I had an ANA test and found out I was positive for lupus. I think the extra stress from the ketamine may have triggered the lupus. I wish I had never done it. It was a huge waste of 3k and I feel so much worse. It has been 5 months since I had the treatment. I told them I wanted to stop after the third infusion, but they refused to give me a refund for last 3 treatments that I was made to pay for up front. I was told prior to treatment that I could stop after third treatment if I was not feeling better. But after they got the money, they refused.",lupus squirrel

28,Ketamine,Pain,10.0,,"August 30, 2016",79,I have a rare neurological disease that causes extreme amount of pain everyday of my life.  My doctors have tried their very best to get my pain level that is tolerable without much luck.  I started going to a pain clinic where I was introduced to ketamine infusions by IV.  At first we did a weekly session with 45 minute infusions that changed my life.  I still was struggling with significant pain daily so the doctor decided to start doing 4 hour long infusions once a week.  I can't remember in the last decade that I was able to achieve a pain level less than a 5 on the pain scale. Plus it has helped with depression and PTSD among other positive effects.  Yes it makes you feel pretty out of it but I can start living life again.,Hvw76

30,Ketamine,Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2016",54,"I have taken oral ketamine for 17 days. For me it is a miracle drug for neuropathic pain. Started at 10 mg daily by 2.5 mg caps compounded by pharmacy. Side effects are wet mouth or excessive salivation, a dizziness that my body adjusted to quickly, a feeling of two beers or a slight intoxication, mild anxiety.  The reward of a 3 point drop in neuropathic pain level is worth it. I feel my old arthritic pain again much stronger. A 8 as the CRPS specific pain is a 4-5!  Oral metabolizes into norketamine & hydro norketamine 5 times stronger than Ketamine. The iv dosing at high levels does not get this first pass metabolism and levels are higher mg than 15 mg. going to 20 mg after ok from doctor. I recommend patients with severe nerve pain.",CRPS Pain

I became very sensitive to light and that is still continuing as is the light-headedness, and unsteady on my feet. My blood pressure rose above 200, but my pulse rate dropped to 53.  I felt as though I had an elephant sitting on my chest and I felt that I was having difficulty breathing but observations did not support my feelings.
