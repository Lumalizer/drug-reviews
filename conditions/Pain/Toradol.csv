0,Toradol,Pain,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 10, 2022",0,I've been prescribed this medication numerous times. Dr's in nl are not allowed to treat based on patent history and must follow guidelines therefore the only medication they can prescribe in emergency are toradol and flexeril.

1,Toradol,Pain,1.0,,"February 22, 2022",0,I had a migraine went to ER and they gave me this and  it did absolutely nothing. Now in sitting at home still in pain. Might as well never have even gone to the ER.,Anonymous
2,Toradol,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 12, 2022",0,Toradol is useless & causes the most severe constipation imaginable. I have had it by injection 3 different times for 3 different reasons & it did not work for any of them. I will never agree to this medication again. My heart breaks for anyone given this as their only option to severe pain & post op. Shame on doctors. I can’t think of anything this may help. Not even a splinter. It will however keep you busy for days trying to resolve the stomach issues you get as a bonus to your pain that wasn’t resolved.,SoozieQue
3,Toradol,Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2022",0,"I had a deep cavity filled and the dentist warned I might need a root canal but we'd wait and see. He prescribed Ketorlac (Toradol) in case I had pain. Oh boy I had pain. I tried Tylenol, nope. Took a Toradol as prescribed and watched the clock. After exactly 30 minutes the pain disappeared. Literally one minute in pain, next minute gone. I felt normal again. It was wonderful. I was careful to take it with food and I also took antacids to be safe. I only took when needed as directed, and just for a few days until the root canal.  Coincidentally developed a migraine during this week and tried a Toradol to see if it would knock it away. Nope, no luck with that. Oh well.",Dental RootCan

5,Toradol,Pain,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 15, 2021",0,"I was suffering chronic neck pain caused by working at a computer at home from sunup to sundown. It became acute and hurt so bad that I had to put my hand behind my head to lower myself into bed, and once my head was on the pillow I couldn't move my head in the slightest without intolerable pain. Rolling onto one side was an indescribable ordeal, having to support my head with my hand behind my neck and making incremental moves until finally repositioned. Yesterday afternoon the doctor gave me a shot in the hip of toradol and last night in bed I was totally pain-free. Toradol in a non-steriod anti- inflammatory drug. It works by stopping inflammation, which in turn reduces swelling. When there is swelling, soft tissues in cramped spaces bind together and hurt. If the pain is caused by something other than inflammation, an anti-inflammatory drug is not likely to help. If it doesn't work for you, it doesn't mean it won't work for the next person. It depends on the ailment.",Painintheneck
6,Toradol,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 15, 2021",2,I have torn the cartilage in my ribs several times over the years from my cough variant asthma. It is agonizing and makes each breath painful which is not great for someone having an asthma exacerbation. The ER will only prescribe Toradol which not only does not work but gives me the worst stomach pain and bloating (which they think I’m making up for some reason). So I end up leaving the ER in more pain than when I arrived. It seems to be their go to because they don’t want to prescribe opioids but it just doesn’t work.,Cat

After they made sure my kidneys were working, they dumped a dose of toradol into my IV and wow, no pain. The effect lasted a couple hours and I was discharged with oral toradol while waiting for the stone to move. The oral form is a bit less impressive, but still decent.

21,Toradol,Pain,1.0,,"April 21, 2021",1,"I went into the ER because of a seven day long migraine. They gave me a shot of Toradol. Within one hour my entire abdomen was painfully heaving and cramping about every 1 to 2 minutes. For the first five days I couldn’t eat, and I couldn’t sit down, because sitting made it worse. So I paced my house until I was so exhausted that I could nap. Then I would wake up in the middle of the night and continue to pace until I was so exhausted I could go back to sleep again.   That severe heaving and cramping continued for five straight weeks. It took three different medication‘s to get it to stop.  It was the most torturous time of my entire life. I could barely sleep, and I couldn’t work.  Now, I can’t even take Advil. It causes the same response. (Before the Toradol I took Advil all the time with positive results.)",Meg

It also did diddly squat for the pain that I went in for.  I told the dr I wasn’t feeling right (sick to my stomach & dizzy at the time). He took my oxygen level & then gave me my discharge papers. That night, stomach pain. The next day, stomach pain & my body felt super fidgety on the inside. The next day, back in the ER because my stomach pain was getting worse along with my tremors. 5 days later, I’m still having tremors. My stomach is still hurting.

Went to ER, Dr rx Toradol. Never had it as am allergic to NSAIDS. (not even sure if its ok for me?) A few minutes after it was administrated via IV, I started having a severe headache along with pain down my neck. It did absolutely nothing to lower the excruciating tooth pain either. I'm on long term pain meds for my EDS (10+ years) I assumed my meds weren't working due to the bad infection. Was sent home from ER in worse pain. Later began having constant severe upper stomach pain after I got home. The horrible effects lasted hours. Finally took one of my normal pain meds in the evening, and it alleviated the headache & stomach pain, plus also somehow still worked 1000 times better for my tooth than Toradol.

It’s tender, sore all the time... I can’t lay on my left side (which is how I have slept for 20 years), It feels like there’s a bit of a lump at the site, and it hurts more when I walk because my muscles move.

They gave me Toradol it hurt at the injection site and made my back pain about 2x worse than it already  was.  It took over an hour to kick in and only gave me relief for about 15 min I then had to wait 2 hrs at a hospital with orders for xrays in severe pain all because I live an hour away from the hospital. My husband called and complained about it and we found out that because we went in with orders we should have been seen right away. I'm stuck with a useless hospital system that taking over every clinic and service possible in my area..

They gave me a shot to my hip and within minutes the pain level dropped from 9 to a 5. The relief was a Godsend. The anti-inflammatory in the drug opened the ureter and allowed blood clots and other debris to filter into the bladder. I was then prescribed toradol in pill form.

First off, the standards for what constitutes a properly sized muscle need to be reviewed, because 1/3 of the time, they'll give it to me in the deltoid, while the rest of the time, they insist on the gluteus medius. Regardless of where they put it, it doesn't help much with the problem at hand. If I happen to have a headache or sore back at the time, the toradol clears it right up. The severe pain it's meant to treat, on the other hand, barely has the edge taken off. The worst thing is that it causes intense soreness and cramping in the injection site for hours, far worse than a tetanus shot.

184,Toradol,Pain,9.0,,"November 4, 2010",11,"Quite effective for most severe refractive migraines and intense neck/face pain.  However, it can be a bit harsh on the stomach, especially if used more than once.  I self-inject at home (nurse taught me) and have had pretty good results, avoiding ER trips and the unnecessary use of strong narcotic painkillers.  Interestingly, Toradol didn't have the same efficacy when I was younger, about 15 years ago.  Now it has much more efficacy.  The drawbacks (for me) include: having to inject in the upper thigh, can only use 5x per month, and potential stomach soreness with repeated doses.",Precocity

Antibiotics, no help. Stepped up to Dilaudid no help. Then Toradol it really took off the edge. With a Dilaudid the pain is very manageable for the first 4 hours of the 6 hour span till next dosage.

I figured I might as well give a go.Toradol's efficacy, I must admit, came as a pleasant surprise.  It didn't relieve the headache entirely, but did quickly reduce the pain enough to make me pretty functional at the office.Side effects, for me, seem to be fairly minimal - I'm a bit groggy and woozy, but otherwise I have no complaints.
