1,Fentanyl,Pain,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 28, 2021",0,"This is my second month I was but on the fentanyl patch for cancer pain. Unfortunately I can’t remember the manufacturer of the first patch, it took about a week before I noticed any pain relief, and after that it did ok, then I received my second prescription and it was Mallinckrodt brand, this brand has not worked at all.  After reading a lot of your posts, it makes me wonder if something is going on,I know we are all different, and some things work better than others, but so many complaining that the supposed same drug is not working, leads me to believe that the powers that be may be at work making the drug less powerful, interfering with your healthcare that should be left between you and your doctor. I don’t know the answer, it is more big government bureaucracy, and the legitimate patients are the ones suffering.",Renee

I have had little issues with the patch. I have learned to cover them with transdermal patch to make sure they stay on. I am given Butrans transdermal to help with the highs and lows. I like the fact for me fentynal doesn't upset my stomach, doesn't make me tired, or make me feel high. For me Mylan brand is the way to go.

I've been on the same dose the whole time and I must admit, without it, I would be bed ridden and contorted.Actiq is a very serious medication that each prescriber/user needs to be educated, responsible and accountable for. I truly thank the good Lord for it because my quality of life has improved tremendously, without it my life would be full of pain and agony and I would be just a shell of who I am now. So, Actiq is great, just use with care!",Kristi Lynn
167,Fentanyl,Pain,,,"April 27, 2008",7,I am a 29 year-old female with a condition known as Arnold-Chiari Malformation. My massive brain :) is too big for my skull and sticks out at the foramen magnum by 7mm. I was misdiagnosed and treated for migraines for 2 1/2 years when the real problem was the compression of optical and cranial nerves. The 50mcg patches have given me my life back. I'm becoming tolerant to my breakthrough med (Dilaudid) and am wondering if the lozenges are available to chronic pain pts whose pain is non-malignant.,Anonymous
168,Fentanyl,Pain,10.0,,"April 22, 2008",159,Duragesic (fentanyl):I too am extremely greatful for these Duragesic Patches. My only recommendation to future recipients is to invest in paper medical tape. These patches have a tendancy to come loose or completely fall off prior to the removal date.,Anonymous
169,Fentanyl,Pain,8.0,,"April 21, 2008",17,"Fentora (fentanyl):Fentora, like Actiq, is a very fast acting pain medicine that starts providing relief within minutes. One of the advantages of Fentora tablets is that it quickly dissolves in your mouth, unlike Actiq, which is large and noticible.  ","Fast acting, but short life"
170,Fentanyl,Pain,8.0,,"April 9, 2008",20,Fentora (fentanyl):I was having a bad time with Kidney Stones and found this to work the best for severe breakthrough pain. I take OxyContin and Roxycodone for my back pain and have tried just about all the opiates but this by far works the best for me.,SleepRN

Percosets for breakthroughs and was breaking through every day, multiple times a day.  Then my doctor put me on Fentanyl patches (generic Duragesic), 25 mcg/hr., changed every 3 days.  Literally, my life changed overnight.  Pain is now down to ""noise"" level--yeah, I'm not 100% pain free, but no pain med can do that.  Now, I breakthrough maybe once over the 3-day period.",KAMPainRelief

174,Fentanyl,Pain,10.0,,"February 28, 2008",104,"Actiq (fentanyl):I have horrible nerve pain. Neither vicodin, oxycontin, morphine or any other opium based medicine worked. Plus my body had gotten used to the other pain pills. The actiq was AMAZING! It almost completely rid me of the pain (1000x stronger than morphine) and it is measured in micrograms (Mcg)it is so powerful. It was perfect for my burning nerve pain, and nerve spasms. Easiest drug to get BOTH chemically AND mentally addicted. Be careful",SugarShane
175,Fentanyl,Pain,10.0,,"February 25, 2008",22,I don't think I could make it without the patch. The pain in my back is at the point i can't live with it. The Fental patch is the only think that has helped. There is no way to take that much  pain.,Anonymous
176,Fentanyl,Pain,,,"September 19, 2007",26,I have been using the fentanyl patch for over a year and I find it to work great. Before this I was on time released oxycontin and I prefer fentanyl. My pain relief may not be taken as far down on the scale (1-10) but the breakthrough isn't quite severe. When they don't want to stick I use paper tape.,untilhealed
177,Fentanyl,Pain,,,"September 7, 2007",59,"Actiq (fentanyl):I have been a pain management patient for 4 years now.I am very sensitive to many medications and there are not many pain medications that I can take because I have such adverse side effects from them. The Actiq lozenge works very well for my breakthrough pain. It works very fast to releive my pain and the good thing is that I have control of my medication intake. Sometimes it is not nessesary to use the whole dose so,I never have to take any more medication than  I need.",hecate3
