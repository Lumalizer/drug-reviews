My roommate suggested I take some ibuprofen as well, and the combination of the two has worked pretty well- I'm still pretty sore but I'm able to function. Overall I'm pretty annoyed at how limited it is as a form of pain management, but since a major function is to reduce swelling I'm willing to give it a bit of a pass. Also, it was hard to swallow and tasted like rubbish since it was a pressed tablet that sticks to your tongue+roof of mouth, especially with a swollen and sore mouth",Tonguetied
