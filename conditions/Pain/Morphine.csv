5,Morphine,Pain,8.0,,"September 4, 2019",17,"I had a discectomy in 2015. I was prescribed 90 Morphine Sulfate ER 12 hour tablets (red) at discharge. I only took half the bottle during recovery for pain and saved the rest until today, when I ran out of a 5 day supply of OxyContin prescribed for upper jaw surgery on 8/27/19. They are still effective as ever. I don't have an addictive nature so I know I'll be fine taking them. My jaw pain was at a 8, on fire. Asked my surgeon for another 5 days worth of Oxy but she declined. I realize there is an opioid epidemic so I understand why. I think in a few days I can cease taking them as swelling will go down. I am thankful I had saved them. I'm here because I wanted to see reviews but a lot reviews are  only complaints. Morphine is for dying cancer patients/unbearable emergency nerve pain. It should not be prescribed for everyday use due to it's potency. There are other meds for all other pain cases. Don't be mad at your doc for not wanting to prescribe it because it is really addictive.",Kp
6,Morphine,Pain,4.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 27, 2018",4,"Iv'e tried almost everything and a low dose of morphine pills and injectables was only slightly better then a sugar pill.  4 mg IV and 15mg in a pill every 4 hrs wasn't useless but after a few years I couldn't tell if I hadn't taken it without the withdrawal cramps, yawns and teary eyes.  Fentinal patches were like 20x stronger and I thought better until I wore it in  a dry sauna.  Good thing I wasn't alone or I might not be alive.  I find a little soma, valium and methadone to be best. I just make sure I don't take the other 2 within a couple hrs of the methadone.  When it gets worse or flares up a couple perk 5s with tylenol help almost as much as a massage and stretches.  For sprains its all about ibuprophen and heat an ice for me.

Now I take 60 mg MS Contin twice a day and 4 to 6mg Dilaudid as needed for breakthrough pain. The plus is that the ulcers have all healed and although the pain is not totally gone it is very manageable. The minus is that I have had to gradually increase my dosage over the years because your body learns to tolerate it.
