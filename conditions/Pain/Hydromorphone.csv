I must say, it was the single greatest drug I have ever taken.  Took the pain away rather quickly and I couldn't have tolerated the same level of pain for another minute.  I was admitted to the hospital more recently for possibly even more intense pain with a bowel obstruction caused by an internal hernia.  I requested dilaudid and was given a drip of morphine - a completely inferior drug.  I was not out of discomfort until I was put under for the emergency surgery.  The only side effect form the dilaudid that I could see was becoming a comedian once it went to work.  The physician asked me some questions.  I could only speak gibberish.  The funniest part about it was that I was trying to be serious, knew I was speaking complete gibberish, and could not stop myself from doing it no matter how hard I tried.  With the pain I was experiencing when I arrived, this was a side effect I was readily able to appreciate.",Seattle Pain

I received it directly from hospital Doctors twice daily. After that week I asked when my next dose would come, they said I couldn't get anymore. So, I was in excruciating pain. Real pain. I asked what I could have. They said they had regular Tylenol, so I thought that was better than nothing so I took it. Of course, it didn't work and the pain just continued. Well, I guess they were tired of my whining so they released me. I was craving it for about a year. I got through it, but until I saw why today, I could never understand why. They never told me, and I just couldn't ask why. I won't take it anymore. I don't want to go through that kind of withdrawal again.

I have struggled for years trying to get through a month on my script of 5 a day.  No Extended extended release meds seem to help.  When I got home I saw they gave me Dilaudid 1mg.  I got excited because I thought this medication is a level below Percocet but found out 1mg of Dilaudid is equal to 3.33 Percocet.  It really burns me up that pain management feels one size fits all.  I never digested oral medication well example is I take testosterone injections because my body absorbed 0 of the patch and gel.

There are also times that dilaudid makes it worse such as rebound migraines. It doesn't always help.
