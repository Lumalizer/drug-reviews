Oxycodone was initially used to control the pain, but was ineffective. Oxycontin was then used but it didn't work as well as the Oxycodone most likely as it is time released. Under a physician's observation, several Oxycontin were ingested, but to no avail. However, I've been termed by several physicians and dentists as having a high resistance to anesthetics and pain killers.",Igor

At first I felt sick, and puked repeatedly, after 4 days nausea settled down.I been on same dose for 5 years, the way I did it is to expect and live with some pain, if breakthrough occurs then lie down, deal with that and do not up the dose, for the most part it works well.  There are no prescribing issues as I am in UK and there's no problem here, and it's OC that I get and not OP.Overall a decent painkiller if used sparingly, try to resist the extra breakthrough meds.",Mikey111
