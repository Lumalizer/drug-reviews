1,Ketoprofen,Pain,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 18, 2020",2,Ketoprofen is great for acute tooth ache and gum swelling. So thankful that it exists!! I took 100mg 1 hour later I felt much better. It really helped through the weekend. The pharmacist gave paracetamol but that thing never worked. never ever!!,Hani
2,Ketoprofen,Pain,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2016",7,"A few months ago, I started getting migraines while on my period due to a change in birth control. I love my new method and did not want to stop it, so I brought up the issue of the migraines to my provider. I've tried other NSAIDS such as regular acetaminophen and even tried Excedrin Migraine, but acetaminophen did not put even a dent into it. Excedrin Migraine only worked for 4-5 hours and then it would come back full force sometimes worse. My provider wrote me out for 50mg of ketoprofen, and I take 2 capsules at the onset of a migraine. This NSAID works great. My migraine was gone within an hour, and instead of being bedridden with ice packs on my head, I was actually able to eat and return to my normal activity. It is a God send!",LindsB32
3,Ketoprofen,Pain,10,,"October 6, 2016",13,"I have used this for 30 yrs off and on. I first started using for my migraines back when I was 30 years old. Then I realized it worked good for menstrual cramps. Then as I got older I used it for my osteoarthritis. Now that I am 60 years old. It helps me for everything! My arthritis, my knee, my fibromyalgia. I have used other non steroid anti- inflammatory medications but they just do not seem to work as good as Ketoprophen! I can count to the minute  how long it takes for it to work! This is a life saver medication for me!",Tobias Lee

9,Ketoprofen,Pain,10,,"September 12, 2008",26,Orudis KT (ketoprofen):It's unfortunate this pain reliever has been removed from over the counter use.  It was one of a very few that actually helped my pain from thrombic angiitis obliterans.  It also helped my brother and 2 sisters with migraines. In my view it is much like ibuprofen except slightly stronger and much more effective.,Anonymous
