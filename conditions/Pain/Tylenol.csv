1,Tylenol,Pain,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 15, 2021",0,"This is my break through pain drug for occipital and trigeminal neuralgia attacks. And after brain surgery, I took this around the clock for months for the nerve pain. It took my pain level from 7 down to 2 in about half an hour and lasted 4-5 hours. I could tell when it was time to take another dose. I carry a packet of the powder form in my wallet for neuralgia emergencies.",Spruce
2,Tylenol,Pain,10.0,,"May 22, 2021",1,The 2021 commercial is very sincere and touching.  I use tylenol and it works well for me.  After see the commercial I feel like the company is in business for more reasons than just the revenue.   It has worked well for me through a variety of medical issues and I will continue to use this product.  Thanks,Bj5551
3,Tylenol,Pain,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 16, 2019",29,"In the early nineties I was taking Tylenol for severe headaches. We had first responders in our workplace that pushed me to larger strengths and doses. ""You're a big guy, you need it, you can take it.""Don't listen.  Never go over the recommended dose for your weight,  It will permanently damage your liver.  My liver transplant was Dec. 19, 1996.",wclaybo
4,Tylenol,Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 8, 2019",17,"Itâ€™s one of the most worthless medicines I know of. I have tried Tylenol on numerous occasions throughout my life for migraines, back pain, menstrual cramps, post surgical pain, arthritis pain because some doctor or friend has recommended it. Each time it did absolutely nothing for me. Aspirin is a better pain reliever. Now with severe chronic pain, my Doctor wants me to try it again. No thank you. I give it 1 star because I never suffered any side effects from it.",taper-nightmare
5,Tylenol,Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 31, 2019",16,"I had a sudden experience of lower back pain, to the point where it hurt to breathe, and I wasn't able to sit because it meant bending my back. I took 2 pills of the extra strength. After about 15-20 minutes I could breathe without crying, it was still extremely painful to sit, but after another 15 minutes or so 90% of the pain was completely gone. So thankful  for Tylenol extra strength!",B.
6,Tylenol,Pain,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 11, 2018",18,"I have gotten migraines from childhood. I also am very active and sometimes suffer neck and shoulder pain resulting in yet another headache.I have used tylenol for my entire adult life and I cannot even think of what life would've been without it. I have always gotten high fevers with no other symptoms when others get sick. Tylenol has helped me thru all of it. From migraines, to horrible monthly cramps. Crazy when I think about it...It allowed me to function normally through some of the worst moments of life. I am, thankfully, a perfectly healthy 51 yr old and 2 hrs ago I woke with a sickening headache from 3 days of hard yard work. All gone now. Got to thinking...I should say...""Thank you Tylenol.""",Shell
