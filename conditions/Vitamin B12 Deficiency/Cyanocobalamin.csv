3,Cyanocobalamin,Vitamin B12 Deficiency,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 13, 2017",9,"I have been eating a plant based, whole food diet (vegan) for the last year and taking this form of b12 every day.  I take 1000 mcg twice daily and this has not helped at all.  I have become more and more tired and just don't have energy to do the normal activities of daily living.  I have been researching and found many people can not utilize this form of cobalamine and have taken methylcobalmine with great success.  I took my first dose tonight and will report back.  There was even a doctor who reported that in his practice he found the above information to be true with respect to oral supplementation.  He did say that injections of cyanocobalamine worked but the oral form failed.  Sublingual methylcobalamine did work with his patients.",hondoman45

Hoped it would help me trim off 10 lbs without the need for a diet. At first it helped, but after a few months I started gaining weight and developed muscle fatigue. I literally weakened by about 20% These injections began having a negative effect on me for everything I hoped they would help. I am not taking another one.",NotForMe
5,Cyanocobalamin,Vitamin B12 Deficiency,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 21, 2014",27,"Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin):I started injections about a two months ago. The first month was an injection once a week. Now I go once a month. The only thing I have noticed is a huge increase in back pain. I had to go to the emergency twice! No one told me I might have pain. But it makes sense, my nerves are waking up. Also I feel seriously bloated. Sometimes my jeans fit fine, sometimes they are tight. It's not vanity, I am fighting diabetes with diet and exercise, so the weight changes are disheartening. Other than the pain and bloat I don't really notice much difference.",Tessamess

7,Cyanocobalamin,Vitamin B12 Deficiency,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 4, 2014",35,"Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin):I was on Vitamin B12 injections years ago and felt good, the thing is my workmates mentioned how I was different.  I also have a thyroid problem and have started my injections again. I just didn't know why or what had me feeling so bad. I was diagnosed with BiPolar, but I wonder even with just B12 deficiency or thyroid alone, they have such a impact. But together I am very affected.  Once I feel better I will see if I am BiPolar.   The B12 injections do help, maybe not instantly, maybe days or longer, but they help 100%.",Koalamaiden.

I was diagnosed with breast cancer 2x and now am age 55 I increasingly find that I am dependent on the b12 for energy, mood and weight maintenance. I can tell when my levels are low without a calendar as this usually occurs about 3-5 days before the end of the month when I am do for my shot.",khbrook
