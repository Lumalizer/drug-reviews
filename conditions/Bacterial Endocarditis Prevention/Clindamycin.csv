0,Clindamycin,Bacterial Endocarditis Prevention,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 7, 2020",1,"Terrible experience with clindamycin! Prescribed it for phlebitis. After one week no improvement so doctor put me on it for anther week, 300mg x 4 times a day.. on the 5th day of the second week I woke with severe pain in all my joints from neck to toes and a fuzzy sensation in my head. I came off them straight away and informed the doc. I have been off them for 4 weeks and still have crippling pain in my hands wrists and pain in upper arms and slight pain in knee joints, also fuzzy head still. Had blood tests the result being I may have polymyalgia and have started a course of steroids. I know Clindamycin has caused this and I will NEVER take it againI'm hoping the steroids work and I can resume my life. Worst experience I've ever had with a drug.",Clarky
1,Clindamycin,Bacterial Endocarditis Prevention,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 6, 2020",3,"clindamycin is the best antibiotic Iâ€™ve ever had! 2020 was a rough year for me and had me try out multiple different antibiotics. The others(Cipro, Azithromyacin, and ceftriaxon) all gave me horrible side effects. Clindamycin gave me absolute zero side effects. Not a single one. 10/10",Lu
2,Clindamycin,Bacterial Endocarditis Prevention,1,,"October 3, 2019",5,"My son, who was born with 22q11 syndrome and has Truncas Arteriosis (heart defect at birth), I.T.P. is typically given an antibiotic prior to all dental procedures.  The dentist prescribed Clindamycin as opposed to the Amoxicillin he typically was prescribed.   With a few days, he got a rash in the groin area, and within 5 days vomited and had fevers on and off of 100.5 and lower (not typical).  He also got a red flaky rash on both sides of his nose, increased thirst, weight loss, and appetite decreased.  Due to clinical presentation of previous history of blood bacteria and endocarditis, 2 blood cultures taken a week apart showing negative results.  CRP (C Reactive Protein) and ESR both elevated in CBC blood results taken twice over 7 day period.  Fevers ranging from 99.5-100.5 have continued.",LP
3,Clindamycin,Bacterial Endocarditis Prevention,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 23, 2017",6,"I am taking this 3 times a day for 7 days for endocarditis (which I survived the first & only time ) prevention after a tooth extraction post an abscess on a molar.I neglected to thoroughly read the medication's instructions before starting and ended up with heartburn from hell with esophageal pain, bloating, burping, etc.When I finally got around to reading the instructions (thanks to this web forum) I ate a probiotic yoghurt and drank lots of water and did not lie down for 20 minutes post capsule.Whoopee! No heartburn, no esophageal pain, less bloat/burp; no stomach pain.It's imperative with this medicine to read and follow it's instructions beforehand!At this point I'll do whatever I have to in order to avoid another bout with endocarditis.",DennyPain
4,Clindamycin,Bacterial Endocarditis Prevention,8,,"October 26, 2009",13,This drug did what it was supposed to do in preventing an infection in a puncture wound in my foot.However on the 9th day of taking this drug I had an allergic reaction. Dose was 300MG 4 x's per day for 10 days. Hives broke out from my chest down to my upper thighs. My doctor told me to take Zyrtec or Claritin and should clear up the rash/hives in 2-3 days. ,Jan Reed1954
