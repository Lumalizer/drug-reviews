2,Cephalexin,Bacterial Endocarditis Prevention,9,,"April 16, 2017",7,Reading through these comments I am amazed nobody mentions the smell of the capsules.I 'm near 75 and have never encountered anything this foul. Really. Opening the bottle I thought of throwing it away.To get a capsules down I have to hold it away from my face and - essentially - throw it in my mouth.Takes a glass of water to make the odor go away.,paintcan9
3,Cephalexin,Bacterial Endocarditis Prevention,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2017",10,"I am taking keflex to keep from getting an infection for surgery that I had. The doctor had me start taking it one day before surgery and now I am on day twelve. Tomorrow is my last dose. I am having headaches and pain behind one eye. I am hoping the headaches will stop after tomorrow when I take my last dose. The eye pain started yesterday.  I'm looking forward to being done with the medication. I'm not a fan of antibiotics and 3 a day for 13 days, in my opinion, is a lot. I have heard it can be bad for the liver and kidney. Does anyone else experience headaches from this medication?",BlessedByFaith
4,Cephalexin,Bacterial Endocarditis Prevention,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 1, 2016",3,"I'm on this for when I get my teeth cleaned at dentist to protect me from bacterial endocarditis. So far so good but I read the bad reviews and the good reviews. I had to bring it down to 8 because I do get nausea feeling after this and if I burp, there is a nasty smell from your mouth being open when burping. The main problem I have with this drug is, that it makes my stomach hurt, like I am going to throw up. They way I am diabetic and eat at night. I can't eat big meal each time I take it 3x a times.So I drink milk and it helps pretty good with the pain in the stomach. I am only on my second day. Still makes my stomach hurt. I will get some more milk after this review. I am allergic to PCN and they still gave me this. I looked it up on the internet that it is a substitute for PCN. I hope I am okay after I am done with using it.",utahman1971
