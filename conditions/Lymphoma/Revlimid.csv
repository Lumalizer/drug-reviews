0,Revlimid,Lymphoma,1,,"June 9, 2017",8,"My wife has a rare aggressive cancer called plasmablastic lymphoma  PBL she has been on numerous chemos over 8 months which knocked it out of everywhere except the liver. She was accepted to go on Revlimid  25mg (it's still a trial drug in Australia) she took a total of 7 pills over 9 days with dexamethasone the first 4 days. Bottom line she almost had acute liver failure, it nearly killed her. She still hasn't fully recovered from it a month ago. Not saying it want work for others but be very cautious with this drug a watch the patient for reactions.",Husband#2
