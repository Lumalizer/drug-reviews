0,Xarelto,Deep Vein Thrombosis Recurrent Event,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 3, 2020",8,"2008, I broke my leg from a dirt bike accident, got a DVT under my knee on leg with the cast, then broke into Bi-lateral multiple Pulmonary Embolisms. Put on Coumadin for 6 months. 18 months later, working for 4 1/2 hours at a desk, stood up, had another DVT under the opposite leg, went into  Bi-lateral multiple Pulmonary Embolisms again!   Test showed Factor V Leiden.After 2 years, my Dr put me on Xeralto, living a more normal life.  Last 2 months terrible pain in my right 3 toes, Podiatrist noted that foot was red and warm, compared to left foot. Ordered an Ultrasound on my leg, have a blood clot?! He is having a Vasular Surgeon review and see it he wants to see me. Darn it, now after nearly 10 years this is happening?!!! I am concerned, 1) should my dosage at 20 mg be increased? 2) should I have surgery to dissolve or remove the blood clot? I am sure upset and apprehensive!!!!",Brian
1,Xarelto,Deep Vein Thrombosis Recurrent Event,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 29, 2019",8,I was put on Xarelto in Spain after I got a blood clot. When I returned to the US I stayed on it another two months.  It’s ridiculously expensive and has no antidote but I still gave  it a try. My last ultrasound still showed my blood clot was there.  So my vascular surgeon took me off it. My new hemotologist wants me back on it but  I don’t see any benefits to this medication.  I am going to try a natural supplement called platexia. Hopefully it will relieve my pain in my leg and foot and dissolve my blood clots.  (Old and newer) one from pregnancy the other maybe from birth control.,Nr
2,Xarelto,Deep Vein Thrombosis Recurrent Event,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 8, 2018",12,"I hate the side effects from Xarelto. I've been diagnosed with Leiden factor V blood disorder. Had been on warfarin for 10 years with no side effects however it was discovered blood clots were still forming in my legs. Was placed on Xarelto October 2017. Up until October I was very active in running 3-4miles 5 x week along with swimming 2-3,000 yards 1-2x a week. Now I can barely walk briskly.  Terrible knee joint and leg muscle pain. Can no longer enjoy running or swimming. Doctor suggested putting me on Eliquis....read other patient accounts for that drug and it seems worse than Xarelto. I'm alive but frustrated that pain from from side effects of this drug has severely restricted physical activity",Anonymous

5,Xarelto,Deep Vein Thrombosis Recurrent Event,1.0,,"November 22, 2015",25,I was put on Xarelto in July of 2015. I had my a very large blood clot that covered my whole left leg.. I took the drug regularly not missing a pill. I had another ultrasound droppler done on the same leg just week ago and I have another blood clot in same leg. Now this drug says your not suppose to get any more blood clots while on the drug. Well it never worked for me...,DDJJ
6,Xarelto,Deep Vein Thrombosis Recurrent Event,8.0,,"July 7, 2015",19,"Put on Xarelto 2 mos ago. for dvt in left leg.  3rd such occurrence.  Have a genetic disorder for blood clots. Only had mild headaches.  As for the stomach problem, after reading info on this drug found out it has lactose in it.  So being lactose intolerant I bought some pills for this condition, and take it before I swallow my pill.  Works fine.  No more stomach problems.  My one concern here is when I cut myself I do not bleed anymore than I did before.  So am wondering if this med is working for me.",MrSkittles
