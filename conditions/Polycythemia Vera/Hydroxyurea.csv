0,Hydroxyurea,Polycythemia Vera,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 21, 2021",4,"I have taken hydroxyurea for my Polycythemia Vera condition for approximately six months. Though this medication has effectively controlled my red, white and platelet counts, I have constant sores in my mouth and found through an upper GI Endoscopy that I also have them in my throat and throughout my upper GI area. I have had consistent headaches and dizziness since beginning this medication. My hematologist refuses to acknowledge that any of this could be caused from this medication. Since, I was only diagnosed with Polycythemia Vera six months ago, I have no idea where to go from here.",Kat
1,Hydroxyurea,Polycythemia Vera,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 25, 2021",6,After a few months of taking this medicine I had severe joint paint making it very difficult to walk. At one point all of my joints hurt. I went to the ER once I could make it to the car. They could not find the problem. Next to primary care doctor more blood work. I then saw a rheumatologist who did more blood work - nothing. Then I looked up side effects of the medicine and found that joint pain is a rare side effect. Went back to my oncologist and let her know what I found. She took me off the medicine and within days my joint pain was better. Very upsetting since I had asked already could it be the drug. Three doctors failed to check side effects! Back to phlebotomy.,Hodierne
2,Hydroxyurea,Polycythemia Vera,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 6, 2016",26,"My mom is in her 80's and was given this drug a year ago.  Shortly after, she developed red (painful) nodules on one arm and then the other that would NOT go away until she was finally put on prednisone.  She also has suffered from unexplained sore throat, difficultly breathing, along with no appetite.    No doctor can't explain what the nodules are, not even with many, many, biopsies, blood test,  cat scans ,etc.   She has a feeling of overall sickness that she cannot describe, has been hospitalized multiple times over the last year due to the symptoms. Again, all doctors say it's NOT the hydroxyurea that she has to be given when her hematocrit numbers climb too high.  Here we are a year later with no answers and my Mom is still sick.",Anonymous
3,Hydroxyurea,Polycythemia Vera,1,,"July 8, 2009",108,"I have had Polycythemia vera for 25 years.  I was started on hydroxyurea two months ago and recently developed severe petechial hemorrhaging.  I was admitted to the hospital with a platelet count of 9,000.  I received a six pack of platelets and over seven days (being off the medication) my platelet count had climbed to 74,000. As of Sunday, July 5th, it was at 139,000 (off the medication for ten days).  I was given the medication to help prevent the POTENTIAL of developing a blood clot. I have managed my Polycythemia vera pretty well without medication for 25 years (I do take baby aspirin) and wish I had never taken this.",Terri47
