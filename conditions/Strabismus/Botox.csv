0,Botox,Strabismus,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 18, 2016",1,My experience is not specifically about strabismus but general eyesight improvement. I've recently had my first round of Botox for wrinkles on the typical areas of forehead and eyes and after three days have noticed an incredible improvement in my reliance on my glasses. I generally have excellent vision but my eyes were constantly strained somehow and I could not function without the glasses. It's absolutely fantastic and should definitely be further investigated because just for this I am now hooked it is such a relief! Of course I am also extremely pleased about the aesthetic effect too.,Daniela_frm_DBN
