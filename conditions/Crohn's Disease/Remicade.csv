0,Remicade,Crohn's Disease,10.0,,"April 23, 2020",7,"I have Crohn's. Had symptoms when I was 2 years old, but was misdiagnosed for 5 years. I was officially diagnosed at age 7. I tried a lot of medicines as a child, but when I got a blockage located where the small and large intestines meet, it was time for Remicade or surgery. At that time, Remicade was new. My parents made the best choice and chose Remicade. I was 12 when I started and been on it for 11 years. Yes, it's longer than I should be on it, but I was finally given a life. My intestines look like I've never had Crohn's. There were side effects and over the years they increased. Now my body has gotten used to the Remicade, at age 23, and has spread to 3 of the 4 saliva glands in my mouth, blisters in mouth/throat, and facial swelling. Other than these beauty flaws, my gut looks great! Long story short, my antibodies are fighting the Remicade and I must face my fear and try something new.",Penguin Girl
1,Remicade,Crohn's Disease,1.0,,"October 25, 2019",10,I was on this for about 3 months and I felt awful almost every time after an infusion I ended up in the hospital. I decided it wasn't for me even though my Dr tried to force it on me.  I now have rheumatoid arthritis and a constant cough. I don't advise this drug.,Tess
2,Remicade,Crohn's Disease,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 28, 2019",12,There should be a class action lawsuit against Remicade. After 9 months' being on it for Crohn's I developed drug induced Lupus. I was in my 30's and felt like I was 90. I couldn't get out of a chair. My hands curled up and I had to get shots in my back and hands. This drug nearly killed me. My Dr kept pushing me to his physician's assistant and wouldn't see me.,Joseph from nj
3,Remicade,Crohn's Disease,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 18, 2018",18,"I went on this medicine in 2003 because of disease in my ileum. I was diagnosed with Crohn's the year before, and nothing had worked - asacol, prednisone, imuran.  Then Remicade was a LIFESAVER! I actually could live my life like a normal person again! I had a hard time scheduling my infusions because I was in college, so my advice would be to get it as close to your due date (7 weeks, 8 weeks, etc) as you can so you can get ahead of the flare. I've noticed that if I get my remicade late, I feel pretty terrible until my next dose. I've never gotten sick or had an allergic reaction from it, and I've been on it for 15 years. It's not working as well as it once did, so I'm hoping I can change to a shot so I don't have to sit through an infusion. If you're considering going on Remicade, I highly recommend it. It helped me live a semi-normal life. However, I did develop psoriasis about 10 years ago. I'd happily take psoriasis if it means I can be on Remicade. Best of luck!",Kenbridge86
4,Remicade,Crohn's Disease,,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 30, 2018",9,"Got this med two times, first time  I used it I got just a little cough, but couple of days later I couldn't walk at all, and the pain was really bad. Went to hospital, nothing found. The pain eased, so tried another time and my airways closed up. After a couple of years after this my hips still hurts , can't get up from bed or chair every time by myself. This shouldn't be used.",Bun
5,Remicade,Crohn's Disease,5.0,,"October 17, 2017",7,I was on remicade for about 4 plus years maybe 5.  This medicine does a number on your immune system.  When I started taking the medicine there were no warnings like there is now.  But basically felt great.  I live in Midwest played hockey get with this stuff.  The problem was I travelled West to Nevada and got Valley Fever.  Well had surgery about 4 months after being in Nevada and Midwest doctors had to idea.  Well come to say I had intestine removed to remove narrowing but was unable to take Valley Fever pills and pills to stop Crohn's from coming.  But valley fever would kill me as Crohns would just be pain.  So long story short don't go or live in fungical areas and take this unless you don't value your life and that will take you down.,Bob E M
6,Remicade,Crohn's Disease,4.0,,"October 9, 2017",11,I was on Remicade for five years and the Crohn's Disease went into remission BUT it did a number on my immune system.  I got staph infection and eventually a septic hip.  Had to have hip surgery which consisted of a spacer for 6 months as well as medication through a pic line.  In hospital for three and a 1/2 months and nearly another 3 months at home before I was in condition to have a hip replacement.  I also have kidney disease which is partly due to medications I took while fighting Crohn's disease.  Just waiting to die and get these diseases over with.   Really consider the side effects of Remicade - septic hip was not mentioned.,Don't have one
7,Remicade,Crohn's Disease,,,"August 3, 2017",5,"Who is responsible for the Patient who got very ill after using Remicade for Crohn's ??  I know have Rheumatoid  Arthritis, Lupus with fungal infection, which I will have the rest of my life. I had to retire early from work, On Disability.  My quality of life is not so good...I have tried but Jannsen Pharma Company who produces Remicade was like, so sorry...That was it. Not even helping me with medical care for rest of my life.  Rotten, really is rotten.  So back to, Who is responsible???",Cindylee60
8,Remicade,Crohn's Disease,6.0,,"February 7, 2017",5,I was on remicade for nearly 5 years. it was working great for me up until last October when I started developing sinus infections. I am in remission but yet I still can't work  - my life isn't normal anymore time to switch it up,izzypoops
9,Remicade,Crohn's Disease,1.0,,"October 26, 2016",6,When I started Remicade I felt amazing very quickly and even decided that I was able to start living my life again.  Unfortunately for me and my new boyfriend all the Remicade was really doing was masking my symptoms my Crohn's was very much still active as I found out on my 25th birthday when I was admitted to the hospital and then sent to a more qualified hospital as I live in a small town. I was in hospital for almost 2 months at this point trying various ways to try and get my Crohn's under control to no avail.  I ended up having my second surgery at that point and less than a year later having my third surgery. Remicade just wasn't worth the  $4000 per infusion in the end for me.,RachelV86

12,Remicade,Crohn's Disease,8.0,,"April 2, 2016",10,After a year or more on totally ineffective Humira I was put on Remicade.  It has been effective for the most part.  I am on the max dosage at every 4 weeks.   At about 4 to 5 days before my infusion I develop my typical crohns symtoms which mostly involves pain. I had one blood test which indicated I was metabolizing the medication more quickly than normal. I if this problem persists I will be tested again to see if I have developed antibodies to the drug.  Besides Humira being a total bust I react with high fever and chills to 6 MP.  Prior to the Humira I had a resection of a foot of my illeum.  I don't have any side effects to the Remicade just the issue I mentioned.,Danamy??

14,Remicade,Crohn's Disease,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 25, 2013",52,First couple trips are the worst but after that it becomes a routine and it works wonders I'm not lying it gave me my life back until my insurance couldn't pay now I use Humira no competition. Remicade hands downed so if you are doing bad try it.,festulizingchronesremsvmylife
