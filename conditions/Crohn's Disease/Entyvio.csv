0,Entyvio,Crohn's Disease,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 24, 2022",0,"I’ve had Crohn’s since 1968.  I’ve been on asulfadine, prednisone, Bentyl, amitripaline, parnate, remicade.  Prednisone worked but the side effects impacted my joints.  Second surgery in 2006.  Started Imuran.  It worked ok but not great.  At my age, the doc said lymphoma potential was becoming a possibility.  So I started Entyvio.  It’s been over two years.  I have my life with no issues except getting the infusion every 8 weeks.  No side effects.  Colonoscopy after 2 years showed over 90% reduction in inflammation.  Biggest issue is losing 2 feet at the end of the small intestine resulted in needing B-12, D, E, K, and iron.  BMS down to two a day unless I have certain spices or fatty meat, or anything deep fried.No medicine works for everyone, but this one has worked for me.",Anonymous
1,Entyvio,Crohn's Disease,4.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 15, 2022",0,I have been receiving Entyvio infusions for about three years for a Crohn's diagnosis of 40 plus years.I generally feel good but am plagued by frequent bowel movements - two to five time per day. Keeping a normal weight for my height is a challenge as it is a daily struggle to eat enough to replace nutrients lost during my daily purging. My current colonoscopies show that inflammation in my small intestine is 'stable' meaning it hasn't improved or gotten worse. When I first went on Entyvio I was told my Crohn's was in remission. Now I'm questioning whether Entyvio has run its course and time to try another treatment. I would rate the effectiveness of Entyvio at about a 4. If the number of bowel movements were to improve I would rate it close to and 8 or 9.,Kevin M.

I have had Crohn's for 35 years, been on every medication and I don't know if I should continue on it. I've had 4 bowel surgeries and my poor body is still in pain and sick everyday. I fight through and try to stay positive but the headaches are really tough. Anyone else have headaches?",Chris-T
3,Entyvio,Crohn's Disease,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 17, 2021",0,Been on this for just under a year now and seems to be doing the trick.

My inflammation markers have been trending down this whole time and I am now in remission. This drug works very well for controlling my Crohn's. I did not have any remarkable or lasting side effects from Entyvio until recently. After my 16th infusion I started getting a rash around my eyes, itchy eye lids, and flaking skin. The dry skin patches have now spread to around my ears and mouth. If this side effect can be managed, I will have no issue with this drug.",formiginha

I have been taking Entyvio for about a year now.  It has worked to greatly slow the frequency and urgency of my diarrhea.

13,Entyvio,Crohn's Disease,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 15, 2020",5,"I started Entyvio as my first biologic ever for Crohn's Disease. I was TERRIFIED of reactions and side effects. It turned out to be great. I get a headache and tired the day of the infusion and that’s it for me! After my third dose (they say the magic dose) I noticed a vast improvement in my Crohns symptoms! It also drastically decreased my CRP levels in a matter of weeks ! Unfortunately, 14 days and 9 hours after my third dose, my lips started to swell. They are thinking it’s a delayed reaction and taking me off the drug. A chance that the swelling is just an extra-intestinal manifestation of my Crohns (which entyvio does not treat because it’s gut specific) but they don’t want to risk it. I also developed antibodies (apparently no one does!) but they weren’t at a level that I would’ve needed to stop but for the lip swelling. I’m so sad to have to stop entyvio :( it has been great and I’m scared to start something else!",Em

He is now in the worst crohns flare of his life. The GI doctor at the local hospital said based on the amount of inflammation this drug has never worked.  Don’t try this drug!

16,Entyvio,Crohn's Disease,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 19, 2020",28,I started Entyvio about 8 weeks ago for fairly severe Crohn's Disease. I have to say I have felt significantly better than I have in years and each week has yielded better symptom relief. Significantly less urgency and trips to the bathroom overall. I don't love the IV infusion route but the results have been worth it to me. I am hoping the at home self administered injections gets released later this year to eliminate the infusion inconveniences. Far better than Humira or Stelara worked for me and with less side effects.,Mgconcierge
17,Entyvio,Crohn's Disease,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 9, 2019",13,I was put on ENTYVIO after my colon was removed and J pouch surgery and still had symptoms involving the pouch and area just above the pouch. I have been on ENTYVIO for 6 years. I started at 8 week intervals but over the last 2 years have had to go from 8 weeks to 6 weeks now at 4 weeks do to symptoms returning before next dose. Testing showed that at 4 weeks the level of ENTYVIO in my system was far below the recommended level. I hope that it continues to work for me. I started on Remicade in 2005 when I was diagnosed with U. C. I was on it a few years but ended up failing completely to help symptoms. I was then put on Cimzia which I did not respond to at all. I then was put on Humira. I was on it till 2010 when thyroid cancer was found. After thyroid was removed I was put on ENTYVIO. Due to the cancer I can't have imuno modifier medications. From Oct 2010 till early March 2013 I was on oral medication. Azacol I think it was or I was on that prior to the colon surgery.,Acrexp

It worked very slowly, but I did experience slight improvement. Made it to my 3rd dose. Within 9 mins of my drip for my 3rd dose my throat closing, face got very hot turned bright red, heart beat went faint and had the sensation of passing out (maybe I did, don’t remember it all). Definitely felt like I was dying. 911 had to be called. 2-3 hrs after the second dose I had the same reaction at home with heavy palpitations, but it would come and go.

I was recently diagnosed with liver cirrhosis F4 and had to stop methotrexate. I also take Apriso. My GI dr said I should start Entyvio. First infusion went fine. 2 weeks later I had my 2nd infusion. Within 2-3 minutes my chest tightened, throat started closing up, my face got extremely hot and throbbing and was swelling quickly.  The whites of my eyes turned completely blood red. The IV was immediately stopped and flushed with saline. Tried again with med going in slower. Immediately I started having the same symptoms. 3 weeks later I was given my first iv infusion of Stelara. Within 1 minute of the IV being started I had the same reactions but worse.

21,Entyvio,Crohn's Disease,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 31, 2019",27,I have had IBD (Crohn's) for 15 years.  Flares only controlled by prednisone.  Failed Imuran and 6mp with pancreatitis. Had limited success with Uceris but no great inflammation control. Melsalamine never helped much. Got a new G.I. and he suggested Entyvio after a colonoscopy showed inflammation.  Former G.I. was hesitant to use biologics but I really was ready to try something new.  I have had three induction I.V.s.  The I.V. is very easy.  I live close to the doctor's office and I am in and out less than 35 minutes. The only possible side effects are a scratchy throat and some mild itchy skin.  Both of these things could be unrelated.The nurse warned my Entyvio is slow to take effect but I *believe* it is working for me.  My inflammation is greatly decreased and my guts have healed.  So...if you are struggling with IBD and the doctor suggests this drug I would recommend trying it.,LolaT
22,Entyvio,Crohn's Disease,,,"July 27, 2019",21,"Started entyvio because Dr said Humira wasn’t controlling my disease based on my last colonoscopy, even though I felt great! A month later I had a flare and was in the hospital. 5 months after the first infusion my hair started to fall out as if I was receiving chemo! Then I put on 20 pounds and can’t lose it to save my life. Now I’m  constipated all the time. And as if this wasn’t enough, the insistent itching began along with the coughing and sneezing. Dr got tired of hearing me complain and did another scope and my intestines are worse than they were before! Going to try Stelara next. Unfortunately, entyvio stays in the system for ages.",TJ

These meds sort of controlled the symptoms but I still had flare ups.  Almost 2 years ago, I moved on to Entyvio.  Life has been so much better, as I don't have to plan my day where all the restrooms are along my sales route.  My colon actually had beautiful healthy pink tissue during my last colonoscopy.  I would recommend Entyvio to anyone with Crohn's to try before Remicade or Humira as Entyvio's side effects are less.",Cozmo629

It has erased my Crohn's symptoms completely. However, I want to switch to something that doesn't interfere with the immune systems as I have had Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for 4.5 years and can't exercise without getting sick for days. I think that there is a connection to biologics and CFS, which is my cause appears to be caused by the Epstein-barr virus. Lowered immune system, latent virus becomes activated etc.",jbri

Less gut pain and urgency to use toilet.The negatives: I feel uncomfortably hot sometimes, fatigue (although I have to say I am getting iron infusions because I’m anemic) gas can be bad( take protonix, gasx and Xantac.) Was on prednisone when I started Entyvio. Prednisone is heaven to me, but it is difficult coming down. I am afraid of this very strong drug, but I developed anti-bodies to Humira. Skipped any treatment for weeks, and went into Crohns Hell. (I wanted to stop eating.) No problems during and after injections Did get a mother of a sinus infection when I got last Entyvio injection early. 6 instead of eight weeks. I am having my eight week injection soon. We’ll see. If this one doesn’t agree with me, that will be it.But, I have to eat at least and not lose weight fast. I can drop 10 lbs just like that when my Crohns is active!",Serena

I had hundreds of knots form in my back. I ended up being hospitalized for several days due to a partial bowel blockage, this was several months after starting Entyvio so it should've been fully built up in my system.  Entyvio was absolutely terrible in all aspects for me and I would never recommend it for anyone.  Don't waste your time, money, and health it.",H

I do have some minor joint pain, but that could be just me aging.  I also have a lot of mucus in throat, but that may only be my lifelong struggle with bad allergies.
