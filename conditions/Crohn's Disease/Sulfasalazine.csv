1,Sulfasalazine,Crohn's Disease,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 22, 2020",3,Came down with crohns disease a year ago. Dr put me on mesalamine at $400.00 a month. Told her l needed a cheaper med. Put me on sulfasalazine at 3000 mg a day but only $16.00 a month. Works just as well if not better than mesalamine.,rd
2,Sulfasalazine,Crohn's Disease,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 30, 2019",18,"Diagnosed with Crohn's over a year ago and was in pain daily. Still waiting on insurance to cover gastro and surgery. In the meantime, my PCP offered up sulfasalazine and I agreed to try it. It's the first time I've been symptom free in years. I barely have any bloating or pain anymore and I have almost normal bowel movements again. I did feel an attack coming on so he added prednisone for two weeks and everything calmed back down. As long as I'm taking this and not eating too many processed foods or heavy meats, I'm good.  As far as I'm concerned, this drug has been a miracle for me.",thwackster
3,Sulfasalazine,Crohn's Disease,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 17, 2018",5,"I was getting gastric blockages quite often that caused a lot of pain and put me in the hospital on more than one occasion. I wasn’t diagnosed with crohns until after my surgery. After surgery my GI doctor gave me a couple of prescriptions for medicine that wasn’t covered under my insurance and I could not afford. We settled on sulfasazaline. I have been taking this stuff for 8 months now. I go to the restroom now more than ever. I noticed that if I would miss a dose or two, I didn’t have to use the restroom so much. This medicine caused bloating, strange noises in my abdomen, constant diarrhea, and abdominal pain. I recently took myself off the drug and feel my best since surgery. I’m waiting for my next appointment with my GI doctor to discuss other medicine or no medicine at all.",Crohny

5,Sulfasalazine,Crohn's Disease,,,"February 5, 2018",10,I took this drug every single day for 20 years and had no problems or side effects at all.I cannot get any Doctor to Prescribe it because they say it is too dangerous I say they make NO money so they want you to do the IV's that cost a fortune if you do not have insurance.,Magnus2112

Don't even realize I have Crohns disease most of the time. (Recommended).  There is that other part where everyone gets a different reaction thoe......",Mike $321
8,Sulfasalazine,Crohn's Disease,9.0,,"February 1, 2016",17,"I've only been taking this for 2 1/2 weeks but I'm very impressed that my chronic loose stools have completely stopped! I've noticed no negative side effects and if mild constipation is a side effect, I welcome it. I am now taking a little less loperamide and I'll be experimenting to see if increasing dosages of sulfasalizine will enable me to take even less loperamide. Later I'll get blood tests to make sure the new drug isn't having negative effects that I don't notice. After all these years dealing with diarrhea, I'm so grateful my doc suggested I try this stuff!",ljerrnbf5

10,Sulfasalazine,Crohn's Disease,10.0,,"May 24, 2013",28,"I tried Lialda, Pentasa, and a few other medicines for my moderate Crohn's Disease and they all made it worse. I tried Sulfasalazine and I am symptom free as long as I don't forget to take any doses. If I miss a dosage I may have some loose stool but after I go back to taking it I once again am symptom free.",eric017
