0,Inflectra,Crohn's Disease,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 18, 2022",1,"After being on oral medications the first three years after being diagnosed with Crohn’s, I was put on Inflectra after developing a fistula. I have been on Inflectra for two years now. It has worked wonders! Life is normal again with no more fistula problem and only a one-week flare-up resolved with next dosage of Inflectra. Inflectra is less expensive than other similars, but that doesn’t make it bad.",Miraculous
1,Inflectra,Crohn's Disease,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 30, 2021",2,"Terrible side effects approximately 2 weeks after each infusion (2 total). Developed UTI after BOTH infusions and required antibiotics to treat. Sinus infection developed after 2nd infusion. Incredibly tired all the time, joint pain, muscle aches, and return of Crohn's abdominal pain. It’s a complete nightmare. Biosimilar in this instance is a joke. Nothing similar.",Indy Crohns

3,Inflectra,Crohn's Disease,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 29, 2021",27,"Insurance forced me to switch to inflectra due to being cheaper for THEM for my Crohn's. I did not have a say, and insurance won't listen to Dr. recommendations. While on Remicade I only had flare ups 3 days a month during my period,  but no other issues or side effects. Yet after only 2 infusions on Inflectra I have multiple daily loose stools regardless of healthy diet, as well as bloody stools at least once a day.  In addition to Inflectra not preventing flare ups, inflammation, and symptoms; Inflectra has incurred more issues that I didn't have previously:Kidney painRib PainJoint pain: shoulders,  wrists,  ankles.NauseaHeadachesSevere Fatigue Charlie horse cramping in my hands, where I can't move my thumb; it's completely contracted.I'm in my early 40's with a toddler to try to keep up with,  as well as career to maintain, and this isn't fair to me or my family.",Soccer mom
4,Inflectra,Crohn's Disease,1,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 29, 2020",22,"I have Fistulizing Crohn's, dx'd 6 yrs ago @ 36yo- 11 surgeries since then: abscesses, fistulae, drains. Years of my life, my career, independence & ability to have biological children lost but Remicade saved my life. I've been in Remission since early 2018-.Trough levels in high 20's.At JUST that time, my insurance made mandatory switch: ALL patients on Remicade to Inflectra. Since that time, trough levels have steadily dropped to where I'm near rejection & TERRIFIED to start developing abscesses & fistulas again- I'd rather die. Seriously.I'm now writing to Medicare Commissioner who's probably some paper pusher w/o any IBD training to SAVE MY LIFE & give back my Remicade. Insanity. My doctor is  writing a letter on my behalf but she told me that she has been denied EVERY SINGLE TIME she's requested her patients moved BACK to Remicade. It's criminal that insurance companies pick drug therapy for a disease that literally BURROWS HOLES through my body. I am only 42 & deserve a chance.",KP
5,Inflectra,Crohn's Disease,1,,"August 1, 2020",8,"I been living with Crohn’s for 20 years. I was in remission with Ramicade for 7 years but after I started having flare ups I switched to Humira which didn’t work for me. I end up with a Ostomy.  About couple of months ago I start getting skin rash and blood work showed sign of active Crohns. I asked my doctor to try remicade again but my doctor recommended an alternative, Inflectra. I got the first injection 2 weeks ago. My blood pressure dropped to the point I couldn’t drive home. I was very tired the next day but felt ok after that. Couple of nights ago I had to go to ER. Severe joint pain,  sore throat, swallowing face and hand and fever.  In the matter of 3 hours I was in so put pain and could’t move. Worse experience ever.  For insurance companies  it cost way less than remicade but I am not putting my self in risk and getting the second injection",Parisa
6,Inflectra,Crohn's Disease,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 14, 2020",21,"I was forced to switch Biologics due to insurance company wanting to save some money. I was finally feeling somewhat normal after being on Remicade for a year. Now I am taking Inflectra and have been feeling awful. In and out of cramping, zero energy, nauseous all the time and a few other issues. I would like to think my health is more important than my insurance company saving a few dollars....",Anonymous
