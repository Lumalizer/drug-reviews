1,Ustekinumab,Crohn's Disease,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 13, 2022",0,"Stelara (ustekinumab):It took about 3 weeks after the initial IV loading dose to notice any symptom improvement, but my symptoms dramatically improved after the 3-week mark. I felt unstoppable between 3 and 8 weeks after the initial IV infusion. My stools went back to normal, abdominal pain was down, and my energy was WAY up. I had not felt this good in many years.Unfortunately, things started to fall apart after going to the subcutaneous self-injections. My symptoms gradually started coming back and flaring up in the weeks prior to my injection due date.It seems to me that Stelara is underdosed in some patients with the current FDA recommendation of 90mg every 8 weeks. When asked directly, my GI danced around that question but changed my dosing to 90mg every 4 weeks after a blood test revealed my drug levels were low. I wish Stelara was offered as an IV infusion because the subcutaneous injections just haven't worked as well. On a positive note, I don't have any side effects to report.",Anonymous
2,Ustekinumab,Crohn's Disease,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 1, 2022",0,"Stelara (ustekinumab):Was on Stelara in 2018 for 5 months, because my GI told me I couldn't stay on Pentasa forever. I luckily have mild symptoms of Crohn's when on nothing or Pentasa, but then when I switched to Stelara I thought it'd make my stools nicer and just help with remission (because although I don't feel like I have Crohn's, my colonoscopies and first hospitalization prove me that I do). On Stelara I experience a lot of fatigue/low energy, feeling like I had more symptoms than usual/cramps/nausea, looser stools than when on Pentasa. So I got off of it, never went back to get injections, and went back on Pentasa but those pills are way too big so I stopped taking them and I started feeling worse.But I never actually seen my results/bloodwork/stool check while on Stelara and I decided to give it another shot and see how well it's actually working on me. I'm again super tired, crampy, bloated, gassy, can't get over a cold. Hoping to see if it's all worth it at my next bloodwork and colonoscopy!",Keela

I was in the hospital every month for two years and it never worked.  I’ve had 5 surgeries since 2016 and Stelara was a life saver for me. I started Stelara in the beginning of 2019 and I am still not in remission, getting close, but it definitely makes me feel better and I have no side effects. No bleeding, which was a serious problem for me. Maybe tired, but I am always tired!!  Stelara and my awesome GI doctor have saved my life.",DawnL
5,Ustekinumab,Crohn's Disease,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 30, 2021",1,"Stelara (ustekinumab):Because Humira (and other TNF inhibitors) carries the risk of causing demyelinating diseases such as MS, and I'm already at increased risk of developing MS, I started Stelara without trying Humira first. I've now been on Stelara for a year (taken every 8 weeks) and it's largely been great for me. I had a lot of typical symptoms and complications from my Crohn's, including inflammation of my J pouch, blood in my stool, abscesses in the perineal area (leading to hospitalization), large, painful anal skin tags, and frequent, seemingly random fevers. All of these have almost completely cleared up since I started Stelara. I feel much better. I have had some side effects; I had occasional constipation for the first few months (has since cleared up), and frequently feel very low-level sick (slight sore throat, runny/stuffy nose), the latter presumably because of the immunosuppressive effect of the medication. Overall, though, Stelara has been worth it for me.",C.D.

8,Ustekinumab,Crohn's Disease,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 20, 2021",7,Stelara (ustekinumab):I just started Stelara to treat Crohns.  It's been a rough year with 4 hospitalizations and constant illness related to the disease.  I'm so hopeful that Stelara will allow me to stay off the oral steroids.  The steroids are super effective but of course horrible side effects.  I've gained so much weight I don't recognize myself.  I've only been on Stelara a week so too soon to tell but I do notice I'm sleeping a lot more than usual and I've been noticing a slight soreness in my throat.  As I've been reading the reviews I noticed a lot of people mention depression which is concerning as I struggle with depression anyway.  I'm hopeful Stelara may be the drug that finally works for me.    Good luck to everyone in your healing journey.,Barbara

I did still flare for the first six months, but I have basically achieved a full remission.
