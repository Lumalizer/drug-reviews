1,Hyoscyamine,Crohn's Disease,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 15, 2014",38,Levsin SL (hyoscyamine):I have been using Levsin SL for many years for Crohns (severe spasms). It is very effective.  Two years ago I started having severe spasms and leg cramps due to some unknown disease that is effecting my legs. I have constant pain in my leg muscles and long bones.  I also have severe leg spasms/cramps at night. I discovered one night when having both colon and leg spasms that the Levsin SL stopped the leg muscle spasms.  I discussed with my doctor and I started using at night to treat my leg spasms.  The spasms are quite severe with a pain level of up to 9 out of 10.  Levsin is the only medication that I have found that is effective.  The half-life for me is around 2-2.5 hours.,BlueNile
