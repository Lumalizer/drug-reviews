0,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 1, 2022",0,I’ve been taking Stelara for 1 1/2 years now for Crohn’s.  I haven’t gotten worse but haven’t gotten better either.   It also makes me super tired.  That could be the Crohns too.,Peter
1,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 13, 2022",0,"It took about 3 weeks after the initial IV loading dose to notice any symptom improvement, but my symptoms dramatically improved after the 3-week mark. I felt unstoppable between 3 and 8 weeks after the initial IV infusion. My stools went back to normal, abdominal pain was down, and my energy was WAY up. I had not felt this good in many years.Unfortunately, things started to fall apart after going to the subcutaneous self-injections. My symptoms gradually started coming back and flaring up in the weeks prior to my injection due date.It seems to me that Stelara is underdosed in some patients with the current FDA recommendation of 90mg every 8 weeks. When asked directly, my GI danced around that question but changed my dosing to 90mg every 4 weeks after a blood test revealed my drug levels were low. I wish Stelara was offered as an IV infusion because the subcutaneous injections just haven't worked as well. On a positive note, I don't have any side effects to report.",Anonymous
2,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 1, 2022",0,"Was on Stelara in 2018 for 5 months, because my GI told me I couldn't stay on Pentasa forever. I luckily have mild symptoms of Crohn's when on nothing or Pentasa, but then when I switched to Stelara I thought it'd make my stools nicer and just help with remission (because although I don't feel like I have Crohn's, my colonoscopies and first hospitalization prove me that I do). On Stelara I experience a lot of fatigue/low energy, feeling like I had more symptoms than usual/cramps/nausea, looser stools than when on Pentasa. So I got off of it, never went back to get injections, and went back on Pentasa but those pills are way too big so I stopped taking them and I started feeling worse.But I never actually seen my results/bloodwork/stool check while on Stelara and I decided to give it another shot and see how well it's actually working on me. I'm again super tired, crampy, bloated, gassy, can't get over a cold. Hoping to see if it's all worth it at my next bloodwork and colonoscopy!",Keela
3,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 1, 2022",0,"I've had Crohn's for 30 years.  Tried Remicade, Humira, now Stelara.  The only thing it's doing is worsening my diarrhea.  Not helping the Crohn's, but day of treatment and for weeks after, diarrhea is greatly increased.  No other effects.  Would be a great medication for those with chronic constipation!",JuneBug
4,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 11, 2022",3,"I started with Humira when my disease was so horrible. I was in the hospital every month for two years and it never worked.  I’ve had 5 surgeries since 2016 and Stelara was a life saver for me. I started Stelara in the beginning of 2019 and I am still not in remission, getting close, but it definitely makes me feel better and I have no side effects. No bleeding, which was a serious problem for me. Maybe tired, but I am always tired!!  Stelara and my awesome GI doctor have saved my life.",DawnL
5,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 30, 2021",1,"Because Humira (and other TNF inhibitors) carries the risk of causing demyelinating diseases such as MS, and I'm already at increased risk of developing MS, I started Stelara without trying Humira first. I've now been on Stelara for a year (taken every 8 weeks) and it's largely been great for me. I had a lot of typical symptoms and complications from my Crohn's, including inflammation of my J pouch, blood in my stool, abscesses in the perineal area (leading to hospitalization), large, painful anal skin tags, and frequent, seemingly random fevers. All of these have almost completely cleared up since I started Stelara. I feel much better. I have had some side effects; I had occasional constipation for the first few months (has since cleared up), and frequently feel very low-level sick (slight sore throat, runny/stuffy nose), the latter presumably because of the immunosuppressive effect of the medication. Overall, though, Stelara has been worth it for me.",C.D.
6,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 16, 2021",1,"This medication works but the price is too high. Did completely remove my whole psoriasis and helped me a lot with Crohns disease but increased my sugar levels, tryglicerides, ESR and CPR to the roof. I had to stop it!",Marlon
7,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 11, 2021",3,Did not help me so much I actually felt better being off of it.,Erik
8,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 20, 2021",7,I just started Stelara to treat Crohns.  It's been a rough year with 4 hospitalizations and constant illness related to the disease.  I'm so hopeful that Stelara will allow me to stay off the oral steroids.  The steroids are super effective but of course horrible side effects.  I've gained so much weight I don't recognize myself.  I've only been on Stelara a week so too soon to tell but I do notice I'm sleeping a lot more than usual and I've been noticing a slight soreness in my throat.  As I've been reading the reviews I noticed a lot of people mention depression which is concerning as I struggle with depression anyway.  I'm hopeful Stelara may be the drug that finally works for me.    Good luck to everyone in your healing journey.,Barbara
9,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 9, 2021",9,"Just started stelara,  I can tell I'm very tired and it gives me a little tummy pain and sore throat. I'm bloated but always have been on and off.  Harder stools at times constipated.  I've had 3 bowel rejections and now have 2 fistulas I'm praying I can get rid of my second  1 being on stelera. I'm still having a few flare ups with fistulas but hope I will work yet just started. I'm going to ear nose and throat doctor tomorrow  I've had ear pain inner ear and headaches and not sure if any is related to stelara it started at same time and hurts more a bit now but just had an injection 2.5 weeks ago.

11,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 20, 2021",2,"I have been on Stelara for nearly 2 years, initially it was 12 weeks and it helped but I found a month or so after it would wear off. I'm have been on it 8 weekly for a year now but have found its giving me more side effects after having it. This is my last treatment available but I sometime wonder if it does more bad than good and how long it will be effective for",Kflix

15,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 24, 2020",8,Stelara was a 1 star for the first 24 weeks. The waiting period was ridiculous. I just did my third at home injection so today puts my 32 weeks in I did not see any results until about 24 weeks on the medication. Stelara works  for crohn's you just have to give it time to work. Now we are starting to work on the dosing schedule to prevent flare ups around dosage time.,Joe
16,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 18, 2020",26,"I am 55 and was officially diagnosed with Crohn’s about 10 years ago after many tests and misdiagnoses.  I am convinced I’ve had it for probably 20 years. I tried Humira, Entivio and Stelara. The first two caused significant joint pain and brought no improvement to my Crohn’s. I started Stelara 10 months ago and am now in remission for the first time since my diagnosis.  No significant side effects other than some fatigue the day of and day after the injection. Very happy with this medication. Easy to use and only once every 8 weeks. Good luck to all those searching for their own ‘right’  medication. Stick with it and don’t lose hope!",JMS

Started with Humira and found that I was a nonresponder.  For the rest of 2018, and into 2019, I tried other meds and battled with my insurance on which medicine is covered based on their formulas. During those times I was not responding to anything, developed fistulas, and was found to have my UC progress to Crohn’s (or I may have had Crohn’s all along). I started taking Stelara and I feel great. My symptoms have improved to where I don’t think about them. I have my life back. I do take longer to get over respiratory infections and do have some joint pain, but I did also before Stelara so nothing new there. The one side effect I noticed is ringing in the ears sometimes. Stelara has changed my life.",Lobo

No other drug has helped unfortunately.  Chronic constipation, bloating and an inability to digest or process food has left me not really eating at all for the past 2 years.  I am hopefully this drug will give me a quality of life again but am also aware the side effects may become an issue.  The depression side of things may be interesting as I am bipolar...hopefully I'm covered there..Good luck to us all on our journey.",Lindy Loo
29,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,5.0,,"February 13, 2020",28,"Stelara was effective in the sense that it quickly healed my colon that had Crohn's disease. I would be thrilled except that after a few doses I developed horrible anxiety/depression, tinnitus and headaches. I have been on other biologics without these issues. I did not feel like myself anymore, so I chose to stop it because the negative outweighed the positive. Everyone responds differently.",Sunny3

31,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 15, 2019",54,I'm a Crohns survivor for 44 yrs. Tried all the old meds some new. Remicade worked best for 3 yrs and 6 MP for 4 yrs. Humira worked for 9 yrs but all symptoms returned. Stelara was my golden hope. First 8 months..nothing!Now one year after initial IV infusion...much better results...almost too good. Constipation is my norm. Painful gas constantly...bloating..exhaustion...and a simple head cold took forever to leave.Not sure I will continue this. Body aches and joint pain much worse. My main issues are constipation and exhaustion.I'd rather have diarrhea and a bit more energy. Very disappointed! Good luck Crohnies!!,Sicily

( usually 1 every 5 years.) I have been on Cimzia, Humira, steroids and lialda. I started Stelara in the summer of 2017, It stopped me from throwing up almost every time I ate, I still get cramping, but not nearly as painful as I did before.

38,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,8.0,,"April 7, 2019",87,"I am going into my 8th week post my initial IV infusion on Stelara and so far so good. I recently got diagnosed with small bowel fistulizing Crohns and my GI doctor and I decided that Stelara would be the best treatment option for me before trying any other option.  I experienced a decrease in abdominal cramping immediately after the initial treatment but the other symptoms persisted. At the 6 week mark all my Crohns symptoms decreased significantly. My appetite is back and I am putting on some weight, and I am having normal bowel movements. My chronic eye inflammation has also significantly decreased which makes me suspect that it is indeed Crohns related. I am only in the beginning stages of treatment but the impressive results makes me so hopeful and honestly has made me forget that I had Crohn's to begin with. No negative side effects so far but I did notice it has taken me way longer to get over a cold,  but nothing other than that. Praying that this continues to work for me!",Charlie

40,Stelara,Crohn's Disease,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 14, 2018",87,"Amazing drug that has put my Crohn's into remission!Humira, Remicade, Cimzia, Entyvio, 6mp, Lialda, all failed to work for any period of time. I have Fistulizing Crohn's and had 3 feet of resection 2 years ago. Two years on Stelara and I have my life back. I also changed my diet to the Mediteranean, avoiding simple sugars and eating only healthy food. Changing the gut microbiome along with finding the right medicine is key to controlling Crohn's. Much research now is pointing to the role of healthy gut microbiota. Stelara is so simple to inject with it's tiny syringe! Lower risk of serious side effects than other medicines in it's class!
