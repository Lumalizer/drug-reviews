0,Tacrolimus,Crohn's Disease,,,"July 7, 2018",3,tacrolimus has too many real side effects.  Would the doctor prescribe this to someone they love in their family?  I can't believe doctors prescribe this stuff to patients.  This stuff is bad. Period.,Sendy
1,Tacrolimus,Crohn's Disease,10.0,,"September 19, 2017",1,"I was in the original FDA FK506 study as a pre-transplant patient (Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis ).  I had been given 6 yrs to have a liver transplant.  My liver #'s were 3-4 digits and I was becoming very ill.  My dosage was stabilized at 3 mgs and my numbers have decreased to normal.  I have been on this medicine since 10 '92 and still no transplant.  The medicine has slowed the progress of PSC drastically.  I see it is used for Crohn's, but nothing is listed for liver diseases.  Did they ever evaluate the trial results from the early 90's?   My current insurance will not approve the drug for me for this reason.  This might be the result of the trial www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2982698/ or is a similar one.",Weavr
