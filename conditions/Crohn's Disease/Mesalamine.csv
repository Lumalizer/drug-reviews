1,Mesalamine,Crohn's Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 26, 2019",2,"Horrible reactions from three separate drugs with mesalamine in them, much worse than crohns flare ups  - Asacol, Pentasa and j can’t remember the other. Vomiting, diarrhea, I became so weak I couldn’t hold down food or liquids. While I went through the various treatments (Drug changes) I had to be hospitalized off and on and eventually I had to go on disability. Once I was off those drugs and with the help of steroids I became better.",Crohns887
2,Mesalamine,Crohn's Disease,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 25, 2019",11,"mesalamine was great for me. I could finally stop taking more aggressive treatments such as Humira or steroids. I like it because it has worked wonders. Been taking it for a year now, feel better than ever. I have not had any side effects. I feel like I can put Crohns in the back of my mind now. Hopefully for a while at least. Hope everyone reading this finds a treatment that works.",Anonymous

4,Mesalamine,Crohn's Disease,,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 23, 2018",7,Asacol HD (mesalamine):I feel that this medication is of a  big help to me. I have had crohns since 2004. I have good days and bad days more good than bad. I can not take any of the new treatments because I have two auto immune disorders. And I feel the risk is to high of bad side effects. I control my crohns with my diet and other otc meds that helps me deal with crohns better. The only problem I have is weight gain. I can not gain weight. Other than that I can live with it!,Bandido
5,Mesalamine,Crohn's Disease,,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 17, 2018",4,Asacol (mesalamine):Been taking this for 23 years - was doing quite well for a long time 4-6 x 400mg daily. No longer working - had bowel perforation and Chronic pains in large bowel and caecum. I've been on and off steriods for a year so trying azathioprine next week. Bloods returned anaemic low b12 so having injections also low TPMT - heterozygous ( Patients with low activity of TPMT are at a heightened risk of drug-induced bone marrow toxicity due to accumulation of the unmetabolised drug) so can only take low dose of aza.  It is important to get checked for this before you start azathioprine. Let’s hope it works !! Sick of being sick and struggling to work.,Ttra
6,Mesalamine,Crohn's Disease,,,"November 4, 2017",10,Lialda (mesalamine):Diagnosed with Crohn’s after routine Colonscopy 5/2017 and was started on Lialda. No symptoms of Crohn’s other than the discovery of ulcers during Colonscopy.Now having hair loss at temples and fear it will continue and/or get worse.Plus it’s not covered by my insurance and costs over $230.00 a month.My GI says if I don’t take it I risk getting colon cancer.I was basically told it’s better to be broke and bald than have colon cancer.I think there has to be another answer?,Urseka
7,Mesalamine,Crohn's Disease,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 20, 2017",3,"Apriso (mesalamine):71 y/o male, been on Apriso for 17 months.  Was on Asacol, PRN,  since 1st dx of ""Crohn's colititis""  in '03, refined to Crohn's, with stricture @ splenic flexure (caecum) in 2013.  In June drove 4000+ miles without butt cushion and have exacerbated hemorrhoids with minor bleeding X3 mos.  Saw anesthesia yesterday and ECG looked better than 40 years ago, but worried about H&H (rectal bleeding), liver and kidney enzymes (long terms NSAIDS) and C-reactive protein (indicative of autoimmune antecedents).  If labs are OK, will go next week for UGI endo (1st time), and bottom peek, with possible repair of hemis.  My Apriso co pay went from $47 to $169/mo.(donut hole) and I wonder if we might switch back to Asacol?",Boynurse
8,Mesalamine,Crohn's Disease,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 18, 2017",11,"Apriso (mesalamine):I started taking Apriso after being diagnosed with Crohn's August 2017. My Gastro doctor started me out on the ER capsules in the morning. I didn't really notice many side effects at first. I actually felt better than I've felt in years. Crohn's symptoms are almost completely gone, however, I still have a bad day every now and then. A few weeks in, I'm having horrible pounding headaches, dizzy when I stand from sitting, heart burn, excessive sweating, dry mouth, nausea, food taste metallic, and loss of appetite. I'm afraid if I stop this medication all the Crohn's issue will return. I would rate it a 5 because the med works if you can tolerate the side effects.",C.King
9,Mesalamine,Crohn's Disease,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 5, 2017",27,"Lialda (mesalamine):Ok not enough room on this review to put up my full history.  So will be brief.  :)  So far, tried Asacol and Humira and both did nothing for me.  Now I am on Lialda twice a day, 1.2GM tablets.   And these are working great.  No cramps and limiting me now to about 2 - 3 bowel movements a day.   And no bloody stools unlike my past.  (10 years diagnosis).  I have also changed my diet to a Mediterranean diet with little to no red meat.  Mainly chicken and fish for my sources of protein. No deep fried foods. And has worked out great.  Also for veggies/greens etc, skip out on any gas producing vegs (broccoli and onions for example). And taking vitamins/iron supplements daily to keep those well maintained.",Doing Better From TN

This medication has allowed me to live a normal life again...no more excruciating gut pain & no more daily  diarrhea.  I can actually eat at restaurants now, without worrying when the pain & diarrhea will hit me.  I have had no side effects from Pentasa.  It has given my life back to me.",a.jackie
