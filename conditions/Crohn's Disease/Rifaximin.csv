0,Rifaximin,Crohn's Disease,10,,"May 3, 2020",0,"I am 38yrs old, I have had bowel issues my whole life, diagnosed with  Crohns's diseas (CD) when I was 15.  I ended up having issues with SIBO 1.5 years ago and honestly felt hopeless as my symptoms worsened.  My skin was dull, breaking out, terrible gas, bloating and I was so tired I could barely function.  My naturopath is the one who finally told me about Rifaximin, my specialist refused to try me on it.  After discussing with my family doctor he finally agreed to prescribe it.  It is expensive- but I was willing to try anything at this point.  Within the first 24 hours I knew that it was working.  My dose was 550mg 3 times a day for four weeks.  I am currently into my second week.  I feel better than I have in years.  I am so thankful to have found this medication.  I did have headaches and some gas/pain on and off the first week.  Which is normal with die off.  My skin has cleared up and I feel normal again.   I hope that once I finish the medication that this continues.",EastCoastChic
1,Rifaximin,Crohn's Disease,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 21, 2019",3,"Experienced a Crohn's flare after 2 years remission and couldn’t leave my house for 4 days, finally went to my primary doctor since my GI doc didn’t have an appointment sooner and they Pdoc prescribed 60mg prednisone, it wasn’t helping much just minimized the pain and didn’t touch the other dreaded symptoms. I  remembered my GI doctor giving me Rifaximin two years ago and called my Primary doctor and asked for a prescription and 2 days later my pain is reduced by 80%, bowel movements are reduced from 10-20 a day to 3-5 and my energy is returning. I feel this plus the steroids working in tandem is making all the difference, I feel a lot better already and hopeful that I continue with this positive response as I did two years ago with this drug. Two years ago I felt like a normal person and stayed in remission this whole time, I have had a tremendous amount of stress lately and believe it brought on my flare. I’m glad to see that the rifamimin is helping other Crohn's sufferers as well and this is promising news.",Warrior 72

They tried the traditional medicine and added the rifaximin in a few days I could feel the difference I went from 6 pain pills a day to NONE AT ALL.  It gave me my life back I was hospitalized 3 times, I am now eating back to work and feeling like me again still have more surgery to go but the pain is gone a bowel movements are normal.  This drug is the best.",Tummy Ache
3,Rifaximin,Crohn's Disease,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 1, 2015",8,"Xifaxan (rifaximin):Turns out I jumped the gun in touting  xifaxan as a potential prednisone replacement for flare remission - at least on it's own. The initial symptomatic relief continued but hit a plateau, requiring the addition of a corticosteroid. So my Dr. additionally put me on entocort ec, but this flare remains stubborn. No longer willing to suffer, I requested prednisone. Day 3 and striking improvements. I will taper off the pred using entocort to reap the corticosteroid benefits while minimizing the nasty side-effects. But because Xifaxan is so well tolerated, I stayed on it and will continue - probably even after a hopefully successful taper off the pred and entocort. I'm curious as to whether Xifaxan can be used in conjunction with probiotics.",A - Train
4,Rifaximin,Crohn's Disease,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 15, 2015",15,"Xifaxan (rifaximin):I only just learned of Xifaxan after my 3.5 yr remission streak ended with a brutal flare. Desperately longing only for some pred, I was instead prescribed Xifaxan 550mg bid. But any disappointment faded on day 2 when I noticed it lowering the inflammation. Now I'm on day 5 and I'm impressed with this stuff. Pain is 80-90% lower and now eating normal meals without incident. I was on Flagyl for years but it never quieted a flare like Xifaxan is doing now. I may be able to tell prednisone good bye for ever.",A - Train
5,Rifaximin,Crohn's Disease,10,,"July 5, 2013",45,"Xifaxan (rifaximin):Xifaxin was the only medicine that was able to get me off steroids and into remission with my Crohn's disease. I had been on steroids for 2 years and had 2 surgeries for blockages. I took a two week course of this and within 3 days I was having normal bowel movements. Pain free after a week. Six months later I had another attack, took Xifaxin again with same results. In remission now for 3 years.",Krobar

First few days felt bad cramps but after that it felt like a complete cure. No bathroom trips, gained weight, I can eat anything without feeling bloated.",Anonymous
