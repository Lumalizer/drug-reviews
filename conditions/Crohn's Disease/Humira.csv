These include lesions, Fungal infections and muscle weakness in her arms and legs which I attribute to nerve damage. Her specialist witnesses these conditions and refuses to acknowledge them and continues to push the advantages of this drug. This is total incompetence and proof that Drs care more about their kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies than caring for their patients. This drug should be for short term to control flare ups and not be seen as a long term solution.",Alm

Humira suppressed by immune system significantly. I would get sick so easily. I also believe I have permanent nerve damage to my arms because of the humira. When I was on humira my joints and bone were so stiff, I felt like a 90 year old woman in a 19 year old body. I am now 27 and have been off humira for 6 years and feel significantly better. I am now on Entivyo and my immune is not as suppressed. I personally will never use humira again.",Anonymous

Your doctor won't tell you this, but, if you have any issues with the Humira, your doctor, your pharmacy, and the manufacturer will not assist you. For example, if the pen becomes damaged or it's accidentally left out of the refrigerator and becomes ineffective, the manufacturer will not send you a replacement. Your doctor will tell you that it's expensive and that they don't have any samples. Things happen in life and you pen could become affected. There is no safety net. You will have to tough it out until the next shipment arrives, which could be two weeks later. It happened to me.",Anonymous

I had my colonoscopy June 2020 and the doctor said  things were better but he feels I need something stronger and wants me to to Entyvio which is a 1/2 hour infusion treatment.
