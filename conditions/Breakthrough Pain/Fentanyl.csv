I continue to battle Esophageal cancer, have had a full Esophagectomy & a thoracotomy on each side. This drug works within 2 minutes, doesn’t present any side effects & allows me to complete many tasks I couldn’t do without this medication. The cost is outrageous; however, Medicare and USPF provide an unbelievable level of support to me financially!",JRC_1962
2,Fentanyl,Breakthrough Pain,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 23, 2017",25,"Actiq (fentanyl):4 major back surgeries. ALL failed to relieve severe chronic pain.

Finally diagnoses Severely Permanent Damage to Nerves & Discs (3 removed, 2 destroyed) in Sacroliliac & upward area containing Nerve & Disc Damage that cannot be resolved with Surgery, ""Failed back surgery & Severe Chronic pain syndrome."" High natural resistance to opiates since a child, made worse by tolerance to opiates at a faster than normal rate. During the 20 + years of severe chronic pain, the intro. of Aqtiq was pivotal.

The withdrawal symptoms are awful and the NHS do not know how to treat patients withdrawing from this. It should be used at end of life or for in patients only.",abstraluser
4,Fentanyl,Breakthrough Pain,10.0,,"September 16, 2016",33,"Actiq (fentanyl):Used several years ago.  I was prescribed the fentanyl patch for 72 hrs (3) days.  Actiq was prescribed for breakthrough pain.  What a God-send!  Finally research supported that people have differing degrees of metabolism and my patch was changed to every 48 hours.  Still. fentanyl in patch for around the clock pain control WITH the Actiq Lollipop-type medication for ""breakthrough"" pain was a life savior.  I  was a mother of 3 boys with the severest form of neck, back and fibromylagia putting my pain level off the charts.  This med allowed me (after taking a dose of Actiq) to 1) go grocery shopping, 2)take, pick-up and volunteer for a whole hour, 3) cook dinner and go to church and lastly, 4)participate in activities lasting 1 hr.",Donna Pain Controlled W/Actiq&
5,Fentanyl,Breakthrough Pain,6.0,,"September 8, 2016",12,Subsys (fentanyl):I had pelvic surgery from the best uro/ gyn surgeon in the Houston area. He royally meshed up my surgery leaving me with pelvic anuryzm. My pain is at 10+/24-7 without meds. I have not found any meds that would bring the pain below a 7 before I found Subsys. My only issue with Subsys is it only last 3hrs......never more. My Dr. Has me on 800mcg.  He is very careful and will not increase it.  Subsys is great....it's just not a free for all.,Diane D.

7,Fentanyl,Breakthrough Pain,10.0,,"May 9, 2016",27,"Subsys (fentanyl):I was given Subsys as a replacement for 30mg instant release OxyContin. 800mcg 4x per day instead of 4x 30mg OxyContin. My usual opiate regimen is 3x 80mg OxyContin, which has been at this level for 16 years now. Combined with the 4x 800mcg Subsys my pain is controlled more than ever has been (since 1990 when it began), but the dosage is so strict that there are times when I have to live with unbearable break through pain for up to 8 hours. Is my pain under control? Yes, but I live with a pain level of 7-7.5 24/7/365. Without Subsys my pain would be unbearable.",KosmoInNYC
8,Fentanyl,Breakthrough Pain,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 25, 2015",30,"Abstral (fentanyl):I was enrolled in a clinical trial for abstral 7 months ago. This worked well for me so my pain doc started giving it to me. Now my doc is being told I am not allowed to use it because I don't have a diagnosis of cancer. I have lupus, fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis which are quite debilitating most of the time. If I am not having a lupus flare up, I'm having a fibromyalgia flare up or a RA flare up, so I never know when I'm going to have a hard day or a good day. I don't wish for cancer but I do wish the pharmaceutical companies would realize that cancer patients area to the only ones in chronic breakthrough pain. Abstral works well and works in five to eight minutes. ",Puddles614
9,Fentanyl,Breakthrough Pain,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 15, 2015",18,Subsys (fentanyl):Works in just a few minutes. I like the spray in place of the Fentanyl sub-lingual tabs. I like Sub-Sys made by INSYS Pharm. I know I have been on these type med's for 20  yrs.,King O' Pain
10,Fentanyl,Breakthrough Pain,9.0,,"October 23, 2014",24,"Actiq (fentanyl):Mostly good but my pain would be worse at night when trying to sleep. I would take a dose and due to the 20 minute time to dissolve properly, I sometimes fell asleep with it still in my mouth which over time has done massive damage to my teeth nearby the cheeks in every quadrant of the mouth. The dental work required is in the ten thousand dollar range which I can't hope to afford. As a mid aged man who is divorced, this causes problems with the ladies and I don't blame them.",Jack11186

12,Fentanyl,Breakthrough Pain,9.0,,"September 4, 2014",21,Subsys (fentanyl):My PCP doc had increased the amount of Oxycontin I take from 2 to 3 a day when they changed the formula in order to get the same amount of relief. The down side was he said I was maxed out on my pain meds now and took away my meds for break through pain. He suggested seeing a pain management doctor after a car accident that was making break through pain unbearable. The pain doc started me on a P-STIM and wanted me to try the Subsys. With such severe pain I agreed to it. I will never look back at my decision to try it as it has been a life saver for me and will take my pain from a 10 to a 2 very quickly. The only set back I can see is you have to wait a 1/2 hour before you can do another spray.,Dave 52
13,Fentanyl,Breakthrough Pain,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 12, 2014",45,"Subsys (fentanyl):I was prescribed Subsys after being on the fentanyl patch for 6 months, 100 every 48 hours and as my cancer progressed and treatments happened, which caused more pain, I needed something for breakthrough pain really bad, I would be put down to my knees from the pain and just lay in my bed moaning like a child but Subsys works within minutes, eases the pain where I can feel it just literally fade away. I'd be in a wheelchair without it, or bedridden. ",Almost free

It gets so bad as to completely debilitate me where I am unable to stand, sit for long periods of time and walk up or down stairs.  This medication is life saving for me.  It has allowed me to return my functioning so that I am mobile again.  I can walk up stairs, work out for short periods of time and live a fairly functional life were I can go to the store, walk around and attend family functions.",podoc

20,Fentanyl,Breakthrough Pain,9.0,,"May 30, 2010",38,Actiq (fentanyl):I have used fentanyl for about one year for breakthrough pain when using Embeda or 120mg of oxycodone as the primary medication. Actiq works extremely fast and quickly takes down the pain and related panic. I can also easily moderate the amount of fentanyl by removing the lollipop once pain relief has been achieved thus avoiding overuse. I do not get the typical drowsiness of narcotics from fentanyl. My only complaint is that it is relatively short acting and usually worn off at about 2.5 to 3 hours. As a result I often have to use a less effective medication for breakthrough pain and need to ration the fentanyl.,Jewelie
21,Fentanyl,Breakthrough Pain,6.0,,"April 25, 2010",17,"Actiq (fentanyl):I was essentially mis-prescribed Actiq when I should have been getting fentanyl patches for my cancer pain.  This caused problems with both bolus dosing (transient overdosage) and build-up of opioid tolerance with the Actiq that have not been nearly as great a problem with fentanyl patches.Other patients may have different experiences; however for chronic cancer pain, the patches might be considered before use of Actiq.",loupgarous
22,Fentanyl,Breakthrough Pain,10.0,,"February 8, 2010",43,"Fentora (fentanyl):I have used Fentora for breakthrough pain due to RSD which is a nerve disorder.  The medication when I can take it makes a huge difference in my daily routine.  Unfortunately the last 2 years my current insurance will not pay for it so my family has been paying for it.  Initially we paid $4000.00/month which quickly became impossible.  I am currently taking 1/4 of my daily dose I should be on.

26,Fentanyl,Breakthrough Pain,8.0,,"February 27, 2009",75,Duragesic (fentanyl):I was in a terrible car accident and kept having chronic back pain. I finally found out I had herniated L4 and L5 in my lower back. I was given so many different medicines by my pain management doctors. Nothing was working not even the epidural steroid shots until I was put on duragesic. I have been on them for 3 years and I wear two patches I am on 125mcg. I was basically almost hopeless till I was put on fentanyl. Now I have never felt better at 27 and a single mother of a five year old I could not afford to be in the pain I was in. I wear the patches every 48 hours and I still have break through medicines. I'm thankful for this miracle drug.,dugit

The relief from Actiq has been virtually miraculous. It takes effect within minutes and it doesn't make me feel as medicated as I did with Vicoden.One of the best things about Actiq is that I can regulate the amount of medication to match my break through pain level. I don't have to take a pill, wait 45 minutes then realize that it isn't working. Take yet another pill and (another) 45 minutes later realize that I am over-medicated relative to my pain.When my doctor asked me how I was getting on with the Actiq, my answer was ""Actiq gave me my life back.""",Anonymous

With this I feel as good as I did 13 years ago before I became disabled. Use responsibly as your doctor prescribes. This is by far the most relief I've ever had.,blant88
