So far, only mild hot flashes and maybe a knee twinge a couple times [and I had problems with knee tendons previously].  I walk 1-2 miles/day and work out with light weights and so far have had no problems with either.  I already had mild osteoporosis and had another baseline DXA scan prior to starting anastrozole [the generic name for Arimidex].

Side effects like everyone else is the bone and muscle pain, hot flashes, insomnia and just Now taking B-6 for the muscles, vitamin D and Calcium for the bones and a probiotic for the stomach/gastro issues. Bought a new bed, see a chiropractor once a month, etc.  So many life changes just to be able to tolerate this med. As a person with high blood pressure to start with and on a HBP med, about 10 months in my BP started to climb.  I was doing all the same things everyday.  Walking, green tea, beet juice, limiting caffeine and alcohol and by the time I was 11 months in it was 179/109.  Stopped the arimidex for 2 weeks and its down to 135/81.  I am NOT crazy...I really think it is increasing my blood pressure. Going to start the arimdex again for a week and see what happens. Hoping for the best!

The last 6 months of the 5 years on anastrozole I began to have hip and back pain. I stopped taking it October 1st and today is November 18th. I want to get back to my daily walk but have not been able to due to the difficulty walking. I do still walk the dog at night but it isn't easy. I have tried stretching and in some cases I felt it aggravated it. I even limp some days. It is very discouraging. I am taking 1 aleve morning and night but don't really like doing that either. I am hoping it gets better enough to walk which may make me feel better. I am 60 yrs old.,Lab Lover

7,Arimidex,Breast Cancer,2.0,,"November 7, 2019",144,"I took it for 5 years and just stopped on October 31st.  This drug is TERRIBLE.  It destroys your bones, causes hip joint pain so bad that you lose your balance, causes hot flashes,  night sweats,  insomnia,  constipation,  heart palpitations,  spinal pain, loss of bone density which causes OSTEOPENIA which can lead to OSTEOPOROSIS  and more. Its disgusting that this is basically the only one you can take other than tamoxifen. Your oncologist SHOULD tell you what the side effects are going to do so that you can somehow prepare for them.  Mine prescribed  GABAPENTIN for the hot flashes,  night sweats and insomnia. Arimidex has to be taken for only 5 years and no more.  Hopefully the weakness in my hip joints will ease,  the pain in my bones, the constipation, heart palpitations. You will never get back the bone loss.
