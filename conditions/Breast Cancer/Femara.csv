0,Femara,Breast Cancer,4.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 24, 2021",2,"Took Femara for 2 years+.  Just saw my oncologist recently and she asked about the joint pain.  It has been awful, my joint and muscle pain is excruciating sometimes.  I am a young 61 who felt 85.  No more snow skiing.  Could barely get out of bed many days. Oncologist suggested I take a week off of it and if it improved the pain, she would prescribe Aromasin.  Sure enough, pain all gone and now have been on Aromasin a week.  Fingers crossed!",Inis
1,Femara,Breast Cancer,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 9, 2021",2,"Male had breast cancer removed. Lymph nodes clear, but started on this after I had a bad MRI for an eye issue. Started taking letrozole as insurance. Recently have been having more brain fog, unexplained black eye, yellow bruises on legs, and one on my arm.  Will probably stop taking.  Also just diagnosed with glaucoma like someone else here. Good luck. It seems this drug works for many, and doesn't fit for a lot too. Make up your own mind for what is best for you. Good luck.",Concerned
2,Femara,Breast Cancer,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 16, 2021",13,"I was prescribed Letrozole by the Oncologist after breast cancer surgery.  Exactly one year on this medication I started having arthritis, which progressed to full blown Rheumatoid Arthritis.  The Oncologist refused to acknowledge a link, and insisted I stay on the medication for five years. Common sense told me that the medication interfered with my immune system. I will be on medication for the rest of my life, to control the RA, taking injections every three weeks. I am positive it is connected to the Letrozole.",Therese

6,Femara,Breast Cancer,10.0,,"May 15, 2017",136,"I've been taking Femara for a little over 5 months and have yet to experience any side effects whatsoever. I'd been warned about hot flashes, night sweats, joint pain, muscle pain, and so far nothing. I have two smallish tumors in one breast that we caught very early on, and at my 4 month ultrasound they've decreased by about 50%. I'll have a nipple-sparing mastectomy in about 2 weeks with DIEM flap reconstruction...the grossest part of this whole episode in my opinion...followed by radiation. No chemo here, just a very healthy mostly vegetarian diet and tons of walking. I'm 69, 5'6"", 135, and so far consider myself about the luckiest cancer patient anywhere. Maybe I'll start feeling sick at some point but not yet. Hang in there ladies!!",Smittie

No radiation or chemo.  I'm 58 & this is the only drug I take, besides vitamins.  The first 6 weeks I had trouble sleeping, occasional dizziness, some joint pain, & mild headaches.  Around 4 months in, I started losing hair.  I'd guess approximately 25% of my hair has fallen out.  Besides the hair loss, I have dry eyes, genitals, & skin.  There's some stiffness & joint pain in my hips.  These side effects are tolerable, especially, knowing that the drug is preventing a cancer recurrence.  None of these side effects are enough for me to stop taking letrozole!",Shorty!

10,Femara,Breast Cancer,2.0,,"March 21, 2016",79,"I have been on this drug for about 3.5 months now. I was on Aromasin (exemestane) for 2/5 years prior to starting letrozole. I was so hopeful that some of the horrible side effects would not affect me like they did on the exemestane...and for a while, it was not too bad. Now, in month 3, the side effects of severe joint pain, brain fog and shortness of breath are back with a vengeance and the last 3 times my blood pressure was taken, it was inching back up even though I started BP meds after the exemestane raised my BP. I never had any issues with my BP prior to taking these aromatase inhibitors. I guess my PCP will have to raise my dose of BP meds. I am also peeing constantly on letrozole and my hair is coming out more on my brush! UGH!",april485

14,Femara,Breast Cancer,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 21, 2015",83,"I have been taking Letrozole for one year now after a diagnosis of hormone related breast cancer. Initially my consultant (UK) said I would need a right sided mastectomy.  However two weeks later when the biopsy results were back he said he did not think surgery was possible because the tumour appeared to be attached to the muscle.  However, CT scan and MRI revealed a 1mm plane between the tumour and the muscle - phew!  Letrozole was so effective that it shrank and softened the tumour and by January 2015 I was able to have a bilateral mastectomy.  Lymph glands and bone scan were clear.Side effects:  persistent hot flashes, so I always wear blouses with buttons and carry an ordinary fan in my handbag; it is a life saver.",Crystalsea

I was put on tamoxifen for a year and then femara which I currently take now. The biggest thing with femara is being like I am constantly tired and ""foggy"" - I can handle the hot flashes ( we live in Minnesota - where the winter lasts for 6 months) - I just walk around outside with a t shirt on and I'm good to go!  Lately, I have been experiencing hair loss and I don't know if its due to the femara?  Anyone else have this problem?  Please let me know.  Hang in there beautiful ladies (& men)",minnesota mama lu

I had muscle pain and was very emotional and horrible periarea dryness. I would cry about anything. These symptoms have pretty much gone away after day 4. Now after a month, my main side effects seem to be evening fatigue (I would really like to go to bed at 6:30pm) and fuzzy thinking. During the first couple of days of taking this medicine I had my doubts if I would continue, but now I think with time I will find ways to work around the side effects. They really aren't that bothersome.",Anonymous
18,Femara,Breast Cancer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 26, 2015",174,"Had Grade A Breast Cancer that was caught early.  Had a mass and one lymph node removed.  Went on Femara on Nov. 8, 2014, the day after I finished radiation.  At first, I didn't notice anything.  Slowly the pain in my feet started, then other joints in my body.  I felt like I was having trouble getting air into my lungs.  I started feeling like I was in a fog.  I already had been diagnosed with depression years ago which was under control with medication.  I started experiencing depression a couple of weeks ago which included waking up and crying.  That turned into suicidal depression.  Without pain medication, I couldn't move around well.  The bottom of my feet were killing me. I work full time. I quit the Femara 2 days ago.",Chille Hille

My doctor then put me on brand name Femara and the joint pain, head pain, and trigger finger all went away.  What is bothering me now is the hair loss (can see my scalp!), memory loss--constantly groping for words.  Sometimes I do feel like I'm ""foggy"" but mostly I just can't remember words.

In beginning, I experienced nausea and diarrhea.  As this went away, the bone and joint pain began.  I would be awakened from my sleep in tears, as my hips would ache just from lying in bed.  My hands/fingers hurt to make a fist, or do any type of extended writing.  My knees ache horribly.  When I get out of bed in the morning, I need to stand still for at least 2 or 3 minutes until I can get my legs to work.  Same thing when sitting for any length of time.

My hair regrowth was pretty quick but began thinning significantly after about a year of Tamoxifen usage (could see my scalp pretty clearly in the front and on top of my head).  My doctor switched me to Femara about 2 months ago - side effects include lots of hot flashes (about 6-10 daily) and weight gain which I am combating by working out everyday and cutting my calories.

Was started on Effexor with nearly immediate relief. Have had increasingly painful joint and muscle pain, especially in my knees. Nothing seems to be helping much with that and it has been a major detriment to my quality of life. Have recently added Magnesium, Fish Oil and Glucosamine/Chrondroitin to the Calcium and D3 I had been taking. Hopefully this will ease the joint stiffness and pain. I am 52 and some days feel 92.

However it is what it is and we must continue to take. So, I decided to fight the effect, dry vagina improved with a non hormonal lubricant. For joint pain, fish oil, magnesium, zinc and calcium twice a day, big improvement. Also each morning no matter how stiff you are, go walking, it warms up the joints and gets you going for the rest of the day. I also do weights 3 times a week to increase muscle to protect bones.  All have made big a difference. No weight gain. Vitamins have certainly helped keep hair and skin in good condition. Three more years of it so it's best to just keep trying to counteract the negative effects.",noosa

I have so much energy I don't know what to do with it.  I don't gain weight either, and my muscle pain is usually gone after a brief stretch or walk.

30,Femara,Breast Cancer,8.0,,"September 7, 2010",159,"I'm 4 years status post breast CA and doing well... no recurrence for my Stage IIIA.  I started taking tamoxifen, then my oncologist switched me to Femara.  I do have frequent hot flashes ((whew!) and joint and bone pain that worsens with being tired.  Overall, I am able to tolerate the medication, and my oncologist believes it is the treatment of choice for me.  The side effects of being without estrogen are worse than the Femara side effects.  I know the drug is working as having no estrogen produced results in atrophic vaginitis, decreased sex drive, and other female issues that are bothersome.  But, in the big picture of life, it's a small price to pay to be, and hopefully stay, cancer free.  I will continue to use Femara!",SusanLea

I was on it for about 3 months when I awoke in the middle of the night with horrible joint pain,  It had been coming on slowly, but I thought it was carpel tunnel, maybe arthritis. Then I realized that my doctor had said that joint pain was a possible side effect of Femara.  I was also gaining approximately 2 pounds a month! I have been off of it for a month now, but am still having pain.  It is worse in the mornings and evenings.  Trying to grip with my hands is very difficult some mornings.

In the mornings I cannot get out of bed. I take thyroid medicine in the morning and cannot open the bottle. It takes about 20 minutes before I can close my fingers or bend my toes. Nighttime is also bad. After sitting for short periods I cannot get up. I have never felt better in my life except for the constant agonizing pain.
