0,Xeloda,Breast Cancer,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 22, 2021",5,I have HER2 neu positive and BRCA gene mutation associated with triple breast cancer diagnosis. Iâ€™ve been on capecitabine for several months. First series of treatments lasted 2 months before neuropathy and skin peeling began on hands and feet. Mouth sores and acne around mouth area was pretty severe. Stopped treatment for 4 weeks and skin fluffing subsided. Adjusted a different medication I was taking with the capecitabine and started back on treatment. Within 4 weeks hand and feet issues started again. May need to decrease dosage.,missrozita
1,Xeloda,Breast Cancer,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 20, 2020",17,I took it the during the 3rd year after my diagnosis.  It worked great for about 11 months and then it didn't.  But I was struggling with extreme fatigue before I started taking it and within the first week I felt so much better.  Other than fatigue i didn't have any side effects.  It was great,Old Woman
2,Xeloda,Breast Cancer,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 10, 2016",23,"Xeloda has brought my tm's down slowly but consistently. However, when I changed to the Mylan brand ( insurance made me switch to the Accredo mail order)I had a horrible experience after one cycle. The other products/binders in this brand included lactose and a combination similar to Miralax. I became lactose intolerant and dehydrated due to severe diarrhea. Also had severe myalgia and arthralgia.I am now back on the Teva brand and seem to be doing well.",Lizzie5
