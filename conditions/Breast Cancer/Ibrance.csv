1,Ibrance,Breast Cancer,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 20, 2020",13,I loved it.  It was the first drug I tried after I was diagnosed.  I had not had a mammogram for 3 years so my original diagnosis was Stage 4.  This drug worked like a charm.  Brought my numbers down really low and I felt good.  Except for fatigue.  But they all effect me that way.  My husband was dying of COPD and I took care of him until the end.  Great drug.,Old Woman
