There are positive experiences using anastrazole. I'm not sure why so many have side-effects. I am now 65 years old, and otherwise very good health.",Kate K.
2,Anastrozole,Breast Cancer,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2022",0,"The thought of taking this medication scared the dickens out of me based upon the reviews here.  I chose to give it a try knowing the decision to stop was also mine.   I was age 68 and now 69, lumpectomy, targeted radiation, not in lymphs.  The first few days I experienced headache and joint discomfort.  Then both stopped.  Activity matters.  I was active prior to diagnosis and treatment and have increased my activity level since beginning this medication in mid October 2021.  I walk 3-4 miles daily, bike (on trainer during winter), 15 daily flights of stairs and swim (when I'm able).   I found that I can limit my activity a couple days each week but if those days are two in a row I begin to feel bone and joint pain.  Then I kick my activity back into higher gear and no longer go light two days in a row.  This is my lifestyle for now and probably forever.  I pray for positive long term outcomes and good quality of life for us all.",Bertie

As with most of these ladies, I experienced crippling leg, hip, thigh, joint pain. Also serious issues with fatigue. For what it’s worth my daughter bought me good quality CBD oil to try to help. Help it certainly did. Within two days I was without pain of any description in my legs, hips and other joints. I am still taking it and will do until I can stop taking Anastrozole. I’m not advocating CBD oil as I’m not medically qualified, I just think I should share the effects it had on me as I know how bloody miserable Anastrozole can make you feel. Do your own research, talk to your doctor ( if you can!) and maybe try it yourself. I use the 1200 mg, 4 sprays per day. I hope this helps someone.",Gran

11,Anastrozole,Breast Cancer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 9, 2021",4,"I took this drug because my oncologist felt it would reduce my cancer risk.

I experienced unexplainable sweating, increase in blood pressure, over all itching, headaches, joint/bone pain, insomnia and mood swings that were bad. I am post menopausal. I expected some side effects but after 31 days and an emergency room visit enough was enough. I weigh the value of medication based on cost vs benefit. Yes, I am risking developing cancer but I am comfortable in the monitoring I will be under that an annual breast MRI and mammogram which provides me with being monitored every 6 months.
