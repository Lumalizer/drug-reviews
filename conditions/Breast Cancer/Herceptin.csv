0,Herceptin,Breast Cancer,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 15, 2022",0,"Where do I start? Severe fatigue, severe shortness of breath, rash, mouth sores, back pain, joint pain, irritability, anxiety, depression, change in taste, loss of appetite. I can keep going. What did people do before this drug, who are still alive? My first infusion almost threw me in the hospital from an allergic reaction.  I know it’s supposed to be a life saver and prevent recurrence even though it doesn’t cross the blood brain barrier.  I wish they could’ve come up with a drug without the severe side effects. I am not sure if Im able to continue treatment. My quality of life is diminished. Doctors just promote and never listen.",Lisa

2,Herceptin,Breast Cancer,10,,"January 24, 2010",61,"I did 7 months of treatment then my Oncologist had to take me off due to Congestive Heart Failure. I personally don't think Herceptin contributed to it at all but was told it was the combo of it and Adryamyacin. It was pretty bad, my ejection fraction was down to 28. I was so short of breath that just walking to the bathroom was a real effort. The fatigue was the mind numbing kind that just turning over in bed felt like I had ran a race. As for side effects for the Herceptin, I had frequent nose bleeds, mild nausea and occasional headaches. I would have gladly endured any side effects for the benefits of this life-saving drug. I am so thankful to Dr Slamon for all the work he did and to Genetech. I am a 4 year survivor so I think that says it all.",itsme1972
