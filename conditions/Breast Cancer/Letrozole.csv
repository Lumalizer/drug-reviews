0,Letrozole,Breast Cancer,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 21, 2021",1,I took Letrozole for 15 months. I had developed very bad asthma. Both my Oncologist and Specialist Physician were treating me. No cause could be found and more medication was added. Suddenly one day I wondered if it could possibly be the Letrozole. I decided to stop taking it  but didn't tell anybody. I was amazed that from the first day of stopping I didn't have any asthma attack. 2 weeks later and still no attacks I told my Physician what I'd done. I surely can't be the only person who has developed asthma from Letrozole. Why is it not listed in the side effects,Friendship

It has been awful, my joint and muscle pain is excruciating sometimes.  I am a young 61 who felt 85.  No more snow skiing.  Could barely get out of bed many days. Oncologist suggested I take a week off of it and if it improved the pain, she would prescribe Aromasin.  Sure enough, pain all gone and now have been on Aromasin a week.  Fingers crossed!",Inis

5,Letrozole,Breast Cancer,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 7, 2021",0,I took this med for 6 months.  Around 6 month mark I got Carpel Tunnel in both hands.  I literally could not use my hands or bend my fingers.  My hands were so sore and swollen.  I had to get steroid injections in my wrists to alleviate the pain.  My Dr. just switched me to aromasin.  We will give that a try and see if its better. I would not take Letrozole again.,Steffie

Gradually I noticed a stiffening in my joints: knees. hips, shoulders, ankles. Eventually I couldn’t get out of bed. I stopped EVERYTHING for one week and felt better. My oncologist switched me back to tamoxifen. After 4 weeks I can move again. Of course the hot flashes returned with tamoxifen. Two more weeks and I visit the oncologist to discuss options- I am so happy I can walk again.",Molly987654321
7,Letrozole,Breast Cancer,5.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 31, 2021",2,Had stage 1 breast cancer in January 2015 started on tamoxifen. Oncologist had me switch in 2017 to letrozole. Have wet macular degeneration. I am being treated for that with injections. I have been having lots of joint pain. Now I have noticed I had a Dexa in 2019 and now in 2021 have been diagnosed with osteoporosis. So since the beginning of the 2021 year I have started to become a hot mess. Talked to my oncologist and we now are stopping letrozole. I have had over 5 years of drugs. I feel the side effects of the drugs are damaging that you sometimes have to wonder is it worth it. At 61 I am extremely active walk between 8-10 miles during the week at work along with 3 sets of steps 3 times daily. I also exercise at night when I get home. Hope they can somehow work to improve these drugs.,JFitz95
8,Letrozole,Breast Cancer,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 22, 2021",7,Has anyone had eye problems with Letrozole.  I've been on it about a year and a half.  Every so often I can't see out of my right eye at all and the color is a deep maroon.....very scary.  My retina doctor said there was no bleeding.  I have wet macular degenration in the right eye and I read Letrozole can cause the pulling of the vitreous in the eye on the retina causing the retina to change your vision and also small retina hermorrhages.  I'm so afraid of losing my vision.  Has anyone ever had this happen to them?  Does anyone know if there are other safer options to prevent my Stage 1 breast cancer from coming back other than Letrozole?,newhouse1

I will be on medication for the rest of my life, to control the RA, taking injections every three weeks. I am positive it is connected to the Letrozole.",Therese

For about 3 years prior to the surgery, I had problems with back pain, lack of energy, depression and asthma which caused me to be very short winded. Since the radiation I find I'm more tired and the breathing is worse.  I wake up tired, I go to bed tired. The Letrozole has caused sweats & hot flashes worse than ever before. I wake up with excruciating joint pain every day so bad that it feels as though my wrists, fingers or arms are broken. During the night my hips ache so that I have to turn on my back. Also causing hair loss. I'm on oxycodone so once I get up and take the pain killers the joint pain goes away.

When I first started, I had no side effects whatsoever. My oncologist couldn't believe it. Then after six months, my pharmacy switched brands and I began getting hives and severe joint pain; the new brand they were giving me was from Teva. I recently asked them if they could still get the brand (Breckenridge) that they had originally given me and they said yes. I'm now taking that one again. No hives, although I do still have some lingering joint pain. I've had the same experience on a couple other meds I take, i.e., when my pharmacy switches brands I've had problems.

The cramping that I experience in my legs now is not nearly as severe and is doable. I've been on the Letrozole about a year and a half now. I'm writing because I wanted to let you know that if you are experiencing hair thinning while on Letrozole, I have found that taking a B-complex vitamin pill on a daily basis has been very helpful for me.

For joint pain, fish oil, magnesium, zinc and calcium twice a day, big improvement. Also each morning no matter how stiff you are, go walking, it warms up the joints and gets you going for the rest of the day. I also do weights 3 times a week to increase muscle to protect bones.  All have made big a difference. No weight gain. Vitamins have certainly helped keep hair and skin in good condition.

Overall, I am able to tolerate the medication, and my oncologist believes it is the treatment of choice for me.  The side effects of being without estrogen are worse than the Femara side effects.  I know the drug is working as having no estrogen produced results in atrophic vaginitis, decreased sex drive, and other female issues that are bothersome.
