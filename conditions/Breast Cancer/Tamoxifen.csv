25,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer,1.0,,"September 12, 2018",49,I took Tamoxifen for 3 years.  I took myself off of it because of the painful side effects.  They began within 3-4 months after starting the med. The worse for me was the bone pain that would be so severe that it would wake me up during the night.  Also the severe pelvic pain would be so severe at times it would literally bring me to my knees suddenly. I eventually took myself off the Tamoxifen and within a few weeks all side effects were gone. Within a few months I started to fracture bones and developed osteopenia.  5 years later I am borderline osteoporosis and the cancer never really left.  Someone  mentioned having pain in their jaw.  Now they want me to take Tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor again.  I am considering taking one of the above only 2-3 days a week.

48,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer,6.0,,"September 14, 2015",61,"I have been on Tamoxefin for 40 days...  Here's my story:  I was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer (98% estrogen fed) in Alr 2015.  I did not need chemo or radiation.  I was told after surgery (June 2015) that I had to take ""Tomy"" for 5 years. I fought the idea, but eventually decided to give it a try.  So far, the main complaint I have is fatigue.  I take it at night and that's helps...  Some joint pain, vaginal discharge (clear mostly) and the BEST thing about Tommy is that it has calms me down.  I am about 30% of the energized person I was before.  I no longer get feel like I need to solve the worlds problems in a day!  So, I can honesty say, that's a big plus! ...   WEIGHT CHANGES:  I became Vegan and did not loose any weight! :((",Tough girl proven wrong
49,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer,4.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 13, 2015",39,I have been on tamoxifen for almost a year now. I experience hot flashes. Which can be unbearable at times.

50,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 24, 2015",97,"I started taking Tamoxifen in September of 2013. The side effects kicked in after about a week. My fingers completely seized up and if I crouched down I couldn't get up again! The joint pain was unbearable so my oncologist decided to take me off it for 6 months. He then introduced it gradually, 10mg a day instead of 20mg. So far so good! After 6 months of that he put me back up to the full dose and the pain didn't return! I've been on it ever since. My periods are here and there but are quite heavy and painful when I do get them. I wish they'd just stop. Just keeping everything crossed that the cancer stays away. Good luck to all you fellow survivors and keep fighting the fight! ",Neekie
51,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 16, 2015",135,I've been on this drug for nine miserable months now.  I had said I would try it for one year and I'm not sure I can make that.  It appears that quality of life is not something my doctor cares about.  It's almost as if he's being paid by the tamoxifen people because he won't even listen to anything negative about the drug.  My hot flashes are unbelievable.  My joint pain makes it difficult to walk.  I haven't slept in nearly a year.  This drug makes life not worth living.,I hate Tamoxifen
52,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer,7.0,,"July 27, 2015",60,"I had Stage 1 IDC Breast Cancer, diagnosed in June 2013, mastectomies in August 2013, started tamoxifen October 2013.  After experiencing stomach digestive issues I went off it in March 2014 until August, then back on and have been on it ever since.  So almost 1 year straight, but another 5 months of it before that as well.  My biggest complaint is feeling so wiped out by the end of the day.  I take it at night when going to bed, usually 10pm-ish.  Does anyone think switching the time I take the pill will matter?  I have also noticed a 5-10 pound weight gain.  I'm very active and fit - lift weights, run, do crossfit.  I have found that the side effects of this drug are forcing me to live and eat cleaner to try and reduce them.",CarrieFitz
53,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 21, 2015",83,"I have male breast cancer. I do find it uncomfortable to only read about ladies issues, but understandable. I have found that I feel depressed, and mood swings for sure. Upset tummy is common, so try to keep hydrated. Seem to get lethargic, tired around 3-5pm, but take my medication just before bed, 10-11pm. May consider changing this. Given the alternatives and worrying how my family would cope without me as the bread winner, makes the decision to continue to take it an easy one. I am not going to give in to it. I'm 59,  and lost my brother to it aged 39. Played my first 70 min game of tennis today in 14 months, and really found it made a difference. So maybe keeping fit is one way of fighting back.",Silverfox 2
54,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 19, 2015",94,"I've been on Tamoxifen for a year now.  A few joint aches but all in all not too many problems.  When I started the medicine I was a Pescitarian( only at fish or seafood)  I have maybe two hot flashes at night.  I take my pill at 5pm daily.  I too was told I need to be on it for 10 years.  Considering the alternative, I don't have too many bad things to say about it.  Glad to be cancer free!!  Hope this keeps me that way.  Turning 50 in three days!!",Jillbean34
55,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer,7.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 23, 2014",145,"I'm on my 6th year taking Tamoxifen. I was on it for 5 years, and stopped - at that time it was thought I should only take it for 5yrs. A year after being off and the new research came out that I should do it another 5 years. I've been back on now for about 6 months and I'm seriously considering stopping. Side effects are so bad that I'm having a hard time getting through life. Mood swings and bone pain are my 2 main issues. The thing is, I'm cancer free and of course want to stay that way. I think that if my Doctors were more realistic (honest) about the side effects it would be a little easier to deal with them. Reading some of the statements here is helpful actually - I feel a little less alone.",Anonymous
56,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer,7.0,,"June 27, 2014",70,"I am 41. I had been on Effexor for a couple of years, so when I was diagnosed and treated for breast cancer I carried on with the medication.  I started taking Tamoxifen about a month ago.  So far I am very fatigued, have headaches and some physical aches and pains.  I take my Tamoxifen in the morning, with my breakfast, because that seems to calm the nausea that I can get with an empty stomach.  The best thing that I am experiencing now that I am on the Tamoxifen is the ability to cry and work through emotion.  That ability had left me while I was just on the Effexor, I still felt sad, but didn't feel like I could cry.  Well the tears come now, and they feel cleansing and good.  I have much less anxiety about having a cancer re-occurrence.",Lala1234567458
57,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 2, 2014",60,The wisest decision I can share is changing WHEN I take the tamoxifen.  I decided that sleep was imperative in order to deal with the side effects. I take the tamoxifen during the day I live in CA so temp- wise this is a good thing to do. Running hot is an understatement. Skin and hair have taken a hit as the hips have improved.  Suspect no juice to connective tissues is the reason also arthritis has shown up in both knees.  One perk? Evenness of mood after 2 years.  My 10 rating?  No recurrence as of 2.5 years.,HOT HOT HOT

I have had hot flashes, no period (that stopped after my second Chemo in April 2013), sex drive has disappeared (also from Chemo & Tamoxifen combined) and I have had pelvic pain (tend to be more apparent when I lay on my back), joint pain(in my elbow and where legs join pelvic) and lower back pain. I am hoping that some of these side effects will soon subside.  Wow, it is amazing all the different side effects that Tamoxifen causes for people. Reading a lot of these comments has made me now realize that all the pains & aches I have been having, truly are side effects from the Tamoxifen. It's nice to know I'm not alone! ",DOLSSON
61,Tamoxifen,Breast Cancer,10.0,,"July 11, 2013",89,"I was on Tamoxifen for 4 1/2 years after I had my chemo. There were a lot of side effects after stopping estrogen, dry skin, loss of libido, edgy feeling. When I started taking Tamoxifen I felt much better. I didn't feel edgy as the Tamoxifen tricked my body into feeling like it had estrogen. I had hot flashes but did not feel them. My friends would tell me I must have had a hot flash because my face turned red, I highly recommend this medicine. I felt much better on it.",Guardian angel 43
