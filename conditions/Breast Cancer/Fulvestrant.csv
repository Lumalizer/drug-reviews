2,Fulvestrant,Breast Cancer,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 20, 2020",5,Faslodex (fulvestrant):It didn't work for me.  I was on it about 3 months and I was in so much pain that it was hard. The pain was in my joints and bony surfaces.  The doctor did put me on Celebrex and that made the pain go away.  I can't give it a good review because it didn't work for me.,Old Woman
