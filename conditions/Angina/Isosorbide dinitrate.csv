1,Isosorbide dinitrate,Angina,1,,"August 10, 2019",11,"A blood pressure med caused my heart rate to get so low, I ended up in ER and kept over night.  Leaving the hospital, I was given isosorbide 3x a day.  I started having bad angina pain. I never had angina before.  My heart raced 120 to 160 times a minute.  The angina pain caused me to be hospitalized twice. The second time was so bad, I thought I would die. No doctor mentioned it could be from Isosorbide.  I was given nitroglycerin for under the tongue, to stop the pain.  I took nitroglycerin from 2 to 10 times a day for pain.  I started exploring when angina started and tracked it back to when I started taking the Isosorbide.  After slowly taking myself off of it, the pain stopped.  Now I have what feels like nerve damage on left side of my body and down my whole left arm and hand from having this pain for 1 1/2 years I took this med.  I went through a year of horrible test, MRI's, CAT scans, ECHOGRAMS, Heart Cath., ETC.  No answers, I had to figure it out for myself.",Me
2,Isosorbide dinitrate,Angina,4,,"December 19, 2010",19,"I have been using this medicine for a few months now. No matter how much I wanted to feel better by doing so, this medicine never made any difference. I still have angina regardless of taking the tablets regularly 20 mg, twice a day.",Anonymous
3,Isosorbide dinitrate,Angina,9,,"April 30, 2008",33,Made a substantial difference in my quality of life. I get about 10 hours of pain free (angina) time per dose. I take a pill 2x daily and get almost full relief.  Only time I get some little pain now is after a full dinner and some exertion. Before Isosorbide any exertion caused pain.,Anonymous
