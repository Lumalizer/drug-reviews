0,Carvedilol,Angina,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 10, 2017",6,I started on 12 mg a day after MI.  Almost immediate broncospasms requiring medical care. Previously only needed when acid reflux was out of control.  Low blood sugar symptoms were masked until down to critical levels of 35.  I was not warned about this by hospital personnel for type 2 diabetes.  Now only taking 3.25mg a day but still needing inhaler after morning dose...doctor insisting I take this drug....,teenei1949
