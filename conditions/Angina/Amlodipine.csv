2,Amlodipine,Angina,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 22, 2019",20,"After a TIA I found I had high blood pressure 170/110. In the hospital they gave me something that caused HUGE adverse reactions. I was then given a brand name sample by my PCP (expensive) that worked but due to price he switched me to the generic equivalent of 2 meds. We adjusted the dosage of each to find the best for me. Settled on Amlodipine 10mg and Quinapril 40mg. Have been taking these for 5+ years with no side effects that I can say are caused by the drugs. (I experience some of the things reported but know some are caused by other issues I have). Nothing is serious. We twice tried to reduce the Quinapril to 20mg but the systolic slowly went up over 2-3 weeks and when it hit 160 I went back to 40mg. Since I started taking these my BP has been about 134/74 regularly. I am now 68 years old 175-180 pounds, exercise, and watch my diet. Works great for me.",sishilliya
