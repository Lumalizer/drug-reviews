He suffers from headaches, does not eat like he use to and he loved his hot cooked home food so that has gone and will just eat a bowl of cereal for supper we have a sandwich and a piece of cake at lunch time, breakfast and that is all. The other side effects include headache, feeling dizzy, not sleeping any longer than 2 hours each night, also complains of having a hot head but not every day, he just sits and doesn't feel like doing anything and I can understand if he is feeling like this, also his eyes run in the morning but think this is because he does not have enough sleep.I would desperately like him to come off this awful tablets as his tests show that his heart, thank God is alright and his blood pressure now is where it should be.

Then the excruciating headaches began which were relieved by nothing...24 hours a day.  All I could do was stay in bed.  When the pill was in effect for about only 8 hours a day, before the onset of headaches, I felt great, but when it wore off, I couldn't do anything.  Everything caused chest pain.  After the fourth month, the headaches were still excruciating so I stopped taking it.  Have had only one episode of angina since then which seems to be brought on by stress.  I just find I have to be careful not to overdo physically and I do fine.  This med has so many side effects you can't even count them all.  I wondered if it was causing some strange adverse effect in my brain because the headaches didn't start until I had been on it about 3 months.  Asked my cardiologist about this and why the delayed headache.  His answer ""I don't know.""  Big help that was.",Bren
