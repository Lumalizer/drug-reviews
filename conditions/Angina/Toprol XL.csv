0,Toprol XL,Angina,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 4, 2021",1,"Taking it (50 mg once a day, in the morning) for chest troubles, pain, angina, high blood pressure, ..Also taking Adalat Sustained Release Tablets (Nifedipine) 20 mg, each 12 hours.Adalat isn't enough for my pain. Now, I feel OK, acceptable side effects from both of the products. I still don't know whether I should try PREDUCTAL Sustained Release Tablets 35 mg instead of Metoprolol Sustained Release Tablets 50 mg. From what I've heard, both are excellent in treating what I said above.",75~ YO
