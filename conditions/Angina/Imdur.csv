0,Imdur,Angina,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 8, 2021",3,"Went to the ER last Sunday  for chest pain/angina attack, couldn't walk up the stairs without feeling like I was having a heart attack, so new cardiologist put me on Imdur 30mg. The first day I was fine, the second day about 3 to 5 hours after taking it I cane down with an ungodly migraine.  I have been on it now for 6 days, and 5 of them I have had a migraine - not cool.  But I have to admit that I'd rather have the headache because it has been heavenly being able to walk around with zero heart attack like pain",Kelledidit
