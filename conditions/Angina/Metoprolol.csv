2,Metoprolol,Angina,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 4, 2021",1,"Toprol-XL (metoprolol):Taking it (50 mg once a day, in the morning) for chest troubles, pain, angina, high blood pressure, ..Also taking Adalat Sustained Release Tablets (Nifedipine) 20 mg, each 12 hours.Adalat isn't enough for my pain. Now, I feel OK, acceptable side effects from both of the products. I still don't know whether I should try PREDUCTAL Sustained Release Tablets 35 mg instead of Metoprolol Sustained Release Tablets 50 mg. From what I've heard, both are excellent in treating what I said above.",75~ YO

Still getting tests done to see if there is a serious condition. Anyway been dizzy and sick this whole time. Can hardly function, can't stand up for more than half an hour or I get dizzy again.

6,Metoprolol,Angina,9.0,,"March 7, 2017",27,"This drug has literally changed my life in a very short time. I was having horrible chest pains, with a mixture of general anxiety due to work/home stress. Cardiologist found source of my chest pain is a narrowed subclavian artery. The chest pain completely stopped within 24 hours. The only real side effect is difficulty sleeping if instructed to take it at night. I switched to taking it first thing in the morning and I now sleep like a baby. I give it a 9/10 solely for that side effect. I did feel very lethargic when I first took it, but that went away completely after 2 days or so once my body got used to the meds.I feel much more calm than I did before so this medication has really changed the way I feel. improvement is noticeable",McGizzle
7,Metoprolol,Angina,10.0,,"January 25, 2017",20,I had a quadruple bypass and I have been taking metropolol for 9 years now and have just recently had to up my dose to 50 milligrams 3 times a day because I moved to a high altitude location.  This drug has worked for me just fine and I never want to switch.  Hope it helps someone else out there.,midsis

9,Metoprolol,Angina,5.0,,"April 24, 2016",31,"I am 54 and had a stent put in with 95% blockage. I was put on Metoprolol 25mg along with atorvastatin and effient. The first month or so was tough as I had headaches, chest pains shortness of breath, etc. I think a large part of it was anxiety from a life changing surprise condition. No more headaches and anxiety is much, much better. I have a bit of shortness of breath, even when sitting at times, but I have been able to jog at the gym. Just started again this week and went 30 minute today. Overall, not sure if anything is working, but I am trying to just trust my Doctor and listen to my body. Very tough emotionally, but adjusting.",mistermess
10,Metoprolol,Angina,7.0,,"April 2, 2016",11,"I have an ascending aortic aneurysm and was put on metoprolol to help control chest pain and lower my heart rate. I've been on it 1 month and have about half a much pain and my heart rate has dropped from 100's down to 80's. Only side effected noted is mild dizziness every once in a while. I'd like to have no pain, but considering my situation that's not realistic so I'd say I'm happy with the results so far.",Angelina77
11,Metoprolol,Angina,10.0,,"January 31, 2010",25,Lopressor (metoprolol):The best.,sumitahlawat
12,Metoprolol,Angina,10.0,,"September 30, 2009",56,"Lopressor (metoprolol):I have Angina and over the past year began a regime of Bayer (or Bufferin) starting at 500mg every morning. Things got a little worse after six months and I upped my dosage to 1000mg per day. This was all self medication without medical consult (I knew what the problem was). Finally even the 1000mg a day wasn't working and I went to see the doctor. He put me on 50mg of Lopressor per day and things turned around within 2 days. The pain is gone and I can get a whole nights sleep without waking up in the middle of the morning (usually 3-4am, when the incidence of heart attack is the highest statistically) in major pain. So far so good. If you have Angina then DO see a doctor. Get the tests! After all, it's really your life your dealing with.",Anonymous
13,Metoprolol,Angina,10.0,,"June 30, 2009",48,Lopressor (metoprolol):This medication helps more than anything I have tried I have severe angina. I do recommend this as treatment.,bobbysox
14,Metoprolol,Angina,,,"January 12, 2009",38,"I have been using metoprolol for 2 months for high blood pressure and angina. It hasn't done much for my blood pressure (bp) as of this date, but has helped my angina and fast heart rate is under control. Here's hoping soon I'll see a nice reduction in my bp. I feel so much better and will continue to use it.",ms. wes
