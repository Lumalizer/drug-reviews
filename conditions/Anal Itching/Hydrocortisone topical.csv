0,Hydrocortisone topical,Anal Itching,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 16, 2022",0,"I've found Hydrocortisone to be ABSOLUTELY useless for anal itching. Though not perfect, a topical antibiotic and anesthetic (Lidocaine, etc.) was much better.",Anonymous
1,Hydrocortisone topical,Anal Itching,8.0,,"March 6, 2017",4,"I am researching the PRESCRIPTION-strength suppository but I am having no luck on this site. I had the Rx but ran out. By the way, it is much better than the OTC variety. Also, I need it for itching or irritation, post-radiation therapy, not hemorrhoids, but there seems to be no category for that.",Steve1964
