0,Mupirocin topical,Nasal Carriage of Staphylococcus aureus,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 18, 2018",15,"I have had repeated impetigo from a staph colonization in my nose for the last 4+ months. I was told I was prescribed the nasal version as well, but the pharmacist refused to give it to me, telling me to just use the topical ointment intranasally. It burns  my skin, never mind my nose. I don't think I have any cilia left in my nose from the chemical burns.  This is also not recommended on large areas of the body, but my entire body including my scalp, cornea, and kidneys are infected with staph. I have been trapped in my house, not trying to spread the infection, for over 4 months. I REALLY hope I can get appropriate treatment soon.....",Girl in a bubble

3,Mupirocin topical,Nasal Carriage of Staphylococcus aureus,6,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 7, 2014",30,"Bactroban (mupirocin):After several uses of this effective medication I started having a sense of dizziness, shortness of breath and shaking.  Now if I use it just once I have an occurrence of the same symptoms.  I think I have an allergy to Bactroban which gets worse every time I use it.",delray1425
4,Mupirocin topical,Nasal Carriage of Staphylococcus aureus,10,,"January 30, 2011",29,"This ointment is amazing.  Received a prescription as a result of infections from professional nails to see if I was prone to staff infection.  When the physician asked if I had any bump issues, realized this could also cure my painful recurring boil problems.  This medication took care of both. The only problem is that, against physicians recommendation, I began using it daily with the mindset that I never wanted to have another boil.  I think it is causing my hair to fall out.  This is not a permanent medication that should be taken.",Anonymous
5,Mupirocin topical,Nasal Carriage of Staphylococcus aureus,5,,"September 20, 2009",25,"Bactroban (mupirocin):I'm suffering from severe tendonitis/arthralgia or bursitis that is excruciating, to the point of absolute tears, when I awaken. It takes all I have to endure the sharp, searing pains that race through my shoulders, elbows, back (lower and upper and I am still recovering from back surgery/instrumentation), my legs and feet, my hips. I can honestly say I am experiencing pain on level ""12"" on 0-ten scale. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. It takes me a half hour to get out of bed. By about two hours, my pain medicines from my back pain (intractable) take effect and I am able to hobble. Throughout the day, I gain a little more mobility. I watch the symptoms move about my body; not diminishing, only moving. At night, it starts again.",Severe Adverse Reaction
