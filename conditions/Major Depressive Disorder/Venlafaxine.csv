And the BRAIN ZAPS were unbearable; always came out of nowhere and left me feeling dazed and afraid for my sanity. Not worth trying it, IMO. When you try to get off of it, God help you.

I started off on 37.5mg, then up to 75mg 1x daily. I started getting HORRIFIC brain zaps, it felt like I was getting an electric shock straight to the brain every time I blinked or moved. My doctor then tried 2x a day 75mg, and same thing. By the time I was ready for my next dose, I was a mess with brain zaps. So he put me on 3 TIMES A DAY saying it was just me metabolizing them too quickly. They worked for a little, but pretty soon I went right back to experiencing severe depression and anxiety, and this drug definitely didn’t hold up for serious life changes and additional stress. My current psychiatrist is weening me off of it and says she doesn't like this drug, and has the same issue with many of her patients who came to her after starting it. The withdrawal is a NIGHTMARE. Brain zaps, flu like symptoms, tremors, and wild mood swings with hysterics. I will never recommend this drug.",Anonymous

I slowly titrated up to 225mg over the course of several months, and it annihilated most of my severe depression, anxiety, OCD, and inattentive ADHD symptoms. My IQ has gone up significantly (15+ pts) on professional tests and my attention span is amazing now. The best part is that it causes no cravings or addictive behavior like many psychostimulants do. I can finally laugh and smile and find joy in life thanks to this medication and it causes very little emotional blunting... if anything, I feel even more emotionally connected to music and other people since starting it! The only major side effects are increasing sweating and fairly unforgiving dose timing.",Yuki

I had it all in life and one day, I stopped sleeping, eating, smiling, and functioning. I was miserable. I was scared. I was paralyzed by depression and anxiety. Imagine having an 8-hour panic attack but having such deep depression that you couldn’t move off the couch. I literally just sat and watched the sun come up and go down. Day after day, night after night. After a while, I lost the ability to cry. I thought death was the only solution so I thought about it all the time. Luckily, I gave the doctor a try first and after trying two other medications, we finally tried this one and it completely turned it around for me. Game changer. I started sleeping a little bit longer, eating a few more nibbles, cracking a smile here and there. Started to hear music again. Started to feel like life mattered again. Venlafaxine saved my life.

After a while however, it stopped working. I increased my dose but to no avail. After the dose increase, I suffered serotonin syndrome after taking my dose 10 hours earlier than usual, leading to a terrific mental breakdown. I had to then go through cold turkey withdrawals from venlafaxine during the ss, which triggered akathisia which was so unbearable that I had to use benzos and pregabalin to decrease the restlessness that I felt.When I reintroduced venlafaxine into my system and carried on taking it, my mental state got so bad overtime, that I became clinically depressed, suicidal, had intolerable levels of anxiety, and began having heart palpitations.

Things are more manageable. My sleep is better. It’s a journey of course but this is helping. I feel a little more like me and the person I am in my head if that makes sense.

There were side effects however they were minimal. I did notice I tensed up a lot and clench my teeth. Yes, getting off of this stuff sucks to get off of. This is temporary!

If I forgot to take my medicine within a couple hours of my dosage time, I couldn't function with work, chores, etc. Tapering off this drug very slowly was an absolute miserable experience.

Then: always dizzy, more depressed, feeling physically paralyzed. It got worse at 37.5mg, brain zaps causing such bad vertigo that I avoided leaving my appartment. Stopping it entirely, depression was worse than it had been in months, felt too sick to eat, moving my head slightly was enough to cause a migraine. I had so little energy that I - no joke - called my pharmacy to tell them the Adderall they gave me was defective.I was cocky, because I never get any bad side effects from meds. Stopping this med is dangerous: I almost went to the ER 2x, once because I was worried I couldn't to keep myself safe, then because the brain zaps and vertigo were so bad I thought I was going to collapse.

Go down in dose for two weeks. Half the dose again for two weeks. Repeat until you're down to the lowest dose, (37.5 I believe). Get some empty capsules (or empty out the capsules from a OTC supplement) and put half of each of the effexors into those capsules. That's the lowest dose you'll get.

I have a huge one down my arm from another suicide attempt (which did get stitches) I also have anxiety and disassociation disorder, etc. I am overall a very insecure jealous person as well.

This dose combined with CBT (therapy) has greatly increased the quality of my life. But NEVER FORGET A PILL! Withdrawal is awful! Sobbing, ""shocks"", lethargy.",Unbroken0007

It was such a God send. Then with doctors advice after approx 12 mths I went off it.  I went on it two more times,  but my dose was higher and higher- no real help to me. Then a third time, I went off my head on it. The anxiety was woeful, so severe. I phoned up the help line for mental health and got the usual spiel- give it time, yes, it can cause that, speak with you doctor and so on. I read how this can happens then wamo it works. But I had already been on it before and never had such side effects.  It was horrible, and scary.  My personal experience is two opposites. Good and horrible.",Eliza_nsw

My mind was clear, my thoughts and emotions was where they need to be. I felt focused and alert. The only problem was I suffer from high blood pressure, which became out of control.Effexor even help with my night sweats. I have been depressed for over two years so I really struggled to keep things in order. If I could have continued with the medication I would have stayed on it. It worked for me in a lot of different ways. ",Hollywood chica

There were also several other problems that effexor XR seemed to control or help control.  Depression is painful emotionally, mentally and physically, without the some kind of relief I would have been institutionalized.  For maximum effectiveness, counseling by a person trained in all aspects of the disorder is the only one I found to help bring me back to a realistic understanding of how to heal.  Interestingly, I found several psychiatrists that attempted counseling and were totally inept in their efforts.",triiv

The reason for the switch was that I developed anxiety problems at that age in addition to depression, and the Prozac was not treating the anxiety. Effexor works very well to treat both anxiety and depression but if I stop taking it for even 1-2 days (which is often because I am very forgetful) I become extremely depressed for the next 1-2 days. Right now I am in one such down swing after taking my Effexor for the first time in about 5 days. If you avoid doing that though you should be fine, the medication does help a lot.",Cherno

Nothing else has worked. I was on Wellbutrin for 2 years but it quit doing anything and after 4 medicine changes my doctor put me on this. Within a week I was not sulking around, I had energy to get off the couch and shower, and actually found I could laugh again! My husband has noticed the difference in my mood as well. I am having horrible sweats at night, and a little blurry vision along with nightmares/weird dreams. But I'm hoping that might fade some as I take it longer.

219,Venlafaxine,Major Depressive Disorder,7.0,,"May 13, 2014",70,"Effexor (venlafaxine):I give this a 7 because it does work. BUT be very cautious of the side effects. I was on it for 2 years, first started on the regular dose, then switched to extended release as the medicine would ""wear off"" throughout the day. While it helped tremendously with my depression and anxiety (it was almost non-existent) the side effects alone were debilitating. I gained 20 pounds, would fall asleep midday (we're talking I had to pry my eyes open to keep from passing out in the middle of a conversation), I was tired ALL DAY. I sweat PROFUSELY and the dizziness I experienced from missing a dose by only a few minutes, plus the heart palpitations were enough for me to stop. ",Aymie520
