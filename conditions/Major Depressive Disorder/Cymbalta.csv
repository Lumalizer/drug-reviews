0,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 27, 2022",0,"I was on cymbalta for over a year. When I started, I had significant fatigue which I countered with Adderall. What I wasn't aware of at that time was the intense brain fog and impact on my cognitive abilities. It's difficult to be aware of changes like this as they are happening. I noticed memory problems such as not recalling conversations with my partner, and forgetting tasks at work. I  realized the extent of the impact only once I decided to stop taking Cymbalta. I tapered off very slowly as I had read the horror series of others quitting too abruptly. Even slowly, the cessation was difficult. Its now been over 6 months since I quit and I am still dealing with insomnia which I believe is an after effect caused by Cymbalta. I would warn people against taking this medicine as the memory problems alone are not worth it, especially with so many other medicines on the market. Take only as a last resort for significant depression. The trade-offs aren't worth it for mild cases.",DiscountPuppies

3,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 13, 2022",1,"I’ve been on cymbalta for a little over 2 months now and I feel it works well for me, I take it alongside buspirone. I take 60mg at night. Does a good job at keeping my depression at bay, if I do feel sadness, it’s very minor compared to how it used to be. Also does well at controlling my anxiety, which is a nice bonus! You see people giving this drug a bad review but don’t let them scare you away, the truth of the matter is, everyone reacts to medication differently, works well for some and terrible for others, the only way you will know that is if you try it for yourself.",Knight987

5,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 23, 2021",16,"I don't even know how to start.. In basic terms, Cymbalta is something I never could have imagined possible.I was also extremely suicidal, self loathing, always denied anything happy or would get pissed off at just the idea of it, anxiety through the roof constantly and stressed out and over thinking about every little thing, super isolative to the point where I can quite literally stay in my room for weeks and weeks as well as skip personal hygiene for similar durations. I actually got my first job while I started Cymbalta, which says a lot coming from me and where I've been in life. This medicine is truly a divine experience for me. To go from the depths of the void into everything I seemingly had no awareness of or could see before taking it... It's mind boggling to me even still",Orphanatom
6,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 7, 2021",3,"I had tried prozac, zoloft, and before cymbalta, lexapro. None had worked so my doctor prescribed me cymbalta to see if I just needed to be on another type of antidepressant. Cymbalta sent me into the worst suicidal episode I ever had in my life and It became so bad that I was sent to the psych hospital. I got prescribed anxiety meds and wellbutrin, but even after a few weeks of that, I was still stuck in the episode that cymbalta triggered. I've had my wellbutrin dose increased to 300mg and am taking buspar and I finally feel normal. If you are like me and have multiple serious mental disorders, please be cautious with this medication :(",Mandy
7,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,5.0,,"August 28, 2021",4,"On cymbalta 60 mg  for 5 years. At 11 months I was hospitalized  with myocarditis. I continued taking it as doctors said that there was no connection. Although I had my doubts . Still have. It made me into another man, I was fearless, full of energy, it cured my depression and  GAD - it is a real motivation drug. But not forever. Liver enzymes and cholesterol high. I decided to stop taking it cause I got scared of these side effects . My doctor helped me. I had the worst time of my life for about 2 1/2 months. The withdrawals are unbearable. Brain zaps, vomiting, headaches, insomnia, fatigue and tinnitus. I was prescribed clonazepam to control side effects. I'm off for about 7 months and I feel like I was living in a dream for 5 years on this drug. I don't know if it's good or bad. Was this the real me, or just the drug changed my brain function? For sure it helped me but not without price. I am frustrated. Either you are mental healthy or physical? Be careful if you are on Cymbalta and drinking alcohol. It makes you more resistant",TonyTonic

I became super super depressed. Doc switched me to Cymbalta 60mg per day. It worked and felt so much better. However these last 3 mo or so I've noticed my happiness has definitely gone down hill. And I've noticed I've become very short tempered, agitated, and angry. I'm contacting my Doc today about switching me back to Lexapro....",Skippy

10,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 26, 2021",1,"Got prescribed Cymbalta for depression, anxiety and panic attacks. It quickly started working to alleviate all of them and I have not experienced a panic attack since. After being on the med for 3+ years, its effects on depression weren't adequate anymore. I begged my psychiatrist to increase the dose, and by the time they did, it was a bit late and I had an increase in suicidal thoughts & behaviour. Finally after 4 years I was weaned off to try something else. I was having a reaction to another medication so I'm not sure how much of the discomfort was the reaction or if it was the withdrawal. Overall a great med to try if you're anxious *and* depressed, especially since they tend to fuel each other.",tyhmyydenylistys

This stuff really peps up your mood and works quickly and will make you feel happy and energetic. However I forgot my meds when I flew from CO to TX for my sister's wedding and went into a horrible withdrawal I could not think straight and had unnerving thoughts and felt the lowest I've ever felt in my life, nasty experience. It worked well but the withdrawal I had from forgetting my meds scared me from taking it again. However it will help with depression, but has a few bad side effects.",Crod8309

My Dr. has now diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), my depression has become debilitating. No energy, no drive, no strength to leave my bedroom. I was on Vyvanse for almost 2 years.  I really needed a stimulants to animate me, I had energy and had function. I changed doctors and she took me off of it and I've been like this ever since.   She put me on 30 more mg.

I asked my doctor to adjust my dosage due to depression getting worse, I had a reaction to it. Then the doctor wanted me to tamper off of it in a 4 day period. The dosage caused another reaction. I am now on day 4 of withdraw. I am have to be on a medication to help me withdraw. As well as the new anti depressant doctor put me on. I feel so very very awful.

14,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,,"April 3, 2021",10,"Cymbalta is the WORST medication I've ever taken. I've never experienced a worse withdrawal. I started Cymbalta after Lexapro stopped working for me. After starting Cymbalta, things got worse. The little bit of work that Lexapro was doing was more effective than Cymbalta. I went from being barely functional to being in a catatonic state. I was on it for 5 weeks before my psych. took me off of it. Big mistake. Despite tapering the medication & starting Prozac, I was met with nausea, vertigo, lightheadedness, brain zaps, hot flashes, & fatigue. They tapered me off more slowly. Still didn't work. Yesterday was my first day back off of Cymbalta and I ended up vomiting, on top of the other symptoms I mentioned. And you know what happened when I took it again last night? All those symptoms went away. The physical dependency that this med. creates due to its short half-life is insane. Not recommended. Cymbalta is an ineffective drug with a severe withdrawal.",Ponyo

I also was diagnosed Bi Polar but another Dr didn't think so...anytime I felt like it should be better they would tell me I wouldn't ever be 100%, it was just supposed to help. I was ready to give up and went to a new place and they prescribed me Cymbalta. I am on buspar and iron. But I think the Cymbalta is the best thing I have ever tried. I felt a little difference after  1 dose of 30mg. I'm an now a month in and I feel the best I ever have and I literally was ready to give up. I was so miserable feeling that way. So after 10 years of struggling. I'm so happy. I feel like a different person. All my drs tried me on SSRIs and never a SSNRIs...I have faith in meds now.",DD
16,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,,"January 18, 2021",8,"Cymbalta is the best anti-depressant I have been prescribed since my diagnosis of MDD in 2016. I have been taking 90mg nightly shortly before I go to sleep. With my depression, anxiety creeps up on me at night, causing severe insomnia. In combination with Trazodone, my body actually gets a full 8 hours of sleep. Though there are downsides, around 12-16 hours after my dosage, I do feel the same unpleasant thoughts creeping up on me, yet very much have improved. With Cymbalta, missed dosages WILL NOT go unnoticed. Physically, my body rejects sleep, loss of appetite and tremors come back after 24 hours without a dose. Brain zaps and skin tingling are unpleasant, and taking this medication every day is vital to preventing a relapse. To me, the pros outweigh the cons. I am alive! At one time, as I was newly prescribed Cymbalta 14 months ago, I didn’t see that as attainable. Nighttime is helpful for me, and time of day to take this drug is an important inquiry for your psychiatrist.",Livvy
17,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 15, 2021",4,"I take Cymbalta for my depression, anxiety and fibromyalgia. I was diagnosed MD in 1999 and over the years I have tried several medications. Lexapro was working great and I was on that for a few years until I found out I had fibro and the specialist recommended a change from Lexapro to Cymbalta. I was hesitant because the Lexapro worked GREAT! I was well balanced and able to self-regulate my emotions, but I was also taking Lyrica for the pain and I liked the idea of the Cymbalta helping with nerve pain. I was hopeful that I could stop the Lyrica. My PCP started me at 30mg a day. I knew it took 4-6 weeks to kick in and I was a wreck. At the 2 month mark I called my PCP in a mad panic asking him to bump it up because I was ready to let my inner screams out. He told me to start taking 60mg. I've been on that dosage for 9 months and I have cut my Lyrica down to just one in the morning from 3 times a day. It isn't as good as the Lexapro for me, but it helps with my nerve pain.",Bengal76

When I turned 18, I was recommended Cymbalta by my PCP. I started at 20 mg daily for 1 month and was bumped up to 40 mg after. Though I don't necessarily regret taking this medication, it was most definitely NOT for me. My depression worsened and I experienced intense emotional blunting/dissociation. For a good 2 weeks, I did not get out of bed except to use the bathroom. No showers, no brushing teeth, not much eating. My anxiety shot through the roof. A 20 minute trip to Costco left me in the fetal position on the bathroom floor for 2 hours, sobbing. Suicidal ideation increased, I got closer to a suicide attempt than I ever had before. I started abusing Adderall again. Libido was ok, definitely lowered a bit though. I quit the medication cold turkey, the withdrawal symptoms weren't too terrible - likely because my dosage was relatively low. Keep fighting the good fight, everyone.",Anonymous

For the first time in my life (50s), both my anxiety AND major depression are under control.  The first few months, this drug knocked me out cold, best taken at night.   After being on it for three years, the only side effect I have is major lag in orgasm (I'm a woman)--I'm looking at reducing my dosage if possible to see if that changes things, as enjoying sex is important to me.

Only 2 major side effects: trouble initiating sleep (but once I do get to sleep I do so with less frequent interruptions than before, and its easier to fall back asleep after a bathroom trip) and increased sweating (but I actually like leaving puddles at the gym so this is a bonus for me). 8/10.

Cymbalta 60mg along with critically depleted in MDD patients Methylfolate 15mg, and Ace-L-Carnitine have given me my life back. Although I think it’s causing night sweats, it has taken the edge off of the stress from chronic pain, as well as, PTSD, and I’m more calm and at peace.

It took a long time to kick in. 12 weeks but when it finally did it killed the anxiety . It came with crippling fatigue though for the first few weeks but it was amazing to sleep without panic attacks for the first time in years. I just countered it with a ton of coffee. I have been taking it for 9 years now and it is really messing with my stomach and intestines. It didn't for the first 5-6 years but now it's bad so time to get off it.

Overall, I’d say my experience with Cymbalta has been a positive one. I don’t particularly suffer from any of the listed side effects. Compared to other anti depressant-type medications, in my opinion, I would say Cymbalta in particular kicked in, the fastest, to where I started feeling better than the previous anti depressants I’ve been prescribed in the past. Cymbalta isn’t the common SSRI we’re all familiar with, this medication is an SNRI, which means it not only works to boost your Serotonin, but also Norepinephrine (also known as Noradrenalin and/or Noradrenaline).

89,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,6.0,,"May 26, 2015",14,"Been on Cymbalta now for approximately 1 year. My moods are stable, less pain, generally feel better. However, one side effect is unacceptable. On this medication, I feel like I am no longer male. Less desire, followed by greatly reduced sensitivity, as well as inability to maintain an erection longer than a minute make married life most difficult. I tried to come off the drug. It is extremely difficult. Dizziness, light sensitivity, horrible headaches, and extreme irritability.",M76
90,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,,"May 22, 2015",16,"Don't take this drug. Just don't. My Dr told me nothing about the side effects or how potent it really is. I took it for a week and I felt like I was cracked out the whole time. Total depersonalization suicidal thoughts weird head pains, chest pains, vomiting and completely drained of energy. After only taking this for a week the withdrawals were horrendous and I was only on 30mg. Brain zaps, palpitations, chills, insomnia, sweating, diarrhea and the list goes on. Worst two weeks of my life. I can't imagine what coming off this drug feels like when you have taken it long term. Do not take this drug ",Madibbbbb bb

Had a moderate adjustment with ups and downs. It was not as effacacious so titrated down viibryd and up on cymbalta. Got deeply depressed in between and on one moderate day; tried wellbutrin. I  titrated slowly up and this was death warmed over! Titrated back from hell to 60 cymbalta. I am just back to normal. Long story short: if it's not broken don't fix it. Cymbalta still is the best. Some weight gain but some exercise can help it a bit..",Howmil
92,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,6.0,,"April 20, 2015",18,"Helps with depression but my doc has had to increase my dose to keep up with my depression.  I guess I get used to the drug & need more.  Huge weight gain -- 18 pounds over 2 months after the last increase to 120 mg.  but I guess I'd rather be plump than crying depressed forever.  Zero libido but that might be my age (65).   I hope I can decrease the dosage as I learn to cope with specific life events largely related to my Dad's death and my mother in a nursing home (nightmare).   No help with anxiety & doc prescribed Xanax for that.  No difference in back pain.  In summary: helps depression, but I gained weight & lost interest in sex & other things.  Does not help pain and does nothing for my anxiety.",Dscot

94,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 12, 2015",21,My celexa stopped working around Thanksgiving. I have been slowly going into a tail spin since. My Dr changed me to Zoloft which I took for 5 weeks and only got worse. I took my first cymbalta yesterday and woke up this morning with so much less pain and could actually walk without my joints hurting. Not to mention that My mind seems to be coming around too. I cannot believe how fast this medicine has begun working for me. Between the severe depression and back pain I had been having thoughts of suicide for over 2 weeks now. I actually slept good last night and feel so much better already today!,Anonymous
95,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,,"January 8, 2015",46,"I have been taking 120mg of Cymbalta, daily, since it was first introduced & I couldn't be more satisfied with its results. I was diagnosed with severe, clinical, depression, approximately 15 years ago & all antidepressants prescribed to me, prior to Cymbalta, worked for a year, before they completely stopped working for me. I've tried every SSRI available & the same thing would happen, every time, UNTIL Cymbalta became available. I have no negative side effects, never have, & Im so very grateful for them.",Happy camper
96,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 23, 2014",64,After I started taking this I was glued to this web site reading everybody's positive feedback to give me hope. I had been on it a couple years ago and it worked very well but stopped as life improved with little side effects. A couple years went by and life took a turn for the worse. Going from being very comfortable financially to almost homeless and loosing everything I had including my wife I went to get help. I can not explain in words how horrible I felt. I was in such a dark place this time I had my doubts it would work but it has. I am starting to feel better after a week and a half and hope it continues. I have tried many different anti-depressants mentioned here and none of them worked. Cymbalta saved my life!,steven0610123

100,Cymbalta,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,,"June 6, 2014",62,"I was on 100mg of Pristiq which really wasn't working for me. I stopped taking medication and started having suicidal thoughts.A friend recommended Cymbalta so I saw a Dr and started on 30mg. Within a month my depression was nearly non-existent. I had off days but overall it was amazing. After the month though, I noticed I was starting to feel down and irritable towards the end of the day (I take mine at night before sleep)I've been increased to 60 mg and I can't be happier. I have not felt this calm and happy with life in close on 7 yearsThere are noticeable side effects for me. I have extremely vivid dreams most nights and I can recall most of them upon waking. Also loss of appetite is a big one.",Fitzy2211

I was prescribed it for Major Depressive Disorder along with BPD and anxiety. It seemed to make me a bit null at first then it helped me think more clearly, less invaded by suicidal thoughts, etc. I do take it along with quetiapine (an antipsyscotic) and it seems to meld well with it .",drew 742
