Psych told me to stop after 9 months.Not taper off just stop!! My goodness not a good idea...moody, awake all night, asleep all day, felt sick, was manic as for 8 hrs straight. Never again. I don't understand why  I was not tapered off. Not happy with psych at all.",Bridge

3,Doxepin,Major Depressive Disorder,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 24, 2016",46,"I've taken almost every SSRI and even a few MAOI's. I started taking Doxepin, and Wow! I was finally sleeping the whole night through! Since I've been sleeping better, I am up at a normal hour. I am able to do the things that I used to do. I without a doubt, find Doxepin to be far superior to any of the antidepressants that I've ever been on. Plus, the anxiety I used to get at bedtime, always worrying if I am going to be able to sleep, is gone now. I hope that others have the positive effects that I now have.",Miss Trish
