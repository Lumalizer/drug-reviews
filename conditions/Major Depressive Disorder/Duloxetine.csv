0,Duloxetine,Major Depressive Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 27, 2022",0,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):I was on cymbalta for over a year. When I started, I had significant fatigue which I countered with Adderall. What I wasn't aware of at that time was the intense brain fog and impact on my cognitive abilities. It's difficult to be aware of changes like this as they are happening. I noticed memory problems such as not recalling conversations with my partner, and forgetting tasks at work. I  realized the extent of the impact only once I decided to stop taking Cymbalta. I tapered off very slowly as I had read the horror series of others quitting too abruptly. Even slowly, the cessation was difficult. Its now been over 6 months since I quit and I am still dealing with insomnia which I believe is an after effect caused by Cymbalta. I would warn people against taking this medicine as the memory problems alone are not worth it, especially with so many other medicines on the market. Take only as a last resort for significant depression. The trade-offs aren't worth it for mild cases.",DiscountPuppies
1,Duloxetine,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 18, 2022",0,"I am on generic duloxetine but it's the same thing. I am also on this to manage anxiety on top of depression. My dose is 60mg once a day (I take mine at night).I have to admit that starting the medication was a bit of a rough ride. The ""worse before it gets better"" phenomenon was kind of nasty and I did get suicidal thoughts but I didn't have the urge to do it, so I stood with it and I'm really, really glad I did. It was because of this drug that I was able to stop being agoraphobic and finally leave my home after months. I have also regained my confidence to talk to people again, especially over the phone, and I genuinely feel like I got my life back because of Cymbalta. All the staying-at-home quarantines really got to me especially since I was already suffering from mental illnesses and it made me retract and become someone else I didn't recognize. Cymbalta got me to a place mentally where I could feel normal again and I'm grateful for it.",Mau

I take 60mg at night. Does a good job at keeping my depression at bay, if I do feel sadness, it’s very minor compared to how it used to be. Also does well at controlling my anxiety, which is a nice bonus!

The first 2 years everything was good until it wasn't. The side effects rolled in totalling 25 by year 6. Four months after my final dose and bedridden with Post-Acute-Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS). I found CHW (cymbalta hurts worse) fb group. So everyone on here thinking everything is good. Well it might be for now. It won't later. I'm now feeling so awful and nothing can help.

In basic terms, Cymbalta is something I never could have imagined possible.I was also extremely suicidal, self loathing, always denied anything happy or would get pissed off at just the idea of it, anxiety through the roof constantly and stressed out and over thinking about every little thing, super isolative to the point where I can quite literally stay in my room for weeks and weeks as well as skip personal hygiene for similar durations. I actually got my first job while I started Cymbalta, which says a lot coming from me and where I've been in life. This medicine is truly a divine experience for me. To go from the depths of the void into everything I seemingly had no awareness of or could see before taking it... It's mind boggling to me even still",Orphanatom

None had worked so my doctor prescribed me cymbalta to see if I just needed to be on another type of antidepressant. Cymbalta sent me into the worst suicidal episode I ever had in my life and It became so bad that I was sent to the psych hospital. I got prescribed anxiety meds and wellbutrin, but even after a few weeks of that, I was still stuck in the episode that cymbalta triggered. I've had my wellbutrin dose increased to 300mg and am taking buspar and I finally feel normal.

Very sick with side effects for 2 weeks and lost 13 lbs. raised dosage to 90mg and more but less severe side effects. I feel great now. Happy, less anxious, more patient, getting along better with others.  After losing weight my blood sugars came down. Terrible muscle pain (in legs) and brain fog resolved. A surprise was my appetite returned to normal, cravings disappeared and sense of taste returned. Have lost 35 lbs.I agree that stopping cymbalta last time was awful. Always titrate down slowly.

I continued taking it as doctors said that there was no connection. Although I had my doubts . Still have. It made me into another man, I was fearless, full of energy, it cured my depression and  GAD - it is a real motivation drug. But not forever. Liver enzymes and cholesterol high. I decided to stop taking it cause I got scared of these side effects . My doctor helped me. I had the worst time of my life for about 2 1/2 months. The withdrawals are unbearable. Brain zaps, vomiting, headaches, insomnia, fatigue and tinnitus. I was prescribed clonazepam to control side effects. I'm off for about 7 months and I feel like I was living in a dream for 5 years on this drug. I don't know if it's good or bad. Was this the real me, or just the drug changed my brain function?

It quickly started working to alleviate all of them and I have not experienced a panic attack since. After being on the med for 3+ years, its effects on depression weren't adequate anymore. I begged my psychiatrist to increase the dose, and by the time they did, it was a bit late and I had an increase in suicidal thoughts & behaviour. Finally after 4 years I was weaned off to try something else. I was having a reaction to another medication so I'm not sure how much of the discomfort was the reaction or if it was the withdrawal. Overall a great med to try if you're anxious *and* depressed, especially since they tend to fuel each other.",tyhmyydenylistys

My doc told me to try 60mg for a month and if it doesn’t work we need to up to 90mg and 120mg. I’m an anxious person, stressed, depressed, fibromyalgia and ADHD. SO It takes time to find a good medication!!! Be patient and don’t panic. I’m on 90mg Cymbalta and so far I still feel the same. The only side effect I got is losing my appetite. Maybe it’s the first months of depression taking it. When I got my first depression, I took citalopram for 4 years and I loved it!! Then I was diagnosed with fibro and my pharmacist told me we could change it for Cymbalta and I don’t regret it. My mood swings, my memory are better and I have less pain than before.

I started Cymbalta after Lexapro stopped working for me. After starting Cymbalta, things got worse. The little bit of work that Lexapro was doing was more effective than Cymbalta. I went from being barely functional to being in a catatonic state. I was on it for 5 weeks before my psych. took me off of it. Big mistake. Despite tapering the medication & starting Prozac, I was met with nausea, vertigo, lightheadedness, brain zaps, hot flashes, & fatigue. They tapered me off more slowly. Still didn't work. Yesterday was my first day back off of Cymbalta and I ended up vomiting, on top of the other symptoms I mentioned. And you know what happened when I took it again last night? All those symptoms went away. The physical dependency that this med. creates due to its short half-life is insane. Not recommended. Cymbalta is an ineffective drug with a severe withdrawal.",Ponyo

26,Duloxetine,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,,"January 18, 2021",8,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):Cymbalta is the best anti-depressant I have been prescribed since my diagnosis of MDD in 2016. I have been taking 90mg nightly shortly before I go to sleep. With my depression, anxiety creeps up on me at night, causing severe insomnia. In combination with Trazodone, my body actually gets a full 8 hours of sleep. Though there are downsides, around 12-16 hours after my dosage, I do feel the same unpleasant thoughts creeping up on me, yet very much have improved. With Cymbalta, missed dosages WILL NOT go unnoticed. Physically, my body rejects sleep, loss of appetite and tremors come back after 24 hours without a dose. Brain zaps and skin tingling are unpleasant, and taking this medication every day is vital to preventing a relapse. To me, the pros outweigh the cons. I am alive! At one time, as I was newly prescribed Cymbalta 14 months ago, I didn’t see that as attainable.

I was hesitant because the Lexapro worked GREAT! I was well balanced and able to self-regulate my emotions, but I was also taking Lyrica for the pain and I liked the idea of the Cymbalta helping with nerve pain. I was hopeful that I could stop the Lyrica. My PCP started me at 30mg a day. I knew it took 4-6 weeks to kick in and I was a wreck. At the 2 month mark I called my PCP in a mad panic asking him to bump it up because I was ready to let my inner screams out. He told me to start taking 60mg.
