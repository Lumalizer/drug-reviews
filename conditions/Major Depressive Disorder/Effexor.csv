Then I took the Covid vaccine (Moderna) and the med just quit. So my PCP gave me Effexor, first 75mg, then 150 mg and it was great.  Lasted until I started on Humira for rheumatoid arthritis and now I am getting little help from the Effexor. I am going to quit the Humira and see if Effexor returns. Hoping and praying.",PhxBarb

I had insanely painful diarrhea, that looked like someone had set up a broken coffee machine over the toilet, day in and day out.

4,Effexor,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 26, 2021",6,"I was prescribed Effexor after taking prozac for anxiety and depression. Prozac made me more suicidal and depressed hence why I switched. Effexor 30 mg is by far the worst medicine I have ever taken. I had terrible night terrors, I sweated a lot for no reason, I slept walked a lot, I was angry all the time for no reason, no sex drive, and when I did have sex I could never enjoy it to completion. This medicine made me feel crazy. I'd give it a negative 10 if I could. I ended up back in the mental hospital and the doctor suggested I take more!! I completely stopped taking it one day cold turkey and I am finally back to feeling myself. Avoid at all cost!!",Joy
5,Effexor,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,,"April 1, 2021",10,"PLEASE research this drug extensively before beginning!! 26 year old female and have been suffering with severe depression since childhood. Have tried various types of medications for my depression over the years, and can honestly say, Effexor was by FAR and large the WORST antidepressant I've ever taken. The side-effects were horrible: severe headaches, nausea, dizziness, nightmares, waking up in pools of sweats, hit my lowest of lows, and had frequent suicidal thoughts. If I forgot to take my medicine within a couple hours of my dosage time, I couldn't function with work, chores, etc. Tapering off this drug very slowly was an absolute miserable experience. I'm someone that tries to find some good in even bad experiences, however, I have not a single positive thing to say about this drug. I wouldn't even want my worst enemy to feel a minute of the side-effects I did on this drug. If I could give a ""0"" rating for this drug, I would.  Will never touch this medication another day of my life!",Starry94
6,Effexor,Major Depressive Disorder,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 2, 2021",8,"I took Effexor for a number of years some time back. I recently started up again. I can say, it balanced me out. Right now, I'm dealing with, ""COVID Fatigue"". I work from home but I'm exhausted by the end of the day and I shouldn't be.Here's a tip for getting off it. Go down in dose for two weeks. Half the dose again for two weeks. Repeat until you're down to the lowest dose, (37.5 I believe). Get some empty capsules (or empty out the capsules from a OTC supplement) and put half of each of the effexors into those capsules. That's the lowest dose you'll get. I was able to wean myself off Cymbalta that way and I was up to 60 or 90mg/day. It took some time but I had virtually no withdrawal.",B-in-AZ
7,Effexor,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 22, 2020",27,"After 10 years of Major depression and extreme anxiety- trying several different medication combos I was offered ECT, but I was hesitant. As a last resort we tried Effexor 150mg, Wellbutrin 150mg and Abilify 5mg. Within 3 months the anxiety and depression started to lift. 3 years later I have no anxiety or depression. I am stable and feel at peace. For past 6 months my dosage has been Venlor 37,5mg, Wellbutrin 150mg and Abilify 2.5mg. Over the next 6 months I will try and reduce further- but weaning off Effexor literally means reducing one little bead in the capsule per day otherwise withdrawal can be unpleasant. My only negative had been weight gain of 10kgs in 3 years, despite watching my diet and daily exercise. I am 58 years old and have always been slim, now I’m plump.

When my mother died I was under so much stress, not thinking straight- I decided to go off Effexor and straight onto Zoloft (as I thought it had stopped working) and in turn I ended up with my first panic attack, mania, and later a psychotic break (The whole time I did not understand what was happening to me).  It was the scariest experience of my life.  It landed me in a psych ward for days where I was almost attacked by another patient twice (you never want to go)..It's dangerous and I was given strange drugs/injections which made my reaction more horrifying.  I couldn't communicate that I stopped Effexor because I couldn't remember. I was treated horribly.  Once out I was put back on an snri & then my brain started to work again.  If I had known this reaction was possible I wouldn't have started it.  I nearly died and need therapy due to the trauma.",Mrs

Tried every class of psych med (30 total), SSRIs all made me sleepy, numb, apathetic. I take Lamictal (150mg), Effexor (75mg) and Ritalin (30mg) which is the best medicine combo for my depression.Pros: Effexor demolishes anxiety and severe episodes  (crying spells, suicidal thoughts). Less sedating (compared to SSRIs). I feel calm, no insomnia.Cons: Excessive sweating (at higher doses), some lethargy, and dry eye. ****Do not go cold turkey,  ask for the ""Prozac Taper""  to avoid the shock of withdrawals***No drug is a cure-all.

I am now 45years old and have had no further periods of depression since and have continued taking it. That is despite being almost permanently depressed before taking it. Yes I have low moods now occasionally but they are due to situational stress and a normal reaction to rubbish things happening. And I have not had suffered any major side effects, certainly nothing that would stop me taking it. Night sweats are probably the worst. And I do suffer from withdrawals if I forget to take the medication for 24hrs. Overall a very positive and life changing drug. BTW.

Anxiety and depression no more.   I do have some side affects.  I do get heated quite easily, I have had vomiting on occasion,  nausea.

Couldn't get out of bed due to pain, desperately wanted to sleep to get away from it. Tapered down and by 75mg had no muscle ache whatsoever but suffered horrible nausea, brain zaps and shakiness from withdrawal that I am still feeling very strongly after being completely off the drug for 1 and a half weeks.

I got so drowsy that I fell asleep through a 12 hour work shift as a caregiver, client had a fall and I did not wake up. I could not open my eyes no matter how badly I tried. Detoxing was worse. Unbearable body aches that made me more depressed than I’d ever been because nothing relieved it. The brain zaps made me breakdown into a full panic attack crying every time because they were so painful and agitating. I’m 3 weeks off of it and having bizarre behaviors that I NEVER had before, even in my worst depression.

Now as long as I take it before 1 pm, I sleep fine.  I've been taking it since January of 2014 and have noticed me being much calmer, still anxious at times, but much better before prescribed to me!  It DOES cause, weight loss, drowsiness and fatigue if I take it while lying down.",Costillo
42,Effexor,Major Depressive Disorder,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 25, 2015",18,"Don't take it. Your emotions become dull and feel fake. Even your laughter feels fake. Your sleep becomes horrible. You overeat because you don't care anymore. The first week you feel like you're on meth. It feels great. Then it wears away and you become a dull and empty mess with memory problems and no motivation to do anything including getting off of the medicine. It's easier just to take it. I'm in my second week of withdrawal. I would just take 8-10 beads when I would get dizzy and it would go away. ez-pz. My depression did come back even worse. Maybe it's my minds way of telling me I'm not doing anything to make my life better. Maybe I should change my life instead of taking a pill, especially this pill.",AnotherDanApparently
43,Effexor,Major Depressive Disorder,5.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 22, 2015",25,"I took Effexor for many years. I believe I was becoming resistant to it because it wasn't addressing my depression anymore. I tapered off as slowly as possible and I can safely say it is the worst withdrawal I have ever had in my life. Nausea, dizziness, sickly feeling, huge brain zaps, lethargy, headaches. It was horrible. I am so glad to be off of it. My new medication, wellbutrin and lexapro are much better in controlling my chronic major depression. I will never be off drugs, but I would never take this drug again.",Tinteardrop
44,Effexor,Major Depressive Disorder,,,"September 19, 2015",36,"17 years ago I had a breakdown with anxiety and depression - tried aropax and it was hell on earth. Changed to efexor, it started working after 3 weeks. I've been on it for 17 years or so on various doses between 150 and 375 and it's been amazing. I worry about health side effects but it's been a life saver, no longer a wreck but can cope.",Meeee12345
45,Effexor,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,,"August 19, 2015",23,"Increase dose more slowly than the doctor says. I was convinced I was actually in hell for a week after increasing my dose for one single day. It helps my situation, but it ruins my memory, kills motivation, kills desire or will to do anything. A cool and crisp morning loses that good feeling and your sleep sucks causing you to be tired all day. I would recommend to take a dose only on days you feel awful. Maybe 15mg. I regret taking this every day. The withdrawal is worse than alcohol, tobacco and other SSRIs combined.",DanMedicineReview

47,Effexor,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 18, 2015",29,"I have been through the gamut of antidepressant meds. Celexa,  Lexapro, cymbalta, Zoloft, fetzima and several others over the last 13 years.  My doctor kept leading me away from Effexor because of the bad withdrawals it has. This drug is working pretty well so far. My insurance lapsed tho once. I went without meds for 4 days and I was on a high dose. She was right about those withdrawals.  The worst I've ever had. Severe nightmares, sweats, extremely low energy, brain zaps, every noise would set my head in a tailspin.  I've had pain med withdrawal and benzo withdrawal and nothing compares to coming of this med. Thankfully my insurance kicked back in and after a day and half I was starting to feel better again. It works. But not w/o risks",lasthope83

I remember sleepless night looking up reviews on all antidepressant medications and effexor did really work. Had the worst depression in my short 27 years of life, this medication help me lift up and get back to work. I went on short term disablitly for about two months due to the extreme depression had no interest in life what so ever. Got back to work and even got a promotion several months later. Thank God for this medication and for the strength he gave me through the process.",BC2015
49,Effexor,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 2, 2015",79,"I have experienced chronic anxiety, panic attacks, and depression for 20+ years. I've been on several different medications over the years, but none of them worked entirely. My depression increased over the years, because I believed, nothing could help my problems. I was admitted to a psychiatric unit recently due to suicidal ideations. The attending doctor said he would like to start me on Effexor. I would not allow myself to read the side effects of this medicine, due to my anxiety and the possibility of developing psychosomatic symptoms. Within a week, I began feeling hope, excitement for life, and my anxiety was nearly gone! I've been on this medicine now for over a month, and I have never felt this good my entire life! Try this Med!!!",Reidee
50,Effexor,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,,"February 25, 2015",64,I switched to Effexor after taking Prozac for years and it just didn't seem to be working for me anymore.  I'm so glad My Doctor suggested I switch to Effexor.  I've been taking for about 2 years and it seems to be working great for me.  I very rarely have a down day.  You must take as directed and not miss dosages.  I can't miss more than 1 days dosage or I will get nauseous and dizzy.,Happy Me

52,Effexor,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,,"November 25, 2014",21,"When I first took Effexor I was in the first few days a bit jittery, but then I felt like I hadn't felt in years or ever. It was such a God send. Then with doctors advice after approx 12 mths I went off it.  I went on it two more times,  but my dose was higher and higher- no real help to me. Then a third time, I went off my head on it. The anxiety was woeful, so severe. I phoned up the help line for mental health and got the usual spiel- give it time, yes, it can cause that, speak with you doctor and so on. I read how this can happens then wamo it works. But I had already been on it before and never had such side effects.  It was horrible, and scary.  My personal experience is two opposites. Good and horrible.",Eliza_nsw

54,Effexor,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 10, 2014",60,"I started taking Effexor at age 19 after about 2 1/2 years on Prozac. The reason for the switch was that I developed anxiety problems at that age in addition to depression, and the Prozac was not treating the anxiety. Effexor works very well to treat both anxiety and depression but if I stop taking it for even 1-2 days (which is often because I am very forgetful) I become extremely depressed for the next 1-2 days. Right now I am in one such down swing after taking my Effexor for the first time in about 5 days. If you avoid doing that though you should be fine, the medication does help a lot.",Cherno
55,Effexor,Major Depressive Disorder,7.0,,"May 13, 2014",70,"I give this a 7 because it does work. BUT be very cautious of the side effects. I was on it for 2 years, first started on the regular dose, then switched to extended release as the medicine would ""wear off"" throughout the day. While it helped tremendously with my depression and anxiety (it was almost non-existent) the side effects alone were debilitating. I gained 20 pounds, would fall asleep midday (we're talking I had to pry my eyes open to keep from passing out in the middle of a conversation), I was tired ALL DAY. I sweat PROFUSELY and the dizziness I experienced from missing a dose by only a few minutes, plus the heart palpitations were enough for me to stop. ",Aymie520
