A 30 day supply is $1400, more than my rent.  And this drug has been around well past 10 years. Medicaid won't pay, private insurance won't pay.  Prior authorization all denied.  Just screwed.",Zandieh
1,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 2, 2022",1,"I've taken Trintellix for 2 months now. I was on it once before and worked my way up to 20mg and it worked well. So me and my doctor discussed going on it again, so we dosed it to 10mg and I started it. Trintellix hasn't worked for me this time around. I've been dealing with really difficult suicidal thoughts alongside being in a dissociative state. I've felt so disconnected and sick. The nausea has been so terrible and my appetite and bowel movements have been very little to none. I've also had very strange dreams and I want to sleep all the time. I've also had restless legs as well... If you're looking for a different antidepressant, give it a try. But if you start to see any symptoms talk to your doctor immediately. For me, unfortunately this medication just didn't work.",Nokia

I just couldn't get used to the nausea, which initially went away after an hour or so of taking the tablet but eventually started to linger for longer and longer. Nausea got so bad that I was avoiding taking it so Dr has changed me over to something new.",Bobandy
3,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2022",1,"I hope this helps! I'm on 5 mg for one week then up it to 10mg. I'm very heartened by the positive reviews here. I've been weaning off of Effexor for over a year. Wellbutrin, Prozac, Celexa, Zoloft, Yada, Yada for 36 years. Everything that helped stopped working on my depression and anxiety. I have MDD, GAD, CPTSD, ADHD.. I feel some nausea but hope it goes away. I'm afraid of weight gain and flat mood but can't live with the depression, literally. I hope this works",Katt876
4,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 2, 2022",2,Well first off I have been on everything that there is for depression including TMS therapy. I'm currently doing ketamine but just started it so I have high hopes for it. My next step would be ECT or deep brain stimulation. I had high hopes for Trintellix as well but it made things worse for me. The only good thing I can say is it didn't give me any major psychotic side effects. I gave it a full 3 months at different doses to see if I could find the sweet spot. At lower doses it didn't seem to do anything at and that's not good considering how expensive it is with no generic option. At the 20mg full dosage it made me way more depressed than I already was and gave me constant suicidal thoughts. That's all I thought about for almost 3 weeks. It was terrifying!! I couldn't take it anymore and I knew it was the medication doing it because I wasn't like that before. I lowered the dose back down to 10mg and that went away pretty quick. It was the worst 3 weeks of my life.,Worst med ever!
5,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 31, 2021",2,"I started talking Trintellix 3 weeks ago. Initial dose 5mg up to 15 mg in the third week. It's the worst antidepressant I have ever tried. This what I've been having when I switch to Trintellix I am so dizzy, racing thoughts, and my anxiety is much much worse. I can't eat. I'm even scared to leave the house because I'm so afraid to throw up or have intense diarrhea since . I can't wait to see my psychiatrist next week to stop this madness.",Azizw

7,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 13, 2021",3,"Best medication I have ever been on for MDD. Switched from a Sertraline/Wellbutrin combo mid-breakdown, and Trintellix 10 mg saved me. I had mild nausea the first week, but I have had no other negative side effects to this medication. My weight has not changed in 7 months, and I feel much better physically (since the MDD symptoms have cleared up so well). Truly a life changing medication.",Shelley
8,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 4, 2021",2,"(24 F) I was in a crisis before going into residential treatment, my panic disorder spiralled out of hand. Couldn’t eat, couldn’t work, couldn’t leave my house without having massive panic attacks. I also have a crippling fear of medicine - any in general can’t even take vitamins. Went into residential treatment and I had a genesight test it showed Trintellix was in my green zone. I finally got on it and have been for a month and a half now I stayed on 5 mg for three weeks and now at 10mg. The 5mg took the edge off the depression and anxiety, but the 10 has made me feel so much more stable- I feel almost normal again. I am still In residential so the therapy helps too, but I am so happy I gave it a try. No side effects except some minor constipation and a mild headache that wouldn’t go away for a while. I’m excited to see what more time on this med does for me.",Piper
9,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 1, 2021",2,I have been on Trintellix so far for 10 weeks. I started 5mg for a few days then 10mg for a few weeks and then had some major depression where I couldn't stop crying during my period and my husband was also starting a new job so some family changes were happening. I upped to 15mg and it has helped level me out with my anxiety and depression most of the time but again a month later now and I am at the end of my period and I am a crying mess. Literally crying at work and no my job is not stressful. So I am worried that it is effecting my cycle and making my emotions worse during that time of the month because I don't remember dealing with this on a monthly basis previously. Anyways I am going to stick it out for a few more months because it is working most of the time and helped me get out of a really dark place. Yes you need to take it with food and it made me tired at first so I take it with my dinner. I also got itchy when I upped to 15mg but that went away after a week.,keepontrying
10,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 29, 2021",6,"I have never written a review for a medication before but felt I should share my experience with this one in case it could help someone else. I switched from Zoloft to Trintellix about 9 months ago only because of gaining weight with Zoloft. (Zoloft worked very well for depression and anxiety but I decided to switch to Trintellix per my doctor’s suggestion.) I have taken several different SSRIs before and I will tell you this is by far the worst medication I have ever tried!  It did not work for my depression at all. Unfortunately, I stuck with it and even increased the dosage to the maximum 20 mg., still no improvement. If anything it made me more anxious along with the depression. The side effects of this drug were horrible! The worst ones were severe nausea that never went away, insomnia, and headaches. This medicine basically made me feel much worse than if I was taking nothing for depression. Sadly, I wasted 9 months of my life on this awful medication. On to Lexapro!",Anonymous
11,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 23, 2021",2,I started the trial of Trintelix in January and at first it really helped me to get up and get going but then the bad nausea started where I’d literally have to run to the restroom and sometimes almost not make it. I have Fibromyalgia and IBS so this has really started to wear me down. I feel it has made me worse than better. I’m back to how I was feeling before plus now not looking forward to titrating this out my system,Beck

16,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 10, 2021",14,"I've had Major Depressive Disorder for a decade. I've tried so many kinds of medication that I lost track. I was seriously looking into electro-convulsive therapy, that's how desperate I was for help. Thankfully, my psychiatrist wanted me to try Trintellix instead. I cannot emphasize enough how much better I feel. I'm not isolating myself away anymore, I'm not neglecting responsibilities like I had been, and I actually feel excited about my future (something I couldn't imagine feeling before Trintellix). I can't say enough good things. To be completely transparent to, I have also been doing equine therapy. It has definitely helped as well, but this has made me well enough to be able to take on the responsibility of having my OWN horse, so the Trintellix + my horse = my depression is at an all-time low and life is looking goodI have had no side effects, it's easy to take (but expensive without insurance), and I definitely recommend it",-ACM-

18,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 21, 2021",14,"This medication has worked very well for me. My symptoms included severe suicidal ideation. At one point, I was even placed on lithium, which is supposedly the best drug there is for suicidal ideation. Lithium didn’t work for me. I’d given up hope after that. Then, a new psychiatrist gave me samples of Trintellix. I’ve been on it for three months and have seen major improvement. I feel alive again. I’ll note that the first week, I had bad nausea after my nightly dose. Then, I went up to 10mg and it continued. However, it eventually went away after about a week. When I made an increase to 20mg after that, the nausea returned, but this time only for a few days. I almost gave up the first night, but am glad I didn’t. I haven’t had a med help this much in a long time. This one replaced Zoloft, which had stopped working for me. I would never be able to afford it without insurance, though.",My_Mayberry

The nausea lasted close to an hour.  I broke out in a rash on my right side within a week of starting it. My personality changed so drastically and NOT for the better! I was incredibly angry, mean and downright miserable.  I started crying over anything and everything and I have NEVER been a crier. After a month I told my Doctor, no more!

20,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,,"June 28, 2021",49,"I have been on 20 mg of trintellix for 6 weeks now, and it has helped me tremendously. Previously, I was on the maximum dose of sertraline for 2.5 years. It worked well, but I experienced a flattening of my emotions, low sex drive and restless leg syndrome. After a major bout of severe depression about 6 months after getting off sertraline, I tried lexapro but it made me sleep all day. My doctor suggested trintellix, and I've never been happier with an antidepressant. I noticed an increase in motivation after a week. At 4-5 weeks, I felt like myself when I'm well. I am (so far) not experiencing a single side effect. I had mild nausea at the beginning, but that's it. I know everyone's experiences with medication is highly individualized, but as a trauma survivor who does ""everything right"" (exercise, therapy, nutrition, etc) and still experiences severe depression, I am so grateful to have found trintellix.

It was hard switching over, I went thru a lot of emotions, crying, laughing, anger. It was strange. Then for about a week I felt nothing I was flat. No emotions. About a week long of being emotionless I felt normal again. This was being on 10 mg. Then I started to feel worthless etc, still have anxiety and I still have to take my clonazepam for it. My Dr. upped my med to 20mg, I feel a bit anxious, kind of edgy. Is this normal? I would maybe expect it to be since he doubled it, but I have been on 20 for 5 days now and I feel like tapering back to 10. Anyone have this experience going up?",Kells80

Trintellix was ok for me. I realised that I was also just feeling ok on it. I wanted to feel better then ok. I spoke to my Doc about it, she added Bupropion with Trintellix. The Bupropion was bad for me. She is now switching me from Trintellix to Effexor XR. I shall see if this is better.",NoName
23,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 14, 2021",25,"I have tried every single antidepressant on the market over the past 10 years. They either did not work or caused terrible side effects or I needed a booster med usually an antipsychotic to make it work. I gained 60lbs in 3 years taking other meds. My doctor at first gave me 5mg of Trintellix and then upped me to 10. At 10mg I still needed the booster meds. She upped me to 15mg and took me off the booster meds. I lost around 15lbs and was feeling somewhat better. After upping me 6 weeks ago to 20mg (maximum dose) I am feeling fantastic. Lots of energy, positive thoughts, enjoying life for the first time in 10 years. I have been on Trintellix in some form for almost 5 years and it took that long to get the dosage right. I am grateful for my doctor for sticking with me until we finally found the right combination. I feel like I have a whole new life right now. Trintellix did not cause me weight gain.

And I have become very scatter brained and absent minded – I have trouble completing simple tasks and trouble with simple spelling.  My libido is significantly reduced with accompanying anorgasmia.  Overall, my mood has been very up and down.  I short, my vortioxetine experience so far has been like riding the Kingda Ka roller coaster on acid with a psilocybin mushroom chaser.",Flooby

(Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Celexa) I can tell my mood has been brighter, I sleep better, my sex drive has came back and I'm way less agitated. I have more patience and I listen better now as well. This drug really does work for me and I highly recommend it! My appetite has decreased and I've been noticing slight weight loss only after one month or being on it. One negative side effect is slight nausea in the mornings sometimes, but it quickly goes away if it does happen. My insurance doesn't cover it, but there is a Savings program card that works wonderfully! I only pay $10 for the prescription and I'm on 10 MG.",Jessi
26,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 31, 2021",3,"I’ve had the strangest encounter with this medication. I’ve been on it for three weeks now and I found myself with the worst nausea and panic attacks. At first it seemed like I was responding well . I felt energized right away & even lost weight since I was no longer taking Lexapro. By the third week, I found myself having panic attacks and rage throughout the day. I’ve also had sporadic thoughts of suicide and found myself spiralling into a dark hole. I got so trapped in my head that I truly thought I was worthless and at no point felt the medication played a role in my mood swings.  I guess it’s been so bad that others have seen the drastic change in my behavior, I had two friends reach out telling me they are worried about me. I’m happy for those experiencing great results with this medication because this medication has been a nightmare for me. I for once was happy about not gaining weight right away but I it seems like I just need to go back on Lexapro.",Janelle

TMS did work but the result doesn’t last. Finally almost out of options I was prescribed Trintellix. It’s the only antidepressant I’ve ever taken that after a couple of weeks I thought ‘wow this really has an effect!’ Haven’t really any side effects. However, it is EXPENSIVE! They have a savings card but it only takes up to $100 off. So it was $400/mo after insurance and the savings card. My doc suggested getting it from Canada and I did! $269 for 3 months!

29,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,,"February 3, 2021",9,I’ve had a good experience on this medication so far unlike a lot of other depression medications I’ve tried. I haven’t had any side effects. The only annoying thing about this medication is it interacts with a lot of other medications so if you’re sick you won’t be able to take cough syrup of any kind and will have to stick to nasal sprays and a humidifier basically. I would not recommend it with alcohol as you probably already know as you get drunk a lot faster.,Lily

When I ate a heavy meal when taking a dose, the nausea seemed to improve slightly. But the other side effects were unacceptable. I feel anxious beyond belief, frustrated constantly, borderline manic, and to make things worse, I'm always itchy. I can go to work but can't do my job properly.

Doctor placed me on Trintellix, 10mg.  Was kind enough to give me samples until I got coverage.  Had a bit of a setback and fell into a depression six months later.   Was boosted to 20mg and now I am doing fantastic.  Depressive episodes do come back for a few days at a time but they are easier to handle if you get back in routine and force yourself.

33,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 2, 2021",11,"This drug Trintellix is rubbish. I started it on December 1st at 5 mg and increased to 10 mg by day 5. I kept trying to get to 15 mg because even after 2.5 weeks I wasn’t noticing any improvement in my anxiety. Maybe some in my depression. During the first week I did have suicidal thoughts and consistent panic attacks. Loss of appetite. Always tired and couldn’t shut my brain off. This medicine did work for my mom, but for me after giving it four weeks I threw in the towel. Only reason I took this was because after taking 20 mg of lexapro for over 6 years I had a poop out and was beginning to have increased anxiety snd suicidal thoughts by November 23rd. I’m now on celexa which is similar to lexapro and just as effective (will write another review on that). Trintellix may help with depression but won’t help anxiety. I was still crying a lot during the month on Trintellix. Everyone is different though so it’s worth the go. Sadly mine was a wasted experiment and I’m back to square 1.",Dmccuddles27

I took it starting Nov 9 I only took it for 5 days before I ended up passing out on it. I started off at 5mg pills and during the time I took them I felt like I was high on speed. My pupils were wide, I was restless, paranoid, hallucinating, couldn’t sleep, zero appetite and nauseous. Eventually it all became too much and I passed out from one of the many severe panic attacks it gave me. The withdrawal even after only taking them for 5 days was terrifying.

After the second week, I took 10 mg. During the six week when I broke up with my boyfriend and everything felt apart. The medication stopped working and my depression got worse. I was on the way to kill myself. Everything was so serious and I  decided to go back to my home town where is my family and therapist. For 3 weeks I have been on Effexor XR and I cannot say I see a positive change but I feel hopeful that things will change for the better. I rate Trintelix with 2 because it had awful side effects and it didn't help me at the end. I wish luck to everyone reading this. You are not alone!",SD

To the administrators...re depression sucks, I accidentally hit the report this button and DID NOT MEAN TO; I’m so sorry! I have the shakes since being on Trintellix and my finger hit the wrong button. And btw, I have diagnosed OCD, GAD and major depression. I’ve had nausea, constipation, poor appetite, shaking, change in smell since taking this drug & no relief from the depression, OCD or anxiety.  I’m getting scared because I have been on so many and the best was Cipralex...it worked fantastically...for about 6 weeks and then just stopped.   It was absolutely wonderful. For all 3 of my issues... I’ve heard these types of pills can stop being effective after awhile but only after 6 weeks!?   Very disappointing. However, I see my psychiatrist next month and until then I’ll keep on with the Trintellix .I’m so glad to hear that it works for some people.

I ended up in the ER 3 weeks ago because I was struggling to get a deep breath.  After thorough testing, it was determined nothing was wrong.  Deep search on Trintellix side effects made it clear the problem was this medication.  I am now taking every other day until next week when I meet with my doctor.

It has dramatically lifted my depression and anxiety and has helped me enjoy life, interacting with friends, etc. It seems to hit all the right brain receptors for me. I went up to 20mg but didn't need it; 10mg was enough and there are less sexual side effects at 10mg. Low dose is enough to get my neurotransmitters functioning - no need to go higher. It might have taken me a little longer to get there due to the slower titration, but definitely worth it.

Have had major depression & generalized anxiety since childhood. Started on Effexor XR in the 1990's. It seemed to quit working and so I started Trintellex 5mg then up to 10mg now at 20mg.  All was great till recently; it feels like 20mg isn't enough. Depression is back full force. I take another medication for anxiety. I'm wondering if there is another medication that can be used as an adjunct to 20mg Trintellex which doesn't make me gain 12 lbs. like Rexalti did several years ago. Seeing prescriber in a few days; will see what she says.,Courtney Blair
91,Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 28, 2019",45,"Will probably update later when I’ve been on longer, but so far it’s been very helpful. I’ve been on several antidepressants over the last decade (only one has ever worked and had to be discontinued due to worsening side effects) and had no problem getting approval from insurance. I started on 5 mg for a week and had slight nausea on days 2-5 a couple of hours after taking with food that lasted about 20-30 minutes. I’ve been on 10 mg for a week and no nausea. It’s actually improved my IBS. Appetite has been the same. My depression symptoms mainly manifest as fatigue/exhaustion, brain fog, forgetfulness, lack of motivation. I feel great, I’m motivated, I’ve been working out, getting more done at work and at home, sleeping less (now I’m sleeping more like 8 hours instead of 10-12). My out of pocket is $100 for a 30 day supply of 10 mg, I’m looking in to bringing the cost down, but if I can’t it’ll be well worth it for how good I feel.",Char

I think I just need a higher dose. Aly mentioned feeling restless leg but in her whole body. Aly I have that feeling I call it Restless body syndrome. A sleep study showed my alpha intrusion waves were TEXT BOOK for. Fibromyalgia can cause depression. No cure, just treating symptoms. I take klonopin at bedtime to allow my body to relax, stop the mind racing and it seems to do well. Talk to your physician about a sleep study. It does help. However, don’t have fibromyalgia put in your chart.  Make a list and don’t let your dr rush you. You are important and your mental health is more important than ANYTHING.",HJ

I had increased energy and mood within a couple weeks, started being able to be more active, and was able to think about the future without feeling overwhelmed. It was amazing. I've had depression for years and had forgotten what it felt like to actually be interested in life and not feel like dying every time I woke up in the morning. Side effects have been minimal: lots of nausea that has contributed to some weight loss but not enough to be worrisome, and it lowered my libido and made it slightly harder to orgasm. Compared to other things I tried the side effects are hardly noticeable! BMI: 19.1, Trintellix 15mg daily.

Along with the insomnia, my mood has gotten worse, I have increased anxiety  and my fatigue has obviously worsened due to no sleep from the insomnia. I did not have any issues with nausea as so many others have had. I am very torn as to whether I should continue taking the Trintellix because I know just over a week is not nearly enough time to get the full effect and results, but I definitely feel like I have taken a big step backwards from how I felt on the zoloft.

No side effects. He also put me on 10mg Dexedrin 3x a day for ADHD which was previously untreated and the combination has been amazing. I told my wife it's like jogging your whole life with ankle and wrist weights on and then all of a sudden someone removes them. That's the mental change I've felt on this drug combination. My depression scores have reduced from about 20-30 to 2 as of today. I hesitate to use the term ""miracle drug."" But it has definitely been an answer to prayer.",Thadius Watkins

Within six months of beginning Trintellix, I began experiencing constipation, stomach pains, and mild joint pain. The symptoms were so bad, my Dr had my gall bladder removed. Nothing has changed. Now, I can’t help but connect the symptoms to Trintellix- can’t be 100% sure, though.

I liked that it claimed to have no impact on weight, as many other drugs have weight gain. All I can say is there’s a reason the pharma companies spend what they do to advertise a drug so heavily. It’s because they are trying to generate business for a marginally effective drug. I took the lowest dosage and felt it helped my depression marginally. The issue was it gave me severe insomnia. I’d go to bed at my normal time and just lay there wide awake, almost manic, which was due solely to Trintellix. This was taking the medicine in the AM upon waking, not at night. Unfortunately, I could not handle the insomnia, especially for an only marginal improvement and got myself off this terrible drug.",cmcdallas

I was on 60mg Cymbalta, titrated Brintellix to 10mg, but experienced discomfort  (heightened anxiety and weird burning feeling.)  I lowered Cymbalta dose to 30mg a day, an immediate relief from the anxiety. However it crept back,  and I concluded it was an interaction leading to accumulation of Brintellix and went back to 5mg of it. Now after three months I start to get used to that it actually works. Only discomfort is occasionally feeling nauseous (after eating sweets  or pastry on an empty stomach.) 60mg Cymbalta helped me for years with depression and anxiety, however leaving me foggy.

I also noticed some mild scalp tingling which another person mentioned.) No sexual side effects, no weight gain, no TMJ, no night sweats!
