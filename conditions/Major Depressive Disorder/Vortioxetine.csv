I was on it once before and worked my way up to 20mg and it worked well. So me and my doctor discussed going on it again, so we dosed it to 10mg and I started it. Trintellix hasn't worked for me this time around. I've been dealing with really difficult suicidal thoughts alongside being in a dissociative state. I've felt so disconnected and sick. The nausea has been so terrible and my appetite and bowel movements have been very little to none. I've also had very strange dreams and I want to sleep all the time. I've also had restless legs as well... If you're looking for a different antidepressant, give it a try. But if you start to see any symptoms talk to your doctor immediately. For me, unfortunately this medication just didn't work.",Nokia

4,Vortioxetine,Major Depressive Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 2, 2022",2,Trintellix (vortioxetine):Well first off I have been on everything that there is for depression including TMS therapy. I'm currently doing ketamine but just started it so I have high hopes for it. My next step would be ECT or deep brain stimulation. I had high hopes for Trintellix as well but it made things worse for me. The only good thing I can say is it didn't give me any major psychotic side effects. I gave it a full 3 months at different doses to see if I could find the sweet spot. At lower doses it didn't seem to do anything at and that's not good considering how expensive it is with no generic option. At the 20mg full dosage it made me way more depressed than I already was and gave me constant suicidal thoughts. That's all I thought about for almost 3 weeks. It was terrifying!! I couldn't take it anymore and I knew it was the medication doing it because I wasn't like that before. I lowered the dose back down to 10mg and that went away pretty quick. It was the worst 3 weeks of my life.,Worst med ever!

8,Vortioxetine,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 4, 2021",2,"Trintellix (vortioxetine):(24 F) I was in a crisis before going into residential treatment, my panic disorder spiralled out of hand. Couldn’t eat, couldn’t work, couldn’t leave my house without having massive panic attacks. I also have a crippling fear of medicine - any in general can’t even take vitamins. Went into residential treatment and I had a genesight test it showed Trintellix was in my green zone. I finally got on it and have been for a month and a half now I stayed on 5 mg for three weeks and now at 10mg. The 5mg took the edge off the depression and anxiety, but the 10 has made me feel so much more stable- I feel almost normal again. I am still In residential so the therapy helps too, but I am so happy I gave it a try. No side effects except some minor constipation and a mild headache that wouldn’t go away for a while.

9,Vortioxetine,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 1, 2021",2,Trintellix (vortioxetine):I have been on Trintellix so far for 10 weeks. I started 5mg for a few days then 10mg for a few weeks and then had some major depression where I couldn't stop crying during my period and my husband was also starting a new job so some family changes were happening. I upped to 15mg and it has helped level me out with my anxiety and depression most of the time but again a month later now and I am at the end of my period and I am a crying mess. Literally crying at work and no my job is not stressful. So I am worried that it is effecting my cycle and making my emotions worse during that time of the month because I don't remember dealing with this on a monthly basis previously. Anyways I am going to stick it out for a few more months because it is working most of the time and helped me get out of a really dark place. Yes you need to take it with food and it made me tired at first so I take it with my dinner. I also got itchy when I upped to 15mg but that went away after a week.,keepontrying

(Zoloft worked very well for depression and anxiety but I decided to switch to Trintellix per my doctor’s suggestion.) I have taken several different SSRIs before and I will tell you this is by far the worst medication I have ever tried!  It did not work for my depression at all. Unfortunately, I stuck with it and even increased the dosage to the maximum 20 mg., still no improvement. If anything it made me more anxious along with the depression. The side effects of this drug were horrible! The worst ones were severe nausea that never went away, insomnia, and headaches.

I'm not isolating myself away anymore, I'm not neglecting responsibilities like I had been, and I actually feel excited about my future (something I couldn't imagine feeling before Trintellix). I can't say enough good things. To be completely transparent to, I have also been doing equine therapy.

I’ll note that the first week, I had bad nausea after my nightly dose. Then, I went up to 10mg and it continued. However, it eventually went away after about a week. When I made an increase to 20mg after that, the nausea returned, but this time only for a few days. I almost gave up the first night, but am glad I didn’t.

If your psychiatrist is proposing this drug as an option, it's worth trying in spite of the reviews on here because everyone is different. Trintellix worked better than Escitalopram for preventing brain fog IMO . The clouds lifted and it's been great for that. That being said, your dreams will become more vivid and the first few weeks are nausea city, but that side effect is reduced and then disappears over time.Also unlike most other antidepressants I've taken, Trintellix is extremely time sensitive. If I take it an hour later or earlier than the day before, I really feel the side effects. The other SSRIs I took did not have those sort of compunctions. My brain literally clouds up if I'm a few hours late taking the med, so keep that in mind and your experience will be better. My libido is still normal, and my functioning has improved.

I did the genetic testing after my experience on Trintillex and found that I have a genetic expression where my brain does not utilize serotonin very well due to fewer receptor sites (SSRI's are not good for me- it's the SLC6A4 gene if you are curious). Trintillex has a very high effects on serotonin receptor sites, so I did not do well on it at all.  I had racing/hypo-manic thoughts, itching, higher appetite with food and sex, tinnitus, loose stools, insomnia, nausea, and very high energy.  I would highly recommend doing the genetic test through your PCP or Psychiatrist/Nurse Practitioner to determine your specific needs due to your specific genetics.
