0,Wellbutrin XL,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 7, 2022",3,I have been on this med for about 7 months (150mg). Initially made me feel great with little side effects and it still does.  I smoked weed for about 4 of those 7 months until I quit cold turkey 2 months ago. I think the weed negated the rise in anxiety that wellbutrin usually gives.  Wellbutrin is known to increase anxiety so be weary but it can wear off in a couple of weeks to months. For me I take it with Clonazepam as needed but I take it daily almost because of the constant anxiety. For me I am not addicted cause I am on such a low dose (1mg) but I would like to try Buspar which I prob will. This pill gave me my motivation back that I lost for about 6 years. It allows me to get out of bed and not feel pity or sorry for myself. I usually take it in the mornings. BUT if you have GAD be weary as it can make your anxiety worse. But the way it makes you feel motivated can outweigh the crazy anxiety it can give.,nat
1,Wellbutrin XL,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 10, 2022",1,"I fortunately saw all the reviews and thought wow this medication looks like a godsend. I was on this medication for about 3 years by the last year and a half I started having a skin rash like severely and felt like where my nerves were all being hurt and in pain. Then I was having big holes in my skin and I had gained probably 70 80 lb I started at 130lb I went to 205lb by the end of it. I have gotten off this I've been off at for a week I have already lost 10 lb and I feel so much better I feel like my clarity is there I can actually feel things, like my libidos back - I have a sex drive, I didn't realise how much this medication had taken so much from me. Not everyone has the same experience on this I actually have less cravings to smoke off of it than I did on it. I smoked a lot on this medication now I'm barely smoking. So don't just go by everyone's 10 out of 10 review please be sure to see the red flags and the signs that come up because I didn't I kept thinking it was something else it was something else finally I stopped  it and ya :",Wellbutrin xl

4,Wellbutrin XL,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 3, 2021",1,"I was dealing with mega anxiety that was starting to turn into a deep depression.  I got on Wellbutrin about 2 months ago.  I started with 150 mg and  went to 300 in a little over a week.  I had minimal side effects.  I did notice the first few days and after the dose increase that I felt a little buzzy and had good energy.  I was concerned it would make my anxiety worse; it didn't.  Unfortunately, it didn't do enough for my anxiety (which it isn't usually used for that, which is why I'm still giving it a 9/10).  It pulled me out of a very dark hole, but I really needed something more geared towards anxiety.   Probably wasn't the best choice of meds for me, IMO.  But I really think it could be great for others especially with depression and low energy",SLB22
5,Wellbutrin XL,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 16, 2021",2,My only sister was tragically killed in 2009 which put me in a deep dark depressed state. Unhappy always crying didn’t wanna get out of bed. Distant from everyone I basically shut the world out. This went on for 7 years or so. I finally told my doctor I was at the end of my rope and she gave me a prescription for 150 of wellbutrin XL it sat there for months because I didn’t want to depend on medicine to make me feel human again. Then I started to take it and it made me feel slightly better and then the thoughts came back in and I went back to my doctor and and told her so she upped my dosage to 300mg and I noticed a huge change but at first but I started to notice I was happier and smiling more I was getting up doing stuff and I started letting the world back in . I’ve probably been on it 3 years now and honestly I’m not sure I can function without it because I’m afraid of sinking back down to my lows again .,Grace

During that time, one of my depression side effects was overeating and weight grain. After about a year of taking it, I just continued because I had a lot of hair loss and thinning. My hair has grown back since I stopped taking it 6 months ago, however, I felt my mood and energy decline. I asked my doctor to please put me back on, which he has. It has only been a week and I feel wonderful. My cravings are pretty much cut, I used to eat a lot of candy and chips as comfort food. Yesterday, I was craving something sweet and only had one mini twix and was satisfied. I'm now convinced that Wellbutrin actually does work for weight loss, however, I've not lost any weight this first week the way others have.",Vee

I found myself constantly fatigued, absolutely no libido and gaining weight. I'm a 44 yr, 145 lb, female. Day one I noticed immediate effect such as a calmness and I wasn't as sad. Keep in mind, I took a month off from no meds at all. I wanted to give my body time to adjust with not having the Lexapro in my system. Day 2 and 3, I noticed my appetite was suppressed. I wasn't as hungry as I was before. I have also been experiencing a slight headache. I am also dealing with insomnia.

Doctor put me on 300mg XL generic starting yesterday, and fingers crossed that I get back to where I was before. Sad to say that the previous dose pooped out. I guess that’s how a lot of these meds go. Got up early this morning, very unusual for me, but happened when I first started Wellbutrin.

I’ve been upped to 300mg now and it’s only gotten worse. Hazy, tired, can’t cry, twitching.

17,Wellbutrin XL,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 9, 2020",18,"Seven years ago the anti-depressant I was on stopped working, and I crashed into horrible major depressive disorder. My new doctor, guessing (wrong) that I had Bipolar Depression (I didn't), took me off anti-depressants and put me on Latuda, an ""atypical anti-psychotic"" often used to control Bipolar Depression. Not only didn't help the depression but also made me pace uncontrollable. I switched doctors, and the new one put me on Wellbutrin XL (long-acting). Eventually, my depression cleared, and I've been relatively depression-free (there are bad patches with any drug) for the past 7 years. I've had no noticeable side-effects, and I take it with first thing in the morning breakfast so it doesn't interfere with my sleep. I highly recommend it. (Full disclosure: I also take Imipramine, an old ""tricyclic"" anti-depressant, a couple of hours before bedtime. Helps me sleep well but dry-mouth side effect is annoying & bad for my teeth.)",John

When I started this my anxiety got worse then better then worse again, my doctor prescribed me buspar for my anxiety it did end up helping for a short time until recently. I had a very awful and my first panic attack. I decided to get off Wellbutrin as my anxiety was at an all time high. The withdrawal symptoms are not so great, but I’m glad I’m off of it.

My motivation went back to a normal level and I started painting, drawing and cooking again. My only issue was that I started getting daily headaches (after I had been on it for six months). My doctor put me on 150mg which got rid of the headaches, but my motivation got worse. I felt like I could do things I couldn’t when depressed, but also like I needed to convince myself to do anything extra. My doctor then gave me 5mg of lexapro on top of the Wellbutrin and its good. Recently got my blood work done for being fatigued, sleeping a LOT and brain cloudiness - its because I have a severe vitamin D deficiency. I highly recommend getting your bloodwork done if you feel like this suddenly loses effectiveness. A low vitamin D level can also cause depression which probably made it harder for me to feel better even on medications.

After I started Wellbutrin 150mg, positive signs started just after few days after, peak was after 4-5 weeks. Wellbutrin gives energy and motivation to do things. The only drawback is that this energy sometimes continues even after midnight.

The bad news is I started feeling tingling and numbness in my hands and feet. This feeling did not go away. I also experiences nausea, vomiting, severe agitation and general malaise. After 5 weeks of being on Wellbutrin I called my doctor and told her my symptoms. She has put me on Effexor but I can't start the medication till my symptoms go away which I hope will be soon cause I think my family has about had it with me this last month. I hope Effexor helps and soon! Take care everyone!",beachcat71
91,Wellbutrin XL,Major Depressive Disorder,6.0,,"December 16, 2015",40,"I started taking bupropion XL 150mg a day I took that for a month, the first 3 weeks I felt kind of cloudy/lost, had a little bit of anxiety and had some pretty bad ups and downs with my depression but by the end of the month I felt a lot better and didn't even feel like I was on a medication at all. I just started my second month and was upped to a 300mg dose. I'm on my 5th day and so far have had really bad anxiety attacks feeling like I'm losing control/ stuck in my own head most of the time and sleeping a lot. I'm hoping I can stick it out like with the 150 and start feeling normal again. I almost quit in the first 3 weeks of 150 but I stuck it out after reading positive reviews and it got better. I'm hoping that happens with the 300mg.",Kotilour

For me it definitely got worse before it got better. Around the second and third month my anxiety had me on edge and I had a very short temper. The positive definitely outweighed the negative though. I'm no longer sleeping all day, I finally have the energy to workout and carryout basic activities, and no more emotional eating. As a result I've lost 25 pounds and it has really helped me with my confidence. Not everyday is great but thats just part of life. I'm no longer irritable and my anxiety is not perfect, but manageable. I finally feel like I'm taking control of my life. If you can stick it out past the 3 month mark I think it's worth a try",abcanadagirl

My freshman year I started taking Lexapro. It was the worst possible thing that could've happened to me. Worst side effects ever. I gained over 40 pounds. I was tiny and petite to being around 125 to 170. Tried switching from many multiple different meds, still gained weight. Then my doctor finally put me on Wellbutrin, started off with the low dose and didn't really help much. She upped me to 150. I had hyperglycemia and finally got over it and got off of metformin. I am starting to finally lose some of that weight and about to look great for senior year. I highly recommend this medicine. It makes me not hungry anymore. I'm so happy now!",Michelle f

It comes in doses from 75mg immediate release up to 300mg extended release. Due to the stimulant effect it has, you may need to ease into it! Everybody is different.

I have lots of energy, (sometimes, too much). It doesn't help with my anxiety; I still need Klonopin now and then. It also gives me insomnia, again, the Klonopin helps there.
