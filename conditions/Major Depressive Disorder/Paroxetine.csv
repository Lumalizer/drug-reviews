0,Paroxetine,Major Depressive Disorder,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 23, 2021",2,"Was on paxil 40mg for 6 years, I've had major depression from losing a child and awful panic attacks that floored me. Just before Halloween I had a break through attack. I was also using an inhaler when I didn't really need it so I got crazy shaky and one thing led to another, worst attack I'd had in many many many years. I heard that SSRI sometimes quit working, so of course that was with my case. Dr prescribed 20mg lexapro instead of my paxil. Boy was I wrong, I'd have intermittent attacks here and their, now last 4 days I've been in ER twice. Both because of panic attacks. I convinced my Dr I wanted back on paxil at 40mg. Took my 2nd dose today, I felt better this morning after only 1 dose of paxil. I'll never take lexapro again. 40mg paxil saved my life without a doubt. Now I have to wait another 4 to 6 weeks for it to fully work, just after I waited 6 weeks for lexapro not to work.",Paxil A+++++

It really helps with my mood and racing thoughts. I’m less anxious too. I was on Zoloft for a couple years before and it worked great but I noticed the benefits started to wear off, so my psychiatrist decided to put me on this. I’m very thankful. For some reason certain SSRI's work better than others; everyone is different. I tried lexapro and had horrible depression from it. All I can say is don’t give up until you find what works for you.",2002z288

My doctor switched me to Paxil CR and I haven't experienced any side effects from the extended release version.  It absolutely helps by keeping me out of a depressive episode.  Paxil is really the only antidepressant that works for me according to a DNA test I had done.  Paxil CR has changed my life for the better.,Moetheiguana

It takes awhile for it to kick-in. Once you feel the benefits of Paxil, you will notice. The pros for me are higher then the cons (side effects). This week is my first week at 37.5 (Paxil ER). I took 30mg for 3-4 years. I’m really excited to start this mew dosage. It’s hard to find the right SSRI, I went through a few brands and dosages years ago.

I was on Paxil briefly when I was 14, but stopped it due to insurance problems. I started it again a couple of months ago and it has been incredible. I started out at a dose 10mg, had some nausea but nothing major and it went away after a couple of weeks. I've now been on 20mg dose for almost three weeks and am experiencing some nausea again and headaches, but emotionally, I feel fantastic. I didn't have a severe PTSD anniversary reaction this year thanks to this medication. I feel good. I care about things. I feel like I can handle setbacks without wanting to just give up.

Still ask your doctor if this combination is right for you because it doesn't help everyone. Start slow and you don't need a high dose either.

16,Paroxetine,Major Depressive Disorder,7,,"October 26, 2019",17,"Paxil (paroxetine):Paxil literally saved my life. This fast acting pills can get you feeling better in as little as a week. It helped me get completely stable & after years I finally felt what happiness was once again. I cannot rate this life saving pill a 10 due to its side effects. Paxil 30mg helped me to reconnect with myself once again and feel at peace but every single day I would wake up with serious nausea. Also, weight gain is a strong factor to look out for as I gained 40lbs in just one year on it. It also took a toll on my sex drive but that wasn't a major problem since I was single at the moment. Although paxil has its side effects its such a life changing pill, I decided to deal with them. I then got switched to Effexor 150mg ER yet it gave me a terrible relapse that I ended up in a psychiatric institution. I'm now on Wellbutrin XL 150mg & seem to be feeling fine, but thank you Paxil for saving my life in a time of desperate need.",Nat

It caused a more severe depression and rageful episodes which destroyed a wonderful relationship with my boyfriend. After taking it for less than a month, I could not breath and fell unconscious and had a seizure. It was also prescribed for hot flashes which didn't work either. In addition, it caused nausea and flu-like symptoms and 10lb weight gain. I felt worse than ever and it had a deleterious effect on my life.Horrible drug!",Sunshine

Within a couple months of starting I was able to get a job, something I couldn't do before. I found myself feeling more confident and caring less about things that used to worry me. However, Paxil unfortunately hasn't helped with my depression. And while the side effects I have experienced (sexual dysfunction, vivid dreams, drowsiness) are pretty minor, the withdrawals are insane. My insurance screwed up and I missed my meds for a couple of days and it was a nightmare. I was angry, anxious, suicidal. I had constant brain zaps and could hardly sleep. So be careful with this one. Don't miss any doses and try to take it at the same time every day. And if you want to quit, TAKE IT SLOW.",Sarammmmtia

26,Paroxetine,Major Depressive Disorder,6,,"September 3, 2017",4,"Pros: felt great quickly, kept me fairly level for a few years before poopout. Cons: SEVERE withdrawal and ANGER and AGITATION. Upon reflection, the past 3 years on Paxil were also filled with inappropriate anger to the point of rage, uncontrollable outbursts that I've never experienced before. I isolated my loved ones, lost my partner and became a recluse as I feared my emotions. Didn't realize this until I reconnected with loved ones. Gained 40 lbs, despite a healthy diet and exercise. Joint pain, muscle loss. Yuck.Had to switch to Lexapro to come off this drug, and lead an antihistamine/anti inflammatory diet (huge contributors to mood disorders--eye opening discovery). It smoothed out the ride but I still suffered ""Paxil Rage"".",MASFL77

The only side effect I have is weight gain. It will cause withdrawal if you stop taking it for a week which happened once when I didnt get my script refilled. But all in all its helped me greatly. I'd rather have weight gain than severe depression and anxiety and fear of crowds. I give it a 10 for my case.,LadyEcho

33,Paroxetine,Major Depressive Disorder,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 24, 2016",2,I am a 31 year old female. Paroxatine definitely helped my mood but it made me lethargic and I gained about a kilo a month for the five months I was on it. I was unhappy about the weight gain so I tapered off very slowly and didn't have any serious side effects besides being a bit emotional for a week. Losing the weight seems to be harder than it was before I took the medication. It didn't help my mood anymore than sertraline or Effexor did and the side effects of those were far more tolerable than so much weight gain.,Lanna315

Along with others here I found it to help out heaps after a period of months, you could not measure the change from this week to last week but rather this month compared to 3 months ago and there was a noticeable positive difference in my mind. The last 6 or so months however I feel like I've plateaued and don't feel as they they are helping me with my inner struggles as much anymore. Definitely saved my life though as I was in a bad bad way. A bit of weight gain but if that's the price for getting better I can handle that :)",Rob N
