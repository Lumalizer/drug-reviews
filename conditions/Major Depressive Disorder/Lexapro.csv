1,Lexapro,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 9, 2022",1,"I was on Prozac + Paxil as a teen and ugh not great. Found prozac and took a baby dose- 10mg- and it helped my mood, anxiety, irritability, anger, motivation, apathy, isolation, depression… then it stopped working as sometimes happens. I was nervous to switch as it was helpful at one time. We switched to Lexapro as it’s similar and within 2 weeks less depressed, a month mostly recovered, 2 months as good as it’s gonna get:) Noticed 0 side effects and I usually have side effects. I notice I can sleep better, but also struggle with wanting to stop sleeping:) It’s almost too easy to sleep, so it needs a behavioral solution, or I can take halved pills every other day to see:) I don’t feel tired or groggy or even sleepy, it’s just easy for me to fall asleep at rest:) I love this med! It’s brought me back from a pretty big depressive episode.",Anonymous

I take the generic version but the first few weeks are going to be ROUGH. I was feeling nauseous 24/7, getting daily headaches, anxiety, and insomnia. It’s worth it. If you can stick out the first couple of weeks it is awesome. I’ve never felt better about myself and I can actually focus on my tasks and get out of bed.

Insomnia,  no sleep,  restless to the point of exhaustion.  Begin to hear my brain sounding  like white noise, more depressed and suicidal  thoughts.   In bed all day. Horrible experience i had  no libido,  unable to have orgasm.  Doing better after 10 days off this.   Not worth it.",J.c.
7,Lexapro,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 25, 2021",8,"I was prescribed Lexapro for severe long term anxiety and depression. Even though it didn't work on my depression after 5 months of use, I wanted to leave it a positive review, since these drugs have the power to save peoples lives.  Initially I experienced basically every side effect possible. Nausea, loss of appetite, night sweats, bad vivid dreams, changes to taste, dizzy, short term memory loss, inability to orgasm, blurred vision in the morning, heart palpitations, headaches, extreme moments of anxiety to the point of throwing up, extreme depression to the point of having to sleep all day. But you know what - this list of side effects sounds horrible, but they are worth it if you start to feel even a little bit like yourself again. After about a month the side effects decreased in severity, my anxiety was gone, but still left me with the inability to orgasm and had no impact on my depression. I've now moved to Cymbalta (SNRI) and will review that in a few months.",Lilly
8,Lexapro,Major Depressive Disorder,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 17, 2021",8,"I was prescribed lexapro for anxiety and depression, also OCD.  Side effects of terrible dry mouth, headaches. It did however, help my insomnia. Months in, my anxiety had slightly subsided and my depression was noticeably gone. But I wasn’t happy either, honestly I felt numb. Doctor upped my dose to 20mg about 4/5 months in. Again, awful dry mouth and headaches and now nausea and heart palpitations. Terrible nausea and headaches and had crippling nihilism and suicidal thoughts worse than when I wasn’t being treated. My anxiety came back full swing. I slowly stopped taking it. The withdrawal is almost as bad as the side effects. I’ve been off of it for a week now and the withdrawal sucks but I’m glad I quit.",abigail

About a week before her bday I had the worst panic attack I've had in 6 years. I had to pull over, dad had to come and rescue me and drive me home, for 30+ minutes I couldn't see straight, heart pounding, even had a stranger come and talk to me, he couldn't believe I was having an attack because to him I seemed totally fine. Come to find out he was a priest, he prayed for me. Well I met with my Dr fee days later, he said paxil probably stopped working and he put me on Lexapro 20mg.

I was having major depression, anxiety and panic attacks. After seeing a psychologist and therapist they decided to start me on 10mg of Lexapro. During the first month, I started having extreme dry mouth, but by month 2 that went away. I started seeing results after about a month or so. I was no longer having intrusive thoughts, my anxiety decreased substantially and was no longer having panic attacks. It also helped with depressive episodes. I was sooo nervous about starting a new medication, but honestly Lexapro saved my life. A year later, I am so much more stable and able to make clear decisions.

It also removed my ability to enjoy sex (anorgasmia). I'm grateful I took it when I did, because it numbed me to the loss of a beloved family member to a horrible form of cancer, but that was exactly the problem - I was numb all the time. I had no lows, but I also had no highs; my personality felt like a constant flat line. In the end , I wanted my personality back, so I stopped taking it. It also caused me to gain weight (5-10 lbs).

I’ve been on Zoloft, abilify, adderrall, remeron , propranolol ( for high blood pressure and anxiety) and clonazepam for many years, and they seemed to help.

25,Lexapro,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 2, 2021",34,"I have suffered from clinical depression and anxiety for many years now and always been terrified about trying medication to help it. I wasn’t sleeping due to my anxiety and my mood was always extremely low and had little motivation to do anything. I was always extremely tired because I would wake up constantly with racing thoughts but thought I may have a vitamin deficiency so used to take multivitamins that didn’t help. Since taking lexapro I feel 100% better, literally after the first few days I felt calmer and more able to sleep. There were side effects at first like sweating and inability to orgasm but these have thankfully subsided. Taking lexapro has really made me realise that people with depression and anxiety have chemical imbalances that sometimes medication can only solve. I’m not saying I am completely cured and still have my low days but this drug has helped me immensely with managing my anxiety and depression.",Ck2e16
26,Lexapro,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,,"December 28, 2020",40,"2 years ago I was majorly depressed and saw a psych who put me on fluoxetine and I also tried Effexor. Worst medications ever... every day I couldn’t eat from feeling nauseas and I would have the most violent graphic dreams that would leave me feeling exhausted when I woke. Both these medications also made me feel like a zombie, I seemed lifeless to everyone. I then tried lexapro which compared to the other two this medication is amazing. The first two weeks are really yucky and you need to be prepared for that. It doesn’t seem like it will get better at all, in the first few days I had very bad anxiety and couldn’t sleep. Just lay low at home until it passes, once it did I just feel like a brand new person. All the horrible thoughts are gone and I can function like a normal person and still feel human. One thing I found is taking this medication at night caused me to have bad dreams so I take it in the morning and the dreams at night don’t happen anymore. Hope this helps",Lm

It has done wonders helping my social anxiety which is basically nonexistent now. I still sometimes feel depressed, but nothing nearly as bad as when I was unmedicated.

30,Lexapro,Major Depressive Disorder,2.0,,"August 15, 2020",30,"26/f and I have been taking this medication Lexapro (started at 5 mg dose, now been at 20 mg) for several months for major depression and generalized anxiety. The main side-effects I’ve noticed: lack of ANY motivation, fatigued all day long (wanting to sleep 12+ hrs a day), mild dry mouth. I will say it’s taken my anxiety from about a 9-10 to about a 6 (on 20 mg). However, I’ve seen it do nothing for my depression. I’ve been crying almost daily, and there have been very dark thoughts I’ve experienced off and on. Honestly for myself, I’d rather deal with my anxiety w/out this med than deal with the severe fatigue. Also, if I forgot to take my medication one night on Lexapro, I felt like I was hit by a train the next day. No energy, would sleep 15+ hours, and feel incredibly low. Please follow your doctor’s orders and take medication on time. I will be asking my psychiatrist for a change of meds soon, because Lexapro isn’t it for me.",Chrissy94

It helps so much with my major anxiety and depression, the only reason I didn't give it a full 10 stars is because one time I stopped abruptly, and the side effects were pretty bad, but this isn’t something you should ever due because of physical and mental side effects and so it was my fault, not the drug, definitely talk to your doctor before stopping unlike I did!!",sarah

Between myself and my loved ones I think we’ve been through 7+ antidepressants. We made it through every single one and honestly reading reviews didn’t help in the slightest and harmed us more than anything. START LOW AND SLOW. I started this medication a year and a half ago, I had weened off fluvoxamine and had a period of about a week before starting Lexapro. For me Lexapro has been incredible. I’ve been on antidepressants for about 8 years and I've never been better despite my life circumstances honestly never being worst. Therapy has been a massive help but I honestly haven’t had a depressive episode since I started the medication and my anxiety has been a lot better.

Side effects included: late night panic attacks that woke me from my sleep (which I had never suffered from prior to starting this medication), chronic insomnia (that almost cost me my job), facial twitching, muscle spasms and involuntary movements of my neck, arms, legs and torso. Regarding the insomnia, I went from having 8 to 9 hours of restful sleep to 1-3 per night. I could not physically fall asleep even for a nap. If you are considering this medication or any antidepressant for short or long term use please do your research before taking them. Always work with a psychiatrist regarding mental health/prescriptions. Needless to say, that I have weaned off of this medication. I am still having some side effects after use.

I was social, got great grades, good moods all my teachers and friends noticed a huge difference in me. When I turned 19, I guess lexapro stopped working because I was having really intense suicidal thoughts and some suicide attempts. I was so high risk I had to get ECT. I've been hospitalized 11 times since I was 19. (I'm 23 now) most of the other ssris like zoloft, celexa, cymbalta, effexor, prozac were either ineffective or had terrible side effects. So I eventually went back on lexapro after therapy  ECT treatments, TMS, and ketamine infusions and it's been working for me again. I've been on it for 7 years in total and I'm not complaining.

The first day I was extremely tired and had a splitting headache all day. Today again super tired, and sad, and depressed still. I am praying this will go away after the first few weeks, but some say the tiredness never goes away on Lexapro.

He wanted to pair 5mg of lexapro with my Wellbutrin to see if it would stabilize things. I gave this med a whole thirty days cycle. I’m unsure if it was the pairing of the two or just the lexapro itself. But it caused me to physical and emotional distress. Physical: extreme nausea, diarrhea, upset stomach, dizziness, I had a ton of vivid dreams. I felt consistently even more fatigue, but could never fall asleep. Emotional side: I felt a bit foggy, had some really dark thoughts, more sensitive than usual, and had no motivation to workout, so activities I enjoy, etc. it intensified some of my old depression symptoms, instead of aiding it. I’m unsure if it helped the anxiety portion. This med is clearly not the right for me. Currently slowly weaning off of it. I hope it works better for others",mm

I'll guess between 8-10. The only one that I took longer than a few months was Zoloft and I don't even know why I continued to take it cause it didn't help with my major depression or anxiety. I think subconsciously I was just so desperate to feel ok. Anyone reading this that has hit the point of attempted suicide knows exactly what I mean. You don't have to be great and happy, you just want to be ok and feel like yourself. For years I've struggled and would think it couldn't get worse until it did. Over and over again. I've been on lexapro (generic) for only 2 days and for the first time in 6+ years I feel ok.

I've been taking lexepro for almost three months now, and I can hardly tell a difference. I don't really think of suicide anymore, but happy? Is anyone truly happy? Maybe it's just my situation at the moment that brings out my pessimistic side, but I don't feel much different at all.",SteveFrench
93,Lexapro,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 5, 2015",45,"I have suffered through depression most of my life (I am 16 now) and I have gone through many anti depressants but most left me feeling even more depressed (due to weight gain which is one of my triggers with depression). Lexapro is the only anti depressant I have been on that has not caused excessive crying, weight gain/loss, suicidial thoughts, etc. the only thing I noticed is I sleep a little more than normal but hey, sleep isn't bad for me.",Happily medicated
94,Lexapro,Major Depressive Disorder,6.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 28, 2015",16,"I've had depression since my teenage years but never spoke to anyone about it and didn't take anything for it until 2 and a half years ago when I had a bad run of luck with a few big things close together, it all got too much and I took a massive amount of prescription medication to try and end my life, 16 hours later I was woken up by my mum and taken to hospital. The Drs said most people wouldn't of woken up or at least had severe organ damage but I was ok, no damage. That's when I had to speak to Drs, psychs, family and some friends. They put me on lexapro and it worked fairly well for 2 years but when a few bad, stressful situations happened again it failed the test, I'm now trying venlafaxin, not sure yet but hopefully I get better results",the fish
95,Lexapro,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,,"March 26, 2015",40,"Lexapro was the first medication for what was first diagnosed as adjustment disorder and later major depressive disorder. Lexapro (escatalopram) had me relaxed within a couple of days. I was so chilled. Any more relaxed and you'd think I was asleep. I have a highly stressed involved workplace where I lead teams of people and I was able to get my patience, communicative persona, positive outlook and collaborative nature back on track. My home life improved immensely. I was able to regain my perspective on the importance of issues meaning I could let small things go. The most important thing is I felt better in myself. I was so happy until two years down the track. Unfortunately it stopped working.",Julza
96,Lexapro,Major Depressive Disorder,,,"March 22, 2015",55,"I have been borderline depressive my entire life, I am now discovering.  It finally came to a point in my life where I was spinning internally and out of control.  At a normal doctor checkup I began to cry and my doctor handed me tissues and waited.  When I was done, he calmly asked okay, tell me what's going on.  And I talked.  He prescribed 10mg of Lexapro (generic and I can't begin to spell or pronounce it) He told me it would take about a month before symptoms would disappear and peacefulness would return.  It didn't take a week and there has been such a change in me.  Everyone in my life (including my disagreeable boss!!) has noticed and things are just nicer all the way around.  Wish I'd been on this stuff decades ago.",Tornado Alley Cat
97,Lexapro,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 26, 2014",33,"I have been on Zoloft for 5 years and it was horrible for first 4 months!  Then it began to work.  But after 5 years and had recently upped to highest dose, it stopped working.  So after discussion with psychiatrist, decided to try Lexapro.  I was weaning slowly off the Zoloft and was doing good then boom!  Horrible brain zaps, unorganized thinking, it was terrible!  Psych told me to start with a quarter of  a 10mg tab, as I continued to wean of the Zoloft.  The very next day was great...no more brain zaps, mood stabilized because the side effects from weaning off Zoloft were gone!  I'm now on the full 10mg Lexapro and down to about 10mg of Zoloft.  Lexapro is great so far. I am well pleased.  I also take 1mg Klonipin twice daily.",cj rose

99,Lexapro,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,,"November 30, 2014",83,"After suffering with slight anxiety and what I now look back and recognize as mild depression for years my anxiety ""blew up"" one year ago. It manifested itself in severe panic attacks about diseases, life, intrusive thoughts, and thinking that I was going crazy. It got worse for 8 months until I figured I was going to die or find a med that worked. I tried 2 prior to Lexapro and they were awful. I had no quality of life and honestly thought I'd be dead by now. Lexapro SAVED my life. It kicked in in about 5 weeks and I had some rough patches for a few more. At week 8 I was me again. At times I still have severe anxiety with intrusive thoughts but they are easy to push away. I have a life again!",KH411
100,Lexapro,Major Depressive Disorder,,,"November 9, 2014",51,"I was a very emotional teenager and couldn't handle small problems. After trauma around the age of 17 I was diagnosed major depressive disorder, anxiety, mood swings and a personality disorder. I started taking escitalopram 10 and of course the first weeks were still as bad as before or even worse but for me it felt like I was already in hell. After a month I felt great! Just as clear head, stable, no running thoughts or emotions and just happy and peaceful. After one and a half year I quit drop by drop in a time lapse of 3 months but I had to start again because all the symptoms came back. It is really hard to just start taking again or to admit you need it. All side effects are in my opinion way nicer than uncontrollable emotions.",Emster
101,Lexapro,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,,"October 28, 2014",43,"Rating - 10 -11Very good and very effective. Taking Lexapro since 2009.  Few problems. Have a very serious depression/minor schizo-psychosis problem. Took generic and am taking Lexapro again. Had a few problems with generic.    Don't have same calm reaction with generic. Lexapro puts me in a good mood most of the time.  Feeling of equilibrium mentally.  Am happier/relaxed/calmer. Does make me very sleepy/drowsy, & a few other minor side effects. Only antidepressant I have had few problems with.  Able to be more relaxed. Can fall asleep in a matter of minutes instead of hours. Have had a very good experience with it.

After my separation, my life fell apart and I couldn't control my emotions. I was dealing with depression, anxiety and rage. I am very anti medication but knew I needed help. I completely broke down and sought help. I was prescribed Zoloft for the first time in my life and felt that I went crazy. My anxiety kicked in overtime and I lost my job. I will never be able to explain how bad it was but I tried to just survive for another year thinking nothing would help. Three months ago I went back to my doctor's office and was prescribed 20mg of Lexapro. I told her I was terrified but would try anything at this point. It took two months to feel like a human again. It saved me.",Antimeds
