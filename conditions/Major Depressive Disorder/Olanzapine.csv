0,Olanzapine,Major Depressive Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 4, 2022",0,"Typical antipsychotic,  makes you sleep, gain weight, and suffer from sexual side effects.  Disconnects you from all emotions and you walk around like a zombie.  This one though, has the added effect of DOUBLE the weight gain.  My girlfriend gained 45 pounds in 4 months on this.  All Atypicals should just be gone as far as I'm concerned.  They should only be used for people with serious psychosis, delusions and hallucinations.  Doctors are giving them to everyone because they know SSRIs fail more than half the time and they will do anything to avoid giving a benzo because they care only about their license and stopped caring about the patients.Signed and attested by me, a psychiatrist myself that specializes in mood disorder and addiction.  Plot twist.  We don't like  giving it as much as you don't like taking it!",Zandieh

I weighed 154 and have never had a weight problem. Within about 6-8 months I gained 60 pounds!  It increases your appetite but also slows your metabolism by a lot. At the higher doses I had stomach issues like diarrhea daily. I had bad nausea 90% of every day and lived on ginger. We’ve been lowering it now very slowly for a few months and I completely stopped it 2 weeks ago. The side effects are terrible. I’ve missed so much work as I’ve had horrible migraines, weakness, shakiness, etc…. This is a horrible medication!!!",Beth

3,Olanzapine,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 4, 2021",5,"I’ve suffered from severe depression and anxiety for such a long time. I am only 22 years old but I have tried several antidepressants already.  I was put on Escitalopram 20 mg but it seemed it wasn’t doing enough for my condition. My doc suggested me to take 2.5 mg of Olanzapine alongside with my antidepressant. I felt a relief from the first days. It was pretty unbelievable for me. My obsessive thoughts were not so violent and frequent anymore, I could laugh, make jokes, be present, do sports, cook etc. I felt the desire to go out and do things, which was a pretty big step for me. I am so thankful for this drug. I really hope it will get even better and better.",Nico04

I work as a senior java developer in charge of my own projects, and using olanzapine has led me to stutter and forget words during meetings, unable to keep conversations or explain my recommendations to my clients.- Sleeping 12-14 hours a day. While I did have a normal night's sleep, i wasn't able to keep up an activity for more than 30 mins.- Minor movement issues. I sometimes had lip tremors, especially while having facial expressions.",stefatorus

It caused my dad to get diabetes, and I took it not knowing that it was the same medication and gave me a terrible reaction. I had to be rushed to the hospital. I couldn’t walk because I was so out of it. I started talking funny, I couldn’t focus, much less keep myself awake most of the time. This medicine is for schizophrenia patients NOT bipolar.

11,Olanzapine,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,,"May 17, 2020",43,"This olanzapine is the worst drug ever made. Makes you lose all your emotion and decreases your IQ. Increases anxiety and depression and increases restlessness that does not go away after going off the drug. Completely messes up your GI system  with terrible constipation, zero energy, inability to cry, decreases communication and you lose the ability to have any type of sex life. Big pharma should be ashamed to have this available. I would give it a zero if I could.",Doc

It worked, I felt less suicidal because I felt more dull. Zyprexa is a medication meant for short time use and many people end up on it for years and years. It acts a sexual suppressant though, which I didn’t notice until I was off of it and suddenly felt more easily turned on. It is very hard to get off it and has some side effects; it took me 1 yr to taper it down and when I finally got off of it I am now having terrible issues sleeping.",Reallytiredtbh

My medication is the following;80mg methadone daily. (mornings)15mg Mirtazapine before bed.5mg wafer Zyprexa mid-afternoon.Only since adding Zyprexa have all my worries and depression been absolved. Incredible medication. In a wafer lollie.If you are opioid dependant like me, suboxone or methadone and you still feel a bit off. SSRIs are not working. Talk to your doctor about Zyprexa wafers. People worry about weight gain on Zyprexa. But a calorie is a calorie. FASTING you'll be Okay. Food cravings have not really increased. Fast Fast in the mornings and you will be fine. Balanced diet after lunchtime and youll be fine.",Anonymous
22,Olanzapine,Major Depressive Disorder,2.0,,"February 17, 2018",14,"To say olanzapine is either good or bad is too simplistic.  When times were rough (and they were very rough indeed!) this drug did help me to carry on living.  However, as I recovered, at some stage I felt the awful side-effects were not worth continuing it.  Incredible weight gain (6 stone in total) was just one of them.  It also dumbed me down a lot, I wasn't as alert anymore, had problems concentrating - but I slept like a log.  Came off this drug completely about 2 months ago and I feel a lot better for it! Feels like I'm me again.  People have commented on how I smile and laugh a lot more.  I have much more energy and don't need a nap in the afternoon anymore.  Overall, I feel this drug can be helpful in the short term, but, at least for me, it's not a long-term option!",satyam2016

I was taking 2.5mg in the morning and 2.5 at night but successfully decreased by half for day and night.CBT has helped as well. I am not a doctor but if your debating on if you should take it I would. The weight gain is a side effect but I have managed by limiting to 3 meals a day and not having any sweets in the house. Take note I am also on Cipralex and Lamotrigine so the cocktail of meds is helping alot,Happy Dude

I recently fell into a deep depression, was suicidal, and began cutting myself. I was admitted to a psych ward for 4 days, and was prescribed 5mg olanzepine, and my fluoxetine was reduced to 10mg from 30. I'm doing SO much better with this combination. I'm not as anxious as I used to be. My depression is about gone completely, and I'm more patient with society. I've been on it for 2 weeks. The only down side is that I am STARVING, ALL THE TIME. No food can satisfy my stomach. I'm 6' and 150lb, so I don't care if I gain weight, but my mom has type II diabetes, so I'm paranoid taking this medication, which doesn't help my situation",Delta99

The last 5 years of excruciating fear, shaking, crying, not showering/dressing. Staring at television all day, taking sleeping pills to keep me out of the world and avoid suicide.

I went from being a healthy 170 lbs (women's size 12) to a lethargic 250 lbs (size 20). All I wanted to do on this medicine was eat. Another side effect was that I was tired all the time. I would sleep for 14 hours and still be tired.This medication also raised my blood sugar and my general practitioner was ready to put me on medication for type 2 diabetes. I'm only 25 and just want to be healthy again. So glad I got off this medication. Been off it for 5 days (now on Viibryd) and already feel a million percent better!",beedoose

36,Olanzapine,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,,"May 19, 2015",14,"I have been taking this in combination with Citalopram 40mg for about 7 years. This drug controlled my racing thoughts and allowed me to sleep properly. My initial dose was 7.5mg but I am now down to 2.5mg. For me now it feels that 7.5mg was a very strong dose but I needed it at the time. I had no negative side effects. No withdrawal on reducing dosage. I don't suffer undue hunger - actually for me my depression contributed to a lack of appetite so any effect was actually beneficial to me.

It's a miracle to me.However, I gained 20 pounds in one month, and the doctor saw that as a reason to get me off the drug.
