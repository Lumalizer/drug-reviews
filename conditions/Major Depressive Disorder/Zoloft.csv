1,Zoloft,Major Depressive Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 9, 2022",2,"First I wanted to say that I was prescribed it for depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, and social anxiety. I started it 4 months ago and I’m currently on 125mg but just recently changed it back to 100mg. I realized that it was I felt happier and almost manic for the first month. The second month I was on 50mg and it was ok, however I will say that the negative side effects started at 100mg. I have ZERO love for my boyfriend currently and I feel like my libido has decreased. It’s really hard to climax even by myself. All my romantic feelings for my bf are basically gone. However, I am sexual still, as in my thoughts, I am still a sexual person, but I just don’t feel it when it’s actually happening if that makes sense. I know this because I have a huge crush on my bf’s brother which is not good but that means I’m still capable of feeling love and emotions but they’re less intense for sure. Also insomnia is pretty bad. It def works. Almost too well.",Jujubeeee

3,Zoloft,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 5, 2022",6,"Hi! I've been taking Zoloft for Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety for going on 5 months now. The first two weeks taking it, were genuinely the worst two weeks of my life-- all I could do was sit in bed all day, every day, and even that was too much for me. I completely lost my appetite, lost 15 lbs in two weeks. I constantly had diarrhea, an increased heart rate, anxiety 100% of the time. Week 3 came around, and I felt a shift start; things started to get better, slowly. By week five, I was able to do things I hadn't been able to do in years! I've had pretty bad anxiety surrounding making phone calls my entire life, and now I don't! Not every day is totally great, no pill can guarantee that-- but my life feels liveable again. I promised myself that if Zoloft worked for me, I'd come back to this website and write a review. During those first two weeks, I used to scroll through this website for HOURS, and reading positive reviews is what got me through it.",Tabitha
4,Zoloft,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 5, 2021",27,"This was me at the start of my Zoloft journey desperately reading reviews. I promised myself that if this medication worked then I would come back and leave a review. I was struggling with major depression where I didn't leave the house, stopped socializing, and leading a normal life. Zoloft gave me my  life back. Most importantly I do want to mention that you have to wait a good 3-4 weeks to see significant results so please do not give up early. If Zoloft can bring me back from the depths of depression it can definitely help you. I also struggled with anxiety and panic attacks and this medication works amazingly for that too. If your reading this and feel like you can't lead a normal life because your depression is stopping you... I'm begging you to please give it a try. You deserve to be happy in the end :)",depressedchick
5,Zoloft,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 30, 2021",8,"If you’re looking to change your life and become the person you want and used to be, this drug helps. It all started one day while driving. I had a panic attack so badly I passed out at the wheel. I thought I was dying. I continued to have terrible panic attacks so badly I had to stop working, I secluded myself at home and didn’t interact with anyone. This went on for years!!!! I finally reached out to my doctor after trying everything organic and she started me on 25mg of Zoloft. I was diagnosed with OCD, MDD, Anxiety and PTSD. Within a few weeks I felt a weight lift off of me. My dosage slowly increased to 100mg. It saved me. It saved my marriage. I had my first child. My life is now mine again and I can handle what comes my way. You also have to get outside, workout, eat clean. But this helps give you the drive and energy to change your life.",The best me
6,Zoloft,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 29, 2021",5,"For months, I was struggling with anxiety and then I had a depressive episode, where I had sudicial thoughts. I knew there was something that I should do about this, so I booked an appointment with a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with Depression, GAD and SAD. While first taking Zoloft (50mg), I didn't notice any immediate changes, I was still struggling to get to school and with my racing thoughts, that would leave me in bed all day. However, as days went on I noticed I wasn't overthinking as much, my brain just felt much quieter and I noticed myself getting an interest back into things. My family even commented that I seemed much like myself once again, laughing and smiling etc. I've now been on Zoloft for about 2 months now and I only occasionally feel anxious (which is an improvement from every single day) I'm able to go to work as normal, study (and concentrate!), gym — overall, my quality of life has improved! (my sleep has also improved) Zoloft is life changing.",Ruby
7,Zoloft,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 23, 2021",2,"I have been taking Zoloft for a few months now and I can honestly say this has helped me. I was so depressed I could barely take care of my toddler and I had so much anxiety I didn't like leaving my house. Since taking this I do not have panic attacks anymore and I do not feel as depressed all the time. Now my depression comes in waves and does not last for long, whereas before, I would feel depressed for days at a time. I will say the side effects are annoying. I experienced nausea, nightmares, decreased appetite, followed by increased appetite, extreme fatigue and jaw pain (weird I know). After taking this for a few months most of the side effects have subsided. I do still have VERY vivid dreams which I have never had before, but it's not a big deal to me as long as they are not nightmares.As far as dosing, I started off with 50mg after two weeks increased to 100mg and have just recently been told to up it to 150mg to help with lingering anxiety.",Helps a lot
8,Zoloft,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 14, 2021",4,"I’ve had intense anxiety & depression for 3 years. I put off ever taking meds because  I was scared of the side effects. Then I hit rock bottom & realised I couldn’t live another day how I was. Long story short, I began Zoloft. The first week was dark. Physically, emotionally, mentally & spiritually dark. Then, on day 11, I woke up completely content. I talked to my family, laughed, hugged. Each day seemed to get 10% better than the day before. It was overwhelmingly good. My thoughts were clear. When anxious & dark thoughts or even days arise, which they inevitably do, I am able to move on. They don’t spiral & debilitate me. 3 weeks on & I am calm. Content. Happy. I socialise?!?! I feel like me again. I look back on the last 3 years & I truly didn’t realise how anxious & sad I was. It controlled my every move. Now, I feel as though I am the one in control of my life. I am so, so deeply grateful for this.",Cass

10,Zoloft,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,,"August 26, 2021",38,"Zoloft saved my life. During my pregnancy, I started experiencing  severe anxiety and depression. I was throwing up every single day, missing work, withdrawing from life. I had panic attacks from the time I woke up until the time I went to bed. I dreaded and feared waking up every day and having to just be alive again. I felt hopeless, miserable, worthless. It got to the point where I genuinely had urges to hurt myself and thought it would be better if I just died. Cue Zoloft. I started on 50 mg, and within about two weeks noticed small improvements in my energy, but still felt extremely low and incapable. I spent HOURS on this forum looking for the motivation to keep pushing. Things gradually improved over the weeks, and after about 6 weeks on Zoloft, I woke up one morning and just realized...I felt like me again. I wasn't hopeless. I wasn't depressed. I was able to laugh again. I actually saw my future again. If you're in the same place I was, KEEP GOING! Things will get better!",Jc129864
11,Zoloft,Major Depressive Disorder,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 2, 2021",4,"Psychiatrist prescribed me Zoloft for major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and borderline personality disorder. Day 1 - 17 = 50mg. Day 18 - present = 75mg. I noticed a difference in about 2 days of being on it. Only felt mild nausea for the first 3 days. The most prevalent side effect whilst taking 50mg was fatigue that would begin 45 mins after ingestion in the morning. I have been on 75mg for 2 days now and I don't have the fatigue feeling. Zoloft keeps me at a baseline of 'okay'. It's early days and a small dose but I can still feel quite depressed and angry etc but there is a higher chance of it not being a poisonous cloud over me at all times compared to when I wasn't medicated. I will say that intense mania/dissociation is a symptom I didn't expect to experience (although it was brought on by a complex post traumatic stress disorder trigger.) Zoloft seems to help with my digestive system regularity. Will continue to stay on it. Would recommend.",1995

I will never forget the day I felt the change and it was like night and day! Rumination, social anxiety, obsessive thoughts, depressive symptoms have all lightened since starting zoloft, thankfully. Better quality of life overall. Do not discontinue abruptly - that will be dangerous! Side effects for me are decreased libido, weight gain.

18,Zoloft,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,,"January 6, 2021",13,"I was prescribed Zoloft and Klonopin twice in the past both for depression and anxiety-related issues. The first time it took about 5 months to recover, 3 the second time. I stayed on Zoloft first time 7 months, second time 12 months.During Covid, after being 3 years free of antidepressants and depression, I found myself falling back. This time the main concern was insomnia. Zoloft and Klonopin helped me to restore healthy sleeping patterns. It took a few months. I also went on a low sugar diet, worked out, went to therapy, meditated, did breathing exercises, found support, followed CBTI. Today I am depression-free. I generally sleep fine. I am on 75mg! I am off of benzos as Zoloft took full effect in month 4.If you have been on any medication for more than 8 weeks and do not feel better or feel worse, talk to your prescriber. Again, Zoloft can be helpful to someone at 25 mg to others at 150mg. You have to play around and give it time.",pineapple1986

I felt so relieved--- For the first month or so, I was emotionally flat, but that improved with time and I no longer have that symptom. I was started out on 50mg and now moved up to 150mg.There's no cure to depression/anxiety, and I still have episodes, but nothing compares to how I used to feel.

25,Zoloft,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 26, 2020",39,I began taking sertraline 2 months ago for depression and social anxiety and I’ve enjoyed its effects so far. The first couple of days on it I had digestive issues and I would say the main side effect I have now is hunger and dry mouth along with really vivid and strange dreams. I started out at 50mg and it definitely helped with my depression but I knew the dosage needed to be upped and I just recently started taking 100mg and it’s working really well I feel like I’m finally able to do something with myself and I’m finally able to focus and have a clear mind for once.

26,Zoloft,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2020",48,"I first tried Lexapro for major depression that came out of nowhere and rendered me useless for 6 weeks. The Lexapro was awful and gave me massive panic attacks and unable to get out of bed because I felt so ill. I then switched to Zoloft and it has saved my life. Within two weeks my mood has lifted significantly and I feel so relieved of my terrible depression. I started very slowly as I was worried about having the same response as with the Lexapro. I would recommend anyone do it this way if you want to ease in with minimal side effects. I started with 12.5mg for three days, then 25mg for another 3, then 37.5mg and now 50mg. Side effects were minimal but it did make me drowsy for awhile. My anxiety and crying increased slightly at the start and then gradually I found myself singing a little tune or being more lighthearted with my kids.

Zoloft gave me the energy, the clarity, and the motivation to continue my life. Last May, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals completely CHANGED the molecular formula, pertaining solely to the 50 mg tablets. I knew something was awry the second I opened the new bottle and viewed the COLOR. My lifesaving pale blue medication of over 30 years was now a Bright Aqua Blue. Of course the Pharmacist informed me it was the same medication. Of course I already knew it wouldn't be.   Never have I been so sick. I have ultimately returned to the weak pathetic hopeless person of 30 years ago. I lost everything including my teaching job. This new Zoloft has me out of my mind.  I'm ready to commit myself.

28,Zoloft,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2020",13,"I suffer from major depression, GAD, and ADHD and was given Zoloft for my worsening depression and anxiety on top of Wellbutrin and lamotrigine. I began experiencing a lot of gas and digestive issues but that was a minor thing. Never before have I reacted so negatively to a medication. I was already depressed, but usually it was more up and down. This just made me feel very dissociated and completely dead inside. I have cut very occasionally and impulsively, but on this I was compulsively injuring myself with anything I could for hours just to feel something. Was extremely traumatic. I didn’t react well to Prozac when I took it years ago either. I’m going to stay away from SSRI’s. Please be careful! Antidepressants can be amazing and I don’t mean to discourage anyone from getting help. My experience isn’t everyone’s, but nonetheless, they should definitely be taken seriously.

Before I started taking zoloft I was having constant suicidal thoughts and urges, I was starving myself, self harming, and would have horrible breakdowns almost daily where I would cry for hours at a time. Zoloft didn’t cure my depression completely, but it greatly reduced my most severe symptoms. After a few weeks I realized that the constant inner dialogue telling me to kill myself had stopped, I had no more self harm urges, and I wasn’t having breakdowns every day. On Zoloft I feel like I can experience a normal healthy range of emotions. I still get sad but not to the point where I want to kill or injure myself.

Before Zoloft I was on Wellbutrin for about a year. Switched after ending up in the hospital. Both made me feel numb, which I guess is better than crying and crushing sadness all the time? Lol. Zoloft, unlike wellbutrin, has killed my sex drive. I think it helped with my depression, but it’s hard to say. I started taking it after leaving a horribly abusive relationship, so I can’t say for sure if it was the Zoloft that made me feel better.

This is my second time on zoloft - I was on it about 5 years ago and had my depression well-controlled until a recent job loss and move triggered another incident. I dealt with horrible side effects for over three weeks - feeling trapped in bed in the morning with anxiety, incredible nausea, brain fog, the works. I’m only on 25mg (when I was on it before I started on 50 but switched to 25 as 50 made me very sleepy), but the side effects were still a lot to deal with. I’m happy to report that I’ve started to feel normal again this week, and that aside from a bit of morning anxiety, the side effects are gone. While there is no guarantee this drug will work for you, if you are experiencing uncertainty because you are in the throes of med adjustment, there may be relief on the other end.

I started on the lowest dosage of Zoloft (25mg), but had to incrementally increase the dosage over the course of six months to get the dosage quite right.I’ve now been on Zoloft (150mg daily) for over two years and it works really well for major depressive disorder, I finally feel normal, even though I really didn’t know what normal felt like before. I no longer think of suicide every day, and I am better able to manage tough days and tough emotions.I had relatively few side effects.

I had severe hair loss, I was never hungry- I lost 15 pounds taking this. I was sweaty all the time despite being calm instead of anxious. Could not tolerate any alcohol. Had a lot of headaches. Ground my teeth at night. Could not orgasm EVER. Was also in therapy the entire time I took this- with the goal of getting off of it once I was able to deal with things on my own from therapy. Took a 3 month taper and lots of benadryl to help me sleep but I got off it and haven't taken any meds in 5 years. You have to weigh the pros and cons.

110,Zoloft,Major Depressive Disorder,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 3, 2015",19,"Has helped enough that I still take it. A word of warning though, you may experience incontinence soon after (that lovely 'd' word). In my case, it only takes about 5 minutes before nature comes calling (!)Up until recently, I attributed it to the coffee I have every morning with my breakfast, as caffeine is apparently a common cause. Then I spoke to a friend who'd stopped taking Zoloft because of this side effect and it suddenly dawned on me. So I tested it. Had my usual breakfast & coffee, this time without the meds. 1/2 hour went by, no complaints down below. Took the Zoloft and sure enough, 4 or 5 minutes later, off to the the toilet again.It's not a huge problem for me since it's predictable, only happens in the morning, and the drug does help depression-wise but some people may not feel the same way (no pun intended). Interestingly, I take the same dose again in the evening with no side-effect, so I suspect the morning combination with coffee may play a part.",Stuart_D
