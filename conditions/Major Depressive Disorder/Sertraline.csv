I didn't notice any immediate side effects, good or bad. In 4/5 weeks as I got up in dose to about 100mg I started to notice I was getting less intrusive thoughts. It wasn't a fast fix but I've now been on it for 4 months. I get little to no side effects. I take it at night to avoid drowsiness but that's the only down side.  I can handle my depressive episodes now and life feels easier.",Kitkat
2,Sertraline,Major Depressive Disorder,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 9, 2022",2,"Zoloft (sertraline):First I wanted to say that I was prescribed it for depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, and social anxiety. I started it 4 months ago and I’m currently on 125mg but just recently changed it back to 100mg. I realized that it was I felt happier and almost manic for the first month. The second month I was on 50mg and it was ok, however I will say that the negative side effects started at 100mg. I have ZERO love for my boyfriend currently and I feel like my libido has decreased. It’s really hard to climax even by myself. All my romantic feelings for my bf are basically gone. However, I am sexual still, as in my thoughts, I am still a sexual person, but I just don’t feel it when it’s actually happening if that makes sense. I know this because I have a huge crush on my bf’s brother which is not good but that means I’m still capable of feeling love and emotions but they’re less intense for sure. Also insomnia is pretty bad. It def works. Almost too well.",Jujubeeee
3,Sertraline,Major Depressive Disorder,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 3, 2022",0,"I have ADHD, depression (dysthymia and MDD), and some anxious tendencies. I took Zoloft 75mg for 9 months. I am not sure if it ever really helped me, but by the end I had emotional blunting and severe sexual dysfunction, as well as severe depression with suicidal ideation. I was also still anxious. I've tapered off them without any problems, and now (a week after my last 25mg dose) I feel less depressed. Clearly this isn't causation, but I do strongly feel the sertraline was making me worse overall, especially my ADHD. I think plenty of people have had good experiences with it, but unfortunately I did not.",ianmacaig

It causes me extreme insomnia, not being able to fall or stay asleep. It also causes nausea that has been consistent no matter what dose I take. And of course the libido side effects. My mood has not changed. I have noticed no withdrawal symptoms, and have abruptly discontinued this medication twice.

Each time, it has and I ask pharmacist to change back or try another.   This has happened at least 4 or 5 times.  If the tablet looks different to you it probably is.

I've been taking Zoloft for Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety for going on 5 months now. The first two weeks taking it, were genuinely the worst two weeks of my life-- all I could do was sit in bed all day, every day, and even that was too much for me. I completely lost my appetite, lost 15 lbs in two weeks. I constantly had diarrhea, an increased heart rate, anxiety 100% of the time. Week 3 came around, and I felt a shift start; things started to get better, slowly. By week five, I was able to do things I hadn't been able to do in years! I've had pretty bad anxiety surrounding making phone calls my entire life, and now I don't! Not every day is totally great, no pill can guarantee that-- but my life feels liveable again. I promised myself that if Zoloft worked for me, I'd come back to this website and write a review. During those first two weeks, I used to scroll through this website for HOURS, and reading positive reviews is what got me through it.",Tabitha

I promised myself that if this medication worked then I would come back and leave a review. I was struggling with major depression where I didn't leave the house, stopped socializing, and leading a normal life. Zoloft gave me my  life back. Most importantly I do want to mention that you have to wait a good 3-4 weeks to see significant results so please do not give up early. If Zoloft can bring me back from the depths of depression it can definitely help you. I also struggled with anxiety and panic attacks and this medication works amazingly for that too. If your reading this and feel like you can't lead a normal life because your depression is stopping you... I'm begging you to please give it a try.

The first month or two was fine, I felt a lot better in my day to day life. It was easier to go through the day without crying or having severe anxiety about everything going on. After the two month mark, I started to realize I had no concept of time or memory. I began to have intrusive violent and suicidal thoughts that I hadn’t experienced before. This started to freak me out so I went to my PCP to get off of it. I weaned off of zoloft over the recommended 2 week period. I had a week long manic episode that had never occurred before.

I had bad anxiety and mood swings and was first put on Lexapro.  It helped calm my anxious thoughts and stable my mood and I stayed on it for about 6 months until it seemed to be kind of dull.  I then went onto Wellbutrin which completely destroyed me, had the worst depression and anxiety and told my doctor I needed to get off it ASAP.  I looked up a bunch of SSRIs and found Zoloft and decided to give it a go.  So far, I really love it.  It's given me my life back, I have energy again and feel better about myself in general.

Since taking this I do not have panic attacks anymore and I do not feel as depressed all the time. Now my depression comes in waves and does not last for long, whereas before, I would feel depressed for days at a time. I will say the side effects are annoying. I experienced nausea, nightmares, decreased appetite, followed by increased appetite, extreme fatigue and jaw pain (weird I know). After taking this for a few months most of the side effects have subsided. I do still have VERY vivid dreams which I have never had before, but it's not a big deal to me as long as they are not nightmares.As far as dosing, I started off with 50mg after two weeks increased to 100mg and have just recently been told to up it to 150mg to help with lingering anxiety.",Helps a lot

I struggled with the side effects, especially nausea and increased anxiety. No body is the same, your body will be unique to adjusting to this medication. But it WORKS. Trust the process. I remember reading reviews like this sick to the stomach and praying it was worth it. My side effect symptoms lasted longer than most (about 9 weeks) the average is much shorter, so don’t let that scare you! I went from not being able to get out of bed and completely hopeless, panic attacks, etc. To waking up and enjoying a new day and thankful for each bit of life I have. If I’m brutally honest I was in such a dark place…this medicine brought me out and back to the me I recognize. Do NOT let anyone shame you for taking medication. Some brains are wired differently and that’s what it is for. You’re not less than them. Stay on the path and keep hope.

I put off ever taking meds because  I was scared of the side effects. Then I hit rock bottom & realised I couldn’t live another day how I was. Long story short, I began Zoloft. The first week was dark. Physically, emotionally, mentally & spiritually dark. Then, on day 11, I woke up completely content. I talked to my family, laughed, hugged. Each day seemed to get 10% better than the day before. It was overwhelmingly good. My thoughts were clear. When anxious & dark thoughts or even days arise, which they inevitably do, I am able to move on. They don’t spiral & debilitate me. 3 weeks on & I am calm. Content. Happy. I socialise?!?! I feel like me again. I look back on the last 3 years & I truly didn’t realise how anxious & sad I was. It controlled my every move. Now, I feel as though I am the one in control of my life.

I was throwing up every single day, missing work, withdrawing from life. I had panic attacks from the time I woke up until the time I went to bed. I dreaded and feared waking up every day and having to just be alive again. I felt hopeless, miserable, worthless. It got to the point where I genuinely had urges to hurt myself and thought it would be better if I just died. Cue Zoloft. I started on 50 mg, and within about two weeks noticed small improvements in my energy, but still felt extremely low and incapable. I spent HOURS on this forum looking for the motivation to keep pushing. Things gradually improved over the weeks, and after about 6 weeks on Zoloft, I woke up one morning and just realized...I felt like me again. I wasn't hopeless. I wasn't depressed.

Before, I only had moments of happiness when eating. I binged on food every day and gained over 100lbs because it was literally the only thing that made me feel any type of emotion other than anger and doom. Now, just 60 days later, I don’t even think about food that much because I don’t need that mood boost I would get from eating.

The most prevalent side effect whilst taking 50mg was fatigue that would begin 45 mins after ingestion in the morning. I have been on 75mg for 2 days now and I don't have the fatigue feeling. Zoloft keeps me at a baseline of 'okay'. It's early days and a small dose but I can still feel quite depressed and angry etc but there is a higher chance of it not being a poisonous cloud over me at all times compared to when I wasn't medicated. I will say that intense mania/dissociation is a symptom I didn't expect to experience (although it was brought on by a complex post traumatic stress disorder trigger.)

Over the last year at work, I noticed that I had begun to have more regular emotional meltdowns and panic attacks. It was at that point that I decided I had to find a solution. I had already gone through counselling with various people and decided to try medication. Started at a low dose of 50mg per day. At the very beginning it made me a bit tired and nauseous, but it's been a while and I'm at 100mg. I think the 50 was pretty good, but at 100 I feel like I'm living on autopilot and am emotionless toward many things. I'm going back to 50mg and think I'll only go up to 100mg when I really need it.

177,Sertraline,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,,"March 19, 2015",36,"Zoloft (sertraline):Although I have only been on this med for 12 days so far. I feel wonderful. I have had severe depression due to being sick the past 3 years and nothing has been helping me get better (spinal nerve damage and severe migraines everyday) ; sometimes I just felt like I wanted to die I felt no hope.I haven't felt any side effects and my migraines are almost completely gone. I get up and do more around my house, more than ever and I am taking better care of myself. Im happy for the first time in my life. I know most people will think it's too good to be true; but really you should ask your doctor if it might be for you. I am so glad I am on this; never had a medicine work so good. Hope it last. Plus right now I have the flu and still happy!",KBSteph
178,Sertraline,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,,"December 28, 2014",8,"This medicine has been a GOD SEND for me! Bad nerves (anxiety, panic attacks, etc.) & depression run rampant on my mom's side of the family & I've suffered since I was about 14 (I'm 41 now)! It was pure, unrelenting HELL suffering through that stuff at such a young age. Before Sertraline, I had tried Imipramine & then Paxil. The Sertraline has been the best (& worked the longest) by far but, I can almost guarantee it'll take away any libido you have. Your sex drive never seems to come back either, no matter how long you've been on this medicine. I thought it would but, nope! It HAS made me feel 'normal' (fine/healthy) again though & for that, I'm beyond grateful. Only side effects I had at first were weird dreams & smell/taste perversion.",Astrocat

I have been prescribed an SSRI multiple times but never took one because I was convinced my feelings of guilt and anxiety were appropriate reactions to my failures in life. I have lived a bohemian life chasing contentment and self respect. In a new relationship and questioned by my partner about my inconsolable sense of unhappiness, I realized I needed to try something other than running away so in a last ditch move, signed up for a depression study that has given me 6 mos of Zoloft medication. I have clarity now I haven't experienced in a decade, it is wonderful and sobering because I realize now how serious chemical depression is. Don't self medicate, it's OK to get help!",LMGale
181,Sertraline,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 25, 2014",25,"Zoloft (sertraline):Zoloft is a very good medication for anxiety and depression.  For me better with anxiety.  I am BiPolar I, am also on Zyban 150 a day. Taking these two medications together is fine as is also taking when you are BiPolar.  Only with a specialists direction, though.  I have been on Zoloft a couple of times the only side effect before was severe diarrhea.  This time when I started taking it I got butterflies in the stomach and flutters, but over time this unusual for me side effect left me.    Some say how many weeks to feel a impact. For me this last time was around 6 weeks. Which is normal. It's been proven that any time prior 4 weeks is most likely placebo effect.  But if you feel better well, whether a placebo effect or not, it's good.",Koalamaiden - NSW

I'd been on 3 other medications before that and none of them have worked as well as Zoloft when it's coupled with 15mg of Buspar and 20mg of Adderall. My anxiety has dropped, my mood has improved dramatically, and I've even lost weight, which I haven't been able to do since I recovered from my eating disorder. Unfortunately I think I'm going to have to have my dosage upped because of my Seasonal Affective Disorder, but otherwise it's worked very well.",Anonymous
183,Sertraline,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 2, 2014",101,"Zoloft (sertraline):I had major depression from the time I started menstruating.  It would cycle with my cycle.  It caused paranoia, and fear of being seen outside my home.  It feared going to my mail box, yet, at times I would sign up to do things like be an Avon Lady! I felt crazy. In my mid 30's, divorced, alcoholic, my doctor prescribed Prozac.  It didn't seem to help me.  Later in recovery but still profoundly depressed, she put me on Zoloft and the result was instantaneous.  I felt like a window to my life had been opened.  I wasn't afraid.  I looked forward to getting out of bed.  I found things I liked to do. I have a healthy relationship, a good job, a life.  I have been given my life back.  Now, I am 16 years sober.

185,Sertraline,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 9, 2014",126,"Zoloft (sertraline):I was chronically depressed and had many psychiatrists diagnose me with severe depression, which I had experienced unfaillingly for 5 years. I could identify no cause for my depression, which made it even harder for me since I didn't know what was causing me to become extremely suicidal. I had 4-hour lasting sobbing spells (even when I had otherwise great events happening at that time). I felt gloomy, lonesome, uncared for, and depressed. Now I feel content and at ease for the first time in 5 years. I no longer become sad unless I have a reason to- which for me is phenomenal. If good things happen, I feel happy and not sad. I can function better in my work, family life, and simple daily activities like driving or even grocery shopping.",SoAmazing!

I had suicidal thoughts and thoughts of just letting go.I went to the doctor for help and he prescribed me Zoloft 25mg but the 25mg wasn't working. So I took 50mg and it is awesome. I feel myself again like I was 18. No worries in the world. Just felling like life was life again. Thanks to Zoloft I got my life back.,LovingMyTwins
188,Sertraline,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,,"May 29, 2014",66,"Zoloft (sertraline):For me, this medication did not work on a lower dose of 50 mg, 100 mg, or even 150 mg. My depression got better once I was increased to 200 mg, which is the therapeutic limit, but this may be because my depression was incredibly severe -extremely suicidal, and not functioning at all. However, after taking this medication for a little over a year, I have come to the realization that it no longer is working for me, and I am experiencing what my psychiatrist calls a ""poop out,"" which is apparently something most SSRIs can do. I would recommend Zoloft (Sertraline) to anyone who has depression. It has honestly been the best medication for me, but for now, I need to try something new.",legakris
189,Sertraline,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,,"May 15, 2014",9,I decided to visit a psychiatrist for the first time 2 weeks ago because I have been dealing with anxiety and mild depression for almost 2 years. He prescribed me sertraline 50mg. I didn't start until a week later because I was scared (anxiety) about taking medicine for the first time and the possible consequences so I kept reading about it especially in this site. So after taking the medication for a week (first 5 days I only took half a pill per day) I can only say that it's been a positive experience. My anxiety is almost gone and I feel much happier and calmed. I can study and work without feeling anxious and fearful or depressed feeling sad.Cons: thirsty all the time; dry mouth. During the first 5 days only I felt sleepy and a little bit numb.,Jazminnn
