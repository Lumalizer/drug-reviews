0,Wellbutrin,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 16, 2022",3,Wellbutrin or Bupropion is by far the best medicine I've taken for relieving depression.  It takes time on this med so don't give up too soon.  I have been on 300mg for 6 months and I am seeing results that I never saw with other antidepressants and I have taken most of them at one time or other. Every antidepressant I've taken in the past caused me such apathy I can't function. I now have pleasant or even joyous thoughts occasionally and I am getting interested in life again.,GrNana
1,Wellbutrin,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 18, 2022",1,"I had high hopes starting on Wellbutrin given that it was much different than the previous antidepressants I had tried. The side effects though within just the first two weeks were awful. I had dealt with many medications side effects before, but with this, I could not stop shaking and my heart was constantly racing (120+ bpm constantly). I was throwing up, yet also not hungry at all. On multiple occasions, I almost passed out, feeling almost feverish. I had wanted to stick it out and see if they went away, but I felt so awful I didn’t even have it in me to try and wait any longer.",Anonymous

5,Wellbutrin,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 23, 2021",1,"Although I hoped it would work (I had Wellbutrin XL), it resulted in a sharp chest pain, tight chest, and blurred vision about 2 days after starting, and 5-6 hours after the dosage. The next few days I was on it, the effects became worse, including terrible mental effects (although I am an 18 year old male, and I knew that as it had a black box warning, it had a possibility).",E1880
6,Wellbutrin,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 15, 2021",2,"It took about 2 months for me to begin to feel the effects, but it was worth it. Prior to starting Wellbutrin I tried Lexapro, Zoloft, Prozac, Cymbalta, and a fifth I can't remember, and none of them had any effect on me. After wellbutrin kicked in, my motivation returned, I was able to focus a little easier, and I reduced my stress eating. I have found that my depressive symptoms correlate strongly with my ADHD (a bad ADHD day will be a bad MDD day, and vice versa) and wellbutrin works well to combat this. The only downside is that my insomnia has become even worse, but until can find a better solution than wellbutrin, this is something I will have to put up with.",Conquistador
7,Wellbutrin,Major Depressive Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 22, 2021",4,"Currently on this medication 150mg daily. I expected the side effects to be bad after reading some reviews here and they were lol. Thought so many people said it would calm down after the first month but it's been longer than that. Usually for me the nausea is the worst thing. I never want to eat anything, food just disgusts me most of the time now. I felt like it was really helping the depression a few weeks ago but now I am more suicidal than ever. Also my anxiety is horrible. Many days I don't want to leave the house. I used to be agoraphobic about 10 or so years ago (in my teens) and now I feel myself heading that direction again. It also has really affected my sleep. Or at least that's what I'm assuming. I have been having a very hard time getting to sleep and then if I wake up from something it's even harder to fall back asleep. It just sucks. The only plus is that it doesn't increase my appetite. Hope this helps.",Anonymous
8,Wellbutrin,Major Depressive Disorder,4.0,,"August 19, 2021",3,"I believe this is an overall fantastic drug, but likely not the best fit for those with a history of chronic insomnia. I was prescribed Wellbutrin after quitting Lexapro (to avoid sexual dysfunction associated with SSRIs) and experienced a temporary decrease in my depression, but developed horrific insomnia that lasted the entire duration of my use of Wellbutrin. Because I was chronically underslept for a period of 6 months, my depression and panic disorder worsened exponentially to a critical point which resulted in me quitting Wellbutrin. Thankfully, Wellbutrin was much easier to taper off and quit than conventional SSRIs! No brain zaps or severe withdrawals. Give this drug a chance but be weary if you already battle with sleep.",Veronica
9,Wellbutrin,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 14, 2021",7,I started taking Wellbutrin 150mg SR about 3 years ago. It didn't help my depression very much. I finally started seeing a psychologist that told me it has to be taken 12 hours apart. So I was taking it at 8am and sometimes wouldn't take it till 11 pm or I'd forget a dose. I was finally switched to 300 mg 1x along with buspar for anxiety & a mood stabilizer. The mood stabilizer is the best medication I've ever taken. It's helped me 100%. With the Wellbutrin XL I started out with tons of energy and no appetite but after awhile that stopped. So if you're taking the SR and it's not working I'd switch to the SL once a day. Once I switched it started working.,Somer21311
10,Wellbutrin,Major Depressive Disorder,7.0,,"April 21, 2021",18,"I’ve suffered from pretty severe major depressive disorder & anxiety  since I can remember, diagnosed since I was 18 (now 25). Tried prozac, zoloft, effexor, lexapro, & none really helped me escape the deep hurt I felt 24/7. About 16 months ago I started taking this drug, building up to 300mgXL over a 2 week timespan. That was a pretty horrific time if I’m being honest - manic, crawling out of my own skin, couldn’t sleep at all. But then my doctor added 100mg of serequel at night for my sleep. Over the next 3 months I felt myself lift out of the darkness a little. She also added an anti-anxiety (klonopin).Wellbutrin didn’t solve my depression, but it definitely did help save my life. If you’re just trying it out for the first time, try to get past the bad side effects in the beginning if you can, It’s been worth it for me anyways. Long term side effects have been anxiety, reduced appetite, memory loss, restlessness, nausea & some confusion/disorientation.",dprsdNanxty

For the positives, I have noticed increased motivation, increased libido, and decreased appetite. I haven't lost much weight yet but I have PCOS so I know that's going to take time. As for side effects, I sometimes experience drowsiness within an hour or two of each SR dose. I also notice that I become very cold sensitive and need to bundle up to stay warm, but this goes away as each dose wears off. I have occasional premature heartbeats and they seem to be happening more often on Wellbutrin. I've also noticed my dreams are more vivid.",Sta

13,Wellbutrin,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 20, 2021",482,"Like others on this site, I have tried so many antidepressants.  SSRIs take away any sexual feeling for me, and I tend to put on weight and not have the best self image with them.  Buproprion is the only medication that really allows me to FEEL my feelings, and talk more easily in social settings.  After your adjust (some insomnia for a few weeks) it actually helped me to sleep better.  It took me a few times of trying this medication to really get it to work for me.  It helped with my anxiety rather than making it worse, but depression was my biggest problem, hopelessness, fatigue etc.  This medication makes jokes funny, trees prettier and makes me feel emotionally stronger.  Remember that it takes courage and patience to get help and to stick with it until it works.  God bless.",alive13

I made an effort with regard to my career and managed to land the job of my dream.After month 4, I was put on the full 300XL. My brain feels healed. My pathways that were broken for years are now lighting up in my brain. A lot of people think this drug is a strong stimulant but I’ve taken Ritalin and it’s WB is no where close!

I began having dreams and sexual desires. I continued thinking things would change but they got worse. Weeks later I began to hallucinate and even forgot where I parked my car after going shopping one day and ended up calling police and reported it stolen when it wasn’t. I also started seeing things that weren’t there and having really dark thoughts. This drug took over my life and caused me to make irrational decisions like up and moving 1200 miles across country for no apparent reason whatsoever. A situation I regret! I got a second opinion and was taken off of wellbutrin immediately and given a psych evaluation. I was given prozac and trazadone but no longer take them. I just got a puppy, I changed my diet and lifestyle and learned coping mechanisms. I will never take another pill if I can help it.",Joy

I've smoked on and off for 20+ years and I can't say it helps me in that area--at least not at the dose I'm taking.

When I started I felt dazed and sedated, but wired and jittery at the same time. My insomnia was horrible. Other side effects I experienced included tinnitus, horrible anxiety, hand tremors, heart palpitations, and a really short temper. I desired nothing, but had the energy to do everything - weird combo. OKAY, now for the GOOD, and things I think people should know before giving up this medication - the side effects last a LONG time (two and a half months for me), but they DO all go away. I was now able to get up early to workout, got into cooking, lost weight, and felt hopeful about life. Sex also got WAY better now that I could stop living in my head, which was a huge plus.

23,Wellbutrin,Major Depressive Disorder,5.0,,"June 30, 2020",27,"Let me start off by saying my body is super weird and sensitive to medication. I do not need a high dose of anything and I typically get side effects with anything I take. I took 30mg of Wellbutrin for about a month and within that month was miserable. I had very bad gut pain and digestive issues, so my doctor dropped me down to 15mg. I was on that for another 2 weeks before quitting. So in 45 days of being on Wellbutrin, I got terrible adult acne on my face and chest, severe digestion issues and gut pain, and gained 10-12 pounds in water weight (I felt bloated 24/7 - like I was on my period), headaches and had severe angry outburst (which is not to my character). It is a bummer I had such horrible side effects because it really did help greatly with my depression, it also gave me a huge sex drive (which my husband loved!). But there were just too many had side effects to justify staying on it.",E
24,Wellbutrin,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,,"June 14, 2020",364,"This drug Wellbutrin has been life changing for me. After trying SSRIs and SNRIs that didn’t work, it did the trick. Yes, it sucks at first; the side effects are horrible but you have to give it time. And on these meds at first, I got the head zaps, anxiety like I had never felt before, heart palpitations, lack of appetite and weight loss, headaches, nausea, severe insomnia- the whole nine yards. But after about 5 months on 300 mg, I turned a corner and feel better than ever. I can focus, I’m not tired but can sleep if I need to, my anxiety largely went away, I’m happy and can orgasm too. All the side effects pretty much subsided, save for the appetite one... I still don’t have to eat if I don’t want to but I’m not repulsed by the idea of food anymore.

I was hoping this would be the one— I’ve been back and forth on a lot of meds but nothing has worked. I felt severely angry and would lash out. I’ve never been that way.

They always go away over time. This is the only medication that has been able to increase my energy levels and sex drive. I also have GAD, have had psychotic depression in the past, and panic attacks in the past. This drug doesn’t exacerbate any of those problems for me. I’m also on Seroquel though so that probably helps with my sleep. Many antidepressants have given me terrible headaches but this one does not. I get migraines a few time’s a year, same as before.

However, now that I'm on Trintellix, I'm thrilled to get off Wellbutrin which is the cause of so many complaints as a generic. Also, with Trintellix, there's no time-release (SR or XL) - so, this eliminates the dispensing of the drug in the body at various rates - as can be felt between generic and brand.

My partner and I was always arguing at mostly the fault of my own. I had such a hard time getting out of bed and taking on the day. I would absolutely need a mid afternoon four hour nap to get me through. Wellbutrin has given me so much mental clarity. It has saved my relationship. And it’s allowed me to go through my days feeling normal. The only downfall is it gives me a very dry mouth which is not good for my overall oral health but I have found some toothpaste and mouthwash that help a little.

The psych nurse practitioner advised Wellbutrin to get away from the weight gain and sexual side effects.I've been on 75mg once per day for nearly 8 weeks now and honestly I'm still unsure.  I've lost 15lbs and my interest in sex has increased a little.  I've had really bad agitation especially in the first few weeks that made me want to scream.

I take two 150mg a day in the morning with my breakfast.

He started introduce  150mg of Wellbutrin for 2 weeks while I reduced the Prozac. The Wellbutrin started working after about a week. My mood was a lot better and had more emotions. I also feel more motivated to eat right, workout, and improve my appearance. I'm now on one 10mg Prozac in the morning and 2 separate doses of Wellbutrin (300mg total).
