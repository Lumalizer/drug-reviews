0,Remeron,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 7, 2022",6,"I was in another deep dark place. Have been on lexapro for years because I struggle w MDD. It seems the lex doesn’t help much like it used to. When I go downhill, my stomach is affected. I lose my appetite and can barely eat. I get these gnawing hunger pains, and eat to get rid of them, but then shortly after I’m hungry again but nothing sounds good or tastes good. I’m afraid of trying new meds. It’s so hard. So many don’t help and you have to be on them for quite awhile to know if they work. I’ve tried several in the past and they gave me chest pressure/pain. Unusual, but it happens. Didn’t want to try remeron but I was desperate. God heard my many prayers and many who were praying for me!  Started feeling better and eating normal within a week! Crazy dreams and shaky for awhile, but that got better. Also, am gaining weight back that I lost.",Mary

I was 125lb when I started the medication and now I’m bordering on overweight. Luckily when I stopped the medication the weight gain stopped. It helped  slightly with my chronic migraines and did not make me sleepy. I feel it did improve my quality of sleep somewhat, but not enough to continue gaining weight at that rate. I did exercise and watch what I ate but it just made me too hungry. It had no effect on my depression unfortunately, and I feel much worse about myself after gaining all that weight.

She sometimes is completely confused and becomes even hostile towards me, her husband of 50 years. I have experimented with various doses of Remeron and found out that giving her 15mg doses three times a day is effective  and usually keeps her in a reasonable to good mood. In the evening her anxiety comes back about our cats who are used to go outside. I give her a small  alcoholic drink (Irish Cream) which has a very beneficial effect on her. Remeron does not seem to interact negatively with alcohol. One hour before bedtime I give her 10 mg of Melatonin. She sleeps very well. I have found that 15 mg of Remeron in the morning, 15 to 30 mg at 2 pm and sometimes another 15 mg in the evening is a very good combination.I know that one should not give more than 45 mg a day, but sometimes and additional dose at night is necessary.",Fred

I still experience panic attacks, occasional chest tightness if I think about it, but panic attacks have significantly gone down to at least maybe once a month if not every other month. I have gained few pounds. If you have a sensitive stomach, eating right before or after taking this medication else you'll feel bad waves of nausea. My parents hid panic disorder as a child and lied to me about it so, I started experiencing them much more often in high school. have I honestly never felt better mentally. I can't say enough good things about this medication! Wait it out if you really think this will work for you.

Even though it doesn't work sometimes, it definitely helps with mood, sleep, and your appetite when it does. I guess bc I've taken it for so long, my body thinks it's a Skittle. But skipping a week or just taking it when needed has better results for me. Without it, I tend to lose weight everyday from the effects of not eating when I'm busy. This helps me to keep my appetite and energy up until the next dosage. I hope this post and the medicine helps someone else as well.

I found that nothing that could help. Every night I tossed and turned, waking up every 2 hours. The first night I took this, like magic, I slept a whole night without waking up. And every night since then it has worked. However, BEWARE, it will make you binge eat. You have NO control over it. Studies say weight gain from this med only affects like 15% of people. Use look at the reviews on here and across the internet–it's more like 90%. I've always been skinny and I put on 14 pounds within a month of starting it. I quit for a week, which made me extremely depressed and unable to sleep, but I immediately lost all the weight. But I was so depressed, it hurt, so I got back on it. That's why I give this a 7, it's a conundrum, it helps so much with insomnia/depression/anxiety but it makes you FAT.

I  paid 8 a piece for them both, at my insurance's expense. When I first started , the first two days were horrible. I was drained and hungry as heck, but my body adapted quick.  I lost 25 lbs before taking remeron and so far my weight has increased by 5 to 6lbs. I have nightmares almost every night and mood swings when I don't eat.. but thats just the downside.

I told my doctor my problems and with the things that I was looking to have alleviated, he recommended Remeron. I have had extreme appetite suppression for a long time as well due to my depression, and I needed a medication to increase my appetite. I was having trouble sleeping due to overthinking at night. I had a lot of ideation. Remeron helped me with all of these symptoms. It helps me eat like a normal person would. It is quite sedative, so it helps with sleep, which is super important for depression, to get enough. And it helped overall with mood. A good one!",Kay

I could hardly walk the dog and I felt constipated too. I think the reason people gain weight is because you want to eat to counteract the sluggish feeling with fuel from food - although it doesn't work. I l slept all day and night and am still to weak. I think it is a bad drug and will harm more than help. You couldn't pay me to take it again.  consider a natural way instead.",jean
26,Remeron,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 25, 2018",23,"I took this because I was severely suicidal and depressed due to seasonal MDD. I started it because my mother was worried and I though If I went on medication it would let her relax a little. It helped me sleep and completely erased my suicidal thoughts and urges. I got a restful full night’s sleep every night. At the start the downsides were an inability to focus, feeling extremely tired during the day and having my suicidal thoughts and urges increase drastically. These only lasted like a few days then everything was okay again. The only side effect that didn’t go away was weight gain, but I’d rather be heavier and alive than skinny and dead. I only went off of it because my depression is seasonal so I don’t need it at this time of year, but I will definitely start again in the fall.",Seasonal Sadness

I ended up in behavioral health facility for 2 weeks because of a major depressive episode and constant thought of suicide. They gave me this medication and I stuck with it. Initially it will make you sleepy and crave food like crazy.  You will also have crazy dreams. This will pass in time.  I haven’t fallen into a depression in over 3 years now , which is a record. I have recently lost my job, because of a different medical condition. I am on food stamps and might have to sell my home, but amazingly it’s no big deal to me. Remeron and other forms of therapy have changed my whole outlook on life. If anyone has tried every medication and it hasn’t worked give this one a try.

I was skeptical at first, and the initial side effects scared me (slurred speech, drowsiness, blurred vision), however I kept with it and I feel so much better. It is relieving being able to live without thinking I am about to get fired, or if I am getting fat (which is ridiculous. I actually have an eating disorder and I am clinically underweight). My neurotic paranoia seems to be somewhat cornered and I no longer depend on alcohol to keep me under control. I have only been on the drug for a week at 15mg.

I found that my level of depression was worsening over time and I had to take more and more to sleep.  Finally, I decided that I needed to get off of the Restoril.  My doctor prescribed Remeron.  I have been taking it for several weeks now and find that my mood has improved as well as my sleep.  I am down to 1/2 of the Restoril I was taking before and hopefully may be able to discontinue it.  The only downside of Remeron is that my appetite has increased, which is not good for me.  Otherwise, I would have rated this as a 10.",xyz123
53,Remeron,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 20, 2014",156,"I was on Remeron for about 2 years before.  Helped very very much with my depression.  But although I often felt very sleepy near the beginning of the treatment, the massive fatigue eventually subsided to an acceptable level.  20-mins after taking it, I'm ready for bed I can't keep my eyes open no matter what.I just restarted Remeron two days ago, after more than a year being on it.  As I type this, I feel fogged over, sort of sleepy, and immensely ""munchie"".  As before when I took it, I'd find myself waking up several times a night going to raid the fridge and cabinets for munchie or sweet foods (and meats! definitely craved meat all the time).  So again, on Remeron: eating again, sleeping some, more relaxed, less sad. ",steverh
