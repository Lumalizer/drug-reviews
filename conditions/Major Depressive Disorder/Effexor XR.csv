0,Effexor XR,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2022",0,"Took it for about a week and started feeling great. But within a few days my blood pressure increased, I started getting migraines so I had to stop. THE WITHDRAWAL WAS HORRIFIC. So dizzy I could barely walk. Headache 24/7. And the BRAIN ZAPS were unbearable; always came out of nowhere and left me feeling dazed and afraid for my sanity. Not worth trying it, IMO. When you try to get off of it, God help you. You’ll regret ever hearing the name. I can’t believe this medication is legal!",Still Standing
1,Effexor XR,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 22, 2022",1,"This medication is a nightmare. I started off on 37.5mg, then up to 75mg 1x daily. I started getting HORRIFIC brain zaps, it felt like I was getting an electric shock straight to the brain every time I blinked or moved. My doctor then tried 2x a day 75mg, and same thing. By the time I was ready for my next dose, I was a mess with brain zaps. So he put me on 3 TIMES A DAY saying it was just me metabolizing them too quickly. They worked for a little, but pretty soon I went right back to experiencing severe depression and anxiety, and this drug definitely didn’t hold up for serious life changes and additional stress. My current psychiatrist is weening me off of it and says she doesn't like this drug, and has the same issue with many of her patients who came to her after starting it. The withdrawal is a NIGHTMARE. Brain zaps, flu like symptoms, tremors, and wild mood swings with hysterics. I will never recommend this drug.",Anonymous

Tried venlafaxine and had good results for a few months. After that though, it felt like it stopped working. I missed a couple of doses and noticed no difference whether I was off the meds or on them. I, fortunately, did not experience any of the withdrawal symptoms that others report. It simply didn't work for me long-term.",Lauren
3,Effexor XR,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 7, 2022",16,"I was in the deepest, darkest valley of suicidal ideation. I had it all in life and one day, I stopped sleeping, eating, smiling, and functioning. I was miserable. I was scared. I was paralyzed by depression and anxiety. Imagine having an 8-hour panic attack but having such deep depression that you couldn’t move off the couch. I literally just sat and watched the sun come up and go down. Day after day, night after night. After a while, I lost the ability to cry. I thought death was the only solution so I thought about it all the time. Luckily, I gave the doctor a try first and after trying two other medications, we finally tried this one and it completely turned it around for me. Game changer. I started sleeping a little bit longer, eating a few more nibbles, cracking a smile here and there. Started to hear music again. Started to feel like life mattered again. Venlafaxine saved my life. Two years in and I am better than ever. Don’t be afraid! This might be the one for you too!",Anonymous

After my second child was born with health issues my previous conditions worsened. I’d never had much luck with medications anyway but I went on and off a few of the typical ones. Some had no impact, some made things worse. This is helping. I feel good about taking it as it’s making a difference. Like all meds there were side effects in the beginning - they ease up after a couple weeks and it was worth it for me. I’m not crying every day, I’m not filled with rage, I’m not filled with panic. Things are more manageable. My sleep is better. It’s a journey of course but this is helping. I feel a little more like me and the person I am in my head if that makes sense. I was at risk of losing everything and now I feel invested in things. I’m glad I’ve given it a go. Hope this helps someone out there figuring out what’s best.",Anon
6,Effexor XR,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,,"September 3, 2021",4,"I was truly in a deep dark hole when My doctor put me on this. At first I filled the prescription but refused to take it due to all the negative side effects of getting off the drug. However, I was feeling so bad I didn’t care and decided to take it anyway. Almost immediately… Well, at least that day, I started to feel relief. Effexor actually works. My depression improved significantly and I was able to get on with life. I stayed on it for a full year. There were side effects however they were minimal. I did notice I tensed up a lot and clench my teeth. Yes, getting off of this stuff sucks to get off of. This is temporary! I would recommend taking a week off of work. Discontinuing this drug is not the end of the world. It is indeed uncomfortable. Hopefully I never go down that dark road again with depression. I would not hesitate to use this drug again if I needed it. It was a lifesaver.",mikey77

I started on 37.5mg I was  better, but still had a few panic attacks. 75mg cured my anxiety, but I felt extremely suicidal for the first time in a while. I’m now on 150 mg of Effexor, and my Social Anxiety Disorder is gone. I haven’t felt this happy in years. I no longer cry every time I hear my alarm go off in fear for the day and whats coming next.

10,Effexor XR,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 9, 2021",7,"...my goodness.on Effexor XR for 5/6 months, last 6 weeks tapering down. Went from 37.5mg up  to 225mg, never did much for depression or anxiety though it  good rid of any and all NSSI/SI. My main complaint isn't the drug itself, it's stopping it. 6 week taper, feeling fine save for some headache/nausea - until I got to 75mg. Then: always dizzy, more depressed, feeling physically paralyzed. It got worse at 37.5mg, brain zaps causing such bad vertigo that I avoided leaving my appartment. Stopping it entirely, depression was worse than it had been in months, felt too sick to eat, moving my head slightly was enough to cause a migraine. I had so little energy that I - no joke - called my pharmacy to tell them the Adderall they gave me was defective.I was cocky, because I never get any bad side effects from meds. Stopping this med is dangerous: I almost went to the ER 2x, once because I was worried I couldn't to keep myself safe, then because the brain zaps and vertigo were so bad I thought I was going to collapse.

11,Effexor XR,Major Depressive Disorder,2.0,,"January 7, 2021",17,"I was in the hospital for suicidal ideation and they gave me Effexor. I remember I was sick the first night (nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain) but after the second day I magically felt better. The depression felt like it went away and I was ready to be released and start my life back. Well this turned into an EXTREME manic episode less than a week later. I left my relationship of 4 years, I ran off and engaged in dangerous activities, shut everyone out of my life. But I felt happy I was out of my mind. I don’t have bipolar disorder but this is exactly what it felt like. 2 months later this all came crashing down and I ended right back in a psych ward again after trying to commit suicide. My therapist told me she calls it sideffexor because it’s a hit or miss medicine, it either really works or makes things worse.

Only thing was that it made me a little bit numb and I didn’t have many emotions. But otherwise my suicidal thoughts were gone. Also helped with a lot with my insomnia, although I had strange dreams quite often. Have tried taking other antidepressants, I think I have tried every SSRI and SNRI, but effexor was the only one that didn't give me intolerable side effects. I CANNOT tolerate any other medication. Didn’t work well with my social anxiety and GAD, but helped a lot with my depression.

From being tossed on so many different medications in the past and none of them working I was SO desperate to feel better and also hopeless at the same time because I had felt like I had already tried EVERYTHING but I gave it a shot. After 3 months my entire mind set started to change for the better. Little by little I started getting out of bed again, socializing again, I rarely have nightmares anymore, I feel a lot more calm, I don't overthink little things and I genuinely look forward to waking up now. Do not give up on this drug if you don't feel better immediately, nothing will make you completely feel better but this is as close as I've ever gotten.

My mood is way better and I can actually function again. I still have the occasional bad day but now it’s much easier to cope with my depression and snap out of whatever funk I’m in rather than spiraling for months. I really haven’t had any bad side effects while taking venlafaxine at all which is nice. The one thing keeping me from giving it 10/10 is I’ve missed doses every now and then and I get super disoriented, irritable, and emotional within a day of missing a dose, as well as really bizarre vivid dreams that leave me waking up super super dissociated. It’s easy to recognize that these symptoms are because I missed a dose by accident though and they tend to go away within a day of getting back on my medication.

The Citalopram was not effective anymore and my psychiatrist prescribed Effexor XR. I had went through withdrawal from Citalopram which was difficult. However, when I was put on the Effexor XR I was having side effects from the Effexor XR that were worse than the withdrawal from the Citalopram. Severe shaking and nervousness. Heavy sweating and no real relief until 55 days taking it then all of a sudden I felt really good for 9 days. After that I refilled my prescription and the side effects began again...nervousness, shaking, sweating and the depression returned.

I still have overlap symptoms meaning that all my symptoms of depression are still there I just don't feel like I want to die. As for side effects, in the first few weeks all I was was tired, but after the initial few weeks it subsided. After that I really am no help because I went through the tribulation of finding a good anti-anxiety medication. I really do think I am alive now because of the EffexorXR. No improvement in qol because I still deal day to day with depression, but not suicidal.",Kelentaria

89,Effexor XR,Major Depressive Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 17, 2015",15,Effexor works reasonably well for me. I'm on 150mg and for the most part it controls my depression. I do find it better to take this med in the morning. Firstly because I think it lessens the depression for me when I take it at that time. Also it stops the side effect of dizziness for me. If I miss the meds I know about it. As the dizziness does not go away otherwise. That's really the only side effect that I find that's negative about this med.,Tascha
90,Effexor XR,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,,"April 24, 2015",32,"It works wonderfully. I've tried many antidepressants and they all left me feeling, not sad. But I still felt lethargic and hopeless. Effexor gives me motivation and drive. Helps me get out of bed in the morning and off the couch during the day. And it started working within the first week. The ONLY drawback I've found is it really decreases my libido and you CANNOT miss a dose. It will really ruin your day.",149021Samantha

I'm now on 75mg twice a day and I'm finding that for a couple of hours after taking I'm on a high and everything is right with the world but the hours between are really bad, also if you forget to take a tablet the withdraw symtoms are horrific stomach cramps, vomiting, migraine headache, shakes to name a few.  No such problem with the slow release capsules so if your Dr prescribes venlafaxine ask for the MR",ladymorgarna

93,Effexor XR,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,,"January 14, 2015",27,"I was started at a low 75 mg. This was a very dark time emotionally for me because I felt like I was taking candy, not medicine. As we slowly increased the dose,  the heaviness of depression began to lift, but I also became VERY sleepy. Other early side effects was dizziness, insomnia, minor stupor, vivid dreams, stomach cramps, and worsened anxiety. All these are gone except anxiety.We added a sleep aid and Buspar to take as needed for anxiety and insomnia. But I had to up the venlafaxine XR to my doctors max outpatient dose of 225 mg to get rid of the unmanageable depression. This dose combined with CBT (therapy) has greatly increased the quality of my life. But NEVER FORGET A PILL! Withdrawal is awful! Sobbing, ""shocks"", lethargy.",Unbroken0007

My mind was clear, my thoughts and emotions was where they need to be. I felt focused and alert. The only problem was I suffer from high blood pressure, which became out of control.Effexor even help with my night sweats.

There were also several other problems that effexor XR seemed to control or help control.  Depression is painful emotionally, mentally and physically, without the some kind of relief I would have been institutionalized.  For maximum effectiveness, counseling by a person trained in all aspects of the disorder is the only one I found to help bring me back to a realistic understanding of how to heal.  Interestingly, I found several psychiatrists that attempted counseling and were totally inept in their efforts.",triiv

Nothing else has worked. I was on Wellbutrin for 2 years but it quit doing anything and after 4 medicine changes my doctor put me on this. Within a week I was not sulking around, I had energy to get off the couch and shower, and actually found I could laugh again! My husband has noticed the difference in my mood as well. I am having horrible sweats at night, and a little blurry vision along with nightmares/weird dreams. But I'm hoping that might fade some as I take it longer. I'm willing to deal with the side effects at this point as I'm getting myself and my life back.",zmb
