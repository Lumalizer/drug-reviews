0,Escitalopram,Major Depressive Disorder,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 27, 2022",0,"I took this medication for about 8 months, while taking care of my mother who was terminally ill and needed nearly 24/7 care. I’m 22. To have to do this during the pandemic (though I had help from my family) was not great for my mental health, which was already bad. Did Lexapro help? Yes. It also helped a lot for my anxiety, which sometimes felt very debilitating. I was able to take a low dose and still see the effects (around 5mg). Sadly though, the medication made me gain weight. No matter how small the dose, I still gained weight almost every week. I didn’t eat any differently from before, but I ended up gaining almost 20 pounds so I had to stop. Now I feel like I desperately need to get back on meds, but don’t know what to do. I do not want to gain more weight, so sadly don’t think I can go back to this drug :( Hope others experience is not the same.",Daisy Depressy

Found prozac and took a baby dose- 10mg- and it helped my mood, anxiety, irritability, anger, motivation, apathy, isolation, depression… then it stopped working as sometimes happens. I was nervous to switch as it was helpful at one time. We switched to Lexapro as it’s similar and within 2 weeks less depressed, a month mostly recovered, 2 months as good as it’s gonna get:) Noticed 0 side effects and I usually have side effects. I notice I can sleep better, but also struggle with wanting to stop sleeping:) It’s almost too easy to sleep, so it needs a behavioral solution, or I can take halved pills every other day to see:) I don’t feel tired or groggy or even sleepy, it’s just easy for me to fall asleep at rest:) I love this med!

6,Escitalopram,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 26, 2022",3,"I have been using this medication for about a year, starting at 2.5 mg and ending up on 15 mg. I was prescribed it for CPTSD/GAD/MDD. Prescribed to me by my awesome GP. Amazing med but it can take a long time to find the right dose and to work, which requires quite a lot of patience. There are uncomfortable side effects in the beginning (nausea, headache, constipation). These are manageable. Also, around 20 lb weight gain for me, but I was pretty thin to begin with so I didn’t mind. I had to go up a size. This med has given me enough motivation to go to therapy, exercise, eat healthy and practice daily CBT and DBT, as well as mindfulness, all of which help me manage my illnesses. Escitalopram is life saving for me- the reason I’m taking it is for mental illness after sexual assault. I highly recommend it. Work with your doctor or psych to figure out the best dose and approach for you. Very easy to use. I take the med in the morning, it doesn’t affect my sleep that way.",SuperTunnu

Even though it didn't work on my depression after 5 months of use, I wanted to leave it a positive review, since these drugs have the power to save peoples lives.  Initially I experienced basically every side effect possible. Nausea, loss of appetite, night sweats, bad vivid dreams, changes to taste, dizzy, short term memory loss, inability to orgasm, blurred vision in the morning, heart palpitations, headaches, extreme moments of anxiety to the point of throwing up, extreme depression to the point of having to sleep all day. But you know what - this list of side effects sounds horrible, but they are worth it if you start to feel even a little bit like yourself again. After about a month the side effects decreased in severity, my anxiety was gone, but still left me with the inability to orgasm and had no impact on my depression.

Terrible nausea and headaches and had crippling nihilism and suicidal thoughts worse than when I wasn’t being treated. My anxiety came back full swing. I slowly stopped taking it.

Come to find out he was a priest, he prayed for me. Well I met with my Dr fee days later, he said paxil probably stopped working and he put me on Lexapro 20mg.

19,Escitalopram,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 8, 2021",3,"Taking for MDD. Was prescribed cipralex in my early 20s, but at the time had started law school and couldn’t handle the side effects. I stopped taking it after 3 days, which I regret because throughout my 20s and 30s I had major problems due to my depression that affected me and my family negatively. This time (in my mid 30s now) we managed to get through side effects by starting low, going slow. This works for me because I also have anxiety and am super sensitive to medication side effects. Started on 2.5 mg and are working up to 10 mg, which is the minimum required dose for MDD, increasing by 2.5 increments, and staying one each for one month before increasing again. I am really happy with this med- after trying several treatments for my life long depression, it seems to work best, along with daily exercise, and healthy diet.

I was unable to get out of bed in the morning, go to school and could not carry out my normal life due to the constant feelings of hopelessness, sadness, etc. I had lost interest in everything and everyone and also began self harming. Ive been on Lexapro (20 mg) for about four months and it has helped me a large amount with my depression but it makes me feel like a bit of a zombie. The side effects were not the best but it has given me the energy and hope to get out of bed in the morning. Lexapro helped me a immense amount and I would recommend that you try it.",ShawneeB
