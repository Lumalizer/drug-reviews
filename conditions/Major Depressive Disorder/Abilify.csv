1,Abilify,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2022",1,After months of circumstantial and seasonal depression I'm finally asked for some help. I have treatment resistant depression and don't respond well to most antidepressants. After only one week of trying abilify (generic/2mg) I am back to myself...good to go! I am absolutely amazed with a difference it made in such a short period of time. No side effects other than a few hot flashes and those have subsided. I couldn't be happier that my doctor recommended me to try this!,Good2go

3,Abilify,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 11, 2022",1,"I was born with major depression and suffered abuse, so reactive depression was also an issue. Although I was internally sad all the time, I was very successful in school, ballet, piano, violin, art, singing and had lots of friends.  I had learned the poem that begins, Sunday's child is full of grace,""so one day I asked my mother what day I was born, and she scoffed and told me my numeric birthday.  I told her,"" No, the day."" A Wednesday! Wednesday's  child is full of woe. "" At the age of six, I felt doomed. I went through life very successful and sad. In my forties, my doctor prescribed antidepressants which helped, but didn't completely alleviate the depression and sad mood. I saw commercials that touted medicines that added to your  antidepressant would help.  I went to see my doctor, discussed my situation with him, and he suggested trying 5 mg Abilify. After the third day of adding Abilify to my other medicines,I woke up feeling ""normal"" and good. I finally have the ability to be happy!",Reverend R
4,Abilify,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 23, 2021",2,"I've never been diagnosed as Schizophrenic but this made me paranoid and delusional. Strong twitching and noticeable jerking movements, intense anger, frustration, anxiety, unwanted intrusive thoughts, weight gain and various other symptoms. In response, my psychiatrist increased the dose of aripiprazole and added additional meds to combat the symptoms. I stopped seeing friends, stopped attending events I had been going to on a weekly basis for years. Eventually I couldn't even go into a grocery store. 2 days after discontinuing aripiprazole (with new doc's blessing) I landed in a psychiatric ward. It never occurred to me that it was the medication's side effects and not me, my mind, my inability to just put on my ""big girl pants"" and deal with life. Approx 6 years since then and my mind is not the same, I'm not the same. The fallout is real. Then, I was working full time, just promoted and in school. Now, I'm on disability.

5,Abilify,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 20, 2021",4,"I was exhausted and depressed with what mimicked chronic fatigue syndrome. I could barely stay awake everyday and getting through the work day was next to impossible. I also counterintuitively had horrible insomnia and took as many non addictive meds such as Serequel, Melatonin and Hydroxyzine to get to sleep. Even with these meds I still could barely get to sleep and stay asleep. I started back on my Abilify at 5mg two weeks ago and it’s changed my life. I now naturally wake up everyday at 7(ish) and have cut my sleep meds in half. I don’t take my Hydroxyzine anymore. I sleep throughout the night. I still drink coffee because I like it. But I am drinking 10 times less coffee now. I used to just down coffee in hopes that it would help my chronic fatigue, but it was to no avail. I’m not jittery. I’m not wired. I’m just alert and awake. I’m also less depressed.",RyRy

I took it as an augmentation to my antidepressant to see if it would help with my treatment resistant depression. It helped a little but at what price? I'm so ashamed of how I look. I'm in the process of weaning off this horrible drug. Drug companies apparently don't care about terrible side effects....they just care about making money.,Mr. Obese

17,Abilify,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 26, 2021",3,"Abilify was prescribed to me to combat psychotic depression and associated anxiety. However, it caused increasing akathisia (restlessness), seriously blurred vision, insomnia and 'brain zaps.' I'd wake up every hour through the night and finally start moving about at 4am. I couldn't see anything and had to move all the time - if not voluntarily, I'd shake so badly that I had to be prescribed another medication... meant for Parkinson's! Couldn't eat or use my phone at all and I was in excruciating pain. After ""tolerating"" said symptoms for a week, I had a relapse. So no, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone based on my experience.

I'm currently take 300mg of Wellbutrin daily and I just don't notice any difference in my life. I feel numb I feel foggy all of the time. I feel very disconnected from life in general. I'm really praying that this helps I know that no pill is a miracle worker but damn it I need anything at this point that's positive. So I'm going to make another review a month from now or if there are any positive results sooner than that then I'll write a review before but I'm going to give it a month to see if anything changes mentally.

I was suffering from depression and borderline personality disorder and it’s pretty much cured it 100%. It helps my mood so much.

First 10 days, I felt euphoric, energetic, motivated, excited about life.  Well, it came to a screeching halt. I was fidgety, pacing back & forth, would sit & wiggle my feet & legs, was gaining weight, wasn't sleeping & thought I was going crazy. I continued to take it for another 6 weeks to give it a chance. That was a mistake. It was all I could do to make it through a whole workday. I thought I was going out of my mind. I have been off it for 2 years & still have mild side effects, still fidgety, have restless feet & legs, & don't sleep much. As for depression, I feel I was better off before Abilify than now. I appreciate that it has been a wonderful drug for many but where there are so many uncertainties of its effects, I would research it thoroughly before taking it. I don't think most doctors, including psychiatrists, have the slightest clue of how horrible this drug is for most. I would never recommend it to anyone.",LD

I noticed a positive difference within 4 days.  After a few weeks on it I felt even better, had energy & motivation for the first time in years.  I slept better and was ready to get out of bed in the the morning.  However, within 3 months of taking this I gained almost 20lbs.  I had a bit of a weight problem before this so I was of course really freaked out.  My doctor told me it wasn't the Ambilify, it was my eating habits, I knew different but I loved how I felt so I kept taking it. Fast forward 6 months, I've gained 38lbs, I hate the way I look so much I won't leave my house and my depression returned.  I stopped taking it slowly, I've lost my energy and physical things are twice as hard because of my weight.

I've struggled with major Depression since childhood, and had taken pretty much every other drug out there (for 20+ years) before this was prescribed in a very low dose to augment another med I'd already been taking.   I felt NORMAL for the first time in my life.  No, didn't make me ecstatically happy--it made me feel that life was worth living for.    Unfortunately, it didn't help with my anxiety, so I eventually switched to another med in order to take only 1 med, not 3.  It was expensive but so worth it.

Maybe I had personal side effects, but it was a nightmare. I constantly felt restless- my legs would not stop moving and it was extremely difficult for me to sit at work for long periods of time. I also constantly would wake up with migraines and dry mouth.  While it helped with my depression a little bit, it definitely increased my anxiety and ruined my sex drive.Abilify also caused me to have an insatiable appetite. I was always hungry and never felt full. Within 4 months of taking Abilify, I gained 20lbs. After going off the medication, 6 months later my appetite is noticeably different and I dropped 12lbs. Since being off the medication, I feel more like myself and that my personality is returned. Honestly, I can't recommend this unless you have no other options.",Anonymous

I also take Effexor XR, and have for several months now. After one week on the Abilify I began to have a dramatic change in my motivation. I keep myself busy now, where as before I struggled to do simple tasks.  I do struggle with sleeping now. I used to be able to go to sleep anytime I wanted to with no trouble. Now I cannot sleep. I wake up by midnight, and spend the rest of the night doing things like painting, or online shopping!! I cannot sleep. I hope this side effect is temporary. I started taking 3 mg of melatonin before bed, but that only helps a little bit. The other side effect during night is night sweats. It is only after I fall asleep that the sweating occurs. When I wake up I am soaked in my sweat, not too different than when a fever breaks.  As much as I want my ability to sleep back, I will continue to take the abilify because it is changing my life for the better. I no longer sleep all day, or lack motivation.",Bella

I have trialed at least twelve different antidepressants over the last twenty years, with modest results at best.  During my second hospitalization, the attending psychiatrist presented a choice: lithium or aripiprazole (or neither, that was technically a choice, too).  I asked him what he thought and his recommendation was aripiprazole, so we went with that.  We started at 2.5 mg, then quickly moved to 5 mg.  Within days I was no longer having mood crashes, my ruminations had diminished, and my mood had started to recover.  I've stayed out of hospital ever since.  I currently take 10 mg daily and experience no side effects.  I still have my ups and downs (as is life) but my 'down' phases are shorter and much less severe.

I take abilify for MDD with Wellbutrin, and they're a great combo for me. The wellbutrin is great for my mood, and abilify allows me to get off the couch. I was worried when I started taking abilify because I didn't feel anything at all until day 9 or 10, so give it some time to start working.I haven't experienced any side effects, and have actually lost weight because of how much more I'm moving around.

46,Abilify,Major Depressive Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 20, 2019",13,Was placed on Abilify this past May due to continued symptoms of depression and anxiety related to body dysmorphia. My dr started on 5 mg Abilify along with Pristiq. Within a week or so I started noticing less preoccupations with my appearance and less depressed. Unfortunately my penis felt rubbery and no libido. No other side effects except maybe some weight gain. Told my dr and he said the more you take Abilify the better you’ll feel and your libido will improve. Continued to feel better but libido never improved. Then I found out I have low testosterone which I believe is from Abilify. I’m 41 years old! Starting researching and found that many anti psych meds affect prolactin which affects testosterone. This med helped but affected my sexual health. Now I’m depressed and anxious again-can’t win!,mont

The weight gain was absolutely crushing and completely demoralizing. Ability did very little to improve or stabilize my mood. When I went on it, I was suicidal.

The good: this drug really changed my life.  I'd tried a laundry list of antidepressants and they were mostly like popping sugar pills--they didn't do much at all.  My psychiatrist suggested adding Abilify and it did something that no drug had ever done for me: it stabilized my mood (which was all over the map) .  It allowed me to be happy and productive for the first time ever in my adult life.  The bad: I have consistently gained weight every year I've been on the drug, with no sign of a plateau.  I'm experimentally discontinuing it to see if I can lose the weight (which is, counter-productively, making me depressed again).",Greenbeans
