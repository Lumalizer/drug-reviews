1,Mirtazapine,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 25, 2022",7,"I’ve been googling for weeks they’ve been sitting in kitchen my anxiety and depression got bad I couldn’t even care for my kids stopped leaving house I have health anxiety also I google everything then feel 100 times worse but last week.  Then I just thought what have I got to lose and  took 15mg of mirtazapine woke up felt bit tired but once up was ok. I didn’t feel sad I managed to clean bathroom and do the kitchen which something I couldn’t  do before. When I’m talking about something now I feel like I am in control no crazy thoughts like I need to get out here or I’m freaking out  about stupid things making myself worse. I was  just getting out of control. Now I seem to think positive and I’m not in sheer panic over stupid things it got to a point I was checking my pulse, taking blood sugars thinking I was ill remember the mind is a very powerful thing. I never thought I’d ever take tablets because I’m scared of everything but so glad I did",Laura
2,Mirtazapine,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 11, 2022",1,I have been taking mirtazapine for 8 months of 15mg. I had major depression with anxiety panic attacks and insomnia.. I was struggling to work as the lack  of sleep made me feel ill at work and often faint. After 1 month of taking them my panic attacks stopped. And I slept..  I have  however reduced them to 7.5 as I had issues waking up in the morning with a bad headache.  And feel a lot better now. I am also able to work. So a really good antidepressant for insomnia and panic attacks.  However I have put some weight on.  But worth it for the positive benefits it gives.,Roxanne

Have been on lexapro for years because I struggle w MDD. It seems the lex doesn’t help much like it used to. When I go downhill, my stomach is affected. I lose my appetite and can barely eat. I get these gnawing hunger pains, and eat to get rid of them, but then shortly after I’m hungry again but nothing sounds good or tastes good. I’m afraid of trying new meds. It’s so hard. So many don’t help and you have to be on them for quite awhile to know if they work. I’ve tried several in the past and they gave me chest pressure/pain. Unusual, but it happens. Didn’t want to try remeron but I was desperate. God heard my many prayers and many who were praying for me!  Started feeling better and eating normal within a week! Crazy dreams and shaky for awhile, but that got better. Also, am gaining weight back that I lost.",Mary

6,Mirtazapine,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 30, 2021",1,"I too am writing this for those scrolling with anxious thoughts about trying or switching an antidepressant. I increased mirtazapine this evening from 7.50 to 15mgs. I have clinical depression and anxiety, and have been taking Paxil at 20 mgs for two years. Paxil is a good medicine for me but I can not sleep with it. It does not matter when I take it. So I have taken 7.50 mgs. of Mirtazopine as a sleep agent at night for a few weeks.  I sleep very sound once asleep.  (I take a very low dose of melatonin a bit later if I don't fall asleep.  But once in a sleep mode I am resting soundly.) I still take Paxil in the morning.  But I am concerned about weight gain being on both of these medicines.  Paxil has caused me to gain several pounds to an overweight for my size. Mirtazapi hneas increased my carb cravings. My goal is to cross over to the mirtazapine alone for all of the issues from depression. I've tried many other ADs and have only found paxil and mirtazapine to work best so far.",3Shadows

I have always refused taking medication after a bad experience years ago with citalopram. This time around I spiralled after a bad breakup and had brief psychotic disorder. I hardly left my bed. Couldn't eat. Couldn't sleep. My doctor prescribed me this medication and it has worked wonders. Slept a full night and 3 days in I was eating again. I'm on day 9 now and I am already experience positives to my mood. I have hardly had any side effects which is also a bonus! Everyone is different but for me this medication saved my life.,Anonymous
8,Mirtazapine,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 14, 2021",1,"I was prescribed this after being diagnosed with MDD. I was having difficulty sleeping and had a reduced appetite (along with a history of ED). Started with half a pill (7.5mg) for two weeks and worked up to a full pill (15mg). The first two weeks I was insatiably hungry, feeling very groggy, and having such vivid dreams that I was waking up multiple times (4-7 times) per night. After upping the dose to the 15mg a lot of the drowsiness subsided and the hunger became easier to manage. It definitely took the intensity out of the depression. I was feeling a bit more anxious, most notably ""rushes"" of anxiety that made me pretty jumpy for a couple of weeks. This eventually subsided too. As someone who always took ages to fall asleep, I love that 45mins after I take my dose I will be asleep. I'm still able to access a full range of emotions, which I really like because I always fear taking an antidepressant would flatline me emotionally.  I tried 22.5mg and it was far too sedating for me.",MBP
9,Mirtazapine,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 11, 2021",1,"My experience on Mirtazapine was interesting. This antidepressant was very different compared to the Prozac  was originally on for a year. I was really struggling with a loss of appetite and being underweight due to depression and grief. When I started Miryazapine/Remeron, it made me really groggy. An increased appetite and drowsiness is one of the main side effects of it, and I felt both. Thankfully I was able to gain a very big appetite and good eating habits and reached a healthy weight. The drowsiness however does affect me negatively. As I’ve adjusted more, it’s not as bad. I got amazing sleep when taking it, it knocks you out really good. I was able to rest and my anxiety got better. Overall, it helped me. HOWEVER, it’s important to evaluate and note your symptoms, and consider the side effects. I’d say it’s worth giving it a try if your Psychiatrist truly believes it could benefit you.",CAA
10,Mirtazapine,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 13, 2021",2,"I have to say with total honesty that Remeron (mirtazapine) has been a miracle drug for me.  I suffer from major depressive disorder severe with psychotic features.  This drug was put to the test when my husband abandoned me and the resulting divorce I filed for came about.  The stress I have been feeling these past couple of months is something that would almost certainly trigger an episode for me.  Like some kind of miracle, I have not felt a single bit of depression at all!  I have had some breakthrough psychotic symptoms at times from the stress and that’s always a scary experience, but nothing that has prevented me from working or living out my daily life.  I am totally grateful that I was put on this drug.  I’m 31 and I have suffered with this condition since I was 11 and it took 20 years to find a drug that worked for me and I am truly grateful that I can find some relief from that nightmare",Michael

15,Mirtazapine,Major Depressive Disorder,6.0,,"September 15, 2021",3,"I started taking mirtazapine about 5 months ago, beginning with 7.5mg and eventually 30mg. My doctor prescribed this as I had MDD which caused severe unintentional weight loss of 25lbs and insomnia. The most positive benefit I felt from this medication was that it actually gave me the desire to eat again. My doctor instructed me to take it before bed, which I initially tried, but I am used to taking medications like ambien right before getting into bed because of how quickly they take effect. However, mirtazapine has never caused drowsiness for me. I think it helped me fall asleep easier for a while, but it never directly caused drowsiness. Mirtazapine was most beneficial to me when I learned to take it in the early evening rather than at night, so I had a few hours to eat before getting ready for bed. mirtazapine no longer worked after a few months. I noticed that it made me very antisocial and apathetic.. it definitely impacted my relationships. Some positive and some negative results",Anonymous

What led to my diagnosis was I had become overwhelmingly fatigued and also had panic problems, I felt like I was dying. But the doctors all said it was ""just anxiety"". What it was was hypomania. The fatigue and all the other body symptoms were from not really sleeping. Once I got diagnosed I took lithium and Remeron. I felt better almost immediately. The Remeron helped me sleep right away at 7.5 my for the first week. I had no side effects. I take 15 my every night and its my 3rd month on it. I get the munchies very badly at bedtime and I have gained weight in the middle. I sleep easily 10 straight hours. But its worth it, I feel, because I am not having major depression, physical symptoms of ptsd or fatigue, and I sleep well. All the terrible symptoms I was experiencing because of fatigue and mania are gone. The Remeron is prescribed to me to help with depressive episodes and also help me sleep when I'm manic.

I eventually tried lamotrigine which gave me a rash & swelling of lymph nodes. I tried lurasidone which seemed to help but too expensive to continue w/o health insurance.

On day 9 of being on this medication I woke up feeling so much lighter. It is a feeling that I will never forget. About 6 months ago, I noticed I started feeling off again. I upped my dose from 15mg to 30 mg but it didn’t help. I added Wellbutrin but that made me more anxious so stopped, then added abilify which did nothing so stopped, then Seroquil... the list goes on and on.

Eventually increased to 45mg recently but after being on 30mg for several years the extra 15mg seemed to reignite my urge to eat everything in sight which I don’t like as you just end up over eating.

The ONLY negative things that have to do with this drug for me are that I get sweaty at night and have had a few nightmares, however they are very tolerable as i've never been actually scared of my nightmares. PLEASE try this medication, it may change your life as i've barely been on it a month and it's changed mine.",kate

The SSRI worked for a couple of months until my life took on more responsibility. I started to feel depressed and anxious again. One major side effect of the SSRI was a significant reduction in sex drive. Being a male, that lowered my confidence even more. I've been on mirtazapine for 2 weeks now, still early days. However, since being on it I immediately experienced improvements. My sex drive has returned to normal, I sleep much better, and I am more excited about life in general. The only real side effect I've experienced is dizziness on a daily basis. Hopefully this will go away in a few weeks.",170

Now I have a great excuse to retreat to bed because I am tired a lot of the time and when I am not tired my brain feels foggy and my short term memory is fuzzy. I do physically demanding work that I can't keep up with well at the moment. As for my mood, I am definitely more irritable and no less low so far but I will give this another week and see what happens.",Twitch123

I upped the dosage to 30 mg on the third day, and after a week I am feeling so much better! It doesn't completely knock me out right away like the first night but just makes me a little tired.
