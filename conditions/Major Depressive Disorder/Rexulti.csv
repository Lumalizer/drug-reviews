0,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 11, 2022",0,"This review is for folks desperate for any glimmer of hope while getting sucked down into the oblivion of a depression spiral, alone & empty. I've been on Lexapro 10 mg (anxiety + obsessive ruminations) and Vyvanse 10 to 40 mg (focus + energy) for years now, but the last year or so they just haven't cut it. I actually had to take a 3-month, short-term leave from work because I was too depressed to lift up a laptop and do the basic functions of my job, let alone keep up proper hygiene, etc. With Ketamine infusion and ECT looking like the only options for my oppressive existence, my psychiatrist let me know he had a patient who, like me, didn't respond to a lot of meds in the past but had great success with Rexulti. I was skeptical but hopeful. My hope = proven right. I've been on .5 mg for 10 days now, and I can honestly say I don't dread waking up in the morning anymore. Relationships are better.

1,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 6, 2022",1,My psychiatrist added this as an adjunct for my persistent depressive disorder and it has been wonderful. I am not fond of the copay amount but she gave me a copay card so I don't pay over $15 a month. Only side effect is sweating at night but I can control that.,adriane7
2,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 15, 2022",1,I took samples of this. The shakes are pretty hard to take and to function. I don't see any benefit to this. There are class actions I got a lot of weight gain from any antipsychotic.,Eve Kurzer
3,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 8, 2022",0,This drug did nothing except make me gain weight. I gained 15lbs in a month. Not worth it.  Makes me more depressed that I have gained weight. My clothes are hard to fit now.,Lilmissmollysue2022
4,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 31, 2022",2,"I am wondering if anyone else has had my very distressing experience with Rexulti. My psychiatrist had me on 400 mg of Welbutrin, which put a floor under my depression, but did not get me into positive territory.  He had me supplement Rexulti 0.5 mg on-and-off for several months, with no noticeable benefit.  He then increased my Rexulti dosage to 1.0 mg.  Within 48 hours I had full-on Parkinsonian symptoms; inability to hold a glass with one hand or to write anything legibly. I tapered off of the Rexulti over a few days and my psychiatrist said that the Parkinsonianism would fade in a couple of weeks.  Instead, it took over six months. More distressingly, to this day, 16 months later, motion (like walking across a room), eating a big meal or, in particular, focusing on a manual task (like minor plumbing under a sink) frequently sends me into debilitating tremors and brain fog, that can last for a few hours or a couple of days. Has anyone encountered this and maybe found a treatment?",Steve
5,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 14, 2022",5,"Rexulti has been a LIFE SAVER!!! I started on 40 mg of Viibryd 3 months ago, and it was only controlling 60% of my depression. Not good enough. Enter Rexulti. Started at 0.5 mg and saw immediate results within 4 days. Took about 6 weeks for the medicine to fully incorporate into my system. The starting dose brought my depression from 60% controlled, to 85%! Just wow! Now I'm on 1 mg for 2 weeks and my depression is GONE! God this is a miracle drug for me. I was skeptical at first, but I gave it a chance and boy oh boy am I glad I took up my psychiatrist's offer. What a true life saver and a blessing. Depression is the most painful of all human emotions, and it's always imperative that I do everything I can to find relief and Rexulti has led me to the promised land!",HereditaryBane
6,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 21, 2021",1,"I started Rexulti 0.5mg for five days and I can honestly say I noticed an improvement in my depression the first day or so. Once the medication began to get into my system good I started feeling very heavy with fatigue, excessive eating, swollen tummy also very nauseous in the mornings and a busting headache.  My conclusion is the slight benefits I received from this drug isn't worth the side effects. This drug can have dangerous side effects and some not so dangerous.  It affects blood sugar levels as well.  Definitely not worth it in my opinion when there are over medications available for depression.",My experience R

9,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 18, 2021",1,I always read reviews but never leave one. I have been taking Rexulti for over a year now. It was the best medicine I have tried for depression. I played around with the doses and took up to 2mg. Now I am only on .25. I take rexulti along with Prozac 20mg. I am 90% better since being on this medication. If you haven’t tried rexulti I highly suggest it. It starts working in as little as 3-5 days and reaches better results at 2 weeks. Don’t suffer with depression when you can treat it. Also if you don’t do therapy/counselling I suggest you do that in combination it works great also. These 3 changes I have made have made a drastic improvement in my life. Oh and I will add my faith in God and prayer. Thank you Lord.,Bry
10,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 12, 2021",2,"Rexulti is my game changer. I am 59 years old and have been increasingly depressed from the time I was 6 years old, which is when my father started abusing me. I remember my 5-year old self as exuberant, excited and enthusiastic and courageous, those traits were snuffed out by almost 15 years of abuse. My depression became so bad that at 52 I retired on disability. I’ve taken many antidepressants; now I take prozac and Wellbutrin. They work—but it felt like depression had been lessened but nothing positive was added. Rexulti took my recovery to a whole new level—I went from extremely depressed to exuberant in less than 2 weeks. I felt better within a few days but then it just kept going up. I started at 1 mg and am now at 2 mg. I have experienced none of the side effects.  Like many, was shocked about $400/mo copay.  Then I found that mail order, through same insurance company,  is $40/mo. Don’t give up, there is a solution for you. :)",MiMi55
11,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2021",0,"I have been checking in with my doc every 4 weeks for the past year. We have switched almost every month. It was overwhelming  with the nausea, weight gain, etc.. Nothing worked. These past 3 weeks I could not get out of bed. I lost a few friends and a family member I watched almost die all within the past 3 months. These waves knocked me out. The doc said let's try Rexulti. I was desperate. Willing to ride out the side effects. This time I could not even leave my room, go to to the doctors, grocery store.No lie! No side effects and feel AMAZING within a week. 4 days to be exact. It might not work for you but have hope and give it a try. I have bi polar ll and my rapid cycling is exhausting.

12,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 31, 2021",2,"Rexulti was the answer for me. Diagnosed with GAD and MDD. Prescribed 20mg Cipralex to start which was fine, no complaints. Then added 150mg Wellbutrin which first made things worse, then after 8 weeks felt okay but by no means better. GP got rid of the Wellbutrin and started me on 0.5mg Rexulti and increases to 1mg after 7 days in conjunction with the Cipralex. I can honestly say that I have never felt better. Noticed a difference after 5 or 6 days. Only side affects are some nausea and very vivid dreams- but I’ve noticed this with all 3 meds. I am so thankful for my GP prescribing me Rexulti.",Anonymous
13,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 24, 2021",1,"Tldr: 10/10. Been depressed since ~10 years old. Rexulti changed my life for the better in less than 1.5 months. Newly 'chubby' but happy. Able to feel alive again.I never knew how 'normal' was supposed to feel like since I can't remember what it was like; I've been depressed since I was 10 years old. All I knew is that how I felt wasn't how I should feel. I could tell people felt a wider range of emotions than me: passion, love and happiness. Some medications seemed to help but never enough.Now I feel like the past few decades were a hazy dream that I've finally woken up from. It's as if I am in control again and not my depression. I even tend to surprise myself with my boldness and confidence now.The only negative is that I've gained ~10 lbs (115 to 125 lbs or so) in the last 2 months before I could keep track of what and how much I was eating. Everything is so much more vibrant now especially food.",Zeze
14,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 9, 2021",1,I've tried 2 other anti depressants and none of them worked until I tried rexulti. Highly recommend. It gives you a boost to make you do your daily tasks that need to be done.,John doe.
15,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 5, 2021",1,"Hi there, I suffered two major depressive episodes. The last one was recent and I suffered predominantly from emotional lability, zero energy, cognitive and memory issues,… I was given 1 mg Rexulti along with my already daily dose of 450 Wellbutrin. After a handful of weeks I was much better and could return to work (I was off work). I attributed my feeling better to lack of stress while off work and not Rexulti, which made me very hungry/I did gain weight. So I asked to go off of it. I was easing off with .5 mg daily for 14 days. In day 14 I crashed.. emotional lability, cognitive issues… everything came back.. and I had to once again be off work. I tried to continue with .5 but only after I went back to 1 mg and after about 2 weeks of being on 1 mg was I ‘back to normal’. My experience going off of it and the ramifications proved to me that this medication works. I went back to work and continued on as normal. I did gain weight, which was already an issue :(",Glad it worked

19,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,,"April 16, 2021",14,"After a sudden crisis of anxiety and paranoia, very schizophrenic-like, I was admitted through ER to high-security psych ward. Was discharged two weeks later with several anti-psychotic meds that enabled me to go home where I have amazing family support. Struggled for 5.5 years, trying a host of different meds, none of which helped much and many made me feel worse. 6-7 months ago I began Rexulti and after the first 2 weeks on 1mg, noticing improvement, we increased to 2mg and within 2 days I got my mental and emotional game back. My family could not believe the difference. It was no placebo, as we had all but given up on meds being helpful. I have gained 10lbs of belly fat, but the trade-off has been well worth it. I'm far from sure the benefits will last, but it's been wonderful to become functional and more at peace again, so I can continue to identify and address the deeper psychological factors underpinning my challenges here.",Hopeful

At first she said it worked great - couldn’t cry if she tried. About a year ago she started to change - spaced out look on face, moving really slow, no interest in anything - like a different person. We had no idea what was happening and thought maybe her depression was getting worse. But she seemed so different. Then after research realized she had developed NIDS (neuroleptic-induced deficit syndrome). She never even realized she was taking an ANTIPSYCHOTIC! This drug is for schizophrenia - not depression.

Family and friends have commented about how I have become more social and involved in day to day life.  My only complaint is the darned commercial Rexulti has with the stupid mask.

I'm more concerned with hygiene whereas before I was not.  I don't feel as depressed.  I am however, terrified of gaining weight from this medicine.  I'm trying to be very careful.  The worst side effect so far is I am so sleepy all day long.  I have a hard time staying awake.  I find its making me extremely sleepy.  I'm going to give it some time anyway and hope that this is just a side effect that will go away.",1974

It took me almost 2 years & many drugs until I was put on Rexulti, & it has honestly changed my life. I am happy, can take care of my children and most importantly I am not wanting to end my life anymore. I didn’t think a medication could help me. Depression is a very serious disease but there CAN be relief. It may not be Rexulti for you, your body chemistry may react better to something else, but please don’t give up hope and please take your meds as prescribed. For me I was mentally better in less than 1 week, but it can take up to 5. DON’T give up hope! A lot of people who get better don’t bother to go back & write reviews, therefore you see for tons of different meds tons of different bad reviews. I am a 33 year old woman diagnosed with severe severe depression and anxiety. Nothing else on the planet worked for me. Blessings and good luck.",Kay

Up until now it has helped my mood swings, depression, and anxiety. Only recently have I started getting depressed again (I think I finally built up a tolerance), so they're going to up it to 1 mg. This drug has helped me more than any SSRI ever has, with very minimal side effects (gained 25 lbs in one year, mostly due to bad eating habits, which I've since fixed and lost 3 lbs in 2 weeks), but I also went gluten free at the same time I started Rexulti so...???No other side effects at all, it's like I'm taking a sugar pill.

Once off of wellbutrin, the Rexulti is now impacting me side effects I didn't have before. Eye twitching at times, memory loss is bad, feel more depressed than before where I feel zero excitement about new things I should be. Having strained muscles and joints as well. Cognitive thinking skills are extremely blurry where it's impacting being able to work. Not sure what caused this but, will have to go off of it.

I've never had any side effects from it, nor have I gained any weight because of it.

It has helped immensely improved my day to day life with depression which was causing anxiety and other triggers for my mood disorders. I was on lamictal and trileptal before this. I switched entirely to Rexulti 6 weeks ago. Great part of this is quick to help depression. Bad part, tolerance is a bit tricky. Restlessness, digestive, insomnia was horrible when I was on wrong dose. Also, HUNGER is huge. I see why people have gained weight. I don't think it's like SSRIs where it screws w/ your metabolism. It just makes you hungry. Try to get a schedule down for eating and only eat at those times normal amounts of food. This helped me avoid weight gain.Highly recommend.",Lauren

I don't know how long this feeling will last or if it will last indefinitely while on the medication.",andiefaye
191,Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,,"February 27, 2016",73,"As a ""thick file"" patient, after nearly thirty years of suffering through dozens of combinations of drugs for TRMDD, and this little gem has had an impact far exceeding any other treatment.  One milligram Rexulti as an adjunct to 60 mg mirtazapine/200 mg bupropion has given me a chance to move forward.  Reduced dependency on alprazolam, nicotine, ethanol in the first thirty days.  Am hoping fervently that there's not a ""poop-out"" potential with Rexulti, and am making hay while the sun shines.  My psychiatrist is shaking is head, having seen likewise highly significant movement in a good number of long-time treatment resistant patients, because ""on paper, it looks just like Abilify"".  Not placebo effect in my case.",schwarzhund

I stopped it a few days ago and have experienced a slight improvement in those symptoms already. Please use caution when taking this as there is very little information out there about this drug, or how it is affecting actual patients. I will not be taking this drug again.",Kelley716

It started to stop working on me around Christmas time. I felt blank. I have a wonderful psychiatrist who gave me Rexulti. I didn't know if it was psychosomatic at first or not, but I felt better within three days!  My mood lifted. I feel level and normal and often forget to take the Xanax that I used to depend on for my several panic attacks per day. Now I'm weening down my Xanax because that you cannot stop cold turkey. This medication is wonderful. I'm just nervous about long term effects since it is so new.",Andshay

I have battled this for years trying so many different meds, finally found WB worked for me, however I still felt like I had mild depression. I wanted to smile again, laugh again and this med has done that for me. On my 4th day, I laughed and thought, this is working, finally! I was prescribed 0.5 for a week to increase to 1.0 the start of the 2nd week. The first week I felt hyper, energetic, and happy.. I had to call my Dr because I felt if I went up on the dose I would start having panic attacks and anxiety. She told me to stay on the 0.5 and increase if I felt like I needed to. I am still on the low dose. I'm in my 3rd week.",Lafin

I also take 50mg of Vyvanse, and 10mg of Dexedrine, for ADHD. I have tried Abilify and Latuda, and they did nothing for me - no side effects but no positive effects either, just... nothing.
