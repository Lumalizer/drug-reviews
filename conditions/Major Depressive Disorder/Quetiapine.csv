1,Quetiapine,Major Depressive Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 13, 2021",3,"I took this years ago. I don't remember the dose but it was enough to destroy my life. I was told to take it at night after dinner. I did that and in 30 minutes  it felt like I hadn't eaten all day and I ate a lot before taking it. I would then eat again because I was so relaxed. I tripled my weight my Dr. solution was to monitor  my glucose!! Unbelievable! I was always a thin girl. The fat caused me even greater depression which didn't seem to worry the doctor. I wanted to warn others as I was too depressed and uninformed about weight gain and meds. If you are gaining weight especially a lot, it is not working. Maybe a lower dose would be the answer, as it did quiet the mind.",Lil

4,Quetiapine,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 1, 2021",1,I have been struggling with my depression and in particular not sleeping well (I wasn't exactly an insomniac but it did take hours for me to fall asleep and when I did I hardly ever reached REM or deep sleep so I would always wake up exhausted no matter how much I slept) and have been struggling with antidepressant.  Taking this along side my antidepressant immediately from night 1 was a big improvement. I since I already an on another antidepressant I use at night only so I can have a good sleep. I couldn't take it during the day it made me too drowsy. I'm only taking 25mg for now I plan to stick to it since I read your body becomes over reliant on it. I'd hope to eventually come off it and not needs it to sleep. The only downside is that it makes me hungry so I have to resist getting up at night to snack. But overall it's working for me,Kentucky
5,Quetiapine,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 12, 2021",2,This medication gave me a condition called bradycardia were it made my heart rate drop very low.

6,Quetiapine,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 1, 2021",8,"I've been on every SSRI available in the past 40 years. None of them helped in the slightest. I was prescribed 100mg quetiapine at night, but I only took 50mg because that was enough to knock me out. My doctor told me to take 100mg so I did. After a week, I felt like a different person! No longer as emotional but very logical. The down side is that I did develop the rare side effect of diabetes 2. However, the db2 is managed well with metformin and quetiapine works so well for me that the benefits outweigh the risk. It's also the best sleeping aid I've ever taken.So, if you start taking it, know the symptoms of high blood sugar so you can get it treated asap.",Good Stuff

8,Quetiapine,Major Depressive Disorder,,,"May 2, 2020",13,"First let me say to all of you that have depression, it will get better. Im not saying that seroquel will be the right drug for you but there is one out there that will help. Always remember depression medication is always "" a trial and error"" EVERYONE is different with the way their body responds to certain medication. For instance, prozac could work great for some people but make other people worse. I can speak a lot on depression. I have MMBD It started 13 years ago l..I have took some that worked great, some that didn't work at all and some that worked for a while and stopped. One thing I can tell you is that taking a antidepressant for people with MBD an NOT taking a mood stabilizer most the time will cause an increase in manic episodes. Especially with the drug prozac. Personally as of now I take celexa, lamictal ""generics"" and they work great together for me. I will now start seroquel to help with a few manic episodes that I have recently had.",Red
9,Quetiapine,Major Depressive Disorder,4.0,,"March 23, 2020",17,"I have mixed feelings on quetiapine. I take 25mg of it along with 100mg of sertraline for major depression. It does somewhat help with the sleep disturbances.  In the way that if I take it on time, it helps me go to bed at a reasonable time, and I fall asleep in a flash once it ''kicks in''. Thing is, I am now absolutely unable to fall asleep without taking it. I never had a problem with falling asleep before I started taking medication, the problem was that I slept too long, 10-13 hours a day. My quality of sleep on quetiapine is miserable. I wake up several times in the night, and falling asleep after is very difficult, sometimes impossible. I can't sleep anytime else. As a result, I'm tired all the time because I can't catch up on sleep, with naps for example. I guess I have to pay this price in exchange for the pills preventing me from killing myself, but sleeping terribly hasn't really been helping my mood all that much.",Kanra

I was agitated and pacing, wanting these horrendous feelings to stop. I sat down stood up I wanted to lie there and then. I didn't know what to do. Just over 2 Hours later it suddenly stopped and I felt ok. I don't know how I'm going to get through it again tonight.Apart from that I slept well and feel more relaxed.My mouth is like sandpaper and tastes metallic but it's a small price to pay for feeling better.

I was so tired from feeling LOW everyday, I thought there was no way I would ever regain will to live. Dr. rx’d me Seroquel 25mg once at bedtime so at least I wasn’t thinking about ending my life anymore. Suddenly I felt really heavy-drunk and could barely walk. The first day I slept for 20hr and when I woke up I was too tired to keep up my previous behaviour. After a couple days I whittled 20hr down to 8 and was sleeping normally. 6 months later I am at 100mg and 6 month away from that I am now on XR 200mg. Never have I felt better about my life. This is a tranquilizer. If you expect to drive cars/operate machines, you are seriously mistaken. It should not be taken in the morning due to its sedating effects. If you are someone who doesn’t need to dull your brain, I highly suggest you ask your doctor for another medication. There’s a reason it’s dubbed the shut-up-drug.",lavenderbunni

Prozac, Zoloft, Effexor.Side effects seem to be minor except it does make me sleep a lot. A LOT. up to 10 hours a day. Deep sleep not just REM sleep. Works extremely well for me. Although I  try to use it only when I need it. In short periods of 2 weeks or so and then see if I still require it. Very effective.

For the last 15 years I have been on 400mg Quetiapine for Major Depressive Disorder.  I am so grateful that I found the right doctor who knew how to help me. This medication has made me feel normal again.  I do take it at night as it it puts me totally asleep within 30 to 60 min.  Another benefit for me as I have always had trouble falling asleep. I hope I never have to be taken off this medicine.  I know it is not suggested for older adults with signs of dementia so praying I do not have that in my later years.  I really think that this medication should only be prescribed to be taken at night because of the sedative effects of it for most people. Thank you to whomever created this medication.",Girly
14,Quetiapine,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 12, 2019",18,"I’ve been on quetiapine since I was 13 for major depression and anxiety. I was off of it for a brief period of less than a year when I was 19, and completely decompensated. As soon as it was restarted, within a matter of days I was already feeling like myself again. While I’m not a fan of the increased appetite (and therefore weight gain), as well as the increased sedation, I feel like a normal person when I’m on it. I’m 21 now and able to excel through college because of this medication. I can’t express how grateful I am for it. If you deal with those same side effects, I recommend asking your doctor about adding a low dose of vyvanse to your morning medications. It decreases appetite and wakes you up a bit, getting you out of that sedative head fog. Just my two cents. :-)",Tiktak

Quetiapine has given me my life back.  I sleep again, almost no negative thoughts, very little anxiety.  The only reason I don't give it a 10 is it is sedating, but for peace of mine that's a small price to pay.",BJ
16,Quetiapine,Major Depressive Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 23, 2019",8,"I was placed on 400mg of Seroquel instant release for psychotic depression. It helped a lot with hallucinations, delusions, negative thoughts, and more. It normalized me. It let me sleep. Its sedation was definitely strong. However, it made me into a zombie with all of the brain fog. My grades in school were awful because I could hardly even think. I was always sleepy and passing out. I would often sleep for 20+ hours sometimes. The sedation is not reliable at all because I am not always sleepy after taking it. It works extremely well but it is not a good drug to take if you are a student or work a lot. It is far too sedating. I have not had any other bad side effects from it aside from stiffness. I have not gained any weight on it.",Apple
17,Quetiapine,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,,"September 11, 2019",21,"This drug quetiapine has quite literally saved my life. I have always been suicidal, depressed, anxious, impulsive and angry. Since taking 25mg at night, I feel like my depression and suicidal thoughts are completely gone, my moods are happier, I no longer think about killing myself 100 times a day, I'm no longer a negative thinker, I no longer just want to sleep all day, I have been 100% more pro-active with my life, am no longer anxious in public, no longer impulsive or angry, I feel mentally healthy for the first time in my entire life and am actively working on creating a life for myself that will make me happy. I have now been on Seroquel for 4 months and it's going to be difficult to get another script and it's extremely disheartening that when finally I've found something that has actually helped me, (SSRI's made me worse) doctors don't think that all that I've mentioned is a good enough reason to stay on it.",afb

Had suicidal thoughts before starting this and they got worse after about 3 weeks, so had to go inpatient. Things became ok after another couple of weeks inpatient. Now taking 50mg in the morning, 50mg after lunch and 200mg at night, along with 20mg lexapro in the morning.RLS was a problem earlier, before upping to 300mg total. But now it is rare and mild.Another side effect I now suspect caused by this drug is these awfully depressing and painful dreams.It helps coping with some emotions I would rather not deal with. It makes the mind clearer and quieter, dampening emotions too strong and painful.

I used to drink a little (2-3 drinks) after I turned 21 and perhaps this might have exacerbated the problem. I am now 29, have gotten off of this medication but still fall asleep randomly.

I find it interesting that people are prescribed this antipsychotic for insomnia as it isn't licenced for such use and research clearly indicates that the side effect profile far outweighs the benefits when used as a sleep aid. I take quetiapine as a mood stabilizer so only time will tell on its efficacy however it has made me feel calmer so far and side effects have been minimal,Richie

23,Quetiapine,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,,"March 24, 2019",11,"Abilify, Prozac and Lamictal did not work. Zoloft worked, but after a stop/start I had a manic episode. Former doctor suggested quetiapine to calm my thoughts and help me sleep. Was on 150mg of an extended release dosage, 200mg at the highest. While this helped some, I slept far too much. There also is the problem of weight gain, and after I stopped taking it, it took me a while to be able to fall asleep normally; this corrected itself after a week or two. However, my depression and anxiety resurfaced and I went to a generic dose of 150mg. This moves through my system faster, but I can still sleep for a long period of time. Today, I'm on 100mg of quetiapine at night and 100mg of bupropion during the day. I'm currently visiting a psychiatrist, who believes that the root of my depression/anxiety is sleep apnea. Currently being evaluated for that. Quetiapine works for me. Will correct my diet and hopefully I will lose some weight soon. :) God bless.",SnowyAshton
24,Quetiapine,Major Depressive Disorder,2.0,,"January 25, 2019",7,"My doctor prescribed this to me after my depression and anxiety started getting worse and I found myself actually getting very angry and combative (which is odd because I never used to be an angry person)I've take this for a few months and I can honestly say this was the worst medication I've taken for my depression/anxiety. There was way more negatives than positives for this medication for me.First off my face broke out in acne, which isn't normal for me.Secondly, it increases your appetite majorly, which may not be a problem to some but I have a binge eating disorder so that clearly isn't very good and I just instantly started gaining weight.And the worst one of them all was it made me WAY more angry and mad.

27,Quetiapine,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,,"August 5, 2018",22,"I went through some traumatic events that left me unbearably anxious and depressed. I had constant suicidal thoughts partly from my situation and partly because the anxiety and depression was so severe that I just wanted it to end. I ended up not sleeping for a week and entered a psychotic state. I attempted suicide and was taken to a hospital. I was put on several drugs which did not help. Only benzos helped me calm down but that is only a short term solution. I left the hospital still suicidal. I finally met with my psychiatrist who suggested seroquel and it was my MIRACLE drug. I truly believe it saved my life. After a few sleepy nights on it I began waking up feeling stable, confident and ready to face my problems logically and without panic or anxiety. Some people have bad effects but the mental clarity and strength it gave me outweigh the negatives. I don't mind gaining some lbs if it keeps me from wanting to kill and injure myself.",wheelsmcgee

It should stop the RLS altogether, and is likely safer than an NSAID for pain (check with your Dr. of course).

Expensive, ineffective, grossly negative side effects to skin and, chronic fatique daily. Trying another high cost drug a desperate last resort. Each dirty little pill failed, with accumulated cost of more than $15,000 to the  patient asking for help Negligent dispensation of Seroquel XR also resulted in near fatal car wreck for the patient. Aside from losing my car, and job, I was priveleged to gain 40 pounds, .... and counting. Chronic insomnia kills drivers, truckers, pilots, boat captains every day.

I am fed up with the weight gain and feeling tired all the time my physciatrist is eventually taking me off this and wants to try venlafaxine I dont know if that will help with my depression but I will give it a go I also take 45mg mirtazapine at night which also helps me sleep.

My depression has only worsened since (and before) my initial diagnosis of depression and generalized, social and ""acute"" anxiety 13 years ago. I've been in a major depression for at least five years, tried to kill myself twice and am unable to take care of myself. I've lived alone since I left for college in 2003. I still live alone here. I've been on any SSRI I can think of, so this was a last resort  med. Seroquel has made me much too tired to work or do anything else. The only stars I gave it relate to the reduced anxiety when I'm ACTUALLY AWAKE. Other than that, I'm more numb than I ever and are at risk of losing my job",Might be done

It also is to help my anxiety disorder. I've noticed that I am less depressed and anxious, But that's only because I'm so depersonalised I can't focus on my surroundings, Let alone my anxietyI constantly feel stuck in a dream-like state and I can't focus. Even as I write this I'm struggling to find the words,and describe how I feel, Because I don't feel much of anything I haven't had many other side effects, even when I drastically increased the dose All in all, It technically does help, But this is no way to live",Haley_1182
46,Quetiapine,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 22, 2015",30,Seroquel XR (quetiapine):Absolutely amazing drug. Has quite literally saved my life. Pity I need to lie to the Australian government about having bipolar to get it prescribed. No doubt this is stopping many thousands of Australians from getting access to it. Seriously. I went from suicidal for severalmonths to absolutely normal in one dose. One dose. Talk to your doctor about this if anti depressants are not working for you. Understand it may require you to lie about having bipolar.,BelindaAUS
47,Quetiapine,Major Depressive Disorder,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 20, 2015",8,I went from 50-300 mg in two weeks. I gained ten pounds and was constantly tired all the time. I usually stay between the same weight to a pound up or down. I took the extended release tablets (xr)As soon as I took the medicine within an hour I became very tired to the point where I would start to mumble and fall asleep. This medicine made me feel like I was out of it all the time. Not to mention I fainted a couple of times and I've never fainted in my life. I think I was on too high of a level for my body. I'm not trying to scare anyone with my review I'm just sharing my experience with the medicine I know everyone's body is different. This medicine made me sleep 24/7 and relaxed me.,80s
48,Quetiapine,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 14, 2015",7,"This medicine has been an excellent tranquilizer. It seems to stop whatever negative thoughts I'm having, and flattens my mood.  It has a half-life of only 6-8 hours! I would recommend it for sleep, and episodes of severe mental illness, be it MDD, PTSD, etc..Note: as a drug to be on all day, this should not be first line. It causes a lot of drowsiness and feelings of being drugged. Being on it a short time, through sleep or a bad episode, can dramatically improve your day.",Steve Stevenson

I had a change of Doctors, due to the fact that my Doctor left this practice. Not sure the reason for this medication. Never Again!!  After starting that medication once it really got in my system, my worst fear came to reality. I totally went outside my mind to the point my daughter was so scared of my behavior she called the EMS.

Head spins and just like motion sickness. But I was advised to stick it out and did. Approx 6 weeks it settled down. I take it for BiPolar, the racing mind, no sleep or little sleep. With Seroquel, I sleep a nights rest. My mind isn't active at all. I'm on 300mg. A bit tired of a morning, but if you are up early, which can be hard, the effects wear off, sooner. I won't swap to any other, I tried Zyprexa but, I'm sticking with Seroquel.",Eliza_nsw
