0,Viibryd,Major Depressive Disorder,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 23, 2022",0,"The side effects I experienced while taking Viibryd overwhelmed the benefits. Six months prior to trying Viibryd I had been on 150mg of Effexor for two years, but its effectiveness plateaued and the GI issues I had, made it no longer a good fit. I started on 10mg of Viibryd for three weeks and initially,I felt more energized, less agitated and slightly more upbeat along with intestinal distress, headaches and insomnia, which I expected for a short period. After three weeks, both the benefits and side effects waned, so I titrated up to 20mg with stronger side effects plus anxiety which started to increase as the medicine started to build up in my system. I had a non-stop headache, ridiculous insomnia and worsening anxiety. I became so exhausted from never sleeping and disappointingly my depressive symptoms did not improve. I stopped taking Viibryd a week ago, but I continue to have insomnia and intestinal discomfort.",Hannah821

I’m going to be completely honest with you it didn’t change anything at all.

Not Viibryd! I feel amazing on this medication, a life I've always wanted to live feels possible because of it. I've been on it for almost 2 years now and cannot tell you the turn around in my life. From suicidal and hopeless and now I am happy, motivated, and positive. I hope to what ever higher power exists that it never stops working for me and I can always afford it.",Applegir44

I was put on viibryd 2 years ago and my life is normal again.  Insurance quit covering it and the price sky rocketed so I switched to Trintellix.  Within 2 weeks I couldn't move or find any motivation.  After 2 months I went back to viibryd and am back to my normal self again.

I've been reading that this is a ""duplicate therapy"" meaning both drugs have almost identical side effects. I have HORRIBLE INSOMNIA & a lot of anger. I was on Wellbutrin years ago & never any problems. I believe discontinuing the Viibryd 10mg all together would be best. I felt a slight boost in my behavior during the first week & thats it.

6,Viibryd,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 27, 2021",2,"I have been on a total of 10 antidepressants throughout my life. Viibryd is amazing and the only med that really helps me. It keeps me level and my depression at bay. If I miss a pill I am depressed the next day. The 40 MG pill really upset my stomach everyday. So the Dr dropped me down to 20 MG. At one point I was struggling so he told me to take 40 MG until I was better. I took two 20 MG pills did not hurt my stomach. So I'm not sure what the difference is in the pills.If I miss a dose, when I start back I also get a headache and upset stomach for 1 day. It does get rid of my sex drive. I don't even really ever think about it anymore. But the pay off of not struggling mentally is completely worth it. It is SUPER  expensive even with insurance. So my Dr sends them a note letting them know I have tried 9 other meds so this one is medically necessary. So insurance pays for it completely.",Angel
7,Viibryd,Major Depressive Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 16, 2021",3,I don't have a lot of experience with trying different meds. The first one I tried made me extremely tired which was kind of nice because my mind was quiet. Viibryd is nice because I have energy and I feel stable as in the same for many months with no depressive episodes. Sometimes I get annoyed that my thoughts are just bouncing around my head with no purpose. Especially when I'm trying to sleep and I'm thinking about all kinds of weird things. They used to be repetitive and somewhat destructive but at least they seemed to have a purpose. During the day I don't notice it because I'm busy but when I'm sleeping I have weird thoughts and weird dreams. They aren't bad or anything just weird.,Monstar.

I began a worry loop about losing my job, my brain started replaying ever interaction I had with other humans and starting feeling paranoid.  By day 3 I was felt like screaming and running down the street.  I've never had a reaction like this.  The mental worry-loop it induced was terrifying.  Day 4 was worse.

I have taken many different depression/anxiety meds as well as trying a couple mood stabilizers. Nothing has helped long term. I realized that most of these meds either don't change my depressive state or I become very depressed, lash out and I'm suicidal. I haven't been on anything for about 6 month. Seeing a new Dr and he suggested we try Viibryd and gave me a sample. WHAT A MISTAKE!!! I felt good the first day, then started becoming sad. Ended up lashing out at my husband and teen age kids by the evening of day 4 day 5 was a nightmare day. Anger, depression, wanted to just leave my family and felt very suicidal and self harming. I was not able to work the following day. I stopped immoderately. Although I am still agitated I feel like today I could cry at the drop of the hat but I'm not wanting to lash out or suicidal.

I was too depressed to get out of bed and I felt like I couldn’t get a full breath. A friend told me about her doctor and the magic pill, obviously I wasn’t believing that there was such a thing but I made an appointment anyway, it couldn’t get any worse! At my appointment the doctor gave me trial pack that contained 10 mg and 25 mg, she said to start at 10 and then take the 25. I asked what they were and was told antidepressants. My heart hit the floor and I felt like I was going to cry. Over my life I had tried several types of antidepressants that only made me feel worse. I left my appointment and just forgot about the pills. One day about a week later I was feeling so bad that I decided to try half of a 10mg. Within 30-40 minutes I started feeling better, a lot better!!! Long story short It saved my life. I haven’t had real depression since that day, for me it was a magic pill!!",Mich flm

Unfortunately for me though… I think I have depression breakthrough. I had my second child two and a half months ago. And the last few days I started feeling depressed again with crying spells, irritability, anger you name it. My doctor is having me take half a pill extra to see if it helps but to no avail so far.

Tried Trintellix, Cymbalta for 6 months and was always falling asleep at my desk and absolutely knocked-out all libido. Did a cross-switch to Viibryd which is the best med so far. It's an SSRI, but it uses a different pathway, and I feel like myself again. Since there's no generic, it is expensive, but worth every penny. Libido is back! No more ED or need for Viagra at 65 years old. That certainly helps to feel ""whole"" again. Did the cross-switch from Cymbalta to Viibryd and it wasn't very difficult by slowly decreasing Cymbalta and gradually increasing Viibryd. Went from 10-20-30 with no problem. Just started 40mg which is recommended dose. Also, 25mg of Staterra was added for concentration (ADHD). Feeling great - results excellent.",Bob_FL
22,Viibryd,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,,"April 16, 2021",57,"I’ve been through countless medications - I have anxiety, panic attacks, mdd. They all made me sick, more anxious, panic attacks that felt like heart attacks, have aggressive behavior, bouts of OCD, RLS, feel like I was walking in a fog, etc. Viibryd has been tolerable. I don’t feel as depressed and overwhelmed to the point of feeling paralyzed. Only side effect is vivid nightmares, and really not helping with my anxiety/panic attacks. As long as I am still prescribed my Xanax, my whole life feels so much better. The Xanax helps with the panic and anxiety, but the depression was always lingering and interfering with my day to day life, and viibryd is taking care of that.

After 1.5 weeks I've decided that Viibryd is not going to work for me either. It seemed to help with my depression, but it screwed up my sleep sooo much! About 3-4 hours after I'd take it, I'd be hit with this super drowsy/sleepy feeling and would start dosing off (even at work! Not ok). Some days, if I was able to, I'd just take a 2 hour nap when the sleepiness hit. But once that passed I'd feel fine and awake again. Until I had to go to bed... The insomnia I experienced with Viibryd was no joke! I had to call in sick to work because I could not fall asleep, no matter what I did. And I knew I couldn't function at work on zero sleep.

39,Viibryd,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 31, 2020",105,"Well, Viibryd. What to say, from looking at the general response it either works amazingly or the side effects can be debilitating. As for my experience? This has been a wonderful drug. I have not had gene sight testing (I wish I had) but have gone through the general ringer with the old fashioned trial and error. No other SSRI/SNRI/DNRI/TCA has worked for me but Viibryd has! I totally disagree that 20mg is the optimal dose it’s all subjective, 20mg worked for me for 3 weeks then completely pooped out. Now up to 40mg and two days in and I feel great. So if it makes stops working and you feel it had worked prior, do not be afraid to increase after talking to your DR vs stop taking. But yes there are side effects- diarrhea (which went away) &  headaches , increased RLS being the mainstay but tolerable. And my sex life has greatly improved on this drug.

I'm supposed to take it for another month and if it still doesn't help then I get to taper off. I accidentally missed a dose and felt miserable. I had no energy, and felt like electric shocks were popping my brain cells. I still have anxiety and feel like this medication gave me depression.",Salsberry

One of my main concerns was the loss of sexual arousal. I'm in my early 20s and that scared me a little. I was informed Viibryd doesn't reduce your sexual arousal as much as others do. My Psychiatrist did tell me this medicine is more expensive than other anti depressants right off the bat, even with my parents insurance plan.I'd say one side effect of this medicine for me is that I need to take it every day. I notice a crash effect if I miss a day or take it later than I usually do in the morning. For some reason the 30MG tablets were more expensive than the 40MG tablets.",KalRock14

As far as side effects, I get an upset stomach if I don't eat before I take it. I took it right before bed one time and had a really vivid nightmare, so I try to take it early in the day. When I do miss a dose, I feel withdrawal more than I did with Prozac. Overall, it's effective for me, but I have to be more careful to avoid side effects.",NymeriaSnow
