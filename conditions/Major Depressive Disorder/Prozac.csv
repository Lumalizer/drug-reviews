0,Prozac,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 11, 2022",1,I took Prozac for Major Depressive Disorder. I would definitely say I was severely depressed and had suicidal ideation. Also some nights could not sleep and the nights I could sleep would only sleep a couple of hours. I went to see a psychiatrist (something I always recommend for mental disorders. I do not recommend a General Practitioner) and he prescribed Prozac for depression and Seroquel for my insomnia. I’m not gonna lie nothing changed much for about 3 1/2 weeks but on day 24 of taking those meds it’s as if there was a complete and total change for the good. I say all of that because you gotta hang in there as it takes a while for meds to kick in. I have been on these meds for over 5 months and I will follow my psychiatrist’s instructions. I feel great. I am thankful to God for my psychiatrist and these meds. Oh and I take 40mg of Prozac and 200 mg of seroquel per day.,Gabe
1,Prozac,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,,"February 10, 2022",1,It worked the first year taking two 20mg tabs at night and then one 20mg tab at lunch then I developed a routine where I couldn't sleep at night so we had to change it to two 20mg tablets in morning and one at  dinner after about 6 months I started sleeping in the day time and was able to sleep thru the night also. So I was sleeping about 17 hours a day after three weeks I called Dr. And we made a switch and been switching about every two months next visit I'm going to see if we can't try the Prozac at a lower dose maybe 20mg twice a day,Anonymous

4,Prozac,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 15, 2021",1,"I've only been taking Prozac for a week, but I'm really cautiously optimistic and today I feel pretty good. I haven't been able to say that for a long time. I took it almost 20 years ago for a time but didn't like it. I decided to try it again because I'm increasingly having treatment-resistant depression. I have tried MANY antidepressants. Some don't affect me at all and some give me extreme muscle spasms. But this doesn't seem to have any bad side effects. Again, cautiously optimistic!",enska

6,Prozac,Major Depressive Disorder,9.0,,"May 14, 2021",35,"I have SAD, GAD, PTSD, and major depressive disorder in a bipolar spectrum. I suffered from random depressive episodes, PMDD, irritability, crying randomly, suicidal thoughts, social isolation, insomnia, etc.  I was on 100mg of zoloft once and it did absolutely nothing to me, so I became discouraged from taking meds for 8 years as I felt hopeless. However, during 2020 my depression got so crippling. I reached out and was prescribed this medication. The first week or two, I was really depressed.  However, I've been on it for 3 months now and have not had a single random depressive episode. In addition, I no longer experience PMS. I do have side effects: worsened hand tremors, constipation, and a hard time orgasming. Despite these, it is still very worth it to me after going through what I did.I know you're reading these reviews and it is scary and you feel hopeless, but I want you to know that you should give it a go.",Cj1994
7,Prozac,Major Depressive Disorder,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 18, 2021",5,"This has been a roller coaster of a year and I’m glad I’m going to stop taking Prozac for multiple reason. Prozac helped with my mood, but I still have bad days. The major reasons are fatigue/low energy, anti-social, and irritability. I can’t believe I’ve been taking it for a year because it has caused major problems in my life. Obviously it works or it doesn’t. This medication was a nightmare for me.",Meech

9,Prozac,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 3, 2021",6,"Was going through nasty divorce...insomnia hit, sleeping 5hrs & slumped into bad depression. I think breakdown followed. Went on Prozac due consensus was easiest drug to come off. Mindful of withdrawal & after bad time w/ Paxil 20 years ago, took 15 mg/day in liquid form. Liquid would allow me to taper when ready. 1st month was tough - severely stressed & offered beta blocker by doctor. Turned it down, which was right thing - in time (2-3 months) & as divorce progressed, started to recover. Was on 15mg 9 months before tapering..very slowly - 1mg at a time I would only take next step when felt ready. Then covid came making it more difficult but 2 years on am off fully.  I sleep well & feel pretty good, few tips of my own: 1) try avoid >20 mg/day (tougher to withdraw), 2) take liquid - easier to taper, 3) eat well, exercise & do everything that will help withdrawal (don’t drink more than small amount..stops it working), 4) w/ discipline & will power you can do it! Mood might waver at times tho!",Jim

13,Prozac,Major Depressive Disorder,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 27, 2020",24,"I have been taking Prozac now for 4 years. I started out on 20 mg. After a few months, the doctor upped it to 40 mg. A few days ago, the Prozac was upped to 60 mg. Since being on the 60 mg, I have been feeling slightly nauseated. I'm hoping it will subside soon. Not sure why I never had difficulties on the 40 or 20 mg.Did I gain weight? Yes, but it was pretty much my fault as I ate all the wrong foods and never moved around much. I changed to whole foods, ditched the sugars and carbs and have lost 40 pounds from July until now.I see people say don't take Prozac. My thoughts are that their experiences are not my experiences. Before the Prozac and Sertraline, I had very bad mood swings and lashed out at people. I also have major depression as well as PTSD. The Prozac has been keeping me from lashing out to others. I would much rather keep myself calmer than to attack others.",Penny

It's only a mood stabiliser to stop 'bad thoughts' no low moments, no high moments. Just walking through life like a zombie. Doubled my dose and for a week I felt productive then my tolerance caught up. Quitting was the best decision I made. I feel happier and my 'brain fog' is clearing.

19,Prozac,Major Depressive Disorder,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 4, 2020",32,"Prozac is the best anti-depressant I’ve been on. It worked really well for 6 months and then it started to stop working (I wasn’t very consistent in taking my pills). I had very little side effects. The first month of being on it is very nice. It lets you feel happiness after not being able to. I’ve been off it since August and have not felt the need to start any meds again until recently. Prozac helped me be able to gain that sort of control. It’s okay to depend on medications for awhile or for a lifetime, whatever works for you.",JaneDoe

24,Prozac,Major Depressive Disorder,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 22, 2019",18,"I've been  on prozac medication  for going on a week for anxiety and depression. So far the side effects are really kicking me. I’ve been going thru nightmare these past of couple of days but like all meds I know you have to experiment with yourself and go thru it for a bit to finally understand. I used to take Effexor for depression and it was the same the 1st few weeks until I finally felt some benefits. After I year break from meds I decided to get back on meds since my depression was coming back. But this time my doctor recommended prozac. Due to experience I knew the 1st few weeks I was going to suffer until my mind and body adjust to the meds. It’s always like this for SSRIs meds and it sucks. But everybody is different with each med. I will try to push my way to at least 2 weeks and see if I can manage. I’ll keep updating to see if I made it, if not then I’ll discontinue this med. Hopefully this gives great benefits soon.",Frank.A
25,Prozac,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 9, 2019",22,"27year old male. Had anxiety and depression since 12. The anxiety became more prevalent in my 20’s. Things came to a head as stressors in my life did too. Doctors put me on 20mg Prozac and I sworn that an hour later I felt sweats, light sensitivity and so disoriented. Things got worse from there. Then I wouldn’t take it and feel great, like myself again and then the doctors started telling me I’m bipolar. I had to trust my gut as felt the Prozac was the variable taking my anxiety to the next level and making me feel like I was absolutely losing my mind. I stopped taking it and haven’t looked back. I have been feeling so much more like my self on no meds and talking to therapists. This drug did the opposite to what it was suppose to do to my psyche and I’m so happy I didn’t allow them to put me on all the other meds they wanted to once they started calling me bipolar. This was my experience with this drug and I’m an individual, so take everything with a grain of salt.",Thunder12

From 14-22 years old I tried so many different medications and none of them worked so for several years I didn't take anything at all. Prozac is the first medication I've been on in 5 years. I started at 10mg. For the first three weeks I was amazed at how good I felt, not anxious at all and really no obsessive/intrusive thoughts, and then the scales started to tip. I've spent a month feeling like I'm going absolutely out of my mind, the depression and anxiety and obsessive behaviors have been ramped up times 1000%. I can't remember the last time I've been this suicidal. I went to the doctor and she immediately took me off of it. Let's hope the withdrawal isn't too bad.

Shaky, brain felt wired, nauseous, made it difficult to sleep, and the last 4 days on this I was severely depressed and feeling suicidal which is what led me to stop taking it. At that point I felt like I was on it long enough to be getting some benefits, but I felt worse than before. I had success for many years on Paxil (paroxetine), unfortunately it stopped working for me and I was at the highest dose. I also suffer from anxiety. Fluoxetine actually felt like poison to my body, even though it was supposed to be okay according to my Genesight test results. Very dissapointed.",Nadethi

By the time of my diagnosis, I had mental breakdowns every night, was completely withdrawn from all friends and family, and my grades went from straight A’s to straight D’s. I was tired, numb, and sick. I tried to kill myself twice.Then I started Prozac at 10mg and then up to 40 mg. Three years later, I was finally able to get my life back together. It takes several months for Prozac to take effect. For me, it was an entire year. For sure it’s no miracle cure, but I was less empty and less tired. Prozac is not a happy pill. It won’t fix your problems. It won’t make life seem infinitely better. It won’t undo the damage. Nothing will. It will only give you the opportunity to make everything better again.

I'm not sure to say it was for major depressive disorder, but  I was just waking up and seeing the world in a way with no feeling. I had depression when I was young, and continued. Prozac has been up and downed in the dose. But I currently take 80 mg, and I have to say it helps with feeling better, wellbutrin was more stimulating but much anxiety, other serotonin antidepressants somewhat worked, but Prozac is the one I keep using because it worked. Prozac just simply help my mood, I could be in the mood to talk. When it's not taken or if I miss one or 2 days, I can tell, mentally sluggish, the depression of not feeling anything. Prozac makes me less apathetic, and I'm in a better mood. Some people have an opposite reaction, and have flat feeling.

I am also taking Navalpro 300mg, twice a day. Prozac is the only meds that has made me function as a ""normal"" person after being correctly diagnosed as having major depression. When I 1st desperately looked for help, my anxiety was unbearable. Prozac killed 2 birds with 1 stone-depression & anxiety. I had a rollercoaster journey, being prescribed other antidepressants together with Prozac. I have come to accept that the benefits outweigh the side effects.

After the near-suicide because of Effexor, I asked if we could just stick with Prozac but increase the dose. I prefer it because I feel like ME, not some drugged-out, flattened-emotion version of me.
