0,Bupropion,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 16, 2022",3,Wellbutrin (bupropion):Wellbutrin or Bupropion is by far the best medicine I've taken for relieving depression.  It takes time on this med so don't give up too soon.  I have been on 300mg for 6 months and I am seeing results that I never saw with other antidepressants and I have taken most of them at one time or other. Every antidepressant I've taken in the past caused me such apathy I can't function. I now have pleasant or even joyous thoughts occasionally and I am getting interested in life again.,GrNana
1,Bupropion,Major Depressive Disorder,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 10, 2022",0,"I had a pretty bad experience with bupropion XL. I took 150mg daily for 2-3 months, and it made me tired and foggy. I was very unmotivated and depressed, even while taking it alongside 50mg of sertraline. A few months later I was on Desvenlafaxine XL 150mg, and decided to give bupropion a second chance. I added it, and instantly felt worse, like the time before, but much worse. Had pretty bad suicidal ideations. Only was on it for 10 days or so, but I certainly won't ever be going back on it. This is not to dissuade you from trying it, everyone is different, but just keep in mind these side effects if you are going to be starting treatment.",Joe Kwartin
2,Bupropion,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 7, 2022",3,Wellbutrin XL (bupropion):I have been on this med for about 7 months (150mg). Initially made me feel great with little side effects and it still does.  I smoked weed for about 4 of those 7 months until I quit cold turkey 2 months ago. I think the weed negated the rise in anxiety that wellbutrin usually gives.  Wellbutrin is known to increase anxiety so be weary but it can wear off in a couple of weeks to months. For me I take it with Clonazepam as needed but I take it daily almost because of the constant anxiety. For me I am not addicted cause I am on such a low dose (1mg) but I would like to try Buspar which I prob will. This pill gave me my motivation back that I lost for about 6 years. It allows me to get out of bed and not feel pity or sorry for myself. I usually take it in the mornings. BUT if you have GAD be weary as it can make your anxiety worse. But the way it makes you feel motivated can outweigh the crazy anxiety it can give.,nat
3,Bupropion,Major Depressive Disorder,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2022",0,"Budeprion XL (bupropion):I was on bupropion for 4 months. It was somewhat effective for my MDD, and helped some aspects of my ADHD a little bit (primarily ones associated with depression, like overeating and motivation). Side-effects when starting were quite intense, and I noticed slight increases in suicidal ideation. I got off of it because of concerns of other medications interacting, and cross-tapered to Zoloft (which I found totally ineffective and potentially made things worse). Side effects were the most problematic aspect of Budeprion.",ianmacaig

The side effects though within just the first two weeks were awful. I had dealt with many medications side effects before, but with this, I could not stop shaking and my heart was constantly racing (120+ bpm constantly). I was throwing up, yet also not hungry at all.

8,Bupropion,Major Depressive Disorder,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 1, 2022",0,"I was on bupropion for a couple months with some issues with dosing and changes to the SR version and then back. I had immediate energy and motivation, but shakes for about three weeks and a constant fast heartbeat/palpitations. After a couple weeks on it at 150mg I had a random day where my chest felt so tight and my heartbeat was so fast I couldn't breathe, like a panic attack. My doctor added buspar 5mg and told me to take it up to three times a day, but ideally only once at night. I had to take it three times, otherwise my chest felt tight at around noon. The buspar made me sleepy and counteracted the energy boosting of the bupropion, but I didn't want to up the bupropion dosage because I was worried the chest tightening would get worse. From the reviews I've seen, it looks like brand name Wellbutrin likely would not induce the side effects that made this drug unusable for me, but insurance did not cover the brand name. It's sad. I felt great on it, aside from the side effects.",123456

I’ve had my ups and downs ( mainly down nowadays) and I found myself always tired, no energy, was an avid gym rat. I’m 57. I take meds on and off mainly off for years but I was at a point where I openly spoke about not being here, setting up wife in the event.  I don’t leave the house unless I go food shopping or run errands.  I just completed one week of this med. After searching online for a day by day or week by week diary of expectations I decided to write my 1 week completion of Bupropion XL. IMHO do NOT take at nite. My first week was headaches all day, sleepy but can’t nap. I feel sleep deprived not rested. I get spurts of energy and then stop. Be your own advocate. Research meds not opinions on what to take.

After being lonely, having too much time to think, and being unhappy making minimum wage, I stumbled into depression. I eventually decided to try bupropion. It made me feel great during weeks 3 and 4, but at the beginning of week 5, my mood dropped. I'm still on week 5, and the good news is that I almost feel normal. I feel only slightly depressed, and I'm able to shut negative thoughts down easily most of the time. I plan on staying on the medication, as it's supposed to continue to get better over the next few weeks. Going to ask my doctor if I should go up to 300mg, as it works well for many others. This drug may be good if you've tried SSRIs and they haven't worked well for you. I tried sertraline, and it made me feel good for about a week, two weeks tops, then I would crash way back down.

I got on Wellbutrin about 2 months ago.  I started with 150 mg and  went to 300 in a little over a week.  I had minimal side effects.  I did notice the first few days and after the dose increase that I felt a little buzzy and had good energy.  I was concerned it would make my anxiety worse; it didn't.  Unfortunately, it didn't do enough for my anxiety (which it isn't usually used for that, which is why I'm still giving it a 9/10).  It pulled me out of a very dark hole, but I really needed something more geared towards anxiety.   Probably wasn't the best choice of meds for me, IMO.

I finally told my doctor I was at the end of my rope and she gave me a prescription for 150 of wellbutrin XL it sat there for months because I didn’t want to depend on medicine to make me feel human again. Then I started to take it and it made me feel slightly better and then the thoughts came back in and I went back to my doctor and and told her so she upped my dosage to 300mg and I noticed a huge change but at first but I started to notice I was happier and smiling more I was getting up doing stuff and I started letting the world back in .

We were hesitant to try it on me given how severe my anxiety had gotten, but after I worked through all of the aforementioned medications, we decided to just give it a try.1) The first 2 weeks on this med were absolutely BRUTAL. I can only imagine that that is what death feels like. 2) Idk how to explain it, but it somehow makes my anxiety worse and better at the same time. 3) Overall, I feel amazing.

I constantly felt as though my body was buzzing and it was IMPOSSIBLE TO RELAX. I would be on Florida’s beaches with a nice pina colada in my hand and STILL was not able to fully relax. Also hobbies…hobbies became like homework to me and I was doing hobbies not because I enjoyed them anymore but to just pass the time and keep myself alive. I no longer believe in medicine because of this awful drug. Please…if you have depression I highly suggest seeing a therapist first and work on coping skills instead of resorting to medicine.

25,Bupropion,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 7, 2021",0,"My psychiatrist recommended that I take Bupropion beginning April 24, 2021 for a diagnosis of MDD. Initially, I was prescribed 150mg and took it each morning along with 20mg of Propranolol. Bupropion suppressed my appetite and suspended most of my cravings — I’d still have cravings for chocolate a few days prior to my period coming but not nearly as strong as they usually were. My doctor checked in with me weekly about how I was feeling and he decided to increase my dosage to 300mg after a few weeks of me taking the 150. I then began to notice a change in how my clothes fit and simply how I felt overall. I ended up weighing myself about two months after I started the 150 and I’d lost about 20lbs. Recently, my doctor recommended increasing my dosage by another 150mg. Fast forward a few more months and me taking a 450mg dose for about a week now, I’ve lost 41lbs.

The mood stabilizer is the best medication I've ever taken. It's helped me 100%. With the Wellbutrin XL I started out with tons of energy and no appetite but after awhile that stopped.

I understand people take this for weightloss and it truly does work,  but the problem with that is if your trying to build muscle or strength it's hard because you have no appetite on this medication and you could easily eat just once a day and that's not cool .

I'm embarrassed to say it took me a long time to work myself up to tell my doctor I needed a change, and even then it unfortunately it took a lot of false starts to get on bupropion. While I've not been taking bupropion for long I have noticed a rapid change for the better. I feel happier, have more energy, and most importantly (for me), I'm eating less and rarely feel deprived.

106,Bupropion,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,,"February 28, 2020",19,"I just wanted to share some of my knowledge of bupropion as I am currently taking it and have done a lot of research on it. Bupropion is pharmacologically different than any other antidepressant and is the only one it’s class. It does not have any effect on serotonin, but prevents the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. Because it doesn’t affect serotonin it has much different side effect profile than those associated with SSRIs. Medicines that affect the serotonin can often be very sedating and include symptoms such as apathy, somnolence, sexual dysfunction. SSRIs also do not affect epinephrine; a healthy amount of Epinephrine can be helpful in regulating mood, sleep, etc. Gives you energy instead of taking away energy; which can be counter productive during depressive episodes! increases sex drive instead of taking away; which as well all know can cause many relational problems and make someone feel sad in and of itself.",Fightthegoodfight

My doctor put me on 150mg which got rid of the headaches, but my motivation got worse. I felt like I could do things I couldn’t when depressed, but also like I needed to convince myself to do anything extra. My doctor then gave me 5mg of lexapro on top of the Wellbutrin and its good. Recently got my blood work done for being fatigued, sleeping a LOT and brain cloudiness - its because I have a severe vitamin D deficiency. I highly recommend getting your bloodwork done if you feel like this suddenly loses effectiveness. A low vitamin D level can also cause depression which probably made it harder for me to feel better even on medications.

Additionally, I can be anxious/have irrational thoughts now, but it's nothing from which I can't talk myself down. Overall, my self-esteem and sense of wellbeing has vastly improved.

I have lots of energy, (sometimes, too much). It doesn't help with my anxiety; I still need Klonopin now and then. It also gives me insomnia, again, the Klonopin helps there.
