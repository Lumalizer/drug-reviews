I mentioned this to my Dr. She switched my meds to Pristiq. Almost instantly I could tell a big difference even though I was told they were very similar. It made me miserable. The more I took it the worse I got. I finally had enough and seen another physician who put me back on the Effexor. So far no more zaps. I'm guessing they were from my body adjusting to the medication. Either way, I'd take a zap or two over feeling terrible!",Greenjeans
1,Desvenlafaxine,Major Depressive Disorder,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 13, 2022",1,Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):Appears to work faster then the multiple varieties of other drugs Drs have tried over the last 28 years.   It’s a bit numbing at times but it’s better than the way I usually feel. I wish it did more for anxiety but nothing except addictive drugs work for my major anxiety/agoraphobia. That’s the worst because now Drs refuse to give any benzo's to anyone w/ any precious addictive issues.   Which to me is like telling a cancer patient they can't have pain meds.   It’s definitely discriminatory.  But the Prestiq HAS helped a bit better and faster then prob 10 + other kinds I’ve been prescribed as a lab rat.,Nmsully

Found it very hard to cry about anything, which was beneficial for me because I used to cry over little things and quite frequently. Pristiq does not make me numb emotionally, it just takes the edge off a bit. Only side effect was delayed ejaculation, but this is not so significant considering the benefits it offers.",John

4,Desvenlafaxine,Major Depressive Disorder,8.0,,"January 29, 2022",3,"Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):So far I am on day three of Pristiq. I was prescribed 25 mg but was very anxious to even begin it because it is an SNRI. And I suffer from crippling anxiety really bad so taking a norepenephrine made me overthink this medication. The doc said that I could cut the 25 mg pill so that I would be on 12.5 mg, when you cut it it is no longer extended release. So far I have noticed I have more energy and I'm actually staying in the moment as well as smiling and no doom and gloom. I was having really bad DP/DR prior. It was a constant struggle to stay in the present moment. The chatter was so loud in my head. It has stopped now. And I get a boost of energy with the 12.5 of Pristiq. It lasts until evening time which is fine because then I can take my OTC meds to unwind for evening and sleep. I've been sleeping a lot better. I'm actually not afraid to leave my house. And the intrusive thoughts aren't steering my day like they used to. So far so good.",Shannon B

I have preexisting GI issues, so this medication has caused loss of appetite and extreme weight loss. I'm dual diagnosed with mental health and substance abuse, but have been off drugs and alcohol, now working on mental health. Pristiq makes me want to go back to drugs to feel good and sociable again, but I won't do it. I just want to feel the life come back into me. It's been gone for so long. I'll keep searching for the right anti depressant.  Not to mention I'm in Bolivia, so psychiatric care isn't top notch. But I'm hopeful I'll get there. Thank you for all your posts.

Needless to say, I've tried a variety of antidepressants, many have worked for a bit then stopped, but non have helped with both the depression and anxiety.  My psychiatrist changed me over to Pristiq on August 15th, 2021 and we slowly started the increase from 25 mg to 100 mg.  With the 25 mg and 50 mg I didn't notice a difference in the depression and felt like my anxiety was getting worse.  I started on 100 mg in October and as of now I've noticed a huge difference.  The anxiety has improved and the feelings of daily dread caused by my depression and loss of interest have improved incredibly.  I feel a lot better.  Note, I am also doing CBT therapy via Zoom once a week, so I'm sure that has helped too, but this drug has made a huge difference.  I actually don't feel terrible anymore.  I'm interested in doing things again and am no longer isolating myself",Nevergiveup

I've been on so many meds, had ECT treatments. The whole 9 yards. It started with nausea and dizziness within an hour. By hour 2 my joints hurt so bad and extremely fatigued. I dissociated  bad throughout most of the day at work, I had to be snapped out of it. That night after work...my muscles and joints hurt so bad and I was still dissociating so bad.  I felt so so bad and that came with a whole new set of emotions. I emailed my psychiatrist. She called me the next day literally 10 minutes after my daily dose (in which I cried and cried because I had to take this pill again) and told me to stop taking it immediately. That my body was metabolizing it too fast and I should not be having these kinds of side effects at all. So, now we're on to trintellix. And if that doesn't do the trick, some nasal spray treatment.

I have suffered terribly with anxiety and then depression for the past 4 years. It got to the point where I could hardly function, couldn't sleep, couldn't think straight, no interest in anything, even going into stores was really hard. After trying 10 different medications I was at a point where I had to try something because nothing was helping including SSRI's. I reluctantly gave Pristiq a try and I have to say the experience has been like nothing I have had before. I am on 50 mg and going into week 5 and have been feeling better and better. I had mild side effects which have mostly gone away. I am not 100% back to my old self but the difference is so profound that I had to share to let others know that there is hope. I have combined it with an improved diet and self care and I finally feel like I am on the right track.",Greatful

Overall it has helped me to feel upbeat about life. I don't have panic attacks any more nor do I experience the crippling fear and worry/paranoia that I had. It had even helped with the OCD compulsions that I have. However, it does not help with the brain fog very well. I still feel like I am not able to function in that regard--concentrating and finding motivation to do more than the minimum is still very difficult and hardly ever happens but at least I can now do the minimum. My menstruation cycle has changed and is very heavy. Super heavy. I am going to talk to my provider about this. Overall this medication to help with panic that anxiety brings is wonderful.

After several years on paxil, Zoloft and effexor I still did not seem whole and was still very depressed but in a zombie like state feeling no emotion to anything. I weaned myself off. Then my Dr. told me about Pristiq and started me at 50 mgs which helped just not much. The next week he upped my dose to 100 mgs and a whole new world opened up for me. I didn't experience any side effects And also dropped some weight. For me Pristiq changed my life for the better. Very expensive drug but worth it.",SBritt
12,Desvenlafaxine,Major Depressive Disorder,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 18, 2021",1,Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):I started Pristiq after stopping Viibryd due to nausea and not trying to discourage anyone from trying Pristiq but it made me feel like I was on speed or something. Did not even last a week as I could not sleep and had uncontrollable shivering. I am now 48 hours off and starting to feel better again. It made my anxiety so bad I had to use Lorazapam for the first 3 days. Don't read this as a horror story as I have dealt with worse in the past but beware there is a chance that it is too strong for some people. Even starting at 25mg I felt like I was on MDMA. I have never experience this sort of reaction from any other medication in the past. Be careful and best of luck to everyone. I know it works wonders for some people.

Well, we are now to almost 5/6 years later.. and I have realized, by going back in my journaling (that has tapered off so much over the years) that, I did and DO have some bad side effects from this medication. I have lost my enjoyment for life, that I DID have.  I used to actually like to do things, like play video games, go shopping, read books, go to the movies, go to the gym, clean (I LOVED cleaning), etc etc. I have developed what my GP had diagnosed as hypersomnia, but it started right after my dose was adjusted to 50mg, And I just feel lazy and from all of that, I have gained weight.

I have treatment resistant depression; I've tried 4-5 other SSRIs and SNRIs and had to quit all of them for various serious side effects. I also underwent TMS treatment with absolutely no effect. I was on Pristiq 25 mg for approximately 15 days with minimal side effects (except for significantly reduced stamina during my workouts) and was starting to see what I thought might be some positive effects, but then I suddenly started getting severe migraines every day. I am a lifelong episodic migraine sufferer, normally averaging one migraine every 6-10 weeks, but the daily migraines were more severe and longer lasting (8-10 hours) than I am used to - I can't afford to be out of work the majority of the day because of a migraine, so I had to stop taking Pristiq.

I tried it for 4 days and got so sick so I went off of it I went into my medication cabinet and saw Pristiq and I was like I have nothing left to lose and it worked so well and actually helped my mood and intrusive thoughts I went back and told my doctor and she did end up getting put on a higher dose 100mg but Honestly give this medication a try not just a week like I did the first time give it at least a month it saved me.,emmy

He put me on 25mg, while weaning me off of the Prozac. At first, Pristiq made me mentally foggy and dizzy. I've actually been reading good reviews for this medication and decided to give it a try. I know that it takes some time for meds to get used to your body, so you have to give it some time. As of right now, I'm not feeling suicidal and I'm crying at the drop of a hat anymore, which is awesome to me.

If you've tried a few types of antidepressants and they aren't effective, I would recommend asking your doctor about the possibility of having a methylfolate deficiency or to try some testing out to see what could be going on.

My Dr. prescribed the 25mg. tabs which helped to lower the dosage. After 3 weeks - finally off Pristiq! Meanwhile, I was building-up Trintellix from 5 - 10 - 15 - 20 mg. The best results are at 20mg. Also, Trintellix is not just an SSRI. It hits the other receptors that are targeted by SSNI's and Bupropion (dopamine).  So, I was able to stop taking Wellbutrin as well after 25 years. Cost is $295 per month - but, worth it. Also, there's no time release (SR or XL) with Trintellex - so, this eliminates the release differences between generic and brand.

I had headaches almost daily within that time and it increased my blood pressure, I felt like it wasn't making any changes in my mood or anxiety. Around the 6th week everything went downhill. Fits of crying and rage, anxiety came back worse than before, I had the worst migraines I'd ever experienced, diarrhea no matter what I ate or drank, severe abdominal pain, and also chills pretty much all of the time. I called my doctor right away because I was becoming very scary and feeling awful. Definitely not a medicine for me!",No-Go

126,Desvenlafaxine,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 26, 2016",39,"Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):Lifted me out of a mood of despair.  Most importantly, it was the best anger management I ever found.  Clear headed, no anxiety, no side affects other than mild nausea, and that ONLY if I take it on an empty stomach.  Don't miss a dose though, it will make you REALLY woozy.  Stopped for a few months, fell into depression, but Pristiq pulled me right back up when I started back.  Remember that the Rx says specifically that you may need 4 weeks to notice an improvement.  Bear that in mind when you read all these reviews by people who quit taking it after 1 or 2 days.",Mike1967_1

The first day that took Pristiq I was spacey, high, and felt like throwing up. The second day I lost the feeling to vomit but still felt very high. Today, being the 5th day, I awoke with desperate feelings of anxiety and black clouds of worry. It's difficult to sleep - maybe 2-3 hours at a time and actually falling asleep takes longer (even if I'm feeling the need to sleep). My head and neck muscles seem paralyzed when I yawn. It's as if they freeze and can't return to their normal position after the yawn is complete. Eventually they do. (five seconds) I still feel exceedingly high but it's not a ""good"" high. My skin is super sensitive and I get intermittent chills).",FeelingStoned
128,Desvenlafaxine,Major Depressive Disorder,10.0,,"October 26, 2015",26,"Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):After having my daughter last September, I fell into severe PPD and anxiety. I tried many types of meds, but had minimal if any relief and most left me more exhausted than I was to begin with. I started Pristiq Aug 6th of this year after having a DNA profile of the meds I could tolerate (not very many!) and with every week, I've felt better. Every week (except for the first few weeks), I've been able to look back and see how much I feel more like myself again and how much my anxiety has lessened. Almost 12 weeks since I began and I am very thankful for it. Remember, it's not a quick fix, no antidepressant is, it definitely took time.",Samantha cee
129,Desvenlafaxine,Major Depressive Disorder,4.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 26, 2015",19,"Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):Started on Pristiq one year ago. I had a slight positive change in my depression. I was able to get out of bed, shower, do some work. However, I developed OCD where I HAD to continually rub my nose or pick my scalp. After 6-7 months, I became anti-social, completely lethargic, did not dress or shower for days but sat in a chair rubbing my nose! I had no range of emotion - no anger, no joy - no feelings. The death of a good friend did not affect me. I decided to stop Pristiq - slowly - and I have had HELLISH withdrawals reducing by 25% every 2 weeks. Withdrawals included depersonalization, confusion, inability to think clearly, panic attacks, tremors, nightmares, tremors, and out of body sensations. I would NEVER recommend this drug.",Pristiqno

Sleep was horrible or almost non existent.  Was very anxious all day.  Could barely leave the house and was shaky all the time.  Made me way too amped up.  I have treatment resistant depression.  Thought this might be worth a try after failing with many SSRIs  (Zoloft was only one that worked for the most part but didn't get me all the way there).  Can help some people with anxiety.  I was not one of them.  Wanted to give it 4 weeks but could barely make the 3 week mark before I cracked.,Brett84

First two weeks it eased me off my depression. Then all the side effects came into play. Extreme anxiety, sweating, and feeling out of it and high all the time. Forgetting to take it was like hell and made me physically sick and agitated. Would not recommend if celexa or prozac worked for you at one point. Made me feel like a zombie and hard to get anything done. Felt a lot of fatigue as well. Overall horrible experience with a big price attached to it.",Anonymous

I felt tiredness every day. I increased my physical activity to make my body triger to relax. It did not work. Within three months my diptession got worse. I felt anxiety, discomfort in my body, tiredness, lost interest to my favorit activities, in other words I survived.Then at the end of May I started taking Quaetepine 1 tab before night. It made me sleep 4-5 hrs at night. Then I splited 50mg of Pristiq into 4 parts (12.5 mg) and took them for 4 days. Next 4 days I was taking 25mg. Then 50 mg next 12 days. Now I am on 100 mg.

I knew it was working when the initial shock to my body passed - I was ready to give something a chance for my anxiety and major depression. So, two weeks on it I'm starting to feel a lot happier. but there has been some slight apprehension along the way due to some side effects: constipation and worried about other potential SE's from SNRI's but this medication seems to be pretty mild (50mg) and has been helping to level out my Serotonin - norepinephrine levels.",24 year old female

With that said, I was suffering from severe MDD, anxiety, OCD, border lining on psychosis after I had my son last summer. I was so miserable for his first year of life, and then I was finally put on Pristiq after trying about 10 other anti-depressants/anxiety meds. I seriously feel like a normal person again. I can enjoy my family and friends, and am able to maintain my relationships with them.

I was originally put on the 50mg and my mood drastically changed from depressed and anxious to happy and functioning. Do NOT forget to take it, though. I forgot to take a dose one day and I was a mess the whole day, and then when I finally took it again, it didn't work as well so I had to have the dosage doubled. Then I ran out and couldn't get in touch with my psychiatrist so I spent about a week off of it. Was extremely depressed and had to be watched closely by my family and boyfriend to make sure that I didn't hurt myself. Tried going back on it but it no longer worked. I'm not sure if I hadn't had those mishaps with taking it if I would still be on it but it was definitely a lifesaver while it worked.",Anonymous
