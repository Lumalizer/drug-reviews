0,Clozapine,Paranoid Disorder,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 18, 2019",17,"My husband has been given a chemical lobotomy. He can't sit still , he bounces and makes faces while watching tv and thats all he does all day. I can't take him anywhere he bugs his eyes out at people and makes monkey faces. How on earth did this questionable drug get approved. He is totally unproductive , slow , forgetful and delusional.",Tracy
1,Clozapine,Paranoid Disorder,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 13, 2015",48,Tried may meds. But clozapine has turned me around. Now working part time. Involved with community and living/loving my life. Medication is not the only key to recovery though. You cant medicate life. II need to be supported and surrounded by people who are good for me.,Rotton fred
2,Clozapine,Paranoid Disorder,8,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 29, 2015",31,"My son has been on Clozaril for 3 years. He was dx with Bipolar when he was just 6 years old.  He had literally been on every anti-psychotic drug until his 7th hospItal stay, his regular psychiatrist and the hospital's Dr decided to try this medicine. As far as his psychosis it has been a wonder drug. But physically, Clozaril is destroying his body. In the  first 6 months, he was dx with asthma. The worst of his problems that developed in the past 9 months has been GI and liver. He now has severe ensephagitis, gastritis, 4 ulcers and NAFLD (fatty liver disease). He has also gained over 50 lbs. Not just teenage pounds. I was also told when he started the Clozaril, it isn't really approved for patients under 18. Too late now.",Anonymous
