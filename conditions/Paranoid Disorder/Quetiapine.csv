0,Quetiapine,Paranoid Disorder,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 14, 2021",2,"I was on this for a drug induced psychosis.  At first (3 month) this medication help reduce voices, paranoia and anxiety surprisingly with NO negative side effects. After 4/5 months of taking from between 150 mg and 250 mg I experienced and still do experience from time to time extreme issue with swallowing, I really have to think about swallowing before I can do it, sounds funny? Not really. It's terrifying because your body reacts as if you're choking. Second negative side effect is really REALLY bad nightmares that feel very VERY real. And thirdly extreme muscle stiffness to the point I have to use one arm to move the other sometimes. So.... I had to weigh up would I want to feel paranoid, suspicious, anxious, hearing voices or would I want to have none of that and these side effects? It's really a 'pros and cons' moments and I chose to stay on this medication I'm now on 300mg per day but I take 100mg on a morning and 200mg on an evening. You won't find an anti psychotic with zero side effects just pick the one which you can manage",Ajmayn
1,Quetiapine,Paranoid Disorder,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 13, 2021",0,"Have been on Serequel for 7 years now and have had minimal side effects. It is an expensive drug and is on the pharmaceutical free list for people who come under the category of several psychiatric disorders. Have started seeing a new doctor who would not prescribe Serequel for me on the free list because he believed I didn’t fit into the prescribing category so he wrote me a script but said I would have to pay for it, so I thought this doctor was a narcissistic bastard and told him I will continue taking Serequel from a previous doctor who will prescribe it for me on the free list. It is obvious the new doctor didn’t want to prescribe the drug because he is a dishonest prick and dose not want the responsibility of monitoring its effectiveness, so much for a replacement as you cannot just stop taking the medicine. A particular doctor because of his personal views is quite possibly heading towards a malpractice.",Henry
2,Quetiapine,Paranoid Disorder,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2020",5,"Hi, I have MDD, psychosis and PTSD. Quetiapine did nothing for me except knock me out to sleep but only for 6 hours. The side effects have been pretty bad. I haven’t pooped in a week, craziest nightmares where I’m always dying, hot and cold sweats, always dry mouth and now painful urination. Did nothing for my paranoia. I did like that it knocked me out but that’s it. 4 weeks on it and now I’m coming off. Obviously didn’t work for me.",Ralph
3,Quetiapine,Paranoid Disorder,7,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 12, 2020",6,My father whom also suffers from Parkinson's disease has developed paranoid and delusional behaviour the past few years. He's been taking a small dose of this drug (37.5mg at night) for almost two years now along with a bunch of other anti depressants and a tranqulizer. It worked pretty nice until now. The effect seems to be wearing off now and we are trying to add to the dosage.,Hamed

5,Quetiapine,Paranoid Disorder,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 28, 2019",12,"I am bipolar one with severe anxiety. I take other pills for my bipolar including a dose of Seroquel at night but my dr. added me 3 small doses during the day for my anxiety, which has dramatically decreased. I am not worried all the time, or having panic attacks and I am leaving the house to shop, unlike before.  Finally I am seeing anxiety relief.",Sh

7,Quetiapine,Paranoid Disorder,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 10, 2017",6,Its only OK once I've fallen asleep and maintaining that sleep but honestly I still have genuine reasons to be paranoid in life based on misconceptions certain associates ect but yea still depressed restless legs less paranoid over thinking but more frustrated and anxious I eat a lot on it and well I guess proper therapy sessions would've been a better approach for me,Anonymous
8,Quetiapine,Paranoid Disorder,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 30, 2016",4,"This medication did not work for my paranoia, anxiety, depression, and delusions.  In fact, it made me feel worse.  I started to believe more ridiculous things are going on around me.  I actually surprisingly lost a little weight but that could be attributed to quitting breastfeeding in the process.  I slept really well on this medicine which was helpful with the intrusive thoughts.  I had a problem going from 300mg-400mg.  The twitching became extreme....especially in my face. I became severely depressed on this medication because my intrusive thoughts started to feel more real.  The only perk to this drug was that it increased my libido. I am now starting a new medication.  I guess every person is different",Momwithproblems
9,Quetiapine,Paranoid Disorder,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 14, 2015",17,"I'm on quetiapine 200mg fast release, I take one before sleep works really well when catching them zzzzz... The funny thing is my Dreams are more wacky and a lot more Vivid then ever. But as long as the sleep issue is good I am happy. No problem at all besides the wacky dreams. The pills keep me away from Meth..",brado
10,Quetiapine,Paranoid Disorder,8,,"May 2, 2014",30,I have Delusional parasitosis. It has made my life a living hell for over 3 years. I was prescribed Seroquel last month and after taking it one time my symptoms we're nearly gone. For me it's a godsend.,chellegovea
11,Quetiapine,Paranoid Disorder,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 2, 2012",21,"I have been using quetiapine now for several weeks and have found it works wonders for my paranoid behaviour. I take 50mg in the morning and 200mg before bed, my mood is so much better. If I miss a dose my family can tell so I try not to miss any.",just stace :)
12,Quetiapine,Paranoid Disorder,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 9, 2012",32,"Seroquel XR (quetiapine):Seroquel XR worked for me better than the Seroquel. From my understanding the XR is an extended release vs the regular Seroquel. My paranoid thoughts have completely gone away except for the normal paranoia that everyone has of people sometimes talking about them. It also gives me a lot of energy during the day and I do not have to take naps. I have tried Abilify and other medicines, but none seem to work as well as the Seroquel XR.",Anonymous
13,Quetiapine,Paranoid Disorder,5,,"April 8, 2012",13,"Very sedating; put me to sleep nicely, especially when I was on Abilify, it was a great relief. Was too tired to be psychotic! But I gained 32 pounds in a very short time...",Anonymous
14,Quetiapine,Paranoid Disorder,9,,"June 25, 2011",32,"Seroquel (quetiapine):After seeing my GP I was prescribed 200mg at night and had my first night sleep in months. Seroquel simply saved my life, it calmed me down stopped my racing heart/mind and burning body. Over time I have been able to reduce my dose to 50mg at night and wake up refreshed for work. In the morning I drink plenty of water or weak tea, also found B vitamins or multivitamins worked well along with magnesium tablet or powder three times a day.",maxzee
15,Quetiapine,Paranoid Disorder,9,,"June 8, 2009",50,"Seroquel (quetiapine):I was given this medication for alcohol/drug psychosis and after 2 years in 12 step recovery programs I am still on 450 milligrams. I started a reduction regime and was down to 150 milligrams and my paranoia symptoms returned. Went to see doctor and resumed my previous dosage. I experience no side effects listed but must say I am in good health and keep fit. There is the issue of weight gain, using fitness I managed to lose 10 kilograms.",pistol
