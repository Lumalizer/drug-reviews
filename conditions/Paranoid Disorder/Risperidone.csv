1,Risperidone,Paranoid Disorder,7,,"August 13, 2021",1,I've been on this medicine for almost 3 years and it's ok. It helps with my delusions but I usually have to take another medicine together with it. I don't like the weight gain. I have gained 25 pounds on it plus it usually makes me more tired where I can sleep 10 hours instead of 8. I overall I say it's ok but everybody is different.,Anonymous
2,Risperidone,Paranoid Disorder,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 27, 2021",2,"I got diagnosed with Postpartum Psychosis 3 months ago and my doctor put me on this medication. It is god sent. 2 days ago I just had a hysterectomy and have been feeling mentally off and been having psychosis symptoms and they’re very scary, so I’m bumping up my risperidone to 3mg at night. This is a fast acting medication so hopefully I’ll feel better soon. If you feel like your schizophrenia or delusions are scaring you and need a quick fix, this medication is definitely the way to go (other than anti anxiety meds like Xanax). Love this medication!",Dance4life54
3,Risperidone,Paranoid Disorder,3,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 3, 2021",3,"Ten years total experience (approx. ) with risperidone approximately five years on and five to six years off.  While on risperidal (risperidone generic ) my physical direction was weight gain and diabetes.  My waist size went from my normal approximate of 33 to 36 and needing 38 soon.   I also was at risk of diabetes and being threatened with medical intervention.  I walked miles and ate responsibly,  I still gained weight.   The physician and I agreed to cut the dose in half (several decreases) until completely off.   I did not see real improvement until completely stopped.   I soon returned to my normal waist size and metabolism.  I take care of my problems instead of not noticing and being in a state of sluggish.  While off,  I have to deal with problems of life and this world,  although it is worth it.   Being forced to take a med. should be ethically evaluated. I am currently not at risk of diabetes and eat whatever....,  I was born with a healthy metabolism and burn my food in daily work life.",Customer a
4,Risperidone,Paranoid Disorder,1,,"June 29, 2019",14,Made me feel the worst than I  ever felt after taking it. Burning in my stomach then slowly you become unaware that your a zombie. . But I do know. It made me feel the worst feeling ever. I just keep doing it said you had to wait. But it mostly just messed me up,Jonak
5,Risperidone,Paranoid Disorder,8,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 1, 2018",22,"I was started on respiridone 11 months ago, I started on 0.5mg and went up to 5mg at one stage. In the past three months somewhere in the range of 1.5mg to 2mg is my prefered dosage. When I think back on my quality of life before respiridone it makes me appreciate how helpful this drug has been for me. I find it very calming and I still believe I have my personality, other people have noticed that I am a lot more positive and less anxious. I gave it an 8, due to the potential of weight gain, I did find the higher dosage (>2mg) to make me lazy and unmotivated thats why I brought it back down to the 1mg to 2mg range and I still get all the beneifits at this range. I have lost 5kg in the past 4 months (eating normally and long distance running).I suffered from paranoid thoughts coupled with OCD.",Hopes

8,Risperidone,Paranoid Disorder,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 31, 2016",61,"I have had three serious psychotic events in my life.  The first was Post Partum Psychosis and hospitalization, the second was a breakthrough of my medication about 16 years later, at that time I was taking Mellaril and Zoloft.  I gradually weaned from the Mellaril because I was concerned about tardive disconecia.  I was fine for the next eight years, and had another psychotic break while under some extreme stress.  At that time, my physician added the Risperdal, and I had rapid disappearance off the anxiety and paranoia (it took about a week), and back to work in about a month. I have continued in a high functioning position as a university professor since that time, for the last twelve years, with no additional episodes.",Ms. O.
9,Risperidone,Paranoid Disorder,9,,"July 21, 2016",37,"I've been on Risperidone for a long time now, and I think it's working great for me. I use to have paranoid thoughts, but after taking Risperidone, I've gained trust in other people more. I think it helped my paranoid thoughts go away by leveling out my mood and anxiety. I think I genetically get anxiety passed down from relatives, but who really knows. I hope I stay on Risperidone for a long time.I didn't even gain weight on it. If you have anxiety  tell your doctor to put you on Risperidone.",Patient0101
10,Risperidone,Paranoid Disorder,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 9, 2015",23,"Takes away Paranoia pretty well. Along with Paroxetine, Clonazepam, and Risperidone I feel way less paranoid. I think Risperidone is the main culprit at eliminating Paranoia.",Jermo102
11,Risperidone,Paranoid Disorder,4,,"June 1, 2011",16,"After taking Risperidone for 6 months to relieve my panic, fear and irrational thoughts associated with my PTSD, I encountered very little relief. What I did gain was the WEIGHT. I gained 50 lbs in 6 months with no change in eating habits. After voicing this concern to my doctor, I was taken off the medication with no withdrawal effects and in 10 months time I lost 49lbs with no exercise and eating a healthier low glycemic index diet.",kmaverikaz
12,Risperidone,Paranoid Disorder,1,,"February 1, 2011",16,"Risperdal (risperidone):I take Risperdal to treat my schizophrenia, but I also suffer from paranoia. I know Risperdal is not used to directly treat my paranoia, but it's done nothing for my schizophrenia either. The voices and hallucinations are still prominent.",Anonymous
13,Risperidone,Paranoid Disorder,2,,"April 3, 2010",25,"Risperdal (risperidone):I was prescribed a low dosage of Risperidone and it was effective at eliminating my paranoid thoughts. However, after 1 year, this medication caused me to gain weight to a level I had never been in my life. I went from 178 lbs to 218 lbs with no changes in diet or exercise. My doctor took me off the medication in July 2009 and by Christmas 2009, my weight dropped to 169 lbs, with some dietary changes. ",kmaverikaz
