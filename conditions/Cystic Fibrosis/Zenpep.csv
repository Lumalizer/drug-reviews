0,Zenpep,Cystic Fibrosis,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 28, 2020",0,I've taken Zenpep for most of my life.  I take 5 caps with meals and snacks because I have fat in every meal. It works great and the only time I've had an issue is if I had an extra fatty meal and didn't take an additional capsule. I recommend Zenpep to anyone with CF.,Crunchy
