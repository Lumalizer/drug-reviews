0,Bactrim,Prostatitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2021",0,"I developed a case of prostatitis. Was given Bactrim and told to take 2 pills for 30 days. After about day 3 or 4, I started getting flank pain. I called the doc and he said Bactrim won't cause that. Maybe I have a stone forming. Did some research online and found that Bactrim is not recommended for people with kidney issues. It can cause them to shut down. I'm currently out of town, 5 hours from home, and in quite a bit of pain. I plan to head home in the morning without taking my morning dose and go straight to the hospital.",Warning
1,Bactrim,Prostatitis,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 2, 2021",0,Was prescribed bactrim 2x/day for 30 days for prostatitis symptoms.First day fine but by third day throbbing neck pain that aspirin or tylenol didn't take care of. No excessive leaning forward or sleeping on my stomach to crank the neck so I believe it was from the drug. Little bit of nausea and anxiety at the same time.Hard to say if it did much for my prostate because by the time I started I was 70% better from my initial doctor visit.,Meme
2,Bactrim,Prostatitis,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 25, 2021",1,"I went to the doctor for Prostatitis and was RX Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole).  Some background, I have high functioning anxiety and decided to write this review while I wait for my DR to call me back about changing ABX.  These other reviews are 100% accurate about severe anxiety (heart rate over 90 BPM 24/7), headaches, loss of appetite, and nausea....nothing better than throwing up stomach bile because you can't eat.  I thought I had COVID but tested negative...On the bright side, after 3 days my prostatitis went away, I guess it's a double edge sword.",scarypay90
3,Bactrim,Prostatitis,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 30, 2020",13,"Took Bactrim forte for prostatitis 2x a day, at the beginning I just had a mild itch but by day 5 my eyes became red and started seeing floaters in my vision, at this point I had to stop. Be careful with this drug .",Dan
4,Bactrim,Prostatitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 6, 2020",26,"Bactrim almost finished me. Should have known as it wasn't working anyway and I was getting the DS prescription. Suddenly became very ill, needed to go to the hospital for IV fluids, had a terrible reaction , like the worst flu I ever experienced.  2 weeks later I am still getting ringing in my ears, and watching my skin carefully, fearfully as I broke out with nasty boils all over my arms and legs. If there is permanent damage I am considering the possibility of starting a lawsuit as my health seems to have been permanently damaged. I'd never been this sick with anything like this, and I am 68 years old, have always been in good health until now! I am very angry that a prescribed medication like this could be almost lethal to me.",Blackhawkdown
5,Bactrim,Prostatitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 18, 2019",6,"Horrible .

6,Bactrim,Prostatitis,10,,"August 25, 2019",7,"I was trying to get well, I need to have both knees replaced, I could not urinate, I had a infection in my prostrate  so I was put on Bactrim   800/160  2 per day  for forty two days. After 2 days my knees stopped being painful all time and I could walk easy again, I could not believe it, nobody else believed it either. I took it for 30 days like candy, no problems. Doctor took me off of Bactrim and 2 days later the pain returned in my knees. I ask my Doc. if I could take the rest of my 16 pills she said yes, took one a day and pain went away again. I need more pills and maybe I will not need knee replacement.",gorite
7,Bactrim,Prostatitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 25, 2019",9,"This stuff should be out of market. I took it 3.5 days and got almost all side effects of it. The worse is anxiety which  you cannot get rid/reverse until last drop of Bactrim leaves your body, not talking about kidney, lung damage plus super muscle pains. Drink a lot of water and quit it once you notice that this drug is not for you. Just thankful that I am alive...",Guini
8,Bactrim,Prostatitis,1,,"March 31, 2018",8,"Bad side effects to the extent that I had to stop after 2 days.  Flu like symptoms, bad headache, pain in muscles and joints, low fever, no energy, could not eat, nausea - you name it, I had it.  Too bad as I think it was starting to knock down my bacterial prostatitis.  The Flu like symptoms were so convincing that I stopped for a few days, felt better, then started again just to make certain I didn't have the Flu.",Dragon
9,Bactrim,Prostatitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 13, 2017",5,"I took one pill of a two week prescription and immediately had a splitting headache. Six hours later I had difficulty breathing. Body aches and joint pain also kicked in. Two days later I am finally starting to feel better, but my right knee still hurts. This drug is (almost) banned in the U.K.  And should be looked at by the FDA.  You need to know if you are allergic to the sulfa class of drugs before even thinking about taking this drug.",Sidecar
