Was given Bactrim and told to take 2 pills for 30 days. After about day 3 or 4, I started getting flank pain. I called the doc and he said Bactrim won't cause that. Maybe I have a stone forming. Did some research online and found that Bactrim is not recommended for people with kidney issues. It can cause them to shut down. I'm currently out of town, 5 hours from home, and in quite a bit of pain. I plan to head home in the morning without taking my morning dose and go straight to the hospital.",Warning

No excessive leaning forward or sleeping on my stomach to crank the neck so I believe it was from the drug. Little bit of nausea and anxiety at the same time.Hard to say if it did much for my prostate because by the time I started I was 70% better from my initial doctor visit.,Meme

Figured my body would sort it out and deal with it. At 12 days uncontrollable diarhea and too sick to move out of bed. Even uncontrollable diarrhea in bed. Stopped it 15 hours ago. Feel slightly better. Now to research the next horrible drug.  It actually did help the prostate problems somewhat. Wish I could have stayed on it. God knows I tried.,Sick as a dog

8,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Prostatitis,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 17, 2020",1,"I was prescribed SIX WEEKS treatment of Bactrim for prostatitis.  (The additional two drugs intended to treat the urination issues were so terrible that I stopped them after a few days).  My symptoms improved dramatically by the second week of Bactrim, but I was experiencing the headaches, which were manageable.Worse were the gastrointestinal problems. I was familiar with these from Augmentin, but they are common with all broad-spectrum antibiotics.  Fortunately, it occurred to me to take PRObiotics to restore the GOOD bacteria in the gut that the ANTIbiotics were killing.  This has eliminated the diarrhea. In retrospect, I probably should have tried the Urologist's suggestion of Levaquin, but I had had a reaction to it years ago, and I didn't want to try that again.",dogtags40i a

I have 5 days left and my prostate is still swollen as it was when I was on other stuff. I was on Cipro at first but after the 3rd day the side effects hit me too hard so I got taken off of it and started a 2 week course of tetracycline until I could get into the urologist office. But since this Coronavirus came into play. They canceled that appointment so I had to make different appointment at the doctors and tell them that tetracycline is worthless against this type of thing. So then I got out on Bactrim. Bactrim helped after day 5 but I haven’t seen really any improvement since.,Iminneed

I had no side effects except for feeling unwell the first day or two. I also had a horrible headache the second night but I don’t know if that was the Bactrim or not.

Not only did I have a constant 101-102 temperature fever with chills, nausea, and headache, I also got to experience about 70% of the so-called ""rare"" symptoms neck and cheek swelling, constant face and chest itching, muscle pains sharp pains not soreness, tight chest, joint pains that are sharp, restless and sleepless nights, and so much more.

Some light side effects are light headed, occasional nausea, and some interrupted sleep, some body tingling also during the day.  But if it makes these symptoms go away it's worth the tradeoff.
