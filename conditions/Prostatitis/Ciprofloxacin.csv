0,Ciprofloxacin,Prostatitis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 27, 2021",1,Cipro works and I took it for 30 days but everyone has a threshold for this medication. Some it’s a day and some it’s 50 days.I have been sick since 2016 with cipro toxicity. Now it’s 2021 and it came back. So back to the doctor next week. Bactrim didn’t work either just lowers your GFR numbers for your kidneys. No thanks.I took doxy for acne years ago and it worked and never gave me issues. So will ask for that. Anything at this point is better than Cipro and Bactim. There are lawsuits currently on Cipro in the UK for its permanent side effects. Cipro is poison and should be taken off the market. And lastly Gulf War Syndrome is directly related to our soldiers taking Cipro as a prophylactic for possible anthrax exposure. Sad but true.At all costs avoid Cipro and Bactrim. I don’t care who you are or how strong you think you are.I am a military veteran of over 20 years with 20+ years in the medical field.,Military guy
1,Ciprofloxacin,Prostatitis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 13, 2021",0,"I recently was diagnosed with prostatitis. I had to go to the ER and they gave me one week of 500mg of cipro. All was good but I ran out and one day off the cipro my symptoms returned. I went back to the ER and they gave me two weeks of levofloxacin. My symptoms were gone and I was 1 week off the levo and then my symptoms came back twice as bad. I finally got a hold of my family doctor and prescribed 28 days of doxy. Unfortunately, the doxy only kept increasing symptoms at bay. I felt fine in the morning but as my day went on my symptoms got worse and by the end of the day I was in complete agony. I got a hold of the doctor today and she prescribed me 250mg of cipro for 30 days. Hopefully this does the job. Those not having success with cipro probably have non bacterial prostatitis. Antibiotics are ineffective for this type of prostatitis.",Geo D

3,Ciprofloxacin,Prostatitis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 29, 2021",4,"Cipro (ciprofloxacin):I am 56 and have been on tamsulosin .4mg for 2 years with great results. After year one I needed two a day but did well. Out of nowhere the symptoms returned, constant feeling I had to go.. I went to my family Dr. and went over the symptoms. He was going to add propecia but did say it may take weeks to get relief. To be honest I have no idea how guys can stand that feeling and pain in the penis for months. Anyway he said try Cipro 500mg  first for a week before the propecia so we know what helps. It may be prostatitis.I have read all the negative reviews of this drug and can only say how I did. I was prescribed enough for a week. Within 2 days I was back to normal. Symptom free, I go back in a few days to see the  Dr and am not sure if he will extend it but if he does it will be fine by me. I have zero problems on this drug so far. Best move I made as to say Doc I really don't know how I can this for a month..When I did he also tried the Cipro..",Echo56

13,Ciprofloxacin,Prostatitis,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 23, 2020",4,I've been on Cipro for 6 weeks for prostatitis. I still have bad days and the nights aren't great but I've seen some improvement. Urination is better. Groin and testicle pain are both better. I have lower back pain and some taint pain mainly at night. I seem to get through the night without urinating about half the time. My feet have been feeling a bit odd and I've had burning pain in my back. Anxiety and depression have both been terrible. Like crippling at times. Possible side affects of the Cipro. I've yet to see a urologist but probably need to soon. I'm tempted to wait it out and see how the symptoms are without the Cipro to see if they all come back. Prostatitis is a pretty terrible thing and I'm not sure I like Cipro that much more. *Update* My doctor just called in another week of Cipro...,Anonymous

I went through two rounds of physical therapy, and then later on that year my right shoulder began to ache.

The most concerning thing however is the neuropathic pain. Itching, crawling and occasional shooting sensations. These are all over the body but particularly in the feet, esp the left one. They come and go. At one point it was physically unpleasant to wear shoes although this is slightly better than it was a couple of weeks ago. 4 weeks after finishing, the stinging/itching is still present. It doesn't stop me moving working but has affected my quality of life.I have type 1 diabetes, which can cause neuropathy also.

Dr Krisiloff says the elimination of three things: caffeine, alcohol, and hot/spicy foods will allow your prostate to heal.  90% of male patients that went to Dr. Krisiloff showed a complete reduction and elimination of symptoms, provided they stuck to the diet.I have taken it upon myself to go on an anti-inflammatory diet as well.

The Doxy has the least amount of side effects if you are taking for 3-4 weeks.
