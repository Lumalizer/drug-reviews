1,Levofloxacin,Prostatitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 26, 2021",1,Levaquin (levofloxacin):I was prescribed Levaquin for prostatis. I took one 500mg pill. Later on that night I experienced peripheral neuropathy. A week later I developed tendinitis in my ankles and knees. 2 weeks later I started getting extremely dry eyes. I’m in the process of putting my body back together. If you tell doctors Levaquin was the cause of your side effects most will deny it even though it has a black box warning.Worst medicine ever.,Bill
2,Levofloxacin,Prostatitis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 19, 2021",2,"Severe anxiety!! Been taking this levofloxacin for prostatitis at 500 mg for about 2 weeks. I switched to this from doxycycline 100 mg. It keeps symptoms to a minimum however not without a cost. At first everything was going well, then the anxiety came as well as the nausea from the gastritis (which I have never had ever). So basically I traded prostatitis for anxiety,  gastritis and nausea. So read the label before taking!",Topher
3,Levofloxacin,Prostatitis,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 18, 2020",3,Levaquin (levofloxacin):I also had Prostatitis.  Changed to Levaquin after the Cipro wouldn't cure it.  I also experienced severe tendonitis which my doctor never mentioned.  I usually read the adverse affects labels before taking but I had non on the levaquin.  About a week in on the medication I had to stop taking and moved on to another antibiotic.   I continued to have side effects after discontinuance and still suffer from the tendonitis today.  Having said that I had not been experiencing any problems with my tendons prior to taking this other then occasionally from over exertion.  Now it is something I live with on a daily basis.

I took 2x 500 mg pills and since then suffered acute muscle tendon and nervous system damage. Google floxed and you’ll see people have suffered for years with these symptoms. It only needs one pill. Do not try this under any circumstances.,James

On the 4th day I developed severe tendinitis to the point that I couldn’t walk. I immediately notified my doctor and discontinued the Rx. Dr. then put me on Augmentin for my supposedly bacterial infection. Ugh! Side effects should be looked at closer.,Njanie
10,Levofloxacin,Prostatitis,10.0,,"January 19, 2018",6,Levofloxacin is about the only antibiotic that works for my chronic Prostatitis.. 500mg once a day usually works for my condition. Problem is people develop resistance if they don't complete the 28 days of therapy.. Cipro does not work for me anymore and Doxy can cause some really serious photo toxic reactions.. Sunburn big time. Not many options left for me for treatment so Levo is it for me..,Goodguy72

My tongue had sore red bumps on them and turned white. It have been 11 days since I stop taking them and still having the same pain.  I am currently taking magnesium to help with the pain. I see some help from magnesium. Do not take this medicine.",Will65

14,Levofloxacin,Prostatitis,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 4, 2016",8,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):I think it should be considered medical malpractice for a physician to prescribe this drug to an elderly man with heart problems, especially known congestive heart failure.  My father didn't know he should report muscle weakness he experienced while taking this drug, and there was no followup by the physician.  Since the heart is a muscle, I think this drug propelled my father into endstage heart failure, which he now has.",CNA daughter

16,Levofloxacin,Prostatitis,10.0,,"June 27, 2010",55,Levaquin (levofloxacin):My doctor prescribed Levaquin for my prostatis.  He gave me a four week course and it has completely done the trick.  It's been 6 months and still no sign of any prostatis. I had absolutely no side effects.

I noticed that it makes my skin or tendons very tender. The first day I used it I was cooking eggs in my kitchen, I had to stop for a second because I felt some pain in my hand. I looked at my hand it was red right where it was gripping the frying pan handle. As of right now I've been having a very difficult time falling asleep. ",lga

The reason I visited this site was to see if Levaquin was the reason for two episodes of swollen lips.  The first was a big swollen lower lip at church a week ago and tonight, a swollen upper lip. The only other person to comment on this medicine on this website also had this problem.  Aside from looking grotesque in a very primitive way, it doesn't seem a big problem.",bob_f52
21,Levofloxacin,Prostatitis,,,"October 26, 2007",41,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):I took this a few years ago for prostatitis and after 1 pill I got hives on my lip. I took it again the second day and got more hives on my lip so I discontinued it. I forgot about it and for some reason saved the prescription. Anyway, I got prostatitis again and forgot about the hives, so I just took one this morning and within an hour I had a big hive on my lip. It has been a little over 2 hours now and it is begining to go away. I am not allergic to any other medication I have ever taken.",kevin_64
