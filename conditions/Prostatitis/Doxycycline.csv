0,Doxycycline,Prostatitis,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 23, 2021",0,"Never ever take Cipro for Prostatitis, regardless of what your doctor says. I was bedridden for 4 years with that poison and will never be back to normal again.Doxycycline is the only antibiotic I can take for chronic prostatitis now and it works but it’s just slower than most medications. If you miss a dose it WILL NOT set you back days or weeks. That’s simply not true and you absolutely can take it with food, regardless of what your doctor says. I would also avoid Minocycline. Again talk to your doctor and see what choices are available. Bactrim works as well but it will put a temporary strain on your kidneys and it will lower your GFR temporarily.",Military Doctor
1,Doxycycline,Prostatitis,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 1, 2021",0,"If you’re searching for relief from epididymitis or prostatitis, you’ve likely heard about this drug. Before you consider it, PLEASE attempt pelvic floor therapy to find out if your pain is caused by pelvic floor dysfunction rather than infection. Regarding this drug, it may possibly have provided inflammation relief, but it has caused me to develop intracranial hypertension leading to possibly permanent vision damage. Not at all worth it.",Jon
2,Doxycycline,Prostatitis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 12, 2021",3,"Truly a miserable and demanding drug. You MUST take it when it demands to be in your body once you've started and you MUST take it a specific amount of time after eating. You MUST not miss a single dose or you'll be set back days of your already months long regimen. If you miss this window you must discover for yourself, you will vomit the medicine back up hard enough to bust blood vessels in your eyes unless you've got a gut of steel. No medicine should be allowed to have this hold on people who are  already sick. If your doctor tells you doxycycline is the only option, do not listen and do not accept this script. Ask for something else.  Don't even give it a chance.  Doxycycline will take control of you, and it will feel like it's never going to end.",C.
3,Doxycycline,Prostatitis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 8, 2021",12,"Best drug for prostatitis but must be used long term as per the professor Malone lee protocol to avoid infection coming back. I took it twice a day 100 mg, for 3 months which completely cured me, just make sure to use protection to avoid being introduced to new bacteria whilst taking it.",Pauly
4,Doxycycline,Prostatitis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 31, 2021",10,"This is my 4th round of this drug doxycycline for Prostatitis. Two tablets 100mg a day. Longest was 12 weeks. Did not like taking it that long, but did.  Very anxious taking it, but no side effects. Just a little upset stomach since you have to take it on an empty stomach. Helps get rid of prostatitis for me. Usually within days it gets rid of it.",J
5,Doxycycline,Prostatitis,4,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 19, 2021",5,"Was first prescribed this at 100mg twice a day. At first it was doing ok but then I noticed I was in fear all the time, googling everything and assumed it was going to be the end of me. This stuff made me have severe anxiety and depression.  It brought the prostatitis to a minimum and kept it at that level so I am thankful for that, that being said the dark side of me really came out. Please READ FOR YOURSELF about this medication before taking. P.s. still suffering from side effects",Topher
6,Doxycycline,Prostatitis,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 15, 2021",2,"I took doxycycline (100mg twice a day) for 28 days and experienced no side effects. However, it also did not resolve the issue, and I continue to have symptoms.",Brett
7,Doxycycline,Prostatitis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 3, 2020",3,"Taking this medicine for six days now for possible prostatitis and feel I can't take it anymore due to severe side effects.  24 hour/day diarrhea is the worst I've ever had.  Felt quite bloated and cramped with general abdominal pain.  Also had a few headaches, which I never have, and had flu like symptoms after day four.  Also had difficulty concentrating with some dizziness.  Food had no taste, except for sweeter foods like juice.  Wake up at night every hour or so to pee and feel very thirsty.  No way could I go to work or travel while taking this drug.    I can usually tough out most any drug side effect, but the general feelings of despair and even suicidal thoughts scare me.  Will be calling the pharmacist today for advice.",Charley

9,Doxycycline,Prostatitis,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2020",4,"Took a two week course of two doxycycline 100mg a day of a six week regime.First week fine and underlying condition of prostatitis improved.Second week awful -- severe flu like symptoms without a fever. Loss of appetite. Poor concentration. Severe abdominal and flank pain.Unable to continue course due to the dreadful side effects. Symptoms resolved having stop medication. Two days after ceasing medication, the extreme side effects recurred akin to allergy symptoms. Side effects included severe flu like symptoms without a fever, itching on my face, ears and hairline, thrush in mouth, anus and genitals, swollen lymph glands in armpits, loss of appetite and poor concentration. Side effects improved gradually after two to three days and were alleviated to some extent by Nurofen.I generally have a low tolerance for antibiotics but advise everyone to be extremely weary of doxycycline. There are lots of recorded cases of patients having similar experiences.",UK Runner

11,Doxycycline,Prostatitis,2,,"June 13, 2018",3,"Was prescribed empirically for prostatitis. After 1-2 days, thought I was dying. Blood felt toxic, severe cranial pressure, could not get out of bed. Almost called 911. Tried a few more rounds with food, definitely helps to take with food, but still not great. Switched to Zpack and virtually had no symptoms and it actually worked a bit.I later found out I have a different bacterial infection, wondering if Doxy made it worse by weakening my gut flora and immune system.Nasty stuff.",Hatemeds
12,Doxycycline,Prostatitis,7,,"November 8, 2017",14,Moderate Prostatitis:  Doxy working after a slow first 3 weeks. On week 6 now.  Don't stop too soon if its working.

They quickly dealt with the main symptom, very painful urination.  Having not noted the warning about exposure to sunlight, I went out in the sun and suffered, firstly, severe itching of the scalp; followed by reddening of the scalp and nose.
