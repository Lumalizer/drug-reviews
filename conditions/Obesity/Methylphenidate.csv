0,Methylphenidate,Obesity,6,,"February 11, 2012",43,I was put on Ritalin by my doctor for weight loss. This is very helpful however it does make me very hungry when it wears off. My concentration is great and my workouts are more intense because this medication. It gives me more energy and makes me more focused and makes me feel like I can lift more then I usually do. I have become more mellow and no longer yell at my family when I am upset. They love me on this medicine because I am very calm and don't get upset easily. So far I have lost 10lbs in 1 week but I do hit the gym everyday. I have not had any other side effects from the medicine.,fatgalnomore
