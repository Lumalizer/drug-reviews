0,Qsymia,Obesity,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 16, 2022",0,"Took the 2 week starter dose. It made me feel lethargic and apathetic. I didn't feel like exercising. I would have been content to spend the day in a chair. I lost 4 pounds changing nothing. I think it was water weight. I then took the next dose for one week. I got terribly constipated with abdominal pain. I lost no weight on the increased dose. It did not change my appetite and it took away my energy. I stopped taking the drug after 3 weeks total . 61 year old woman, 5 foot 3 180 pounds.",DNW

2,Qsymia,Obesity,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 15, 2021",1,"Qysmia helped me lose 10 pounds in  5 months. My doctor started me out on the lowest dose and it increased to the highest dose. The side effects I had were tingling in my hands and feet and sometimes fatigue. At my last doctor visit, she and I decided I could try this journey on my own to see how I will do. Shoot, I gained 4 pounds back in one week!!! I'm still on the same diet and exercise program. I have read a lot of success stories on this site and I wish everyone that has a positive story much luck!! No hard feelings... It just wasn't for me.",Dissatified

4,Qsymia,Obesity,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 23, 2020",36,"I gave Qsymia multiple chances as it seemed to work on the outset. In January 2017, I started on the trial, gradually moved up to the maximum dosage. I then had to stop due to the expense. I lost 20 lbs in 8 weeks. I gained lost weight back.In April 2019, I started again on the drug, this time at full strength. I lost about 30 lbs in 8 weeks. However, being on antidepressants (citalopram/Celexa) for depression, I believe Qsymia caused me to have suicidal thoughts and actions. I discontinued the medicine in July 2019 because of these suicidal thoughts. I was prescribed a new antidepressant (fluoxetine/Prozac) which boosted my mood considerably for a few months afterward. I gained all weight lost back.In April 2020, I tried Qsymia one last time as my weight was back up. Still on fluoxetine, within 3 weeks, my depression worsened and the suicidal thoughts came back. After stopping the medicine for two days, the thoughts seemed to dissipate.",Sardonicus

My starting weight was 238lb and six days later my weight was 221.lb The first couple of days I had very low energy and felt a little groggy but I had to learn to force myself to eat because I don’t have an appetite. I do have slight blurred vision at times. I feel like it’s worth it for the weight loss. I have dry mouth as well. I have done absolutely no exercise at all but plan to start.,Jackie

7,Qsymia,Obesity,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 6, 2019",27,I take the medications separately so my insurance will cover the Topamax. I take 37.5 of the Apidex and am on 25 mg of the Topamax. I have been on the Topamax for 9 days. I am very pleased with this medicine as I have lost four pounds so far. It makes soda taste horrible so I have not had soda for 9 days. That is where 300-600 calories a day was coming from. If the medicine does nothing else it is worth it to kick my soda addiction. The only other side effect I have is being tired. I still have cravings for sweets and my appetite has been the same. I will be increasing my dosage to 50 mg in 5 days. I am hoping that will cause my cravings for sweets to cease.,Soda Addict
8,Qsymia,Obesity,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 4, 2019",45,"It started off slowly and at one point I thought it was doing nothing but a couple of week’s I could feel and see the change. Hunger became minimal and from there the pounds literally in my case fell off.  I started out at 262lbs and I’m down to 209.4lbs in 3 months (yes 3 months). The weight loss is not just because of Qsymia but it definitely helped, I also rode my peloton (exercise)  pretty much every day and also stayed away from white carbs. So would I recommend Qsymia as part of diet/weight loss plan absolutely, it definitely helps it takes away the hunger in between in meals.",Steven
9,Qsymia,Obesity,8.0,,"July 17, 2019",50,"I have been on Qsymia now since last May of last year, it is now July. I have now lost a total of 62 pounds. I have always been a bit heavy hovering around 185/190lb but ballooned to about 252lb due to my Thyroid issues getting out of control. The biggest side effects for me have been brain fog, and sleeplessness.   I read an article that said they are testing the drug for use on other addictive behaviors as well. I  have a lot of energy. Some people have reported mood swings, but I have always been moody so I cannot comment on this. Some days I forget to take my meds and I've been on the drug so long I do not find myself hungry or even thinking about food. The drug made food with sugar taste bad which means I rarely reach for anything sweet now or that is carb heavy. I find myself interested mostly in protein or salty foods when I do decide to finally eat.",evilelf
10,Qsymia,Obesity,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 13, 2019",40,"I began Qsymia on June 23 and have lost 11 lbs in 3 weeks. I have experienced side effects such as pins/needles in my hands and insomnia at night if I take it too late in the day, along with dry mouth. However, the medication has allowed me to reduce my appetite, not crave food and make most foods taste bland. I have found myself on several occasions spitting food out because the taste is not there. I started at 180 and am currently at 169. I believe I could have actually done better, but I do force myself to eat some days. It is a relief to not have a bottomless pit for a stomach.

11,Qsymia,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 5, 2019",80,"61 year old female, I started Qsymia, the 3.75 prescription the first week of April. Did that for two weeks then moved on to the 7.5 dosage. I started at 388 lbs and now weigh 332lb, lost 56 lbs in three months. I like it, there are side effects. Dry mouth and stuffy nose are the worst for me. I do also get occasional headaches. But it has totally taken away my appetite and my emotional eating as well as letting me control my sweet teeth. My doctor is letting me stay on it for another four months (and hopefully longer). I have been morbidly obese all my life. Had a gastric bypass 18 years ago and put most of the weight back on. This is the first time I have felt a glimmer of hope in feeling control over my eating habits. I wish everyone success in their endeavors and hope you give it a try.",Ptrsha

Within days I had tingling in my hands, feet and face. I had a memory fog where I had trouble finding my words and just seemed disconnected.  After another week I noticed I didn't have cravings, my appetite was less and I had dry mouth which helped me drink the 64 ounces of water daily. After one month on this medicine I only lost 1.6 lbs. Next visit to the dr. on 1/15/19 he added in Phentermine 15 mg. Weight seemed to come off a little faster and by 3/08/19 I hit my lowest weight of 256.2bl and that is where I stalled. After a month at this weight I decided to go off the medicine as I didn't feel the results I received out weighed the side effects I had. Today is 5/27/19 and I did gain 3-4 lbs. back since going off the medicine. Medicine just did not work for me.",Wanting to change

I keep taking Qsymia to maintain my weight. I sometimes go to one pill every other day but as soon as I start  gaining some weight (up to 4 pounds), I go back to one every day. Side effects I had eye and hand tingling for two or three weeks, permanent dry mouth, dry eyes, food tastes bad but you get use to it. My vision was getting worse and the ophthalmologist told me that it had nothing to do with the medication. Recently I have had blurred vision and eye pain that worsen this past weekend. I am calling my endocrinologist on Monday. I am going back to one pill every other day and probably stop the medication to see if that helps but I am concern that I will gain some weight.",JY

After having thyroid cancer, multiple surgeries, & medication adjustments I had gained 40 pounds in 2 years and it seemed like the gaining was never ending. The first couple of days I had a constant but dull headache which stopped after 3 days. Within the first week as many others noted, soda started to taste flat and like metal so I stopped drinking it. No other changes in taste though. The main concern for me is the taste of the actual pill. I gag so bad each morning when I take it. The smell and the taste is absolutely horrible, but it's doing it's job. I still eat whatever I want, but I am at the point now where I'm eating smaller sized meals as I can't finish my food anymore. Once I eat my first meal of the day, I'm normally not hungry again until that night.

16,Qsymia,Obesity,9.0,,"February 4, 2019",43,"Ive been on Qysmia now since July 2018 for about 7 months. I was prescribed the medication by my endocrinologist after a year of haywire thyroid problems. After being on Qysmia coupled with my daily thyroid meds I have lost 55 pounds!!The biggest side effects have been dry mouth, thirst, and constipation. Insurance pays for the Qsymia medication. If you can't get your insurance to do that, have your doctor prescribe it as the two separate meds phentamine and topmirate which separately are covered. Sugar does taste really bad like sand.I've had no heart or blood pressure issues. I also have a lot of energy. Also I read that they are doing research into this drug for use on other addictive behaviors other than just eating. One study said they were testing Qsymia on Alcoholics.

The doctor had put me in this medication a few years ago when I plummeted from 180 lb  down to 143 lbs in 4 month.  I was on the lowest dose & never increased as I didn’t need to.  I completely changed my diet, eating habits & exercised 4-5 times a week.  No side effects.  However, I started the medication again this Monday 9/10 & I am completely stunned.  I have side effects I had no clue were from the pills.  Due to my being overweight I was feeling depressed but I noticed just one day after talking the pill that I was even more depressed.  Crying for NO reason.  Day three I noticed insomnia, leg cramping & worst off is lack of concentration. It’s pretty frustrating actually.  I decided to skip today & start again tomorrow to see if it’ll help.  Due to my previous positive experience with this medication I am willing to give it another chance.",Deedi
18,Qsymia,Obesity,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 20, 2018",13,"This is an update on the comment below.  I was  diagnosed with ADHD about 12 years ago but stopped taking my medication for it many years ago because it made me feel jittery.  I have noticed, since I started Qsymia, that my ADHD is under control!   With no jittery feeling and it works better than the previous meds did. This is not used as a med for ADHD to my knowledge but it should be investigated.     Previous comment: I started Qsymia 5 days ago and am down 3 pounds.  I am able to control my portions and snacking very well and am not very hungry.  This is the low dose also.  I had previously been on Contrave for 2 months which made me extremely nauseous and I gained 8 pounds on it because I wanted to eat when I was nauseated.  The only side effects I notice are insomnia and restless legs at night.  Unfortunately,  I am unable to exercise because I broke my patella a week ago, so that may slow down my progress some.  Overall, this seems like a good medication.",Taz

The cost of Qsymia is a negative and so are the multiple side effects, but after leveling off after a month or so of experiencing them and following a low carb diet, it has been worth it!",Jessica Marie

Foods do taste different. Sodas taste like metal, rice and bread taste like cardboard, and anything other than a salad, lean grilled, broiled or steamed meats or fruits taste rather nasty. One thing is for sure, AVOID ANY DRINK WITH ASPARTAME IN IT, it will give you a monster headache and really make the tingling numb feeling really noticeable.
