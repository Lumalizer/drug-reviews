I dread warm weather and not being able to use loads of layers as my ‘comfort blanket’.I reached my heaviest during lockdown and started back on exercise and keto/low carb diet, but after 4 months I wasn’t seeing any results. I started Saxenda on the 0.6 dose. I’m happy to say, I’ve lost 6.2lbs in one week!  The first 3 injections made me feel a little queasy, but I wasn’t too sick. I felt like I needed to rest up. The effects were immediate and it has just turned off cravings and snacking. I just don’t want any rubbish food anymore. It’s quite amazing really. I just haven’t thought about food that much, and I used to plan my day around shopping for food, cooking it and enjoying it! It’s what I need to help me get to a healthy BMI as I approach my mid 40s…",43uk

I gained 30 pounds when I went through menopause. I have a BMI of 34; had all the side effects, nausea, vomiting, severe acid reflux.  Started slowly and every time I advanced my dose the symptoms worsened and then subsided.  I was on Saxenda and never lost any weight.  I had no appetite as I could not eat without getting sick.  I tried taking it in the morning and then at night before bed thinking a different time of day would help.  I achieved no weight loss and lost sleep from the acid reflux.",MLR70

I do not find that it lowers my appetite at all. Last year the Doctor had me try Ozempic which was very successful for me for approximately 6 months then it stopped being as effective. Since then I have tried other medications but nothing has worked. My side effects are mostly rapid heart rate and a slight headache but no stomach issues.,EmmaL

All my favourite things just don't interest me at all and I couldn't even face the smallest bite. Really weird. Horrible vomiting the other night and constantly nauseated with heartburn too. Popping pills like smarties. Hope this passes in a day or two. Can't continue like this much longer.,Gill
8,Liraglutide,Obesity,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 30, 2021",3,"Saxenda (liraglutide):Expensive, BUT, I lost 16 stone on my own, diet and exercise, over 18 months and put it back on after injury, and after trying to get started again I’m BACK. 50lb down, 35 during saxenda in 10 weeks. Awful taste, terrible constipation and thirst and headaches, BUT no real cravings. And if I want a meal I can have it; I just don’t eat as much. It is worth it if you have tried and failed to lose weight, and if you can cope with the side effects. I’m feeling far more mobile, fairly stable mood wise but you do have to help yourself. I’ll start some light exercise, and I need to eat the right type of food or I don’t lose, but it does work!",Jane
9,Liraglutide,Obesity,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 28, 2021",8,Saxenda (liraglutide):I started on Saxenda September 1/21. I went for my one month check yesterday and I’m down 14 lbs. I take the minimum dose 0.6. I don’t feel that I need to increase it as I’m happy and content with no cravings. I take my dose at night  half an hour before I go to bed. I’ve never had any kind of side effects from this medication. I make sure that I take a good multivitamin…drink lots of water and follow the daily nutrition guide.  I walk half an hour 5 days a week on my treadmill and I don’t eat anything after 6pm. I’m totally happy with this medication and highly recommended it to anyone who’s been a yo yo dieter like myself.,Gillian
10,Liraglutide,Obesity,10.0,,"September 26, 2021",4,"Saxenda (liraglutide):So far so very good. Throughout 6 years in depression, grief and trauma I gained 20kg. I had become highly addicted to large amounts of processed sugar in any form. I tried for 3 years of the 6 to go cold turkey off the sugar and have integrated regular exercise and weight training but by 3 weeks my brain was screaming out to eat sugar. I am in my 5th week on Saxendra and sugar free, I’ve lost 4-5kg and only taking 1.8 mls daily of Saxendra. I am using it along side healthy whole foods with less exercise as I don’t have energy for 2-3 hrs at the gym eating less. I am 55 and love that I don’t have the speedy feeling from other suppressants, I am wanting to wean the receptors of my brain off sugar. Just like I did with nicotine a few years ago I’m determined not to eat sugar to start the whole addiction process off again and regain the weight.",Monique

12,Liraglutide,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 20, 2021",22,"Saxenda (liraglutide):I've read through the other reviews and feel sorry for the people experiencing severe side effects. Makes me wonder if it's a result of using the maximum 3mg dose from the start?.I will say that my experience wasn't free of side effects. Started off on 0.6mg per day. Just sipping water or thinking about food caused me to vomit violently, I mean; I wouldn't be surprised if my boots flew out my mouth. First two days was a struggle just to stay hydrated. Day three I started to feel ok. I had to struggle to eat a bowl of soup. By day 7 I could eat a bowl of soup and some toast. Due to the side effects, I stayed on 0.6 for a fortnight before moving up to 1.2mg.Now I'm on the full 3.0mg dose with no side effects at all. I am satisfied with a bowl of cereal for breakfast, one sandwich for lunch and 170g steak and a small amount of vegies for dinner would be a feast. Losing 2kg/5lbs per week. At week 10 lost 25kg/55lbs",Peter Ando

I experimented with taking it at night, midday, and morning. For some reason my body likes the morning. I had terrible nausea and headaches. But if I take it in the morning then that either doesn't happen or happens while I'm asleep later on. I've been walking 60-90 minutes per day in the morning. I don't use a scale so I don't know for certain my starting weight and current weight. Probably started around 95kg (165 cm). I feel lighter. I can walk farther and faster. I don't get out of breath. My chest is slightly smaller. Face looks slightly thinner. I'd guess that I've lost a kg or two in the short time that I've been on it. I have to eat small meals. I can't really eat a ""meal"" like I used to. Just snacking on fresh veggies and a cracker every now and then to settle my stomach. White fish, spinach, etc. No cravings for sugary foods or alcohol. My skin looks more radiant. I pay only 50 gbp per month for the saxenda pen",pathfinder

16,Liraglutide,Obesity,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 28, 2021",5,"Saxenda (liraglutide):41 y/o female, 344 lbs starting weight. 6 weeks taking Saxenda and I’ve lost 17 lbs. I have struggled with obesity my whole life. I’ve found this medication challenging to take, but it works and I’m going to see it through. The nausea and headaches in the first few weeks were super rough. That calmed down and was replaced with constipation and diarrhea for several weeks, which was pretty awful at times. It seems to have leveled off now, but I do still get uncomfortable if I eat too much. I lost a lot of weight in the first few weeks and then started plateauing, but I’m trending down again. This stuff works—I find it very helpful in keeping me on smaller portions and craving healthier foods. My goal is get into the comfortable habit of eating less and eating better and not wanting to over indulge. I’m addicted to the pleasure of food and that is a tough cycle to break. Hopefully the worst of the side effects are over now.",Mscre8

I'm 43 year old male and started at on the 0.6 dose, and ramped up and stayed at 1.8 so far. I intermittent fast overnight and drink water and coffee until lunch. I can stay under 2000 calories daily without issue. Lunch is around 500 calories, maybe a snack mid afternoon of 100 calories, and dinner is around 800-1000 calories. Lots of water, no real side effects other than occasional constipation (fiber pills help with that within a day). I hit the treadmill between 60-90 mins daily, and lift weights every few days.  This gets me weight loss of about 1-2 lbs a week, which my doctor says is about the right pace.  I've been able to halve my blood pressure meds as a result of all this.The big benefit is I don't binge eat and can maintain intermittent fasting everyday. No urges to eat after a meal, and most importantly I don't feel the need to eat after dinner. It's been a game changer for me so far.",SaxendaUser

20,Liraglutide,Obesity,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 18, 2021",8,"Saxenda (liraglutide):On week 3 this coming Tuesday and lost 8.2 lb. I used to be a runner, stopped due to injury and put on 2 stone. I do weight training but no cardio. My BMI hit 27 and I felt so miserable. Uk private prescription service cost £55. The first day I accidentally overdosed as I didn’t feel the injection so assumed I had messed up, and did another one. Big mistake - felt rough and threw up. Since then, I have stuck to the 0.6mg, at the rate I am dropping I won’t increase the dose. Slight headache but the weather is hot ATM and I should drink more water. Starting to fit into my clothes and my confidence is back, next goal is to start running again. Once I regain enough fitness to sustain a good pace/distance I plan to come off Saxenda. I won’t rule out a short cycle on it in future, for me it has kickstarted my weight loss when all else has failed. I felt I was climbing Everest trying to lose the weight with diet and gym as the progress was often slow to nothing! Now I feel it is less overwhelming!",HG

I just feel awful, I have not gotten nauseous or anything like that I’m eating just fine my appetite is normal. I just feel so weak. I don’t know if it’s some sort of an ingredient in it or a stimulant and that’s doing this because sometimes coffee makes me jittery and I have like a caffeine sensitivity. I don’t do well with stimulants. But my neighbor took it and did great on it and is losing weight feeling great and I’m over here looking sick and feeling awful.

26,Liraglutide,Obesity,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 7, 2021",1,Saxenda (liraglutide):Disappointed with Saxenda as I am on my third week and  I've only  lost 2lbs.  I feel sick in the afternoons which is ok as it stops me eating too much but clearly I'm still able to overeat as I've only lost 2lbs.  I can't see how everyone else is losing lots of weight but not me.  I started at 202lbs and I'm 5ft 9in.  I'm going to keep going for another few weeks to see if there's any shift but I feel gutted that I'm not losing weight.  It's costing me a lot of money and if I don't see results after the time the last pen is used then I'll stop using it.,JayBeee
27,Liraglutide,Obesity,5.0,,"July 4, 2021",2,"Saxenda (liraglutide):I was using 2.4 but now up to 3 mg, the correct dosage, and have lost 20 lbs right away and think I’ve lost another 10. It stops the hunger but I’m dehydrated and results from  blood tests I’m also in stage 3b chronic kidney disease. I don’t know if it’s related but started about the same time I started using Saxenda. But I’m on other meds as well for a chronic illness. I’m going to stop because my insurance stopped paying after 2 years and my one month free coupon. It’s very expensive. My Dr told me if I didn’t learn proper eating habits I’ll gain back the lost weight. I can’t as I have high BP & now CKD. It’s too bad there’s no more oral pills or I would take that again to maintain weight. I should’ve got bariatric surgery but now my BMI isn’t enough to get it so I would gain back then get the surgery. I can’t understand why we can’t have weight loss drugs for us with obesity. Rating midway due to how expensive. Is it safe though? IDK.",Sara20
28,Liraglutide,Obesity,9.0,,"July 1, 2021",7,"Saxenda (liraglutide):No diets worked: weight would come back immediately and bring some friends. So I decided to begin intermittent fasting 3-4 days a week on liquids only on December 2020 when I weighed 207lbs with close to 50% of body fat. I lost 5-7 lbs per week but they would come back when I ate, even though followed 1200 calorie fiber rich diet. In February 2021 got prescription for Saxenda and it changed my life. Before Saxenda energy levels were really down and I felt like dying after each meal. Saxenda made me want to eat less and I couldn't stand desserts (I've been a sweet tooth all my life) and manage hunger easier on the fasting days. For 2 weeks I paused intermittent fasting: with following 1200 calories diet the weight wouldn't come back but also wouldn't drop. 6 months I did fasting, exercise and nutrition plan beside Saxenda which helped to stabilize achievements. I am more energetic and don't feel crushed after meals. I lost 50lbs in 6 months and continue with Saxenda assisting my efforts.",DevoutFerret

I feel good, and my stamina for exercise has increased.  My blood pressure has dropped significantly, so my doctor and I reduced my blood pressure medication by half.

After that I was weak the next day (lack of sleep from night before). That was the only issue I've had so far.I eat very small meals and have post 10 pounds in two weeks.

Lost 3 lbs; like the others above, constant craving & binge eating went away like magic! Including coffee aversion. Upped the dose to 1.2 mg; by day 5 I had severe GI issues - woke up in middle of night to vomit, constant diarrhea, burps that smell & taste like rotten eggs. Sat in bed sick & did not eat for 4 days. Because I have kids & full time job, these side effects are a deal breaker for me. Either they had to go, or Saxenda had to go. Talked to my doc & dropped the dose back to 0.6 mg, which I will stay on for 2 more weeks before trying the 1.2 mg dose again. I never got to the peak dose of 1.8 mg and am not sure my body can tolerate.  After 25 days I lost 10 lbs, but it may be because I ate almost nothing for 10 days of feeling sick.

Saxenda has taken away all of my sugar cravings and has helped me eat smaller portions.  The only side effect for me has been nausea.  It was pretty tough in the beginning but as my body has adjusted to the drug, it is now very mild if at all.    Since I'm not eating nearly as much, I make sure when I do eat, it is good food - (lean protein, fruits, vegetables) and not junk food.  Since Saxenda has stopped the sugar cravings, it has been extremely easy to eat for nutrition.  Also, prior to beginning Saxenda, I began a daily fiber regime so I wouldn't have bathroom issues.  In short, I had just about decided that I was just going to be an old, fat woman who has just given up.

They charge $499.99, so basically $500.00 for a box of 5 pens, so 30 days' worth of medicine. $500 is still pricey for 30 days coverage of a maintenance medication that didn't help me lose the full amount of weight I needed to lose AND requires daily injection of a shot into areas of fat that leaves bruising.

My stomach only wants light foods now and  the thought of fast food like McDonald’s makes me want to barf. All meat actually. So needless to say eating has become difficult. I’m not hungry and only on 0.6 daily in tummy. Yesterday I couldn’t think of anything I would be willing to eat. So I got some rocket goat cheese and avacado with a nice dressing. I felt there was too much dressing and couldn’t eat it after 2 bites. That was my meal for yesterday. I did get up at 12am out of boredom and make a protein shake. That hit the spot. I’ll have a another today and go on liquid diet I think. I’m also doing keto so choices are even slimmer. I’m down 8kg from keto in 2.5 months and from Saxenda I’m not sure maybe I’ll attribute 2kg to it.,Jomamamama

Side Effects of Saxenda (for me) was nausea, slight headaches, and the feeling of nausea when eating anything sweet, and severe constipation. My Provider advised me to take one cap full of Miralax with 8oz of water each day to keep the constipation at bay. No constipation after beginning this daily regiment.

It's been very difficult to function so I would think twice before trying this drug if you have a demanding lifestyle. I've stuck to a fairly healthy diet - calorie controlled, fairly low fat with a wide range of foods but small portions and no eating after 7pm and LOTS of water.  Weight loss has been slow but acceptable and I am going to stick to as low a dose as possible as I am convinced my tiredness and nausea can only get worse on the higher doses.

For me that was amazing as I was prediabetic and also take other medicines that contribute to weight gain and insulin resistance. 10 days ago I found out that I was pregnant, despite being on the contraceptive pill. I’ve had to stop the injection immediately as it’s not safe for use pregnancy. Well, my appetite seems to have returned with a mighty thud. I was struck down with gastroenteritis for two days then started eating again. I’ve had a few naughty things but have been continuing on the SlimmingWorld plan which isn’t anything to worry about. In 11 days I’ve put on half a stone!!! I’ve read through the reviews but can’t find anything about putting weight on after discontinuing the jab. Is there anyone out there that can offer some advice?

I am simply never hungry. A few things from my experience:- If your current dose is working, wait to increase until you feel it less effective. When I tried going up faster, the side effects were worse. I am actually still at 2.4 and it is working great. Since I am paying for this out of pocket, I am thankful I can extend the use.- I would say my side effects have been manageable. However, they are disruptive to my life. I always feel like I have a lump in the back of my throat, like I might get sick, and my stomach always has a mild icky feeling...its ALL the time. - Anything with onion or garlic gives me heartburn.... and they never use to- Don’t over eat, you will pay for it!!I will check back in a few weeks.",Mcjodie

But after 5 weeks on Saxenda l have gone from 182 to 160. I was super nauseous and taking OTC meds for that, gradually just drinking ginger ale as my body becomes accustomed to full dose. Appetite is virtually gone, as is my craving for sweets. I’ve not started regular exercise yet but plan to. Not sure how if it’s relevant but at week 3 I stopped taking an SSRI (Zoloft) —that drug was basically why I gained 60 lbs in 18 months. I’m about halfway to my weight loss goal and feel elated with and grateful for this drug. The price is shockingly high ($1500 for 3 boxes of 5 pens each, plus needles) for a 3 month supply—but I’d spent nearly that much during the past year on other weight loss methods (without results).

Only lasting side effect is dry mouth, but I keep water nearby constantly. One thing to mention is that Saxenda takes away the physical 'urge' to eat, but it doesn't resolve the psychological triggers for eating. My trigger for overeating is boredom. Saxenda gave be the ability to focus on this and develop strategies for dealing with it. That has made my time on this drug invaluable.

I had an immediate reduction in appetite from the start, and cut calories to 1,000-1,200/day. I feel satisfied with that. I focus on fresh (no sugar, low carbs) and keep the fiber and water intake high so I’ve remained regular. I've noted that I 'pay' for eating too much at a meal with a stomach ache, since stomach emptying is slowed. I've also noticed a slight increase in systolic BP (still ok). The last issue is that I actually lost interest in food completely a couple of weeks ago. I had to purposefully go shopping to find 'yummy foods', and managed to re-kindle my interest. Net is that this is a good med, but you need to listen to your body while you're taking it, and write everything down that you're putting in your mouth while you're on it.

My advice is to make sure that you keep yourself well fed with several small portions a day, see nutritionist, and follow the docs orders. The first two days I dealt with extreme waves of nausea that lasts about an hour each time. I realized that I wouldn't lose weight, gain weight or have nasty side effects if I didn't keep myself full. I had several health issues occuring that required me to be on steroids, so I didn't lose as much weight as I could have lost. I will keep working hard and start exercising.

Once I stopped eating that stuff, I have gone without the gas, the throwing up and burping side effects. In addition, the side effects are not gone because my body is used to the medication.

She agreed so I did a 1.8 and a 1.2 shot each morning. Side note- I work overnights. I take my meds in the AM (also on Lexapro that made me tired.

It has been an up and down journey. With the advice of my health care team I have slowly increased my dosage over a longer period. I am only at 1.8 mg and am presently having mild side effects such as tiredness and indigestion. I take a antacid before going to bed which helps curb the acid reflux. I've been told to have smaller meals more often. I find having sweets causes more of the indigestion problem.  I try to do some form of activity everyday even if it is just a walk. I try to keep my expectations reasonable and consider Saxenda just another tool in my weight management. I find the other posts very helpful.,Terry Lu

If you think you are going to eat bad things and still lose weight you are only kidding yourself. Things to stay away from are of course anything with flour or sugar, no bread at all, no red meat,and definitely no soda or alcohol. You need to learn how to eat while on the medication because you will need this knowledge when you get off of it.  Make water with lemon slices your new friend!",hov422

My starting weight was 194lbs and I'm now at 189. Not so fantastic, but not awful either. I am nauseated most of the day, which gets worse around 6pm, then fades. Overall, I feel that the best part of this med is that I don't care about food. At all! I'm a donut lover, and when my family brought over a dozen fresh donuts, I had one bite and felt sick. I didn't even want it. That is amazing. I'm not obsessed with food anymore. Most days I have to force myself to eat.

I actually feel very good already and it's making me really happy noticing little changes to my body that have come with losing 12lbs! I hope the weight loss continues. It's fabulous.",AmeliaLily
932,Liraglutide,Obesity,,,"October 14, 2011",1,"I started Victoza 3 days ago. I had read so many side effects that I was really afraid of taking it. I am very high diabetic borderline and have to do something. Since it has been only 3 days, I know it will take time for me to lose weight but I am excited about the sugar levels and my weight dropping. Have tried every diet in the book.....I hope I have finally found something that will help....Will keep you informed.",Barb49
933,Liraglutide,Obesity,10.0,,"October 6, 2011",88,"Victoza (liraglutide):I take this medicine for weight loss only. I am not a diabetic...lost about 20lbs in about four months. The first month saw the most weight loss. I now lose about 4-6 lbs a month. I am happy that I am still losing weight...the only side effect I have had is a random headache but that started when I upped my dosage to 1.8. Yes, the medicine came with some side effects, all drugs do...but you need to take it so see what side effects you may have since everybody is difference. Then you need to out weigh the pros and cons. For me I will put up with the random headache to keep losing the weight.",Anonymous
934,Liraglutide,Obesity,5.0,,"September 9, 2011",33,"Victoza (liraglutide):I am taking this medication due to pre diabetes, insulin resistant. I am taking it with metformin. I am up to the 1.2 dose after two weeks and I have lost about 3 lbs, however I feel really sick to my stomach and I have had headaches everyday. I am not hungry and food does not taste the same which could be a good thing. I find it hard to figure out what I want to eat and then I can never finish it because I get full faster. So I can see that this could be a really great way to lose the weight but when I test my sugar it's still at 160 so I am not sure if it is doing what its supposed to do. I am also having trouble sleeping, not sure if that is a side effect or not.",Pre-D in Pokey.

After trying Byetta which made me sick and not lose weight, my endocrinologist prescribed Victoza July 2nd.  I have lost 6 pounds, eat only when I need to, eat foods that are better for me and have NO NAUSEA at all. In 3 weeks I have already bumped up to 1.8mg a day.  I love this medicine and will stay on it until I go from my current 180 to 125.",cindyroo

This got worst when my MD upped the dose to 1.8, I think maybe I should go back a dose. I lose 5lbs in 4 weeks, but I haven't decided its worth since I am so fatigued I can't function on a normal level. Most days I can't even get out of my pajamas but it is the only sympton I have experienced. My MD said he had not heard this complaint from any other patient.",Anonymous
938,Liraglutide,Obesity,9.0,,"June 14, 2010",162,"Victoza (liraglutide):Been on Victoza for 6 weeks now (along with Metformin) for insulin resistance and weight loss.  Have lost 17 pounds so far, 25 more to go. Started taking the Victoza in morning and had nausea 8-10 hours after injecting. Switched to taking it at 4 or 5 pm and now sleep through nausea.  Definitely suppresses appetite.  Feel satisfied eating like a normal ""thin"" person now.  Have more frequent headaches but ibuprofen takes care of that.  Very thankful to my gynecologist for sending me to an endocrinologist for help.  It's so liberating to think my weight problems are not just because I'm weak and have no will power!  There's a physiological reason it's been so hard for me to lose weight! Very happy with this medicine.",Junebug48
