Prescribed by the GP, 5 stone to lose, let’s hope I keep seeing the losses.In terms of the dreaded side effects, mainly visit the loo in the morning after a coffee or two. As I’ve been following a plan of sorts I’ve had nothing unpleasant other than orange poop, it does make me nervous though as if you don’t go and hold on you can get a bit of leakage",Cya
2,Orlistat,Obesity,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2022",0,"Alli (orlistat):I am reading all these great things about Ali and I’m so disappointed… I got so Very ill after I took it. I honestly thought I was going to die. I’ve looked for drug interactions and I can’t find any with the medication I take. I’m on an opiate pain reliever for my back. I took Ali with my lunch and felt like I got the flu within an hour body aches chills almost like I was withdrawing from my pain medication. But then I read and searched on the Internet and didn’t find any interactions so I took it again with my dinner . This time I broke into a sweat, profusely sweating had chills so bad that was violently shaking was so dizzy that I couldn’t even stand up I was nauseous, My muscles started cramping up and I couldn’t breathe…(I might have been panicking and I do have asthma ) and then after about two hours it went away again. It was a very scary experience and I thought about going to the hospital but I couldn’t even walk across the room to get to my phone.",Liza
3,Orlistat,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 10, 2022",12,"Take home message is that this tackle works, and works well. On the down side, had I known taking a bit of a gamble on an iffy fart whilst walking round Waitrose would turn out to be quite so catastrophic then I’d have taken drastic steps. I also wouldn’t have been wearing white rugby shorts. Low point in my life, the ignominy of having to dash to the toilet with turd-oil down my leg was the turning point. I quickly learned that the way to stop making the back of my boxers looking like a dropped lasagne was to stop eating the rammal that had turned me into a fat idiot in the first place. Within a few days, each fart became less of a gamble and each parting company on the toilet looked slightly less like I’d tipped a bucket of Sunny Delight mixed with 5w30 oil down it. Don’t get me wrong, it’s going to be a good while before I have the confidence to show any level of enthusiasm on the trumping front but I did manage this morning to do one I could hear without washing my gooch.",SuperLeeds

I mange to loose a stone and a half then it all plateaued and for my BMI I was still classed as obese.  I have only had minor sides effects due to only taking 1 a day in the morning ,I will slowly get it up to 3 if I need to. As a single mum I can't risk the side effects just yet. I have been on it for 6 days with making healthier choices and just walking as much as I can and have lost 3 pounds, so I'm very happy and do not feel the need to take more than one a day.

It’s a classic case of what came first, the chicken or the egg? I’m so terrified of the side effects I have eaten so well over the past few weeks. I track everything I eat on my fitness pal and I am careful that no meal is over 15g of fat. On the few occasions I have picked at something I shouldn’t, I see the side effects in the morning in the bathroom but certainly not to the dramatic extent some people are describing. Basically, by taking this you are forced to eat healthy or face the side effects. It’s really helped me to develop a much more consistent and healthy approach to food and I really hope that I keep that once I stop taking it.",Piffer2021

So I needed something to help a little more than most people to eliminate bad fat and flush it out. After just a day or two, I noticed it doing its job, and I actually feel a lot better too. I don't have that bloated or feeling too full feeling. I did make sure to start this on my weekend to make sure everything would go okay and I wouldn't have any accidents. I noticed as long as I follow the Simple Plan of lower calorie or lower fat diet, and just taking one with my higher fat meals, I haven't had any problem. Lost 3 lbs in 6 days so far, so actually pretty impressed. I also think this is a good product to take for those that are trying to lose weight with no gallbladder or going through menopause , those pounds that snuck up very quickly.",Mikki

A year later I still am experiencing the same side effects and am fatter than ever. I am hoping with enough time the gastrointestinal side effects will get better and I can have a solid stool.

I started them 4 months ago and have lost 19 pounds on the and 10 pounds before them. So a total of 29 pounds combined. They are not a miracle pill you still need to exercise and watch your fat intake. I allow myself max 15g fat per meal. I do have snacks when I want but the key in to be in a calorie deficit! And exercise. Then the tablets are gold dust. I’ve had some bad stomach cramps, messy moments but I only go once a day in the morning after my coffee. Some weeks you won’t loose or you might go up and that’s completely normal. Consistency is key and it will come off :) best of luck everyone",Criss

32,Orlistat,Obesity,10.0,,"January 16, 2021",97,"Alli (orlistat):I've had no side-effects and no weight lost after 3 months, so my Physician told me to stop taking the pills.  My labs all came back normal, so no thyroid, Cushings, etc.... it was so frustrating!!!  Then, because of the Covid, everything was telemedicine and I got a new Physician via Zoom call and she requested a new set of labs and told me I had pre-diabetic insulin resistance.  That changed everything!  My diet had to change yet again. I'm following more of a high veggie and low any type of carb diet, PLUS the Alli and I am *finally* losing those darn menopause pounds that, literally, sneak up on you.  What am I saying?  Take Alli to help with weight loss but if it doesn't work, you need to keep working with your Physician to get the right combination of diet & exercise for Alli to work.  For you pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women out there; keep at it!  The weight does, eventually, come off and you don't have to starve yourself or have risky surgery to do it.",Donna

50,Orlistat,Obesity,8.0,,"January 18, 2020",47,"Orlistat does work but you have to use it properly. I have had no bad side effects and it is really helping. Here are my top tips:1) Before you even take it, make sure you discuss with your gp to monitor your progress and health.2) Have a low fat & calorie diet at least a week prior to taking it. You can then iron out any clinks e.g. I am prone to late night binges so I made sure I put some extra emotional support in place and stocked the cupboard with healthy low fat snacks.3) Make sure you have got some low fat ingredients and recipes to hand. The following I have found super useful:Low calorie cooking sprayReduced fat hummus and cheesePitta breadCrumpets with a tsp of peanut butterFruit and vegBeans, pulses and legumes: make these your best friend.4) Keep hydrated with water.5) Take a multi-viatmin either first thing in the morning or eve.",Jaz

Avoid high fat foods as much as possible while taking this, wear a panty liner during the day and an overnight pad at night. That's not just a ""girl"" thing. Anyone can buy pads and if you don't while taking orlistat you better buy some back up underwear in bulk. It may not be pretty, but neither is weight loss.

I was taking them three times a day. One with every meal. I had been on a super low cal/fat diet since December of 2015 and since then I have lost 52lbs in about 4 months. Orlistat made me lose 10lbs the first week I was on it but after that I found it really slowed down. I decided to rely mostly on my diet and exercise more then taking the pills. My doctor still prescribes them to me and said he will continue to do so until I stop losing weight. However I now will only take them with a meal that has a higher fat content as I eat so little fat most of the time. However definitely worth trying to amp up weight loss!",ABgal

It blocks a certain amount of the fat you eat from being aborbed into your body and thus reduces your calorie/fat intake. It's not a miracle drug, if you eat a very high fat diet yes it may help a bit but it won't do ALL the work.Also, if you eat little/no fat anyway it can't help as it won't do anything for you. It can't block fat that isn't there. If like me you're on a long term diet it can really boost your success. I have gone from a bmi of 47 to 39 in 6 months.

Let me just clear some stuff up for you. If you aren't a calorie limit diet, you still eat whatever you want and you hardly move a muscle then this drug is NOT for you. This isn't a magic pill that will make you lose weight overnight without any effort, you have to make the effort to exercise a little, moderate your food proportion and set a calorie limit every day. Xenical just absorbs the food's fats but it's YOUR JOB to make sure the fat intake is low so you won't have a bad time in the bathroom. 2 weeks ago I weighed 315 and that was my heaviest weight.
