0,Topiramate,Obesity,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2022",6,"Topamax (topiramate):I used food to fix everything in my life, my entire adult life. Have lived in a fat suit my entire adult life. 2-18-2022 (270lbs)  I was given Topiramate to try for weight loss because I was tired of trying stimulants that caused high blood pressure which I only needed to take yet another pill for. grrrrr.It has now been 11 days. I went to the same Dr. office, but to see the PT this time. Snuck over to the scale...(260lbs!)10 LBS in 11 DAYS!!!!WOW!!!!  I FEEL FREE OF THE SHACKLES OF FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU TOPIRAMATE",FINALLY FREE!
1,Topiramate,Obesity,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 23, 2022",2,"Topamax (topiramate):I started taking topamax after quitting seroquel because I gained 20lbs in 3 months from the seroquel. I lost most of the weight quickly, it made me not eat much by feeling full, even with foods I like, I just ate less of them. But I got extreme cognitive issues from it which has caused a lot of problems so I’ve stopped taking again. Even my own doctor called it dopamax. Pay close attention to your tasks to see if it affects you. I wasn’t even able to clean my house. Great to help with appetite in the short term if you don’t get side effects.",Dopey
2,Topiramate,Obesity,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 10, 2021",2,"I started Topiramate in September of 2021 at a dosage of 25mg once per night. I am now up to 200mg a day and I take both pills at the same time, both before bed. I was diagnosed with PCOS at the age of 15 and it has always been a struggle for me to maintain a healthy weight. PCOS is truly a tricky thing.I had never quite reached over 200 pounds until after having my son. Fast forward to two years after having him and having to go on a couple different anti-depressants and I was up to 224. Feeling more happy but more depressed at the same time (if that makes any sense?)I immediately got off the anti-depressants and called my psychiatrist. She put me on Topiramate. So far, I have been on the medication for 3 1/3 months and have lost around ten pounds. From going to where I was to seeing the scale go down at a healthy rate, has been truly beneficial to both my body and mind. The only side effects that I have been experiencing are the tingling sensations in both my hands and feet.",Ecanino
3,Topiramate,Obesity,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 26, 2021",0,Topamax (topiramate):I started topamax 25mg at night and lomaira 8mg in the day. All was fine with topamax until I hit the 1 month mark and my cycle came. I was passing a crazy amount of huge blood clots and had the heaviest period I had ever had in all my years so I stopped taking it. The bleeding was just horrible. Other than that I had tingling feet sometimes and it made me cranky the first 2 weeks.  It did curb my appetite but not sure if it or lomaira made me lose the weight.,Cupcake
4,Topiramate,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 10, 2021",2,"Amazing!!! Highly recommended, if you are struggling with your weight. Thanks to Topiramate, I have lost 11 kg’s in just over 8 weeks. I am on 100mg per day. I only have a little bit of weight left to drop, so I’ll probably stay on Topiramate for another 3 months or so. Side effects for me have been very mild, occasional tingling in the hands, feet and mouth, dry mouth, increased thirst and fizzy drinks taste flat/strange. No cognitive side effects what so ever like other people mention, but I think that may be more common with higher doses.  (I ticked no, insurance didn’t cover this drug, because I am in Australia and we don’t use insurance for drugs here that often, it only cost me about $14 for 60 50mg tablets).",kingboo94
5,Topiramate,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 13, 2021",6,I started taking it on 8/23/21 at 25mgs I was supposed to increase my dose to 100mgs but stopped at 75mgs because I began having the tingling sensation in my feet. I then actually dropped down to 50mgs because I realized I had no different reaction to appetite suppression from 50mg to 75mgs.  I have had no symptoms w7ile be under 100mgs. I definitely have a massive decrease in appetite while on 50mgs. I wake up wanting to eat but can go from breakfast until around 6pm without eating anything. I might think about food (I know some people mentioned they forget about eating- I don’t) but I don’t feel the NEED to eat. By 6-7pm I start feeling hungry. I’ll eat dinner but don’t tend to overeat. I don’t have a crazy craving for sweets like I used too. I used to be 110. Had babies went to over 170 now back down to 127!!! Also did not get the soda tasting flat or tasting horrible side effect which I was hoping for. Wanted to help kick the habit. I can’t drink it plain anymore because it almost burns. But tastes great still with food . Especially Pepsi zero. Oh well! I know everyone gets different side effects. I also love that I don’t get tension headaches which I used to get often in the afternoons.,Emmy83
6,Topiramate,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 3, 2021",5,Topamax (topiramate):Was prescribed for appetite suppression due to ADHD and disordered binge eating.  Have been losing weight finally after trying hard at everything and ruining it by binging. The suppression is moderate to mild. I can eat like a normal person or just one meal a day. I push my plate away when I’m full and so not get any urges to over eat until I’m uncomfortable. 50 mg a day at night before bed.Only side effects are pins and needles in door and fingers a half hour to an hour after space and it last for about 5-10 minutes.,MA
7,Topiramate,Obesity,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 30, 2021",9,Topamax (topiramate):This medication was actually prescribed to me by my psychiatrist because of my binge eating issue. I was very hesitant because at first taking this I didn’t notice a difference I’ve been taking it for almost the full four weeks now and it’s finally starting to work. My appetite is starting to be suppressed now and within the last week and a half I went from 220 lbs to 207 lbs! Crazy. I will admit I feel a little foggy but I’m also on abilify (which is another reason I got put on topamax the abilify makes my binging worse) and Wellbutrin so I'm normally a little foggy so it’s hard to tell if the topamax is causing it to be worse. Either way. It’s helping me with my binge eating and I’m actively losing weight.,Binge Eating
8,Topiramate,Obesity,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 18, 2021",4,I started taking Topamax in 2010 for migraine headaches. My doctor slowly starting increasing my dose to 100mg/daily. By the time I reached 50mg I noticed I had a hard time making simple choices. I did notice that I was losing weight and this is something I always struggled with so I looked past short term memory loss issues. By the time I made it to 100mg I was losing 10 pounds/month with no dieting. I was also repeating myself in conversation. I went from 175 pounds to 140 pounds in 8 months. The last straw for me was sitting down for a final exam in college and I could not spell the word SUGAR. I talked to my doctor and began weaning off over 3 months. Over six months I went from 135 pounds back to my 175. The memory loss slowly abated but now I felt depressed about the weight gain. I don’t know what happened to my metabolism during that period of time but I am a crossfitter/Peleton rider at least 5 days/week and watch what I eat.  It’s been 10 years and I haven’t lost it.,Trixie

Topamax says as a side effect could cause blindness and it’s true I still go to the doctor to monitor my eye sight to make sure the pressure is still coming down.

11,Topiramate,Obesity,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 7, 2021",54,"Ever since I gave birth to my son I haven’t been able to lose the weight I gained during the pregnancy.  I got pregnant at about 125 pounds, and had him around 185/190, I then got down to 155lb, and now I am currently 188. I finally decided to try to lose the weight and had no luck. tried every diet, drink, exercise program. I workout, diet and eat clean. I’m 5’5 and 22 years old. I was always a small person so this is pretty difficult for me. I’ve been on topamax for a few days now. I take 100 mg twice a day, once in the evening and in the morning. It makes things pretty foggy, I don’t feel comfortable driving, I get full very quick and don’t want to eat really. I’m constantly thirsty and my mouth is really tingly as well as my fingers and feet. I’m assuming most side effects will calm down in a few weeks. I’m willing to take it till the weight comes off.

After 6 years was put on Topiramate - 200mg per day. Dropped 50 pounds in about 6 months. Went off it, eventually gained the weight back plus another 30.14 years since the first time: Back on it, have lost 40 pounds in 3 months. Still need to lose around 60-75 pounds... The fibromyalgia turned out to be MS. Haven’t been able to exercise in 20 years. I miss that, badly... But since I have no metabolism, it’s either starve or take the Topiramate. I’ve never noticed any negative side effects... But then, my resting state is pretty messed up; it would be hard to distinguish any new negative stuff from the plethora of negative stuff I already suffer regularly. ;)",Scottie

It didn't even make me tired or sleepy, a side effect I would have welcomed. I discontinued it because it was giving me painful and disturbing pins and needles in my feet and legs at night. It wasn't worth waiting to see if I would lose weight further down the line. Plus I was fearful about the side effect I read about concerning vision.",Elly
15,Topiramate,Obesity,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 21, 2021",17,"I went on topiramate for migraine prophylaxis, but also expecting to benefit from weight loss. I've been taking it for 5 weeks, the only side effects I have experienced are some drowsiness the first 3 weeks or so, and hand and feet tingling which improve if I'm really well hydrated. My headaches have significantly improved and I've lost 13 lbs! I never crave anything sweet anymore, I'm able to chose healthier options when I'm hungry and I'm also able to stop eating once I'm satisfied. I'm usually an emotional eater, and I feel like a sane person eating and like I can have a healthy relationship with food while on this med. I'm also lucky my side effects have been really mild so far. I started with 25 mg at night and gradually escalated to 100 mg every morning and 50 mg every night.",CLM

I asked for Adipex but dr wants my blood pressure lower so she prescribed this. Today is only my first day so I decided to research. Reading these stories has me both excited and anxious. I am a recovering heroin addict. When I got clean and started methadone I gained about 60-70 pounds and am having a hard time taking it off since I still take 30mg of methadone daily. I work out anywhere from 1-5 days a week, depending on my schedule. I'm worried about the tiredness some people have experienced, because I do love to work-out. Also afraid of losing the ability to recall words, as speaking and grammar are my strong points. I guess we'll see. I  plan on getting on Adipex as soon as my dr says it's safe to do so.

18,Topiramate,Obesity,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 19, 2020",92,I was given this for sleep. I had not even heard of the weight loss aspect of this drug. Tonight I was looking at my pills to plan my vacation. The name didn't look familiar to me so I looked it up. One of the side effects was weight loss.  The funny thing is tonight some family members I had not seen for about 4 week came by and they both asked me how much I had lost. I had just put on a shirt that didn't fit me at all 1 month ago and it was baggy. I was really surprised it fit. So I thought I must have dropped weight. Tonight I got on the scale and I was down to 295 from 313 just 4 weeks ago. I had no idea why until I looked up this drug and then it made sense. I'm only on 25 mg tablets 1 per night. Now I'm looking forward to trying on all my old clothes tomorrow.,Stevo

I have only had to be on a dose of 25mg topiramate a day and it has hugely reduced my appetite so that I've been eating very small portions, and only wanted to eat healthy food, and I haven't been thinking about food all the time like I use to. I used to binge eat three times a day incredibly unhealthy and have unhealthy snacks like chocolate brownies, and spent around $90 a day on Ubereats. On topiramate I'm rapidly losing weight. I was told by my psychiatrist that I'd start on 25mg, after one week move up to 50mg then after another week go up to 100mg, and she told me all about the side effects especially memory loss. I haven't had any side-effects! Perhaps because I've only needed to be on 25mg! Plus, in Australia it's extremely inexpensive. This medication has been incredible and life-changing.

My overall health and well being is more important than losing weight.  I am very cautious and choose the right foods e.g., protiens, green veggies, lots of water, fruits and fiber.  I am sure to get proper rest to stay mentally sound.  Losing weight is good for me, but is taxing on my body and I am going to do what I have to in order to develop healthy long term habits (which take at least 30 days to develop).",Emyleigh1957
