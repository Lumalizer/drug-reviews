0,Bupropion,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 28, 2021",2,"I was on 300 mg  XL for depression and lost 30 lbs in 6 months. I took this dose for 1 year and went to 150 mg for a year & gained the weight back! (Not realizing it was from med dose decrease change) I have noticed an increase with depression also. My dr decided to decrease to 75mg instant release, which made me feel WORSE! Now have decided to switch back to 150mg XR and gradually increase to 300 mg XR. I was much happier & weight loss was a nice thing also!",VannnaWhite

3,Bupropion,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 3, 2021",23,My Dr switched me from paxil for anxiety to Wellbutrin for both anxiety and weight loss. I lost 50 pounds in a year taking 300mg once a day. 5 years later the weight is still off and I feel better than ever both physically and mentally. I love this drug and because it's so great for anxiety/depression I plan to take it for the rest of my life.,Cdmelty
4,Bupropion,Obesity,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 23, 2021",7,"I've been on 150 mg Wellbutrin XR for one year, prescribed as an add-on to 200 mg Lamictal (lamotrigine) for recurrent depression/mood disorder (possible bipolar II). Generally I feel pretty good, still have some lows every few months, and do not find it as effective as Lexapro in the past, especially not for anxiety or negative rumination. It has been amazing for my sex drive and ability to orgasm (I mean, AMAZING). But it has NOT decreased my appetite or caused weight loss AT ALL. I have gained at least 5 pounds - not that much, I admit (esp. compared to Lexapro which caused +30 lbs). But my appetite is out of control, and I find I binge eat (not in the shameful, disordered way, just that I eat way too large of portions, and while I know it's bad for me, I can't stop myself, just get so much PLEASURE from eating. I am not obese, just overweight. I'm afraid 300 mg would make the insomnia it causes worse, though, so I'm sticking with 150 for now & hope I don't continue to put on pounds.",ABB

6,Bupropion,Obesity,9.0,,"April 14, 2021",96,"I began taking Bupropion last week and began to notice its effect pretty quickly. The dry mouth side effect has been persistent but it weakens after a few days. It’s ability to suppress my appetite is quite powerful. For a long time I’ve relied on food as a coping mechanism for a variety of reasons, but this medication has quickly done away with my constant feeling of needing to eat or be full. It’s to the point where I almost forget to eat. This has begun to reflect on the scale. I’m down a few pounds in a few days and I expect I’ll continue to lose weight.One example of my experience is that I ate quite a heavy lunch the day of my writing this review and I have had no interest in food since then. This is not typical. I would have found myself hungry at some point in the evening. So it seems to also collaborate with food already in the body to keep binge eating from happening.Overall I am quite pleased with this medication.",Anon
7,Bupropion,Obesity,1.0,,"February 18, 2021",31,"My doctor prescribed Buproprion in combination with a few other medications as a means to help my obesity. It helped curb my appetite. However I became increasingly irritable and depressed. I have a stressful life anyway so I chalked it up to that for a while. The change was gradual at first. Then it suddenly seemed to get increasingly worse. It felt like I was on a timer counting down and I was going to put myself out of misery. It quickly escalated beyond my control. It was like I was a bystander and something else took over my body, mind and spirit.I was somehow able to break through to get help. I called the suicide hotline and was able to reach an understanding that it was the medication. I immediately stopped taking the medication and felt gradually normalized over about a week. After 1 day the suicidal thoughts were gone.",Lenny

10,Bupropion,Obesity,1.0,,"January 20, 2021",21,I was on Wellbutrin for just over a month.  I felt like I was on speed and I gained 15 lbs in one month.  It’s screwed up my body and now I just keep gaining weight no matter what I try.,Anonymous
11,Bupropion,Obesity,1.0,,"December 21, 2020",27,"I've been on and off, Bupropion for over a year, and each time I'm on them I become more hungrier than ever, it's disgusting to hurt myself with binge eating disorders, but this drug stimulates me beyond trying to get well.But off them and only on my Dex, without the mix of Bupropion, I am in my normal and healthy weight and most of all, active.I hate myself on Bupropion, and tonight I've made my final decision to never go back to them again, they've increased my depression, anxiety disorders, panic, PTSD, ADHD and more.I'm happy for the people who they agree with, because it would be great to feel free of some afflictions due to disorders.Too much weight gain for me, goodbye Bupropion for Ever.",Tina

Right away 1st day the food, sugar, breads, starch cravings STOPPED. I feel so HAPPY to where I had to ask myself... Wait, was i still sad/depressed prior to taking these prescriptions. I didn't think I was so unhappy anymore, however according to the way I feel now with so much energy, wanting to socialize, engage in activities, date and create more than I ever had in the past.  I question how much I  locked up, put off in truly dealing with all the deaths in my family?. I have lost 13 pounds in the 1st 7 days!.

In 1 year I have lost 95.6 pounds (with not a lot of exercise but I do eat healthier) and I'm no longer obese. This drug works great for some and not so great for others.

14,Bupropion,Obesity,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 8, 2020",46,I started Wellbutrin about a month ago due to my extreme depression. My doctor and I talked about keeping me on my anxiety/depression medication (lexapro) as well as starting wellbutrin. I was eating excessively before starting Wellbutrin and that was one of my concerns I shared with my doctor. I am on the 12hr slow release and it somewhat helps with my low energy levels / motivation just depending on the day. I was about 215lbs when I started and I’m currently down to 201. I lost 40lbs in 2017 and was 145lbs and then my anxiety and depression hit and that’s when I had a real increase in my weight gain.,lilbitdepressed

17,Bupropion,Obesity,3.0,,"October 3, 2020",52,"when I started taking bupropion 2 weeks ago I was actually already on a weight loss plan and losing weight but I was horribly depressed and had really erratic mood swings. I have always been an emotional eater but I was getting that under control and then I started bupoprion 150mg and I started to gain weight, like this medication made it much easier for me to eat more and not less. My face acne is awful and my anxiety is really bad. I'm not sure if these side effects go away but I find it really puzzling that most people claim that this med helps them lose weight. Does it matter if you're already obese/overweight? Does it only work for a certain weight range? I was 260 initially and now I'm 270. My mood has gotten better though,  but is it worth gaining weight and becoming even more obese? Not really",Emotional eater

I hope I can avoid diabetes, it runs in my family.  I'm worried about my hair thinning, if bupropion is causing that. Again I'm 62 and have had fine hair my entire life.

22,Bupropion,Obesity,,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 29, 2019",85,"I’ve been taking bupropion for several weeks now, and it definitely helps me to stay on top of moody, depressed feelings.   It’s helps the parts of my brain that I cannot control sync up with the common sense I’ve always harbored, regarding feeling grateful everyday.    Without the neurochemical adjustment projected by this drug, it is more difficult to control sadness, anxiety, and even rage.   Here’s to hoping the benefit continues!  I’ve gained 35 lbs over the last 18mos., so, I’m hoping the med can also help with my intense nighttime food cravings and motivation to exercise.",Kikatz

I have already a bad headache this afternoon and I'm pretty sure it's because of the medication. Other than that, I feel nothing special happening to me so far. I know it's too soon. I have mixed feeling about starting this new medication. I'm excited and scared at the same time. I'm taking this for weight loss intentions only but I suffer from anxiety and bipolar disorder so it will definitely help me all around I think. I had the energy to go to the gym this morning so that's that! :) I will definitely keep you guys posted eventually. I can't rate the medication yet since it's too soon yet.",Shrekpower

27,Bupropion,Obesity,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 26, 2019",215,I was originally prescribed 300mg wellbutrin XR as a true antidepressant. I have managed to completely stop smoking and I've lost over 20 pounds in about 6 months of taking my medication. I have seen most of the weight drop in the past couple of months. My only complaint is the headaches in the beginning for about a month. Tylenol knocked those out quickly though.,Katt
28,Bupropion,Obesity,9.0,,"May 21, 2019",292,"I was prescribed BUPROPION HCL SR 150 MG (once per day) for anxiety/depression as well as weight loss. Within days, it felt like the cloud had been lifted over my head, my mood was great & the FIRST DAY I took it, I noticed that I felt like I could eat and my brain and stomach knew when to stop. Even when I wanted to eat more, I just could not.  In the beginning, I had to cut my breakfast/lunch/dinner servings in half and I was totally satisfied! I lost 10 pounds in the first 6 weeks.  My advice is to keep a journal and track your progress! After 6 weeks, my doctor added TOPIRAMATE 50 MG TABLET 2 x per day.  In 7 months I’ve lost 28 pounds, which is very exciting for me! Unfortunately, I’ve hit a plateau & the appetite suppression no longer seems to be working so, my doctor is increasing my dose BUPROPION 300 XL to see if this will help. I’m hopeful as I’ve had such success with it up until now! I’ll try to update my progress in a few months.",Lo2150

30,Bupropion,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 10, 2018",181,"My doctor prescribed both Bupropion and Naltrexone for weight loss. I got the Bupropion first and started on it. It worked so well, I did not add the Naltexone until several months later. Day one, my cravings disappeared. It wasn't anything I actually ""felt"". It was just that I got snacks and forgot to eat them. After 10 months, I have lost 77lb and have had the added benefit of quitting a Diet Coke addiction. I added the Naltrexone after losing about 35lb because I was finding it harder to stop eating once I started. The Naltrexone has had some side effects. Some nausea, but I just cut the dosage and it went away. Also sciatic nerve pain. I still take some Naltrexone and as long as I don't take it more than about 3 days in a row before taking a break, it doesn't cause problems and helps me stop eating before I'm too full. I take the Bupropion every day with no side effects. I still have about 60lb to lose. If I still need it, though, I can and will take it. I want this weight gone for life.",Lana

I believe the Wellbutrin gave me the motivation to stick with the eating and exercise plan.  It may have also provided a pharmacological effect. I've since stopped using Wellbutrin due to it not being specifically recognized as a weight loss product, but rather as an antidepressant.  Choosing this product in assisting my weight loss categorized me as being depressed, and adversely affected my ability to obtain favorable life insurance premium rates. After using Wellbutrin, I was given Bupropion XL due to managed care requirements to switch to generic prescription.  I stopped taking Bupropion because it proved ineffective for me.",Anonymous
