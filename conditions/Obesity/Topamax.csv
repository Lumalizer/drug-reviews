0,Topamax,Obesity,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2022",6,"I used food to fix everything in my life, my entire adult life. Have lived in a fat suit my entire adult life. 2-18-2022 (270lbs)  I was given Topiramate to try for weight loss because I was tired of trying stimulants that caused high blood pressure which I only needed to take yet another pill for. grrrrr.It has now been 11 days. I went to the same Dr. office, but to see the PT this time. Snuck over to the scale...(260lbs!)10 LBS in 11 DAYS!!!!WOW!!!!  I FEEL FREE OF THE SHACKLES OF FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU TOPIRAMATE",FINALLY FREE!
1,Topamax,Obesity,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 23, 2022",2,"I started taking topamax after quitting seroquel because I gained 20lbs in 3 months from the seroquel. I lost most of the weight quickly, it made me not eat much by feeling full, even with foods I like, I just ate less of them. But I got extreme cognitive issues from it which has caused a lot of problems so I’ve stopped taking again. Even my own doctor called it dopamax. Pay close attention to your tasks to see if it affects you. I wasn’t even able to clean my house. Great to help with appetite in the short term if you don’t get side effects.",Dopey
2,Topamax,Obesity,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 26, 2021",0,I started topamax 25mg at night and lomaira 8mg in the day. All was fine with topamax until I hit the 1 month mark and my cycle came. I was passing a crazy amount of huge blood clots and had the heaviest period I had ever had in all my years so I stopped taking it. The bleeding was just horrible. Other than that I had tingling feet sometimes and it made me cranky the first 2 weeks.  It did curb my appetite but not sure if it or lomaira made me lose the weight.,Cupcake
3,Topamax,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 3, 2021",5,Was prescribed for appetite suppression due to ADHD and disordered binge eating.  Have been losing weight finally after trying hard at everything and ruining it by binging. The suppression is moderate to mild. I can eat like a normal person or just one meal a day. I push my plate away when I’m full and so not get any urges to over eat until I’m uncomfortable. 50 mg a day at night before bed.Only side effects are pins and needles in door and fingers a half hour to an hour after space and it last for about 5-10 minutes.,MA
4,Topamax,Obesity,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 30, 2021",9,This medication was actually prescribed to me by my psychiatrist because of my binge eating issue. I was very hesitant because at first taking this I didn’t notice a difference I’ve been taking it for almost the full four weeks now and it’s finally starting to work. My appetite is starting to be suppressed now and within the last week and a half I went from 220 lbs to 207 lbs! Crazy. I will admit I feel a little foggy but I’m also on abilify (which is another reason I got put on topamax the abilify makes my binging worse) and Wellbutrin so I'm normally a little foggy so it’s hard to tell if the topamax is causing it to be worse. Either way. It’s helping me with my binge eating and I’m actively losing weight.,Binge Eating

6,Topamax,Obesity,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 25, 2021",17,"I took a low dose for almost two weeks,  I lost my vision the headache the pain around my eyes went immediately to a optometrist and my pressure around both eyes were 56 I was vomiting and passed out they worked on me for 5-6 hours to bring the pressure down, I had acute glaucoma in both eyes that is rare.  Topamax says as a side effect could cause blindness and it’s true I still go to the doctor to monitor my eye sight to make sure the pressure is still coming down.  DO NOT TAKE THESE MEDS VERY DANGEROUS.",Phishsam
7,Topamax,Obesity,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 13, 2021",28,I just started topamax so far I get the tingling feeling and the brain fog nothing major though and I zone out a lot.

8,Topamax,Obesity,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 3, 2021",28,"At 5’7, I weighed 208 after giving birth at age 31. Developed what they thought was fibromyalgia. After 6 years was put on Topiramate - 200mg per day. Dropped 50 pounds in about 6 months. Went off it, eventually gained the weight back plus another 30.14 years since the first time: Back on it, have lost 40 pounds in 3 months. Still need to lose around 60-75 pounds... The fibromyalgia turned out to be MS. Haven’t been able to exercise in 20 years. I miss that, badly... But since I have no metabolism, it’s either starve or take the Topiramate. I’ve never noticed any negative side effects... But then, my resting state is pretty messed up; it would be hard to distinguish any new negative stuff from the plethora of negative stuff I already suffer regularly. ;)",Scottie
9,Topamax,Obesity,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 24, 2021",6,"My doctor prescribed this for obesity and I was on it 2-3 months. I didn't lose a single pound. It didn't even make me tired or sleepy, a side effect I would have welcomed. I discontinued it because it was giving me painful and disturbing pins and needles in my feet and legs at night. It wasn't worth waiting to see if I would lose weight further down the line. Plus I was fearful about the side effect I read about concerning vision.",Elly
10,Topamax,Obesity,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 2, 2020",27,"As far as appetite, Topamax helps. The longer you take it.however I feel like it really limits my mental ability when I take it and I can't even put words together sometimes. Brain foggish you could call it maybe. The extremity tingling is definitely real, and in the face sometimes.",g
11,Topamax,Obesity,,,"January 19, 2020",43,I was put on Lyrica and Gabapentin after I went through a bout with Ovarian cancer. I ended up with severe neuropathy in hands and feet. Anyway... also going back to 1994 I injured my back at work and at the time I weighed 98 lbs. I am only 5 ft. tall. So I see a pain dr. every month for pain. The first meds I mentioned famously add a lot of weight to your body which I did not know. I gained 40 lbs. which I have not been able to remove from my body until maybe now. My wonderful pain dr. has prescribed topiramate for me and we will see what happens. Maybe less pain and a nicer body.,Midge
12,Topamax,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 25, 2019",413,"I was prescribed Topamax for migraine headaches and weight loss. Being on Depakote, my weight had shot up 25 pounds with no end in sight. I was even craving sweets, which I had never done.After two days of Topamax, my appetite decreased noticeably. After a week, I had lost 7 pounds. By the time I had been on it for a month, I was down to 125 and still not hungry. Eating became something I thought I should do instead of something I HAD to do.When my weight dropped to 118, I stopped the Topamax, thinking, if I start to gain weight I’ll take it again. It’s been six years since I’ve taken Topamax and I weigh 130; 20.4 BMI.The results seem to last. I’m not sure it worked for my migraines, but it’s awesome for weight loss!",Sunny
13,Topamax,Obesity,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 15, 2019",108,"I’ve taken this medicine Topamax two separate times. The first time it helped me lose weight and I didn’t have many side effects but went off of it once I got in a serious relationship and heard it can make birth control less effective. However, two years after I got off of it I went back on it because of my binge eating disorder and it was horrible. This time I had side effects I was losing feeling in my hands and feet. My face would go numb. It didn’t really help with appetite. And it started to impact my memory. I almost immediately went off of it. And I’m still experiencing memory issues. I’ll be talking and can’t remember words in the middle of a sentence. Or I’ll tell someone something and then a couple of minutes repeat it because I forgot if I said it or not.

15,Topamax,Obesity,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 2, 2019",101,"Two weeks ago my Dr. Prescribed topamax to help aid my weight loss and help me reach my goals. All was well until last Friday every food and drink except for water and Gatorade made me nauseous and sometimes vomit. Constant constipation or raging diarrhea. None of the foods or drinks had much taste. No appetite but growling stomach . My feet were constantly tingling. I started getting dizzy and blacking out. Horrible breast pain and just felt horrible. It was the lowest dose prescribed so I stopped it last night and have an appointment tomorrow morning. The more I researched the drug it's horrible for your body eyes, digestive system, urinary system and reproductive system to name a few. Just not worth it!",Liz

It has caused me to become angry, severely depressed, having crying spells, overly sensitive for no reason, tingling in legs and hands, eye issues, and foggy head. It's been only 3 weeks and I am now tapering off cause I have been snapping on everyone. I was only on 50mg and even tapering to 35mg didn't lesson the side effects.",reviewer

I have always had the tendency to be heavy as I have fought my weight my entire life but now it's becoming threatening to my health. My doctor said the ""foggy"" head side effects and kidney stones etc are so rare that it's worth trying. He said that the tingling of hands and feet are the most common side effect and they tend to subside. Is this true?

18,Topamax,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 18, 2018",132,"3 months ago I was 259lbs and  now I am 219lbs now. I take topamax daily, and phentermine 1-2 days a week sometimes, and it’s helped not only my mood but my obsessive thoughts about eating and food. I don’t sit and think about it all day long. I also had an energy drink addiction and broke it because all carbonated drinks taste flat! All soda tastes awful!! I do get bad headaches if I miss a dose. Don’t miss your pills. I used to get bad headaches weekly but not since taking this medication- they don’t come around anymore. I’m topped off at 50/twice a day but I’d happily take 100/twice a day. I do get brain farts but after 3 months it’s not as bad.",Elle
19,Topamax,Obesity,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 25, 2018",57,"I gained a lot of weight from depression medications. They put me on Topamax to fix that. I’ve been on it for several weeks. Twice a day, 25 mg. Now the first day I immediately noticed an appetite change. I haven’t craved food all day, every day. Haven’t craved as much junk or sweets. And I have dropped a little weight. So it definitely works wonders. I am definitely struggling with the side effects so I think I am going to ween off it. As much as I’d love to continue to eat regular amounts and lose weight. The side effects are too much. Before I started this I had tingles in my hands and feet. But this intensified a LOT. I’m also having a lot of head pressure. Tiredness. And I feel functionally slow. I feel like I can’t think, can’t remember anything, can’t do simple tasks. Hopefully there is another medicine that can have the same effect for weight loss & appetite without these severe side effects.",ChronicallyChill
20,Topamax,Obesity,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2017",32,"It’s a little early for a review. It’s currently December 27th, 2017 and started Topamax on Dec. 7th. It’s been 20 days and I am a total binge eater. I’ve never been overweight, it’s not even in my genes to be overweight. I’m going through an extreme depression and being on over 12 different medications the past 5 years has been rough. I was 115-120lbs all the way up until I was 18. Started getting medicated when I was 18 and started gaining ever since. It’s normal to gain weight with age obviously, i’ve seen just about everyone I graduated with has gained weight. I blame Seroquel for my weight gain. HOWEVER. I weigh 161lbs starting topamax, it’s been 20 days, haven’t shifted in weight. Will post update later on.",heyitsmeee
21,Topamax,Obesity,9.0,,"December 4, 2017",41,First- there is absolutely no difference between brand and generic. There can't be legally. It is the same active ingredient and the same strength. It's just the name and cost and inactive ingredinets.  This being said... I don't understand where negative remarks come from. This medicine is amazing. I took it a while ago then asked to be changed to something else. I gained 20lbs and the other med didn't so anything. So I asked to be changed back. My leg muscles hurt and I have a few word issues but it's an amazing medicine.,Teetzytotz
22,Topamax,Obesity,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 2, 2017",77,"My original intent with Topamax was never weight loss, (mood) nor would have I ever believed the results I've obtained 19 months later. Quick negatives-my mental agility decreased significantly, I misspell my own name; most food & beverages taste like rubbish; and, the generic version is subpar. I was always overweight, I'm mid-30s, male, & slimmed from 275 to low 180s, size 42 to 32, XXL to L. It stays off! Still drop a few lbs. every month. However it's impossible for me to get off, I tried once and I went into a severe depression, but I'm a healthy weight now with perfect blood pressure.",crazydude81

So asked doc to change me to 100 mg twice a day. I just take the 200mg at once. That's when I finally noticed a change. I've lost 45 pounds in 6 months! I'm continuing to lose and my goal weight is 160 since I'm tall so only 25 more pounds to go.  I noticed at first pop tasted different but now it tastes fine. I used to love beer but now I don't want it..which is fine since it's so fattening lol. I only eat once or twice a day and the carb cravings are gone. I don't exercise much at all.

I wouldn't make any decisions about anything without talking it over with someone I trusted first. I am now up to 75 in the morning and at bedtime and I still have the tingling but the fog has been lifted the headaches are SO much less BUT I have only lost 3 pounds.

I have tried phentermine with no luck and usually had good success with natural weight loss until being diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and needing a knee replacement that keeps me from working out too much. So so far, I am impressed. I'll be back in a few weeks for a weigh in review. No side effects like others have had with mental fogginess or tingling. 25mg 2x day.

I had always bounced on diets. He started me on Topamax 25mg and I knew instantly it will work. It has a calming affect. I feel so full and I am going to bed without eating for the first time in years. I am very thankful. Not every medication is for everyone.  I am pleased with this one so far.",momma3kitties
44,Topamax,Obesity,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 19, 2015",196,"I am extremely obese. My starting weight when I started taking Topamax was 289.0 lbs. I weighed myself every few days. I started for one week taking 25 mg in the morning and 25 mg in the evening. Now I take 50mg in the morning and 50 in the evening.  Im also eating right veggies and fruits and snacks.  This medication is making me lose at least 13 lbs since Jan. 5, 15 and today I'm 276.0 and its Jan. 19, 2015.  in that short amount of time that's a good amount of weight to drop.  So thank you Topamax!",Steph6981
45,Topamax,Obesity,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 27, 2014",105,I was very excited when I started taking this medication. And then.... I had read the side effects and was like oh this is crazy. I will say I was on no other medication. I have never had hair loss like this. It was gobs of hair in my shower. The previous posters that refer to brain fog - yep that too.,NASHVEGAS
46,Topamax,Obesity,2.0,,"August 31, 2014",133,"Awful.  I lost 10 pounds in 5 weeks before I had to quit Topamax due to side effects, which were terrible.  They included:  memory loss and ""senior moments"" which increased 10-fold, I think this medicine dropped my IQ at least 15 points, that ""I'm not part of this world"" feeling of disconnectedness; and overheating to the point that I simply could not work out.Gained the 10 pounds back within 3 weeks of quitting.",Mike_West Coast

49,Topamax,Obesity,9.0,,"February 24, 2012",353,"Topamax is amazing. I originally took it 6 years ago to prevent migraines and lost 80 lbs as a bonus. At that time my doctor and I speculated that it would some day be approved for weight loss because I was not his only patient to report changes in the taste of carbonated beverages and chocolate while taking the medication. I also noticed that I did not dream about food while taking the medication, but within 3 months of changing medications food reentered my dream content. I am now back on the medication to address chronic pain issues and have already found the same results in weight loss, taste changes, and dream content.",Anonymous
50,Topamax,Obesity,9.0,,"September 15, 2011",177,"I have been battling my weight since I was pregnant with my first son, who just turned 2.  I was 165 when I got pregnant with him, and on the day I went in to have my second son (who is 5 months old today) I weighed 270. I just took my first 25 mg dose of Topamax last night.  I am addicted to Diet Dr. Pepper and can't even stand the taste.  Not hungry either, so I'm hopeful that this medicine will work.  I also take Celexa and Tenuate. I don't know if it's the combination, or just the Topamax, but I am feeling kind of ""floaty"" today, in a sense.  Maybe this will improve with time.",mommy_of_2

I was really surprised to see that it is sometimes used as a weight loss medicine. I didn't really notice any difference in my appetite.  However, my last visit to doctor did show that I've lost 5lbs.  I don't like the tingling, crawling skin sensation side effect.  That went away after a few days.",Anonymous
55,Topamax,Obesity,8.0,,"July 8, 2010",233,"I was on Topamax for almost 3 years, was prescribed it for severe migraines. The weight loss was a side effect, a nice one though! I didn't need to lose much to begin with, maybe 20lbs or so, and I started to notice that I went from the 140's to the 120's. I am now off this medicine as I have been migraine free for almost two years and the only bad thing I can say is that the weight comes right back on if you're not watching very carefully. Also - HUGE side effect was the medicine caused my body to not sweat, which caused severe overheating. It's a less common side effect, but a very super important one to be aware of.",Anonymous

57,Topamax,Obesity,8.0,,"July 20, 2009",209,"I've been on Topamax since March 2009. I've lost 75 of the 110 pounds I need to lose. The side effects are annoying and, in the beginning I really wanted to quit the medication. But as I've lost the weight, I've actually been able to decrease the dosage so a lot of the side effects have decreased as well. Some of them are easier to live with than others. The paresthesia has mostly subsided, but I do still struggle with memory lapses. I quit drinking all carbonated beverages because I do not like the way they taste. That has probably helped with the weight loss anyway. Overall, I am quite pleased. I am also pleased to read that others have been able to maintain their weight on this drug.",Smartchick73
58,Topamax,Obesity,7.0,,"April 7, 2009",191,"I have struggled with weight loss for years.  Food cravings are one of my ""symptoms.""  Topamax really did help with this, however my energy and memory are not what they use to be.  Originally I thought it was a trade off I could adjust to but the fuzzy memory for me is frustrating.  I sometimes say words that I am thinking about and don't even realize it.  Then argue that I didn't say it, only to find out I did. Silly, but worth revisitng my physician about.  I struggle with the same 10-20 lbs but won't give up. I would recommend trying it to people who are serious about weight loss.  It helps you push your plate away and not obsess about food.  That was an experience I had never had before, but I need my memory.",Anonymous

I had a successful gastric bypass in 1980 (but with serious lifelong medical complications) and lost 170lbs at after the operation.  Over the years I've gained and lost up to 70lbs but never held a steady weight. I saw a psychiatrist 6 years ago (for other reasons) and shared this with him.  He told me about Topamax and explained that it did not work in everyone, but had with some of his patients with true food disorders.  He started me at 5mg/day  and increased the dosage by 5mg/ week.  When I reached 150mg/day I noticed that I consistently pushed my plate away or stopped eating when I was full. It has been a miracle, and my weight hasn't varied more than 5lbs in 7 years.",beadyb
