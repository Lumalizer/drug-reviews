Feel an upset stomach, acid reflux and nausea. And very tired after the injection. Have lost about 3 lbs and gain it back by the next day. I eat low carb and usually I’m not hungry.

1,Semaglutide,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 1, 2022",0,Wegovy (semaglutide):I am on my ninth dose and I’m down thirty pounds. It curbs your appetite but also makes you nauseous. I’ve had constipation too. Stool softeners help. It works well and helps you lose weight.,CSB
2,Semaglutide,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 1, 2022",0,"Wegovy (semaglutide):So I am 5’4 and I found myself at the weight I was when I delivered my children, 145 pounds. For three years plus I desperately tried to approach my goal weight of 125 pounds dieting and feeling miserable for 3 years. I told my doctor I was dieting and exercising and could not budge the scale. At 60 years of age the weight just doesn’t come off like when you are young. I’ve been on Weygovy for 6 weeks and have lost 12 pounds-a miracle! Now at 133 pounds I’m staying the course to my goal. I will say the nausea is the worst side effect and comes in intermittent waves. I have zofran (odansetron) for when I can’t take the nausea. One of the best Side effects for me has been totally eradicating my diarrhea. I have irritable bowel on the diarrhea spectrum and luckily I did not get the diarrhea side effect but more the constipation, which has totally normalized my GI track!! I am so happy about this and assume this is due to slowing gastrointestinal motility.",Slimmer

The 2nd month on the .5ml dose schedule I lost 20 pounds 257lb to 237lb. The side effects are pure nightmare, but they fade a little after each injection. If you make it thru the second wave of side effects it gets better. I give it 7 cause side effects are awful but worth it.",Surf
4,Semaglutide,Obesity,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 1, 2022",0,"Wegovy (semaglutide):I’ve been on Wegovy for months now, I’m currently in the highest dosage. The first few months the pounds dropped so fast. I do get nauseous and have constipation regularly, a few weeks after starting a new dosage. I’m having extreme hair loss and shedding which is not listed as a side effect. Now on this new dosage my appetite is back and feel like I’m gaining some of the weight back. I find myself binge eating in bad foods and don’t feel full. So honestly I’m not sure if I’ll continue. If it continued to work as it did in the beginning I definitely would. I’ve lost a total of almost 45 pounds but definitely don’t want to gain it back. I wasn’t sure if the hair loss was related but I’ve read a few other reviews that had the same side effect so I’m leaning towards that. My husband has also on it and he doesn't like it at all, hasn’t lost any weight and he is on the 1 mg dose and I’m on 2.4 since I started before him.",Nicole

I now need surgery and also my inflammation C Reactive  protein count is normally at .5, it was 12 yesterday. It is supposed to stay under .5.

In the beginning it made me sick to my stomach, I had the belching and very little appetite. When I got to 0.50mg oh my God! I couldn't hardly eat anything for a couple of days. I was scared to go to the next level, but I did. When I was on the 1mg dose I didn't have any issues. Once I got to 1.7mg it wasn't bad either a little belching, headaches a couple of days, upset stomach and constipation kicked in. Getting ready to start the maintenance level 2.4mg and let's pray I tolerate it well. So far I have only lost about 27 lbs trying to lose about 17 more to get to my ideal weight.

I just got back from the doctor and I have lost 9.5 percent of my body weight, my blood pressure I way down, and my A1C level has gone from 7 to 5.8 in that time! One drawback is that I have had significant stomach issues with this drug that comes and goes.  Forget about eating anything spicy or heavy at night and It does curb your appetite, big time.

I lost 25 pounds and 4% of my body fat while on it, and yes it brings your appetite to basically non existent levels you must force yourself to eat (I found protein shakes the best way to get nutrients into me) the real benefit is to use the time that your eating less to understand portion control which will be the only reason this works long term!!!",Jeff

It has turned off the 24/7 hunger switch in my brain. I feel normal around food for the first time in my life. I started with Ozempic Jan 2021 and switched to Wegovy Oct 2021 (now at full 2.4 mg dose). To date, I’ve lost 87 lbs! I have 50 lbs more to lose. I’ve had virtually zero side effects, just minor upset tummy the 1st week. I feel full/satisfied with much less food, I no longer think of food constantly, I respond dramatically less to food cues (seeing or smelling food), and I no longer get overwhelmed at restaurants/holidays because of all of the delicious food options.

I don’t have that many side effects to discuss,  but  you do have to be careful what you eat and how much you eat. If you try to eat too much food that is high in fat or high in sugar you will not feel well.  You do have to listen to your stomach as you get full very quickly, if you push it you could become queasy.   As long as I pay attention to this, I feel fine and have little side effects.

While it was seen, it was a small percentage, but join any group on the drug, and you'll see hair loss everywhere. I'll add, I've lost hair from extreme weight loss before, this is nothing like this, this is major loss.

23,Semaglutide,Obesity,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 28, 2022",9,"Wegovy (semaglutide):I started with Ozempic (which is the same thing, I think) for assistance with diabetes. In the first year, I lost fifty pounds, I became more capable of moving better, and I started. In February and March of the second year, I was hospitalized twice for massive blood clots in my right thigh and the Wegovy was put aside for a couple of months. In April of 2021, my endocrinologist asked me if I would like to switch to this new version that might give me a boost. Sure, why not. I started with the lowest and immediately moved to the 2.4 doses. I have had no side effects no problems with the injection sites. The only issue has been obtaining the medicine. Oh, health changes. Within the first year of the Ozempic, my A1c went from 8.1 to 7.3, in the second year it has dropped to 6.1. My blood glucose averages are about 130, I can live with that! I have to be careful with going too low! Total weight loss is hovering between 95 and 100 lbs.",Bo Peep

Insatiable, depressed  with weight gain in last 4 years of 35lbs . Currently  at 5. 6 weighing 218. All in my stomach I felt like a bowling ball. I did not need a diet, the did food that I ate was fine any dietician would approve. But quantities and  frequency  WAS NOT FINE.This medication  changed my life I only eat when I am hungry  at 12 noon and 5pm. Yes, no in-between  meal or snacks. And I can eat slowly not gulping  down my meal.  As you can imagine  the weight loss in 3 weeks is  8lbs. I have the energy to workout  4 to 5 days a week  up to a 1.5  hour workout on days off. My question is as I approach  4 weeks I am waking up hungry  in the last few days.  Is this why we take an ascending  dose for the first 4 months??

I did not lose weight on the 1.7 mg dose but it was over the holiday period.  I have seen a large decrease in appetite on the 2.4 mg dose and am pleased with the weight loss because it's occurred during a stressful period when I haven't exercised as much as I would like.

I eat similarly to how I did before, but my portions are much smaller. I have experienced some side effects, but everyone’s experience is different. I can usually combat the upset stomach and gas with gas-x and pepto. I have experienced constipation, but that’s honestly something I’ve battled all of my adult life.

I have noticed an increase in nausea at times (but I did already struggled with intermittent nausea prior to starting Wegovy) and some slight dizziness at times. It has curbed my appetite and truthfully I am craving healthier foods overall. However, I didn't really eat badly before (no soda/sugary drinks, gluten free, low meat intake, lots of good plant based proteins and veggies), but I do have a sweet tooth and would find myself eating chocolate when stressed. I still do, but to a much lower extent. I needed to lose the weight to help relieve the pressure on my back. I've struggled to keep weight off and maintain my fitness over the last 7 years since severely injuring my back.

The cure for the nausea that worked best for me was a couple bouillon cubes.  Did the trick every time.  Ate high protein and low carbs.  Increased salads which are a key component of doing well with Wegovy and a low carb/high protein diet.  I had gastric bypass in 2011 and lost quite a bit of weight which I kept off for a while, but gained almost all of it back through Covid and began Wegovy in October, 2021.  As of today I have lost 67 lbs which is absolutely amazing.  I am rehabbing for a knee replacement and this has been the absolute missing piece.

I went down to the 1 MG and we will see if I can do that.I also take pain meds and a fibro drug ( also causes nausea) I have a nausea med called Zofran. You might want to ask for this.

How anyone makes it to the 2.4 mg is beyond me.  I made it to the second dose of 0.5 mg before I threw in the towel.This stuff is WICKED. I spent 6 weeks of my life with an upset stomach, the absolute worst reflux and heartburn I have ever had, and constant nausea.  I had to literally force myself to eat.  Would not recommend.
