The first week I had to take 1/2 tablet because I couldn't sleep but that has gone away. I feel really good taking phentermine. I take it either before breakfast, after breakfast or mid morning. I have always exercised, cardio and weight lifting, so continuing that, lifting heavy to try to avoid losing muscle.  I'm definitely eating less, less appetite. I am not counting calories or keeping a food diary. I have a DEXA body composition scan scheduled in 7 weeks to check my % body fat and determine my stopping weight.  Insurance does not cover this medication.",MDDE

4,Phentermine,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 7, 2021",8,"I am a 50 year old and was failing miserably at keeping my weight/body fat % at a healthy level due to insulin resistance and being perimenopausal. After trying unsuccessfully on my own for almost a year, I talked to my doctor and started taking Phentermine 30 mg/day on Sept. 05, 2021. & have lost 15 lbs. in 4 weeks.  I did not have any side-effects except for the dry mouth which is easily addressed by drinking water. Its very important to note that I did not just take the medicine and the fat/weight melted away, I overhauled my nutrition and added exercise to my daily regiment. Phentermine absolutely worked to suppress my appetite and give me the energy to make it thru my day on an average of 1000 calories, but I also have also been making healthy food choices and walk 10k steps at least 5-6 times/week. I have now been bumped up to 37.5mg/day and will post an update in another 30 days. I am taking this time to form good eating/exercise habits. Start weight - 184 lbs. Current 169 lbs.",PHNTRMN

7,Phentermine,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 4, 2021",3,"Lomaira (phentermine):I have been taking Lomaira for about a month. I had gastric sleeve done a year ago and needed a boost in my weight loss so my doctor prescribed Lomaira combined with Topiramate. I have lost 10 pounds in a month! Some side effect I have noticed is dry mouth and some dizziness at times if I’m not eating correctly. I also can’t sleep in as much as I would like to, I can only get about 7 to 8 hours which is still good. I do take my blood pressure every day an hour or two after I take the medication to be safe. Be prepared for potential pushback from your pharmacist, I had a pharmacist who wouldn’t fill the prescription because he felt it was unsafe. This of course with his own personal opinion, many other pharmacists are fine as this drug has been around for 60 years. Good luck!",Mareedratt

10,Phentermine,Obesity,1.0,,"February 1, 2021",3,"I started taking this phentermine medication in Aug of 2020. I lost 30lbs in 2 months, it was going well. I did suffer from anxiety before I took the pills however it got worse. I did an intense workout and my heart rate did not go down after an hour of resting. I was driving and my heart rate went up to about 140 at resting. I was gasping for air. I rushed my self to the hospital,  told the dr what was going on. EKG came back normal however my blood work was not normal my cardiac enzymes came back elevated. So they admitted me. They told me to stop taking the medication. I was scheduled to do an echocardiogram, but it was cancelled it and said I was having a panic attack and because of the intense work out it caused my heart to work more and it released those enzymes. Every since I have been having extremely bad panic attacks at night and I keep thinking that I am going to die. I feel like I am losing my mind.  I will say if you are obese please look into bypass surgery.",TanLove

17,Phentermine,Obesity,3.0,,"February 1, 2020",26,"48-year-old woman and I have lost 20 pounds, by a 1,200 calorie diet & exercising at least 4 times a week (sometimes 5 or 6). After plateauing at 180 for over 2 months, my doctor put me on phentermine 10 days ago.I thought it was a miracle at first! I felt very peppy but not jumpy, I had NO appetite, and 6 or 7 pounds fell off  in about 4 days. Then I just.. stopped. Have been at 175 for 4 days, despite maintaining my diet & exercise routine. I have asked her how to stop because of the insane side effects. The dry mouth was maddening & not relieved by guzzling water all day. I started having breathing problems. And yesterday, I had some kind of psychological break. I spent the day crying and trying to stop crying, and I was in such a dark place in my mind, something I've done before but not in years. I guess it works for some people, but for me, it was amazing, then it stopped, then it nearly caused me to drive into a brick wall. All in the space of a couple weeks. NOT WORTH THE RISK, I say.",Kat
18,Phentermine,Obesity,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 25, 2020",21,"Last year I took phentermine for 5 months. I lost 30lbs in the first 2 months. In total I lost 50lbs. Beginning weight of 210 obese BMI. Side effects I experienced-When I first began I took a half dose of 30mg for a week because jumping right into a full capsule was too much because it made my heart race and made me feel jittery. Throughout the whole time I took it my mouth was ALWAYS dry so I drank lots of water or chewed gum mainly because dry mouth can speed up tooth decay. My jaw would feel like it had TMJ even if I hadn’t chewed for some hours. I would wake up with sore teeth as though I was grinding my teeth. I was constipated more than usual. I took the pill in the morning so I could sleep at night, it will keep you awake if you take it too far into the day. The side effects were annoying, but the weight loss was great. This medication made it so I never really felt hungry and if I did it would hurt my stomach to eat more than a fist full of food.",Ello

25,Phentermine,Obesity,,,"December 7, 2019",17,I started Phentermine on Oct 16 at 281.lb Today I went to the Dr 12-6 and I am 260lb. The Dr was extremely happy. I should loss more but I was taking half dose the first month then Thanksgiving I took whole pill. Some days I skipped because I forgot. I also did Keto and intermittent fasting. I would take the pill at 11:30-12. Then eat Nothing after 7pm. Nothing but water. I did not exercise but a couple times due to scared my heart would race. I had no side effects except dry mouth. If I had trouble sleeping I would put on rain music from Youtube and I would be knocked out for the count. I do feel my period was VERY heavy so I did not take it a couple days on my period. I did realize I AM an emotional eater and I was consuming way to many calories. Now if I want cookies I eat one or two. If you recognize and more alert on intake you will lose weight and keep it off.  This month I will start walking on treadmill etc. I do a lot walking anyway. I'll come back later and follow up.,LadyKR

27,Phentermine,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 27, 2019",31,"This drug phentermine is amazing to help loose weight!  I was skeptical before trying it.  I didn’t think an appetite suoppressant would help; even when I’m not hungry, I eat.  I’m glad I tried it.  It doesn’t just curb hunger pangs; it made me not focus on food.  I used to obsess about food, and I’d keep thinking about it til I gave in.  On phentermine, I go hours without feeling hungry OR thinking about food!  Maybe an occasional craving but quickly forgotten.  I went for my follow up and in just over 5 weeks, I have lost 22 pounds!  And it was pretty painless.  I did eat less; primarily veggies and lean protein with some fruit.  And I exercise 5 days/week.  So it wasn’t all phentermine.  But it really helps.  I take it in the morning so it doesn’t affect my sleep, but I noticed that I don’t take midday naps now.  Definitely experienced dry mouth, and occasionally I feel anxious, but otherwise no side effects.  My blood pressure has not been affected.  This stuff is AMAZING.",Poopycat

I am also very sensitive to caffeine,  so last night (my first night) I drank a hot cup of chamomile tea to relax me for bed.

Normally I get so darn hungry, and shaky and confused if I wait too long to eat, thus I normally shove whatever is easiest in my mouth to combat those feelings quickly.  I did not have those feelings, and felt like I could concentrate more on making a healthy meal vs. being so shaky and light headed, forcing me to overeat. Obviously overeating and making poor choices in what caused me to be overweight. I am starting at 207lb.  I have gained 50 lbs in the last 5 years and am 49 years old.

It’s pointless to take this medicine if your not actively taking steps to eat right and exercise- something that this medicine helped me kick start.

43,Phentermine,Obesity,10.0,,"August 24, 2019",20,I've lost 30lbs in about 2 months. I am truly so grateful me doctor prescribed this! I've made major lifestyle changes that have help me and my family. I always struggled to lose weight. It was like lose 4 lb in a month with EXTREMELY hard work and have a bad weekend and gain 2 back. Years of this- I was losing hope. I was 190 with a BMI of 34 and she suggested phentermine. She started me on the 15mg for 1 month then go to 30mg. I'm glad I started on the 15mg because I think the 30 or 37.5 would have given me too bad of side effects. Drink water and don't forget to eat because not eating will make you feel terrible and it's not necessarily the med. I lost 15lb the 1st month. I didn't drink soda or sweets and ate smaller portions. My portion control was out of whack before. The med made it easy for me to do this. I lost another 10lbs the second month (on 30mg) and was officially not obese BMI anymore! On my 3rd mth and the med isn't as effective any more but its still suppressing my appetite.,Anonymous

I took a week off (left it at home whilst on vacation) and gained back 5 lbs over the week because I was not following my diet AT ALL.

89,Phentermine,Obesity,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 14, 2018",7,"I have been taking phentermine for one week now, it has drastically suppressed my appetite and gave me a nice boost of energy. I take the 37.5 mg and I take half when I wake up and half at lunch time. I eat low carb  food and I take in about 1350 calories a day. Because I am not usually hungry I have to schedule my meal times and stick to them. The only side effect I have suffered from is dry mouth and that's only if I'm not drinking enough water. In one week so far I have lost 8.5 pounds. This is just with healthier eating. I work a sedentary job and don't exercise. This medicine, so far, has been a godsend. No more mindless snacking or feeling hungry all the time.",xosecretaryxo

I weigh in w/ the nurse once a week & get my shot. Every fourth week I meet w/ the doctor. I've lost  13 lbs. as of 9/7/18 (2 mo). For 3 weeks I was plateaued at 270 lbs. It has really curbed my appetite & reduced my cravings so my calorie intake is less. I am also eating healthier with fruits & fiber. My 6 mo goal is 50 lb loss, as I am increasing my exercise with an elliptical machine. I'll do the meds for one more month, as it is recommended for max 12 weeks. I have a bit of dry mouth & drink at least a gallon of water a day. My blood pressure was slightly elevated before the meds, but the doctor has not been concerned.

If you can't exercise all that much I suggest taking a walk in the morning and night for around 10-20 mins at least.

Now I got on the scale today and my total was 160lbs.  The only side effects that I have is dry mouth. Yes  this includes your lips. You will be using lots of balm.  Also try to have a good diet.  Also even though your appetite is pretty much decreased try to eat small meals and drink plenty of water. Remember your doctor will take you off Phentermine in 30 days and you will gain the weight back.  To prevent that eat small portions.  Also pickles are excellent. You will maintain your weight and when the doc prescribe you back on Phentermine you will continue to lose weight.,looking good.

Besides taking the medication, I am also eating healthier and doing a little bit of exercise.  In the morning when I wake up I take 1 pill,  1 hour later I have breakfast, for lunch at 11:30 I have a light lunch, and I eat dinner by 5 pm. I will have healthy snacks in between meals.   I want to lose 30 more pounds.  This medication has made me more alert, especially at work.  Gives me more energy.  The only thing negative has been the dry mouth, but its not too bad because then you are forced to drink more water, which is good!",mely84

That's 17 lbs. The first day I took this medication I could not believe my lack of interest in food. However, the first 2 days on this medication I had a horrible headache, bad taste in my mouth, and extreme dry mouth. Symptoms DID go away after 2 days, so that was the good part.  I exercise about 2 days a week, at this time. I would suggest to team up with your Dr with this so he can keep an eye on your blood pressure, wt loss, heart rate, etc. This medication has started to wear off recently but my eating habits are on the right track. Other than that, this medication is amazing!",sdeaver1

When I started my lbs was 184 with 34%. Today my lbs was 180 with 30% and yesterday I didn't take it so my suggestion is like others, take it and take mini breaks from it. Took it today and plan on doing 30min of yoga and 20mins of Pilates and 30min of walking. My hope is that my body fat % will go down to 25% and my weight will go down to 135. Now I know that this won't happen overnight, and it will take hard work and I'm in for it. If you know anything else that worked for you, please let me know.",nicole g

I also have noticed that, unless I have been off of it for at least four weeks after being on it for five weeks I don't lose weight and my appetite is not under control. My doctor does this so that I don't become dependent and require more to lose weight. I am trying to get more exercise, but I am not good at getting out there as much as I should. Also, I need to control my carbs better. That, along with the exercise is key for me. Good luck to all of you trying to lose weight. ",Anonymous

Just read all the blogs & I'm going to stop the medicine for 3-4 days then start again.  At my last Dr. visit he upped my dosage to 2 tabs/day.  According to the blogs, I'm taking the tab at the right times of the day and in the right way.  I have an extremely active job and am on my feet 5-1/2 hr non-stop 5 days/week; however, am getting ready to start traveling with my husband in our RV so plan to start exercising by joining Curves/walking.

I had started and quit a few diets before taking this medicine because I never felt satisfied after a small meal and I always wanted to snack.  The first day I took it, I was shocked at my lack of interest in food.  I would eat, but not with the same vigor and certainly not the same quantities.  I noticed my mood was improved and that I had the energy to do things, including obsessive cleaning of my house.  After several weeks of taking it, the medicine didn't seem as strong to me; however, my new eating and exercise patterns were established.  Good diet starter but not a permanent solution.",Anonymous

I'd have kept using it but didn't have the money to keep going to the doctor. Some years have passed and I'm back at another doctor who's giving me Tenuate. It's nothing like I remember with the phentermine. I was probably in better shape my first time around because Tenuate just doesn't seem the same. I don't have nearly as much energy as I did with phentermine. When I was taking phentermine I was constantly looking for something to do.

However it is not all due to Adipex as I was only prescribed 2 months supply and it has been 8 months since I started my journey! The main goal for the drug is to help you kick start your weight loss. It is not meant to be taken for extended periods of time as it can be habit forming.  When I was on Adipex, I didn't take it every day. It was more like every other day, and just half a pill!

I lost 80 pounds in 6 months exercising 3x per week. Always had tons of energy. I started taking Adipex(phentermine) at the suggestion of a friend who said it would give me similar results. She was right! It gives me energy and curbs my appetite tremendously. My biggest problem of running to vending machine at 3pm everyday is non-existent now. I started at 262lbs and I'm down to 226lbs (with no exercise yet).  I have a long road ahead but I'm well on my way.
