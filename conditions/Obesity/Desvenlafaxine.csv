0,Desvenlafaxine,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 11, 2021",7,"I have been on it cause my other meds made me gain weight. I have lost 25kg in 15 weeks. I have chronic pain syndrome. I eat 1 meal per day and do not feel hungry. It is a massive plus, to have a weight loss side affect for an anxiety depression medication 10/10.",Lane
1,Desvenlafaxine,Obesity,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 18, 2021",20,"Was prescribed 50mg for depression, I am currently on week 5 and have lost 20 lbs without intentionally restricting whatsoever. My appetite is gone and my energy is increased. Very few minor depressive episodes also. I have been on over 15 antidepressants and none have ever worked this well.",Anonymous
2,Desvenlafaxine,Obesity,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 20, 2020",8,"I have been on desvenlafaxine for almost a month and I've lost my appetite almost completely. The first week I had awful nausea, dizziness, constipation, and hardly wanting to eat. Now I just kind of get nauseated sometimes but I really don't have an appetite. I've lost a couple of pounds already. I have to make sure that I eat enough during the day. I don't know how long this will last but I'm hoping to last for a while because I have a binge eating problem. But I definitely feel an appetite suppressant with this medicine.  So far it's been helping very well with my depression! I'm still having anxiety issues and trouble concentrating but it's definitely helping with my depression and appetite. I have insurance so it only cost me $10",Coco

5,Desvenlafaxine,Obesity,9.0,,"August 10, 2010",24,Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):I have been on this medication for about 2 months now. Started this medication for depression and had the pleasant side effect of appetite suppression for me. I didn't notice anything during the first month of use but during this second month I have noticed not being as hungry as well as eating smaller portions. I have also lost 10lbs in the last month and have more energy. I have had no major side effects but do have an occasional headache but Tylenol generally helps that!,Anonymous
6,Desvenlafaxine,Obesity,,,"November 15, 2009",15,Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):I am on 150 mg of Pristiq and I have gained 10 pounds. This is not an appetite suppressant.,Anonymous
7,Desvenlafaxine,Obesity,8.0,,"July 24, 2009",18,Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):I have been taking this now for 30 days and on the 13 day I felt dizzy and sick to my stomach. I also did not feel emotionally well for a few days after. I lost weight the first week and appetite has been suppressed somewhat. I continue to lose a few pounds a week. Doctor thinks the side effects I have had will diminish so I will be taking this for another month.,mybrni
8,Desvenlafaxine,Obesity,8.0,,"February 26, 2009",24,"Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):This medication was prescribed to me for appetite suppression. I have been on it for 6 days now and have had no real side effects. I feel I may have had some depression issues I was not completely aware of, as I feel a bit more positive and in better spirits.  I think it's too soon to tell overall how well this medication works.  As of now, I have not experienced appetite suppression.",PSJ71
