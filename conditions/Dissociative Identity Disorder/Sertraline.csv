1,Sertraline,Dissociative Identity Disorder,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 24, 2021",8,"This drug made me hallucinate and I was almost instantly suicidal. SSRI's lower dopamine and I believe people with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) need to up their dopamine to help with dissociation and CPTSD. This is an awful drug for DID, depression, anxiety, stress, or anything else. Use supplements. Find your highs/lows of major neurotransmitters and find supplements that work.",Angela
2,Sertraline,Dissociative Identity Disorder,10,,"August 25, 2020",22,hi my name is holly and I’ve been dealing with depression/ depersonalization for about 4-5 years now. I had been to a doctor before about it and was prescribed wellbutrin in which is helped but I had eventually stopped. It wasn’t until about 2 years later that I started seeing a different doctor and was prescribed zoloft. To start off- I never had any bad side effects such as suicidal thoughts/ depression which is a great thing to start. As weeks/ months went by I eventually started to feel a lot better and more like myself. It helps me not over think so much and in a sense helps me from obsessing over bad thought and the OCD that I deal with. All the symptoms I dealt with before as well slowly went away almost completely although I still feel off sometimes. This medication is great and Adderall as well helps me control my thoughts and feel a lot better. I recommend this medication a lot!,holly
3,Sertraline,Dissociative Identity Disorder,1,,"July 22, 2020",20,"I found this drug disagreed with me heavily. I took it for 2 months & had some of the worst dissociation and loss of control I'd ever experienced. I was getting near constant intrusive thoughts from parts and nothing felt real to me. Before taking sertraline I had a lot of extreme anxiety alternating with apathy, but after I felt floaty and scared in a much different way to usual generalised anxiety. It was an overwhelming and vague sense of dread/loss of control, rather than anxiously fixating on things and cycling through everything that could go wrong, like usual. I also wasn't told that you have to wean yourself off this medication so when I couldn't afford the 3rd month's prescription I went cold turkey and that has some horrible side affects of it's own.There are a couple of positive reviews so obviously it does work for some with DID, but I wanted to give the opposite perspective (so people can weigh up pros/cons) because medications affect us all differently.",Sh
4,Sertraline,Dissociative Identity Disorder,9,,"February 24, 2019",32,"I urge everyone to give meds TIME to work. I suffered with anxiety off and on for years, but last year I watched my mother die right in front of me, after which I had a miscarriage, found out I had a Chiari1  (a condition in which brain tissue goes into your spinal canal) and was BRCA positive so needed to have ovaries removed shortly after. By August I was experiencing derealization for weeks at a time, terrible panic attacks daily and severe health anxiety with obsessive thoughts. I was dizzy and started dreading leaving the house.I feel much better now!!! My only side effects were some spaciness and fatigue for the first two weeks. I have almost no derealization and my anxiety/panic/intrusive thoughts are down probably 80%. I would urge anyone who is desperate with their mental health to try sertraline. I started off at 25mg the first two weeks ,went up to 50mg, at the 6 week mark I took 75mg for a week and am now on 100mg. The only downside is my sex drive is a bit diminished, definitely worth it though.",EvieS
5,Sertraline,Dissociative Identity Disorder,10,,"March 24, 2015",76,"I had what was called depersonalization and derealization from my severe anxiety. I tried every natural thing i could think of. Exercise, eat right, distraction etc... but i lost hope because i couldn't push past this feeling. So i tried zoloft as my last hope and started with 25mg and i had some side effects but not bad. I will say it was worth it. My dr upped it to 50mg which gave me the most benefit. It was a lifesaver! Im so glad i tried it. I took it for 6 months and weaned from it 6 months and it was perfect. However 3 years later i have bad anxiety again due to stressors in my life so im willing to try it again but as far as dissasociating still very minimal. Hope this helps.",kendrah198907
