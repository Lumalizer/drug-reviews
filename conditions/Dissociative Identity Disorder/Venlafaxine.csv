1,Venlafaxine,Dissociative Identity Disorder,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 3, 2019",8,"I started on citalopram for my anxiety, depression and OCD. It simply did not work for me, I switched to regular venlafaxine at 75mg. It worked really well for almost a year, until recently I started getting withdrawal towards the end of the day (was taking it with breakfast) the doctor changed me to extended release capsules, it has only been a few days and I am terribly tired and overall just don’t feel great, I am waiting another week or so until I decide if I am going to stay on extended or go back to regular with a different dosage",Smot
2,Venlafaxine,Dissociative Identity Disorder,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 8, 2014",32,I was put on a lot of meds for 9 years - I even overdosed on one wanting to die after 3 months. In the lock down ward they found out I had Dissociative Identity Disorder and put me on Effexor XR 150mg. I have been taking for 10 years now. In the beginning I felt like a zombie but then when it got into my system I was not raging on people and I have not lost time. I was going to sleep and waking up days or months later not know where I'd been or who I was with I had to give up my children so I would not hurt them. It doesn't matter if you are for or against this if you have a problem you should get help and let someone close to you know so they can watch if something changes.,safezone
