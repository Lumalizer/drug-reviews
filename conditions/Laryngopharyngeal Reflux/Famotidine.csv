1,Famotidine,Laryngopharyngeal Reflux,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 13, 2021",0,"Otc famotidine works great for me. No bad effects that I can tell and unlike PPIs, appears to be safe for long-term use. Without it I am always aware of anything I swallow including water.",mu7
2,Famotidine,Laryngopharyngeal Reflux,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 30, 2021",4,"Started taking for LPR about a week ago. I am 35, but suffered with anxiety in my early 20s. Haven't had a panic attack in about 10 years. On the second day of taking famotidine prescribed by my doctor, my entire body ached - muscle pain that one would usually get from fevers. I felt run down, but couldn't sleep. Had the worst insomnia of my life. Followed by a really bad panic attack. Stopped the medication immediately, everything went back to normal. Tried famotidine again a week later and the same thing occurred.Do not take if you are prone to anxiety.",PanicBabe

4,Famotidine,Laryngopharyngeal Reflux,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2021",52,"ENT doctor prescribe Famotidine on 2/12/21. I feel horrible can not eat, feel like I’m having a heart attack had a panic attack. Chest tightness ,headache  anxiety I feel worse. This medication needs to be off the market! Going the Alternative medicine route , new breed of doctors are Pharmaceutical drug  pushers. Doctors only treat symptoms, but never the cause. A Doctor is more interested in keeping you sick than curing you. This way, you keep coming back for more treatments.",Natural remedy
5,Famotidine,Laryngopharyngeal Reflux,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2021",19,"If the manufacturer of your generic drug is Aurobindo Pharm beware!  I know of more than one case of developing urgent diarrhea which turned into diarrhea with bright red blood.  Now I have to get a colonoscopy to assess the damage this drug has caused after only taking 3.5 weeks.  The adverse bowel movement symptoms developed after week 2, but the drug never helped my acid reflux symptoms.  In other cases, patient had different drug manufacturer and the drug worked with no complications.  I would like drugs.com to add name of manufacturer to the criteria for reviews as it definitely makes a difference!",Cheryl
6,Famotidine,Laryngopharyngeal Reflux,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 4, 2020",50,"This drug famotidine is horrible! I’ve tried most PPIs and H2 blockers with minimal success. The only thing that worked for my chronic throat clearing was Zantac. I was devastated when they pulled it. I thought famotidine would be a good replacement. I couldn’t have been more wrong. After 4 months of taking this drug, I developed horrible stomach pain with diarrhea. I was ready to call my GI doctor because I thought something was terribly wrong. Along with that, I was extremely agitate and anxious and could not sleep. I had to get a benzo from my primary to help with the agitation and anxiety, I started reading sites like this and stopped this horrible drug. I feel so much better and no longer feel like I’m going crazy,",Midwest Mom
7,Famotidine,Laryngopharyngeal Reflux,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 2, 2020",34,"I've been struggling with acid reflux but NO heartburn due to the quarantine - overeating and lack of exercise. I had never had acid reflux in my life. I was recommended to take famotidine 20 mg twice a day for 30 days. It did relieve constant symptoms and about four days in I felt almost normal. I kept taking the drug just in case (didn't want to quit at day 5). However, I think it is causing more harm than good. I am bloated, hungry but unable to eat, weird nausea, cough, and slight reflux. I'm going to stop taking this and see if my bodies balance will return to normal. So while it was effective, I think it also has made me sick.",BRabbit
