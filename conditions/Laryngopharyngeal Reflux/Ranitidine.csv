1,Ranitidine,Laryngopharyngeal Reflux,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 27, 2019",1,"I am extremely sensitive to all medications.  If there is a side effect I will get it and usually refrain from taking anything other than the furosemide and potassium chloride I have been on for many years to control my idiopathic pitting edema.  However I suffered vocal cord injury (dysphonia), dysphagia as well as laryngospasm after using Symbicort 160 for only 5 days.  I was referred to an ENT who thought I had LPR (I do not) and prescribed ranitidine 300 once a day and omeprazole.   I will not take the omeprazole but this AM took one 300 mg capsule of ranitidine as prescribed.   5 hours later I have marked pitting edema in both legs.   My legs were not at all swollen this morning but are severely swollen now (at least 1/2 inch pitting in each leg).  There can be no other explanation than the capsule of ranitidine I took this morning.  Needless to say I will NOT be taking this drug again.",Emmief
