0,Imiquimod,Molluscum Contagiosum,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 11, 2019",1,"I took the medicine imiquimod 3 times per week for 30 days for Molluscum Contagiosum bumps just above the crack on my buttocks. I had to quit for one week because my rectal area was sore, red, burning and itching. A couple small open sores developed. I used hydrocortisone cream and this helped a lot. Most of the bumps are gone except one that is stubborn. I restarted applying the cream after a one week hiatus. My rectal area became very sore again. The one stubborn bump became larger and then greatly reduced in size. I quit the Imiquimod for a few days until the sores are better.",cguywa
1,Imiquimod,Molluscum Contagiosum,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2018",18,"Aldara (imiquimod):Had HORRIFIC effects from taking this. I'm currently in the process of getting a diagnosis for Small Fiber Neuropathy because of this drug. I was in the best health of my life before I started applying it. Within two days, I had burning sensations all over my body. It caused a systemic reaction. I discontinued immediately, but over two years later, I still get painful burning all over my body. Google Aldara and ""small fiber neuropathy"" and you will see I am not the only one who had this condition triggered by Aldara/imiquimod. This drug is a powerful immuno-modulator that triggers multiple types of immune-mediated cells in the body and causes the body to attack itself. People are getting sick from it and their claims are not being addressed.",Anonymous
2,Imiquimod,Molluscum Contagiosum,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 10, 2017",4,I had sex with somebody' I had known for years and two weeks later I had grown 4 bumps. They weren't inside my vagina they where in the outside of it. Mostly on the top. I got nervous and went to the clinic. The doctor kept telling me is nothing it will go away. So I left it alone. 2 months later it was still there so when back at least two more times to the clinic and they said the same thing. Fortunately 2 of them went away but I hate looking at the rest and it spreaded a little. I have had it for at least 6 months. So decided to go to a different clinic. They prescribed imiquimod. I've been using it for about a month now and it kinda has been working. Is clearing very slowly. But it gets very red and itchy sometimes so I put Aloe,ShyG
