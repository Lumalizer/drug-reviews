0,Macrobid,Bladder Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 24, 2022",0,"Just here to talk about my experience so far. I was diagnosed with a bladder infection been in pain for about two weeks. Never had one before, I’m in my late 20’s. The first day I took it with some pasta since you have to take it with food. I felt okay, aside from a mild headache. Next day I took it with a cup of peaches since I had to be to work early didn’t have time to eat a full meal. BIG MISTAKE, you have to take this with a full meal or you’re likely to get nauseous. Not speaking for everyone, but this is what happened to me. Didn’t throw up was just nauseous until I ate something. I felt better after that. I am on day 3 and I already feel the difference, the pain has decreased a lot and I’m going less frequently. If you aren’t a big water drinker, you need to become one. I drink water every day since my job requires me to be on my feet all day, but water does help quicken the recovery process. I still have 6 days but I feel better already!",Anonymous

Just so randomly too! Never once had an issue before neither.My whole body was the colour of a postbox, I had this rash all over my body, I was shivering but at the same time I was sweating I was being sick and had a really Sharp burning pain inside my body. It was horrible. :( I never though that I would become allergic to a tablet I’ve taken so many times before",Hunter.04

Nausea, watery diarrhea, stomach upset even days after stopping it still. Wondering if a couple of my meals weren't big enough. As well would add a probiotic while taking it if I need to take it again. UTI cleared thankfully so glad as I had pain and burning. Just hoping these symptoms stop soon! Taking a probiotic now for a couple days but still having symptoms.",Mmmm
4,Macrobid,Bladder Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 12, 2021",0,"I didnt have really any symptoms of bladder infection when I went to the doctor. I have IBD so when I had a flare up of diarrhea and stomach cramping, I didn't think it was anything really until my back also started hurting. Doctor confirmed I had a bladder infection & prescribed this drug. Right off the bat, I just want to say if your not allergic to cipro or another antibiotic, I'd try that instead. Also if you are migraine prone I wouldn't try this medication. I’ve never taken an antibiotic that gave me the numerous side effects this one gave me. For now, it’s bearable, but I don’t know exactly why or how it’s causing me to feel like I have the flu. The most noticeable symptom is pain behind my eyes and horrible headache. Also really bad fatigue. I don't have a fever. Bladder infection symptoms are actually mostly resolved, but I feel horribly lousy. I will probably miss work tomorrow… luckily it was holiday today. I will ask for a different antibiotic next time.",katarina
5,Macrobid,Bladder Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 5, 2021",0,"I’ve had a bad experience with antibiotics before and held off on taking this for almost two days after it was prescribed for my mild UTI symptoms, due to fear of side effects and hoping it would go away on its own. Well it didn’t and got worse, so I had to take it. Woke up at 2am with lower abdominal pain and awful burning urination, popped one of these pills, and woke up the next day with no more pain, burning, or urgency. It really helped in less than 6 hours. Of course you have to keep taking it as prescribed to make sure the infection is gone, but it got rid of the symptoms that fast. I’m on my last day of taking these and have had practically no side effects. I always took it with a full stomach and had no nausea.I’m not trying to dismiss the negative reviews. It’s important that people know what can happen and monitor themselves. But this is a VERY commonly prescribed med, and unhappy people are far more likely to leave a review, which is why I left this.",Hannah

I had a UTI and took my 5 days ( twice a day every 12 hours) like l was supposed to  and felt fine while I was taking it.  48 hours  after from  my last pill  I was in the ER with bleeding, stomach cramps, chills, fever, diarrhea . I was diagnose with colitis !  Never  ever experienced this in my 53 years of life with antibiotics. I'm on a new antibiotic now to clear up the infection in my colon and have to make appointment with a stomach doctor.  It was one scary experience over taking antibiotic that  you thought was safe!

8,Macrobid,Bladder Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 13, 2021",0,Macrobid 100mgs twice a day cured my recurring uti's. I felt better by the second day of treatment. The sooner treatment was begun the faster it worked. However I did experience headaches. The problem is reinfection from bacteria in my partner's saliva. No further infection symptoms until exposed again. Wish my Dr. would give me a prescription to take at the first sign of trouble.I don't want to take a lot of antibiotics but these uti's have caused me a lot of suffering.,Lil. d

I’m resistant to a few antibiotics, and have horrible side effects to cipro. There are actually studies about how horrible cipro is. Macrobid is the ONLY antibiotic that clears me up with no side affects and doesn’t mess up your gut bacteria which leads to feeling down and depressed. I’m very sensitive to medicine and my side affects were mild fatigue, headache, loss of appetite. Nothing major at all. I’ve taken it 3 times now. I highly recommend.",Emma

I started taking it right after a meal and after the third dose my pain was gone, my urine went back to a normal color with no terrible odor. I’m allergic to almost every antibiotic I’ve ever taken since I was little but I had little to no reaction with this one.

After about twelve hours, I began experiencing chills, nausea, headache and lethargy. I called our clinic nurse line, explained the symptoms and asked if it could be an allergic reaction. I was told that there was a flu bug going around and it sounded more like that’s what it was. After about four more days of continuing to feel worse rather than better, and knowing I would usually normally be on the mend from a flu bug by then, I did my own research and realized these were indeed some nasty side effects of the drug.

The bad side effects are  very dry mouth and dizzy kinda faint, heavyweight kinda body, no appetite, panic attacks  aches all over mostly back a little chest but everywhere and fast heart rate up and down.  Even when I'm laying down constipated and feels like a ball moving around in my chest and body legs and so forth.  It has been very, very scary as I have been like this for 3 weeks after taking the antibiotic. This all started happening and then the symptoms I mean go away then come back I hope this goes away soon.

About day three on I got really sick, really bad nausea and upper belly ache, pounding headaches, felt lightheaded.  I couldn’t function, had to lay down and rest all of the time.  I realized I was halfway through the dosage and thought I could tough it out, but had to stop at day six, (7 day dosage).

I have never been sensitive to antibiotics and can take (amoxicillin, Cipro, penicillin, Zpak are fine). But this antibiotic made me miserable. The morning after my first dose I had a terrible headache that lasted the whole time I was on the drug. I had to take Motrin for the headaches.  I was so nauseas I threw up several times, even when I took food with the Macrobid.  By the third day I was so weak I could barely get out of bed.  The nausea was severe I could not eat.  I literally forced a piece of bread down when I took the pill.  I was sleepy and confused and not even alert enough to do my work. I finally called on the 5th day to ask my doctor to prescribe me something for the horrible nausea, and he told me to stop taking the Macrobid.  The only plus of this medicine was that it took my infection away, but I'd never take it again. I'm 5'3 and 125 pounds.",BirdG

I was actually suicidal and very depressed.  Of course it went away.  6 months later I had the same thing happen again.. then again a few months later.  The last time I connected the dots about the depression and the drug. Checked with the drug store and found that each time I took that drug for a UTI I got very, very depressed.

It did not clear up my UTI, and it got worse again. I talked to a friend who had been prescribed it multiple times, and it never works for her and caused a kidney infection due to its impotency. I read online that it doesn't work for older women, but we are in our early 20's, so it's not just older women. I do not recommend Macrobid especially after reading all of these other reviews.

UTI symptoms subsided.  On the 4th day I took with a small breakfast and experienced dizziness and heart pressure.  I called the doctor who said that I was on it long enough and to stop.  A decade or more ago I took Cipro with no side effects for UTI but now they say Macrobid is better due to antibiotic resistance and targeting UTIs specifically.  The dizziness and heart pressure side effects were enough to make me stop and re-consider ever being on this medicine in the future.,Dizzy but UTI better

I was given antibiotics when I was in the hospital, I seemed to do okay on those. When I was released they gave me Macrobid to clear up the remaining infection.

53,Macrobid,Bladder Infection,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 16, 2019",16,"For everyone that think the drug doesn’t work, make sure you have had a urine culture done! It is not for all bacteria. Because I had an indwelling catheter, & signs of a UTI, the dr had me give a urine sample, but it takes 72 hours for the cultures to grow. Then he put me on Macrobid twice a day. By the time the culture got back, they realized that it was not going to work on the type of bacteria that I had (group b strep). So I was switched to Keflex. When I was done with that, I was put back on Macrobid to prevent an infection, because I am now catheterizing intermittently. So, make sure you are getting cultures done before blaming the doctor or the drug on not working well for you. Also, Azo (Pyrideum) can be bought over the counter to help with bladder spasms and pain. As for side effects, I have had an incident of dizziness and low blood pressure and racing pulse, but I am not sure if that could have just been attributed to the infection and the fact that I was post operative.",CG

62,Macrobid,Bladder Infection,9.0,,"November 11, 2018",149,"MOST reviews on the internet are going to be more negative than positive. If you had a bad experience your more likely to share than if the experience was fine. There are thousands of people using these meds everyday and they are fine so you never read about it. Let me reassure you it worked just fine. I always ate food WITH it, and drank lots of water and took a daily probiotic. I had a mild headache the 2nd day, and a little stomach cramps/loose stools by the 4th day, but nothing that major. It took 4 days for my UTI symptoms to go away and by the last day, day 7, back to normal. Some of the negative symptoms people describe are also the same symptoms you get when your UTI gets advanced or worse..not every antibiotic will work for every infection. Not necessarily a bad reaction, just not working. This med has been around for 50+years, and targets your urinary tract. It gets filtered thru your kidneys and gets right to the source.
