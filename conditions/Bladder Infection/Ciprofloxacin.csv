1,Ciprofloxacin,Bladder Infection,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 15, 2022",0,"I had left a earlier review when starting.  I was prescribed this medication 500mg twice a day for 5 days. For the first 3 days it gave me a terrible fever, 103, 102.9, 102.8.  I then did research and took a over the counter tylenol with the prescribed medication which helped with the fevers.  This medication also gave me severe nausea, I was only eating two pieces of dry toast twice a day.  I will not be using this medication again, hope it helps others though.  Two weeks out and the infection has gotten a little better but not gone.",Collie

Also,4 months later I have trigger finger where I can barely move my right index finger and will likely require surgery on it.  I woke up unable to move my finger and it only gets worse everyday.  It is hugely painful to ""unlock it"" and only works for about 2 hours before having to carry out the procedure again.  I don't believe many younger doctors like prescribing this anymore.  Baclofen is a much safer choice and should certainly be tried first.  I have bad reactions to baclofen as well.  Like really bad.  But at least they go away after a week being off it!",Jo Ey
