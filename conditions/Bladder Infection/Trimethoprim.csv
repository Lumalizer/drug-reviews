The UTI may be preferable but on the positive side it is very effective for weight loss as I can't bear the sight or smell of food.  For the first time in my life I may cut the recommended treatment  short.  It did get rid of the UTI though.",Anonymous

7,Trimethoprim,Bladder Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 19, 2021",1,"Desperate have read comments which leads me to believe trimethoprim might be making me feel so  dreadful. I have prostatitis and have just done my 3rd week on this drug having been on ciprofloxin for 10 days prior to the trimethoprim( changed due to possible tendon problems taking Ciprofloxin)-- became constipated within 2 days tried to tough it out with combination of laxatives but just feel dragged down very anxious, morbid thoughts, no energy and now shaky and worried about the persistent pain. I hope this is the cause of my problems others have intimated, so that if I stop it these problems will go away",Fox

First course I was prescribed had no side effects but the next time one 200mg tablet gave me a very painful headache that I could not get rid of using paracetamol, ibuprofen, or cocodamol.

10,Trimethoprim,Bladder Infection,1.0,,"December 11, 2020",9,"I wish I had seen these comments before I took Trimethoprim, which was several years ago now.It affected me really quickly too and within about an hour I also experienced negative effects from this drug. Never again!  High anxiety and random thoughts. Had to keep  the light on all night as I was so afraid. Extremely fatigued, and depressed too. Senses heightened greatly and at times had sudden surges of energy doing bizarre things. Thought I was having some sort of a breakdown. Took it for a few days and then stopped. It left me feeling  awful for several days. Put on another drug which worked well on the infection without such negative side effects.",Alarming
11,Trimethoprim,Bladder Infection,6.0,,"November 30, 2020",3,"bladder infection. Almost an hour later I had severe dizziness, hot flashes, extreme anxiety and felt like my blood pressure had dropped drastically. next 3 days I had a horrible headache, nausea, the worst fatigue ever, completely no appetite and severe anxiety. kidneys were very painful, hard to breathe without exacerbating the pain. 4th night I experienced all that and insomnia/strange random thoughts at night that seemed to have a mind of their own Day5 I feel much more like myself but still delicate. I notified my dr and NHs24 about my symptoms and they said to keep taking it! Glad I did because I am feeling much better now. look up ""bacteria die-off symptoms"" this maybe what we have been experiencing. Harmful endotoxins from the dead bacteria in our systems due to antibiotics. I've read the worse you feel during die-off, the more you needed it. Take a good probiotic at night to ease  symptoms.",Thissucks

15,Trimethoprim,Bladder Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 8, 2020",8,"I had severe cramp from the neck downwards. I couldn't sit, stand or lie down . It was so severe. I stopped taking it and went to the Doctor. It started easing off but was still there after a day . The Doctor said it wasn't the Alprim and I should continue.

17,Trimethoprim,Bladder Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 8, 2020",14,"I am currently on day 2 trimethoprim.  The 1st day after taking I had slight nausea and felt very drowsy, almost fell asleep in my class but I also walked a lot that day. Took one this morning, fell asleep an hour or so after but no nausea today. I had a really annoying UTI/Bladder infection.  I've never taken an antibiotic before, but I really don't want that damn infection coming back because it sucks.  Protip: If you have an infection, see a doctor ASAP. Don't wait or use over counter stuff. Thought mine had gone, a week later it was back.",radish

The last time I took them I had salmon pink skin, Rash, swollen eyes and lips and diarrhoea. Was rushed to hospital in an ambulance. Would suspect if I took again it would be anaphylaxis.

20,Trimethoprim,Bladder Infection,1.0,,"October 27, 2018",21,"I had other antibiotics before and other medicines  but never had side effects or allergies till I was prescribed trimethoprim. Took 1 tablet and after few hours i started to have a headache not that painful but  after the second tablet was really bad I woke up during that night. The next morning the headache was better and I thought I should take another tablet see how I feel, had it with food to be sure I won't be sick. I regretted it after 1 hour  or so when suddenly I got nausea ,bad taste in my mouth and the worst throbbing headache ever! Couldn't do anything just stayed in bed. Eventually I started to feel better and stopped taking these.Reading other opinions on here, I think they should ban this antibiotic.",Dhfh
21,Trimethoprim,Bladder Infection,10.0,,"March 8, 2016",11,Due to allergies trimethoprim is the best choice for a bladder infection for me. Used once before about 4 years ago after infection from catheter after surgery. Works fine for me and I have not had the side effects some experience. So in my case a very good choice.,lady user
22,Trimethoprim,Bladder Infection,3.0,,"August 9, 2015",18,"I took the 200 mg strength and was given 16 tablets. On the morning in which I took the very last dose I came out in the most horrendous rash I have EVER experienced and have told I must NEVER take that drug again.  The rash - over a period of about 3 hours - spread over my entire body, including my face.  I was hot and itchy beyond belief.  My doctor was absolutely shocked as she said that any reaction usually appears after taking just a few tablets. I'm in U.K. so some questions are not relevant to me.",Nancy Z
