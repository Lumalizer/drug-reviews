2,Fosfomycin,Bladder Infection,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 6, 2022",0,"After 9 days of cystitis went to Dr and was prescribed Fosfomicina.   I was told to take 2 doses over 2 days.   1st dose and I woke up feeling totally exhausted with limbs like cement and my head like a lead balloon.  My memory was impaired too.   But it had improved my symptoms and my urine had cleared.   I felt reluctant to take the second but thought, well, only one more.   Big mistake.   My head is tingly and feels like my brain is been squeeze.  I feel faint and dizzy.  Nauseous.  My arms and legs are tingly.  I dread to think how I will feel in the morning.  It's now after 2am and I am staying up to drink lots in the hope I can 'flush' this out of my body.  But having done the research (I know, after the fact) it seems it should only have been 1 dose and the damn stuff stays in your system for 36+ hours!    I think, probably, the younger patients would suffer less symptoms and it does seem to be a miracle cure for some.",Los Alc
3,Fosfomycin,Bladder Infection,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 4, 2022",0,"I was skeptical of this med after reading reviews but how bad could it be. Plus, I thought one dose is way better than trying to remember more.Buckle up, it's that bad. I'm on day three after taking it for UTI. Within 30 minutes of taking it, I started to feel pressure in my abdomen, shortly after that, I felt like an overinflated balloon. The bloating wouldn't stop. I had been advised to drink lots of water, which I did, and I went from feeling like I had to go all the time, to not being able to at all, which did eventually subside. Make a note, when they say drink lots of water they don't mean just the day you take it. They mean every day for a few days.I woke later that night with diarrhea and it has not stopped since. I also have had a migraine and now have pain in my lower bad. I still have some uti symptoms.",Mnemosyne

I have grown immune or have side effects from all other drugs used to treat this condition. It has a pleasant orange taste (reminds me of Tang) and dissolves easily in water.

I'm 36 paralyzed from the waist down with decreased sensation as of 2 years ago. I can't imagine how these cramps would feel with full sensation. I get complicated UTI's that macrobid, bactrim, cipro, and cefdinir won't treat which is why I was prescribed fosfomycin. I'll never EVER take this again.

In the end it was $32 spent to get a week of misery. Started getting yeast infection two days later which is to be expected with antibiotics . Thought nothing of it . The next day started feeling nauseous but didn’t vomit ..still thought it was a one off deal . Then the nausea wouldn’t stop and I couldn’t get down two bites of food without gagging. Went to the ER and had to get bloodwork and ultrasound to make sure nothing else was causing the prolonged nausea . Finally relieved to get my appetite back a week later good grief.,Black lab Rocks

I have Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, a type of UTI that is uncommon, especially in healthy people. I went to the hospital and was prescribed Monurol. Last night I took it and went to sleep. This morning, I don't feel any better, and my body still hurts internally. On the flip side, I have had no side effects other than numbing of the tongue for 2h upon oral administration which makes sense since I'm allergic to the fake sugar used in the packet. If fake sugars make your tongue feel numb, don't be scared if Monurol has this effect.",Erine

I took D mannose and cranberry for 2 months with no improvement. The pain got so bad a doc I work with sent in Doxycycline - one pill and I broke out into hives with severe itching. I almost gave up until they sent in Monurol. It is absolutely amazing!!! Single dose a week ago and I'm completely better. No more leukocytes or flank pain. Worth the $100 with ZERO side effects.

29,Fosfomycin,Bladder Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 29, 2020",29,"Monurol (fosfomycin):This is as useless as teats on a bull! I am allergic to sulfa and I've had so many UTI's, 8 last year, that every other drug is now resistant to the bacteria. This stuff costs $94 a shot. I've taken it 3 times and I feel better for maybe a week then the UTI comes back. I've done research and in many cases people taking this drug get the infection back in less than a month. I'm at my wits end. I cannot afford this medication again. My only alternative is to go into the hospital for an IV! After doing research I've found that a high percentage of women getting UTIs can trace them back to an over the counter drug widely used for GERD. Esomeprazole which I've been taking for years. It effects the kidneys causing many women, especially in my age bracket, 77 years old, to get reoccurring bladder infections and in some cases, kidney failure! It is impossible to stop this med cold turkey but, unfortunately, there really is no other treatment for GERD.This is so depressing.",Jo
30,Fosfomycin,Bladder Infection,1.0,,"February 9, 2020",10,"I was told that Fosfomycin is as effective as Macrobid, is a one-time use medication, and is a powder that dissolves into 1.5 cups of water. However, my urine would need to be tested to see if I have any culture that could prevent the antibiotic from working. This medication works after 72 hours and is ingested on an empty stomach. If you are prescribed this medication, you're honestly better off receiving an antibiotic that is stronger and not a one time use prescription. Today, I went into another walk-in clinic, explained the situation and the Doctor said that Fosfomycin is not a strong medication. Again, try if for yourself with the chance of this antibiotic not working. The side effect symptoms I had were, stomach cramps and diarrhea. It did subside other symptoms: after one day I didn't feel sick and by day two, I had no burning sensation. However, by this weekend my left side became sore (which is where your kidneys are) and that was enough for me to go see the Doctor.",noel

36,Fosfomycin,Bladder Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 30, 2019",42,"Monurol (fosfomycin):I cannot possibly tolerate many of the antibiotics used for UTI's. Cipro is a dangerous antibiotic and it's no longer the gold standard for UTI's.  I love Monurol  medication because it is a one stop shop for a painful UTI. You pour the orange-flavored granules into 4 oz of room-temp water.  You're UTI will start to go away within approximately 45 minutes. I recommend you NOT having sugar, bread, booze nor dairy for days after using the Monurol.  Reason being that the Monurol  seems to only clear up around 85% of the bacteria that is causing the UTI.  Therefore, you will need to do vegetable juicing and maintain a super healthy diet to allow your own immune system to kick in and help with the Monurol.  The beautiful upside is that she won't have any side effects like you would with Cipro.",TMS
37,Fosfomycin,Bladder Infection,9.0,,"May 8, 2019",17,"I suffered my first UTI a couple weeks ago and because of my history with stomach problems regular antibiotics scare me and since I can't take swallow pills (Macrobid) and am scared of Sulfa drugs I took this. Hard to find BUT AMAZING. I did not have the typical UTI symptoms (burning) I had sudden leg pain and then progressively lower abdomen tightness and pain and then severe back pain. I took this and felt some immediate relief. I still had back pain for a couple days but I drank tons of water and it went away. This tastes super good (can't even tell your taking an antibiotic) because of some bad reviews and because I'm squeamish taking new meds I had a panic attack when I took it like right after, but my mom calmed me down and I had no side effects.
