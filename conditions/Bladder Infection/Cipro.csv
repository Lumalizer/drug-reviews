0,Cipro,Bladder Infection,1.0,,"June 16, 2019",28,"I was given Cipro as I was leaving a hospital where I was treated for a bladder infection. I became confused and nauseous after being on it for 1.5 days and stopped taking it. A little over a week later, I could hardly walk and felt like I had electricity running down my legs. That was followed by stabbing pains in hands and feet, prickling sensations all over my body and patches of burning sensations on my arms, legs and back. It's now almost a year later and I have had to deal with this horror 24/7. Only when I developed overactive bladder along with the neuropathy did I learn Cipro can cause all of my symptoms. My urologist told me this based on my medical history and notifications sent by the FDA to him and other physicians.",Mease
1,Cipro,Bladder Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 7, 2019",25,"I took Cipro for a bladder infection which gave me severe burning pain, depression and dark thoughts. I now have severe tendon and joint pains to the extreme that doctors are diagnosing me with chronic arthritis, severe tendonitis, and there are days I can't walk. The FDA has  double black box warning. NOT good, do YOUR research. This Cipro can change your life over night. I never, ever had joint pain until my doctor was careless the day he prescribed this -  the double black box warning had been issued so prescribers take more  care. His staff never paid attention and here I am living with the consequences. RESEARCH CIPRO, you will be well informed and trust me you could save your own life. Doctors prescribe but  it is YOUR health  so be informed",Eli
2,Cipro,Bladder Infection,7.0,,"June 17, 2018",29,"Unfortunately I can no longer take this drug. This has been my go too for years and was always able to fix me. I suffer from  interstitial cystitis, chronic kidney infections and chronic UTIâ€™s. After 11 days on 500mg 2x a day I found myself in the ER, looks as if the bacteria I have is now resistant to this medication. Please be careful when taking this I know how great it can work but your body can also become rejecting of it as well.  It has given me many side affects at times and other times none at all.  Best of luck to my fellow sufferers.",Renee

4,Cipro,Bladder Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 12, 2017",19,"Cipro is a Fluoroqunilone. The FDA has issued a Black Box Warning -- the most severe warning it can issue -- on all Fluoroquinolone antibiotics because they cause so many horrible, longterm side effects (like permanent tendonitis on multiple parts of the body) that may take years to come to light.",TPera
5,Cipro,Bladder Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 2, 2017",24,Burning sensation when I pee meant a trip to the Dr. The doctor prescribed Cipro 500mg twice daily for one week. Cleared up the problem quickly.,Anon9696

10,Cipro,Bladder Infection,3.0,,"November 18, 2014",47,"Cipro worked the first day for reducing the urgency, but I must not have eaten enough, because I felt like vomiting. The second day I had diarrhea, and the third day, I have the urgency back, but not as painful.",DlReed
11,Cipro,Bladder Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 13, 2014",98,"This medicine gave me the relief of symptoms of pain, urgency and frequency I needed quickly but I felt bad otherwise with overall fatigue and joint pain everywhere.  Seven Days of that was worth it to me to rid me of that infection.  But I worry if those side effects could worsen if I use it again in the future.",carrosa
12,Cipro,Bladder Infection,10.0,,"October 16, 2013",86,"I love Cipro. I have had it several times before for a bladder infection, and again recently after passing a kidney stone. It works so fast. I have nothing bad to say about it, in fact I have noticed that my skin has cleared up, I know it isn't for that but my skin has never been this clear.",Anonymous
13,Cipro,Bladder Infection,8.0,,"May 7, 2013",77,"This medicine gave me quick relief from the urinary tract infection, however I am vomiting and have diarrhea. The pharmacist label said to take on an empty stomach but when I called them, they said I can eat just no dairy.  Hopefully with something in my stomach the side effects will decrease.",Anonymous54
14,Cipro,Bladder Infection,2.0,,"January 23, 2013",88,"I took one dose and within about 3 hours the blood started to clear from the urine and pain lessened; however, soon I got a bad headache, nausea, and chills.  Within about 12 hours from the first (and only)dose I was in the hospital--vomiting and feeling miserable.  Was there for 3 days taking a different antibiotic and fluids by IV.  One week later bad diahrrea, and pain in knee joint.  Must be allergic to Cipro--will remember that for sure!",Tough lesson
15,Cipro,Bladder Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 15, 2012",44,I had a major bladder infection and was prescribed Cipro.  I had diarrhea and dizzy spells the entire time I took this medicine.  I told my new primary doctor to prescribe Amoxicillin.  He told me that Cipro is better.  My former doctor prescribed Amoxil and I never had problems with that medicine.,Dim Sum

22,Cipro,Bladder Infection,9.0,,"October 16, 2010",128,"Cipro is magical when it comes to bladder infections.   Please do not drink milk and please make sure you eat a cracker, a piece of bread or other food prior to taking this medication. It is by far the strongest and most effective for severe bladder infections. Within just hours you no longer feel that constant annoying urgency to urinate and the pain of the oncoming infection lessens the first day of taking Cipro. And, lastly, however most importantly, do not have intercourse for at least a week or longer.",legabeagle2
23,Cipro,Bladder Infection,7.0,,"October 8, 2010",44,It's been three days since I've been on this medicine. First time user also. I never had a bladder infection but it got a lot better than it was the first day with the burning and pain. I am still experiencing a bit of the burning. I am hoping it works and takes it fully away about the time its my last dose. At first this medicine made me nauseous and tired but I drank more water and it seemed to help take that away.,Anonymous

25,Cipro,Bladder Infection,10.0,,"February 28, 2010",53,"I have become very sensitive to ingredients in certain drinks and products. I can no longer take bubble baths or use body washes (anything with scents). I also can't drink any of the energy drinks. From the first time I feel the symptoms (frequency, pain, ""full"" feeling), it's usually gone straight to my kidneys and I'm urinating with blood in the urine. Over the counter mediines don't work with me. The doctor gives me Cipro and Pyridine (for pain/turns urine orange) and it knocks it out fast and completely. Depending on the dose (I get higher for kidneys than just straight bladder), it can wipe out all bacteria (good/bad) and cause a yeast infection. I've been lucky and only have had one.",Anonymous
26,Cipro,Bladder Infection,9.0,,"January 4, 2010",40,"It works every time, however takes about 3-4 hours to provide relief. The only reason why I don't give it a 10 is because it gives me yeast infections every time.",Anonymous
