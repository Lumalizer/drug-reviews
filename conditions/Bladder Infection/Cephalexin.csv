Works great every time and works within hours. Makes me a little tired and a have a bit of a headache, but I think that might have to do with body trying to heal itself. I always ask for it if it will treat the bacteria that caused my UTI. They won't prescribe this for some bacterias...fyi. I like that this drug has been around for years and years. Makes me feel safer abut taking it.",curestheuti
1,Cephalexin,Bladder Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 1, 2022",0,"This was my first time taking Cephalexin to treat a painful UTI. Within 2 days I noticed a huge difference in the pain I had been experiencing. I took 500mg 3x per day and did my best to space it out roughly 5-8 hours. I took each pill with food and water, and waited to take my probiotic until a few hours after. I believe this helped prevent upset stomachs, yeast infections, etc. as others have reported. I’d recommend considering probiotics, especially on antibiotics! I was a bit nervous after reading people’s experiences here, but I was fine.Only negatives: Really bad smelling gas / stinky pills! By the end of the antibiotics, some mild burning was still present at times. Nearly a week after finishing antibiotics, the burning is ALMOST completely gone. I will head to the GP if it gets worse/persists much longer to ensure the infection is cleared.",Tash

I haven’t left me house for years because it’s so bad. I’m terrified of literally everything and taking a new medication is definitely top of my list. It took me a week to actually start taking this medication and I was terrified. Mostly because the last antibiotic I took (macrobid) made me feel horrible where I couldn’t leave bed the whole time. I had 0 side effects from cephalexin, just make sure you’re drinking a ton of water and have no dairy within 3 hours of a dose.",xdoll
3,Cephalexin,Bladder Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2022",0,Hi! I recently had a UTI and they first prescribed me Sulfamethoxazole/ Trimethoprim (otherwise known as Bactrim DS) which was too strong said the doctor in the emergency room. They then switched me over to the 500mg Cephalexin. I actually have had no major side effects BUT I feel exhaustedddddd whenever the medicine is in effect. Other than that the medicine helped me feel so much better within a few hours of taking it and my UTI was cleared in 2 days!,Alli
4,Cephalexin,Bladder Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 18, 2022",0,"I've used cephalexin off and on through the years, and it's always my go-to, other than colloidal silver.  I am concerned about something I'm seeing in these reviews - or rather, not seeing.  I went to urgent care last year in March because I had sudden blood in my urine.  I thought I must have a raging bladder infection, but fortunately the CNP I saw referred me to a urologist.  Turned out to be bladder cancer.  Now I haven't read all of the reviews here, but I saw a lot of reviewers mention bloody urine.  PLEASE!!!  If your primary does not refer you to a urologist - DEMAND IT.  And don't let them blow you off if you aren't a smoker.  I've fired 2 uros and 1 primary in the last year.  All 3 of them insisted that smoking is the only reason I have bladder cancer.  I'd like a load of that delivered to my back yard, please, cuz I want to do some gardening.  I'm in a FB support group for women w/ BC, and only a portion of those women ever smoked.

It took me a couple of years to figure this out. I thought I had contracted another infection but the symptoms start returning toward the end of the seven day treatment period and re-assert themselves fully within a day or two after I have finished the complete course of Cephalexin. (I always complete a course of antibiotics unless told to stop by a doctor.) I've never had the same problems with Keflex, the brand name drug, but insurance companies will no longer pay for Keflex so I try to avoid Cephalexin if the bacteria shows sensitivity to another drug in the culture. (For the last two decades, a culture is always done to determine which drug to use since I am highly allergic to Sulfa.)",Anonymous

I'm at my neighborhood Urgent Care every 4-6 months, and I always ask for Cephalexin, because one,it is the only antibiotic that seems to work without side effects.  I can work and go about my day after two-four doses. Unfortunately, no herbal supplements do the trick. I've tried so many.However, it does take three days for my symptoms along with the inflammation to truly subside. Sometimes, I get a bit anxious, by day three, and then remember, it is ONLY day three. This drug seems to be different for everyone. However. I'm hoping to find a physician who can help me recover for good whether it is a long term use of cephalexin, or something else without side effects. Hope that helps.",Brooke

I get strong jolts down my spine, arms and legs, feeling like someone giving electric shocks during the night which means I cannot sleep. These side effects are less if I take it with food  but it has to be a good size meal which is problematic due to other health issues I have. This seriously effects my ME.
