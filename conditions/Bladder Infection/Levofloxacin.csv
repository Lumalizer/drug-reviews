0,Levofloxacin,Bladder Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 17, 2020",8,"Levaquin (levofloxacin):I was on Levaquin years back and didn’t have a problem. I was given it now at 32 yo intravenously at the ER for bladder infection that didn’t seem to respond to macrobid. It knocked me out! I couldn’t move my limbs or move my mouth to speak I was so drugged. I came to & told the ER dr who said it was fine, take it when I got home. Before I could take another dose I had excruciating arm, shoulder, wrist, hand pain. Never took the other dose. Went back on macrobid until extreme diarrhea day and a half later. I was only one one IV dose of this & I am still having muscle pain almost 4 days later. Not as severe, but wow NEVER AGAIN.",NoMoreDrugsPlz
