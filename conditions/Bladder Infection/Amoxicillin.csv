0,Amoxicillin,Bladder Infection,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 21, 2020",1,"Apo-Amoxi (amoxicillin):I had a very complicated and terrible UTI which was hard to get rid of. Tried apo-amoxicillin in hope for it to clear all the bacteria and end these constant symptoms. HOWEVER this drug did absolute nothing in helping me UTI, I noticed no improvement at all. I took Apo-Amoxi for 6 days, 250mg 3Ã— per day. I got no major side affects except for a mild headache. Now I have been switched to keflex which is way better.",BANSALA

2,Amoxicillin,Bladder Infection,3,,"July 4, 2015",6,"Amoxil (amoxicillin):I had to stop taking this (amoxicillin liquid) after it made my throat swell up and affected my breathing.  I strongly believe that it was the yellow colouring in the medication which caused this rather than the drug itself as I have had allergic reactions to Tartrazine on several occasions and I now read labels thoroughly.  I wish medications could be prescribed that do not have added colourings as a large number of people, like me, are allergic to several azo dyes.",Peggy P
3,Amoxicillin,Bladder Infection,10,,"April 14, 2012",186,Amoxil (amoxicillin):I started feeling better within a half of a day. This was good because I had been suffering for 6 days trying to get into the doctor. I feel much better now with no side effects. I had a terrible reaction in the past to Cipro so I was happy to try another medicine that worked better for me.,Anonymous
