1,Cefuroxime,Bladder Infection,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 24, 2019",7,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):I took cefuroxime , a high dose for a bacterial bladder infection.  I go t a massive side effect of setting my butt on fire. It still burns and I had to take an antifungal to stop it, which  just made it burn less. I'm still using a steroid powder. But I still burn & I'm in a wheelchair.",Spazzma
2,Cefuroxime,Bladder Infection,2,,"March 17, 2019",9,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):I have been on Cefuroxime 250 mg tabs (Generic for Ceftin) for 3 months, and my bladder infection has not improved.  In fact, my urine is more bloody and continues getting worse.  I have told my Dr. and requested a different, hopefully more effective, antibiotic, but she keeps pushing this one.  I am about to change doctors if she does not change it or my condition worsens more.",Dickie
