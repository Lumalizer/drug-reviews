0,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 24, 2022",0,"Macrobid (nitrofurantoin):Just here to talk about my experience so far. I was diagnosed with a bladder infection been in pain for about two weeks. Never had one before, I’m in my late 20’s. The first day I took it with some pasta since you have to take it with food. I felt okay, aside from a mild headache. Next day I took it with a cup of peaches since I had to be to work early didn’t have time to eat a full meal. BIG MISTAKE, you have to take this with a full meal or you’re likely to get nauseous. Not speaking for everyone, but this is what happened to me. Didn’t throw up was just nauseous until I ate something. I felt better after that. I am on day 3 and I already feel the difference, the pain has decreased a lot and I’m going less frequently. If you aren’t a big water drinker, you need to become one. I drink water every day since my job requires me to be on my feet all day, but water does help quicken the recovery process. I still have 6 days but I feel better already!",Anonymous

I don't have health problems, just glaucoma (open angle). I couldn't sleep as I had lower back pains. I had terrible chest pains for 3 hours in the night. I thought I was having a heart attack. I took no more. It is not a good antibiotic and doctors should take heed.",Anonymous
3,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 24, 2022",0,"I've had many UTI's and have taken many antibiotics for it, but have never been prescribed this before. (100mg x2 per day for 5 days) It's given me headaches (which I usually don't get), sinus problems, aches and pains, and I just generally feel sluggish and tired, and have to make more bathroom trips. It has given me some bouts of nausea if I don't eat a lot with it, but if I eat a substantial meal with it, it's not bad. My UTI symptoms are pretty much gone, although I didn't even know I had a UTI at first. It hasn't been the worst antibiotic I've ever taken, and the side effects have been relatively mild, but I will definitely opt for something else next time if possible.",Anonymous
4,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2021",0,"Good Points:  1.THEY WORK !! This antibiotic drug started to clear up my UTI within 24 hours of starting the course. 2. I suffered no unpleasant side effects like some other people have, in fact I didn't experience the usual stomach cramps or mild diarrhea that seems to dog me when taking other antibiotics.BAD POINTS:  1.They make me pee more, perhaps this is a good thing as it may flush out the bacteria quicker, but it is annoying having to get up 2 or 3 times in the night to urinate. 2. They make my pee smell really strange and quite unpleasant, although they don't cause any change in urine colour. 3 They make my skin itch like you'd not believe, ALL OVER !! however I soon worked out that taking an antihistamine at the same time as my tablet cancelled out that problem.",Stephen

6,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 22, 2021",0,"Generic Macrobid- 100mg Every 12 Hours for 5 Days.I was terrified to take this med because of these reviews. I was starting to feel really sick from the UTI and said well I gotta try something before it gets worse. This is what I did, before taking the nitrofurantoin I pre Med my self with Tylenol to prevent headaches. I ate a couple slices of toast, oatmeal, chocolate protein shake, banana...stuff that really is filling. To help with prevention of upset stomach. An hour or two after taking the macrobid I eat yogurt and cheese. This helps from your gut being stripped of good bacteria and helps to prevent C-diff. I also drink water and Gatorade. The first pill I felt nauseous after hour 6 but as the time taking this it seems consuming a light snack when this starts to happen helps subside that feeling.  Also eating nice full meals really helps. It can make you feel a little bit foggy and tired but nothing bizarre. I would take this med again. It worked well. Don't believe the negativity, not everyone will have bad side effects",Lyfes a Beach

8,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 20, 2021",0,I regret reading other peoples reviews before taking this medication. I had NO side effects at all when I took this medicine! I took 100mg in the morning and evening for 3 days (6 pills in total). I ate food before taking the pills to protect my stomach. This antibiotic was invented in the 1950s and million of people have taken it without any issue and some people have side effects.

Unfortunately one of the few with bad symptoms which is why I stopped early. Nausea, watery diarrhea, stomach upset even days after stopping it still. Wondering if a couple of my meals weren't big enough. As well would add a probiotic while taking it if I need to take it again. UTI cleared thankfully so glad as I had pain and burning.

10,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 12, 2021",0,"Macrobid (nitrofurantoin):I didnt have really any symptoms of bladder infection when I went to the doctor. I have IBD so when I had a flare up of diarrhea and stomach cramping, I didn't think it was anything really until my back also started hurting. Doctor confirmed I had a bladder infection & prescribed this drug. Right off the bat, I just want to say if your not allergic to cipro or another antibiotic, I'd try that instead. Also if you are migraine prone I wouldn't try this medication. I’ve never taken an antibiotic that gave me the numerous side effects this one gave me. For now, it’s bearable, but I don’t know exactly why or how it’s causing me to feel like I have the flu. The most noticeable symptom is pain behind my eyes and horrible headache. Also really bad fatigue. I don't have a fever. Bladder infection symptoms are actually mostly resolved, but I feel horribly lousy. I will probably miss work tomorrow… luckily it was holiday today. I will ask for a different antibiotic next time.",katarina
11,Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 5, 2021",0,"Macrobid (nitrofurantoin):I’ve had a bad experience with antibiotics before and held off on taking this for almost two days after it was prescribed for my mild UTI symptoms, due to fear of side effects and hoping it would go away on its own. Well it didn’t and got worse, so I had to take it. Woke up at 2am with lower abdominal pain and awful burning urination, popped one of these pills, and woke up the next day with no more pain, burning, or urgency. It really helped in less than 6 hours. Of course you have to keep taking it as prescribed to make sure the infection is gone, but it got rid of the symptoms that fast. I’m on my last day of taking these and have had practically no side effects. I always took it with a full stomach and had no nausea.I’m not trying to dismiss the negative reviews. It’s important that people know what can happen and monitor themselves. But this is a VERY commonly prescribed med, and unhappy people are far more likely to leave a review, which is why I left this.",Hannah

I have been back and to the doctors countless of times just for them to give me a 3 day prescription for trimethoprim to be taken twice a day. After using trimethoprim prescription over a period of time I became resistant to this antibiotic. I was referred to urology later on after having a brief chat with my GP for me to have an operation which I was told would reduce my chances of getting a UTI again. I can honestly say the operation was a fail as I caught one again just 6 weeks afterwards. Once again I was back at my GP begging for help to put an end to this nightmare. The GP told me they could try me on another antibiotic called Nitrofuran. I must say since I've been trying it I've never had any side effects and once I feel one coming on I instantly take one and my symptoms disappear within a couple of hours.,Anniemarie

When I was done with that, I was put back on Macrobid to prevent an infection, because I am now catheterizing intermittently. So, make sure you are getting cultures done before blaming the doctor or the drug on not working well for you. Also, Azo (Pyrideum) can be bought over the counter to help with bladder spasms and pain.

If you had a bad experience your more likely to share than if the experience was fine. There are thousands of people using these meds everyday and they are fine so you never read about it. Let me reassure you it worked just fine. I always ate food WITH it, and drank lots of water and took a daily probiotic. I had a mild headache the 2nd day, and a little stomach cramps/loose stools by the 4th day, but nothing that major. It took 4 days for my UTI symptoms to go away and by the last day, day 7, back to normal. Some of the negative symptoms people describe are also the same symptoms you get when your UTI gets advanced or worse..not every antibiotic will work for every infection. Not necessarily a bad reaction, just not working. This med has been around for 50+years, and targets your urinary tract. It gets filtered thru your kidneys and gets right to the source.

I’m sure some of the people on here mistake their anxiety symptoms and thinks it was from the meds.  I calmed down I was fine. No side effects. I was scared for no reason. Other antibiotics made me feel so bad and this didn’t. You have to relax and realize a lot of reviews will be bad because people don’t usually right reviews when everything goes fine.
