0,Rivastigmine,Alzheimer's Disease,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 1, 2022",1,"My father’s dementia diagnosis has never been clear. Although treated for Alzheimer’s, he also suffered with hallucinations which was an indicator of Lewy Bodies. My father’s dementia was treated with Rivastigmine for approx 7 years with a steady increase in dosage as the dementia worsened. The last 2 years he was on the highest dose. His  hallucinations had worsened significantly and he became very agitated. He began to climb on furniture. My father was physically fit at this stage.  I asked for a review of his medications to see if being treated for Lewy Bodies rather than Alzheimer’s would be beneficial. The consultant decided to try Memantine. However the consultant abruptly stopped the Rivastigmine. He was never given the Memantine. Within 72 hours my father had severe withdrawal symptoms. He had complete cognitive failure he could no longer walk or talk. He couldn’t support his head and could no longer swallow. He died at age 78 two days later.",Dad GK

She napped less, laughed and actually recalled my brother's phone number. However, after 4 weeks she went up to 9 mg patch and in a few days I noticed she wasn't as sprite. Bit agitated, napping more, unsteady its like she reverted to no treatment at all. See what doc suggests",Sarah

Her mmse scores dropped 10 points within one year(out of total score 30)!  This patch did not stop her decline, and might even promote the decline! Be careful!!",Warmdays
7,Rivastigmine,Alzheimer's Disease,4.0,,"February 26, 2019",10,"75yr old mom was put on the Exelon patch initial dose Feb 2018. Cognitively she remained stable with some decline starting 7 months later & agitation. No doc had mentioned her dose should be increased to the next level until the end of Oct 2018. At this time she was declining cognitively & more & more aggressive towards my father. This aggression & agitation became worse after increasing the dose. But Doc felt it was best to continue. Finally my Dad had reached the end of his wire last week (Feb 22nd 2019) Her behavior so difficult to deal with. Spitting, swearing, punching, uncontrollable at the stores i.e. Wanting to buy so much. He stopped applying the patch 4 days ago & wow she is calmer, easier to direct & foul language has stopped. I'm hoping this lasts & isn't temporary. Not sure at this point if she should go back to the lower dose patch or try Aricept or just leave her as is now with 12.5 Seroquel twice a day & respirodone 0.25mg twice a day",ELLE
8,Rivastigmine,Alzheimer's Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 30, 2018",11,"Side effects and risks make this a dangerous drug to try.  Have your pharmacist check for interactions with other drugs taken.  Bad choice for patients with heart problems, or if on heart medications.  Bad choice if on antipsychotics.  Exelon can cause hypertension and slow the heart and other very bad side effects like tremor and dizziness.  Doctors may not monitor the effects of this medication adequately.  Read about its side effects very carefully.",Ron

10,Rivastigmine,Alzheimer's Disease,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 19, 2017",17,"The patch seemed to make me more clear in my thought process, more aware of my surroundings, and I was able to be more active. HOWEVER, the serious burning on the skin caused me to stop the drug.  For the first 10 days, I did not have skin irritation from the patches; on the 11th day, a patch SERIOUSLY burned my skin, then all the other sites became serious wounds.

When she was given Exelon, she became quite difficult and insulting, so we took her off.  I was experiencing initial stages of decline at the time and so I tried her remaining patches for 10 days, at 4mg strength.  I immediately felt an improvement in clarity and motivation, but I am under heavy blood pressure medicines and so still did not have the ability to do all I wanted.  After 10 days I stopped the patches and quickly went back to my somewhat confused and listless situation.  Three months later I got a prescription and began using the patches again with the significant improvement.  But a 9.5 dose makes me aggressive.  Problem is the price.",THEcondor
