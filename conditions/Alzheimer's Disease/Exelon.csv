0,Exelon,Alzheimer's Disease,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 21, 2017",20,"I used one month's worth of the 4.6 patches without any problems.  I stepped up to the next level (I think 9.5) and immediately had headaches, nausea and tardive dyskinesia.  I went back down to the 4.6 level and now have constant headaches, nausea and ringing in my ears.",Dusty's mom

She resides in a Nursing Home and was admitted 1/13/13. My Dr. put me on the Exelon Patch around that time. I have enjoyed extra energy. I have been diagnosed with mild cognitive loss. I am 63. No adverse side effects from the Exelon Patch. Don't like black gummy circle it leaves on skin.  9/20/2015, I went to my Pharmacy for my Exelon Patch. The script they gave me was for Rivastigmine, with bright RED sticker: A GENERIC EQUIVALENT DRUG has been dispensed of the same QUALITY and at a LOWER PRICE. UNTRUE. It falls off and sticks to clothes. 1st script at generic price, 2nd and on full price of EXELON. Ins won't pay",not number 8

3,Exelon,Alzheimer's Disease,5,,"July 14, 2015",29,"My mother was put on the patch several years ago.  It is difficult to measure it's effectiveness with a degenerative disease, but I think she has declined a little slower than others I have seen.  However, the cost is TERRIBLE even after Medicare Part D pays.",JoanieP
4,Exelon,Alzheimer's Disease,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 5, 2015",71,"Mom, 85, started using the Exelon Patch (13.9) about one year ago and it has made such a wonderful improvement in her mood, quality of life and cognitive ability.  It has given her back a life and provided the family quality time to enjoy her.  Before the patch, her memory was poor, she was agitated and continually negative, suspicious and lashing out at everyone.  Thanks to the Exelon patch, she's able to have a normal, peaceful life, without any type of side effects.  We feel very Blessed to have been told about the patch and I try to inform people with similar situations of the impact it has had on my mom.",Relieved and Happy

7,Exelon,Alzheimer's Disease,8,,"June 5, 2013",31,My father has been on the patch now about 2 1/2 months for Alzheimer's dementia. He stepped up to the 13.3 mg about 2 weeks ago and the patches don't want to stay on. Nurse asked if they could use skin prep before the application; but Novartis helpline didn't answer that question.  They are going to check out the lot the patches came from to be sure it's not a manufacturer issue. ,xeon
8,Exelon,Alzheimer's Disease,7,,"April 17, 2012",65,"I am 71 and my mom died at 91 after a long decline into total dementia, though not Alzheimer's.  When she was given Exelon, she became quite difficult and insulting, so we took her off.  I was experiencing initial stages of decline at the time and so I tried her remaining patches for 10 days, at 4mg strength.  I immediately felt an improvement in clarity and motivation, but I am under heavy blood pressure medicines and so still did not have the ability to do all I wanted.  After 10 days I stopped the patches and quickly went back to my somewhat confused and listless situation.  Three months later I got a prescription and began using the patches again with the significant improvement.  But a 9.5 dose makes me aggressive.  Problem is the price.",THEcondor
