0,Memantine,Alzheimer's Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2022",0,"My Mum had a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s with Mixed Dementia.  First week on initial dose of 5mg and started day one of 10mg.  My mum became more anxious than ever, looked horrendous and was unable to sleep well. She felt sick, had severe nausea and got quite emotional and upset on the drug.  The drug didn’t work for her.  After 8 days, we were advised to stop the drug.  I worried that trying the drug actually made her worse.  Who knows - it’s all just a hit or a miss really. A trial for each person I feel.",Franny
1,Memantine,Alzheimer's Disease,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 26, 2021",3,"My husband was diagnosed at 54 and a year later he started Memantine, as well as Rivastigmine Patches that he was already taking. He was prescribed from 5 - 20mg over the first month but settled at 5mg as felt dizziness and headaches at 10mg. I did feel like his motivation returned a bit and he was doing very well. He had become quite aggressive over the last few months (bullying really), it has been bad. Then he started taking the tablets alternate days, then decided he wouldn't take anymore. Since he has come off them, his aggression has gone and I am so relieved. I do worry that perhaps his cognitive abilities will reduce but so far, they have improved - he has also started taking a cholesterol tablet however so I can't tell if it's the lack of Memantine or the Pravastatin that is helping - he has started putting the telly on and watched a couple of things - which he hasn't done since soon after the Memantine was introduced. I hope this helps. Free in UK by the way.",Jane

Up at night in a daze, highly unusual verbal statements, confusion, decline in balance. Told her doctor about her strange behavior, he totally ignored my comments, said it was dementia not the drug, and doubled her dosage.  On memantine she acts as if drunk or out of her normal state of mind. I would not recommend. Might work better for some.",FamCareHelp

4,Memantine,Alzheimer's Disease,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 16, 2021",25,"Namenda (memantine):My father has significantly improved since taking Namenda and Aricept combined, as well as 24 caregiver support at home. We believe that the combination has helped dad's cognitive function not just by medication alone, but because he had companionship 24 hours a day. Dad was confused, always thought he was at work and wanted to go home. He forgot who we were and even made sexual moves towards people he would not have otherwise have when he did not have Alzheimers. The symptoms or behaviors he still has is occasional memory loss but very little, he is still paranoid and thinks people are stealing from him or going in his property when they are not, and he occasionally still sees people or animals that aren't there. But the confusion of who we were, where he was and the wandering and wanting to ""go home"" even when he was home is no longer an issue. My dad is only 73 and he was diagnosed last year with Alzheimer's.",Surprised
5,Memantine,Alzheimer's Disease,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 29, 2021",33,My wife who has Vascular Dementia/ Alzheimer's Disease . She has tried this drug twice. First time she started on a low dose memantine  and built up to 20mg. Her condition became worse over a period of time. I was not sure if this was a normal progression of her condition. We stopped the drugs and within two weeks she had settled down and things were more manageable. A year later we have tried the drug again on a low dose 5mg . The confusion became worse. So we have stopped them again. It is hard to know if there are any benefits from this drug in our experience.,Leggy

Once she started Namenda within second week it was like she was back to her old self. She was able to get up her her self dressed like she had did prior to the alzheimers. It was truly unbelievable. This medicine has given us more time with our loved one. She was active psychosis delusional, hallucinating 24/7. Unbelievable. I can not say enough good things about this medication. She was tired the first week but that was good rather to rest than to be awake delusional. Thinking she is ready for a increase where she is getting her nighttime/early morning bad dreams back again.  But it has been 2 years since she started this medication.Please everyone please give this medication time to work. It is a miracle medicine. Give it at least 2 weeks same time daily. I read reviews and it can be a mess just after a few days. The med is fully working yet please give it another chance and more time. amazing",Melody

He just passed away from surgery complications but after being off it he was NORMAL. The doctor had him on so many meds, this being one along with Zoloft. These mind altering drugs are BAD! Also avoid Haldol. If you have a loved one PLEASE get them off these, I don't buy into these did wonders for my mom or dad, probably written by the drug companies reps.

11,Memantine,Alzheimer's Disease,10.0,,"January 3, 2020",55,"Namenda (memantine):It was a wonderful drug for my mother, with dementia, at 77.  They first prescribed Aricept, which caused nausea.  Asking the doctor 'what other drug may work'?  She recommended Nameda.  It became a miracle.  It did not rectify some of the mental losses, but she no longer experienced hallucinations (in jail; on a boat).  It came at the end of the year when insurance wouldn't pay for the drug.  So I waited for two weeks without drug to resume insurance at the first of the year.  During this time she regressed mentally.   As soon as I started it again, she improved-true testament.  I was able to have my mom back for two years until stroke.  I swear by Namenda for only my mother.  I tell everyone.  As with any drug, it may not work for others, but it was truly a God-send for my sweet mother.  She and I were lucky.",bill

The side effects are really bad and requires additional medication.  I think that this drug may help in the earlier stages.  Its very expensive and difficult to give.

She had increasing anxiety over time to the point of not being suitable to go to a restaurant. I asked her to go off it for a while. The difference in her anxiety off this medication was astounding. She went back on this medication fearing her dementia was worsening off of it. The family physician prescribed Trazadone to counteract the anxiety. Over a two month period her decline was extremely marked. She did not have anxiety but had a huge decline in memory and personality. She is now off of both meds. and has very low anxiety.
