She was extremely frustrated and constantly asked me why she would shake. When we questioned the doctor about it she said she had Parkinson's. However, during the pandemic, I ran out of her donepezil and noticed that her tremors stopped. I am very upset that her Dr. would assume that it was something as debilitating as Parkinson's and not the medicine. We have not started her back on the Donepezil and she continues to be tremor free.",Thelma

She did not eat hardly at all.  She cried a lot and at night she went completely insane.  She thought I was her mother.  So the doctor took her off of it.

This year previous to this had been very difficult year when her word power left her (she couldn’t remember the name of objects), she could no longer write and was unable to keep her accounting books -  to name just a few issues.  She was also very depressed with no motivation at all.  Since being on donepezil (10 mg) she is much brighter in herself - wanting to do things and go to places.  She has recently had new curtains and blinds put in throughout her house - something she wouldn’t have even contemplated a year ago.  Her writing has improved noticeably and she is attempting to keep her books again although I don’t think this is hugely successful.  She still forgets words.  She says it has given her some of her confidence back.

She couldn't remember words for things. Could only chat with me for 10 minutes before she had enough. Also tired and not interested in much.    Her writing was terrible. She started on 5mg and is now on 10mg. She saw people in her room (that weren't there) when she first started but taking tablet in the morning helped that. Her language has improved immensely. Chats to me on the phone for an hour with hardly a stumble. Is interested in things again and wrote a list of questions to ask her dr without a problem. She even renewed her passport and is going on a cruise to NZ in November with her friend! Don't know how long it will last but we will take what we can get!

Would not get out of bed, her mind was a lot worse than before she started taking it. A month ago she was put on 10mg of Aricept and after two doses was taken to the hospital, she was totally out of control and knew nothing of what was going on.  It is not for everyone.",cjrowland
55,Donepezil,Alzheimer's Disease,,,"August 27, 2010",150,"Aricept (donepezil):My husband was diagnosed 10/21/2009 with moderate Alzheimers.  He was started on Namenda for 4-6 weeks and then Aricept, 10mg.  Before he took the medicines, he was roaming at night and hallucinating.  After he took the medicines for a while, he stopped hallucinating, he wasn't confused as often, he can carry through a normal day, including eating out with friends 5 days a week, helping take care of the grandchildren, 6 & 10, use his riding mower, and yesterday, 8/17/10 he re-spooled his weedeater.  He hasn't been able to do that for a long time.At this time he's suffering with long-time constipation and has just had a positive hemocult (stool test). A colonoscopy is next.  Could this be a side-effect?",katydidit
56,Donepezil,Alzheimer's Disease,4.0,,"September 21, 2009",130,"Aricept (donepezil):My mother was on this as well for 6 weeks when the delusions started. The pharmacist said that it would take a little while to get out of her system. I did see a major improvement in her short term memory! Maybe the drug makers could alter the recommended dosage to once a week since this seems to be a build up before we see the delusions happen. I didn't want to take her off of it because of the improvement, but I did not want her to continue to wander out of the house because of the voices she was hearing.",Cajunchick

59,Donepezil,Alzheimer's Disease,8.0,,"July 16, 2008",93,Aricept (donepezil):After brain surgery my vocabulary and speech became very bad. A doctor suggested Aricept. I didn't notice any improvement in my speech but my kids did. Apparently it works for different things. Because of the surgery my short term memory is out. Long term memory is still there.,yogiman
60,Donepezil,Alzheimer's Disease,,,"November 24, 2007",177,Aricept (donepezil):My father has been on Aricept for 6 weeks and has become delusional especially at night. My mother stopped the medication because he wasn't sleeping at all at night and thus neither was she. I don't see this listed as a side effect and don't know if the change in my father's behavior is related to the Aricept or just increasing severity of his dementia. Will have to wait and see if things get better now that he's off the drug. ,Denise90275
61,Donepezil,Alzheimer's Disease,,,"August 29, 2007",154,"Aricept (donepezil):Mom was having memory problems and was prescribed this drug. By the 4'th week on the drug, she was having delusions. It's been 6 months and the delusions seem  to be reduced, but not gone.  Caffeine seems to add to the problem so we are reducing her coffee. She also seems to get better when she exercises (walking).",Furniture_man
