0,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,1.0,,"October 9, 2021",2,Slow Fe (ferrous sulfate):Horrible packaging. Tried to communicate this to the company - similarly impossible. High percentage of seniors using this. Why make it so difficult? Stupid insensitive management.,HORRIBLE
1,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 3, 2021",1,"Dr prescribed iron and I was feeling better at two weeks. Take 3 months then follow up at 3 months. Only told watch for constipation. 2 months later suddenly began having diarrhea with sudden urge to go… now. This went on for almost a month thinking it had something to do with new hypothyroid med. but honestly it all began about 4 days before I began this med. I was convinced it was to do with something thyroid as the only other thing I was taking was iron & everybody knows iron makes iron stool and doctor told me only of constipation too…this was not the case. I was waiting for follow up with endocrinologist (thyroid doc) To see what she thought, which was scheduled before my reg. doc follow up for iron. She was as confused as me. Between taking iron that supposedly only will back you up & hypothyroid which also slows that down",Ariez2602
2,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2021",3,I started taking iron pills 5 days ago and I woke up this morning with both my ears plugged and I’ve never had plugged ears before! Has anyone else experienced this?,Mack
3,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 4, 2021",5,Slow Fe (ferrous sulfate):My Doctor has me on Slow Fe. At first it was impossible to get them out of the packaging. Then I read the directions. When pulled apart you will see a tiny pair of sissor's. Look for the corner slightly pulled back. Opens very easy. Just peel it back. But watch out those pills are slippery. Hope this helps,missy
4,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 15, 2020",3,Slow Fe (ferrous sulfate):This product is impossible to get out of the package and needs to be sold in an ordinary bottle.,Lisette
5,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 24, 2020",7,"I've only been taking this for about 3 days and it's been a 3 day pure gastrointestinal nightmaree.  Stomach ache, bloating, nausea and the gas!  The gas is out of control and I'm surprised my family still wants to be around me.  I am definitely gonna switch to a non-sulfate version.",Jen
6,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 16, 2020",4,Okay so today when I woke up I had a diarrhea and it made me feel very weak and I lost energy because of taking ferrous sulfate I think. I poo dark and watery and it is really the worst thing ever. I just wanna ask should I still continue the ferrous sulfate? By the way it'll be 4 weeks in 2 days and I felt better but still pale. But now I have diarrhea. What do I do?,Keerah
7,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,1.0,,"September 17, 2020",14,I was told at my yearly doctor appointment I was anemic. Put on this drug for 6 weeks and at recheck she said I needed to take another prescription . At first I did ok with the black stools and just a bit of runny stools. It increased and I was running to the bathroom 6 to 10 times every morning. Everything I ate the brat diet went right through me. I called doctor said  I needed to stop drug. It’s been 2 and a half weeks I’m still having diarrhea. Tried Pepto Bismol. Now trying Imodium. This is horrible. I wish it would stop. And BTW I was not having any systems to make me think I was low in iron. Want to let people to be careful.,Kay

9,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 22, 2020",11,"My 82yr old father was prescribed ferrous sulfate and had horrible side effects. Black,tarry stool,constipation,severe belly pain,green diarrhea and low grade temperature. Unfortunately it took a while to figure out it was the medication. He suffered for weeks before we finally stopped it and still a week before the side effects went away.",Lsorv
10,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2020",6,Do they have lactose in them? Third day taking them and felt so sick I checked the ingredients--they contain lactose.  Iron deficiency is a direct cause of lactose intolerance and its reported that 70% of us are intolerant anyway.  I don't know why they put that in them!! Ask for a lactose free prescription.,Sickofbeingsick
11,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 1, 2020",10,"I have been anemic for most of my life. I’ve had all the tests looking for the reason. I have tried on multiple times to take every kind of iron there is and they all have the same side effect..impacting constipation. I was in a lot of pain from the constipation . I could not go through that on a regular bases. Laxatives, stool softener just didn’t work. My iron was literally gone.  I ask if the iron could be intravenously done and my dr said yes. So I got my iron in my body by infusion. My iron is right on target after 3 15 minutes infusions. Lot more expensive but so worth it ",Frustrated
12,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 2, 2020",16,"I've been taking this for three months now. I no longer feel weak in my chest and I feel I'm getting enough oxygen. Which is great, but my digestive system is so off and I have regular nausea, stomach ache and mild constipation. It's making me miserable as there's nothing worse than nausea.",Sharchar
13,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 16, 2020",16,"Dr thinks bc my red platelets, that were 11, was the cause of too much blood taken through phlebotomy. I’ve been taking Feosol 325mg once a day with dinner. 10 days later, I’m sick with flu-like symptoms including painful diarrhea. I’m to finish this iron course in 3 weeks with recheck labs in a month. If iron fails to correct, it means I’ve graduated to myofibrosis (sp?)Keep me in your prayers pls and I’ll keep you in mine.",CatCo
14,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 11, 2020",9,"Needed for low iron levels. Reduced my period bleeding, extreme bloating and some nausea. Even tried taking it with a meal and lots of citrus for vitamin C. Make stool darker and smellier, I eat lots of vegetables for my normal diet so no constipation was experienced. Stopped after around a week.",Cassie
15,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 10, 2020",23,I was prescribe this medication for iron deficiency anemia. I was scared to take it for so long because of the constipation everyone complains about. I finally took it and haven’t dealt with any constipation at all! I take it with a glass of orange juice to help with the absorption of iron and drink plenty of water every day. Also I eat greens at least once a day. I've only been taking it for 3 days now and I need to take it for a month but so far I don’t have any negative symptoms at all.,Tash
16,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,8.0,,"October 25, 2019",31,"Having suffered with low iron since a teenager, feeling lethargic had become the norm. My eyes looked tired. My body felt tired. My short term memory was poor at best. Concentration lacked massively. At 40yrs, I decided to discuss this with my GP. I mentioned how I was sleeping maybe 10+ hours each night. I work part time. Meditate when I can and generally try to relax. So yes, I have responsibilities but nothing out of my comfort zone. Why am I so exhausted? The findings from blood work - borderline anemic. Tabs prescription- 5 weeks on and I’m being complimented at work for upping my game, concentration is good, memory has improved, I no longer feel as tired and my eyes feel alert. I’m smiling as I once thought the lethargy was me.... it’s not! . I will mention, yes I’ve been constipated, also had a few headaches but nothing that a laxative and maybe the odd headache tablet plus a good diet can’t fix.",Iky
17,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 25, 2019",17,"Feosol Original (ferrous sulfate):My doctor had me taking this twice a day. The first dose in the morning was fine. After my second dose I was so sick! I was throwing up every 1/2 hour for 8 hours. I couldn’t even keep small sips of water down. So, my dr prescribed an anti- nausea drug.  When I picked that up I also picked up a different iron pill. Called Vitron-C. Not sure how these will be because I just started them.",Liz

19,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 4, 2018",25,"If I can say this way, it's nice to hear others comments and realize I am not crazy.  I don't understand why doctor and pharmacists only mention possible constipation and never talk about diarrhea.  I felt like I was from another world.I've been prescribed a few years back the Ferrous Sulfate and from what I remember went quite well.  In the past years again my iron level was low and started again but had constipation and stomach pain.  I then tried Eurofer and a week or so for a few days got diarrhea getting worst and bad abdominal pain.  I have switch to Feramax150 another type of iron supplement that so far is really great.  Although not cover by insurance I rather pay then feel bad.Good luck everyone",Mesange

21,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 19, 2017",42,"I was prescribed to take 300mg a day, along with stool softeners because this product is know to cause constipation. Thankfully I waited to take the stool softeners because I have been taking this medication for 6 days and have been glued to the toilet for 2 of them. I haven't noticed any positive effects from this medication. A full list of my side effects so far have been: feeling like I'm going to throw up, my stomach gurgling a lot, painful gas, and very strong diarrhea (very watery about 4 times in the morning then 5/6 during the day time).",Too much side effects
22,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 18, 2017",57,"I have been taking this medication for about 3 weeks, and I am using a generic over the counter brand.  When I started the medication, I was told to be prepared for some slight constipation.  What I wasn't told was that this medication would cause me terrible diarrhea.  For the last week and a half I have been having watery diarrhea 5-7 times a day, and this side effect is more negative and has impaired my life more than the anemia did.  Got off the medication 3 days ago, but the diarrhea still hasn't stopped, and doesn't show any signs of stopping soon either.  Wanted to write this review for anyone who was only told to expect constipation like I was, it isn't always the case!!",Only One?

24,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,10.0,,"June 27, 2017",40,I had Restless legs. It was so bad I couldn't sleep at night.  The original meds I was taking for it quit working all of a sudden.  I had been taking Pramipexole. My doc said there was nothing else she could do for me. I requested an appt. with a neurologist. He prescribed feosol. It worked like a charm. God bless him as I was in bad shape not being able to sleep and going to work the next day. If you GP can't help you always as for a specialist. I found Feosol at CVS Pharmacy. If you can't find it always ask the pharmacist. It is an OTC MED.,katrinaballarina
25,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,3.0,,"December 1, 2016",34,Slow Fe (ferrous sulfate):The pill  itself is fine..but the package is ridiculous. .the pills are too hard to get out of the package..i had to cut..poke with knive and scissors  etc..please make a more user friendly package  or just put in a bottle..having  arthritis  and less flexibility in my hands..it was impossible  to get the pill out in a solid piece....its most likely my only purchase  of slow fe unless i can find one in different  package,Harleysue

My doctor prescribed stool softeners to take with it as well, so I'm not having any problems with the constipation. My hemoglobin is at a 9 and my ferritin level is at a 7. The very first day I took it I got so sick (nausea, stomach pains, light-headed & sweating). I have to take it twice a day and the side effects are less apparent than before. I hope this works.",dc422
27,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,9.0,,"August 7, 2015",71,"After being terrified of blood tests for years, I finally had one after my fainting got worse and I thought it'd be smart to check it out, I always knew it'd be lack of iron because I'm not a fan of the foods that contain iron. I've been taking the ferrous sulphate for nearly 2 months now and although I feel so much more energetic and no longer get tired at the top of the stairs or faint, I often get awful stomach cramps of which I expect is due to the constipation but I can only describe them as being a whole lot worse then period pains and also a huge lack in appetite. I'm already underweight and I worry I'll get further complications due to not eating other types of food, but all in all the pill have made me feel so much more energised",Lulu0000

29,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,8.0,,"November 15, 2013",100,"Technically this helped my anemia - got me from ferritin levels of about 5 to 15 in three months. Apparently it should have been much more though, so not sure what I did wrong. Anyway, it did help most of my bad anemia symptoms - heart palpitations, restless leg, tiredness when just walking to the shops. Downside is that it tends to mess up my digestion - unlike other people here who said it constipates them, it gives me a diarrhoea, especially when I drink it with juice.",KatKatS
30,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,6.0,,"November 23, 2011",114,"I have only been taking ferrous Sulphate for 3 weeks but have found the results beneficial. My anemia was affecting my school work and social life as I had no energy to walk and it was really challenging me. Now, I can do normal things and don't get as tired - I believe they are working very well.But, I seem to have got the short straw with the side effects. I now suffer from great constipation. I am also nauseous most days and my appetite has been lost. So, even though I have more energy etc., I am still not myself as I am always feeling sick or having bowel troubles.",Anonymous
31,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,10.0,,"August 1, 2011",122,"Slow Fe (ferrous sulfate):I have really bad acid reflux and had suffered from anemia most of my adult life due to heavy periods. Regular iron supplements would irritate the lining of my stomach and cause lots of pain but this product is great. I have been taking Slow Fe for two weeks and I feel better already.  I have more energy, less shortness of breath, less pain in my body and I don't crave for ice anymore. It can only get better. My iron level was 9.0 before starting slow Fe. I will go to my doctor sometime in August. The only side effect is mild constipation.",feelingbetter66

33,Ferrous Sulfate,Iron Deficiency Anemia,9.0,,"October 29, 2008",206,"Slow Fe (ferrous sulfate):I was anemic for years, and thought it was just the way I was.  I had no idea that the soda I was drinking was stopping my body from absorbing iron (and calcium).  One night, my heart rate didn't slow down.  I woke my husband and we went to the hospital.  I found that my anemia was so bad that my red blood cells couldn't get enough oxygen to my body, and my heart was racing trying to get more Oxygen delivered.  The doctors said my heart would have just given up had I not come in.I found ""normal"" iron pills gave me horrible, painful gas.  Slow FE was the only iron that didn't. It's made differently than iron pills and your body is able to break it down without the difficult side effects, but it can cause constipation.  I eat 3 prunes a day.",trasins
