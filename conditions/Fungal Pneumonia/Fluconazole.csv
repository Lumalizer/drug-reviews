0,Fluconazole,Fungal Pneumonia,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 30, 2019",3,"I've been on this fungal antibiotic for the last 5 months for the fungal pneumonia and Valley Fever, and I will be on it for another 4 more months yet.  With any Rx, there are side affects, but they differ from person to person.  Some of mine are kind of weird/funny, but I think it's all manageable:  dry skin, occasional small rash on inside of elbow, male genitalia is colder, genitalia is like when you get out of a pool, certain smell with sweat and urine, and bowel movement (only when I was on a high dose of 800mg).",Me
