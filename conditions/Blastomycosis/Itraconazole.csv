0,Itraconazole,Blastomycosis,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 28, 2021",0,I have been taking for 6 months I was very ill when first started I almost died I have to take for at least one year The side effects are not fun my hair is falling out my neuropathy has gotten extremely worse my hands get very blue and loose feeling my balance is being effected I am very tired my joints are are very painful me my eyesight has been affected with all that said if it is helping get the Blastomycosis out of my system keeping me out of the hospital not on a ventilator I guess I am willing to put up with the multitude of side effects. I take the liquid form 20 mg two times a day so far the scans of my lungs have shown much improvement I just hope that the side effects will diminish when I stop taking the drug,Renee DeGrush
1,Itraconazole,Blastomycosis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 7, 2021",4,"I started a high dose.  Had to stop as my liver and kidney levels went high.  Then a couple weeks later started me again on 1 dose twice a day.  Day 3 feeling sick, headaches, numbness, tingling in hands  tired just not myself at all.  I just sent another message to my doctor to see what to do.  Also I keep feeling like my heart is racing. Iâ€™m not liking it.  That is my body is not liking it.",Bird
