1,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2022",1,Started on 10 mg propranolol twice daily 3 days ago for PVC’s (ectopic heart beats) within 30 minutes I felt flushed snd then so jittery I thought I’d crawl out of my skin. I thought maybe I just needed to adjust to it so kept going. By day 3 I was a mess. Terrible anxiety snd more skipped heart beats. Cardio took me off it. Glad it works for some but not for me,Hudson
2,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,7.0,,"October 25, 2021",0,"Take 10 mg of propranolol at night for treatment of PACs, also helps with blood pressure, seems to help a lot, I still have extra heartbeats, racing heart at times,& don't notice any side effects at low dose.",Char
3,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 4, 2021",25,"Hi all,I hope this helps a lot of people I've searched and searched for information about ectopic heart beats, PVCS ,skipped beats what ever you wanna call them..I'm 31 healthy male and started boxing day 2018 having every day PVCS like really bad daily. Since then to now I've had 2 monitors ehcos and plenty of ECG and discharged from the cardiology twice as they say they are benign. I was put on propranolol started off on 10mg 3x daily then 20mg 3x daily to even 40mg 3x daily when they was at their worse.I still have them every day and they are a pain but propranolol really helps me out so much makes me who I was before these things came along.PVCS really got me down but the grass really is greener you just need to find the balance.. I hope If there are any young people looking for information this helps there are treatments and your not ill there just misfiring like a car engine does all the beat guys",Jay
4,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,,,"September 17, 2021",3,Just want to mention to those suffering from heart rate conditions after Covid. Please read to the search below. It is very helpful to understand and control the situation together with your prescribed Inderal.  Please do an internet search  covid19 and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome are (POTS),Thea
5,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,3.0,,"September 10, 2021",2,"3 days in on a tiny 10mg x2 (20mg total) for arrhymia , I started feeling strange,  lethargic,  depressed, and waking in the middle of REM cycle with heart pounding.I did some research, this medication crosses the blood brain barrier (other beta blockers do not) where it has a direct effect on the central nervous system.  I figured better safe than sorry so even only being on for 3 days I'm doing a quick taper off,  30 to 20 on the first day then waited a few days to drop to 15 , and dropping by 2.5 every 4 days since.   I am down to just 7.5 mg per day I still feel all the side effects that started on day 3.  But I think somewhat careful taper is smart.  More proof you need to do your research and don't trust your doctor knows what medicines actually do. This is a very old drug , there are many better beta blockers that have been developed since. I was told this was a heart medication designed to stop irregular heartbeat,  wasn't even told of any potential side effects or Withdrawals.",Patagonia23
6,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 20, 2021",8,I’ve been on propranolol for a few months now and I can honestly say it is a miracle drug. I developed Afib out of nowhere one day and my heart specialist recommended propranolol 10mg. I still have bouts of afib every now and then but nothing like how it was. Seems to only flare up when I get extremely anxious.,Ken
7,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,7.0,,"June 12, 2021",19,"Have been taking 120mg propranolol a day for over a year now. Was prescribed because my heart palpitations suddenly got much much worse, out of the blue, to the point I couldn't function. Propranolol has calmed the horrible, constant palpitations, however I still get flutters fairly regularly, although on a bad day I can have them off and on all day. But it's definitely improved the palps, just hasn't wiped them out completely. But overall, propranolol does help calm the heart flutters. Side effects I've noticed? not sure. But I seem to tolerate propranolol better than I did Metroprolol, which made me feel nauseous. Propranolol doesn't do this to me. So if you're like me and you're reading up on here because you're a big baby afraid to take a new med, please don't worry about this one unless you already have low blood pressure as the drug can lower your blood pressure. But apart from that, imo, you'll be okay.",danicali
8,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 13, 2021",4,This is making my heart rate drop into the 50’s but I’m giving it more time to work,Erick1521
9,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 20, 2020",7,"Works well with keeping my pvc's at a minimum. And I don't get near as many migraines or headaches. Currently taking 20-30mg a day. Hopefully won't have to take it forever. My anxiety had increased tremendously, so my cardiologist decided to put me on this one. It has been about 3 months. Although I don't care for the side effects of being moody, I'd still say the good outweighs the bad.",Anonymous
10,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 4, 2019",21,"Took propranolol just before Xmas, was just getting the odd palpations, I'm 70 and not on any medications at all, and generally quite fit. My doctor put me on then as he said my pulse was quite fast,80mg one tab in the  morning and one tab night.First tablet OK. But after that never felt so ill, my heart was racing.. Felt no energy tired.. Sick.. Couldn't eat.. I was on them for 17 days, ended up in A&E twice ambulance the lot. Blood pressure hit the roof.. pulse was out of control. And when I came off them I went worse. It is now early March 2019 and I'm just about getting back to normal. Prior to taking them I had low blood pressure. Now it just goes up and down through taking them. Rue the day I was ever given them. Maybe not everyone reacts the same to them and they do a lot of people good.. But  not for me.",Jay
11,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,10.0,,"June 22, 2018",18,Propanolol saved my life having hyperactive Thyroid after pregnancy. My heart is beating fast every morning if I do not take it I feel like I will die. Once I take it I feel perfect. I take 10mg a day for a year now. I hate being dependent on pills but this pill keeps me alive.,Me1
12,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 16, 2017",25,"I have been taking propranolol for about a year and my muscles are very weak, esp. knees/legs. I stay in bed with extreme fatigue several days a week. My vision is blurry most of the time. I don't find enjoyment in things I used to love, and I stay home most of the time. Could these side effects be caused by the propranolol? They are getting worse . I also have some memory confusion and occasional irritability. These side effects are quite debilitating.",Jane Coe
13,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,9.0,,"August 22, 2017",44,"I had PTSD and arrhythmia and years of seeing psychologists, antidepressants, sedatives, even valproic acid, nothing did much of anything good and the side effects didn't outweigh the minimal improvement (improvement being sedation), when I tried propranolol I wasn't expecting much. I took my first tablet and forgot about it, it kicked in on the train and the effect was profound. For the first time I became aware of how much tension I'd been holding in my muscles, how I'd continuously scan for the possibility of threat, I had no idea I'd been doing this only that I'd felt on edge. I felt like I'd been holding my breath for years and had just been allowed to exhale, nothing else worked for me and I was at the end of my rope, propranolol was a life saver.",Alex too
14,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 21, 2017",11,"Worse medication ever! The doc prescribed me it for my tremor and migraines which it did help with. However it gave me awful chest pain and tightness, abdominal pain, constipation, and made my arrhythmia way worse",NOOO94
15,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,8.0,,"February 19, 2014",26,Tried other meds for arrhythmia but all had side effects I couldn't deal with. This one was most tolerable although it causes some fatigue and dizziness at times which are issues I already deal with-Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I try to take it at night or at a time when I can rest after taking it if I need to.,ms. evie

17,Propranolol,Arrhythmia,9.0,,"June 15, 2011",33,"I started taking this several months ago and aside from the partial loss in some sexual stimulation, some itchiness/shaky/light-headedness - this has restored my life. I was a bundle of problems before with a very erratic heart beat, stress off the charts and other depressive symptoms. A BIG thank you to my doctor and anyone that put up with me before propranolol. HIGHLY recommend it.",Changed my life
