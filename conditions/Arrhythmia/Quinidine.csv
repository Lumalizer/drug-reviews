0,Quinidine,Arrhythmia,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 28, 2018",4,"My age :83. Condition of arrythmia since the 1960's when my doctor prescribed Quinidine. As time went on, so-called ""better medications"" have been recommended and I tried many of them without obtaining the same benefits as with Quinidine. Only the Beta-blocker Metropolol is helpful in connection with Quinidine 200mg. I call Quinidine a life-saver. ",housepet
1,Quinidine,Arrhythmia,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 15, 2017",2,"It causes diarrhea frequently,  makes you tired but it considerably lessens my arthymias as the Doctor wanted my heart to stop being shocked from my implanted ICD/ pacemaker.    I'm only in the first month of taking it and if the diarrhea continues the Doctor may be taking me off of it.",Ev.
