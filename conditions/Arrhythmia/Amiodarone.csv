4,Amiodarone,Arrhythmia,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 11, 2021",23,"Amiodarone kept me alive until cardiac ablation. All other rate & rhythm control drugs were ineffective, intolerable, or contraindicated.Side effects were absolutely horrible, especially in loading phase. At the end of loading phase, it was so bad I thought I was going to die and nurse recommended I go to the ER.The only things that allowed me to take this drug were dividing the daily dose & taking it once every 12 hours, taking 300 mg ubiquinol twice a day, taking a supplement with potassium & drinking a lot of orange juice (for the potassium).I have been off Amiodarone over 8 months, & side effects appear to be gone, except for effects on eyes/eyesight, which are known effects of this drug.Amiodarone did a good job of regulating heart rate & rhythm for the time I was on it, but a really rough ride. If something else works, avoid this drug if at all possible: last resort for afib.Only reason for 6 was benefit (life) outweighed horrific side/after effects.",Sam

Side effects are feeling groggy next day and have sleeping problems. So take Zolpidem at times and Valarian Root and Passion flower to get a good nights sleep. Midnight to 9am most nights.  Without sleeping aid I used to wake up between 4am and 5am and not be able to get back to sleep.  Do not like taking sleeping pills but found it very difficult waking at 4 and not being able to get back to sleep. I am 79 years old and have never had sleep problems ever in my lift before taking Amiodarone and Bisoprolol for AF.  It has worked to get my heart rate down from 140 bpm to 65bpm.

He played golf every day and was no longer able to even walk to his truck without feeling like he couldn’t catch his breath.  A lung biopsy was done and he has advanced pulmonary fibrosis. He never smoke and has now been in ICU for 14 days. It’s so heartbreaking. He was a pretty healthy person who loved life and now he is told that the effects from this medication are irreversible.

Just 2 days after high dose injection following cardiac stenting (without informing my Dad of the risks) his lungs started showing opacities (never smoked a day in his life) but they discharged him anyway!! Doctors DO NOT know how to administer or monitor this very dangerous drug. After returning to the hospital with shortness of breath it took them another 4 days to start steroid therapy, by then the damage was irreversible.  He was a very active 72-yr-old which is well above the recommended age limit of 60, and had chronic lung problems since childhood, which was well known by his treating physician.

14,Amiodarone,Arrhythmia,2.0,,"September 13, 2018",45,"I have Parkinson's Disease.  I was put on Amiodarone after developing atrial fibrillation after mitral valve repair surgery.  It controlled the afib but exacerbated all Parkinson's symptoms.  By the end of a month, I was so fatigued and lethargic that all I wanted to do was sit in front of a television set drooling.  My cognitive processes slowed down, my motor coordination slowed down.  I finally decided that I'd try without this drug.  There was immediate reversion to pre-amiodarone levels of motor issues although it took about 6 months to reach full recovery.  I had never had tremors prior to amiodarone, developed a slight tremor in one hand while one it.  This has never cleared up but it hasn't worsened thankfully.  If you have Parkinson's - beware.  This may return your heartbeat to normal, but the side effects are not worth the benefit.",Rindy
15,Amiodarone,Arrhythmia,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 11, 2018",56,"I had persistent AFIB.  If I went into AFIB I didn't drop back into rhythm until I was cardioverted.   Once cardioverted -- I was OK for 5 years, then AFIB, cardioversion, OK for 3, then AFIB--ok for 1 year, repeat--- then OK for 6 months --- then the Doctor tried cardioversion 3 times while I was out and could not get me back into sinus rhythm.  I stayed in A-fib for 1 year--- then started medication under another heart doctor.  At the end of the following year Dr #2 successfully did cardioversion.  4 years without AFIB and I take one 200mg dose of Amiodarone daily but doctor also does blood tests and lung x-rays every 6 months!  I feel great. My friend underwent heart ablation to avoid amiodarone and it was NOT successful and he will have to experience a second ablation and he's already got problems from the first surgery --- along with still having AFIB.

It helped & I went back to him, he told me to continue this dose. I saw him saw him a total of 3x's. At the end of my stay I felt worse. Swollen ankles, shortness of breath, no energy.  I called Dr. left  message & no reply. With added issues (dizziness, blurry eyes, back pain, cough)  I had an appt at home w/my Cardio. He questioned me regarding Amio. When I said my Rx was 800 mg daily he was shocked saying I should have been on that dose for 10 days. He cut the dose in half. My primary ordered many tests. Angiogram, bld tests, Up GI/Colonoscopy, 4 Cat Scans,  X-rays... My liver & kidney tests were high. He lowered my dosage until tests proved Amio toxicity in my liver.

19,Amiodarone,Arrhythmia,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 1, 2018",19,"Had ablation at end of 2015, which did not work well for me. Was prescribed Sotalol for few months, which did not control afib. Then put on Amiodarone. After almost a year still having afib, it finally started to work. Found out it was doing bad things to liver, and also acquired Gastroparesis. Felt that was result of Amiodarone plus my depression. Since this med has a long  half life, I was enjoying not having afib for almost a year, while also learning how to deal with the gastro diagnosis. I still continued Metoprolol Tartrate with Eliquis during this time. My afib returned Dec. of 2017. For now I am continuing Met and Eliquis since I have afib about every 8-14 days.

20,Amiodarone,Arrhythmia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 20, 2017",34,Was in the hospital for AFib with RVR which came on about 3 days before an ablation procedure that had been scheduled for the AFib.  After two days of trying other drugs to keep my rate down and them working but barely the cardiac ICU decided to try this drug to break me out of the rhythm.  Apparently I'm allergic to it because within minutes of starting an IV drip of it I started getting flush and getting that same feeling as when you have the contrast dye for a CT.  Of course we immediately shut it off and there seems to be no lasting problems since I had so little of it.  Definitely can't recommend this drug unless it's an absolute last resort based on my experiences with it and everything I've read after the fact about the side effects,flyinion

Rather, than prescribing a safer drug, her cardiologist prescribed Amiodarone - the drug of last resort. We did not even know that he had prescribed this drug until she was showing certain side effects such as coughing, weakness, swelling, inability to sleep, etc.  Only after I said that maybe there is a conflict in the drugs she was given did another cardiologist take my mom off of Amiodarone.
