0,Premarin,Oophorectomy,4,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 3, 2022",0,"Unnecessary Oophorectomy performed 2000 age 50, still having periods. Hysterectomy too, due to fibroids. Now discover that its possible to remove fibroids, leaving womb intact!  Suffering terribly from symptoms, given 1mg of Premarin.  Over three years I started with severe headaches resulting in projectile vomiting! I was working at the time, so came off it entirely. No good! I tried different drugs, given Climaval fantastic! felt driven, confident, marvellous. Hair and skin glowing again.  So MHRA in UK remove this drug from the market.  I tried many more, I am placed on Premarin 0.3 which makes me feel nauseous, appetite affected as a result, and have  arthritic pain.  However, I stick it out as, mentally, I don’t feel too bad.  The sickness fades, I am now stuck with bloating, flatulence which is noisy and uncontrollable.  Why aren’t side effects removed from these drugs?",Tanya
1,Premarin,Oophorectomy,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 4, 2020",11,"I had a complete hysterectomy when I was 46 yrs. old.  Went on Premarin tablets immediately.  On the advise of physician I have tried several times to wean off.  Unfortunately, side effects were terrible so always went back on until now.  I’m now 74 years old.  I started weaning off a few weeks ago and am now totally off .  Other than a lot hot flashes for the first week (not bad) and now just a few here and there, I’m doing great.  I don’t think it helped my bones as I have osteoporosis and am taking Risedronate for that.",Terlortam
2,Premarin,Oophorectomy,10,,"February 14, 2020",17,"I took Premarin from the day after my hysterectomy at age 45 until a year ago at age 76.  It was trouble free for me.  My doctor finally insisted on changing me from the low dose pill to the cream. Anyway, my bone density tests show my bones to be 30 years younger than I am, my hair is thick, my skin is 20 years younger than I am, I have never had hot flashes or anything one would think I'd have had.  I wish I was still taking  it. But I didn't know about the horses/mares.",Megan
3,Premarin,Oophorectomy,7,,"October 26, 2019",8,"Had surgery in 1985 due to endometriosis.Am currently 72. My dosage is 1.25. A month after surgery I was advised to take HRT 21 days on and 7 off and repeat.That left me with ""PMS"" during the 7 day off period. Dr advised that off time was necessary to avoid estrogen build-up.I decided to take estrogen for 5 days and 2 days off. This has served me well.Through the years for one reason or anotherI would try other products.BUT, I always returned to Premarin: The Brand Name. The generics I tried were always found wanting.Concerning Insurance: while I was employed the insurance was never a problem. I retired at 55 years old receiving Social Security Disability. After being disabled for 2 years one must apply and accept Medicare.Changing all coverages and in my case lessening them.Medicare Part D has been a godsend for many, but not me.",JD
4,Premarin,Oophorectomy,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 26, 2019",11,"Now 73.  Partial hysterectomy at 27, symptoms of menopause and thyroid failure at 35, extreme depression and suicidal at 43.  Doctor tested estrogen and it was almost nonexistent.  I was on the .625 Premarin dosage for about 15 years (thyroid medication was prescribed during that time also) and then switched to .3 with no problems.  I  read that it is not usually prescribed after 70 and asked my doctor what to do, afraid of the symptoms coming back.  She said many older patients reduce their medication, so at 70, I cut back to 3 tablets of .3 a week and am happy to report that I have had no problems.   My EHB covers 80% of the cost.  This pill saved my life!",Kit
5,Premarin,Oophorectomy,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 8, 2018",26,"I took Premarin 0.625 following an oophorectomy at 36. At 58 I was advised to come off it, as I was past the age of menopause but I got really bad Atrophic Vaginitis. I went back on it for another 7 years and have been off for a year. Doctor now reluctant to write prescription as I'm 65. Now been given Vagifem but miss my Premarin so much. Anyone take it after 65? Tempted to buy on Internet but worried that might stop too. No health issues or other medication",Linda
6,Premarin,Oophorectomy,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 23, 2015",47,"After a full hysterectomy in 2000 with both ovaries removed, I was given Premarin straight after surgery. My Dr now refuses to continue the treatment, and her colleagues will not prescribe as I am her patient. Now 3 months without and horrendous problems with lack of energy, emotional outbursts, hot flushes and vaginal skin tearing. Dr. still refuses because of cancer risk. I thought that would be MY choice: for better quality of life. What to do? Flew to Malaysia and bought OTC. Life getting back to normal now. Only side effect may be the slight bloating, but I'm careful what I eat and drink to reduce this.",CherryP
7,Premarin,Oophorectomy,10,,"May 18, 2013",40,"I could not make it through one day without Premarin since I had my uterus removed. I take along with 24 mg. Bio-identical testosterone from Woman's International Pharmacy. Had the surgery in 1973 and suffered for so long, they even told me I had Lyme. I was bitten by a tick and crazy as it seems,  these two hormones cured me. Go figure. I only use ""name brand' Premarin like my mother and aunts used in the 50's when they used to combine Premarin and testosterone in one pill. I used to use that in the 70's 80's before bio-identical hormone cream. ",Maggie llltdia44
8,Premarin,Oophorectomy,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 9, 2013",81,"Premarin is great for reduction of  discomforts caused by  surgical menopause, hair, skin, sense of well being, sleep, moods and energy levels.",I had a complete hysterectomy 10 years ago.
9,Premarin,Oophorectomy,9,,"August 28, 2011",81,"Had ophorectomy 8 years ago. On second week started to have terrible hot flashes, couldn't sleep any more.  Doctor started me on all you can name before trying Premarin. Since Premarin got my life back. Several times again Doctor tried to decrease the dose and ween it, in order to complete stop. I went into deep depression crying all the time and back to nightmare again. So thanks to Premarin I'm a normal human being again. As a floor nurse on a cardiac floor have talked to several ladies in their seventies that still taking Premarin daily.  My actual dose for years has being 0.65 mg daily.",happy camp
10,Premarin,Oophorectomy,1,,"July 16, 2009",34,"In 1971 I had surgery and was put on 1.25 Premarin and told I must take it for life. Now in the year of 2009 looking back on all, I have to say I wish I had refused the surgery and didn't take Premarin. They didn't tell us about the possible side effects in those days, told only we wouldn't understand. I reported side effects to doctors, who did nothing. My huge stomach is finally beginning to shrink after being off Premarin for years. ",sonokee
11,Premarin,Oophorectomy,10,,"December 31, 2008",98,"I have been taking Premarin for (the better part of) 25 years. Due to insurance changes through this time I've been directed to use other estrogens. I will emphatically state that there is NO substitute for premarin. The others gave me breakthrough hot flashes and PMS.  With all of the plumming gone, these were not acceptable being 32 years old. Premarin every day has kept me at an steady keel with no wavering in mood or temprament.",jas-09
