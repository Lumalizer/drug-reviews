0,Estradiol,Oophorectomy,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 24, 2022",0,Estradiol Patch (estradiol):Had the Doti patch which worked wonders then my pharmacy stopped carrying it and switched me to Sandoz without notice. I wasn’t happy with the larger sized patch but needed them so I kept them. From the first Sandoz patch I noticed that they weren’t adhering as well and didn’t want to stay on. Then a couple of weeks into them I started getting the occasional night sweat. A month into them and I can tell my hormones aren’t staying consistent as I’ve become emotional and started having bouts of crying. My skin is drying out as another indicator that these aren’t working properly and my libido is all over the place.,Anonymous

The Sandoz patches worked better than the Mylan but I cannot find a pharmacy that carries them. )I've  called all pharmacies near me including grocery stores and big box stores.) The Dotti patches cause itching and discolor my skin but is preferrable to Mylan patches. I had used Minivelle and Vivelle-Dot for close to 10 years and they worked great without any skin issues but unfortunately I cannot afford those brands now.",sad

4,Estradiol,Oophorectomy,3.0,,"July 26, 2021",0,"Estradiol Patch (estradiol):I was  switched several year’s ago from Climara to Mylan brand. I have found it does not stay in place well, leading to skin breakdown & waste of product. It is foam based & larger than the Climara patch-this prevents adequate adhesion to the skin allowing sweat to form underneath. It’s frustrating and uncomfortable. It takes my skin approximately 3 weeks to recover from itch/rash and associated redness~",Hazel

In the last month or so I have started getting 1 large welt under the patch with extreme itching. Even after I take it (or it falls off) and wash the area well, I still have the welt and severe itching for at least another week. I have tried taking oral allergy medication to help the itching and it has not helped. One time when the patch came off, I got the welt in exactly 1/4 of the area of the circle.  Just like a clock face with the welt between 12 & 3. This does not appear to be a typical allergic reaction. I was a RN and am familiar with skin reactions. I have called the FDA about this and I am completing an adverse reaction report for this product. (FDA.govmedwatch).  If the FDA does not know about this, they cannot do anything about it!",Anonymous

Excessive sweating at night and dry skin was depressing. My gynecologist tried me on different patches and nothing worked then she gave me a free sample of .05 viville-Dot and the symptoms were gone.

9,Estradiol,Oophorectomy,10.0,,"October 8, 2020",22,"Estradiol Patch (estradiol):After my hysterectomy, I was having post-menopausal symptoms. My gynecologist mentioned options and I chose the transdermal patch. Initially, I used Climara because the generics were not on the market. Climara was great. Eventually, I was switched to Sandoz-manufactured patch which also worked great. This year, my prescription was filled with the Mylan-manufactured patch and those patches just fall off. It is ridiculous -- a HUGE waste of money plus all of the symptoms returned. So, I asked my pharmacy if they could get the Sandoz brand but it was on backorder until I believe this month (Nov. 2020). They recommended I check with other pharmacy chains so I did. I eventually found a pharmacy with Sandoz patches in stock. Each pharmacy that did not have the Sandoz brand told me it was on backorder. So I was lucky to find a pharmacy that had the Sandoz brand available. As soon as I started wearing their patch again, my symptoms vanished. I do intend to report the Mylan brand to the FDA.",KDS17

It was working well, and most of my symptoms had disappeared.  My insurance made me switch pharmacies, and I was then given the Mylan estradiol patch.  I had nothing but problems with it.  It would not stick, and  my symptoms starting returning.  I then started having a reaction to the patch.  I would get large red welts  (hives) where the patch was placed, and they would itch terribly.  This is an allergic reaction, not a ""common side effect"" like they list it as.  I ended up switching to pills that don't seem to work as well as the original patch that I was started on.",Diane

The medication itself works fine for me but it hate the patch! It’s on the larger side and is thick and catches in clothing easily. If it gets wet at all it’ll peel right off. The material it’s made of holds moisture and halfway through the week it’s wet underneath no matter how long it has been since I’ve been in the water. I started putting tegaderm over it first thing but even still when I take it off it’s wet underneath and smells.

Immediately after surgery I had hot flashes and high blood pressure. I was put on  Climara and everything was better. My employer changed insurance providers 1/2020 and they no longer covered Climara.  They substituted Sandoz. I started Sandoz in March 2020 after Climara ran out. I noticed right away that the Sandoz patches do not stick. After being on them a few weeks, I’ve had a 20lb weight gain, pitting edema in my legs, hot flashes, and headaches. Went to my Dr and all bloodwork was normal. Thyroid function is ok. The problem is the Sandoz patches. They are faulty. They curl even under hydrocolloid dressings. The inconsistent hormone level is wrecking havoc on my body. I filed a complaint with Sandoz. I now have to pay $150 for climara instead of the $25 for Sandoz. If Sandoz isn’t working for you, file a grievance with the company. They are putting out an inferior product. I’m also filing a complaint with the FDA.",Annoyed

It is ETS (estradiol transdermal system).  It is an (keyword here) AUTHORIZED GENERIC...not just any generic.  An authorized generic is when a brand makes available their name-branded product as a generic and labeled under a different name.  It is 100% the same.  So, please check into getting it. ",DeDe

My skin flared within a day -- and the red, itchy rash lasted a full week, even after I pulled that sucker off.

I've been on it 3 days and feeling crazy. It's a large awkward foam patch that flapped off on the second day.

I have only had a few instances where the patch came off on its own but, at the time, I was doing quite a bit of water activities while on a beach vacation.

Which they didn't. I called and talked to the pharmacist and this issue had happened to multiple customers. But the pharmacist should have verified the patient the box was swapped out, as it was not me. Today I get a letter from Mylan pretty much stating thanks for letting us know, but we don't have a problem. I will not get another refill of Mylan nor ever use another Mylan product.
