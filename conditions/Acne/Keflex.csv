0,Keflex,Acne,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 8, 2019",18,I started taking this medication initially for an infection from a bug bite.   After three days of being on the medication I noticed all of my skin is clear and appears to be glowing and my pores have shrunk so much .  I’m in my early 30s and still suffer from acne occasionally mostly hormonal acne and this is amazing I don’t want to get off of it now. I was on doxycycline for months in my early 20s which also had similar  effect. The only side effects from this medication initially was a headache and diarrhea but that went away after one day and I’m staying on probiotics to help regulate .,Tess
1,Keflex,Acne,8,,"August 23, 2013",27,"I have been getting these painful boils under my arm since I was 15-16 years old. Now I'm 21. Like a month after I had my baby, my face broke out really, really bad. Cephalexin(Keflex) cleared it right up. I don't get boils any more.",jas jas13
2,Keflex,Acne,10,,"June 6, 2011",28,"This was and continues to be the best, long term option for me. I had very little side effects ... slight headache at first but it went away after a few days.",Anonymous
3,Keflex,Acne,2,,"May 11, 2011",35,"After taking doxycycline for a while, my body became resistant to it, so my dermatologist switched me to Keflex for acne. I think I had at least five bowel movements the first day. Eventually, my digestive system became somewhat regular, but then I started getting headaches on a regular basis. It cleared up my acne somewhat, but it was definitely not worth all the side effects. ",ArIckP
