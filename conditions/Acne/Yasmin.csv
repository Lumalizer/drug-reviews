0,Yasmin,Acne,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 24, 2022",0,"I have been taking Yasmin for years. I primarily use it for my skin but also birth control (I’d use another pill if it was just for birth control due to the risks associated with it). Having tried many pills, this has been the best for my skin which I would say is virtually completely clear, I would have acne otherwise (and I’m in my 30s). I haven’t got pregnant yet either so the birth control element is good. I do get headaches with it, but I do with other pills too, and I can’t say with certainty that if I came off the pill that would stop the headaches. My mood seems fine on it, I haven’t noticed any changes and I don’t suffer from depression. I do get a bit of light spotting in between periods but I have had this investigated and nothing concerning has been found. I may have put a bit of weight on with this pill but nothing dramatic and again it’s hard to say if the pill is responsible (the older you get the more your metabolism slows down). I can’t complain so far.",Olivia
1,Yasmin,Acne,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2022",0,I was on roaccutane for 6 months and finished my course almost a year ago. I started noticing I was breaking out a lot more than usual and it really affected my mood. I was also getting irregular periods so of course my doctor recommended that I went on the pill. I’ve been taking the Yasmin pill for exactly a week now and my skin hasn’t been this bad in ages. I’m feeling extremely low all the time and my confidence has been shattered. My sister is on the same pill and it works for her so I’m hoping to see an improvement sooner rather than later.,Anonymous
2,Yasmin,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 16, 2022",0,"I’m in love with this pill! I’ve just started the second pack and my skin hasn’t been this clear in well over a year. I regret so much trying to clear my skin naturally when this worked so effectively and quickly. Side effects were breast tenderness which has gone away now and resulted in larger breasts. Headaches, I didn’t used to get headaches but on the pill free week I had them quite bad and needed to take paracetamol. During the pill days I have mild headaches almost daily that don’t last long and don’t require medication but this is a side effect I’m willing to live with as acne DESTROYED my confidence. I also hope this side effect will go away after a few cycles and also if you take it exactly the same time everyday as the headache is caused by oestrogen withdrawal. Haven’t noticed any weight gain. I previously had very light periods but now I have heavier and longer periods. I didn’t break out at all!",Sophia96
3,Yasmin,Acne,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 8, 2022",0,"I used the generic version for birth control and to control my cystic acne, which had started a few months prior at age 21. The first few months using the pill I didn't notice many mood-related side effects, but experienced pretty severe acne. After about 6 months, my skin had cleared up, but I began experiencing a lot of anxiety and became depressed. I also lost weight around this time, but I'm not sure if this was a direct impact of the pill, or a result of the fact that I started working out like crazy to counteract the anxiety I was experiencing. I had started to break out again (cystic acne mainly around my temples and sides of my face), and my mental health (and sex drive!) had just tanked.This persisted until I decided to stop taking the pill after about 10 and a half months of usage;  I stopped taking the pill March 2021 and since then my mood has improved significantly, my sex drive has improved and my skin has also improved with improvements to my diet and skin care routine.",Mlippy
4,Yasmin,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 4, 2022",0,"I started Yasmin a year ago after at age 30 my skin went crazy and I erupted with cystic acne all over my chin and jaw line. I had always had spotty skin through my twenties but this was next level. My forehead would be super greasy by 9 in the morning too. I started on Yasmin and it took about 3 months to kick in but once it did it was amazing. The pimples stopped and I could go most of the day without having to powder my makeup. One year on and I am a few months into Australian humid summer while having to wear face masks, and have not had a single pimple. I have had no nasty side effects other than nausea the first 2 weeks of starting on it. Periods are so light as well.",Anonymous
5,Yasmin,Acne,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 6, 2022",0,"I would not recommend Yasmin. After being on Sprintec for years and trying Nexplanon. I was put on Yasmin to help with my moderate acne. I started it in Nov 2020. Within maybe 2 months, I saw an improvement in my acne, which was great. Over time, my mental health went absolutely downhill. I found myself crying constantly over everything. I became depressed, VERY anxious, and did not want to spend time with anyone. I would lock myself away in my room in bed. I began doubting all my relationships and questioning everything around me (ie. what was the point of life). It took me months to realize it may be Yasmin. I stopped taking Yasmin at the beginning of June 2021. About two weeks after stopping Yasmin I was feeling a lot more like my old self. If anyone has had their mental health dramatically plummet while taking Yasmin, you are not crazy. Yasmin can absolutely wreak havoc on your emotional well being. Please talk to you doctor about other options. I now have an IUD that I love.",Sammi
6,Yasmin,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 4, 2021",2,"Leaving a review because when I was deciding whether to go on this for my cystic acne I was obsessed with these reviews. I am very happy with the results. I am on Lucette the UK equivalent of Yasmin. The first couple of months my skin did breakout more but over the third packet my skin has cleared up and I haven’t got a single cyst except for on my week off and it disappeared after one night instead of like two weeks. Everyone’s body is different but for me I lost weight, got bigger boobs and clearer skin. I was nervous to start because of the initial bad side effects which I did get such as breakouts and bad mood swings but I’m grateful I went through that now for these results :) hopefully it sticks! good luck",mollypanda

Every day I’m waking up with a new spot and it’s making me feel rubbish. I had a break a while back when I couldn’t get a pill check due to COVID and I didn’t take the pill for 4-6 weeks and my skin was clear. I debated restarting but thought I would due to painful periods. I’m 4+ months in my breakouts are awful and so are my period pains, no idea what to do.",LJB
8,Yasmin,Acne,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 30, 2021",0,"I first started Yasmin after the nexplanon (the implant) which gave me awful cystic acne on my chin and cheeks. My self-esteem was really low, and it really took a toll on my mental health! I spoke with my provider about switching to Yasmin after reading reviews about how it helps with acne, and after 2 months on Yasmin, my face was clear! It was such a freeing moment, and I stayed on Yasmin for 2 more years until I decided to get off of birth control completely due to it causing low libido and dryness for me. It has been 4 months since I stopped taking Yasmin, and I am now experiencing severe post-pill acne. Mostly around my chin and mouth, and it makes me want to take Yasmin again so it will go away lol. But, I will stay strong off it, and hopefully it will clear up with the help of a dermatologist in the next few months. I recommend this for those hoping to clear acne, but be prepared for post-pill acne if you discontinue its use after only a year or two.",Anonymous

10,Yasmin,Acne,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 15, 2021",0,"Been on Yasmin for 4 years now due to hormone imbalance resulting in irregular period, acne and hair loss. With that I’m on cyproterone acetate for 10 days during my period to remove excess DHT testosterone. Within the first month my acne disappeared. However my period is much heavier and more painful now than before I took it. My body doesn’t seem to like Yasmin as my immune system goes on overdrive with Raynauds Syndrome, dry skin, dry tongue, cluster headaches. Hands turn into paper during the white 7 days of the pill. Joints hurt, even my skin turns red in patch like  forms along my face and neck.Doctor advised I see a specialised as it could be Lupus, but that came out negative. Though meet all the physical features of lupus my tests are negative. Did anybody ever experience these side effects whilst on Yasmin? Or is my body just overreacting to the additional hormones?",n
11,Yasmin,Acne,6.0,,"July 9, 2021",0,"Yasmin was the 4th birth I went on for mild acne and painful periods. Most of my friends that have tried this drug complained of becoming very emotional. I had the opposite effect. It felt like my emotions became bland. One the one side it was nice because I wasn’t so affected by stuff anymore but on the other hand it did take away some of the good emotions too and left me feeling dull some days. I did experience a massive increase in appetite. Some days I was so ravenous I would eat a second dinner. I am pretty sure I put on some weight (haven’t weighed myself). As for acne, Yasmin changed my oily skin to a dry skin. I did see an improvement (smaller pores and less blackheads) but unfortunately I still got some pretty bad pimples some months. I was on this pill for about 3,5 months, so I am pretty sure I would’ve seen more improvements if I stuck it out longer. I came off this pill because I decided to quit birth control for good. There are other ways to treat acne too.",Jane Doe

Over the past three months my skin had gotten so much worse. Big cystic spots around my jawline and cheeks as well as small under the skin pimples. I've suddenly started to realise myself changing with depressive moods, anxiety, emotional wreck, weight gain and generally not myself. I will not be taking my fourth month packet as the hope for clear skin is just not worth this feeling. My advice- don't take this pill.",Sophieblake
13,Yasmin,Acne,1.0,,"April 10, 2021",2,I took this pill as I suffer from oily skin and spots.  The sacrifice to clear my skin destroyed my life.  I was fine for the first year then started suffering debilitating panic attacks.  My intrusive thoughts and pervasive anxiety drove me to absolute distraction.  As a 39 year old woman my sebum completely stopped and my skin dehydrated and shrivelled to a point which is not normal.  Do not take this awful drug!! I’m slowly recovering from Yasmin and it’s taken 6 months for my anxiety to subside.  I have absolutely no doubt that this pill caused these problems in my life. It’s not worth it. Do not take it.,KC_80

The first week or so my skin was pretty clear and I originally thought my skin was going to stay like this ... it didn’t. In month 2 and 3 my skin blew up getting huge under the skin spots that were painful and took ages to go away, I realised that I cried almost everyday about it but I convinced myself that it was going to get better as my doctor said it would take 3 months to get better. However, my skin looks 10X worse that it has ever looked before and my period cramps haven’t changed in anyway.

19,Yasmin,Acne,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 5, 2020",16,"I had to be prescribed Yasmin because I was being treated with accutane for severe acne - and you are not allowed to get pregnant. I have been on it since I was 15 (I'm now 21), and overall I have had no problems with it apart from when I first started taking it I had a month long period. It regulated my periods, didn't effect my hair/weight, and I didn't find it had any impact on my mental health (although this may partly be because I was so happy my acne cleared up). I stopped taking it when I was 18 to give myself a break but I found my skin got really bad again, so I panicked and went straight back onto it and it cleared up after a month or so (but I had another month long period). I also find if I miss just one pill I come on my period.",arh15
20,Yasmin,Acne,2.0,,"August 30, 2020",8,"Started this pill about 8 months ago in a bid to clear up my persistent hormonal acne breakouts. From reading reviews I was super hopeful this may be the solution after feeling as if I’ve tried every other option (antibiotics, various creams, facials and diets) aside accutane. Hormonal breakouts is something I’ve been experiencing since I was about 16 (now 23). Sadly this hasn’t helped me. I have noticed no change in my skin since pre taking the pill my skin has consistently broken out throughout which I expected initially but now 8 months in I’m breaking out as bad as ever. Although I experienced no acne change I’ve had no other side effects. However I now worry coming off this pill is going to send my acne crazy as I know transition from the pill off is a huge trigger so now feel pretty stuck!

21,Yasmin,Acne,8.0,,"February 13, 2020",81,"I started Yasmin after suffering from mild acne. I have been on Yasmin for 6 months and my skin has mostly cleared up. First 4 months of Yasmin, my skin was SO much worse, mild acne to cystic acne, with a breakout every few days. Now I am almost at 6 months I stopped breaking out in cystic acne and my skin has cleared up. I think Yasmin takes 6-9 months to see the full effect. The side effects that I noticed in the beginning - breakthrough bleeding, increased hair shedding, went away after the first few months. I feel that I stopped some of the side effects with vitamins and supplements. It is so important you supplement with certain vitamins as the pill depletes these - zinc, B vitamins, iron, vitamin E, D3, etc. I also take MSM (sulfur) which stopped my hair shedding and regrew my hair thicker. It is important to supplement as the pill depletes vitamins from your body. If you are experiencing side effects such as hair loss etc, please look into taking the above vitamins as well as MSM!",Yaz

I had had acne before but my skin had recovered from it. My dermatologist advised me to take Yasmin again as he said it my acne was hormonal. I have been taking it for a month and a half and it has done miracles to my face, I just have 3 spots and scars left.

I initially went on it because I started to experience hormonal acne around my jawline and chin. This has pretty much cleared up now with maybe a couple spots around my pill free week. Apart from that I would highly recommend this pill despite the negative comments I’ve read about it.

25,Yasmin,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 21, 2020",46,"Started Yasmin mid November after suffering from outbreaks of persistent chin acne that wouldn’t go away. First couple of weeks were fine, then came the outbreak, I didn’t break out everywhere on my face just my chin, but it was inflamed & painful, took time to heal, and hit my self esteem big time. I’m 38 always been an acne sufferer, had roaccutane at 21, which worked for a while, but after having my children my chin would flare quite severely. I was on Yasmin years ago and decided to try it again, to try and also help my heavy monthly’s to! I’m now into my third packet of pills and I’ve finally started to clear! No new outbreaks and scarring is fading nicely, my periods have been lighter & in myself it’s the best I’ve felt in a long time with PMS symptoms. For anyone struggling with the initial acne outbreak it does get better, it may not seem so right now but it does, I also used a 10% benzoyl peroxide and simple range to wash my face.

I was 27 years old and had never struggled with acne at all in the past, I was always blessed with beautiful skin. Then out of the blue I started getting spots on my chest and face, quite badly, they were relentless and beginning to scar.I went to go and see a dermatologist and used antibiotics -lymecycline and tretinoin gel. This helped a lot... I was scared that if I came off them then I would be back to square one. I also had the coil as a contraceptive and had read this may be a contributor to the problem. I got the coil taken out and asked for yasmin. I came off the lymcyline and tretinoin and the acne has not returned! Skin has just got better and better. You would never know I had a problem.My cycle is also better controlled, I used to get a lot of break through bleeding on the coil.I am writing this review in hope it may help others!",Becca P
27,Yasmin,Acne,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 15, 2020",7,I was really excited to go on Yasmin because I was so excited to get rid of my acne because I had been using creams and antibiotics for about two years and nothing had worked. The first few months on the pill nothing happened to my skin if anything it had gotten a bit worse. I also couldn't stop crying and got depressed and anxious which lasted about a month. I also gained about 5-7 kg but I didn't care about any of this because I was just tired of bad skin. It was only after about 7-8 months when my skin really cleared up. Now after about 2 years my skin is pretty much clear aside from the odd pimple. I still have this like 3kg that I just can't seem to get rid of though.,Han

Within 3 months all of my acne cleared up which was amazing to see. No pregnancy scares whatsoever. No changes in mood, I do have diagnosed anxiety which hasn’t worsened or improved on the pill. No changes in sex drive. Only gained 3 pounds which didn’t hurt because I was a bit underweight. My only legitimate complaint with this pill is that it makes my stomach bloat quite a lot and makes it generally more sensitive after eating a big meal. I did have some bloating before the pill but I noticed it got worse several months in. Other than that, no complaints.",Violet

At first it looked like it was clearing it, and it was, but it also brought a lot of other problems. I was constantly emotional, always arguing with my friends and in bad moods, and have never felt so low about my body, hair, face etc. Then I started developing rashes around my armpits and on my chest, and patches on my face become crazily dry and began weeping bc they were so cracked and dry. I hadn’t changed my diet, any skincare, and wasn’t taking any other tablets. I also found that I’d lost my sex drive, which I’ve also seen written on a few other comments. I’m not sexually active however I still normally have a sex drive, and I’ve found that nothing has really ‘turned me on’ since taking the pill.

I have been on every antibiotic under the sun and even on accutane (which did work for a while but the side effects were horrible and it came back after about a year). The worst part of my acne was huge painful cysts on my chin. I didn't want to take the contraceptive pill as I had been on it in my late teens and it didn't help my spots and really affected my mood. But about a year ago I felt so helpless with my skin that I started taking Yasmin and honestly I cannot believe how amazing it has been for my skin. The only side effects I've had were headaches and feeling a little nauseous the first month and maybe a reduce in my sex drive. Obviously this isn't ideal but my acne was bringing me down so much that I am ok with this. I think everyone is different so you just have to give things a try but for me it's been amazing.

The only issue I have is when I start to take the sugar pills, I can get horrible migraine-like headaches from muscle tension in my head, neck and shoulders. The Dr suggested this is due to the drop in estrogen. I've found taking a magnesium forte vitamin tablet on a daily basis stops the headaches but I need to take it all month and particularly the week leading up to the sugar pills.

135,Yasmin,Acne,9.0,,"January 2, 2016",10,This is a very good option for acne! I am 18 and I have had acne since around 7th grade. I did not know what exactly was causing my acne.. hormones? the food I was eating? I was not sure but I feel this pill was effective. I am also on solodyn which I love!! And also I use cetaphil to cleanse then moisturize with the silver serum. My routine works very well for me I have not gotten a pimple in a while however I have gotten small bumps along the way. Gaining weight was not a problem at all while taking this.. I even think I lost weight. So I would recommend this and solodyn; they definitely helped with my acne.,Camilaaa99

182,Yasmin,Acne,10.0,,"April 2, 2008",50,"I am 15 and I had a terrible acne problem, I mean it was bad! I tried Proactive to Oxy and so much more. My  mom was spending a lot of money on things that did not work. I went to the dr. He prescribed face pads that didn't work then he prescribed a gel to apply to my face twice a day. The gel worked a little then we went back for the last time and he put me on Yasmin. I noticed a difference about a month after I started taking it. It has also helped with cramps and pms. Thanks Yasmin.",Katiebug359
