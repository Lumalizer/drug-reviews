0,Isotretinoin,Acne,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 26, 2022",0,"I took roaccutane for a year when I was 13 (7 years ago). After going through several rounds of antibiotics and different facial creams without noticing any change in my acne, I was relieved to find a medication that actually helped me. However, in retrospect, I am not sure whether the treatment was worth all the side effects:1. Dry lips and skin2. Worse wound healing3. Hundreds of mosquito bites (mosquitos loved my soft skin)4. Back pains5. Loss of normal ear wax resulting in ear inflammations (This side effect never completely left me).6. Dry light-sensitive eyes7. Weight loss - about 6 kg8. My hair was never greasy ( I didn't complain)9. Easy sunburnMy dermatologist took a blood sample every month to see if my liver was OK, so I think they were aware of  how strong this medication was.",Anonymous
1,Isotretinoin,Acne,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 10, 2022",0,"Started to take Curatane (which btw I can't find this exact brand anywhere on google, it's kind of worrying me), so I started to take it 4 months ago. Started with 40mg (94kg weight), after 1.5 months and blood tests started to take 60mg. 1.5 months later we were supposed to go up to 80mg I just couldn't do that, I said that I'm barely moving, so it is postponed for 3 months for what I understood. For now 60mg.In 2 months from now it will probably go up to 80mg.As is, at first it got worse but now I already see how my skin changes and I get much less acne, not even 1 one active right now!I have lots of lower-back pain and ankles, which I'm struggling to move or even get up of my chair smoothly (basically I'm 26 years old acting like a 70+ since I started the treatment).Also I have noticed hair loss but I'm not sure if it's directly tied to the treatment as my period was late this month, could be both together which made it worse then usual.Also I'm suffering from vision issues.",NoOne

3,Isotretinoin,Acne,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 24, 2022",1,"Accutane (isotretinoin):Accutane saved me… literally. I had painful cystic acne and small pimples on my face all the time. I was in a deep depression and didn’t want anyone to see my face when my skin was bad. I was on accutane twice and it cleared my skin after several months, you need to be patient. My skin definitely purged at the beginning but at the end it was so worth it! Made my skin look like a porcelain doll. It’s better to get on it sooner than later as the longer you wait, the more scarring you are left with for life. It is very drying though and you need to make sure you’re seeing a good dermatologist who has you on the right dose as too high of a dose for your body weight can cause serious health issues.",Ari

This result was no where near worth the mental anguish I went through with the side effects. Horrible night terrors, depression, and several anti-depressant medications after I  completed the medication. It all around changed my personality. No one under the age of 18 should be legally able to decide if they are ready to face these very real and serious side effects.",Ginger Kidd

7,Isotretinoin,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 22, 2021",0,"I am presently 29 years old and I suffered acne from the age of ten. Prior to using accutane, I had periods of remission but also periods of terrible flares where nothing worked. I tried everything from topical creams and gels to herbal remedies to watching your diet to drinking x litres of water a day to washing your face x times a day. I had periods where I avoided looking at my own face in the mirror coz my skin really was such a mess. I'm taking time to describe the agony I experienced coz I want a fellow acne sufferer out there to read this and to know that someone understands what you are experiencing.So I'm three months into accutane and I've never felt better in my own skin. I smile as I write this. I had results in my 2nd week of treatment and then my skin just got progressively better until now my previously oily face is normal without any bumps. None at all. The ONLY side effect I had was chapped lips. Nothing that chapstick didn't handle properly. Thank you God!",lola

Started with my sacrum and SI joints. Then my hips then my knees. Had to go to a chiropractor. It also started clearing my skin right away. I had dry lips and dry skin also. But the joint pain was horrible I couldn't sit without pain. Was on accutane 40mg for two weeks before I stopped and my pain went away, after a week.

People will always write horror stories especially when taking 60/80 mg per day. My skin was very bad acne covered in it and I started my treatment 6 months ago, I started on the lowest dose 20mg and my derm kept asking if I wanted to up the dose to get treatment done quicker. I didn’t want to rock the boat as I was doing so well and am 6 months in and decided to stay on 20mg. Honestly yes there is dryness especially at first but nothing some strong moisturising cream wouldn’t fix. My lips have always been extremely dry from the beginning but lip balm eucerin works a treat!! Yes this medication has its downsides but anyone struggling with the heartbreaking effects of acne.

10,Isotretinoin,Acne,4.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 15, 2021",0,"Accutane (isotretinoin):I felt was important to share my experience on Accutane. I am a 24 year old female and have had acne for over 10 years. I have been on Accutane 3 times. I first went on when I was 16, then again when I was 21 and again when I was 22/23. Each time my side effects have been the same: super super dry skin, bleeding lips because they’re so dry, and big eczema flare ups. There is a major purge phase but you will get through it, and it definitely cleared my skin up each time. Unfortunately my acne came back after 6 months all 3 times, and is now back worse than ever. Each time the dermatologists tried different techniques eg. Staying on a lower dosage for longer on one round, I gradually increased on one round and on the I was on a high dose continuously straight away. It didn’t seem to make an effect on the effectiveness. Mood wise: my acne caused my depression and stopped me from doing things I loved, so my mood was SO much better on Accutane as my skin was clear.",Fed up
11,Isotretinoin,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 9, 2021",2,"I've never written a review before, I always felt others would do it instead but in this case I needed to because accutane saved my life. I was very reluctant to take it, I'd read about the depression, the suicides and all the other grim side effects, so instead I tried all kinds of antibiotics and medications, none of which worked. By the point that I had exhausted all other options and eventually started accutane I had severe acne across my back, chest and face including large cysts on my neck and I was in a very dark place. After 1 month I was getting noticeably less spots and by the time I'd completed the 6 months of treatment I hadn't had new spots for weeks. Whilst being treated I did suffer badly from headaches, joint pain and dryness, however it was absolutely worth it as if it was not for accutane I'm not sure I would still be around to write this review. I 100% recommend it if you have severe acne and despite the bad press about accutane, it saves lives. Acne that takes them.",Apollo

The side effects were some back pain (only in the first weeks) and during the treatment (4th month) only dry mouth and eyes upon waking. I only use hydraboost facial moisturizer and lip moisturizer once a week. My acne was not strong but it was very visible with several eruptions in the T zone, in the first weeks there was worsening with acne 2 large acnes that I never had of this type, but from 2 and a half months onwards it only got better (not that it hadn't worked before).

It’s so swollen that the camera they use for inspection couldn’t fit. Samples were taken and sent to a lab for definitive proof on what’s going on.

14,Isotretinoin,Acne,1.0,,"October 21, 2021",1,Accutane (isotretinoin):Do not take this drug unless you have severely disfiguring acne. The side effects are awful and they can be permanent. I took it for persistent moderate acne and while it cleared my skin it was not a fun experience. I also developed a rare condition called achalasia after I took it which makes it so food gets stuck in my esophagus sometimes and it has really taken a toll on me mentally. Half the time I try to eat I can feel the food get stuck and I have to sit there and keep swallowing till it finally goes down. If you are a parent keep your child away from this drug.,Adam

Dry lips, delayed skin wounds healing and joints pain.I lick my lips every time I need to keep them hydrated, I take chondroitin+glucosamine+collagen supplements for the joints pain and everything is just fine then. Took & taking 100 mg a day (50 & 50), having 125 lb (55 kg) & 6 ft (185 cm). Please note, the delayed healing side effect is amazingly annoying. While taking Accutane, I am unable to do any blood tests. It just won't work. The vein spot will swell like a balloon. Also, a big acne spot which ended, can still be visible on the skin for up to 3 months, while taking Accutane. Do not panic or something. It is a normal process.

I have been taking this since a month now with minimal side effects. Please apply moisturiser and lip balm most of the time during this medication it will help you a lot. I followed this process and it did wonders to my skin. No new breakouts on my skin. Fingers crossed though. It is an honest review from my end as I am still under medication now.

20,Isotretinoin,Acne,2.0,,"August 7, 2021",0,I had moderate acne since I was 14. I tired everything possible. I used to take doxycycline or minocycline for few weeks to clear my acne but they always came back. When I got into medical school I talked to my few seniors who recommended me this drug called Isotretinoin. I went to the Head of Dermatology in our college and he discussed the side effects with me but I took it anyway. Initially it was good with few minimum side effects like dry lips etc. After 3 months I started developing gastric issues like Cramps and Diarrhoea. It got really worse I used to have severe abdominal pain. I went to the Gastroenterologist and he diagnosed with Ileitis which is inflammation of the Small Intestine. Then after that I suffered from IBS which still to this day isn’t in complete remission. I know this is the last resort for many people and it works for many. But trust me the side effects are much worse. Then acne also came back,Jerry

I had dry skin all over, Most dry was my pubic area where skin was red and peeling off. Even my underwear was hurting me. So, I stopped it immediately but it changed my hormone level permanently. I am 24 now and I have a mild case of hypothyroidism. My face is very sensitive to sun. Even 10 minutes in sun leads to sunburn and puffiness. I also have low testosterone.

Pancreatitis only feel like child labor for 10 days then your body just needs to recover from the stomach acids the leaked from my pancreas into my body.

My best friend took it at the same time and now he has Crohn's disease. 2 for 2 for deadly outcomes all to get rid of my acne for a few months then came back anyway.

My skin is now virtually clear with just the odd spot popping up every now and again. I’m on a 6 month course so am confident I’ll be clear after that.

33,Isotretinoin,Acne,10.0,,"May 4, 2021",0,"I’m on iisotretinoin. It really does get worse before it gets better. The first month was very hard on my body but once you get over that hump of getting used to a new medication (especially one this strong), it gets so much better. You need to make sure you keep on your water intake! It takes down most of your side effects! My joints were terrible, I had headaches, vision problems, etc. but once I made sure to up my water intake, all of that went away or got much better. Also, I’ve been worried about hair loss (being a 25yo female) so I make sure to apply leave-in-conditioner and do a weekly head rub to break up the dead skin. Just keep in mind that everyone reacts differently to different medications so some of the bad reviews might happen to you but also the good reviews might happen to you. Keep your doctor informed on how you’re feeling- if you think something isn’t right, stop taking the pill and contact your doctor. It’s as simple as that! My skin is amazing already!",DD

37,Isotretinoin,Acne,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 18, 2021",0,"Accutane (isotretinoin):Accutane saved my life. I had developed severe cystic acne after stopping the birth control pill. For a few years I tried everything (diets, vitamins, topicals, you name it) to get rid of the horrible acne that had ruined my life. I was so so so scared to try accutane, but at this point it was either this or I might as well give up on life. I did a longer course of 20mg a day, I think it was 8 or 9 months. Not all doctors will accept to prescribe such a low dose, but it was what I was comfortable with, and the medication works in a cumulative way, meaning you can take it for longer with a low dose, and the results should be equivalent to shorter treatment with a higher dose, but with potentially less side effects. It's 6 years later and I can confidently say this drug saved my life, my acne is gone and I have not had any severe side effects.",Cleanliving

As I began the treatment, my skin inflamed and had an intense breakout which lasted about 2 months which had managed to get rid of all the acne and all I was left with was dark hyperpigmentation spots. However as the months continued in my treatment, I began to develop cystic acne around my shoulder and back, so bad in fact that they would burst and bleed causing agonising pain for the best part of 3 months. These cysts would later leave me keloid scars I still have to this day. However after my course, it seemed to be too good to be true, for about a year and a half I was clean, enjoying my life, until 6 months ago when I began to develop acne again around my cheeks, jawline and back of my neck.

I can say that Accutane *works* better than any other acne medication (the other medication I tried was Spiro, which helped my face acne by like 75% but did nothing for my back/chest acne). I have tried and I had minimal side effects (dry skin, some fatigue, increased sun sensitivity, dry lips, dry eyes) but that is all. It was all worth it though. It not only got rid of my cystic acne but also got rid of my closed comedones and the sebaceous filaments on my nose. My ONLY regret is not taking this sooner.

My lips on the other hand oh my god stock up on chapstick before starting this! very dry and the corners of my mouth have cracked and it is pretty uncomfortable but nothing I can’t handle.

Anyways, I was always very timid about accutane as well were my parents were really against it. I'm sure if you're reading this, you've heard some horror stories about this medication. A point to consider is that Accutane most likely does not cause Depression (unless you have a history of mental health issues) in most people. However, having cystic acne can be really hard on people. I felt no fluctuation in my mood, and it honestly changed my life. If you're reading this, you most likely have bad acne. It's important to consider all your options before trying this heavy-hitting drug. It should be only used as a last resort.

After a while I started to get tired and would take a nap everyday for about 3-4 hours, lost all my energy and then started getting a sore back especially on the right side and my body felt weak and brittle. My back hurts all the time now while taking these meds. Then after that I started feeling a little depressed but that didn’t last very long.

It basically cured my acne almost completely. I don't have much side effects, if any. I gained quite a bit weight but I think it has more to do with my age and lack of exercise. A lot of people mentioned terrible side effects. I personally didn't feel anything on accutane, which is rare because I always feel something when I take most other medication. My advise is to start off with low dose and work it up according to your weight. Side effect will be minimal with low dose. You can always stop if you experience strong side effects.I was told to take  Accutane  with a fatty meal.This is the best advice that I can give to anyone who suffers from severe acne. Don't waste your time and money with antibiotic and any topical treatment.  You will always have bacteria on your skin. The root of acne  is over-production of oil from sebaceous gland.",Gary

I am light to medium skin tones and would usually get breakouts that would fluctuate weekly causing dark blemished after break outs on my face, shoulders and back. I started the treatment in mid June, taking 20mg every day. During this first month I broke out in a rash, and was advised by nurse that this was common. The second month my dosage increased to 40mg daily, which remained the dosage throughout my treatment. My course was for 6 months and finished in December.

Just started taking drug (30mg as already depressed about skin condition) day 8 and have had massive cystic spots (3) on face but are drying up quite quick. The most annoying thing is these tiny white heads I keep getting around my mouth-edge of lips. I cant help but pop them as they look really disgusting.

351,Isotretinoin,Acne,8.0,,"March 5, 2017",28,"Myorisan (isotretinoin):I had my first zit before I even entered my teens. My dad has ""problem"" skin and blessed me with the same. It was not unusual to see me constantly wiping the excess oil from my face and sporting a huge zit or two. As a young adult, I've tried a ton of those over-the-counter products like Noxema, Clearasil, Proactiv, Neutrogena, etc. But I found that as I got older my acne just got worse. So, I began seeing a dermatologist and we tried several things: doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline, epiduo, differin, tretinoin, clindamycin and birth control pills (for the benefit of clearer skin). And I must admit that some of these regimen helped but the minute the doctor felt that it cleared up enough and stopped the medication, my skin would worsen. So, with my oily skin and now experiencing breakouts more frequently and especially around my mouth and jaw area, I had had enough and decided to try Accutane. Medication: I was prescribed MYORISAN 40mg for 6 months.Experience: In the first month, the breakout could be described as the worse I have ever had. I had developed larger, more painful and a lot more acne than at any time that I could remember. I was so discouraged but had to keep believing in my dermatologist's promise of clear skin. After the first month, the breakout lessened and my skin began to dry out. Now I was required to moisturize my skin which was something that I would have not have dared to do prior to treatment. My lips began to chap and crack but that was easily remedied with chapstick or any other type of lip gloss. My skin was a lot more sensitive than before. I used to be able to wash my face with warm water and a wash cloth, but now the skin was so thin/dry that it would actually damage the skin and develop a scab the next day. I had to wear sunblock and a hat when I exercised in the park. If I didn't wear enough, I would suffer a mild sun burn. I didn't suffer any nose bleeds or depression. As the months went on I became acne free. And I was even told by someone that I had beautiful skin. Can you imagine my surprise?! I was in heaven.My dermatologist recommended that I apply Epiduo and tretinoin to my skin every two days after I took my last Accutane pill. This surprised me because I thought my days of acne medication were over. After I took my last pill, my skin remained clear and dry of excessive oil for a couple of months but gradually I began to develop a few small zits and my skin was becoming oily again. This was not the promise that my dermatologist gave me. He said I'd be acne free and at the very most I would be a small bump around the time of my menstruation. I can without a doubt tell you that is not my reality. It has now been almost 6 months since I completed my Accutane treatment and I am once again carrying around napkins to wipe the excessive oil from my face throughout the day. And there are days when I have several zits on my face at any given time. I don't dare moisturize my already oily skin. But honestly speaking, my breakouts are not to the degree of what they used to be prior to Accutane because the pimples are smaller. But I'm unsure that if it's too early to tell and that maybe with more time it may all go back to how it was originally. I guess time will tell.",dingdong1981

I had to come on here and write a glowing review for everyone who was in the position I was before starting. My flare up began the summer of my senior year of high school and got so terrible when I moved away for college. It was so bad and I was so embarrassed that I moved back home. Huge hard cyst type zits all over my face with redness. No amount of makeup could hide it. I finally made the choice to just do this treatment. It's the best choice I have ever made. I have actually been off of it for almost two years now and still don't get much... a few every now and then but small and hardly ever. The side effects- NOT THAT BAD. Yes I had very dry eyes... but nothing some good drops couldn't fix. I also had a dry nose but nothing some good spray couldn't fix. Towards the end of my treatment I even started my outdoor college soccer practices. I was in the sun, I was running and out of breath, but everything was just fine! The worst part about this drug for me was taking the pills. I have a fear of swallowing pills but I did it with some yogurt and it's no big deal. Here's the thing... FOLLOW THE RULES. My sister took this before me. She ruined it for herself. She decided smoking while taking it is no big deal... wrong. It ruined her breathing to a point where she had to stop the drug... and her skin was much worse than mine. 5 years later she is on it again and doing great. So don't listen to all the scary reviews.

I am coming to the end of my 6 month course and I can honestly say it's been life changing. Before I started Roaccutane, I was fairly depressed and seriously lacking confidence due to my appearance. But after months of failed treatments on various antibiotics, I was referred to a dermatologist who instantly said there's only one way to fix my acne problem, Roaccutane. At first I thought this is the worst case scenario and I'm going to be even more depressed as a result of the possible mental health side affects. Depression has run in my family so I was very worried. However, living like with acne wasn't something I was prepared to do, so I started the course on 40mg a day.The first week I had a headache daily, but thankfully these die off after a week and paracetamol and ibuprofen will take all the pain away. Almost immediately, my lips were cracking and from then on in, I never went anywhere without some Carmex lip balm in my pocket.As the first 3 months went by, I was still breaking out and was starting to think it isn't going to work. However, I'm so glad I stuck with it because now I haven't got a single spot of my face and the scars have faded to the point where you can barely see them! After the third month, my derm upped my dose and I started to take 60mg a day. Luckily for me I hadn't had any serious side affects. Just your occasional nose bleed and dry skin, and sometimes my eyes were a bit blurry but it's not much of an issue.Anyway, I just want anyone reading this that is worried about starting this medication, that not everyone has a horror story about Roaccutane and I couldn't be happier at how it's made me feel!!Don't let acne take over your life!:)",braaad1998

I took it for 5 & 1/2 months, did not see a Dr and bought it off the internet. The Depo shot was my Birth control while taking it. I figured out my own dosage by how much I weighted and I started with 20 mg a day just to get used to it. Then went to 40 mg a day after a month. Then I finished my last 3 months with 60 mg a day, which was the correct dosage for my weight. 130 pounds. I avoided taking Vitamin A and drank plenty of water to help hydrate my skin. The best money I spent as well, compared to the years I spent trying everything else. I was tired of my acne killing my self-esteem, always covering up my chest and back, ashamed to take pictures. I know that depression is a potential symptom, but Taking Isotretinoin brought me nothing but happiness! I started seeing results in the first month. My pores shrank and my oily face and hair dramatically changed too. I have been off the medicine for a month and a half now still No acne at all, like not even one!

495,Isotretinoin,Acne,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 7, 2016",5,So I have cystic acne. I don't break out alot bUT any pimple I do get scars on my face and does not go away. I had tried almost everything from prescription creams neostrata proactive to minocycline amd doxycycline but none of it did anything and I had terrible reaction to alot of the creams and pillsI had been prescribed accutane years ago and read all the side effecst and threw it in the garbage but after talking to a couple doctors and trying almost everything I could think of I decided I would give it a shot. I had tried everything else and the reviews were pretty promising. The first 10 days I had the chapped lips that never stopped and my skin was inflamed to the point it looked like I had a sunburn. The fact that I work in a potash plant didn't help matters. Was like have salt thrown on your wounds and having to wear a respirator was unbearable. Fortunately I had holidays for the next 10 days and being away from work made it easier. My job is very physical so already I wasn't sure this would work. I noticed I started to get a bit depressed which I knew was a side effect but grew increasingly more concerned when  I read it can potentially be a permanent side effect even after discontinued use. 3 weeks in I started to get chest pain and it was bad it would come and go and that bothered the hell out of me the first time I didn't worry about it but then it happened again and much worse. I became very concerned for my heart and stopped taking the pills all together. At that point I was only 3 weeks in and was just hoping I would be ok. After stopping I still had chest pain a few days off and on. Then the other pains started with my back and my feet. At this point I was at work and it was killing me. Especially my feet. They hurt so bad I wouldn't leave the couch when I got home after work and I would just hurt to the point of tears. Painkillers did nothing for me which was highly unusual. I started to do some research about the foot pain and some of the reviews I came across scared the hell out of me. People that had taken accutane only a short few weeks like myself and been in pain constantly ever since. Others who had taken it and could no longer work or do anything. This became terrifying for me as I had not considered that 3 weeks of accutane  could possibly cause me horrid pain the rest of my life. With all the pain and fear I also became increasingly depressed. I spent a lot of time hating on myself and the reviews I read on they were equally terrifying. I was so scared that this was the worst thing I had ever done to myself.Did I mention you absolutely should never drink on accutane. I was on holidays and had one drink and instantly regretted it. Was in bed the rest of the nightAfter a month of all this since I had stopped the pills the pain finally went away and I have never been so grateful. I hoped everyday that the constant pain would not be a permanent thing and fortunately I got very likely.Also would like to add that none of my acne cleared up not that I was surprised. But I now no longer care. That was the stupidity thing I ever did in thinking that I would not be affected by the horrible side effects of accutane. No one thinks it will happen to them but obviously it happens to some people or they wouldn't be listed as side effects and these bad reviews wouldn't exist. To those of you still suffering I hope that your pains go away. I got Lucky and for that I am thankfulIf you are thinking about taking it I wish you the best of luck.

A typical breakout for me would consist of about 10-15 pimples and blackheads on my nose and chin area. I've tried everything from antibiotics to creams/face washes. Nothing has ever helped me. When I turned 18 I decided I had enough with the acne game and decided to see a dermatologist. I was put me on spironolactone 100mg once a day. I took spironolactone for a few years and yes, it did help a lot. My face was finally clearing up and I was happy with the results. Fast forward 6 years and my acne slowly started coming back. I was getting breakouts on my cheeks/forehead and my blackheads were still present (mind you they never cleared up on spironolactone). A friend of mine started Accutane and saw amazing results pretty quick. I never thought I could get on Accutane because they say  ""Accutane is used to treat severe nodular acne"". And while I had what I considered severe acne...I never thought it was ""that bad"". But I decided to go back to my dermatologist and ask about it. My Dr. was extremely supportive and agreed that I was a good fit for Accutane since prior remedies were proven no longer affective. I've now been on the drug three months and I just can't express how happy I am with it! Within a month my blackheads were gone!! That right there was amazing to me. My face is no longer oily and my ""breakouts"" are down to about 3 pimples (which will eventually become zero!). I haven't experienced any weird side effects. I started using moisturizer on my face DAY ONE. I think that was very important because I've never had any bad dry patches on my face. My daily facial routine consists of:CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion: applied to my face as soon as I get out of the shower in the morning (face still wet) or after washing my face at night. Works very well under my make up. I wash my face with Dove bar soap morning and night. For my lips I use Lanolin cream. WORKS WONDERS. Can be purchased at Target, grocery stores, Walgreens...As a conclusion, I'm extremely satisfied thus far with Accutane. My Dr. is recommending that I take the drug for a total of 6 months.

The acne was all over my face, but was mainly present on my chin and cheek area. The pimples were deep and painful, and left scars regardless of whether I picked at them or not. My acne was present year round; however, it worsened tremendously during the winter months. I was prescribed Isotrentinion 25mg twice a day in the middle of November. ($10 monthly!!!) I saw results within the first month of taking it! It was truly amazing. My skin was extremely dry for the first 2-3 months, but nothing too insane. Other than dryness, I did not experience any other drastic side effects from Accutane. No muscle pain, no mood changes.",Banaan

The pain in my body is my biggest complaint- somedays I can barely move, my feet and my back hurt the most with the 80mg dosage and my ability to control my temper pretty much goes out the window...but I know I'm almost done, so I don't want to change a thing.But overall, my face cleared up on my 4th month and that's all I wanted.

From age 12-18 I had struggled with acne and had been prescribed many ointments, creams, and different brands of ""the pill"", I purchased off the counter brands, performed home remedies, and nothing had work. If you have had many failed attempts of curing your acne, I highly suggest to go to your dermatologist and personally ask to be put on accutane.

I think the trick to avoiding all those serious side effects is sticking to a lower dosage. I'm on 30mg a day and it took 3 1/2 months (BE STRONG PEOPLE IT TAKES TIME) and I can officially say I am acne free all over for the first time in 7 years. I wish I could be some sort of motivational speaker for this stuff. If you are thinking about it DO IT! Down side is the dry patches on my arms and cracked lips, the only thing that works is Vaseline. And another upside to it is my hair! It never gets oily! ",XxnicollexX

No alcohol, no unprotected sun exposure, no unprotected intercourse, healthy diet and exercise, and a lot of due diligence . If you're going to go on this medicine, you need to be ready to give up some of your normal routines in order to truly get the best results. If you're not willing to give those things up, you're not ready for Accutane. Be prepared for difficulty in bowel movements towards the end of the treatment - it can be quite painful and can cause small hemorrhages, which (for me) will go away once treatment has stopped.

Then throughout the next few weeks into the third month my acne suddenly started disappearing, and now into my 5th or 6th month I have absolutely no acne, besides the occasional zit. Although I did obtain some sort of rash the doctor said was from the Accutane, we originally thought it was ringworm but its a type of eczema. The doctor said it will go away in a few days with the prescribed cream. ",Good Work

I tried Villantae for 4 months with limited success. I am now back on Accutane 20mg/day for 9 weeks. see how that goes.What helps me most is sunlight - but only moderate amounts - for a max of one hour per day. I do naturally have darker skin.
