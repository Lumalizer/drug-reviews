0,Tazorac,Acne,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 27, 2021",1,"I’m 28 and have dealt with moderate to severe acne since age 16. I’ve done two rounds of Accutane and was put on Tazorac after other retinoids (adapalene, trentinoin) stopped working for me. I was seriously considering a third round of Accutane two and a half months into treatment with Tazorac when I had by far the worst breakout I’ve had since I started using it. Miraculously, I’m now almost at the 3.5 month mark and have barely had any acne in 2-3 weeks, even after stopping the antibiotics I was also taking. If you’re struggling, stick with it at least until the 3 month mark because you might finally get the results you’ve been looking for! Wishing you all the best of luck",GWatson
1,Tazorac,Acne,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 21, 2020",26,"Hi. I have been on Accutane twice, relapsed within three months both times, and used every prescription cream under the sun. I have had moderate acne since I was 11. This Tazorac saved me from my acne. I considered quitting so many times, but having pushed through now at 7 months it’s been incredible. The purge was awful and it took sooooo long to see a difference, but at 6 months suddenly I stopped waking up to any acne. I saw slow progressions up until that point. Please do give it 6 months it really works but it has to get into your skin. Good luck all.",20yo male
2,Tazorac,Acne,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 10, 2020",8,"I have been using Retin-A for awhile (for about 4 years) it started working tremendously for awhile but then it had gotten so accustomed to my face that I didn’t get the long lasting effects that I wanted. It was not until I had a recent appointment with my dermatologist for a follow up and expressed my experiences with Retin-A thus far she had introduced me to Tazorac 1%, after using this for about a month I saw an unbelievable glow and had dismissed all my acne. I highly recommend Tazorac of you would like to see a drastic effect on your skin.",Geraldine
3,Tazorac,Acne,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 13, 2020",14,Great for acne but DO NOT OVERUSE. Apply before bed.Use As little as possible to spread all over affected areas. I used pea size as a rule of thumb but used slightly more as I also had acne and scarring from my cheeks to under my jaw line. Do wait for your skin to fully dry and moisturize after.Follow your dermatologist's instructions. be patient.  I saw very tiny improvements in texture and smoothness every day from starting use but I didn't see anything significant until probably a month and a half in and by 3 to 4 months my skin looks way better. I used this with conjunction with Dapsone  cream in the daytime. One tube lasts for months.,JB
4,Tazorac,Acne,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 2, 2020",9,I used Tazorac after my Accutane trial finished. I was still struggling with cystic acne and felt defeated but Tazorac worked great on my post-Accutane skin. I'm no movie star and my skin is not perfect (I still sometimes get small zits) but it is so much better. It's no miracle drug but it has helped me get my confidence back and now I'm feeling the best I have in years!,Anonymous
5,Tazorac,Acne,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2020",12,"I was at my wits end after spending unnecessary monies on OTC/ prescribed treatments for acne only to be disappointed in the long run. I was losing hope was forced to accept the fact that my horrible acne would remain as it was. Eventually my doctor prescribed Tazorac; I am quite pleased. Cystic acne is minimal. Spots from former pimples are diminishing. For once, I am pleased with my overall skin condition. My face has cleared up drastically, my skin hasn't look so good in nearly 2 years. Overall satisfied Customer:-))",Chrissy V
6,Tazorac,Acne,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 18, 2020",8,"I love this stuff. Only been using for a few weeks and already getting good results. Acne mark are  fading, pimples shrinking. It definitely does dry my face out but if you exfoliate and moisturize you'll be fine",Mlf
7,Tazorac,Acne,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 20, 2019",9,I am really impressed  I just start using Tazorac 0.05 but definitely  can see an improvement  it does purge  your  skin and it is drying  at first but the pimples go away fast and my skin texture  looks  more even and firm hopefully  in 3 months I will be acne free  I was on epiduo  but it stop working  and my skin really was oily,Kris
8,Tazorac,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 17, 2019",8,"Love love love Tazorac. Been using this for almost 2 years and I went from having horrendous cystic acne to having none! After trying so many oral medications, they did nothing but fix my skin in the short term(acne came back right after oral medications stopped) and caused long term digestive issues. Tazorac is the only thing that keeps my skin clear and has minimal side effects! The only side effect I've experienced is dry skin but just put extra moisturizer on and you’ll be fine!",Meme6619
9,Tazorac,Acne,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 26, 2019",28,"This did not work for me. I used it religiously for 8 weeks and it only made my acne worse. I woke up every morning with New white heads, it gave me larger more painful pimples than I had before starting this cream.",Leesh
10,Tazorac,Acne,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 7, 2019",11,"Tazorac completely changed my life when it came to my acne issues. I didn't get acne until my early 20's and by the time I went to the dermatologist, it was completely out of control. I felt so hopeless like nothing could be done to combat my skin issues. I was started on Benzaclin and Tazorac and the combination completely improved my skin. Best of all the Tazorac helps prevent scars and dark marks. Now I just turned 30 and the Tazorac is even helping with fine lines. Thank you TAZORAC <3.",Brittany
11,Tazorac,Acne,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 6, 2019",22,"Love this stuff Tazorac, I tried it a year ago and it dried out my skin so I quit taking it. I went  to a different dermatologist who has me try it again but this time tells me to USE LOTION with the Tazorac and this time it’s working well and my acne is gone and my skin is even.",Mj
12,Tazorac,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 15, 2019",17,"The absolute best thing I have ever done for my skin. I started tazorac about a year ago and my skin has never looked better ever. I’m mid 20s women who never had acne until about 23. I started using this and it completely cleared my moderate/ mild acne. Not only is my acne gone, my skin tone is even. I’ve always had trouble with my skin tone being off, but this literally made my face all one tone and look porcelain clear. Also a huge plus is that this medication is usually prescribed for people with wrinkles to help diminish them and prevent them. Definitely would recommend using at a young age to prevent wrinkles, even skin tone, open pores and clear acne.",Sammybanana23
13,Tazorac,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 11, 2019",12,"HOLY COW! OK I’ve tried everything and my doctor randomly prescribed this nightly and I honestly didn’t think it would work. For some reason this did the trick and every since I started nightly it’s been getting progressively better and my skin is clearer than it’s ever been in my life. I love it, I got some dryness but less is more with the gel. I didn’t have any purging either. If you’re using this keep at it!! You will see results",healed123
14,Tazorac,Acne,1.0,,"December 11, 2018",5,Tazorac made my acne worse. Once I stopped using it my acne got better. It was in use with another topical cream.  It’s very expensive.,Joo
15,Tazorac,Acne,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 28, 2018",13,"This might work for some people, but I did not have a good experience with this topical.I was told to mix a pea-sized amount with a heavy moisturizer and spread it all over my skin. Initially, this was ok, but then my body broke out into a small bumpy irritated-looking rash almost a week in.I immediately went to the doctor who told me that I had a mild case of eczema due to how aggressive this cream is and how sensitive my skin is. She recommended discontinuing it until my skin improved and then only using this once a week until my skin ""acclimated.""Well, kids, the rash went away, but my skin never adjusted to even weekly use. This would make my skin dry, red, stretched and irritated. Consequently, my acne did not improve at all. In fact, I think it may have exacerbated the problem.",George
16,Tazorac,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 18, 2018",6,"Using this product was the best thing I could have ever done for my skin when my doctor prescribe this for me.  I didn't have any side effects as long as I used it as the doctor prescribed the only thing was that when I went to get my prescriptions refilled it cost almost $400 and I could not afford it. If I could afford this cream I would use it forever my skin was so beautiful and smooth the color was awesome. The only reason I stopped using this product is because I couldn't afford it any longer. I went back to the doctor and she had to give me a lower version of  this cream this time it's not worth my time but to anybody needing to use this product please  use it ,it's a good product. Take my advice!!!! You only need to use a small amount at night and it worked great. The cream lasted for at least 6 months",Blessed
17,Tazorac,Acne,10.0,,"June 11, 2018",7,HAVE BEEN ON FOR 9 WEEKS!!!!! So amazed by my results I am shocked and I hardly breakout now. Before I used to get bad breakouts and now I just get a few tiny ones and this is helping with my scarring also. 10/10 would recommend this product to anyone with acne.,Nikki
18,Tazorac,Acne,8.0,,"September 26, 2017",35,"This medication actually works!! After trying too many topicals to count, tazorac is definitely the best. For those starting tazorac reading this review right now, I know how much it sucks in the beginning. The initial breakout can be so horrible- trust me, I've been there. I've cried and not wanted to go out in public but in the long run- I promise it's worth it. Give it about 3 months to officially work and you'll be grateful.",Danielle755
19,Tazorac,Acne,3.0,,"August 7, 2017",4,"I've tried a lot of different acne medications and some have worked for a while and then quit working, tazorac is no different. When I first started using tazorac my face was the clearest it's ever been. Then about 3 months later my acne came back worse. Tazorac is the best treatment I've used so far, but in the end it did not work out for me. :(",casie 23
20,Tazorac,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 13, 2017",45,"I started Tazorac on February 17, 2017. I had bad acne on my cheeks, and tiny bumps on my forehead. 4 weeks into Tazorac yes it did get worse. I didn't want to go to school or even go out with friends and family ! So, I went back to my dermo and he told me to keep my head up and that Tazorac was purging my skin and bringing everything to the surface. Slowly but surely, MY FACE LOOKS AMAZING !! It's May 13, 2017 and I barely have anything on my face and it's as smooth as a baby's bottom. If you're going through the purging stage I know what you are going through but I promise to stick with it and just know that the Tazorac is getting all the gunk out of your skin !! stay positive, drink water, use tazorac !!",Anonymous
21,Tazorac,Acne,1.0,,"April 23, 2017",5,"if i could rate this a 0 I would. I have struggled with acne for 5-6 years now. At the end of October I FINALLY went to a dermatologist. She prescribed Tazorac along with Acticlate. However, Tazorac DOES NOTHING. It is a topical treatment meant to be used at night, it is supposed to help clear acne and scarring. I would use it every night after washing my face. It didn't work...AT ALL. I still get acne and I have been using this stuff for 6 months. I highly DO NOT recommend.",juht773321
22,Tazorac,Acne,10.0,,"January 21, 2017",10,Most amazing medication ever for acne- it feels like it's renewing skin while you sleep and helps to clear up skin immediately-- highly recommend!,Anonymous 2017
23,Tazorac,Acne,10.0,,"November 2, 2016",23,"I am 65, becauses of thyroid supplements, I started getting very oily with lots of blackheads on my nose, lips, & chin & a few small pimples.  Went to my Derm after an 18 year lapse; she prescribed Tazorac; I really wanted accutane which I had taken in my 40's, really good stuff, but she insisted that I try Tazorac at .1%; I love it.  It set my face on fire for about 2 weeks, I used Epionce medical barrier cream to cool it. & help with the sting.  My face was very red too.  After 2 weeks, the burn lessen and now I can put it on several days in a row without the cream.  Been using for 2 mos & my skin is looking fantastic & brighter, I have a few acne scars and they are looking much smaller too.  I am getting complements from family members.",sixdogs4me
24,Tazorac,Acne,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 2, 2016",22,"I was using the 0.10% strength which helped greatly with clogged pores, blackheads, small pustules.  However, I also had cystic hormonal acne, which the cream wasn't effective enough for. I took this in conjunction with spironolactone, but eventually had to take accutane.Downside of this drug: sun-sensitivity, skin peeling, redness For the record, it takes weeks to see results, and your acne gets WORSE before it gets better.",AnSF99
25,Tazorac,Acne,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 5, 2016",15,"I have been using it now for about a month.  I have had acne since I was 11 and I'm now 50.  Nothing has ever worked, ever!  My dermotologist asked me to try first every other day and now I'm using it every day...about the side of a pea and I mix it with my Neutrogena face lotion with SPF sunscreen. I place it on my face and declote'.  It has removed so many sun spots! My face looks 5 years younger...and my acne is healing much faster.  It use to take a blemish, sometimes months to heal!  Now I can see my skin is recuperating faster from blemishes.  Even my best friend keeps saying, ""you look so good today, what  are you doing?"" Ha, I finally told her and she has an appt with my dermatologist now.  I am still using samples, don't know $$",Stazzle
26,Tazorac,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 30, 2012",49,"I've been using Tazorac since March 2012. My Dermatologist put me on Aczone to use in the morning, and Tazorac in the evening. There were some burning and itching in the beginning, but it when away. During my office visits I receive Chemical Peels also. Over a month, I've noticed the dark spots have lightened up and my skin is evened out. Now I'm getting my face back.",Anonymous
27,Tazorac,Acne,10.0,,"April 13, 2012",36,"My dermatologist prescribed my Tazorac 0.05% cream when no other treatment for my acne worked. To this day I still use it and it clears all my breakouts within days and leaves my skin looking even and radiant. I often spot treat with it too, for it can dry my face out sometimes. Lovely product, I highly recommend.",Anonymous
