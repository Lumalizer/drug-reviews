2,Tazarotene,Acne,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 20, 2022",1,"Let me set the scene: Before Arazlo I had mild to moderate acne mostly around my mouth/chin/sides of my face. I would get painful red cysts and the only thing that seemed to help was Dapsone gel 5%, but my skin care routine set by my dermatologist wasn't preventing my acne as much as desired. After starting Arazlo and SLOWLY incorporating it into my nightly routine (use a pea sized amount for entire face every 3-4 nights and build up to every night), I got the results I had been desperately seeking for almost 3 years. After about 3 months, my acne scars faded, I didn’t get any more of those pesky cysts, and a pimple in general showed up only around my period. If you notice irritation when starting use, apply a gentle moisturizer first, then the Arazlo - that was some of the best advice I have ever received from a YouTube dermatologist. Most importantly, stick with the nightly routine and you will get great results. Be patient folks",Joss
3,Tazarotene,Acne,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 27, 2021",1,"Tazorac (tazarotene):I’m 28 and have dealt with moderate to severe acne since age 16. I’ve done two rounds of Accutane and was put on Tazorac after other retinoids (adapalene, trentinoin) stopped working for me. I was seriously considering a third round of Accutane two and a half months into treatment with Tazorac when I had by far the worst breakout I’ve had since I started using it. Miraculously, I’m now almost at the 3.5 month mark and have barely had any acne in 2-3 weeks, even after stopping the antibiotics I was also taking. If you’re struggling, stick with it at least until the 3 month mark because you might finally get the results you’ve been looking for! Wishing you all the best of luck",GWatson
4,Tazarotene,Acne,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 25, 2021",3,"The product isn't super effective for acne when using it by itself (still the best retinoid though) but when you combine it with the use of Benzoyl Peroxide it works like magic. It makes my skin look great when it comes to texture and it works really well for cystic acne and getting rid of hyperpigmentation, I literally depend on this medication. It's not like other products where you use it for a month and your skin gets used to it and then you stop seeing results, I've been using it for 2 years straight and it ALWAYS works and continues to work. It will make your skin look leathery if you use it for too long but stopping for a a few days is the simple fix, overall I can't ask for a better product because I don't think one exists.",Bpsoldiers

I get compliments all the time and don’t ever wear skin makeup anymore except for my under eyes. My acne wasn’t terrible to begin with, I had just gone off birth control and I had started to get some acne so after I read online about the cystic acne some people experience after getting off BC I decided to go to my dermatologist and get something to help before it got too intense. Seriously can’t recommend this enough, I know everyone’s skin is different but in my opinion it’s definitely worth a try.",SC

Didn't make my skin feel soft like Veltin (Clindamycin / Tretinoin) did. Made my skin rough and bumpy and I had horrible breakouts. I've been using for several months now and it's only getting worse.

I went to my dermatologist for a totally different reason and so while I was there I might as well ask her for any advice on these dark marks I was getting on my forehead and she prescribed me this lotion. After using it for about a week my face got even worse than before. My face was peeling , burning, and flaking like crazy . I developed a rash on my cheeks as well. The dark marks was becoming to appear on my cheeks. I have never had problems with my cheeks it was alway just my forehead. I followed all the directions to this medication. Nonetheless, I completely stopped using it after those side effects. I guess my skin is too sensitive for it.",Jay
9,Tazarotene,Acne,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 12, 2021",1,"I was really excited about trying this since I was wanting something a bit stronger than the tretinoin I had been using, but it quickly backfired. After a few uses I developed skin blisters on both cheeks. I followed all the directions: used every other day, moisturized BEFORE, let the moisturizer dry for an hour before applying the tazarotene, and I only used a very small pea sized amount. I guess this is just not meant for my skin. Back to tretinoin I go after these blisters clear up. Please listen to your skin if you notice something off putting. I didn't at the first sign, and now the blisters are worse after another couple uses. This is great for many people, but also not so great for others.",Jen

I also have perioral dermatitis and was hoping this would help but again, it sheds skin off of my face every day but my skin still looks just as bad as before.

Around when college started, I noticed my acne sprung up a bit. I worried of my acne coming back, so I was prescribe tazarotene. The first few weeks of it are ROUGH. My face would burn, flake, and was red. Added on top, my face purged pretty badly. However, around 6 weeks in, the medicine really kicked in. The purge really cleared up and now my face is almost back to how it was coming off accutane. This cream really doestest your patience, but it is very much worth it.",C

I have been on Accutane twice, relapsed within three months both times, and used every prescription cream under the sun. I have had moderate acne since I was 11. This Tazorac saved me from my acne. I considered quitting so many times, but having pushed through now at 7 months it’s been incredible. The purge was awful and it took sooooo long to see a difference, but at 6 months suddenly I stopped waking up to any acne. I saw slow progressions up until that point.

Apply before bed.Use As little as possible to spread all over affected areas. I used pea size as a rule of thumb but used slightly more as I also had acne and scarring from my cheeks to under my jaw line. Do wait for your skin to fully dry and moisturize after.Follow your dermatologist's instructions. be patient.  I saw very tiny improvements in texture and smoothness every day from starting use but I didn't see anything significant until probably a month and a half in and by 3 to 4 months my skin looks way better.

It makes my face so smooth and I can tell it is preventing me from new pimples.

I was losing hope due to the slow process but I just decided to stay on since it does take longer results for other people. (and I was one of those people). It is now April 2020 and I am just now seeing my acne begin to clear up. It is obviously not where I want my face to be but my skin is looking better.

I used Retin A micro for years and was constantly breaking out then peeling, breaking out then peeling. And it burned when I applied it. I have been using Fabior for the past year and finally found something that works. I got dry after using it for two weeks but not crazy peeling. It only lasted a weekend and wasn’t noticeable to anyone but me. I only use Fabior Monday Wed Friday and I use cerave moisturizer with it which I think helps. If I am breaking out (which is rare now) I may use two days in row but don’t need to often. It’s been life changing for my skin and has helped even out my skin and the leftover color that lingers from breakouts . I refilled for the first time a few months ago, so it lasted me a couple months but maybe because I only use a few times a week. ONLY USE A SMALL AMOUNT~seriously!

I’ve always had trouble with my skin tone being off, but this literally made my face all one tone and look porcelain clear.

She recommended discontinuing it until my skin improved and then only using this once a week until my skin ""acclimated.""Well, kids, the rash went away, but my skin never adjusted to even weekly use. This would make my skin dry, red, stretched and irritated. Consequently, my acne did not improve at all. In fact, I think it may have exacerbated the problem.",George

To this day I still use it and it clears all my breakouts within days and leaves my skin looking even and radiant. I often spot treat with it too, for it can dry my face out sometimes. Lovely product, I highly recommend.",Anonymous
