1,Yaz 28,Acne,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 24, 2022",0,"Yasmin (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):I have been taking Yasmin for years. I primarily use it for my skin but also birth control (I’d use another pill if it was just for birth control due to the risks associated with it). Having tried many pills, this has been the best for my skin which I would say is virtually completely clear, I would have acne otherwise (and I’m in my 30s). I haven’t got pregnant yet either so the birth control element is good. I do get headaches with it, but I do with other pills too, and I can’t say with certainty that if I came off the pill that would stop the headaches. My mood seems fine on it, I haven’t noticed any changes and I don’t suffer from depression. I do get a bit of light spotting in between periods but I have had this investigated and nothing concerning has been found. I may have put a bit of weight on with this pill but nothing dramatic and again it’s hard to say if the pill is responsible (the older you get the more your metabolism slows down). I can’t complain so far.",Olivia

I started noticing I was breaking out a lot more than usual and it really affected my mood. I was also getting irregular periods so of course my doctor recommended that I went on the pill. I’ve been taking the Yasmin pill for exactly a week now and my skin hasn’t been this bad in ages. I’m feeling extremely low all the time and my confidence has been shattered.

I’ve just started the second pack and my skin hasn’t been this clear in well over a year. I regret so much trying to clear my skin naturally when this worked so effectively and quickly. Side effects were breast tenderness which has gone away now and resulted in larger breasts. Headaches, I didn’t used to get headaches but on the pill free week I had them quite bad and needed to take paracetamol. During the pill days I have mild headaches almost daily that don’t last long and don’t require medication but this is a side effect I’m willing to live with as acne DESTROYED my confidence. I also hope this side effect will go away after a few cycles and also if you take it exactly the same time everyday as the headache is caused by oestrogen withdrawal. Haven’t noticed any weight gain. I previously had very light periods but now I have heavier and longer periods. I didn’t break out at all!",Sophia96
8,Yaz 28,Acne,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 8, 2022",0,"Yasmin (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):I used the generic version for birth control and to control my cystic acne, which had started a few months prior at age 21. The first few months using the pill I didn't notice many mood-related side effects, but experienced pretty severe acne. After about 6 months, my skin had cleared up, but I began experiencing a lot of anxiety and became depressed. I also lost weight around this time, but I'm not sure if this was a direct impact of the pill, or a result of the fact that I started working out like crazy to counteract the anxiety I was experiencing. I had started to break out again (cystic acne mainly around my temples and sides of my face), and my mental health (and sex drive!) had just tanked.This persisted until I decided to stop taking the pill after about 10 and a half months of usage;  I stopped taking the pill March 2021 and since then my mood has improved significantly, my sex drive has improved and my skin has also improved with improvements to my diet and skin care routine.",Mlippy
9,Yaz 28,Acne,1.0,,"February 7, 2022",0,"Yaz (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):AVOID this birth control. I know some people have had good experiences with this pill, but it’s not worth the gamble. I began this birth control in hopes it would help regulate my period and help manage some light acne. Within days, my face broke out worse than ever before. I took this pill for almost 3 months hoping it would improve but only worsened. Not only did I get horrible acne; my face and arms bloated, I couldn’t fall asleep at all, my anxiety and depression got so bad I became suicidal. I spend a week in the mental hospital and stopped taking the pill. Within days of stopping my symptoms began to go away. The acne took a long time to clear but no new breakouts happened after stopping the pill. Please don’t risk your mental health and body for this birth control. There are much better options",Bernie

I had always had spotty skin through my twenties but this was next level. My forehead would be super greasy by 9 in the morning too. I started on Yasmin and it took about 3 months to kick in but once it did it was amazing. The pimples stopped and I could go most of the day without having to powder my makeup.

12,Yaz 28,Acne,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 12, 2022",1,"Yaz (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):I've always had bad anxiety about new medications and scared myself quite a bit reading reviews when I first started taking this for PCOS. Luckily the only main symptoms of PCOS I had before were irregular bleeding/spotting and some acne. The first month wasn't horrible but wasn't great, my period lasted almost 2 weeks , I had some breast tenderness and some bad (but manageable cramping). However, after taking it for about 5 months now I can say it has dramatically improved my situation. I was nervous about gaining weight but I am a fit healthy person who works out so I actually ended up losing a few lbs. The best thing is that for the first time in my life I have a regular period, with minimal cramping and lighter flow. The only negatives are that if you don't take it at the same time or skip a pill you will immediately get breakthrough bleeding that can last for quite some time, and also my depression/anxiety has gotten a bit worse although I can't say for sure the Yaz has caused it.",cmppp

14,Yaz 28,Acne,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 6, 2022",0,"Yasmin (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):I would not recommend Yasmin. After being on Sprintec for years and trying Nexplanon. I was put on Yasmin to help with my moderate acne. I started it in Nov 2020. Within maybe 2 months, I saw an improvement in my acne, which was great. Over time, my mental health went absolutely downhill. I found myself crying constantly over everything. I became depressed, VERY anxious, and did not want to spend time with anyone. I would lock myself away in my room in bed. I began doubting all my relationships and questioning everything around me (ie. what was the point of life). It took me months to realize it may be Yasmin. I stopped taking Yasmin at the beginning of June 2021. About two weeks after stopping Yasmin I was feeling a lot more like my old self. If anyone has had their mental health dramatically plummet while taking Yasmin, you are not crazy. Yasmin can absolutely wreak havoc on your emotional well being. Please talk to you doctor about other options. I now have an IUD that I love.",Sammi
15,Yaz 28,Acne,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2022",1,"Yaz (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol):This is my first time writing a review because I OBSESSIVELY read all the reviews for Yaz while going through the ""just starting it time."" Tl;dr, my acne is better than it has ever been in my life. I'm on month five, but pack sixish (I tried skipping my period, didn't work for me). Nothing's ever worked for my cystic acne--I've tried everything except accutane. Yaz was my last resort before going onto the accutane. I was concerned because I was on a different birth control (Maxim) that was apparently also anti-androgen, but it didn't help. I do want to warn you, as many other commenters reported: my acne was THE WORST IT HAS EVER BEEN in the first 3 and a half months or so. Like, so bad I didn't want to leave the house, so bad I woke up before my boyfriend to put on make up and waited to wash my face until after he was asleep (spoiler alert: he couldn't care less. haha. but I did.) I'm left with some scarring and hyperpigmentation that's slowly going away. I'm feeling optimistic :)",Donna

My skin has always been pretty smooth for the most part with maybe some breakouts on my chin or forehead, but since I started Nikki, i've had terrible acne all over my face, sometimes even on my neck. I switched pharmacies and I believe that my new pharmacy doesn't have the generic form of Yaz that my other pharmacy carried, but the generic form of Yaz I was taking before Nikki never made my skin look this awful. I've also been feeling significantly more depressed and anxious recently, and I hadn't contributed that shift in mood to Nikki until I read other people on here saying that Nikki made them feel more depressed and anxious - now I'm suspicious! I've read some people on here say that Nikki didn't start helping their acne until around month three so I'm gonna wait another month or two and come back to update y'all.",Nat L.

I also started getting horrific migraines which had never happened and doesn’t run in my family like migraines usually do. Took me months to track it back to Syeda but it ended up being a side effect that none of my doctors or pharmacists caught. Do not recommend this birth control- the risks far out weigh any good reviews I’ve read and it did nothing to help with my periods either. Avoid at all costs!,Anonymous

I spent so much money on skin care and nothing worked and I was so hopeful for this but I swear it made my acne 10x worse I didn’t want to go out with friends bc I was so embarrassed of my acne and bumps but  I still had hope maybe it get worse before it gets better and one day I was just like u know what I’m gonna stop taking these It’s not improving anything. Not even lying one week later all my acne cleared up once I stopped taking them. I do feel cramps here and there but that’s my hormones going back to normal.

I lost 5lbs which my body was holding onto for years from other BC’s.  But on the last three days of the pack I experienced the most intense intrusive thoughts I’ve ever had in my life.  If I hadn’t been mindfully keeping track of every irregularity I was experiencing, I could have possibly committed suicide.  I do not have any prior mental health issues.  And I’m on day 3 of my new pack and have not had any intense thoughts in these three days.   Be extremely diligent with your birth control and track everything!  Every single thing out of the ordinary and tell someone you love exactly what’s going on so they can help you through finding the right set of hormones that will work for you.   I plan to continue to use YAZ and will continue to track my symptoms with the hopes I don’t experience the psychological issues again.  If I do, I will not be using this BC again.",Scary.

Before it became cystic I had already tried every antibiotic, accutane, tretinoin, aczone, etc. I got facials, light treatments, basically anything to help. When my acne became cystic, I went on Beyaz and was on it for a year and a couple months. After 3 months it cleared me completely- to the point where I was able to drop my skincare routine. I would fall asleep with makeup and wake up and have no new pimples, something I couldn’t even think of before. I stopped because it gave me horrible migraines. After 6 months being off of it I started breaking out again. I am now 23 and have seen a big worsening in the acne that has now made me try yaz. I figured it’s basically the same, so it should work.

I almost did because I wanted to see if the side effects lessened. I could handle the mild fatigue but my anxiety was awful. Very bad physical and mental anxiety. I also felt emotionally blunted. This was sort of amazing at first because I genuinely believe it helped me get over someone I dated. But the anxiety was not worth the emotional regulation. I will say that it’s the only BC that didn’t give me a single pimple upon starting it. So that’s something. I’m sure my skin would be glowing after 3 or 4 months because BC usually makes me break out immediately. Only wish I could tolerate the anxiety!,anonymous

We suspect endometriosis (congenital for me) but aren’t  ready to diagnose. After depo, my skin felt better, still was blemishing only hormonal areas. My period would come and throw my pH out of whack and I’d wind up with BV. This is only my second week on Yaz however I started on the first day of my period as instructed. My hormonal acne areas seem to be clearing (light breakouts in different areas) from hormonal adjusting I think. My breast are growing. I had a light period with no BV.

Even going through a break up around the same time, my acne made a vast improvement from month 3 to month 4. Now just starting my 5th pack, I have near perfect skin except for the VERY occasional little pimple here and there and some acne scarring. I get compliments from so many people as to how much better my skin has gotten, and continues to get! I have even been able to finally stop using Tretinoin (a topical acne treatment) which helped my skin but also made it really sensitive and red.

I started yaz almost a year ago to help with my acne. And yes it cleared my acne 100% and saved my skin. BUT, I do feel like I have some other random side effects? My first month on it I was very depressed which eventually went away. But my periods are still very irregular and I usually never fully bleed? If that makes sense. I mainly just feel like it’s also messed with my pH balance. I was on Blisovi Fe for about 3 years before I switched to Yaz. While I was on blisovi I never really had periods or symptoms but towards the last few months I was on it my acne started to get pretty severe, which is why I switched to Yaz. So yes Yaz saved my skin my I do feel like it’s messed with my overall balance in my hormones.",pancakes33

My gyno put me on the generic Yaz, and I was really worried. I didn’t want to resort to hormones to fix my skin, but I had tried EVERYTHING else. So I started my first pack! My skin just looked HORRID the first month of it. Every morning I would wake up to a new cystic friend on my jawline. Then around month three it all started to clear up. If I felt something brewing, the pimple would kinda disappear on its own (which is so new to me since I always tried to pop them). I am now going into month 5 and I can see true improvement. I only have the occasional cystic pimple (singular!) but I haven’t seen much clear up of some closed comedone pimples between my brows or on my forehead. My boobs are bigger!",Kath

Now 12 weeks later she is still breaking out and it hasn’t stopped.  She is starting accutane tomorrow.  Do not take this product.

I get angry more easily, but the worst were the times when I started crying and I didn’t even had a reason or the reason was very petty, and I just couldn’t stop, even though I knew it’s probably only due to the pill.

For mild side effects, I did get worse headaches during my period and spotting. I have a lowered libido too. But the worst side effect for me is anxiety and depression. I started having panic attacks and bouts of depression only months after starting the pill. I also became very paranoid and jealous in my relationship, which was (likely) unfounded.

I've been on Accutane 3 times and my skin was absolutely perfect after the third time so breaking out once I started taking Yaz was extremely disheartening! I read a BUNCH of comments saying to be patient and wait 3-4 months because that is when you'll notice it starting to regulate to your body and your skin to get better. I just started my third pack AND I AM SO SO HAPPY TO SAY that my skin has gotten SO much better and my period has gotten shorter and lighter!!

My periods are normally extremely heavy, painful, 9 days, and I only have one or two days of moderate flow on Yaz. A major bonus.I did notice over the last five months that I have started to break out on my chin and neck only on the placebo days of the pack but skipping them fixed that issue. I’ve not had issues with mood or libido on Yaz, no spotting, headaches, really no other side effects.I recommend sticking through for a few months.

It was also making me unmotivated (also may have been because of the pandemic and everything going on in the world) but nothing too drastic. Junel was just an ""ehh"" type of pill. Then I switched to Loryna and I notice the first day of taking it, I felt a little sensitive and a little more moody. But the moodiness went away the second day. I saw a lot of reviews about nausea, but I DID NOT experience nausea. I also look A LOT LESS bloated! I also weighed a few pounds less! My skin is nice and clear and I feel good!

I have done everything from dermatologist prescribed topical creams to changing my diet, and revamping my skincare routine. Literally nothing worked. I am now on the start of my 3rd month of Yaz.

I gave it the benefit of the doubt to stick it out to see if my acne would clear up. In my case the acne cleared up on my forehead but moved from my forehead to my cheeks.

The last pill I was on gave me cystic acne, a crazy appetite, and made me irrationally angry all the time. So! To try to get rid of the acne I went on this pill a couple months ago. So far the side effects seem to be bloating, keratosis pilaris breakouts, a lack of energy, and changes in my blood pressure. This pill didn’t give me cysts, but so far there hasn’t been much improvement in my skin. It’s only month two, though, so I’m hoping these side effects and my acne will start to clear up in the next few months. Overall, I like this combination of hormones a lot more than others!

There has been no side effects for me, no mood swings or weight gain which I liked. I initially went on it because I started to experience hormonal acne around my jawline and chin. This has pretty much cleared up now with maybe a couple spots around my pill free week. Apart from that I would highly recommend this pill despite the negative comments I’ve read about it. Definitely give it a go if you experience hormonal acne or you want a pill that doesn’t make you retain weight.",Helen

I’m 38 always been an acne sufferer, had roaccutane at 21, which worked for a while, but after having my children my chin would flare quite severely. I was on Yasmin years ago and decided to try it again, to try and also help my heavy monthly’s to! I’m now into my third packet of pills and I’ve finally started to clear! No new outbreaks and scarring is fading nicely, my periods have been lighter & in myself it’s the best I’ve felt in a long time with PMS symptoms. For anyone struggling with the initial acne outbreak it does get better, it may not seem so right now but it does, I also used a 10% benzoyl peroxide and simple range to wash my face.

Writing this review after a year of struggle with acne that went on for about 10 months.

Then out of the blue I started getting spots on my chest and face, quite badly, they were relentless and beginning to scar.I went to go and see a dermatologist and used antibiotics -lymecycline and tretinoin gel. This helped a lot... I was scared that if I came off them then I would be back to square one. I also had the coil as a contraceptive and had read this may be a contributor to the problem. I got the coil taken out and asked for yasmin. I came off the lymcyline and tretinoin and the acne has not returned! Skin has just got better and better.

I was a little un-easy and nervous to take it because my previous experience with another birth control (Tri Lo Sprintec) was HORRIBLE! I broke out so bad all over one side of my face and chin and experienced the worst mood swings in my life. However with Ocella, it has been smooth sailing. I’m barely starting my third pack and my face has gotten so much better. I did gain about like 5 pounds since being on this BC however that could definitely be from lifestyle change. I would suggest a healthy diet/exercise as a good solution. I realized the pounds aren’t hard to lose if you eat right and  run.

As soon as I went on yaz I felt a major change in my mood and energy levels. I was underweight due to the depression and I gained 5lbs. My breast size also increased (from a 32B to 32DD). I just felt so much better and balanced. I haven’t had any  negative side effects  unless weight gain is negative for you. Highly recommend to get your hormones tested before going on this pill. I don’t think you should take it if your estrogen levels are already high. Good luck!",Kay

After first month of use, acne has significantly improved, is now reduced to a few hormonal pimples on cheek/chin near menstruation. In second month- decrease in excessive oil and significant improvement in skin integrity(heals faster, reduced inflammation, skin feels and looks healthier ‘thicker’). Menstruation is lighter however, have some light spotting mid cycle, and suspect my body is still adjusting to medication after only 2 months. Mood generally more even and cool, fewer extreme lows.Side effects! I work 12h days and also run long distance and I’ve noticed a drop in my stamina.

It took about three months to see any noticeable change but after that it was extremely clear and I felt amazing! However I had to go off it a few months later as I’d been getting frequent headaches and thought the pill was the cause. Then of course the dreaded pimples came back and slowly but surely about three months after they were worse than before I went on it. So I decided to go back on Yaz as I knew it had worked for me in the past. Now I’ve been on it for almost two months and my skin is the absolute worst it has ever been with bright red cystic acne all over my cheeks (I didn’t even have it there before). Although it upsets me a great deal as it does everyone else I am remaining hopeful because it has worked wonders in the past and I think my body is just taking its time to adjust to change!

I tried Sprintec prior to this and it did nothing for my acne. Short term, I have had no side effects from Loryna. No weight gain, no extreme mood swings, nothing. My only complaint and reason for considering switching is that after taking this long term, I recently developed spider veins on my thighs. I have NEVER had such a thing so it was very concerning as I am only 25 and in very good health, and as I know there are increased risks for DVT while taking this drug. Recently the areas on my thigh where the spider veins developed have become somewhat painful at work (as I stand all day). I attribute the development of the spider veins directly to Loryna as this is only medication I have taken the past couple years. It is such a shame because I absolutely love what it has done for my skin (flawless even during the time around my period), but the veins cause a large concern for me so I am heavily considering switching.

I was always self-conscious about my acne. It even got to the point where I would carry a small mirror everywhere and I would just look at myself to make sure I didn't get another pimple. Both my mom and my doctor told me to go on the pill (also my period was so irregular i once got it for a whole month and then I wouldn't have it for months) but I was so scared because I thought I was going to break out so badly at the beginning. My mom got so worried about me having my period for so long that she forced me to take it. It was the best decision of my life.

I noticed a significant difference in my skin within the first month and now my skin is completely clear with the exception of the occasional bump or two around my period. I get the typical mood swings around my period but nothing too crazy. I have noticed I feel a little more anxious since I've started taking it but it isn't extreme. My boobs are much more full now, which I like, but I have gained a little weight (about 3-5 pounds)  which has proven hard to get rid of it.",SlpKB

Now it is May and I finally have clear skin. I still have a few red marks from scars and I get tiny little pimples but no where near what I had before. This stuff is amazing and I finally feel confident again. It started to really work for me on month 4 so give it time and don't give up.,Michelle Kolodka

I have lots of clogged pores, very oily skin, and would get big zits on my chin that were not only ugly but painful. Yaz helped with the painful chin acne but not completely. It also helped my oiliness go down but not enough. I am on Accutane now and cannot wait to stop taking Yaz. My period is still heavy, I think it helped with PMS. I spot on this a lot. I also skipped the white pills this month in order to not have my period and have had my period for an entire MONTH. Obviously my body didn't respond to that well! I had an increase in appetite, gained twelve pounds. Also I am tired ALL THE TIME and feel moody.",ksfsjkfhasds

I was prescribed Yaz after none of the topical medications worked, for example, Tazorac, in both the gel and cream form. It does take a while to see the full effect. I noticed after 2 months the shine that I always had on my face went away, and slowly, over a course of about 9 months my skin was completely clear. It was a miracle, to say the least. My dermatologist kept me on the Tazorac just as a caution, but I know it was the Yaz that truly cleared my skin up. I highly recommend Yaz as long as you are in good health to use it (don't smoke or anything) and want to see a real change in your skin.",Anonymous

It was everywhere and I scar really bad if I pick my pimples or not. I was at the end of my rope. I was so tired of having to wear make-up in the mornings when I don't really like to wear it at all. Now, just in 3 weeks time, my acne has dried up completely. All I can do is thank the makers of this product. I woke up this morning and there was only 2 small pimples on my face. I was truly amazed because I had struggled with acne for the past 3 years. The only side effect for me is upset stomach, but that's nothing compared to the nightmare I was living.

I wanted to go on Yaz for a number of reasons: First and foremost being hormonal acne.  I am into the second pill pack and I have noticed favorable results. This is certainly not a miracle cure, but I have started to notice fewer hormonal breakouts, and my skin is more even and healthy looking. I also attribute this to variations in diet and exercise, which I think is essential to all good skin care. As most of the reviews say, just stick with it. The only negative side effect I've noticed thus far, is fatigue, but that is starting to diminish. Good luck!",Anonymous

However, don't be discouraged because it does take a couple weeks to months for your body to adjust to the hormones and essentially your skin may worsen. I was on the pill for about a year and literally never had to worry about a breakout. I got off for about 8 months and just started back on it a week ago because my skin started to get really bad again. My face is the worst I've ever seen it right now but I know sticking with it will be worth it.

So I tried it and for the first couple of months I noticed my acne getting even worse! I guess it was just my body getting used to the hormones.  It took some time but starting at about 6 months, I saw a huge difference in my acne. I almost never get a pimple now!
