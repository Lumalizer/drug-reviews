0,Tetracycline,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 16, 2021",0,I tried many things for the acne on my cheeks and a bit on my forehead. Nothing ever worked. I even tried retinA. My derm suggested that I go on Roaccutane but due to person reasons I decided not to and opted for tetracycline instead. It worked wonders on my skin. I've never been so happy and confident in my own skin. It cleared up my face completely.,Tali

2,Tetracycline,Acne,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 19, 2021",0,Please don't use this. It will work as a miracle for first few months and then nothing.People are stuck with this medicine because their dermatologist recommends this.

3,Tetracycline,Acne,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 6, 2021",1,"I've taken this for about 15 - 20 years. It was prescribed for a painful skin condition that is mainly contained on the back of my head, not sure what it's called. Anyway, I've never had any issues with the tablets, I still get mild acne, but it's not particularly painful. Recently I've decided to give it a break to see how it goes, so far, bit of blurred vision and my skin seems OK.....which is fine. My aim isn't trying to rid myself of things I need to take, it's just dealing with legacy medications I no longer need.We all have medications we don't react well to. For me it's beta blockers and stomach acid reducers. It's not the medications fault, it's just my body. For example, I take Famotidine for GERD, and it's two weeks of absolute nightmare when I start.....proper pain and nausea, constantly debating ringing an ambulance......but after the 2 weeks it's alright. It's better than being really ill for 8 weeks when for the sake of 2 weeks pain you get 6 weeks basically alright",Big Dave
4,Tetracycline,Acne,10.0,,"August 2, 2021",0,"I was prescribed this in Dec 2020 and was given a 3 month prescription. In this time it cleared my subclinical acne but I started getting closed comedones which would become pustules and leave scarring which I had never experiences before. After this I stopped the medication for about a week but the subclinical acne started appearing again so I went back on it. This was around March and I then asked for a repeat prescription and have stayed on the medication since then. Around April my skin stopped producing closed comedones/pustules and it has been clear ever since. I have not stopped the medication- I tried to stop it for 2 weeks to see how my skin would react and I started getting clogged pores and oily (it reverted to a form of mildish acne, manageable but definitely not as clear as it was whilst I was on the medication). Along with this medication I use Epiduo and a simple skincare routine during the day.",Amy

6,Tetracycline,Acne,10.0,,"March 31, 2021",15,"I've been on oxytetracycline for a year now and I remembered looking at reviews for it the day I got it prescribed. I thought I should share my own experience as I can see that they vary greatly. For me, oxytetracycline has worked wonders. My skin was pretty bad, I had big cystic spots under the skin on my face which were painful and hard to get rid of and each time I got rid of one, another one would appear. Once I started taking oxytetracycline, I had no new spots appearing on my face and after 2 weeks, any remaining spots had pretty much disappeared. Since then I haven't stopped taking it and my skin has been completely clear. I would 100% recommend trying it.",Khloe

12,Tetracycline,Acne,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 1, 2021",3,"I’m in the uk so my prescriptions have been either free or £9. I’ve tried tetracycline for acne 3 times now, including my current cycle. I’ve had 3 months of lymecycline tablets each time. I’d say the results have also been the same each time. The acne gets slightly worse for the first month before becoming very minimal in the second. I tend to find that after finishing a course my acne is greatly reduced for a good 6-9 months after before creeping up in intensity again. I am currently a young adult and have had a course in my teens. My type of acne is widespread, face, shoulders, back and chest, but with small pustules & never was cystic. I also have combination skin naturally. One particular side effect for me is heavy dryness/flakiness on my face, hands and lower legs, but it’s manageable by moisturising and goes away after the course is complete.",Tyriusa

15,Tetracycline,Acne,8.0,,"October 14, 2020",25,"I've suffered from acne since I was around 12 years old, where it started off on my forehead and progressively moved around my face, on my cheek areas in particular. By the time I hit the age of 18 my forehead was completely clear, but the cheek areas still had bad acne. The acne began to clear as I hit 21, with just major scarring there (not toothpick scars, just surface ones- blemishes). A few months ago, the acne returned to the cheek areas, and it was the worst it had ever been. I had a consult with my doctor who onto say that I had severe acne (my acne had never been classed as this before). She prescribed me with Tetracycline (as well as a topical cream). Within 2 weeks of the antibiotic treatment, my skin was even worse than before, and I came up in big spots. However, I'm now 5 weeks into the treatment, and the acne is almost gone- I still have a couple of spots here and there, but it's nothing like before.
