3,Doxycycline,Acne,,,"November 6, 2021",0,I took this but a lower dosage before and it helped clear my skin fast I didn't purge at all.

5,Doxycycline,Acne,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 4, 2021",0,"I took doxycycline for my cystic acne along with taro bp/ clindamycin. I have finished the pills and now on taro bp/clindamycin for now. I took doxycycline for about 6 weeks (40 days) and it did help with improving my condition. The first two weeks I was dealing with painful acne and redness which can be due to the purge of starting it. After that my skin cleared up pretty nicely - still have scarring but it’s gotten better. With the drug, If your immune system is compromised don’t take it - it can cause problems! Eat it with food for better digestion. Make sure to drink plenty of fluids with it - I drank a full glass of water and kept drinking water through out the day. Keep in mind with antibiotics, your acne CAN come back - you need a long term prescription to help prevent it from coming.  Take care of your gut and if your acne is really bothering you, this is an effective drug to clear it up temporarily.",AK22

7,Doxycycline,Acne,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 10, 2021",0,"I have had acne for a long time. Dealing with acne from a young age - middle school to high school was tough. When I got out of high school and approached my late teens/the early 20s, it got better and I really had little to no acne which was very controllable. Fast forward the pandemic happened and my acne came back slowly, getting worse over time. Towards the end of 2020 and the present, I have been dealing with cystic acne which was a big blow to me. I have been prescribed doxycycline for almost 6 weeks (40 days) and taro bp/clindamycin along with it. I have taken the drug for about 2 weeks now and I see an improvement. I have been getting new cysts that fade quickly which I believed I am currently purging and the topical clindamycin/bp helps with some inflammation. I suggest taking it with food for better digestion as the antibiotic can make you feel sick and nauseous. I'll update at the end of my course for a final verdict. :)",AK22

9,Doxycycline,Acne,10.0,,"May 17, 2021",38,"I had horrible mixed acne. I had cystic acne all along my jaw line and then white heads in the hollows of my cheeks. It was AWFUL! My acne was awful and was caused by the IUD I had. After removing the IUD the acne didn’t go away. Keep in mind I’m nearly 30 and never really had acne before this. I was put on 100mg Doxy with a topical Bianca treatment 2-3 times a week cleared my skin up completely. The Bianca is still working away at the scarring but it has improved my skin tone and scarring by about 80%. Cerave face wash morning and night with a light mosturizer after, as well as the Bianca 2-3 times a week is my skin routine and it’s perfect for me. I highly recommend Cerave. It really helps restore the skin barrier. Damaged skin barrier = acne for sure! Luckily I had zero side effects.

When I was younger, I didn't take it so seriously as now because I was getting tired of being insecure about it. First of all, I got prescribed another antibiotics which kinda worked, then I wanted to try the contraceptive pills which really didn't suit me and I quit in 1 month. And now I finished one month of this one and it is amazing. I never ever had such beautiful skin, I am thankful that I can be confident again. I am using Epiduo gel too. This is medication is really great and it might take time for it to work. And about the nausea- it can be really bad.. So make sure you eat well before you take it, otherwise it is quite bad..

12,Doxycycline,Acne,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 15, 2021",11,It has made no difference in my cystic acne as it made me break out. Then I thought it would get better because it made it worse then it didn’t get better so I came off of it and it went back to the way it was. It was still a little worse than it was before. The NHS keep refusing to put me on Accutane even though I’ve tried 5 repeated acne treatments. The reason I feel like they won’t give me Accutane is because it’s to expensive and costs for the NHS to much even though the 5 repeated acne medications probably cost more in the first place.,Parks

I haven't really gotten any new acne except a few small pimples that are nothing compared to what I have been getting. I am also using adapalene gel in the morning and tretinoin at night. I will say personally I MUST take the doxy with food - when I dont, it makes me severely nauseous even to the point where I throw up. The nausea would normally subside in ~45 minutes.

I thought I could cure my acne by just trying new creams, washes, scrubs but finally gave up and went to the doctor. She recommended doxycyline (3 months) and adapalene gel after telling me it looked like severe acne. I was a bit hesitant to take medication as I was afraid it'd come back. She told me the only the option was to see a dermatologist which was about $200-$300. I finally decided to take the meds and use the gel and honestly that was the best decision ever! I started to see a difference on the first day. 2 months in and I feel so confident with my skin. She said if I wanted to repeat it I could. But I'll try and attempt to get off it after my 3rd month.

At the end of the 1st week my acne looked as if it dried up (meaning there wasn’t any pimples only acne scars). If you never use to wear sunscreen well you would need to especially during the first months, your skin is soooo sensitive. Waxing is a no no and exfoliating is a big no (learned the hard way lol). It also causes nausea, it is very important to take it whilst eating or right after a meal to not get nausea. The scaring eventually go away in 2 months or so after use (my experience), for quicker results my Dr. prescribed a skin lightening cream for spot treatment. After 6 months I was off Doxycycline and I just use Retin A and Deriva C alternatively.

I’ve heard it can take 12 weeks to actually see a difference, so I’m going to continue with doxy but I do not believe it has helped much thus far.

I have now complete taking this medicine along with topical creams & I have NOT seen absolute improvement. The inflammation is worse than when I started. As for the side effects, I experienced the typical effects of an antibiotic(nausea, stomach pain..) though extreme tiredness up to 2hours after taking it and that's why I decided to take them at night after dinner. I rate them with a 2 since although it did not prevent me from getting more acne, it caused the acne to remain concentrated only in the cheeks & chin.

56,Doxycycline,Acne,9.0,,"December 23, 2019",49,"About 8 months ago, my skin suddenly went from clear to having huge, painful hormonal breakouts. My doctor recommended doxycycline so I started taking it. It took around 2 (very frustrating) months to start seeing a difference, but ever since then my skin has cleared up. I still occasionally get breakouts, but from things other than hormones (diet, not washing face, etc.). Reading through these reviews, this doesn’t work for everyone, but I recommend at least trying it, especially if you are dealing with hormonal, cystic acne. Things I’ve learned:-don’t take it before lying down-don’t take it on an empty stomach-take it with a large glass of water and eat afterwards-from extensive internet research, it seems like doxycycline normally takes 8-10 weeks before you start seeing a difference and 12 before the full effects-works best when combined with differin gel (available at a drug store without a prescription), moisturizer and a gentle cleanser",scass

I've been on doxycycline multiple times (sometimes my derm suggests I start it up again if my skin flares up after a 2 year break) and it's a tried-and-true drug that always works for me. It makes my skin clear, perfect, smooth, and glowing! No complaints! It has no hormones so it most likely will work for anyone.

I started to give up on clearing my face.. After a while I stopped buying face scrubs and other face cleansers etc and I would buy acne cream which would make my pimples less irritated but didn't get rid of them also they would leave my skin with dry patches which would look very bad once makeup is applied. After a while my doctor prescribed me doxycycline at the start it made my face get worse but a few weeks in my face started to clear up and a few months in my face was bump free..

Doxy is a quick fix and as long as you're on it, it will work. However, coming off the meds you're skin will start to purge so be prepared. I've been mixing the right vitamins, cutting out dairy, eating GF, and keeping my diet rich in lots of green leafy veggies and high protein. I also have to exercise at least 3 times a week.

I read all the reviews so I was afraid of ""it gets worst before it gets better"" thankfully that wasn't the case for me. Honestly, this medicine has been amazing. I've followed it to the tee. No food 2 hrs before or 2 hrs after because it works best on an empty stomach. I've been lucky that I haven't had any side effects. It's been great at preventing breakouts so overall I'm super happy with this medication.",Lorenita728

It worked within 3 days and started drying out my acne, but after 2 weeks I stopped because it was irritating my stomach to much. My face was pretty cleared up but not perfect.
