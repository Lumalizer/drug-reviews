0,Spironolactone,Acne,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 30, 2022",0,"This medication has helped me drastically. I’ve never experienced acne up until the COVID-19 pandemic. I also have eczema. I was reluctant at first to try this given that I didn’t want to dry my skin out even more than it is, but I’m glad I did! My dermatologist started me on 50 mg, but there was no noted difference. He upped me to 100 mg and I started to see a difference after two months. The difference was not drastic and began to plateau so he upped me to 150 mg and my face is practically clear! My acne is less angry, red and bumpy. I do experience some side effects such as headaches and increased thirst (some days I feel like I have cotton mouth) but it’s worth it to me. It’s helped my self confidence significantly. I am grateful.",Lauren

I bought lots of expensive acne cremes, that only dried my skin along with break-outs. Decided to go visit a dermatologist! She prescribed Spironolactone 100mg. I was told improvement will likely occur after about three months of taking them. Well, after about six months of taking them, my skin and body cleared. If you are just starting to take it and not seeing any results, KEEP using it!!! It works!! You are beautiful!!",Chocolate God

I initially denied but after seeing positive reviews agreed to give it a try. Thank Goodness I was started at the lowest dosage (25mg?)

8,Spironolactone,Acne,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 4, 2022",0,"So I started using this medication due to hormonal acne post BC, I have tried to cure it naturally with supplements, healthy meals, professional peels but nothing worked. After long debating and my acne worsening my Derm convinced me to go on medication, I decided to take the spirolactone instead of accutane. Have been on this medication since December 1 st started with 50 mg a day which was good my face was clearing up, then I was told to increase to 100 mg a day after 2 weeks, symptoms were more noticeable I felt tired all day. After 2 months of still no noticeable improvement I was directed to increase to 150 mg which made me feel even more tired, taking it at night helped a little at this point but then I realized at month 2 I started my period earlier than usual turns out I’ve been spotting for a month now my acne has drastically worsened like never before. I have lost hopes and will be going on BC again and accutane. Everyone’s body is diff but this is was my experience.",Anonymous

I know everyone has their own unique experiences and side affects, and in the beginning of taking it, I sincerely believed it was causing massive amounts of my hair to fall out… because my hair WAS falling out. I continued to take it everyday despite serious anxiety and fear that all of my hair was going to fall out.I’m so glad I kept taking it!! After the first 2 months, I noticed my hair fall out drastically decrease. I was barely losing hair when brushing and washing it. I noticed new hair growth after about 3-4 months, and I continue to see new hair growth on the crown of my head. I can go a couple of days without washing my hair, and it doesn’t get oily like it used to. My hair feels and looks much healthier and fuller.My acne has cleared up dramatically, I barely wear any make up now. I feel so much better inside and out.",Sandra

12,Spironolactone,Acne,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 23, 2022",0,"I started Spironolactone at 23 years old when my hormonal acne was bad and I had painful periods. Spironolactone helps with both hormonal acne and blocking the androgen (testosterone) hormones which is what I had an abundance of. Spironolactone worked amazing. Within the first three weeks all my acne was gone AND my periods became normal. It took me a bit to figure out what dosage to take but found my ideal intake was 75 mg for 20 days and 100 mg for 10 days (100 mg dose leading up to my period and the week of my period). Everything was great for a year but the last two months my period has been very painful again. I have been throwing up and my acne is starting to show a little bit. I am not concluding that my body is ""used"" to taking Spironolactone and that I am now unaffected by it. I have been eating a lot of salt and realize that works against the medication, and made me bloated! I am trying whole 30 diet and reducing sodium intake, and will give an update on how that affects my body.",Hannah

I haven't noticed any negative side effects, but my acne has almost completely cleared up! I still get an occasional spot here and there from my mask or sweating at the gym or something, but they're no longer cystic, painful, or everywhere. I rarely have more than 1 pimple at any 1 time. I use it in conjunction with Tretinoin, and my skin has been so glowy and smooth ever since!! If you're struggling with acne, please give this a chance!! I was seriously in the worst head space before starting, and now I am so much happier. It took about 2-3 months to completely clear up my skin, so be patient! I promise it's worth it.",abbyjmorton
14,Spironolactone,Acne,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 18, 2021",12,"I started getting hormonal acne my freshman year of college. Like many others have mentioned in the reviews, I tried just about everything to clear it up. By everything I mean I completely changed my lifestyle. Started exercising, cut out fast food, went dairy free, sugar free, gluten free, took doxycycline, got on birth control, and I was still getting these big cysts on my face that would scar. It completely destroyed my confidence, at times I didn’t even want to leave the house because I was so embarrassed. Went to a new doctor and they put me on 50mg of spironolactone. First 2 months my acne got worse. But by the 3rd month my skin was completely clear. I’ve been on it for a year next month, and I haven’t had a single cystic pimple since the 3rd month. It’s also helped my hair so much. I’ve had no side effects by size and an increase in boob size. For anyone that has hormonal acne I understand how you feel and know how distressing it is",Melissa
15,Spironolactone,Acne,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 9, 2021",0,"I originally took this a few years ago for hormonal acne and at the same time my hair started thinning, but I was also slightly more stressed at the time so I just chalked it up to that. I ended up stopping the drug because it was making me dizzy and light headed and there was definitely some weight gain. This past August (2021) I decided to go back on it because my acne had gotten worse… I now know the cause of my hair loss/thinning. THIS DRUG. My hair had been at the healthiest and fullest it’s EVER been before restarting it. my hair was already thinning on the drug so that’s when I spoke to my Dr about switching to something else. once I stopped, my hair started falling out by the handfuls. Until one day I was showering and it was coming out in Clumps. I’m absolutely devastated. It doesn’t help that every Dr swears this drug doesn’t ever cause hair loss, when clearly IT DOES.",Bald and sad
16,Spironolactone,Acne,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 26, 2021",0,"Ladies PLEASE BEWARE. This drug has WRECKED my life for the time being. I started taking it for acne after coming off birth control. It cleared my skin immediately with no noticeable side affects, my boobs even got bigger, I was seriously living my best life. I thought I found a miracle drug. It wasn't until I hit the 5 month mark that I noticed my hair becoming INCREDIBLY brittle. Like breaking off my scalp brittle, looking like I got electrocuted brittle! I absolutely panicked, KNEW it was from this medication as nothing else in my life had changed and slowly started tapering down my dosage. However the dread shed is REAL. I am completely devastated. I used to have insanely thick beautiful hair that would get complimented every where I would go. My hair is so thin now. Every time I look on the mirror I feel sick. It’s taking a toll on my relationship. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS FOR ACNE. There are other alternatives!!",Alexis
17,Spironolactone,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 24, 2021",0,This has been a miracle drug for me. I am 53 and can’t remember not having deep cystic acne. I switched dermatologists. She had given me many products and meds over the years but never mentioned Spirolactone. The new doc took one look at me and said she had a cure and prescribed 100mg of Spirolactone. I could tell the first day it was a miracle: I woke up and my face was not greasy for the first time ever. She wanted me to take it at night but it made me pee so much I switched to taking it in the morning. Even that side affect wore off after about three weeks. It’s been 3 months and not a single break out. My skin isn’t greasy. I can suddenly go two days in a row without washing my hair. It’s as if a switch went off in my body and everything starting working correctly. If I had found this 40yrs ago my whole life would have been different: no more pain and embarrassment.,Teresa
18,Spironolactone,Acne,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 23, 2021",0,"I'm a 31 year old female who took this for acne, but ended up quitting because of the HORRIBLE mood swings I got. Also, the combination with my anti-depressant (Wellbutrin) made me incredibly loopy, spaced out, and dizzy. I'm super glad for this forum because my doctor seemed to think that my symptom of being incredibly agitated and irritated had *no* relationship to the spironolactone. However, on days when I wasn't taking it, I didn't have the same issue. In conclusion, it SORT of helped with my acne but my acne got much worse once I stopped taking it. Plus, once I stopped eating gluten, my acne completely stopped, so I think that was more the issue than a hormone imbalance.",Patient
19,Spironolactone,Acne,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 1, 2021",1,"I thought spironolactone was going to be my savior for acne. And I was right to an extent, I started this drug because my acne gave me a horrible self image and I have tried so many different topicals, programs, and medication‘s. Spiro completely cleared my skin in a couple of months but I started having horrible side effects. I would be very disoriented, dizzy, and had a really intense brain fog. I couldn’t get through a day of work without all of my coworkers being concerned thinking that I was going to pass out or fall over. I highly recommend anybody struggling with acne to stay away from this drug because the horrible side effects were enough to make me realize that my health is more important, and just a couple months after stopping spironolactone my acne has come back in full swing, ruining my self-confidence once again. Spiro is not a permanent fix for your acne, so I highly suggest finding another medication or program to use.",User7

My hair is so thin since I started taking spironolactone. I am on 50mgs a day. I started it because I have hormonal cystic acne of course my skin is clear from it but I have to stop the medication because it's caused so much hair fall. My dermatologist says that's not possible but if you look up the side effects of spironolactone it says hair loss and hair thinning can be a side effect,I lost my hair

After suffering a catastrophic cystic acne outbreak during Accutane that left me with disfiguring facial scars, I was miserable and hopeless. My derm recommended I discontinue the Accutane as it was making my acne worse after 8 months of use and put me on 75 mg of Spiro. Best decision ever! My face is finally clear. I should have never gone on Accutane. Only con is that if I drink before bed I will 100% wake up in the middle of the night having to pee. And in the morning I will always have to pee.",Kira

Skin felt a bit dried and I feel dizzy at times.   Second week, minor eye twitch, dryer skin, dizziness.   Third week, persistent eye twitch, heart palpitations, feeling anxiety building up + the eye twitching = insomnia.   The eye twitching was coupled with severe dry eyes.  (Do note that my background have dry eyes due to two rounds of Accutane I took 11 years ago).   Face was dry, so no acne, but the side affects were too much to bear for me.  Went on a lower dosage to 25 mg per day, no effect, went back up to 50 mg a few days before my period was coming because I had 2 cysts on my chin and the same side effects came back.  The eye twitching and dry eyes was the most unbearable part.   So, going totally off this drug.    It's definitely not for me.

The first 3 months of taking this, my skin went through an awful ""purge."" I spent most of my summer hiding out because I was so embarrassed by my skin. Huge cystic bumps, especially on my chin! It was really painful & hard to deal with, but after 3 months it finally started clearing up. Now about 4 months in & my skin looks so beautiful! If you are taking this, please HANG IN THERE.

Previously my doctor successfully treated my hormonal acne with a combination birth control, but I switched to the Kyleena IUD, which caused some of that acne to come back, as the IUD isn’t as good at treating hormonal acne. After getting my acne under control with Minocycline (an antibiotic, weird I know), I’ve been on Spironolactone for about 2-3 weeks now and I love it, BUT I’m having terrible (what feel like) period cramps while taking the Spironolactone. I did an experimental 3 days off of it and the cramping resolved, but now after resuming treatment with it, the cramps have returned. I don’t know what to do because it works great for my acne and I very much care about my appearance.",Em.

28,Spironolactone,Acne,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 11, 2021",1,"I cannot recommend Spironolactone enough!!! I have struggled with every form of acne since I was 16. I am now almost 30, having the same issues, but now living my life again thanks to this miracle drug. I have spent hundreds of dollars looking for a fix for my hormonal acne and dull skin. My family doctor started me off of 25 mg, then 50 mg and then my dermatologist bumped me up to 100 mg. I still get the occasional pimple but not the painful cystic acne anymore. It takes about 2 months to kick in and the only side effect I’ve had is urinating more than usual. But hey, it’s a diuretic and constantly helping my body flush itself. A little piece of advice is to take your dosage around 6 pm so that you flush your system before you go to sleep, and you’re not waking up to go to the bathroom. Give it a chance! I promise you won’t regret it!",AMAZING
29,Spironolactone,Acne,1.0,,"August 9, 2021",0,"Spiro for over 6 months and I really regret it. I had mild acne beforehand. I’m 33 and 49kg. 50mg did nothing then upped to 75mg and my skin exploded. It’s not a ‘purge’, it doesn’t get out spots that would have come anyway, it creates new ones by affecting your hormones. It was HORRENDOUS. I struggled to sleep without icing my face. Increased the dose to 100mg, it got worse. Six months in, derm told me to stop because it wasn’t working.  People have strong opinions on Spiro, keep telling you to wait. I get that if skin isn’t doing anything, however I struggle to articulate just how bad mine was for half a year. Sadly, skin has not yet returned to how it was before the Spiro. I spent a lot of time and money to make my skin FAR WORSE. If I could go back in time I would never ever touch the drug. But honestly you’ll know what’s right and working for your own body.

It definitely makes your skin worse before it gets better and is very effective with treating hormonal acne. However, something I didn’t really consider was the spotting. I have taken birth control pills for years and when taking spironolactone I experienced spotting heavier than my periods. I changed my birth control pill multiple times giving each 6 months at least to see if they would help. Even going so far as to get ultrasounds to make sure it wasn’t anything else. I would go a couple weeks with no spotting and a couple weeks with spotting non stop the entire time on this medication. Eventually I could not stand it anymore and stopped taking it.

This caused my acne to return and almost a year later I decided to try it again, this time my dermatologist increased my dose to 100mg per day. At first I had no side effects, until about a month in I started getting breast tenderness, irregular periods, hair loss, and rapid weight gain. Again my acne was nearly gone and my skin improved significantly, but I decided to stop taking it again. The side effects were not worth it. I have decided to opt for a healthier lifestyle instead and hope that controls my acne a bit more. I would recommend to take Spiro with precaution.

I took every supplement, and spent thousands on face products to find that right mix that would ""fix"" my skin.  Finely in Feb of 2021 I went to the derm.

I tried everything I could think of to get it to go away: 3 birth controls, changing my diet, antibiotics, multiple dermatologists, every skincare item there is, and multiple topical treatments and I still had cystic acne. Finally, I asked my derm to put me on spironolactone and she agreed. I saw results almost immediately! I did purge for the first 3 weeks only but only with 2-4 more pimples than usual. After the first month my skin was completely clear and I haven’t had a single cystic pimple in 4 months ( my dermatologist did say it can take 6 months for some people though so be patient if you don’t see results this quickly). I also experienced no side effects with this. Highly recommended for hormonal acne as I know how much cystic acne can affect your self esteem. If you have acne hang in there it gets better and I hope you see results with this!",Sels
42,Spironolactone,Acne,9.0,,"April 12, 2021",3,"I'm 22 & have had cystic acne on my chin for the past 10 years. My derm finally started me on Spironolactone 50mg twice a day. Before this pill I would have 2-6 inflamed white heads on my chin & 1-2 cysts under the skin at all times. I started Spironolactone in Nov 2020. During the first 2 months I had a purging phase but at the 2 month mark my skin had started to clear up significantly. From then on, I have had very little breakouts, maybe 3-4 white heads in a months period (which I partly blamed on wearing a mask), & no cysts. March 2021 I asked my derm if I could bump up my dose to see if I could achieve 100% clear skin. After a month of 100mg in the morning and 50mg  at bedtime, my skin is the clearest it has ever been. I still get the occasional tiny white head from my mask. I personally never noticed any negative side effects. This is also not a fast solution to acne, it can take months to get to clear skin. For me, it has taken approx 6 months to get to this point.",Anonymous

It gradually got better, but do not take this drug unless you are prepared to wait 6 months to see results which was very hard mentally on me. I often read the comments on this website to give me hope that it would finally start working so I wanted to share my experience as well. To be clear though, I am not completely free of acne, but there is a substantial reduction to what I was seeing before. I was on accutane twice and after 2 years of being off of it and increased stress my sophomore year of college I started to get cystic acne again. Spironolactone does not work as well as accutane but I think that it is a really good option for anyone who took accutane and the results didn't last because you can take Spiro for as long as you want.",Anonymous

Not only has my cystic acne disappeared but my hair started growing! I have had gradual hair thinning since I was 12. I am now 26 and my hair has substantially thinned out over the years. I have tired other hormone medications to stop the thinning, such as Finasteride. But no other medication has stopped the thinning AND increased hair growth. It’s important to point out that I didn’t notice increased hair growth until recently (about 9 months after I first started taking it), this medication definitely takes time but it’s so worth it.",Sam

After reading up on it I realized it’s actually a blood pressure medication. I checked my blood pressure and realized the medication was causing it to drop super low which is why I was feeling so fatigued, light headed, etc. I was actually embarrassed I didn’t read up on it prior but my derm  never mentioned it only really saying it could make me pee a lot. I then halved my dose and my blood pressure went back into a normal range and removed the fatigued/light headed ness. However, on 50 mg  I was still feeling nauseous during the day so I moved to taking it before I go to bed and found it actually seems to help me fall asleep and only causes me to get up once in the night to pee.

Then started having bad breakouts again for over 6 months. I finally found out the reason I started breaking out again. I read online on spironolactone site under the drug and food interactions that table salt in large amounts of all things can decrease the medications effectiveness. Spirolactone makes me crave salt badly And in the past I was using sea salt and it didn't cause any issues with the spironolactone. I started using table salt again and that is why my face went nuts. When I switched back to using sea salt my bad acne went away and I now have clear skin again.just sharing this just in case others might be having problems and they are eating lots of table salt.,Cassara

Nothing was working and it was getting worse. I never thought I would have it this bad. I went to the dermatology and wish I did sooner. They recommended Spiro and after the first month I could already see a difference. They also gave a cream that helped heal as well. After three months on the pill all my acne almost cleared up. Now 6 months later I barely get any. I would read all of these reviews all the time just so I would have some faith it would work and it really did.

I only had big bumps around my mouth/chin, around my hair line, and my temples. It was nothing severe but definitely noticeable.

Its like birth control 2.0 (although it does not prevent pregnancy of course). I highly recommend it to those struggling with hormonal acne, just increase the dose slowly. Spironolactone is a diuretic and your body really needs time to get used to it. You also really have to watch your potassium. Some derms may tell you to increase your spironolactone dose quickly or they may tell you to start out on 50mgs twice daily- but trust me this is not a good idea.

One year on my skin is AMAZING.  I don't get cysts and spots any more. I have gained so much confidence and spend so little time thinking about my skin.

Severe anxiety, panic attacks, tremors, short of breath, stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, depression, irregular heart beat, arm numbness, chest pain, all day every day. Ears ringing, sleep problems. Lost 25 lbs. Horrible. No drs had any advice, answers, or wanted to help. Ever since then the symptoms remain, but SLOWLY get better over time. Today I am better but still have chest pain, ear ringing, and digestive issues every day. Please do research, know the effects it could have. I would take acne any day over this.",MVae

It has cleared up my acne fully... but at a cost of a barrage of side effects (excessive fatigue, constant peeing, irregular periods, anxiety, night terrors, mood swings, borderline low blood pressure). It's been exhausting combating the side effects and led me to stop the medication and go back to BC combo pill.I do recommend the drug since it works but only in low doses (25mg).

About a week after starting this medication the purge happened. I immediately started reading reviews and decided it was normal and it would be fast, furious and temporary.  By week 3 I had acne everywhere! My cheeks, nose, forehead etc. The doctor decided to up my dose to 100mg and also gave me 100mg of Doxycycline. She said it would kill the acne with 3 days. Another week went by and I was getting dizzy, dry, my left leg was going numb, headache was blinding and more acne now moving onto my neck. I let this go on until mid March. I flushed the medicine.

I didn’t hesitate to go on it but I did have doubts in my mind about wether it would work or not bc I have gone thru many pills. Before taking this pill I didn’t think I had hormonal acne because I had acne all over my face and in my mind hormonal acne was meant to be on the jawline and chin. The dr explained to me that she would like to put me on this pill because I had been telling her that my skin would break out like crazy and the calm down for like a week before breaking out again - a sign of hormonal acne. My derm. put me on 50 mg to take at night but that didn’t change anything so she raised my dosage to 100 mg. About 3 months after taking my first pill I saw major change in my face. Of course it gets better slowly which is why you’ll one day look back at pics and be like woah my skin really is a lot better!Didn’t have enough typing space to write more :(,Rach

Then shortly before I turned 21 I started getting acne on just my chin (combo of closed comedones and hard small cystic acne) and after about a month of dealing with the acne, hoping it would clear, I saw a dermatologist and asked to be put on spiro since I read good reviews. She told me it was for older women and just put me on tazorac .05% and aczone 7.5%. The tazorac completely tore up my face but after a month my skin got used to it and definitely was helping the texture of my chin but just not stopping the acne (plus taz made my skin super sensitive so when I would frown or move my face a lot my face/chin would turn kinda red... definitely unflattering and not a good topical for summer months) and the aczone was helpful but not stopping everything. Fed up with my derm, I saw a second derm who took one look at my face and suggested spironolactone and benzaclin (antiobiotic). I stopped the aczone and started the benzaclin which worked really well for a couple of weeks and then didn't work well so I stopped it entirely. I started on 25 mg spiro once a day for a month last November 2016. I didn't see results so my derm upped it to 50 mg in December. I started to see small results like decreased oil production on my face and hair but nothing truly impacting the acne. In January I went up to 75mg for a few weeks and then 100mg (50 twice a day) and that is where I am right now (March 2017) and my face for the first time summer 2016 is completely clear. I almost feel like I'm jinxing myself for typing that but it's been a full month without any sort of pimple (even during my period). I can also go two days without washing my hair and my hair would usually be oily by the end of the day so that is a HUGE plus... and the oil on my nose decreased by 95% I'd say.  I don't have any side effects, maybe just prone to headaches from dehydration (so definitely drink lots of water) and I have to get my blood tested for high potassium levels since its a diuretic and can make the body retain potassium. I still work out everyday and I don't feel fatigued or anything! I would definitely suggest spiro, it can take 2-3 months to truly get complete clearing but I'm so happy I waited it out.

Spironolactone was the best thing to ever happen to my skin!!! I started at 50mg daily, then after 2 weeks it was increased to 100mg daily. I noticed within 4-6 weeks that my skin was clearing up and I no longer was getting new breakouts.  I've been on it now for 10 months, and honestly I don't think I've even had one pimple in the past 2 or 3 months. This stuff is simply amazing. If you struggle with acne, I would recommend at least trying this. I never thought I would ever have clear skin, and I now have completely clear smooth skin. It's incredible. The only side effect I've had is fatigue, so I do take it at night before bedtime, and I wake up very well-rested.

I tried absolutely everything, the problem was definitely hormonal, so it makes sense to target hormones, no oil or bacteria. I take 50mg 2x a day and LOVE spironolactone. The first few days were a little weird but the side effects go away after 2-3 days. Just stay hydrated, the medicine is really very mild. My hormonal cystic acne improved almost immediately but then did have a milk breakout at 2 months. Now 3 months in and it is truly wonderful!! Keep with it! It works wonders on hormonal acne.
