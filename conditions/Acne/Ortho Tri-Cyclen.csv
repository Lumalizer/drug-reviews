1,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 19, 2020",10,"I have now been on this birth control for 3 months. I originally started because I was experiencing very bad hormonal acne on my neck and jawline that was not going away with expensive skincare products, or over the counter products. I had tried 2 other birth controls before settling on this one- they both made me extremely nauseous and groggy. I’m so glad I found this birth control. But you need to GIVE IT TIME. It won’t work immediately. You will experience acne purges, it’s not the birth control giving you acne, it’s your acne essentially purging itself out so you can have that clear skin. Besides helping my acne, my cramps are now bearable which is amazing since I’ve ALWAYS had super painful cramps. The only other side effect I’ve experienced was breast tenderness and breast growth which I’m not complaining about. No weight gain! This pill has been a life saver for me.",Pm

I’m in my mid 20s and suffered from acne for almost 3 years. I’ve tried everything and spent $$$ just to get rid of it. Birth control pills were prescribed by my derma, but the first brand that he gave me (Alesse) made me depressed, and way too emotional so I had to ditch that one. Tried to switch to another one but I’ve suffered way too many side effects, and tried two more before I landed on Ortho Tri-Cyclen. I’m on my 3rd month of using it and I have zero acne not whitehead in my face right now. I’ve had a breakout on my first month of using it, mostly around my chin and jaw area, but after that batch cleared up I haven’t worried about acne anymore.

6,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Acne,2.0,,"September 29, 2019",12,Started taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen for acne a month ago. During the time of the month it caused me to break out in places I never have before and also caused me to have large cystic acne on my chin and jawline. They were all in clusters and on the right side of my face. The doctor says it will get worse before it gets better but honestly don't know what to do.  Everybody is different and their body reacts different but I am ready to give up tbh.,ky

I’ve been on Ortho Tri Cyclen for about 4 months now (I’m on week 2 of month 4) and my severe acne has gone away. I do still have the occasional pimple around my jaw but its not as bad as before. I know my face is a lot better than before but I’m just confused as to how much longer my body is going to take for my skin to be completely clear?  I’ve read many reviews and people keep saying the longer I take it, the better my skin will be. But I’m starting to get very frustrated with the process. I don’t know if I should stay on the pill and wait it out? Or switch?",Sammy
9,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Acne,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 23, 2019",5,"After battling severe acne for around two years, I was prescribed ortho tri-cyclen by my doctor as I was weary of trying accutane (due to the side effects). When I first started this pill (mid June) my face broke out the worst it had ever before. I was so upset and felt so defeated but I continued to take it in hopes that the reviews of it working after a few months were true. Well, two months later my face is the clearest its been in SO long. I finally feel comfortable enough to go out without makeup. I went from have thirty zits covering my face to four-five. And even then, these are calming down. I can't wait to see the results from more months taking the pill. There were some side effects (depression, anxiety, nausea) but they lasted about two weeks and for me were bearable as I would tell myself, ""it's just the medicine"". I also switched skin care products to VivantSkin which have also worked wonders.",mcleev

I started taking this and the first two weeks my acne got worse and I was nauseous breast was tender and I felt pregnant and I almost gave up. It was very discouraging but I decided to stick it out and my face has cleared up 95%. I’ve had no breaks and I was getting at least 2 bumps a week.

I’ve used Xulane before with no improvement on my chin acne. I must say, I’ve always tried to stay away from dairy or sugar but I would always still break out on my chin, and it didn’t matter what day of the month. I always had acne on my chin. Starting off with the pill, I had about 8 painful zits on my chin. I noticed it beginning to clear after the second week. By the time I hit the sugar pills I began breaking out again on my chin and oddly in between my brows. I continued on to the second month, always breaking out during period week. By the third month though, my chin has been clear. I did get 1-2 tiny pimples during the week of my period, but they weren’t painful like how they used to be. I’ve never seen my chin clear in almost 8 years. No weight gain, but I was a bit moody the first month. Can’t tell if that was due to my recent breakup or hormones.",Maggie
19,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Acne,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 27, 2018",3,"Started taking Tricyclen to clear up my acne, and it worked pretty well for that.  When I started the pill I had an insatiable hunger and a bit of spotting.  Unfortunately, there were more negative side effects that actually got worse the longer I was on it.  Late into the second month I would randomly wake up in the middle of the night incredibly nauseous and throw up 2-3 times before passing out from exhaustion.  There was no pattern in when this would occur (i.e. didn't happen on any certain week of the pack) which made it very frustrating.  Additionally, I would bloat up like a balloon on the 3rd week.  I think the pill also made me more tired - usually around 5 or 6pm I would feel as if I could pass out for the night.The nausea was a major frustration for me, so I'm going to switch to Tricyclen Lo and see if that helps.",Anonymous

I’ve only been on it for three weeks the right side of my face is completely clear but the left side has a slight break out but that is the side I sleep on so that might have something to do with it.

NOPE NOPE NOPE. This BC broke me out in places I NEVER had issues with before! Now I thought it was my body adjusting so I gave it 6-7 months and still nothing! Broke me out so bad, constant red inflamed skin it was horrible and I was miserable and for my wedding day my skin was so bad.

Nausea was also a prevalent, everyday thing when taking the medication. Did I mention the mood swings? I felt like all my energy had been zapped from my body.

31,Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Acne,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 21, 2018",1,I was on this for 2.5 months and will never go back to Ortho Tri Cyclen. One huge side effect was that I had very bad nausea EVERY DAY along with migraines. I had so much nausea that I would gag at certain foods which I’ve never done in the past. I constantly felt full even when I skipped a meal. I can see how that would benefit people who are trying to lose weight but I’m already relatively thin trying to stay at a regulated weight. I used this to CLEAR my acne but it only made it worse— there are now twice  as many acne clusters than there were prior to taking this. My acne has never been this bad. The only positive about this medication is that it made my periods slightly lighter and it regulated them down to a T.,Sophie

My redness has completely calmed down and I rarely get breakouts, if I do it’s when I get my period. I won’t lie, the first month of side effects I was ready to give up.

She was ready to put me on accutane, but my mom didn't want to settle for that, so she did some research. I tried ortho tri-cyclen. After 3 months, my swollen lesions slowly disappeared.
