1,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 26, 2021",1,"I have suffered with Acne since I was very young. I was on Accutane for around 4 year’s continually as every time I stopped my acne would return. A few months ago, my acne returned with folliculitis. Tried all the antibiotics in the world and nothing at all cleared it. I didn’t want to return to accutane as I saw a private derm, it was incredibly expensive over the 4 years I spent around £4000+ and the side effects were troublesome. I saw my GP and after I explained my medical history for acne he recommended sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim: Honestly, the drug is amazing. I was on 400mg twice daily which was a high dose initially after a month on this dose, I went down to 200mg twice daily. After 2 months, my skin was absolutely spotless. I’d become obsessed with my skin checking it every 10 mins etc… sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim is an amazing drug and I would recommend to anyone over accutane.",Anonymous

In the past few years it mutated into giant bug bite-like swelling mostly around my mouth, chin, and forehead. Sometimes actually causing a fat lip that had to be injected with cortisone. It was beyond painful and embarrassing. It just kept getting worse. I was put on Sulfatrim 800/160 mg. I took 1 pill an hour before bed with 2 glasses of water. I've been on it for 38 days. My skin has not had a breakout since I started this antibiotic. I have not had any side effects either. Today my dermatologist said that I made his day when he looked at my skin and said it is beautiful. I can't explain to anyone how it feels to be free of cystic acne after what I've gone through. My skin is glowing and looks so healthy now. I am being put on a lower dose of 400/80 mg. I will continue this med for another 2 months then see where I'm at.

10,Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim,Acne,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 29, 2020",3,Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim):I started using bactrim a week into December due to a hormonal explosion of acne from my birth control (due to a reaction). It cleared me up slightly after 1 week but once week 2 hit I broke out horribly and on day 20 I discovered I was allergic to it. My face swelled HORRIBLY I am literally unrecognizable. Bactrim has left me with worse acne than I started with. My entire cheeks are covered. Now left to resort to accutane. Weird because I used to take this on and off in high school (I am now in college) and it worked wonders. I either developed a bacterial resistance to the drug or just became allergic over the years.  I highly recommend it if you've never taken it before and aren't allergic or can make it past the first month. I guess we will see how accutane works.,em

Yes it works for acne. Yes there is a terriable breakouting period. The breaking out lasts about 3 months I would say. Then you’ve got clear skin. The thing is that once you get off the pill your acne comes back full throttle. What my dermatologist forgot to point out was that you can not stay on this pill forever. It’s dangerous and very unhealthy. So basically I signed myself up for 4 months of clear skin to be met with even worse acne at the gate. I don’t recommend anyone to take this.

I have very oily skin, & get cystic acne usually around the time of my period. I also have blackheads & small breakouts occasionally. I’ve tried every Rx out there, including Accutane once in my 20’s & again in my 30’s. It’s very effective but unfortunately it’s not a complete cure for me. When my cystic acne flares up I use Bactrim and it’s amazing!! It clears my skin right up. It does have a very drying effect (which is fine since I’m so oily!) but it makes my lips chapped too. I only use it for 7-10 days a month. If I use it longer than that my lips start to peel & crack. So I take a break & use it at the first sign of trouble. It’s worth noting that I’ve tried doxycycline & minocycline with no results besides an upset stomach. So if you are considering taking Bactrim, do it! I use it with Retin-A.",KMC
