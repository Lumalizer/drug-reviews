0,Yaz,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 17, 2022",0,"I have only been on Yaz for acne and birth control for 6 weeks but so far everything is all good! Period started as normal and was regular, still the same length but hopefully will get shorter and lighter with time. My acne has improved and pimples don’t appear to be as bad. No mood swings, no weight gain and no vomiting . I did have a bit of nausea the first few days but that’s generally me so not sure what that was from. 100% recommend, I'm so happy with it!",Anonymous
1,Yaz,Acne,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 17, 2022",0,Definitely helped with acne but had a lot of side effects. My acne got better but it did not go away. I also experienced more cramps and mood swings in comparison to my previous birth control pill.,Sam
2,Yaz,Acne,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 16, 2022",0,I just finished my first month on Yaz and my acne is so so horrible :( before Yaz my acne was not even close to being this bad. Really discouraging as some people are commenting this is normal but some say it never got better for them.,brit
3,Yaz,Acne,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 7, 2022",0,"I have been taking a generic Yaz for a little over three months. I was hoping after reading reviews that by this point things would be clearing up, but over these past three months, my acne has only gotten progressively worse. I am now at the point where I have at least three cystic pimples on my face at a time, and by the time those clear there are already news ones popping up.",Bad
4,Yaz,Acne,1.0,,"February 7, 2022",0,"AVOID this birth control. I know some people have had good experiences with this pill, but it’s not worth the gamble. I began this birth control in hopes it would help regulate my period and help manage some light acne. Within days, my face broke out worse than ever before. I took this pill for almost 3 months hoping it would improve but only worsened. Not only did I get horrible acne; my face and arms bloated, I couldn’t fall asleep at all, my anxiety and depression got so bad I became suicidal. I spend a week in the mental hospital and stopped taking the pill. Within days of stopping my symptoms began to go away. The acne took a long time to clear but no new breakouts happened after stopping the pill. Please don’t risk your mental health and body for this birth control. There are much better options",Bernie
5,Yaz,Acne,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 12, 2022",1,"I've always had bad anxiety about new medications and scared myself quite a bit reading reviews when I first started taking this for PCOS. Luckily the only main symptoms of PCOS I had before were irregular bleeding/spotting and some acne. The first month wasn't horrible but wasn't great, my period lasted almost 2 weeks , I had some breast tenderness and some bad (but manageable cramping). However, after taking it for about 5 months now I can say it has dramatically improved my situation. I was nervous about gaining weight but I am a fit healthy person who works out so I actually ended up losing a few lbs. The best thing is that for the first time in my life I have a regular period, with minimal cramping and lighter flow. The only negatives are that if you don't take it at the same time or skip a pill you will immediately get breakthrough bleeding that can last for quite some time, and also my depression/anxiety has gotten a bit worse although I can't say for sure the Yaz has caused it.",cmppp
6,Yaz,Acne,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2022",1,"This is my first time writing a review because I OBSESSIVELY read all the reviews for Yaz while going through the ""just starting it time."" Tl;dr, my acne is better than it has ever been in my life. I'm on month five, but pack sixish (I tried skipping my period, didn't work for me). Nothing's ever worked for my cystic acne--I've tried everything except accutane. Yaz was my last resort before going onto the accutane. I was concerned because I was on a different birth control (Maxim) that was apparently also anti-androgen, but it didn't help. I do want to warn you, as many other commenters reported: my acne was THE WORST IT HAS EVER BEEN in the first 3 and a half months or so. Like, so bad I didn't want to leave the house, so bad I woke up before my boyfriend to put on make up and waited to wash my face until after he was asleep (spoiler alert: he couldn't care less. haha. but I did.) I'm left with some scarring and hyperpigmentation that's slowly going away. I'm feeling optimistic :)",Donna

My skin is looking a lot better but my libido is totally gone and I feel down most days. I have also gained weight that I can't shed off. I also have cysts in my breasts. I really want to try something else, I am hoping that I can just stay off hormones for at least a year but I know the acne might come back harder.",Anonymous
8,Yaz,Acne,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2021",1,"I have been on YAZ for month.  I am happy with how my acne improved! Gone in 3 days!  I lost 5lbs which my body was holding onto for years from other BC’s.  But on the last three days of the pack I experienced the most intense intrusive thoughts I’ve ever had in my life.  If I hadn’t been mindfully keeping track of every irregularity I was experiencing, I could have possibly committed suicide.  I do not have any prior mental health issues.  And I’m on day 3 of my new pack and have not had any intense thoughts in these three days.   Be extremely diligent with your birth control and track everything!  Every single thing out of the ordinary and tell someone you love exactly what’s going on so they can help you through finding the right set of hormones that will work for you.   I plan to continue to use YAZ and will continue to track my symptoms with the hopes I don’t experience the psychological issues again.  If I do, I will not be using this BC again.",Scary.
9,Yaz,Acne,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2021",2,"I have always struggled with acne, but when I turned 21 it became cystic. Before it became cystic I had already tried every antibiotic, accutane, tretinoin, aczone, etc. I got facials, light treatments, basically anything to help. When my acne became cystic, I went on Beyaz and was on it for a year and a couple months. After 3 months it cleared me completely- to the point where I was able to drop my skincare routine. I would fall asleep with makeup and wake up and have no new pimples, something I couldn’t even think of before. I stopped because it gave me horrible migraines. After 6 months being off of it I started breaking out again. I am now 23 and have seen a big worsening in the acne that has now made me try yaz. I figured it’s basically the same, so it should work. I am starting my 2nd pack and have not had any migraines at all and my mood is better! My face didn’t break out more on the 1st pack but it is now. I’m waiting it out. Will update!",nkak0309
10,Yaz,Acne,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2021",1,"been on Yaz for 3 months, decided to stop because I see no improvement at all. Also my weight DECREASES since I have no appetite at all.",sandyccv
11,Yaz,Acne,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 11, 2021",0,I couldn’t make it through the first pack. I almost did because I wanted to see if the side effects lessened. I could handle the mild fatigue but my anxiety was awful. Very bad physical and mental anxiety. I also felt emotionally blunted. This was sort of amazing at first because I genuinely believe it helped me get over someone I dated. But the anxiety was not worth the emotional regulation. I will say that it’s the only BC that didn’t give me a single pimple upon starting it. So that’s something. I’m sure my skin would be glowing after 3 or 4 months because BC usually makes me break out immediately. Only wish I could tolerate the anxiety!,anonymous
12,Yaz,Acne,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 10, 2021",0,My acne disappeared on Yaz however...so did my will to live. I developed severe anxiety and depressive symptoms and started having suicidal thoughts. This pill should be banned.,Jo jo
13,Yaz,Acne,,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 9, 2021",2,"I was hesitant on going on birth control  birth control. So far, Yaz is great. The Depo shot gave me bad side effects.Acne, mood swings anxiety. Came off of it, took me an entire year to regulate my acne and period. I have awfully heavy irregular painful periods. We suspect endometriosis (congenital for me) but aren’t  ready to diagnose. After depo, my skin felt better, still was blemishing only hormonal areas. My period would come and throw my pH out of whack and I’d wind up with BV. This is only my second week on Yaz however I started on the first day of my period as instructed. My hormonal acne areas seem to be clearing (light breakouts in different areas) from hormonal adjusting I think. My breast are growing. I had a light period with no BV. I will finish this month then come back. If you are struggling with BV,i rregular, painful or heavy periods, and hormonal acne then Yaz is worth a try.",Emilee
14,Yaz,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 28, 2021",1,"I was put on Yaz for my horrible hormonal acne. The first few months I was purging like crazy! I felt so defeated and wanted to stop. After 3 months my face has changed. My acne decreased tremendously. I am now at my 6th month and I have not broken out. My face is pretty much clear besides a few little scars and pigmentation. Furthermore, my period pains have gone away and my period has become so much lighter.",Anonymous
15,Yaz,Acne,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 12, 2021",0,"Only 5 months ago I remember looking at the reviews on this site trying to give myself hope that something would finally fix my adult hormonal acne. The first few months I noticed a slight decrease but it was still very prevalent and inflamed. Everyone says 3 months is the magic point and it was so true for me! Even going through a break up around the same time, my acne made a vast improvement from month 3 to month 4. Now just starting my 5th pack, I have near perfect skin except for the VERY occasional little pimple here and there and some acne scarring. I get compliments from so many people as to how much better my skin has gotten, and continues to get! I have even been able to finally stop using Tretinoin (a topical acne treatment) which helped my skin but also made it really sensitive and red. I feel so much more confident now with my skin and any post-inflammatory acne has completely gone for me. Stay strong after those first few months! Definitely worked for me!",Louise
16,Yaz,Acne,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2021",0,"Started this medication for a very brief period, less than 1 month and it made my face completely breakout with the worst cystic hormonal acne I have ever had. I had crying spells for no reason and I was sad everyday for 3 weeks. I have been off of it for about 1.5 weeks now but I still don't feel completely normal. The side effects were so bad for me I couldn't ""wait it out"" to get better like some people said it would.",anon
17,Yaz,Acne,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 20, 2021",1,"I started taking a generic form of Yaz for acne. Initially, things started to clear up. Then by the second month, I got terrible cystic acne—worse than I had ever had before this birth control. I was super desperate so I decided to try to eat as much anti-inflammatory foods as possible. I did that and all my acne started going away fairly quickly. I’m on month 3 of the generic Yaz and now I have no new pimples whatsoever. I am hopeful it will continue in this direction. I was also surprised that my diet still played such a large role in relieving the initial flare up and wanted to share for those desperate to improve their skin if it flared up like mine.",Heather
18,Yaz,Acne,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 7, 2021",2,"I’m on my 2nd packet of Yaz (going on to my third which I heard is when the magic happens) and before I had horrible acne for years especially on my back, chest, and jawline/cheeks it’s hormonal and caused by what I believe to be caused by too much testosterone! Although I still have acne my skin has improved so much my face is practically clear and my back has improved, considering this is only the second packet I’m really impressed and happy... I was so scared to start Yaz as I’ve heard so many horror stories but if you have PCOS or hormonal acne and your doctor suggests Yaz it’s worth a shot!! I’ll also update in a few months if my skin ever completely clears as this is only the second month and I still have acne - worth noting - your skin will get a little worse on the week break but I’m pretty sure that’s normal.",Anonymous
19,Yaz,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 3, 2021",0,"My doctor prescribed me Yaz to clear up my hormonal acne. I started Yaz two months ago, at the start I kept getting cystic acne bad on my neck, back and chin. My acne actually got worse the first month (pack) of being on Yaz, had the most painful and very heavy period. My acne started to clear up in the last week of the second pack. I'm now about to start my third pack and all of acne has gone, period cramps have completely gone, light flow and I feel great. You just have to be patient and trust that your hormones are adjusting and just give it some time.",Chloe
20,Yaz,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 25, 2021",2,"I’m on my third pack and absolutely love it! Initially went on for birth control that would also help moderate acne. Not only is my skin clear but I haven’t put on any weight and my breasts are definitely bigger. I’d guess 2 cup sizes. They often feel a little sore, but that’s a small price to pay. Worth noting that I did have a 3 week period at the beginning but continued taking the pill as I loved it so much and my period has now settled. The most recent one lasted around 4 days. Cannot say enough good things about this pill.",Fran
21,Yaz,Acne,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 22, 2021",0,"So I’m kinda having mixed feelings about Yaz. I started yaz almost a year ago to help with my acne. And yes it cleared my acne 100% and saved my skin. BUT, I do feel like I have some other random side effects? My first month on it I was very depressed which eventually went away. But my periods are still very irregular and I usually never fully bleed? If that makes sense. I mainly just feel like it’s also messed with my pH balance. I was on Blisovi Fe for about 3 years before I switched to Yaz. While I was on blisovi I never really had periods or symptoms but towards the last few months I was on it my acne started to get pretty severe, which is why I switched to Yaz. So yes Yaz saved my skin my I do feel like it’s messed with my overall balance in my hormones.",pancakes33
22,Yaz,Acne,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 22, 2021",0,"I had almost perfect skin for all of high school, and then all of a sudden, I’m 19 with huge cystic pimples on my jawline and chin. My dermatologist first recommended an antibiotic for the pimples, but it didn’t help at all. I also tend to pick at my skin so it was a bad combo. My gyno put me on the generic Yaz, and I was really worried. I didn’t want to resort to hormones to fix my skin, but I had tried EVERYTHING else. So I started my first pack! My skin just looked HORRID the first month of it. Every morning I would wake up to a new cystic friend on my jawline. Then around month three it all started to clear up. If I felt something brewing, the pimple would kinda disappear on its own (which is so new to me since I always tried to pop them). I am now going into month 5 and I can see true improvement. I only have the occasional cystic pimple (singular!) but I haven’t seen much clear up of some closed comedone pimples between my brows or on my forehead. My boobs are bigger!",Kath
23,Yaz,Acne,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 17, 2021",3,My daughter tried Yaz because her friend had a good result.  She used to have mild acne.  Within a week she broke out in huge inflammatory acne which has spread all over her cheeks.  She stopped 6 weeks in because it wasn’t getting any better and it was severe.  Now 12 weeks later she is still breaking out and it hasn’t stopped.  She is starting accutane tomorrow.  Do not take this product.  It ruined my daughters skin and have been told it will likely leave scars.  Her doctor said some girls are just very sensitive to the ingredients.  Some aren’t.  It’s a crap shoot.  I wish I knew.  I wish we can turn back time.  I’m devastated by what’s happened to her.,Horrible!!
24,Yaz,Acne,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 16, 2021",0,"I am so grateful for the reviews here. I had struggled with breakouts on my chin since my teens but this summer I got terrible cystic acne on my chin. I was so self conscious I couldn’t leave the house. I’m now 28 and was really over having acne. I was put on Yaz and saw no improvements in the first month, I read reviews on here and they said to stick it out for 3 months. I am now near the end of my 3rd month and I have relatively no breakouts on my skin. I am so so grateful to everyone here who told me to stick it out and I urge anyone starting to do the same! I finally have my confidence back and feel like I can go out and do normal things again. The only side effects I had from this drug was increase in breast size and slight decrease in mood in the first month! Highly recommend for acne sufferers.",Ali
25,Yaz,Acne,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 20, 2021",1,"Im currently finishing my second pack and unfortunately the only good thing I can say now about Yaz is that it made my rather small boobs to grow visiblyHowever, I was prescribed Yaz mainly to eliminate my hormonal acne and in this case I'm still waiting for promised results. My acne since starting the pill got worse, I get new pimple every two days (before the pill my face broke out about once/twice a month. But I will continue taking it for at least two more months, since a lot of people reported positive changes after 3-4 months of taking it and I'm still not losing hope!!!What was the most worrying was that I noticed some changes in my mood from time to time. I get angry more easily, but the worst were the times when I started crying and I didn’t even had a reason or the reason was very petty, and I just couldn’t stop, even though I knew it’s probably only due to the pill. Other negative effect was insomnia - a few times I couldn’t fall asleep whole night",gab
26,Yaz,Acne,5.0,,"August 13, 2021",18,The only reason I went on Yaz was to help with my acne I was getting a few cyst every month lots of blackheads a few pimples here and there I am just about to finish my 2nd pack and I just want to cry my acne is so bad right now really hoping by month 3 it all magically disappears did not experience any other side effects will update in a month or so,Brooklyn
27,Yaz,Acne,4.0,,"August 6, 2021",1,"I am currently on my second pack of Yaz, only a few days left. I have had a few horrible side effects. Firstly, since starting yaz I have had 3 extreme yeast infections due to the pill. To add, my vagina is not lubricated anymore, its very dry and I struggle to have sex, it is painful. The pill has weakened my immune system giving me tonsillitis and a coldsore (which I haven't had in 4 years now). I am bleeding in between when the fake period is supposed to occur. I have a constant sore lump in my left boob. It has made me depressed, irritated. As for my skin - it has stayed the same. I am thinking of stopping the pill after this second pack because clearly my body does not like it. It has made sex unenjoyable and can i can barely do it due to yeast infections and no lubrication! Just want my normal body back - I don't think it is worth going through all this for clear skin. I am worried that my vagina will not go back to its normal state if i continue on this pill.",gg
28,Yaz,Acne,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 27, 2021",1,"I switched to Yaz from Ortho-Cyclen and have been on it for almost two years. After 6 months, I noticed that I had significantly less acne. It has also kept me from getting pregnant. I haven't gained any weight and had fewer cramps during my period. For mild side effects, I did get worse headaches during my period and spotting. I have a lowered libido too. But the worst side effect for me is anxiety and depression. I started having panic attacks and bouts of depression only months after starting the pill. I also became very paranoid and jealous in my relationship, which was (likely) unfounded. I've realized that my sanity is more important than the positives this pill has brought. If you have underlying/undiagnosed anxiety or depression, it's possible that the yaz pill can exacerbate this. I will be stopping Yaz next month and exploring other options to take care of my mental health.",lilycsi

Other birth controls have caused me weight gain, depression, and mood swings. I have lost weight on Yaz and my mood seems stable which is good. My boobs have grown a TON, even with the weight loss they’ve grown at least a cup size. (Disclaimer: I dieted & exercised to lose the weight the medicine didn’t make me lose it)The only negative side effect is that once I started my period I have been bleeding/spotting for almost two months now.

30,Yaz,Acne,8.0,,"April 29, 2021",15,"My doctor put me on Yaz for post-pill acne and said to try it for 3 months and see how I liked it. It made my skin TERRIBLE for the first 2 months. Extreme purging of acne on my chin and jaw. It also made me very emotional. I was so close to stopping taking it but I wanted to remain hopeful after the 3 month period, things would get better so I suffered through the purging. I’m just about to start month 4 and I have had no acne for the last 2 weeks and my skin is almost perfect. I’m stuck with some post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from the purging but concealer can cover it up while my vitamin C serum does its thing. My face feels so soft and completely clear as of right now and my period is so light with minimal cramping. My insurance covers almost the entire cost of it so I’ll stick with it for a while and see if it keeps my skin clear!

I don't get cystic pimples on my chin during the time of the month anymore thankfully but I still get pimples on my cheeks and chin which leads to hyperpigmentation. They're smaller ones.

I really wanted it to work so bad and I feel devastated that it didn't work as good as how it worked on others.These pills made me quite emotional during the first few months of using them and still become emotional there and then.

Accutane was the best but my acne came back after 2 years as my new dermatologist said my previous derm did not give me the right dosage. I don't want to go back to the medication as I know the side effects of this in the long run. That's why I decided to just go with the ""contraceptive pill"" route. I'm on my first pack of Yaz. Side effect: Mild headaches during afternoon and cleared my face on week 1 then its worst now on week 2 going week 3.

36,Yaz,Acne,5.0,,"April 9, 2021",4,"PRO: very clear skin, didn't experience any hair-loss or anything. CON: weight gain and lack of energy/enthusiasm. I was 18 when my skin suddenly flared up (after having pretty good skin all of high school). It was awful. I was up late at night on YouTube and Google looking for advice. I was first on manerva birth control pill for about a year. It cleared my skin fairly well but I gained so much weight. And I was shocked because my whole life my friends have envied how I can eat whatever rubbish I like and not put on a stitch of weight. That was me. Twig with no breasts. I switched to YAZ hoping to lose weight. The transition was smooth but I continued to gain weight. 20kg. I'm 24 now and I'm too scared to switch pill because of all the reviews I read. I went off the pill for 9 months and my skin hit me hard again. My energy was back though I felt so alive and so enthusiastic. The pill makes me a zombie.

Once about 2 weeks after starting Yaz when I started to break out after having perfect skin (I’ve been on Accutane three times and my skin was finally perfect) and then again at the start of the second pack when things got better... or so I thought.. I’m on the third week of my third month so basically meaning that I’ve been taking Yaz for almost 3 months and man oh man my skin has been the worst it’s been while on Yaz this month. I have bumps all around my mouth and jaw which I understand is hormonal. The texture of my skin is oily and bumpy and it makes me super self conscious. I’m giving Yaz three more weeks and if I don’t see serious improvement I’m getting off of it and will try something else. Besides the acne I do like Yaz (no bloating, no weight gain, has helped with my period which is why I went on birth control in the first place) but I just want perfect skin again.

40,Yaz,Acne,1.0,,"March 12, 2021",7,"I took Yaz for a MONTH and it messed me up.

I continued to break out throughout the first and second pack and it honestly really took a toll on my self confidence!! I've been on Accutane 3 times and my skin was absolutely perfect after the third time so breaking out once I started taking Yaz was extremely disheartening! I read a BUNCH of comments saying to be patient and wait 3-4 months because that is when you'll notice it starting to regulate to your body and your skin to get better. I just started my third pack AND I AM SO SO HAPPY TO SAY that my skin has gotten SO much better and my period has gotten shorter and lighter!! I went on Yaz solely because I have an absolutely terrible period (horrible cramps and insanely heavy) so I am beyond happy that it is so much better now! I am so much more confident now!!!!

From what I read, that’s normal for a lot of people, and I’m so thankful I stuck through it. My skin has never been clearer. My periods are normally extremely heavy, painful, 9 days, and I only have one or two days of moderate flow on Yaz. A major bonus.I did notice over the last five months that I have started to break out on my chin and neck only on the placebo days of the pack but skipping them fixed that issue. I’ve not had issues with mood or libido on Yaz, no spotting, headaches, really no other side effects.I recommend sticking through for a few months.

I have done everything from dermatologist prescribed topical creams to changing my diet, and revamping my skincare routine. Literally nothing worked. I am now on the start of my 3rd month of Yaz.

I've been taking it for 6 or 7 months now and it's cleared my skin A LOT I used to have acne on my back, chin, cheeks, forehead, physically anywhere there was skin, there was a pimple... but now I only have 3 on my entire face and 1 on my back which is amazing.

When I started taking Yaz my acne didn’t go away right away but after a few months it seemed like all my acne went after over night. I currently have no acne nor do I get pop ups of it. However, I never get my period when I take the sugar pill, it always comes when I’m suppose to start taking my hormone birth control pill. So I have my period while I’m taking my birth control? It also has changed my discharge from the normal consistency to a straight liquid consistency which isn’t comfortable or flattering when I feel like I have to wear a panty liner/tampon all the time or else my underwear is soaked. Great for acne and birth control but the side effects I received were not fun.",Zo

Dealing with it was very hard, it was painful and just horrible to look at. After 3 months my skin started to clear up like crazy! It use to be crazy bumpy with many pimples and now my skin is very smooth with less than 4 active pimples and I no longer am in pain. ACNE WILL GET SO MUCH WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER. Please stick through it because I was one of those people who thought it wasn’t going to get better.  Pros: skin eventually cleared up, weight stayed the same, my boobs grew a lot bigger (I went from a B to a C). I now have very light and short periods compared to before. I also barely get cramps anymore, and they aren’t very painful (they use to be horrible).  It also is working as a contraceptive. Cons: my boobs were sore almost everyday but as the months went by it now feels normal.",mt

I was reading reviews here almost everyday just for inspiration lol.

I used to have bird legs and after taking it for about a year my thighs and butt blew up.

For the first 6 months, my period was irregular, it would come whenever it wanted and last a full 5 days but now my period is the day after I take the sugar pill and ends the day after I stop it. They have been extremely light and no cramping or PMS at all. It did make me a bit moody but not much more than normal. The side effects were nothing compared to the benefits it did for me. The only reason I’m off of it is because they didn’t call in a refill so I’m trying the shot so I don’t keep running into this problem. Overall, Yaz was the absolute best thing to happen to me!

I went straight back on it and had to wait another 4 months for my skin to clear up. Don’t make the same mistake as me. If you go on it for acne, stay on it!

I had pretty bad acne since 6th grade all the way up through high school. My acne was cystic and covered nearly my entire face. It really made me insecure and caused me to seclude myself from group activities and just hanging out with friends. My sophomore year at college I started taking YAZ in the month of January and my acne completely cleared up within 2 to 3 months. This helped me socialize more and I am now not as self conscious.

The week after I decided to switch my birth control pill of over 14 years, my anxiety suddenly disappeared and has not returned (6 months  so far with ZERO anxiety).

165,Yaz,Acne,1.0,,"December 12, 2016",17,I'm 27 years old and I have always had beautiful skin until recently. I started taking yaz two months ago for my severe acne. I'm all honesty I don't see any difference . My face itches terribly everyday and my acne seems to get even worse. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so self conscious and I can't even look people in the eye because I don't feel or look beautiful any longer. Please help,SOS please........
166,Yaz,Acne,10.0,,"December 12, 2016",10,"I used Yaz when I was in varsity as I had SEVERE acne. it took a couple of months to clear but when it did, my skin was completely clear!! I used it straight through for about 8 years. I decided to stop using it for about a year as I am much older now and assumed my hormones were in balance. It took about 4 months for my acne to start re-appearing and now its worse than ever again!! So I'm going back on Yaz and I'm on month two and my acne keeps worsening each day! I'm just trying to be patient and hopefully soon it will clear my skin again!

I noticed a significant clear-up in my breakouts, but it wasn't enough to outweigh the side effects: nausea/vomiting, diharrea, breast tenderness, mood swings, and migraines. The final straw came with a sudden lingering pain accompanied by swelling in my upper right leg that lasted for several hours before abating. I have nothing to confirm that this was a blood clot or was related to the drug, but further research revealed to me that YAZ is currently under thousands of lawsuits due to debilitating and fatal blood clots in seemingly healthy girls.

I have been on this pill for nearly 3 months and am so anxious to change it. There has been no positive change regarding my acne issues. My depression has gotten worse as a side effect. Usually my PMS starts a day or two before my period, but on Yaz it starts around a full week prior and it's a lot more intense. When I was on Tri-Lo I only got cramps a bit, and they weren't very painful. On Yaz, I've gotten cramps for each period and each time has been increasingly painful. I get yeast infections before every period. I have never gotten a yeast infection before using Yaz!!!",distinct

My skin is literally beautiful to the point that my friends will comment how good my skin is.Last year, I decided to give the non-hormonal IUD ParaGard a try because I didn't want the hassle of taking a pill every day.

I'm also on a whole bunch of medications for epilepsy so the fact that this pill can level my emotions is pretty fantastic. I haven't experience any muscle pain, acne worsening, or any other of the side effects other people have mentioned. Guess it depends on the person.

My periods are much lighter and regular, except for when I missed one. That didn't end well.I am three months in now, but then I heard that in Canada alone, many people have died from thrombosis directly linked to the use of Yaz.

I did break out worse for the first three months but then my skin was completely clear, I did not gain weight in fact I lost two pounds at first, and it did make my boobs bigger, and they were sore at first but nothing terrible.

I noticed a significant difference in my skin within the first month and now my skin is completely clear with the exception of the occasional bump or two around my period. I get the typical mood swings around my period but nothing too crazy. I have noticed I feel a little more anxious since I've started taking it but it isn't extreme.

They didn't and now I'm stuck on the pill  that's still giving me acne (albeit not as bad as before) too scared to stop.  I feel like I'm being held hostage by Yaz.   It also gives me my period two weeks out of the month.  Worst decision of my life.   I've never posted on something like this before – but the experience was so awful I thought I had to warn others.

Anyway, Yaz was invented quite recently. So, girls and women, if you have hormonal problems, Yaz is the best thing around. I can put WHATEVER on my skin now (like night creme), and my skin is perfect. No clogged pores, no inflammation, nothing.
