0,Vibramycin,Acne,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 31, 2020",34,"I got off minocycline a month and a half ago after 6 months of successful treatment with it for my acne, & no side effects (mild to moderate inflamed acne here). Acne started coming back so my derm put me on doxycycline (I use azelaic acid 15% once a day topically too). I've been only 4 days on doxy 100mg twice daily & my skin is completely clear again. Zero side effects with this as well. The inflammation subsided in just 2 days. It has saved my skin once again. Tetracyclines work so well for me it's hard to get off of them.",anon
