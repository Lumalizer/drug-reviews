So far I’ve had my period 3 times this month lasting around 1-3 days. Before I started birth control I didn’t have bad skin, just breakouts when my menstrual cycle began. Ever since starting birth control I’ve had so many breakouts, to the point where I don’t want to be seen. Yes my acne isn’t as bad as others, but it’s still bothersome, when I went on this medication to fix this problem.",maria
1,Junel,Acne,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 2, 2019",16,"I am on the pill first and foremost for birth control. My skin was so bad, more than it ever had been, so I had my Dr put me on a pill that was better for acne than the one I was on. There is a few negatives. I have gained a little weight (this could be related to other stuff though) and I have virtually no sex drive but thats on any pill for me. This pill FOR ACNE WORKS. This pill helped to completely change my skin like I never had been able to achieve before. My skin was so blotchy and uneven and rough and I still got whiteheads and I had not left the house without foundation since I was 16. I’m 29 now and the only time I wear foundation now is for special occasions. Very grateful for the clear skin I have now.",Ac
2,Junel,Acne,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 17, 2018",6,"I usually have medium acne-nothing some foundation and concealer can’t cover. However, I really wanted to finally clear my skin up, (and was also having problems with my period) so my OBGYN suggested Lomedia 24 Fe. After the first week or two, my acne was terrible. So so bad, I couldn’t even stand it. I started getting cystic acne all over my cheeks and these huge pimples on my forehead. After reading other reviews that said the same thing, I quit the pill. My acne has finally gone away and my face is back to how it used to be. Even if it’s not perfect, I’ll take this over the horrible acne I got from this  pill. Do not use.",Natalie
3,Junel,Acne,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 29, 2018",3,"I have been on this pill for a little over a year now. I didn’t make the connection until I looked it up today, but my acne got so much worse right around the time I started it. My skin was never perfect but I would only really have small pimples on my forehead. The last year I have had huge cystic pimples covering my jawline and cheeks that are constant. It has made me so depressed and self conscious. Not to mention this pill has made my periods super irregular and even more painful than they already were before. I am getting an IUD soon and can not wait to stop taking this pill for good! I would never recommend this pill to anyone especially if you’re hoping to improve your acne!!",Andy
4,Junel,Acne,3.0,,"July 19, 2018",0,"Meh. I got on Blisovi Fe 1.5/30 for acne and PMDD. It cleared up my acne a lot at first and made my periods significantly lighter for a little while, cramps weren’t there and periods were a decent length. However, I noticed a huge weight gain on this BC. Painful bloating and made me super self conscious. My face has definitely blown up a lot and it especially does around my period time. I drink a lot of water and try to stay active to prevent  most of this but it hasn’t budged. The only time I lost weight was when I was over exercising and barely eating on this pill but obviously that isn’t realistic. Cravings are awful on this too. Mentally I’m ok I guess and I have a history of depression & anxiety. Just really self conscious and lost a lot of my confidence.Unfortunately it’s time for me to switch to a different pill. Past 3 months symptoms of my PMDD have been coming back and my periods have been awful again. Skin is breaking out bad as well.",Meh
5,Junel,Acne,1.0,,"May 23, 2018",1,"I've been on this pill for 9 months. Within those 9 months I've gained 20 lbs. I've always been between 108-113 and now I'm 130!! I don't fit  into any of my clothes. I have become super hungry and bloated. Not to mention it did NOTHING for my acne!! I was on Yaz for a couple years and it did WONDERS for my acne. Then I was having two week periods because I would miss a pill so they switched me to this. I read online the best pills for acne contain drospirenone which is in Yaz, yazmin, ocella, etc. so she put me back on Yaz because I never gained weight with that and it did wonders for my acne. I'll update after taking Yaz for a month and let you know if I have lost the weight and better acne. This pill didn't make my acne worse than it was before birth control, but it did not help one bit.",Marfi
6,Junel,Acne,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 8, 2018",0,The one good  thing this pill did is shorten my periods to 4 light days. I have never had acne and then I started with a few pimples here and there and now my forehead is always covered in them. I thought it was because I went away to college but I wasn't even that stressed. It wasn't until my mom pointed it out that I realized it could be the birth control. I have been on it for almost two years with no improvements in my skin. Another good thing - I used to have migraines with aura frequently and now I get maybe one or two a year. But my skin has become almost cystic acne!! I made an appointment to get another form and I hope my skin clears up.,T

I hadn’t made the connection between my serious acne (and other issues), until my mom suggested I google norethindrone and acne and found this. While taking this pill my face has transformed from smooth and minimal pores to dozens of cystic THROBBING and PAINFUL pimples. I also have had similar mood swings, depression, weight gain and a constant feeling of bloating and puffiness in my face. Basically the worst period of the year amplified everyday. I tried so many creams, gels, facewashs and masks, not to mention went gluten free, dairy free and even vegetation for multiple weeks and increased my water intake substantially to see if that was the problem, but NOTHING CHANGED AND ONLY GOT WORSE.",Anonymous

I'm almost at my fifth month of taking Microgestin and I rarely break out now. I've definitely been noticing that my skin looks better.

Ginanvi had cleared up my acne in the short time I used and I was hoping this birth control would not mess that up. I was wrong. After 2-3 months of using this pill my skin went crazy with horrible breakouts. Now, 9 months later I still have horrible acne. If you want a pill that helps with acne this is NOT it. It also made my period ""weird"". I would have little to no period one month and a heavy one the next . The month that I had a heavier flow my boobs would hurt a lot. I also noticed that at the beginning of taking it , I would be moody and extremely irritable all the time . It's time for me to switch.",CamB

I cry over how bad my face has gotten in the month I've been on this pill. My doctor told me it would take 3 weeks to work, yet told me 3 whole packs (3 months) a different time. I wish I never got on this. I was on Yaz for a month and it did wonders for my face, but made me incredibly nauseous. I'd rather go back to that in all honesty. Wish I read these reviews sooner.

Until starting, my (then) clear, flawless skin was the thing I liked best about myself. HOWEVER, within a month, this had truly RUINED my skin forever. Excessive and deep cystic acne that did not respond to any dermatologist treatments and sent me into a spiral of low self-esteem. Gyno insisted I stick with it for 6 months to see if it evened out. IT DID NOT! Instead, what I've been left with is unresponsive acne for the past two years (yes...1.5 years after I stopped taking this) because of this horrible pill.

In these 3 months I noticed my skin slowly getting worse (mainly jawline and down my neck) and I was also having no periods and was also feeling moody and tired all the time.  My doctor wanted me to stick with the pill for an other 3 months to see if everything started to even out. At month 5 I have cystic acne down my neck.

I'm on it for my acne because I've suffered from acne for 5 years and I am glad to say it is helping.. On my first month my period came on time and only lasted 4 days however I've recently been cramping but nothing too serious. This pill made me gain a few pounds and I've been very angry and emotional. A lot of my friends and family want me to stop taking it because they say my emotions have been extremely heightened. This pill has not affected my sex drive. I've read a lot of negative reviews on this but I personally don't think it's bad. It's effective and it's hormones so what do you expect? I recommend for a cheaper and effective birth control especially of you suffer with acne.,Junebug96

Even though my periods are less bleeding and less days, I have had a lot of side effects! I work out regularly and eat healthy yet I have gained over 10 lbs from when I first started talking this, my mood switches too often and I usually feel mad a lot of the time, and my face and hair has became extremely oily and greasy within the last few months.

It was hormonal acne and it was relatively painful and I was getting a new pimple almost everyday (all in my T-Zone). When I started the birth control my skin got worse and there was a decent amount of spotting. My skin continued to break out badly for the first two month of birth control. But I highly suggest waiting it out because now on the fourth month my skin looks better than it has in quite a while, and any pimple I randomly get is not nearly as painful, and in the end the birth control kept my acne from scarring my face.

My friend was also on this pill but didn't have the same cystic situation. My word of advice is if your prone to cystic acne don't take this pill. The only think I liked about this pill was no mood changes, less pms, larger breasts and minimal weight gain.",Abug20
