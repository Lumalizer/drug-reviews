0,Bactrim,Acne,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 1, 2022",3,"I went into an acute respiratory failure after taking Bactrim for acne for only 3 weeks. I was hospitalized for over a month. After multiple painful procedures and a lung biopsy later, I responded to prednisone. I was one of the lucky ones. There is a reason why the FDA updated the label for this drug with this specific warning since otherwise healthy kids my age have had the same reaction and some have passed away as a result.",Ave19

I just realized it was probably the bactrim haha at least one good thing came from this poison ivy! As far as the poison ivy, my arm was still fairly red and swollen by the end of the week but my Dr told me to wait and see and it is a lot better now a few days later. (I don't remember what the dosage was but they were pretty sizeable oval pills with the line across the middle and I was only on it for one week.)",blc20497
2,Bactrim,Acne,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 29, 2020",3,I started using bactrim a week into December due to a hormonal explosion of acne from my birth control (due to a reaction). It cleared me up slightly after 1 week but once week 2 hit I broke out horribly and on day 20 I discovered I was allergic to it. My face swelled HORRIBLY I am literally unrecognizable. Bactrim has left me with worse acne than I started with. My entire cheeks are covered. Now left to resort to accutane. Weird because I used to take this on and off in high school (I am now in college) and it worked wonders. I either developed a bacterial resistance to the drug or just became allergic over the years.  I highly recommend it if you've never taken it before and aren't allergic or can make it past the first month. I guess we will see how accutane works.,em

So my dermatologist put me on this bactrim and it worked. In the months time my skin is cleared up and if I do have a zit occasionally it comes to head super quick and heals quickly. My back and chest had tiny little zits over it and now it’s nothing but smooth skin. Even my husband has said he notices that this is actually working. I didn’t really have any of the side effects a little nausea and thirst the first week but that was it, after that nothing.",Anonymous

I took it on and off throughout my first year of college and then stopped completely a year ago. My acne kinda came back and now I am on birth control which has completely RUINED MY SKIN. I am starting bactrim again this week as I am now a junior in college and hope to see good results like before. My skin was the best it ever was when I was taking this and I had no side effects,ash

8,Bactrim,Acne,10.0,,"May 3, 2020",24,"I have been on Bactrim Rx for about three weeks now and I already see a DRAMATIC improvement in my skin. All my cystic bumps are gone, haven’t had any active breakouts since the day I started it. My skin feels smooth and looks alive and glowing. My only problem was that it made me very nauseous (as most antibiotics do for me) so I would have to take it after I full meal. But I highly recommend talking to your dermatologist about this medication if you are tired of suffering and being depressed about your skin. It’ll be 100% worth it!",Kay
9,Bactrim,Acne,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 8, 2020",12,This definitely works! It took about six months to clear my face. I have cystic acne and it never was to bad but I tried proactive and it made my face really breakout. I was really embarrassed to go anywhere. My doctor had me try bactrim. I just hate having a really dry throat. I stopped for awhile but decided to try it again since I’m stressed and my chin area started to breakout again. For those of you stopping it after a few weeks or months and saying doesn’t work you didn’t give bactrim a real chance to clear your skin. I use clearasil pads and bactrim. They work wonders. I have light scars on my face but bactrim made me feel pretty again!,Leesh
10,Bactrim,Acne,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2020",8,"Two weeks into my twice daily Bactrim RX & suddenly I felt like if I did not lie down, I would FALL down (EXTREME Exhaustion feeling out of nowhere) Then I noticed I had a fever. I slept all morning & most of afternoon.Woke feeling fine. ...UNTIL that evening, when once again I felt like if I did not lie down, that I would FALL down. And, once again a fever. I went to bed very early, slept until morning. Next morning I woke feeling much better. Figured I was coming down with something and gosh, at least I'm on an antibiotic. BUT shortly after taking the morning Bactrim I had the exhaustion/fever slam me again. That is when the lightbulb finally went on that this was BACTRIM doing this to me. As I lie there shivering, I noticed my lip starting to itch.  I discontinued the Bactrim and did well.   = Allergy to Bactrim/Sulfa drugs.",CrazyAlpacaLady
11,Bactrim,Acne,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 25, 2020",12,"I took Bactrim for my cystic acne for the first time a few days ago. Took my first dose a few hour before bed, and started to notice my tongue and mouth going numb. I took 2 Benadryl to sooth the symptoms. The next morning I called both my pharmacist and doctor, and told me that it was definitely an allergic reaction. Fast forward a few days later, my mouth has the same symptoms as if I burned my mouth on something scolding hot! My tongue has an entire layer burned off, as well as my inner left cheek, with blisters inside of my mouth. Needless to say I’m definitely allergic to this medication. They then prescribed my minocycline, but I’m very afraid to even attempt to try it after this experience!",Catherine
12,Bactrim,Acne,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 4, 2020",12,I promised that after I tried this I would share my experience. Yes it works for acne. Yes there is a terriable breakouting period. The breaking out lasts about 3 months I would say. Then you’ve got clear skin. The thing is that once you get off the pill your acne comes back full throttle. What my dermatologist forgot to point out was that you can not stay on this pill forever. It’s dangerous and very unhealthy. So basically I signed myself up for 4 months of clear skin to be met with even worse acne at the gate. I don’t recommend anyone to take this. It gave me false hope and knowing the struggles of acne I hope that know one has to go through this. Best of luck to everyone.,Sadnessacne
13,Bactrim,Acne,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 10, 2019",5,This drug worked wonders for me. I  took it for 3.5 years and had clear skin finally. But I got bacterial resistance and ended up with worst and more acne scars than I did have before. My dermatologist should have told me what to do at first signs of it becoming resistance. My advice is to make a plan in case that happens to you beforehand. It was great when it worked but iIwas mad at my doc for not letting me know what could happen if it stopped working.,Anonymous

Things were fine until I reached age 25 or so and then I started breaking out again.  This time around tetracycline did nothing, tried minocycline along with a few other antibiotics and they did not work either. I was on Accutane for about 6 months and that worked while I was taking it but not so much after I stopped.  Finally my dermatologist put me on Bactrim and that worked like magic!

15,Bactrim,Acne,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 4, 2019",12,"I got severe acne when I was fourteen years old, from cystic, to regular papules and pustules. There wasn’t a clear spot on my face, back, chest, or shoulders. I went to my PCP, and tried benzoyl peroxide cleanser. That didn’t work, and so I tried doxycycline and then minocycline, and they didn’t work either. Then I got referred to the dermatologist, and he wanted to start me on accutane, but I didn’t like the side effects, so he prescribed me Bactrim. I took a break last year, and started up again this year when it started becoming moderate to severe again. I honestly like the medication. It’s cleared my skin the best, and I haven’t had any side effects from it. I started it in 2017, and it’s now 2019. All I have to do is take it for a short time twice a day, then wean off of it; and if my skin acts up again, I do that again.",Lizzayyyeee

19,Bactrim,Acne,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 8, 2019",26,"I have had severe acne since I was 10 (I’m 35 now). I have very oily skin, & get cystic acne usually around the time of my period. I also have blackheads & small breakouts occasionally. I’ve tried every Rx out there, including Accutane once in my 20’s & again in my 30’s. It’s very effective but unfortunately it’s not a complete cure for me. When my cystic acne flares up I use Bactrim and it’s amazing!! It clears my skin right up. It does have a very drying effect (which is fine since I’m so oily!) but it makes my lips chapped too. I only use it for 7-10 days a month. If I use it longer than that my lips start to peel & crack. So I take a break & use it at the first sign of trouble. It’s worth noting that I’ve tried doxycycline & minocycline with no results besides an upset stomach.

I was ready to do anything to get rid of my acne. I went and visited a dermatologist, he prescribed me Bactrim with spironolactone.  The first two weeks I would say I kinda got a breakout but then after like four weeks my skin was clear, acne free. I still got some scaring, but no active acne which is good. One side effect I would say is that I felt very tired and sleepy. I would defiantly say try this before going on accutane.",Neelab

I can only add my highest recommendation for Bactrim to treat my cystic acne, the kind that produces cysts around 2-3 cm in diameter all over my body and face. I've been on Accutane and every other antibiotic there is, but the Bactrim has saved me. It is hard on your digestive system, and I still haven't come up with a good solution for that yet, but I can certainly live with it if it means no more painful cysts which need to be cut out and operated on medically (no fun at all).

My face acne has been considered mild, but my acne on my back and chest is moderate to severe. They tried many oral and topical medications, creams/gels on me. Nothing worked. Then finally the last dermatologist I found, he prescribed me to Bactrim 160/800. I can't remember how long I was on it the first time before it kicked in and started working, but I was on it for 2-3 years with absolutely perfect skin. I recently got pregnant and had to stop taking it. My acne slowly came back. Now, I had my son a month ago. My acne is back and is awful. I was able to get prescribed Bactrim again 2 weeks ago (apparently it's safe while nursing). I'm still anxiously waiting for it to kick in.. But I have hope, and know it will.
