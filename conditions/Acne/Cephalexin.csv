0,Cephalexin,Acne,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 22, 2021",1,"This cured my acne when nothing else did. I don't remember having any side effects, nor do I remember the dosage. It was originally prescribed for a sinus infection.",Hlynn
1,Cephalexin,Acne,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 7, 2020",3,The return of my acne happened about 2.5 months ago when I went to a trusted skin centre here in Vancouver BC.  I was advised by a friend to inquiry about ZO skincare by Dr Zein Obagi to get the perfect skin.  I spent $320 and was on my journey to amazing skin.  WRONG !!!!! My skin broke out and with vengeance.  At first I wasn’t too concerned because I thought my skin was purging.  But then it just got worse and worse where I was contemplating not leaving the house.  One day I got a horrible abscess on my cheek and had to go to the hospital to have it looked at.  I was prescribed Cephalexin.  Immediately in 24 hours I saw a HUGE improvement!!! I hope this keeps my skin clear as I only have a prescription for 5 days.  ,Sunny 
2,Cephalexin,Acne,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2020",8,This cephalexin clears my acne COMPLETELY when I take it. It even cleared up the seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp! It was first prescribed it for a horrible pimple inside my nose and it cleared up my entire face! A year later I was prescribed it again for a staph infection  and same wonderful results for my skin. Everyone is right about it not being a long term fix and you don’t want to take it frequently and become immune to it.,TC
3,Cephalexin,Acne,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 8, 2019",18,Keflex (cephalexin):I started taking this medication initially for an infection from a bug bite.   After three days of being on the medication I noticed all of my skin is clear and appears to be glowing and my pores have shrunk so much .  I’m in my early 30s and still suffer from acne occasionally mostly hormonal acne and this is amazing I don’t want to get off of it now. I was on doxycycline for months in my early 20s which also had similar  effect. The only side effects from this medication initially was a headache and diarrhea but that went away after one day and I’m staying on probiotics to help regulate .,Tess
4,Cephalexin,Acne,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 9, 2019",17,I was first put of cephalexin 500mg capsules twice a day for a week to treat a painful cystic acne that appeared inside my nose. After that one week it cleared my entire face! It was amazing. I haven’t seen my face that clear since I was probably 10 years old (I’m 30) the down side is it’s not a long term fix. A few months later I was prescribed it again for 2 weeks because I was breaking out again really bad all over my face. Again it cleared it right up! About a year after that I got another two week prescription. I had plenty of bad breakouts over that year without it but I didn’t want my body to become immune to it—hence the long break. I honestly was amazed at how effective this has been for me but again I emphasize that it is not a long term fix.,Addy
5,Cephalexin,Acne,8,,"August 23, 2013",27,"Keflex (cephalexin):I have been getting these painful boils under my arm since I was 15-16 years old. Now I'm 21. Like a month after I had my baby, my face broke out really, really bad. Cephalexin(Keflex) cleared it right up. I don't get boils any more.",jas jas13
6,Cephalexin,Acne,10,,"June 6, 2011",28,"Keflex (cephalexin):This was and continues to be the best, long term option for me. I had very little side effects ... slight headache at first but it went away after a few days.",Anonymous
7,Cephalexin,Acne,2,,"May 11, 2011",35,"Keflex (cephalexin):After taking doxycycline for a while, my body became resistant to it, so my dermatologist switched me to Keflex for acne. I think I had at least five bowel movements the first day. Eventually, my digestive system became somewhat regular, but then I started getting headaches on a regular basis. It cleared up my acne somewhat, but it was definitely not worth all the side effects. ",ArIckP
