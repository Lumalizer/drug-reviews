3,Clobetasol,Lichen Sclerosus,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 18, 2021",3,Made me worse. Set me on fire. Purple red and shredded my skin. I sent a photo to my MD. It was a big STOP NOW. Steroids are a bad drug in general and NOT designed for long term use. Any MD who cannot think outside the box and do something different rather than use this general go to dermatological ointment... find a new MD.,Blondie1954

10,Clobetasol,Lichen Sclerosus,10.0,,"October 27, 2013",41,"Temovate (clobetasol):BRAND TEMOVATE works; generic does not!!  From personal experience, and that of a friend (I had brand, she had generic).  I am cured, she is not.  Also, hormone replacement orally and topically of estrogen plus testosterone helped greatly with the cure.  I keep the area clean, using liquid soap plus Hibiclens.  After drying I lightly use Nystop powder.  I apply the topicals 2x daily.  I can again enjoy sex, climaxing, and also have a normal life...just like I used to have.  I had to appeal my insurance decision to get brand Temovate.",Worship Jesus
