0,Prednisone,Lichen Sclerosus,,,"September 24, 2019",0,I have Asthma - and have taken Prednisone on occasion.  It is my understanding that it can contribute to having thinner skin.  My Lichen scleroderma  to me gets worse after taking this medicine.  Its great for my Asthma but bad for the skin.  It also causes you to bruise more easily.  I wish there was something for asthma that did not involve this medication and/or steroids.,Sandi
1,Prednisone,Lichen Sclerosus,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 16, 2019",5,"Any time I am given Prednisone for my COPD flares my LS gets better, no itch, no burn, no sores.  As soon as I stop like 3 days later if that, the symptoms come back and are very bad. I wonder if my Dr will give me low daily dose to see if it stops my LS flares?",sfinch
2,Prednisone,Lichen Sclerosus,9.0,,"October 6, 2008",34,"NOTHING prescribed by my Dermotoligist has even touched this disease.  Prednisone is the first and only thing that has given me relief.  However my doctor is cautious and will only prescribe one round of use.  Once it is discontinued, the condition returns full force.",Anonymous
