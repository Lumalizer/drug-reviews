0,Triamcinolone,Lichen Sclerosus,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 1, 2021",3,"Per my doctor's prescription, I have used triamcinolone acetonide cream USP 0.025%, sparingly, as needed, to treat my vulvar lichen sclerosus successfully for 17 years. Over time I learned that I can only use the Fougera brand of this product, as multiple other similarly identified products seem to cause an allergic reaction, creating the appearance that the cream is not relieving the itching and pain symptoms. (It's a good thing that the Fougera brand was the original one provided to me by the pharmacy!)",Frankie
