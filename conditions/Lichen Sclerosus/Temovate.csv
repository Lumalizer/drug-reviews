0,Temovate,Lichen Sclerosus,10.0,,"October 27, 2013",41,"BRAND TEMOVATE works; generic does not!!  From personal experience, and that of a friend (I had brand, she had generic).  I am cured, she is not.  Also, hormone replacement orally and topically of estrogen plus testosterone helped greatly with the cure.  I keep the area clean, using liquid soap plus Hibiclens.  After drying I lightly use Nystop powder.  I apply the topicals 2x daily.  I can again enjoy sex, climaxing, and also have a normal life...just like I used to have.  I had to appeal my insurance decision to get brand Temovate.",Worship Jesus
