0,Ivermectin,Cutaneous Larva Migrans,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 9, 2021",4,I took it last night and promptly after 10 times to the toilet lost the contents of my stomach and diarrhea. I am being careful. Not eating much. And washing all the glasses I use. Wash my hands more often be too. I hate to be sick.,Joebob
1,Ivermectin,Cutaneous Larva Migrans,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 12, 2018",113,Stromectol (ivermectin):Took it for 2 days and then every 12 days for 6 weeks.  Saved my sanity.  Incredibly effective.  My doctor refused to send me to an infectious disease doctor to be treated and infectious disease doctors only take referrals so I bought it from out of the country.,Lsta
