1,Clonidine,Migraine Prevention,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 21, 2019",12,"I was given clonidine for a possible complex migraine. It was given IV in the ER. It caused extreme agitation, extreme restlessness tremors and overall BAD feelings. Lasted more than two hours. I was given two doses of Benadryl to treat reaction. But I was so scared. Never take this again. If anyone else has had this reaction please share. Yes",Sandy
2,Clonidine,Migraine Prevention,10,,"January 22, 2012",41,"Will prevent the pain of a migraine if I take it when I first get an aura.  If the pain has already set in, it will greatly decrease and shorten the duration of the migraine.  Only side effect is that it makes me feel tired, this can be helped if taken with Exedrine.  This is the only migraine reliever that's ever been effective for me.",Marissa83
3,Clonidine,Migraine Prevention,9,,"May 19, 2010",32,"Catapres (clonidine):A small dose of Catapres will stop the onset of a migraine, if taken before the pain gets really bad. It can also speed up the relief when taken with a pain-killer.",julius snoozer
4,Clonidine,Migraine Prevention,10,,"April 13, 2009",52,"Catapres (clonidine):Clonidine will prevent a migraine for me, if I take it as soon as the headache is starting, and sometimes even helps after it's under way. Of course, the drug does cause wooziness, so I have to be careful about standing up or making other sudden moves. It's very effective, and cheap. Give it a 10.",JuliusSnoozer
