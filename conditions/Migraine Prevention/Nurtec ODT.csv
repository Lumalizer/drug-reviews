0,Nurtec ODT,Migraine Prevention,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 27, 2022",0,I love this medication. It doesn’t work every time but my body has gotten too used to Sumatriptan so I have to have an alternative. I also get Botox and Aimovig. I’m now using Nurtec as a preventative so I take it every other day and have seen great results. I don’t get any nausea but I love how it doesn’t make you tired like Sumatriptan does. I highly recommend you try it if your insurance covers it.,DaPep
1,Nurtec ODT,Migraine Prevention,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 15, 2022",0,"Been taking Nurtec ODT for one month and just ordered my 2nd round from the pharmacy.  I've hadn't had any side effects and the medication doesn't seem to do anything for my headache pain, but I'm going to give it another try for a 2nd month.  Also, I take Aimovig shots, Sumatriptan and when the pain gets really bad, Percoset.  I've had the Botox injections, which did nothing for me but enriched my neurologist.",Sinbad
2,Nurtec ODT,Migraine Prevention,5,,"January 29, 2022",0,"At first , I thought this was a miracle drug, I had zero problems and interactions. I have terrible migraines and this made them go away immediately and kept them away. However, after about three weeks of taking it every other day I started having horrible heartburn. Or at least I think it was heartburn. My chest was tight and I felt just generally awful. I thought maybe I got a cold or something so I stopped taking it for a week just to make sure that wasn't what was causing it. I got better. And then I started taking it again a few days later and I have the same symptoms again. Again I'm not sure if it's just pain or indigestion so I'm going to go talk to my doctor next week. I'm just testing this here to see if anyone else is having that sort of chest pain. It feels somewhat similar to imitrex.",camilla
3,Nurtec ODT,Migraine Prevention,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 24, 2021",4,"This medicine has been AMAZING. Stopped the pain within 30 min every time....I will say I take it early on, so I'm not sure how it works if you wait til your in the throws of a massive migraine before you take it. The taste is actually pleasant, like a mint. A down side is how UNBELIEVABLY expensive it is. Insurance is difficult to cover it unless you have a valid and documented reason for not taking the much cheaper Triptans (Imitrex, etc). Fortunately I've been seeing a cardiologists and have had tons of tests proving the Triptans are a bit dangerous for me, so my insurance pays 100%. Last week the pharmacist told me current out of pocket for 8 Nurtec pills was $1036.00. It's insane, but it DOES work. Also, I had zero side effects and amazing relief.",DeeK
4,Nurtec ODT,Migraine Prevention,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 24, 2021",1,Ended up getting a rash all over about 10 days in and if I was late on a dose (by hours) the migraine symptoms would start kicking my up. Vestibular migraines.,amers
5,Nurtec ODT,Migraine Prevention,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 17, 2021",2,"I started taking Nurtec ODT the beginning of September 2021 for weekly migraines that showed up twice or three times a month. After using sumatriptan for a few month with dwindling results I decided to give Cove a try in helping with a better prescription. From my choices I decided to try Nurtec and, after its short term usage, I could tell the difference between with it and without it. My migraines dropped in number (from 14-21 days to 4-7 days) and those that I would have were rather short, only lasting for hours instead of days. The only reason I was able to receive Nurtec is because I was still on an insurance plan with my mom but after she lost her job and I found my own insurance I have been denied access to it due to its high price. After doing research I found out that one 8 pack costs over $2,000! Not being able to afford it I’m currently in the middle of deciding with new medication to take without so many side effects. There is no reason for this medicine to cost so much.",It's TOO expens
6,Nurtec ODT,Migraine Prevention,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 6, 2021",8,"Have had migraines with aura for 20 years, about 4-5/month. For the last 5 years, I have been taking topiramate daily to prevent the pain, but I still get the auras. My doctor added Nurtec last month, and it has been amazing for me. I take it every other day, preventively. Since I started taking it a month ago, ZERO auras for the first time in 20 years.",Chad
7,Nurtec ODT,Migraine Prevention,1,,"August 15, 2021",6,After 2 doses started passing bright red blood in stool and gobs of muscus with stool. It has been 1 month and still dealing with reaction. Condition just now starting to get some better. Took Nurtec odt 75 mg every 48 hours.  Took 4  doses then quit because of reaction.,Nurtec odt
8,Nurtec ODT,Migraine Prevention,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 26, 2021",7,"I have chronic atypical/complex migraine. I used to be on Ajovy and Emgality, which both helped until my body learned to attack the monoclonal antibodies. Since those both work on CGRP, I was hopeful when I heard that Nurtec did, too.The first dose was nothing short of magical. I felt better than I had in years. The second dose actually made me feel worse, strangely enough. By then, though, I realized that I was horribly allergic to it. (A week later, I still have a rash.)Three days after stopping it, I got hit with the worst rebound migraine of my life. It felt like my body had sharp pains from head to toe, and my fever spiked to 102.3. Holy cow. So, word of warning: this might have a heck of a rebound for you.",Mr. Pain
9,Nurtec ODT,Migraine Prevention,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 21, 2021",5,I’ve been taking Nurtec for a little more than a year and I’ll never go back to sumatriptan. I’ve been able to cut back on several medications and also happy that this one doesn’t cause rebound like my other meds did. I’m so thankful for this medication and how it has changed my life! I’m also thankful that my insurance covers it and it’s FREE!!!,SarahUT
