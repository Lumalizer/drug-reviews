0,Depakote,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 27, 2021",0,"I had a checkup with my neurologist to discuss migraine treatment.  I’d been taking propranolol for about 4 months and it was keeping the migraines with aura days at bay, but side effects were no good.  Doc started me on 500 mg Depakote ER and told me to taper off propranolol for the next 7 days.  I had a migraine the first day on Depakote, however, the pain associated with migraine subsided rather quickly.  After day one,  I began to notice a definite improvement in my mood, and my head was not hurting like normal.  It’s been about 30 days now and I haven’t had any other migraines, or cluster headaches.  I dare say I feel normal.  So far, this is the best I’ve felt in 5 years.  It works for me, benefits are not having cluster headaches or migraines, and normalized mood.  This is easy to use with no major side effects so far.",Wow
1,Depakote,Migraine Prevention,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 21, 2021",7,"I was using this drug for my insane migraine attacks. Before taking this medicine, I had migraine headaches with stomach ache, nausea, being sleepy, feeling extremely fatigued that I wasn't even able to get up out of bed, trouble in speaking and understanding the others, trouble in reading and writing. Started Depakote 250 once daily. Then gradually increased to 1000 daily. Worked great! I didn't have all that symptoms after being on this drug. Instead of having migraine, all day all night 7 days of week, I had like once a day for like 2 hours with mild symptoms. I was amazed by the result and it helped me so much. But I was still having migraine everyday. So my doctor prescribed Propranolol alongside Depakote. After that, I had migraine like once a week. But over time less and less migraines happened. After 2 years of being on this medicine, I quit and didn't have migraine even after quiting the drug. So I'm really amazed by the result. I didn't gain any weight. No serious side effect",Anonymous

Took about 2 weeks and I have not had a headache in over a month, and when I do have one I take 50 mg of Sumatriptan and its gone in 10 minutes. Its been a miracle for me and has changed my life!

4,Depakote,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 25, 2020",34,I was terrified to try Depakote for migraines. I tried a dozen other drugs that didn’t work or eventually lost their effectiveness so I was basically left w/ no choice. I started taking it at night and it really helped w/sleep. In about 1-2 weeks I felt like a new person. My migraines were lessoned as well as the intensity. I monitored my diet faithfully and exercised when I was in less pain.  And I never stopped praying it would continue to help me. Please don’t be as terrified as I was. At least try it...,Coco

About four years after that, found that my osteoporosis had significantly worsened.  Just a warning if you are a woman nearing menopause or past menopause, keep an eye on bone density as this drug can potentially reduce that with long-term use or high dosage.",Barb

On average I would have a migraine at least weekly sometimes more.  About 8 years ago I started on Depakote.  I went from having migraines at least monthly to 1 or 2 a year.  The last count was I hadn't had any for over 2 years. Now just  recently I started having migraines more frequently.  I have experienced some weight gain but not sure if it's the aging process or the meds.,Jim
12,Depakote,Migraine Prevention,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 1, 2018",20,"I have a migraine 4 to 6 times per week. I have tried Maxalt, OTC drugs such as Acetaminophen, Excedrin, Advil, PM meds like Advil PM, amitriptyline, and now Depakote. Depakote has done nothing at all to improve my migraines. At this point, I wonder if anything is going to ever help my migraines. All of the meds I mentioned above do not help. I'm at my wit's end. I tried Topamax too a few years ago and it made me so nauseous and didn't help my migraines. I had an MRI done, and the ENT doctor said there were no brain abnormalities seen on the MRI disc. I don't want to be a guinea pig ( hey, try this), or a medical mystery. All I want is some pain relief. Caffeine doesn't help, nor does alcohol. Does anyone have any advice? Thanks!",simkitkat66

I stopped taking the medication for two or three years before my migraines returned. I went on another regiment and again I went several years without a headache.
