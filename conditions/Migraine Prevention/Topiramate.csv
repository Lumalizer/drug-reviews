1,Topiramate,Migraine Prevention,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 30, 2022",0,"Definitely helped reduce migraines and seemed to have a positive effect on my seizures — I haven’t had one since I started in February 2020. The weight loss is a nice addition, too. However, I now have long-term memory loss and occasional slowed thinking and difficulty finding words. I wasn’t a genius before, but I definitely feel dumber now. I know now why they call it Dope-a-max. I would try something else due to that but I know the weight will come back on once I go off of it and I don’t want to mess with my migraines possibly starting back up. So I guess I’ll continue to be a skinny, migraine- and seizure-free idiot. Insert shrug emoji here, amirite?!",rf6842
2,Topiramate,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 3, 2022",0,"Topamax (topiramate):40 (F). Started taking 100mg Topamax daily (50mg morning, 50mg at night) as a migraine prevention drug when nothing else worked (I have cluster headaches, migraine with aura and have experienced seizures during attacks). Works brilliantly for me and I now get few migraine attacks (I used to suffer severely). Initial side effects included parathesia (tingling of hands/feet), soda being a bit weird (less 'bubbly') and some weight loss (2kg, or 4lb, a month). Topamax also had a very positive effect on my Bipolar Disorder! I have Bipolar 1 and it is very treatment resistant. It is often used off-label as a mood stabiliser. I did not know this until others commented how unusually 'calm' and focused I seemed. Only downside: potential kidney effects. I have had prior kidney infections & stones, but recent scans show benign cysts & tumours. Not sure if it is the Topamax use; so something to consider here.",Patient_XXX

4,Topiramate,Migraine Prevention,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 3, 2022",2,"I have been on this drug for severe migraines since I was thirteen. I used to praise it as the thing that saved me, however all I knew was that my headaches were going away, and I was having less migraines. The first year on the drug started with numbness in my fingertips and the zygomatic area of my face (cheekbones) as well as my calf. Mid way through the first year, my appetite disappeared for a few months, I had no desire to eat— one of the strangest feelings I’ve ever had. Eventually, the numbness side effect went away and I forgot about Topamax side effects for a year. Then at 15 years old I developed terrible dry eye, later diagnosed as inflammation. At 18 that eye is significantly blurrier. I cannot stay awake on this medication, nor to this day comprehend what people are saying or form coherent thoughts at the height of brain fog. I’ve started another medication to counteract the effects of this drug. Hear me out!!",lost youth

It wasn't very effective for me, so I discontinued.I haven't experienced any bad side effects. I remember I was very reluctant to try this at first. Instead I haven't felt anything at all. Only at 200 mg I started perceiving little ""lights"" in my field of vision, mostly peripheral. But it wasn't a deal breaker -- if this was effective I would have stayed on it despite this minor visual disturbance.I don't know if this is relevant, but after trying several medications within several classes of drugs, I noticed that I seem to tolerate antiepilectics very well, while with antidepressants I get very bad adverse reactions.",Eah
7,Topiramate,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 9, 2022",1,"Okay listen. Topiramate IS NOT INTENTIONALLY MADE FOR MIGRAINES. It is not. Doctors should never put mentally stable people on this drug. I have BPD, Bipolar 1 and many other illnesses, and I happen to get chronic headaches. Topiramate, helps people with mental issues and seizures. It has helped me with the leveling of manic and depressive episodes as well as my migraines. If you're reading this, on topiramate, and not mentally ill, get off it. Your brains chemistry is FINE. If you take this drug, you might mess up  your levels up and cause damage. so, take it from someone who needs this drug, if you have any harmful side effects (which just by the way, I've never encountered any) it's not worth it.

Anyway I haven't died and unbelievably my migraines with I have had since 2010 have VANISHED.

I'm totally normal as I was before, VERY rarely do my hands and feet tingle and sometimes I feel slightly out of body as if I'm watching myself from above ( morbid eh? ) but in all seriousness I can't believe how well this medicine has worked.

Then went up to 50mg, I had three weeks migraine free at this dose and thought it was an absolute miracle.  After three weeks my migraine returned my doctor then put me up to 100mg. I stayed there for 3 months and absolutely nothing. My migraines were actually the worst they have ever been in my life. Not only that, not long after starting this drug I slipped into a deep depression. I have never had any trouble with my mental health in my life. After getting to 100mg I then became suicidal, it wasn't obvious at first but in the end I was having suicidal thoughts all day long. I knew this was a side effect of this drug but thought that once It started working for my migraines I would feel better. In the end it was too much and I made the decision to come off the tablets and I started to feel better. Please see a doctor if your mental health deteriorates on this medication.",Lsmith

Fast forward a year later… these laundry list of symptoms I’ve never had in my life: crippling anxiety, severe depression, numbness in my hands and feet, brain fog, inability to form sentences, emotional outbursts (followed by excessive crying), excessive urination, dry mouth, zero appetite, constant nausea, shivering when it’s normal temp, overly hot when it’s normal temp, cold sweats. I’m sure I’m forgetting quite a few more. Is having 1-3 migraines a month opposed to my regular 20-25 worth it with these side effects? ABSOLUTELY NOT. I rather have the migraines.

Still ongoing tests with the help of my neurologist who put me on Topiramate. Throughout these two years I've gone from 25mg up to 200mg which I only started a couple of weeks ago. I'm now in my early 40's and since having my teenage son I was unable to shift the weight also. Before taking the Topiramate I was 16 & a 1/2 stone & only 5ft 4inc. Today I weigh 14 stone. I do have some side effects. Tiggles in my hands and feet & my nose gets runny or blocked up. I still get the occasional headache and I'm still having problems with vision and what I call 'episodes'.

I take Imitrex (triptans) as an abortive when I get full blown attacks but I was getting so many of them it was ridiculous and I was always running out of Imitrex. Let me say that Topamax is a tricky med that can have very weird/unpleasant side effects. Please use it with caution. I'm rather shocked to be reading that some patients have been prescribed starting doses of 200 mg daily. Yikes! That's high. I was put on 25 mg for 2 weeks then 50 mg for another 2 weeks and did quite well on those doses. However, when I hit 75-100 mg, I felt sick to my stomach so I barely ate anything. I was also very tired and lethargic. I waited a while, thinking the side effects might eventually go away. Apparently sometimes they do but in my case they didn't. I still felt really yucky so I was put back on 50 mg. So far so good and with fewer migraines and some pounds lost.

It is definitely effective for me not just for migraines but for seizures, and suppressing appetite. It has also made soda and salt taste weird, and I make a lot of mistakes when I am speaking or trying to get a task done which is a little bit annoying, but I find it humorous. It’s curbing my weight gain that I couldn’t stop to save my life and starting to turn into weight loss which is a welcome effect, but the pins and needles can be pretty annoying at night. Drinking lots of water and ingesting lots of potassium works a little bit in my experience. For cognitive issues I noticed when I stopped using taurine and ashwagandha they got worse and I will be going back on those supplements.

I started Topiramate 25 Mg once a day about 6 months ago and thankfully haven't had a migraine since! I was getting the aura migraines about 5-6 times a week. I was hesitant about this medication due to some of the side effects I read. I didn't have any for the first 3 months but now some are starting to surface. My right hand has slowly been developing a tick that I can't control in my palm leading to my thumb. Each day it gets worse to the point its visibly pulsing almost 24/7 which is really annoying but I honestly would rather deal with that then get the migraines.

I stopped the medication 6 weeks ago because of the hair loss but also putting on hold additional procedures considered for dealing with the menstrual pain as there is a good probability this was also caused by the Topamax.  2 stars that I give the drug are only because of the ""bonus"" side effect of the weight loss, which was the ONLY hesitation that I had about stopping taking it, and the nominal reduction in the number of migraines I was experiencing.",mnpossum

Reaching 5000 mg a day on Tylenol which I knew was terrible for my liver but that was the only bit of relief that I got and that still didn’t help. Not to mention I was taking 3-4 Benadryl OR 4 melatonin a night to sleep and would only get 3 hours of sleep. After seeing a neurologist he put me in topomax twice daily and I have only had a small dull pain twice where each time I only took one Tylenol each time and they helped within 30 minutes.

Stuck to it as it was slightly decreasing my migraines.  Had to cancel a follow up apt with Neurologist due to an emergency and would take about a month to get back in so I was now on it for 6 weeks at the 25 mgs.  A week before my apt while at work I started stuttering really bad and just couldn't put my sentences together and was very out of it.  My supervisor took me to the ER thinking I was having a stroke.  They did both a CT scan and a brain MRI but they were clean.  I continued for another week same symptoms.  Stopped the Topamax and it has all gone away.,Number9newf

I do feel emotionally sensitive at times and do get occasional tingling in my fingers and toes if I don't eat for awhile, which the Topamax also decreases my appetite and I have lost weight on. I still have ocular migraines if I stay up too late or don't get enough sleep. If I have even a small glass of wine the evening before I will wake up with an awful migraine the next morning, so I see why they say not to drink while on the medication.

The other side effects passed quickly and my headaches have all but passed, I only have eye pain now, which I think is reminiscent of the migraine that would have been.

I started this medication when I was 21 and was so desperate to find something that would actually help my on-going migraines. Personally, the side effect symptoms FAR outweighed the benefits. I started out on 25mg a day and gradually increased to 100mg. As soon as I got on this, the side effects came rolling in. Before I knew it my memory was completely gone. In daily conversation I couldn't think of simple words, names or phrases. I knew what I wanted to say but couldn't form the words to do so. The worst of all, it really affected my grades in college. I used to have awesome memorization skills. Unfortunately I would study for hours upon hours, and still wouldn't do well as I would have ""brain fog"" during tests, etc. Another side effect I experienced was weight loss. I lost around 25 lbs., HOWEVER I don't believe all of this was ultimately from topamax. I'd definitely say it suppressed my appetite, but I really changed my eating habits and worked out daily. It helped with my first few pounds and got me motivated to do the rest. On the plus side, I saw a significant difference in the amount of migraines I received. It was a night and day difference in that aspect. However, approaching a year and a half on this medication I couldn't take it anymore and had to get off. It wasn't worth it anymore. I don't think tapering off or stopping cold turkey on this really makes a difference. My mom stopped cold turkey and I tapered off, as my doctor instructed me. I rebounded off this HORRIBLY, as did my mom. I was STARVING constantly after no longer taking it. This didn't just go away either. My body didn't feel levelled out and ""detoxed"" of this for honestly about a year after. I not only gained back all my weight I lost, but plus some. Although everyone's body reacts differently, I highly do NOT recommend taking this. Not even for those desperate for weight loss. Losing weight from a medication like this is not sustainable long term. I'm 24 now and am still affected by my choice of taking this. Topamax has ultimately ruined my memory to this day.
