0,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 1, 2022",1,"My daughter had a first Emgality dose (2 injections the first time), for a month no migraines but the side effects were terrible: unexplained panic fear, anxiety+++, weight gain",Emgality
1,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 31, 2022",3,"I understand that this drug can be life changing for some people, and as someone who hoped she was one of those people, I do not wish to take that away from anyone. I just encourage caution when trying this drug, as side effects are not properly labelled and a small percentage of people will experience life-altering side effects.I was told constipation was the only thing I needed to look out for (lol). Since my second dose (it's been two and a half months now), I have been experiencing extreme brain fog to the point of having dissociative episodes. I have also had mood swings, aura, dizziness and nausea, weight gain, intermittent cold-like symptoms, and strange cardiovascular occurrences (abnormal breathing, irregular heart rate).This medication has destroyed my life and left me unable to function. There is a lot of propaganda out there promoting CGRP drugs, but I encourage you to find an unbiased source of information on CGRP's role in the body before trying a drug that alters it.",Marissa
2,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 25, 2022",0,"I started Emgality 11/2021 with a double dose per my physicians instruction. It was fabulous starting Dec 2021. I use to get 5-8 migraines a month and I went down to 1 a month. Took my second dose mid 12/2021. Again, another great month. It wasn't until my mid 01/2022 dose that I started to see my hair fall out. By the time I suppose to take 02/2022 dose I was losing enough hair to clog my shower drain. Then I would comb out my hair and lose even more hair. I've gone to washing my hair every 3 days because the amount of hair falling out has not stopped and makes me truly scared at how much falls out!! I did not take my 03/2022 dose. I'm HOPING that the hair loss will decrease with each month that goes by. If I would have to guess, I think I've lost about a third of my hair and closing in on half my hair in the next few weeks. (Side note: I lost my hair on Depakote as well)",Samantha
3,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 23, 2022",0,"I've been a migrainer for 40 years. The past 15 years have been the worst. Light headaches on a daily basis and painful migraines that really are debilitating and threaten to appear all the time.I've also had tinnitus for a year.And now, three months ago, started  to have vertigo.My neurologist decided it was time to try a new treatment (I had been on beta blockers), thinking the vertigo may be routed in migraine.I started Emgality a month ago, with  a double injection.So far it's been a life changer. Only 1 migraine in 4 weeks, and no migraine during my periods, first time in 20 years !However,  zero effect on the vertigo.In a sense, I am happy the vertigo appeared before I started this drug, otherwise I would have thought they were related, which they aren't in my case.",Migrainer
4,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 20, 2022",0,"I can only speak for myself here but Emgality has been a wonder drug for me. It is the only thing that we found that would work for my migraines. I'm 61 and my migraines came on very suddenly when I was about 58.  My Dr. tried several other meds before the Emgality such as Nurtec, Aimovig which didn't work and had some really bad side effects for me and a couple of others. I don't remember but they didn't work and the only thing I could take and still function was ibuprofen. I was bad for my liver and kidneys taking so many I was taking  a lot day everyday, and that was the only way I could function. Otherwise my headaches would be debilitating and I couldn't do anything work drive nothing. So long story short this has worked great for me so far I have been on it now about 8 months and my headaches have disappeared. I started with the 2 dose injection 1st and I will say it burns like a mammer jammer every single time I get the shot. I will take the 1 minute of discomfort for the good effects that I get.",Tube
5,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 11, 2022",0,"I had occipital  severe neuralgia headaches for 2 years following a concussion, almost every day. I started Emgality in November 2021 and noticed an immediate improvement. I rarely have headaches now, and when I do they are generally less severe and not as long-lasting. It has made a huge difference to my sense of well-being. Minimal side effects—some slight bruising at injection site. Dosage is one injection once a month. Very easy to use.",Grateful
6,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 9, 2022",0,"I have had horrible migraines for over 20 years. I have tried a million medications, including Botox, as well as a sphenoganglion block. (Not sure how to spell that one). Nothing worked for me until my neurologist recommended Emgality. I was hesitant at first because I despised injections, but I was overwhelmed with constant pain and desperate for relief. I noticed a difference within the first two weeks and called my doctor after the first month. It was truly a miracle. I am totally migraine free. I occasionally have a mild headache but it’s gone after a couple NSAIDS. Now, I tell everyone and anyone about this medication. It has given me my life back. I am extremely grateful. Thank you!",Melilee
7,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 9, 2022",0,"I had experienced 20-25 days of moderate to severe migraines/month for 26 months prior to trying Emgality. I tried topiramate, several blood pressure and beta blocker meds, gabapentin, duloxetine, dietary restrictions, and lifestyle modifications to little avail before finally getting  insurance approval for botox injections. While those reduced pain, they did not help relieve the symptoms of nausea and dizziness. I’ve now had 5 months of Emgality. I am down to ~15 migraine days per month, with only 6-8 days being severe enough to stay in bed. I do dread the injections- they feel like the kick of a mule and leave me bruised for ~10 days, but the pain is temporary and nothing compared to my migraines. My sense of taste has changed- sweetness has diminished, and chocolate tastes like dirt. It’s a great loss for a foodie, but having a life again makes the trade off preferable, if also regrettable.",Migraineur
8,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 4, 2022",0,"14 days of insomnia and migraine misery. BEWARE OF THIS DRUG AND NO SIDE EFFECTS - doctors lie! Since the first loading dose of Emgality, I have not slept more than 2 hours per night + WORSE MIGRAINES. It has been the worst decision and I pray this poison will wear off in 30 days (even though it stays in your system for 4-5 months!!). I never had sleep issues before this and nothing helps - I’ve tried anti anxiety meds and now Gabapentin. Doc has basically no further suggestions. Still running on 2 hours of sleep. I cannot believe my doctor recommended this drug also knowing that I want to get pregnant — I was VERY clear with him and he NEVER mentioned the externally long half-life of the drug - 27 days. This means Emgality is in your system for 4-5 months (I called to confirm with the drug company). Of course the drug company, just like my doctor claim that my insomnia is not a commonly reported side effect. BEWARE of this drug. It has caused a nightmare for me.",Insomnia!!
9,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 2, 2022",0,"This migraine medication is the worst! I was prescribe this medication and I took the injections in March 2020. The side effects from this medicine lasted for about 6 months. My Neurologist didn’t believe that my side effects were from this medicine. I have terrible ringing in the ears, severe depression and anxiety. I also experience weight loss of about 40 pounds from not having any appetite to eat for all these months (this might be good for some people looking to loose weight but the other side effects aren’t worth the weight loss). I have never experience anything like this. My neurologist just didn’t care to listen to my side effects and told me that side effects from this drug should be very minimal. I didn’t get minimal side effects. Please do your research if you are prescribe this drug. I don’t want anyone going through what I went through.",Anonymous

12,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 7, 2022",0,I took emgality for about 5 months before I just couldn’t take the side effects any longer. Not just a ‘upset stomach’ but doubled over in pain and extreme nausea to the point where one day I came very close to vomiting at work in front of coworkers. Constipation followed by stool so loose I thought I might need to wear diapers. Weight gain of about 10-15 pounds. It was horrible because it took me 4 months to figure it out before finally stopping the drug altogether. Not to mention how PAINFUL the injections were. I’m not afraid of needles and I’ve  never done self injections before but I had to psych myself up every time I did the shot. I don’t know if it was because it needed to be refrigerated (take it out 30 minutes before injection) but I did not look forward to doing them at all. I can’t even remember how well it worked because the side effects were so horrible. Sticking with sumatriptan.,UPSET STOMACH

Neuro wanted to do Botox, but I asked about injections like Aimovig or Emgality and the neuro decided to let me try Emgality. It works pretty well, cut my migraines over half.

BUT I have severe constipation, my stomach is swollen and distended (I look 6+ months pregnant).My physician is concerned I’m becoming toxic and on the verge of a ruptured colon.  I have also picked up 15 lbs in 6 months on the drug.  I wish I could continue migraine free, but these side effects are becoming unbearable.",Damselndistress
15,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 3, 2022",0,"I have a rare form of migraines in my brainstem, which causes all sorts of problems (stuttering, loss of balance, memory issues, tinnitus, all before the pain comes). I was having 14-35 migraines a month and no medication touched it before Emgality. For me, it worked and I got my life back. Symptoms, duration, and pain were all shortened or so greatly diminished that I had several almost normal days a month.I have noticed after 3 years of being on it that its effectiveness has diminished so the symptoms and duration of the migraines have increased, but nowhere near where it was when I started taking it. Others I have spoken with have noticed the same.",Josie

I'm on my 4th month and have seen dramatic improvement in my vestibular migraine symptoms. I have had a few days of poor sleep and neck/back muscle pain, but minor when offset by migraine symptom improvement. I will see how the next few months go. If the benefit isn't worth the side-effects I will try something else. But everything I've tried has a risk of side-effect.",JVF
17,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,1.0,,"February 3, 2022",0,"I did my loading dose of Emgality yesterday and am regretting it already. I took Aimovig with no issues for 4 months before my insurance stopped covering it. After my Emgality yesterday, I immediately noticed chest tightness, injection site redness/swelling/itching and blurred vision. Today I have itching everywhere on my body, swelling at the injection sites, blurred vision, depression (I suffer with depression that is controlled with medication, but thus depression compares to PPD I suffered years ago!), vertigo, tinnitus, fatigue, and brain fog. I will not continue this medication and have reported side effects to the FDA. I wish I would have done more research before taking this medication. Now I have to wait 5 months for it to leave my system. How are these side effects not mentioned on the website or in the pamphlet boxed with the injection?! I would not recommend this medication to anyone. I would rather deal with daily migraines than deal with all of these side effects.",HGmamax2
18,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 27, 2022",0,"I have been on Emgality for a year now and its a 180 life changer. I had a concussion when I was 1 year old and so my whole life I've suffered with chronic migraines.  I'd miss school, throw up from them, blurry vision, and extreme pain at least 3 days a week, my whole life I am now 26 and have been migraine free for a year now. I have had occasional small headaches about once a month but nothing a little Exedrin won't fix. I highly recommend this prescription. The only thing negative would because my insurance wouldn't cover unless I saw a neurologist and have had a list of at least 5 prescription meds that failed to work, so it can be a process to get it, and if your insurance don't cover the med is $600 a shot, which is ridiculous. I'm just glad I have insurance.",Sarahgrace303
19,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 22, 2022",1,"I was asked to try this medication to see if it may help with pain, I think, because I only get a few migraines a monthAfter the initial loading dose of two cartridges my weight went up by 15lbs rapidly. To add insult to it all I started having extreme Joint pain and knee swelling.The variables to add was I had been between covid infections. Maybe that weighed in. I'm not going to be negative on the product; it might work for someone else very well. But being obese to start with and that extra 15 lbs stressed the knee. If you are already heavy, I might want to do my homework. I had but found it difficult to find precise information. I wish the company didn't flood the Google search.  I might have been able to make a more informed decision if I had been able to pull up differing opinions. I couldn't find the negatives till it was too late",Ma Barker

I suffered from chronic migraines every other weekend that could last up to 72 hours. I was on triptans but it only dulled the pain and did not prevent it. I am now on Emgality. I was formerly on Aimovig but had to switch for insurance purposes. I am now FREE of migraines and headaches. It has worked wonders for me. Yes I do have constipation and I feel like its harder to lose weight, so it is a tradeoff that I am willing to take! I hope it helps others.",Lexi

In November of 2020 I took two injections of Emgality for chronic migraine that I've suffered with for over 8 years. The past three months have been very difficult for me and the only new thing I've done was taken the injection. My symptoms started a few days after Emgality. I am not anti-science, or conspiratorial. I work in biotech and am pro science and pro vaccine. The past few months I've had horrible vertigo, panic attacks, depression and anxiety. The constant dizziness and panic was COMPLETELY new for me. I'm missing work and my relationships are suffering.

I immediately had poor sleep - feeling hot while sleeping, drenching night sweats and insomnia.  During the day, the headaches were milder, but I still had to take relpax, which isn't great given Emgality seems to predispose to strokes.    I noticed when I drank small amounts of alcohol over the holidays , the sleep is even worse;  on top of the symptoms above, I wake up with a headache, nausea, anxiety and buzzing in my head.

28,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 5, 2021",3,"The injections are easily the most painful injection I have had. It’s not the needle, but the injection itself. I’d still prefer a painful injection once a month over living with massive migraines that last days at a time and cluster headaches almost every day. Since starting the injections I no longer even have regular headaches. I have had no other side effects which is also fantastic. My only other negative thing to say about the injection is it’s not skinny people friendly. It’s supposed to be sub-q and a lot of people do it in their stomach. I have no body fat. Not even in my thighs. So the first injection ended up IM and it was horribly painful. There’s no way to reposition the needle and go in at an angle like diabetics can do if they have minimal body fat. I have to have someone else give me the injection in my glute and even then it ends up IM sometimes.",Kjg
29,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 1, 2021",2,"Folks, if your doctor tries to tell you that an amazing medicine exists with no side effects - don't believe them. The only reason this medicine can claim to have no side effects is because it hasn't been around long enough for the FDA to compile enough data from reports to their MedWatch hotline. There is a reason why this medicine comes with pamphlet instructions on how to report any side effects to the FDA.Within 2 weeks of my first injection, I rapidly gained 10 lbs out of nowhere, with no other dietary or activity level changes. If anything, I've been more active and taking more daily walks! But this medicine caused intense and rapid weight gain, and bloating. I feel like a balloon.Also my head has actually been feeling WORSE since taking this. Much more headaches, dizziness, and balance issues.Look at other reviews and you'll see many people reporting the same. Stay away from Emgality!",Aynessa

The fatigue is severe-- I end up so drained that I lay on the floor with no energy to talk and sometimes fall asleep because I have no energy to even lift my arms.

It took another 4 months to be approved again. I've been on it 2 months now. It took 2 injections to work, and it lasts for three weeks, not all four. I have tension headaches and migraines. It reduced my migraines from 5/month (lasting 3 days on average) to 1/month (lasting 3 days on average). I still have tension headaches every day, but I think my brain has tricked me into thinking they aren't as severe. I sit at a level 8 most days, but I get some level 6.5 days now, which is AMAZING. I experience no pain with the injection, but I do have swelling, redness, and itching at the site for about three days. I feel moody, sad, irritable, and stomach pains for about 3-5 days. Seeing as I've ""failed"" multiple treatments (multiple meds, botox, holistic, diet), I am willing to deal with these side effects for the mild to moderate reduction in pain.",Jack

125,Emgality,Migraine Prevention,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 20, 2021",4,Migraine sufferer for 55 years:  chronic for 30 years (15+ per month) and additional vestibular symptoms for past 2 years.  Have tried many drugs and other treatments.  Took Dose 1 (loading dose) of Emgality in January 2020 and Dose 2 in February -- had no migraines for 40 days -- I can't remember ever being migraine-free for that many days.  Dose 3 in March and large thyroid cyst popped out on my neck 3 hours after injection.  Also began having finger-joint pain.  My neuro said to stop the Emgality--which I did.  About 3 weeks later one of my fingers swelled and looked like a sausage -- could not bend it.  Lasted for 9 days.  I have never experienced cysts or finger swelling any other time in my life so I believe these are likely Emgality side effects.  Unfortunate because I had significantly fewer migraines and those I had were less painful and more easily treatable than typical for several months.,Pey

I was super depressed (so out of character) ears ringing, and I hadn’t had a bowel movement in a week. When I went to the neurologist who said it was related to the medication and I need to stop immediately. I had  had the 3rd injection that morning. It takes months for it to get out of system. I downward spiralled into a depression unexplainable. I had a constant headache for months that would turn to migraine then back to a headache.

I tried Benadryl before the shot but still got a bad reaction and neurologist told me it’s possible I could get a bad anaphylactic reaction. So I think I will not take the Emgality anymore. Will have to take my rescue Amerge when I get a migraine and keep looking for my miracle cure one day.  I do believe the all side effects of Emgality are not well known yet and are under reported.",Patty69

By 3rd month I was not having migraines not even a headache. Occasionally I would get a migraine, maybe 1-2 per month. Started to notice hair loss about 4 months in. Joint swelling, numbness and tingling in my elbow started at month 7, went away after 5 months after specialists couldn’t tell me what was wrong. Didn’t attribute to the meds. Month 11 vertigo started. Would come and go but became debilitating. About the same time I started noticing brain fog and word finding difficulties that would just randomly come and go which were terrifying. Saw my neurologist and did an MRI; results negative. It seems all of the vertigo and brain fog symptoms are worse the week after the injection. This is month one off of the med.

There was a point in my life when I had more days with a headache than without. Sometimes, I'd lose vision in my peripheral and feel numb down the side of my face. I'd be nauseous.  Light would cause great pain. I was on drugs and vitamins to prevent. I tracked my diet and made changes. I had three levels of migraine meds with the last two being so strong I hated taking them. This was my life. Then my doctor suggested emgality. I've taken it now for 8 months. Not one migraine. I do notice that about 1 week before I need the shot I have a dull, annoying headache every day. Light sensitive sometimes then. No other symptoms.  I've talked to my doctor about stopping my other meds. Gabapentin and Topiramate.  It is wonderful for me. I'm so sorry for the others this didn't work on, but I think it's worth a try. I wish I'd been able to stop them years ago.",NICOLETTE

My dr told me to go back to injecting in my leg but we are switching to the IV version of this drug when it becomes available in February. This drug has helped me and my quality of life so much that getting an IV dose once a month is way worth it to me and fingers crossed the side effects go away. Note that I am also on an anti seizure med in combination with emgality.,Meatball84

I had at least 10-20 migraines a month. Triggered from food, weather, stress, & always the week of my menstural cycle. Twice a year I would get the ones that would last 3 days. After they would end my body would be weak & sore from the migraine. First 2 months of Emgality I had a couple of headaches. Not migraines, but a headache! 3rd month, nothing! Not even on my monthly cycle week! 4th month, I had something. Not a migraine. Not a headache. Just a feeling where my migraines use to be. It’s been 9 months, NO MIGRAINES! Only side effect, swelling in my hands and feet. The medication does start to wear off on the 4th week. That is when I get the feelings where my migraines use to be. Guys! I’m telling you! This is MY MIRACLE! After 24+ years of suffering with migraines weekly. I found a cure! Yes, I believe it has cured my migraines! Emgality is a miracle drug!",Blue

I saw UTIs and infections reported as a side effect in a medical journal, however, when I called Eli Lilly to report it and ask about it, they denied it and it is not listed in the fine print.

My doctor looked into it and found that they decided the infections people had during the clinical trials could be considered coincidental.

And that 1 only lasts a few hours then I'm back to feeling good.The not so good?  My normal blood pressure is now 160/90 and I'm constipated.  Then there's the terrible anxiety.

My waist was literally 11"" larger and nothing worked at home. The GIS in the hospital were flabbergasted because nothing was working there either.  No one put the Emgality and side effects together because they are severely under reported and it's such a new drug. Neurologists have been prescribing this like candy with no long term monitoring and patients just don't know because it's supposed to be the better drug in the new class.

It reached peak concentration 5 days after injection, and benadryl has been managing the allergic reaction. I'm not sure if it is related, but my resting heart rate has dropped from about 65 to 55 and I've also lost some weight from gastro issues since taking it.

This medicine has truly changed my life. I used to not be able to go out and have a good time because I feared the loud music would induce another migraine.
