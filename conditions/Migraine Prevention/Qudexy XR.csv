0,Qudexy XR,Migraine Prevention,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 5, 2019",9,This sucked I was on it for my migraines but I lost a lot of weight from no appetite. I had fainted all the time and it had caused me to have more headaches. I have tons of pressure behind my eyes and it caused me to get headaches so I feel like the medication just didnâ€™t help.,Blondie.abby
1,Qudexy XR,Migraine Prevention,3,,"July 1, 2017",6,"I was placed on this for Miragine prevention.  The weight loss was cool, but the resulting High Blood Pressure not cool.  So much so that I was not able to be put on birth control medication.  I am no longer on this medication and still am suffering from HBP.  I do not smoke or drink and my blood pressure was perfect before starting this medication.",Layman5150
