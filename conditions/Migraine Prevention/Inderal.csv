0,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 4, 2021",1,"It's helping me a lot, no more headaches. Even my stress and anxiety are numbed. I always wondered what drug people were on who always seemed to remain unnaturally calm and now I know! I think it makes you more fatigue tho and causes nightmares which the anti histamine I'm taking already does so together they cause severe nightmares, but the good effects outweigh the bad effects for me.",Petima
1,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 29, 2021",2,"From the age of 21, I started having about 4 migraine attacks a month. By 23, I was having about 3 migraine attacks a week! So around 15 a month. It was incredibly disabling and hard to hide. I had used up all my sick leave at work and my manager was beginning to notice. It was affecting my daily life massively and I started to get really depressed which made it worse. I have been on this medication for just over 7 months now. My neurologist told me to take 40mg a day (4 tablets). I'm not a fan of medications, especially because I don't have any high blood pressure. So I started taking only 1 tablet (10mg) every night before bed. I didn't have side effects, only mild lightheadedness 1 time and thats it. Almost immediately my migraines got less severe slowly as the months went by. After 2 months, my attacks were 70% gone in frequency. Now I am 7 months into the medication still taking 1 tablet daily and I now only have 2-3 migraines a month. They are now less severe and less frequent!!",jay
2,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 25, 2019",51,"Inderal is my Miracle medication -No migraine headache's, no tremors, no feeling's of anxiety.

3,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 10, 2019",51,Started getting severe migraines regularly at about age 27. By 35 it was debilitating and I would not have been able to hold down a job. Several bad migraines each month. Imitrex would help and I could function if I caught it early enough but sometimes would wake up with them.  Tried a lot of things and finally at about age 45 started on Inderal.  Changed my life and now practically never get them although I do think that menopause might have helped as it did for my mother.  Highly recommend this drug and just wish I had started on it earlier. My kids would have had a more fun and reliable Mom.,Dawn
4,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 14, 2018",10,Used for migraine prevention and the following morning I had the worst headache. I felt like I was up all night drinking. Took 80 mg.,Gm
5,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"November 13, 2016",18,"Migraines started at age 50. Just about every day at 3PM. They were severe, but only lasted 2 - 3 hours. My eye area, cheek and ear were always sensitive to touch. Inderol was a life saver. 10mg twice a day. Sometimes I would feel slight pain behind my eye, but never needed pain reliever. The nightmares were something else, 3 -4 times a month.  I was actually afraid I would give my husband a heart  attack  when I would wake up screaming and thrashing at night. When I hadn't felt that pain behind my eye for about a year, I gradually went off Inderol (around 60 yrs old).",Cait 28
6,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"August 7, 2016",20,I put on 40kg over the course of 12 years of this medication but I don't have migraines. The generic ones don't work at all except Derralin (can no longer get inderral in Australia) I would recommend anyone with life altering migraines to try it for 3 months. It just might be the cure you are waiting for.,woolyhead
7,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 20, 2016",10,"I'm a 61 year old man, I took Inderal LA 60mg for a year. For about 8 months it worked well, migraines would start and then go away after 5 to minutes. It caused me to gain 15 pounds even with dieting and exercise, it also causes ED but I was able to fix that with 5mg Cialis. In the last 2 months It has stopped preventing the migraines and causes problems with fatigue and at times shortness of breath, and the Cialis is no longer working (a big problem as far as I am concerned and my girlfriend too). It never stopped migraines caused by food triggers of which I have many.",mrhotel_ca

9,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"October 23, 2015",19,"I took this med once a day for 1 year. Before being prescribed this med was having migraines 25 out of 30/31 days per month. Birth control pills made the migraines worse. Could not tolerate prescription pain medication, severe vomiting. Lights and sound were not to be tolerated. Emergency Room Shots then available would not stop the migraine, still had to go to bed. Blood pressure would soar during an attack. Had to have suppositories for the vomiting. Could not keep pills down. I don't remember about weight gain; however I discontinued this medication because I developed numbness all over my body. Arms, legs, stomach, hips, private places. I worked a physical job and had many contact bruises where I didn't notice pain on item contact.",CC Carol Ann
10,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 27, 2015",30,"I can't begin to describe to you the kinds of nightmares that this medication gave me.  Believe me.  You don't want to know about them.  It DID, however, prevent a migraine that would have most certainly occurred.  (It rained one day and weather changes are my biggest trigger.)  Yes, this medicine worked for me in the sense that it prevented a migraine. BUT!!!  I would rather treat an existing migraine than have these TERRIFYING dreams every night.",copyrightamanda
11,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"January 29, 2015",47,"Have been taking for over 20 years, works good for getting less migraines and even better, helps my tremors.  However, when I switched to try the generic, it did neither.  Now my insurance wants to make me pay a fee for not being able to use the generic. A fee that equals the list price of the medicine without insurance.  I can not afford to go from 100.00 copay for a 3 month supply to 1300.00 for the same amount.",Jillzplace

13,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,7.0,,"May 29, 2014",63,"I found immense relief with Inderal, on just 10mg every morning and night....it was like a miracle as preventative and I also have found it dulls a migraine if one happens to break through, by taking an extra one.  I had been waking up with a bad headache/migraine every day, which lasted all day.  Codeine was my only vague relief in mega doses.  My only complaint is that since commencing Inderal I have gained 10kg and no dieting seems to help!  All this in only 12 months.  The other side effects have been an increase to my allergy intolerance to certain foods ie chocolate and a heightened problem with low blood sugar.  So, the doctor has just commenced me on Topamax instead 25mg every morning and night.  Will report how this compares!",Trying something else
14,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,1.0,,"January 14, 2014",49,"I have been on this at least a year on 10mg 2x a day, I've had unexplained weight gain and my headaches haven't gotten better. I've been to nutrition specialist and stepping up the exercise and tried to eat better but no matter what I do I still gain weight and my doctor's keep telling me that I'm not taking anything that would cause weight gain! Now they have doubled my dosage.",DanaLM
15,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 12, 2013",77,"I started taking Inderal to help with migraines. I still get headaches almost daily but they aren't migraine-quality and can be managed with Ibuprofen. Negatives: sleep disturbances, feet are ALWAYS freezing, and I'm experiencing frequent orthostatic hypotension. I had normal-to-low BP when starting this med so I don't think it's the right med for my body, since it lowers BP. I like not having migraines but can't exercise or live life if I'm always dizzy and weak.",Misha13
16,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 1, 2013",59,"I have been suffering of migraine-tension headaches for more than two years now. I tried paracetamol, NSAIDs all not effective, until my doctor prescribed me on beta blockers ""propranolol"" Inderal 20mg twice a day, and my headache really improved after 2-3 months.Thanks!",Rana
17,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 28, 2013",53,"I was prescribed Inderal to help with Primary Ortostatic Tremors. I did not get any relief with this medication for that condition. However. I discovered that whenever I stop taking Inderal, I end up with a migraine headache. I take 20 mg at bedtime. It makes me sleepy and gives me nightmares which continue to this day. However, the side effects are tolerable and well worth putting up with to prevent getting migraines. I highly recommend this medication for preventing migraines.",RobertaJ

19,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,9.0,,"October 4, 2011",40,"Inderal has definitely helped with my migraine prevention. I started getting migraines when I was 13. Now late 20s I am finally migraine free besides the odd one I get due to hormones or when really stressed out! I reduced to taking 40mg in the morning rather than 40mg morning and night and have found the migraines still stay away. The only side effects I've had was nightmares initially, that soon went after a couple months. I get very cold hands and feet, sometimes in warm weather my feet are still cold! I also feel slightly more tired/sleepy but its worth it compared to the regular migraines I was experiencing beforehand.",Anonymous
20,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,8.0,,"August 29, 2011",26,"I initially used Inderal to assist with ""stage fright"" for large work presentations (it lowers heart rhythm and so reduces the signs of nervousness). I noticed while taking it that I had fewer headaches and migraines, so my doctor recommended I continue with it. I have now been using a low dose of Inderal for around 4-5 years. It has reduced the frequency of migraines from around a 8-10 a year to 3-4 a year. Headaches have been reduced from several a week, to one every couple of weeks. I have experimented with reducing the dose and frequency however that has resulted in a return of migraines. The main side effect I have noticed is colder extremities (hands and feet). I assume this is due to the poorer circulation caused by Inderal.",Anonymous
21,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"April 23, 2011",36,Inderal was a miracle medicine for me. It prevented migraines with common triggers. The only migraines it was unable to prevent were those triggered by bad weather and hormones.,Kaye Waverly
22,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"January 29, 2011",26,Since I've been taking Inderal I've not had a migraine except the first year when I had 2 very light ones. I've had no side effects and have cut my dosage to 3 a week.,Anonymous

24,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,9.0,,"April 12, 2010",44,"I have had classic migraines for 25 years. For the last 15 I have been using Inderal as a preventative. For the first 10 years it reduced the number and severity of my migraines significantly from 1 or 2, 2 day long attacks to a cluster once or twice a year. Over the last few years more frequent migraine like headaches have been developing as often as 3 or 4 a fortnight (without aura or vomiting) leading me to seek new prevention options. However, I'm fearful of discontinuing Propranolol incase the more severe classic migraines return and disrupt my work even more than the headaches do. I think every migraine sufferer who can use it should give Inderal a go. I haven't had any problems with side effects in all these years.",izitjo

26,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,9.0,,"January 13, 2010",107,"My neurologist had me try many different medications for migraines including Amitriptyline, Topamax and Cymbalta.  I was not comfortable with taking medications that are meant to help individuals with seizure disorders and depression.  In addition, these medications did not stop the migraines and I experienced many side effects including nausea and decreased appetite.  Then I tried Inderal, a low dose medication used to lower blood pressure, paired with B2.  My migraines are now fewer and less severe.  I still keep Imitrex with me wherever I go to tackle a migraine but I have found that Inderal was the most successful medication that I have tried.  Just be sure to take it as recommended.  I hope that it helps other migraine sufferers.",Anonymous
27,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,9.0,,"December 31, 2009",63,"This medicine has helped my migraines significantly. I had been having 4-5 migraine attacks per week and now am down to 1 or 2 every few weeks. Some weeks I don't have any. A huge relief. I had migraines for years. Missed work, severe pain and this medicine is a huge relief. I do feel tired and sluggish and may be related to this medicine but I don't know for sure. I will take that side effect over the pain of a migraine any day.",Anonymous
28,Inderal,Migraine Prevention,7.0,,"December 24, 2009",32,I have taken Inderal now for a few months. I have noticed that my migraines are down to 2-4 a month. I was 5-6 a week. I was using the max dosage of Imitrex and still not getting any relief. Don't get me wrong. I love my Imitrex and can't live without it. Inderal has improved a lot of my headaches. At first I hated Inderal because I hated the idea of feeling slow and tired all the time. Now if I forget to take it my coworkers notice immediately! I get very agitated and nauseous when I have a headache to begin with and I slur my words. I want candies loaded with dyes and I get a manic-like hyperactive speech. I feel better now than I did in May. I still feel the migraines I don't feel their attacks.,Anonymous

I have been on a daily dosage of 2 capsules of 160 mg for about 4 years. No more migraines. I never had any side effects. It has truly given me my life back.
