1,Topamax,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 3, 2022",0,"40 (F). Started taking 100mg Topamax daily (50mg morning, 50mg at night) as a migraine prevention drug when nothing else worked (I have cluster headaches, migraine with aura and have experienced seizures during attacks). Works brilliantly for me and I now get few migraine attacks (I used to suffer severely). Initial side effects included parathesia (tingling of hands/feet), soda being a bit weird (less 'bubbly') and some weight loss (2kg, or 4lb, a month). Topamax also had a very positive effect on my Bipolar Disorder! I have Bipolar 1 and it is very treatment resistant. It is often used off-label as a mood stabiliser. I did not know this until others commented how unusually 'calm' and focused I seemed. Only downside: potential kidney effects. I have had prior kidney infections & stones, but recent scans show benign cysts & tumours. Not sure if it is the Topamax use; so something to consider here.",Patient_XXX

Initially extremely anxious as I'm not keen on any new medication due to a bad experience with Ecstasy as an experimenting teenager. I mean I was seriously anxious not just nervous, I was expecting to potentially die after taking this medicine. Anyway I haven't died and unbelievably my migraines with I have had since 2010 have VANISHED. Its truly unbelievable, the first few weeks, food and fizzy juice tasted different BUT its all back to normal now! I'm totally normal as I was before, VERY rarely do my hands and feet tingle and sometimes I feel slightly out of body as if I'm watching myself from above ( morbid eh? ) but in all seriousness I can't believe how well this medicine has worked. I haven't even got onto the condition for what I was prescribed this medicine for!

7,Topamax,Migraine Prevention,8.0,,"September 3, 2021",4,"I started taking Topamax to prevent migraines. I take Imitrex (triptans) as an abortive when I get full blown attacks but I was getting so many of them it was ridiculous and I was always running out of Imitrex. Let me say that Topamax is a tricky med that can have very weird/unpleasant side effects. Please use it with caution. I'm rather shocked to be reading that some patients have been prescribed starting doses of 200 mg daily. Yikes! That's high. I was put on 25 mg for 2 weeks then 50 mg for another 2 weeks and did quite well on those doses. However, when I hit 75-100 mg, I felt sick to my stomach so I barely ate anything. I was also very tired and lethargic. I waited a while, thinking the side effects might eventually go away. Apparently sometimes they do but in my case they didn't. I still felt really yucky so I was put back on 50 mg. So far so good and with fewer migraines and some pounds lost. Conclusion: I do horribly on the higher doses but great on the lower ones.",Dragon Baby

I wrote my doc and told her I felt as though I was going to drive off a bridge and she immediately took me off. I started monthly injections and that's been better.

Starting from the first day I took it. I also experienced tingling in my hands, but other than that the drug really worked well for me. The headaches disappeared and my head just felt much lighter. I didn't experience anything severe, nor loss of appetite, no changes in taste or concentration etc. After tapering down off of topamax; the constant headaches are back and I'm back to feeling miserable. I choose to quit because I don't like being dependent on such a potent drug and I don't want to eventually raise my dose because the drug has some scary potential side effects. Topamax is also dangerous in pregnancy and I'm worried about becoming pregnant unintentionally and having this drug in my system. But the drug itself was pretty great for me.",Antonianana

I suffered 3 migraines a week. I have had none in the 3 months @ 25mg dose. No more migraines, but I still have cervogenic headache that hopefully will be remedied by surgery.

My brain got foggy and I started dropping words or leaving sentences unfinished. I developed a skin reaction to metal and the skin peeled off under my wedding ring and where my bra clasp met my skin. The worst part was the crippling depression and anxiety. I spent hours crying. I developed such severe anxiety and insomnia that I stopped going to bed. I would just sit on the couch all night in a fog or fighting through panic attacks. I was prescribed Ativan to manage the anxiety. My GP put me on suicide watch and started to taper off the Topamax dosage. Before I was completely off, I developed an allergic reaction: my face, hands and feet swelled and I developed full body hives. I ended up in the ER where I was put on a high dose of steroids and anti-histamines.

I was so spaced out. I didn't want to eat and when I did eat I only had 4 bites once a day and I was done. I drove a semi truck while taking this medication and was so zombie like. Doctors were NOT sure which medication was causing it.

I stopped the medication 6 weeks ago because of the hair loss but also putting on hold additional procedures considered for dealing with the menstrual pain as there is a good probability this was also caused by the Topamax.  2 stars that I give the drug are only because of the ""bonus"" side effect of the weight loss, which was the ONLY hesitation that I had about stopping taking it, and the nominal reduction in the number of migraines I was experiencing.",mnpossum

Not bad ones but it's not a good sign. I will be dropping it back down to 50mg for a week or two and if they resolve I will try again to confirm if the higher dose is the issue.

I suffered with chronic daily migraine for over a decade before being placed on Topamax, and NO other drug helped. I was on beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, every medication for seizure disorders, and talk about side effects! They were horrific!

152,Topamax,Migraine Prevention,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 31, 2015",43,"I felt compelled to write a review, as I was on topamax (or should I say dopamax?!) for about 2 years. I started this medication when I was 21 and was so desperate to find something that would actually help my on-going migraines. Personally, the side effect symptoms FAR outweighed the benefits. I started out on 25mg a day and gradually increased to 100mg. As soon as I got on this, the side effects came rolling in. Before I knew it my memory was completely gone. In daily conversation I couldn't think of simple words, names or phrases. I knew what I wanted to say but couldn't form the words to do so. The worst of all, it really affected my grades in college. I used to have awesome memorization skills. Unfortunately I would study for hours upon hours, and still wouldn't do well as I would have ""brain fog"" during tests, etc. Another side effect I experienced was weight loss. I lost around 25 lbs., HOWEVER I don't believe all of this was ultimately from topamax. I'd definitely say it suppressed my appetite, but I really changed my eating habits and worked out daily. It helped with my first few pounds and got me motivated to do the rest. On the plus side, I saw a significant difference in the amount of migraines I received. It was a night and day difference in that aspect. However, approaching a year and a half on this medication I couldn't take it anymore and had to get off. It wasn't worth it anymore. I don't think tapering off or stopping cold turkey on this really makes a difference. My mom stopped cold turkey and I tapered off, as my doctor instructed me. I rebounded off this HORRIBLY, as did my mom. I was STARVING constantly after no longer taking it. This didn't just go away either. My body didn't feel levelled out and ""detoxed"" of this for honestly about a year after. I not only gained back all my weight I lost, but plus some. Although everyone's body reacts differently, I highly do NOT recommend taking this. Not even for those desperate for weight loss. Losing weight from a medication like this is not sustainable long term. I'm 24 now and am still affected by my choice of taking this. Topamax has ultimately ruined my memory to this day. I still cannot remember words or things. It changed me. Do not take this! There are other answers out there.",Marie37381

Tingling is more frequent in cold weather, but it's not bad enough to make me quit, especially not with the benefits I'm experiencing.There's been a bit of research into its use for mood disorders, which I have.
