1,Nortriptyline,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 26, 2022",0,"I had sudden onset, daily, and intense migraines that started a couple of years ago. I couldn't go to work because they'd come over me at about 10am every morning. I had severe pain and terrible auras, which affected my vision, gave me body tingling and numbness, and sometimes gave me mental confusion and aphasia/loss of speech. I was taken to emergency twice for the most severe symptoms. My doctor tried Nortriptyline at 10mg to start. It didn't work very well, so we increased it to 20mg. Within a couple of weeks, my migraines stopped completely! I would still feel migraines trying to ""break through"" (the best way I can describe it) for about a year, but I think I only had one in that first year. Now I have none at all. I experienced dry mouth for a few months, which then passed. I experience deep sleep and need to get 7-8 hours minimum or feel pretty groggy the next day. I know Nortriptyline doesn't work for everyone, but I'm so happy it worked so well for me.",Alder

3,Nortriptyline,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 25, 2021",0,"After trying many other preventatives for chronic migraine (amitriptyline, propranolol and topiramate) I was very skeptical that my new prescription of Nortriptyline would work. I started on 10mg and within days my constant daily headache completely vanished. I upped the dose to 20mg and my migraines pain had significantly reduced. I then upped the dose to 25mg and I now rarely have any head pain at all and if I do it's a very mild headache not the constant excruciating pain of migraine.  Overall very impressed.",Lna
4,Nortriptyline,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 29, 2021",1,I believe I suffered from vestibular migraines for many years.  They seemed to be much worse after I had a run with Menieres disease.   After that I spent several years just wanting to lie down in a dark room since I felt dizzy and brain fogged most of the time.   I was taking OTC pain killers daily to reduce the pain in my upper back and neck (back of head).   My ENT referred me to a Neurologist who immediately diagnosed vestibular migraines.  He started me on 25MG of nortriptyline.  I had lots of side effects initially.  So much so I wanted to stop.  I saw a Youtube video of  someone like me that said to stick with the nortriptyline as it takes time to work.  Eventually the side effects waned except for the constipation and morning groggy feeling.   After about a month I started to notice SOME improvement.   Neurologist then increased to 50MG.   Within another month I got my life back.    Every month just gets better and better.  I have been at 50MG for 7 months and still feel great.,Floridaguy

Started on nortriptyline and it made me nauseous for two weeks but then I got use to it and it made me have few migraines like half of what I use to get. However it took a good two-three months to kick in. Had to go off it however because it kept making my heart rate go up high. Coming off this medication was the worst. Nausea and vomiting for about a month due to withdrawals.,Jessievreal

7,Nortriptyline,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 30, 2021",0,"I pretty much had constant headaches until I was prescribed Nortriptyline.  I took 25mg every night and it totally eliminated my headaches.  When you have migraines, you never realize how productive you could be if they weren't there anymore, so it's a great feeling.  I got so much more done with Nortriptyline.No side effects.  An added benefit though is that I slept much better as well.",SDH

It has seriously impacted my life. I would recommend people with migraines to give it a go. Previously I was having migraines every month, from 1-4 days in a row. Maybe I’d have two in one day then another the day after and another one after that. I take it alongside propranolol but I was already taking that before, I never seen any difference with only taking propranolol .",Jane

11,Nortriptyline,Migraine Prevention,,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 15, 2021",4,"The basic problem that I started having was, every time I talk my right side of the head used to pain a lot , scalp, back of the head etc. It also aggravates upon work tension, watching computer, colds etc, but worst is when I am tense. My neurologist thought this problem was a migraine and prescribed nortryptiline which I am taking for the last 6 weeks(10mg daily). I saw some improvements some days but the pain still persists.  Initially I have ignored that because it was so weird that how can some headache come when someone talks? Did anyone had this kind of experience, I felt I am alone although my neurologist does not think so. Please share your thoughts. Thank you",Lucky

I am a college student on the Dean's list; high GPA... not now; I couldn't think, my headaches went from a 5 to a 12. I couldn't think or concentrate, I bombed exams (which I never have). The only upside was I slept well, but I took myself off (5 days now) and the withdrawal symptoms are awful and I still am having memory problems.

14,Nortriptyline,Migraine Prevention,9.0,,"October 23, 2020",9,"I have been on this medication since 2016. I used to take it in conjunction with Topamax, but recently stopped taking that in early 2019. Since being on only Nortriptyline, my migraines have been reduced and I have gained about 15 lbs. or so (Topamax caused severe loss of appetite). I still averaging about 6-8 a month, but that is so much better than what I was having previously. The only side effect that really bothers me is the dry mouth. My mouth gets insanely dry that I feel like I’m constantly reaching for my water bottle (which isn’t such a bad thing). I have been taking 30 mg at night, but just went to a different neurologist who upped my medication to 50 mg per night. Hoping my migraines become lessened. I do not feel overly exhausted when I’m at work, but I do notice that I feel very exhausted after my 9 hour work day. I also notice that lately, I have been able to fall asleep faster, but I have tons of trouble falling back asleep during the night if I happen to wake up.",ObsessedDogMom

The dry mouth I could handle, but not the hot flash- I'd feel pressure and tightness around my body then start sweating from hands and my feet. I also had insomnia from this! Could not sleep at all. Felt so awake throughout the night. Only reason why I'd end up falling asleep is because I’m so so tired. But would still wake up in the middle of the night and feel awake. On one of the days, I woke up with a headache from this med. I wish I would’ve worked for me for my headaches, because I tried so many drugs already but they never worked for me! (Tizanidine, baclofen, cyclobenzaprine). My doctor wants me to try venlafaxine next but from reading the reviews I’m discouraged..This drug also wasn’t too pricy.",Sv

I’ve been on it about 2 years and I’m not sure if my memory was this terrible before, but I’d say the pros outweigh the cons.

I feel like I have tried just about everything to get rid of these headaches that just never went away.  I finally had a referral to Neurology, where they suggested taking Nortriptyline.  I was so skeptical as everything else I had tried, failed.  After the first night of 30 mg, I saw an improvement in my headaches and continue to have great relief still today.  No more daily headaches and migraines are pretty rare now.  The main side effect I have is the dry mouth.  The effect this has had on my life has been shocking.  Because my head doesn't hurt all the time, I finally have energy and I actually want to participate in other activities.  Because of this, I am down 15 lbs!

Forget how many meds I have tried, but 10 mg nortriptyline was fine. I was having good sleep. Dry mouth. DR increased it to 20 mg. I started feeling more dizzy and nausea. Week 2, blurry vision and slurred speech. I declined more with mobility and strength. Told to go to the ER and got migraine IV. Slowly weaned off nortriptyline and thankfully no more blurry vision and slurred speech. DR never talked about these side effects and this was very frightening.",Tree
20,Nortriptyline,Migraine Prevention,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 9, 2019",36,My doctor prescribed me this tricyclic antidepressant  nortriptyline 25mg at bedtime as our second try at a migraine preventive. My previous prophylaxis was a beta blocker that I stopped due to side effects. Oddly my pulse was high when I started taking it. Luckily that ended up being temporary; it returned to normal in a few weeks. I do have a dry mouth but am fine when I'm drinking enough water and chewing gum. Dry mouth increases risk for cavities so good dental hygiene is now essential. It took a few weeks to work but I haven't had as many bad migraines while on it. I think nortriptyline has mildly helped with anxiety and sleep. My favorite thing is how affordable it is. Not having to use as much expensive sumatriptan also has helped financially.,Emily
21,Nortriptyline,Migraine Prevention,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 6, 2019",29,"I suffer with depression, social anxiety and migraines. I was prescribed Nortriptyline at just 20mg daily to reduce migraine frequency, but I noticed it seemed to make my anxiety much worse. I ploughed on because the migraines were dreadful and it did reduce their frequency and severity. I have stopped taking it after three years because I can no longer tolerate the side-effects of dry mouth, general spaceyness, difficulty finding words and speaking and heightened anxiety. These side effects disappeared completely within forty-eight hours and my anxiety is much more bearable.

24,Nortriptyline,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"June 9, 2019",89,"I’ve had migraines on and off since high school. Around my 50th birthday I started getting them every 3 to 4 weeks for over a year and a half. Over the counter meds didn’t work. The only thing that worked was an IV at the hospital. My doctor prescribed 10 mg of nortriptyline, which did nothing. It was increased to 25 mg, then finally 50 mg. It’s now been about 12 weeks since I’ve had a migraine. I had a mild headache last week due to a cold, but Tylenol took care of it. My doctor thinks my migraines are hormonal, caused by peri menopause, and plans to keep me on it for another year or two until I go through menopause.

If I get a headache it is mild and goes away quickly with a coffee and a couple of ibuprofen. My heart rate is still a bit higher than before but not too bad. I feel more confident, I can go on business trips and not worry about migraines. I’ve even had a beer and a glass of wine without problems.

On average, between four and six debilitating episodes per month. I have tried dozens of treatment modalities and many different drugs. I recently saw a headache specialist. She mentioned Nortriptyline. I was skeptical but agreed to try it, starting at 30 mg (taken at night). I kept a journal and returned a month later. I had fewer episodes but I still had some very bad days. My doctor increased the dosage from 30 mg to 40 mg and finally to 50 mg. 40mg turned out to be the appropriate dosage for me. I still get headaches but they are far less frequent. I haven't had a crushing migraine for over two weeks. This is a first in over nine years! I am hopeful now and it has drastically improved my family life and work life. My doctor also recommended taking the medication before bedtime so I wouldn't experience daytime drowsiness.

32,Nortriptyline,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 16, 2018",24,"Headaches started after enduring head trauma from an auto accident and have progressed over the last few years. The headaches were a mixed bag of tension, temporal muscle spasm, pressurization and migraine. I was prescribed Valium 2 mg prn for the temporal muscle spasms which helped until the headaches worsened to 4-7 days/week, and Advil was not working (not a fan of taking pain meds). I scheduled in with a new Neurologist who prescribed Pamelor 10 mg HS and it has helped tremendously. Only a few breakthrough headaches have occurred, however, they seemed to possibly be triggered by lack of sleep or increased stress. Bottom line is: be aware of your triggers and manage the triggers in order to avoid headaches. The only side effect I have noticed is a little dry mouth, so I try to stay hydrated. Since it is a low dose, I have not experienced dizziness or sluggish feelings. It's so great to be able to have headache-free weeks!",Shell

I wanted to stop this medicine because of water retention and weight gain, but this is the only medicine so far that can help me with my migraine headache, and also with my back pain after a spinal surgery. The pros outweigh the cons of taking this medication so I continue to use it up to now.",Tart

I started Nortriptyline in Dec 2010 and have not had one migraine since then.  Even with my job stress (nursing) no headaches. Finally at 49 I have a life.

182,Nortriptyline,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"April 22, 2011",29,I have been on Nortriptyline for 3 months now and I couldn't be happier. I have been suffering with migraines since I was 16 and I am now 31. I have been on a number of medicines for prevention but this is the first time I can say that my migraines are under control. After being on this for 2 months I missed 2 days and woke up to a horrible migraine. Since then I have been right back on and not missing any dosages. If you haven't tried this for migraines and are still suffering I highly recommend you talk to your doctor about it.,Anonymous
183,Nortriptyline,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"April 20, 2011",47,"Started taking nortriptyline for migraine prevention after 10 years of going to 6 different neurologists and taking countless medications. The first 3 weeks were great because I had gone from 2-3 days a week of migraines to not a single episode. It was very hard to deal with the daytime fatigue and this was only on a 25 mg dose, but two cups of coffee took care of that. I stopped taking it suddenly after 1.5 months due to a change in mood/angry/depressed feelings which I've never experienced, and sure enough I was in bed for 3 days with a migraine. So, I'm back on the medicine, have been almost migraine free for 3 months, the fatigue has gone away, and as long as I remember to read my ""positive thoughts/positive things in my life"" when I feel a little depressed (this medicine or at least 25mg a day hasn't helped depression) I'm fine. I'm 31 yrs old, healthy and now finally can live my life not worrying about migraines! Thank you to my neurologist for finally finding an answer to my pain and thank you nortriptyline.",Nick the migraine sufferer

My Internal Medicine physician took me off Topamax and put me on 25 mg of Nortriptyline for migraine prevention.  Almost immediately, I had relief from migraines, had clarity of mind even better than ever before, had a great attitude. I felt ""normal"" for the first time in my life.  This medication caused noticeable urinary retention, constipation and increased appetite which caused weight gain.  Due to weight gain, I was changed to Pristiq.  Migraines have returned.  I intend to ask to be put back on Nortriptyline and will have to alter diet and exercise.",birdofpeace

I was getting 3-5 migraines a week with a continuous headache for 5 months straight and through the heat of the summer.

186,Nortriptyline,Migraine Prevention,9.0,,"May 24, 2010",36,"My neurologist prescribed nortriptyline 2 years ago to help with my chronic migraines, which I'd had since I was 13 years old. I'd suffer migraines at least 4 times a week and the pain would be excruciating. I'd suffer from rebound migraines as well and it turned out that I can't take medicines like Excedrin because they actually worsen my migraines. Imitrex stopped working. Once I started Nortriptyline, I started seeing relief within the first two months. I'm on a steady 30mg and as long as I eat right, keep active and reduce stress [a big factor to how they'd start at first], I only get level 8/9 migraines 2/3 a month, usually at the start and end of my menstrual cycle, and take Treximet for them.",Adrasteia
