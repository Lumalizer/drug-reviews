0,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 9, 2021",0,"I started using Topamax and had a full body reaction so my neurologist switched to Zonegran. I have been taking 300mg for awhile and I no longer have migraines but I now have acne that I have never experienced before. It’s starting to get so bad that I’ve considered stopping this medication. Aside from the acne, it really does help with the migraines.",Ashlee
1,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 29, 2021",11,"Zonegran (zonisamide) did ease my chronic migraine but about 10 days after starting 100mg/day, I developed 'acute myopia,' which means I essentially lost my vision over the course of about 24 hours.  Thankfully my vision returned a few days after stopping the drug.  An ophthalmologist examined me and there is no long-term damage.  If you try Zonegran, please watch for changes to your vision and call your doctor immediately should you notice any changes at all.",Chris
2,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 3, 2020",10,"I woke up one day with a feeling that I was rocking in a boat, severe head pressure, and nausea. This lasted 3 months until my neurologist prescribed this medication for migraines. It made me feel like I could live my life again. I do get a little forgetful on it but it is worth it to not have my migraines and constant dizziness.",Sarah
3,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 11, 2019",12,Zonegran works great for my pain but I am so tired ALL THE TIME. I'm getting off of it soon I can't handle it anymore.,Anonymous
4,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,,,"June 9, 2018",4,I have been taking zonegran for migraines for about a month. It has helped tremendously. Unfortunately the past few days my eyes have been in so much pain. And that is causing my head to hurt. I am wondering will this side effect go away?,Anonymous
5,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 14, 2018",14,"I just turned 19 and I've seen 3 neurologists, 4 neurosurgeons, and a epileptic specialist all in the last 6 months. None of them can really tell me what’s wrong with me but Zonegran has helped a lot with the hard hitting headaches. I still get dull I can feel it headaches almost everyday but nothing compared what I used to get. I don’t get any major side effects, sometimes I slur or jumble worlds but I can recover them quickly, if I take it on an empty stomach my thought process is cloudy but nothing major. Also, I was normal weight before but I’ve lost 15 pounds since I started this medication 3 months ago.",Holly19
6,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 19, 2017",20,The medication worked well to prevent migraines. However after one month of use I developed joint pain/swelling and a rash. It was determined I had drug induced lupus and the medication was discontinued.,Meemfelds
7,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,9.0,,"February 26, 2017",36,"In the past, I had been given all types of medicines for migraine prevention and by far Zonegran has been THE BEST. I've had very few side effects that I can notice. The number of headaches that I normally have are decreased tremendously! I can really tell when I miss doses of the medication because the headaches come back full force but once I get the medicine in my system again, everything is all good! If you haven't tried Zonegran, PLEASE DO!",HeadacheFree28
8,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,9.0,,"December 8, 2016",64,"Well it all started with dizzy spells that got so bad I couldn't even stand up.  I was in the hospital for almost 24hr.  They had no idea what was wrong.  They suggested I see a neurologest ASAP.  After making the appointment to see who they suggested,  I wouldn't be able to see them for 4months.  So I reached out to my family.  They said to see a headache specialist.  That sounded crazy to me at first.  After meeting this new Doctor the same day I called him.  He put me on Topamax I believe it was called,  which I had almost every side effect from. So he decided to put me on zonegran small doses and work my way up.  This medicine is amazing.  I have no side effects at all and no more migraines for about a year now.",Tara h.
9,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 29, 2016",35,"For Migraine Prevention Ive tried amitriptyline, Imitrex, propranolol ,Fioricet & Topamax and for a while and they worked but the side effects were insane. However, the zonesamide works very well for preventing my migraines. I take 300 mg a day. Word finding and memory, I don't even know what those are anymore. However, I was living in constant pain. Nothing was working for me. This is the only thing that has done anything for me in quite some time, so do I walk around with a child like mind or not be able to get out of bed because of the pounding migraines?!?",Brittani31
10,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,8.0,,"August 21, 2016",40,"I have been taking 100 mg of Zonegran daily for about a month, and have noticed a reduction in the amount and severity of my migraines.",Migrainemiss
11,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,7.0,,"March 18, 2016",46,"I took 300mg of zonegran for nearly 2 years. It worked really well to prevent my migraines at the start--it was like a dream come true. I did experience appetite reduction and weight loss, but I put it back on after about a year. The negative side effects were extreme for me over time. First, my depression got much worse. That could have been external factors, but the time that I started taking Zonegran and the severe increase in my symptoms match. Also, after some time, I noticed my cognitive function was severely inhibited. I was in graduate school at the time and began failing classes, slurring my words when 100% sober, and unable to remember things. When I went off, my migraines returned severely, especially period and allergy migraines",BLove01
12,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 5, 2016",62,I was taking 6-8 Excedrine Migraine daily to control my headaches.  I saw a neurologist and was put on Zonegram. It took 1 month to build up to 100 mg per day. I was headache  free after 2 months and have been that way for 3 months now.  I will step down from the pills in 6 months. No side affects for me at all .,James_D
13,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,9.0,,"November 26, 2014",65,"I have been given many different diagnosis (Hemicrania continua, primary trochlear headache, Atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia) currently I have migrainous type chronic headache with Atypical Facial Pain. I was on 300 mg Topamax with a bunch of other stuff and this helped, but I couldn't add 2 2. It was like north pole magnets coming together. Now I have been on 200mg Zonisamide (Zonegran) for about 2 years and I have a 50% reduction in pain. As for cognitive impairment, I can live with the loss of spelling and reduced vocabulary. It's not that bad compared to either the pain or Topamax.",Steve_pain
14,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,7.0,,"January 12, 2014",84,"I took Topamax for a while and it worked wonders but the side effects were insane. However, the zonesamide works very well for preventing my migraines. I take 400 mg a day. Word finding and memory, I don't even know what those are anymore. However, I was living in constant pain.

15,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 25, 2012",57,I don't notice any side effects compared to some of the other anti-seizure medicines.,Anonymous
16,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,9.0,,"January 4, 2012",109,"I've been taking Zonegran for a few years now at 300mg per day. It had really gotten my headaches under control to where I would only have a headache periodically. Weight loss has been a side effect that I haven't minded. The problem is I've had significant memory and focus issues. I hardly felt competent most of the time. I have slowly weened myself down to 100mgs per day (I notified my neurologist of this because its an anti-seizure medicine so you shouldn't stop it cold turkey or it could cause a seizure). My memory has improved significantly, but the headaches have returned with a vengeance. I'm back to taking narcotics to address each debilitating headache. I used to take Topamax. It too worked beautifully, but also wiped out the memory.",Still Looking
17,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,7.0,,"November 28, 2011",48,On 50 mg and have seen a huge improvement in my migraines. Down to 5 per month.,Anonymous
18,Zonegran,Migraine Prevention,6.0,,"March 30, 2011",96,"I have used Zonegran for headaches only.  It is the only thing that seems to have lessened them somewhat, but I still have headaches and they affect me cognitively.  I'm mentally slower, have word-finding problems, my memory is bad, and my attention is terrible.  I've tried to go off it on occasion, but my headaches get absolutely awful, so I stay on it.",Zonegran User
