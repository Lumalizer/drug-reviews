I haven't had a migraine in weeks. Great medication. Thinking about trying to switch to telmisartan eventually for its other health benefits.",hintonmj

3,Olmesartan,Migraine Prevention,10,,"December 18, 2015",29,"Benicar (olmesartan):Benicar has been a ""wonder"" drug for me. It is the only BP medication that my body will tolerate.

I haven't even had any regular headaches since I began taking Benicar.",Linda Filipiak
