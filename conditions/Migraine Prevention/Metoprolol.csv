0,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,7,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 5, 2022",0,"Prescribed this medication originally for migraines. I take 200mg of Metoprolol. I suffered debilitating migraines since I was 15 years old, originally the med worked but has side effects. It helped with my anxiety disorder as well. I started getting Botox for migraines & no longer needed it. I tried quitting cold turkey, 6 months ago (my dr said it was okay), & it was awful. My blood pressure skyrocketed. I have never had heart or blood pressure problems in the past. I’m trying to figure out how to slowly come off this medication now because my migraines are now controlled with the Botox shots 3-4X a year. If you are suffering horrible migraines more than 5-6+X a month, I would recommend this medication. Keep in mind though that if you stop taking it, your migraines will likely return, so I was happy to have relief from debilitating migraines, but years later, I’m trying to come off it and it isn’t easy. Epipens don’t work on this med, can’t get allergy shots.",Works/quittingn
1,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 25, 2020",7,"I started take metoprolol 25mg ER after a heart attack.  The 25mg lowered my heart rate to where I was tired and dizzy. Now I take 1/2 (12.5 mg) pill once in the morning, feel good and have had 1 minor migraine in 3 1/2 years. Prior to the heart attack I was having bouts of migraines, a new migraine daily for 3-4 days, about once a month.",Mom
2,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,10,,"August 19, 2020",24,"I have suffered with chronic headaches and migraines for years. A month ago I had enough so I went to the doctor. I told her that it has gotten so bad that it’s nothing for me to have a headache each week sometimes lasting for 2-3 days. It started affected my work, family life and me mentally. My doctor put me on metoprolol 25mg 2x day. It has been 1 month today and I have not had a headache. I can not believe that I had suffered so long. This has been a life changer for me. I pray that it continues to work!",Tonya
3,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 28, 2020",10,I use metoprolol for migraine prevention. It helps a lot but sometimes I feel dizzy especially when getting up and while exercising. I also have a lower body temperature than average and the side effects when I started were terrible. Overall though I'm glad I started taking it as I went to having very few days where I would be migraine free to now only getting 0-3 per month (depending on weather),Anon

It has helped me tremendously. It has also lowered my BP, which only ran high occasionally, but needed to be addressed. I've had no bad side effects from the medication and I take it first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach. I hope my experience helps someone.",TinaDeeBee
5,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2020",24,"This medicine was not good for me to to take. I was prescribed it for migraine prevention but when I took it, my whole world seem to change. I literally could not function. It made me confused, dizzy and disoriented. I didn't know where I was, could even seem not to do simple things like count! I stopped taking it and it took me 3 days to get over it before my head started to feel half way normal again. I have other family members who take it, and it seems to have no side effects and they tell me it's effective but it's definitely NOT FOR ME!",Theluckychef
6,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,10,,"February 6, 2020",8,"I am very excited that metoprolol has helped me so much with migraines and headaches. I started taking it for SVT,  which it also helps tremendously. I hate trying and taking any medication but I sure am glad I did. Of course everyone is different, I tried another beta blocker and couldn't handle it.",Anonymous
7,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 6, 2019",40,"Oh my gosh metoprolol is the best solution for a migraine bar none! I take 50 mg once or twice a day and not only has it stopped the migraines completely but has lowered my blood pressure, helped me relax and sleep well but also strengthened my heart ! According to the doctor! It’s also good if you have a toothache because it calms down the blood flow and nerves in your teeth! I give it as many thumbs up as possible!",Brett
8,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 13, 2019",19,I have just started metoprolol for migraines and it seems to be working. I split a 25 mg into morning and evening.  I have had trouble sleeping and am considering taking only in morning.  The dosage is so low my blood pressure is relatively unaffected.,Lisev
9,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 27, 2018",24,"The day after I started using metoprolol I began having side effects. First it was nausea and loss of appetite, then wanting to sleep in the daytime (I never do this), no energy at all, couldn't accomplish anything, anxiety, and felt this way for 3 weeks before it dawned on me it might be the change in blood pressure meds. When I looked up side effects of this drug I knew it was not for me. I am back on Atenolol which had been discontinued manufacturing and already feeling better. Wondering how long the effects of metoprolol will be in my system. I'm glad it works for some, but for me it was like poison.",Syed

11,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 25, 2017",30,"I had a neck fusion 10 years ago from an auto accident.  Then hit my head on a cabinet and crushed my surgical site and herniated 2 more discs.  I'm much better now 10 years later but with a high stress day, I get muscle spasms in my neck and horrible headaches.  I've been sick for 3 days with neck pain and headache, with nausea.  I've been on pain pill, Tramadol, muscle relaxer, Skelaxin, and Zofran for nausea, and ice packs and heat to my neck.  Nothing working!   I took my first Metoprolol 50mg this morning and my headache is gone!  No side effects from the metoprolol.   I consider it my miracle drug.I'm a cardiac nurse and hand out metoprolol all day for cardiac conditions.  Who knew it was for migraine/headaches?!.",TimmyTam
12,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,3,,"July 12, 2017",11,"Migraines and thunderclaps for last 3 weeks, everyday except one and raging from mildly annoying to viscous thunder claps. Pain relief has had minimal effect, I haven't been to work and most days too tired to function.Dr gave metoprolol, been on it 2 days, I am still getting migraines and also a new side effect. I feel like I'm on a merry go round when I sit up or stand. My balance is so off I wanna stop the drug. Is it too early to tell if its working?",Kiwi82
13,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,3,,"November 12, 2016",9,"I've been taking Metoprolol for a couple months now and input see and difference than before I started taking it. In fact, my doctor even increased it from once a day to two pills in the morning and one at night. No change. Not even a change in pvc's, which makes for horrible anxiety, at least for me.",MyGraine
14,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,10,,"April 10, 2016",53,"No, not getting paid for this. First, I suffered from vicious migraine attacks since I was about 7. Migraine so severe that NOTHING would work. Finally in 2010 when I was 38 I needed stents to fix major coranary blockages. I never had a migraine since..and I used to have them about twice per week. Some have even lasted more than a week! I figure, after reading it MUST be the metoprolol...it's been 6 years. Migraine FREE. At the very least, you should try it and see for yourself..or continue suffering.",2%6890
15,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,9,,"January 26, 2016",40,"After trying imitrex and tylenol  and countless other medications for what seems to be hormone       related migraines.  Even if they worked for a short time the rebound effect was awful.  I have found it very difficult to get a physician to give me a one time dosage of metropolol.  One small dose cures me.  American doctors refuse to give me the prescription.  I finally had to go to another country to obtain the prescrption.I absolutely hate the American medical system.  I pay a fortune for insurance only for them to not care for me.  I am discusted by our greedy, price fixed, non caring medical system. Why can we not get rid of our awful, overpriced, ineffective medical system?  Big pharma bribes physicians with fancy coventions.",susankkkk
16,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,7,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 16, 2016",17,"I have been having daily migraines with aura for a couple of years, mostly likely triggered by too much stress at work and combination of long hours, lots of pressure and hostile environment. I was constantly under stress, with my body flooded with stress hormones, strong heart-beating etc. Metoprolol helped me a lot in reducing my stress level and adjusting to a more relaxed attitude at work. It calms you down by reducing your heart beat etc. From this perspective it was helpful for getting on a healthier path. It also helped reducing the migraines, even though they stayed. Over the longer run, you need to take higher dosage to achieve a similar effect. at some stage I had the impression the drug didn't help much any longer, so stopped.",avalokiteshwara
17,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 14, 2015",43,"46 yr old male with a stressful job as a PI Trial Attorney in Miami. Strangely enough, I began developing diagnosed migraines (w/out auras) last year. I was given Amerge for acute migraines which works fantastic (as opposed to Maxalt; more tired/ does not last as long as Amerge or work as well). I was put on Toprol 50 mg extended release 60 days ago. Simultaneously, I had moderately high blood pressure. This drug is fantastic. In 61 days, I have not had one bad migraine. I had a minor last week and once I took a half of an Amerge, it was gone immediately. I did though develop strange dreams which I have read reviews about. However, they are tolerable. With any drug, you have to weigh the benefits vs. the risks. Try it. It works!",PI Attorney in Miami
18,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,10,,"October 13, 2015",46,"I am so happy to have found a medication that prevents migraines, lowers my blood pressure and curbs anxiety. I was having 20 to 25 migraine days a month. So far I've only had two mild headaches that were easily treated with two ibuprofen. I feel like I have my life back. I highly recommend it.",Jessnov81
19,Metoprolol,Migraine Prevention,9,,"December 11, 2014",83,"Unbelievable!  I am a health and fitness professional and have tried everything including naturopathic remedies to control my migraines, high blood pressure and anxiety.  A 25 mg daily dose of Metoprolol has been life changing. I was mostly anti-medicine until I was finally talked into trying this.  I was having 10-15 severe migraines per month, causing frequent ER visits, stroke level high blood pressure and severe performance anxiety.  Immediately after beginning this medicine I have few headaches and they are rarely severe.  My blood pressure is down and my anxiety is significantly improved.  I have no problems exercising.  I had to adjust to being sleepy but it doesn't seem to affect my very active lifestyle much anymore.",Zenfit
