I have gone from having 1 migraine a week to about 1 a year thanks to Atenolol. I have had no side affects and for me the change in my lifestyle has been incredible.

3,Atenolol,Migraine Prevention,,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 21, 2019",13,"I had migraines from the age of 40 to 56 -  two or three every month.  An ergotamine med usually worked.  When I was 56, the ergotamine didn't work and I went to the ER.  My blood pressure was unusually high.  I was put on a daily dose of 150 MG of Atenolol.  That was 16 years ago.  I have had NO migraines and NO headaches of any kind in 16 years.   My heart rate is very low - 40s - 50s - but my doctor says it's no problem unless I feel really dizzy or faint.",GNIck
4,Atenolol,Migraine Prevention,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 5, 2018",6,"I’m 38 have had headaches all my life, until I was put on atenolol now they're gone. I started out on 25mg about 2 months ago and now I’m on 50mg. It’s great for headaches and it cost me $2.99  for a month supply, but I think I need to go back to the 25mg and maybe the side effects will go away. It’s a wonderful feeling to be headache free but I can do with the side effects.",Hoss

6,Atenolol,Migraine Prevention,5.0,,"April 18, 2018",6,"I was diagnosed with migraines at 16.  I have had them now for 40 years mine come in cycles I get them every day for about 3 wks maybe 2 hrs relief  a day, but then I will not get them again for about 6 wks when the cycle restarts. I was put on atenolol 100 mg in 2004 to help prevent these headaches, I can't say the atenolol has reduced the amount of headaches I get, but I do believe it has helped the severity of pain. I haven't had as many trips to the hospital. What has helped me the most is axert for migraine pain.",Brownie  (Canada)
7,Atenolol,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"November 5, 2017",12,"I was put on atenolol, 50 mg daily, 27 years ago. Prior to that I also suffered debilitating migraines almost daily for many years. The atenolol controlled the BP and, in a complete surprise, eliminated the migraines.  In the following years, my doctor switched me to a newer BP medicine and the migraines returned. When I went back to atenolol the migraines went away. Atenolol has been one of the very best things ever to happen to me in terms of health.",JChicago

I feel fortunate the my doctor was a specialist in migraines and put me on this when I was experiencing migraines every three days in college.   When I was pregnant, however, they did not know about the side effects, so my son did suffer growth restriction in utero.  He was only 5 pound at 40 weeks, and was taken by emergency c-section.  He is now 14 year old and fine.",MN user

My doctor put me on progesterone cream, and there was some improvement.  He thought that PMS was a contributing factor.  I had a cardiac arrest  when I was 38.  Nothing was found to be wrong with my heart, but I was going through an emotional crisis at the time.  The cardiologist put me on atenolol (25 mg/day; I now take 50 mg/day).  I was put on the atenolol to keep my blood pressure down and keep my heart from beating too fast in emotional situations.  The upside to all this is that I have not had but a couple of migraines in 20 years, and none since the dose was increased to 50 mg.",Aurora1

Prior to taking low-dose Atenolol, I was getting crippling migraines once a month or so that would consume 48-72 hours of my life. My doctor began prescribing Atenolol over three years ago, and I have only had three or four migraines since - all of which I was able to stop immediately with Imitrex.
