1,Benicar,Migraine Prevention,10,,"December 18, 2015",29,"Benicar has been a ""wonder"" drug for me. It is the only BP medication that my body will tolerate. I have been on this drug for 10 years. Not only has it stabilized my BP (the original reason it was prescribed for me) but I have ceased having migraine headaches. I haven't even had any regular headaches since I began taking Benicar.",Linda Filipiak
