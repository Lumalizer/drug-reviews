1,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 24, 2020",11,"For more than one  month I was suffering from migraine type headache. But the diagnosis most probably was occipital neuralgia.  All the meditations Over the counter helped but still suffering every day with severe headache. After starting lyrica 75 mg twice a day I am a new person, almost no headaches,  I am so happy. Adverse effects I noticed: dry mouth and for a few days blurred vision (a little).",H.R
2,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 21, 2019",5,"Never found out if it would work. Started at 25mg/day, made me dizzy and brain foggy with some depersonalization (all listed SEs), but tolerable. Began to get Restless Legs (which I didn't have bf, and which Lyrica is used to TREAT! Weird) Within two weeks I got a bad cough (cough producing mucus, and infections are listed side effects) which quickly turned into bronchitis. Stopped med, went back to neurologist 4 week after stopping (STILL COUGHING but improving) and he wanted me to retry, as I work with kids and might've just caught a bug from them. Restarted every second day 25mg. Dizziness, brain fog, depersonalization and RLS back with a vengeance, and by a little over a week the cough is taking a bad turn again. Coming off it I had my first visual aura ever. I have MwA, but never had a traditional visual aura before. A miracle for some, but obviously not for me.",Mich
3,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,9,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 1, 2019",10,Migraines are less frequent and less severe on pregabalin. I still have about 2 days of migraine a week but am not wiped out and recover more quickly since taking 175mg daily. I have had no side-effects at all. An added bonus is that  Pregabalin has eased my anxiety so that I feel able to make plans without worrying about getting a migraine.,Splinks
4,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 18, 2019",26,"Pregabalin is a godsend.  After years of migraines and taking every tablet under the sun I was prescribed this by my nurse practitioner, started on once daily and increased gradually to three, had to go back down to two as it made me too sleepy.  I had migraine 2 or 3 times a week and symptoms so severe they were taking over my life.  Been taking for about 6/7 years now, still get odd migraine but it really has changed my life.",MF
5,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,10,,"October 26, 2018",24,"After trying every migraine medication under the sun...which were only taken ONCE the migraine started, none of it worked. I did this for YEARS. I’ve had horrible, debilitating migraines since I was 12 (I’m now 31) a year or two ago, I heard about the off label use of lyrica in migraine prevention. And prevention is what I wanted! I was tired of taking meds only after a migraine started. I started with a low dose and slowly increased it until I found the amount that worked for me. It has helped tremendously! I take  100mg twice a day and I haven’t had one since! The medication is truly a god send in prevention of migraines. The side effects of the medication went away about a week of taking it— my body adjusted to it greatly. I HIGHLY recommend Lyrica as an off label use of the prevention of migraines. You’ll need to work with your doctor as to what dose works for you; adjusting it until you find the relief.",Ellie
6,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 18, 2018",5,I have never written a drug review in my life but thought I should with this one. I suffer with migraine and nerve damage in my legs following Chemotherapy. I was told to take only 25mg at night and build up slowly to 75mg. I only managed to take 25mg for 2 weeks before quitting. This horrible medication is great if you want to fall asleep all day and turn into a zombie because that is all it it did to me. I did have some slight relief but whilst on this medication I didn’t really care as it melted my brain. It also gave me blurry vision after a week which wasn’t nice. I am trying another drug now. It may help you but do your research as this drug has bad press,Tidds
7,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 22, 2018",5,Caused migraines once the medicine wore off. Meaning I am getting migraines everyday now until the pregabalin dulls the new migraine again except it comes back worse than the day before.,Penny
8,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 23, 2017",19,"After 20 years of worsening migraines and fibromyalgia symptoms, pregabalin has been a miracle. I have gone from suffering 2-3 debilitating migraines per week to zero migraines. Yes zero! 50mg per day was not enough so my neurologist raised the dose to 100 mg/day and that is just right. It took just over a week for the drug to kick in.  Pregabalin also helps regulate my adrenal glands and calms my Crohn's/IBS symptoms. I feel like a new person after suffering for so many years. Initial side effects were feeling stoned and wonky vision that made it hard to read. My body adjusted after a few days. I sleep deeply all night and no longer snore. Bladder gets real full as kidneys work hard to eliminate the drug. Fibromyalgia pain is 95% gone",Rikshaw
9,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 2, 2017",20,"Had migraines for years tried pitzotifen, gabapentin, sodium valporate, triptans, Co coldamol 30/500, toprimate, been on 75mg pregabalin an off the books trial using the docs words. I'm in UK, 7 weeks migraine free, I normally would have had 6 attacks in that time, works for me.  A bit of fatigue only side, I'll take that over debilitating effects of a migraine anytime.",Bluequest1w
10,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,4,,"July 30, 2017",6,"I was on this drug for many years and while in the beginning I felt it helped with both the frequency of headaches and fibromyalgia associated with ME, over time it stopped working.  On the flip side, it definitely had a negative effect on my memory.  I VERY slowly weaned myself off of it and most of my memory has returned. My insurance only paid a small part of the cost and it is very expensive.  I would not use it again.  No upside and plenty of downside.",Cyngo
11,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,10,,"June 18, 2015",54,"I have constant migraines often lasting months. First trialed Lyrica for 1 week without any effects (75mg x 2 a day). After trialling other prevention medication which had bad side effects. Trialed Lyrica 25mg twice a day and after the first week was migraine free for months. after running out, migraines returned. This is very effective, as all other migraine prevention medication has been unsuccessful.",bob_about
12,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,10,,"December 21, 2011",45,"I usually have bad migraines that knock me out for a day or two every week. Today I had the aura, the nausea and all my senses started feeling fuzzy like they do when it's coming on. This time, the troubles went away in an hour and I was left with a minimal headache. This is on Lyrica 2x75mg daily, that I actually take for Social Anxiety Disorder/Generalized Anxiety Disorder.",HarPe
13,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,4,,"February 13, 2011",24,"I am a migraine sufferer and I was prescribed Pregabalin over a year ago for Neuropathic Nerve Pain in my foot.  Not a single migraine over this time but unfortunately and because of all the side effects, I had to come off it.  Yes, the migraines returned with a vengeance.  I have just started taking Pregabalin again, one 25mg capsule every three days as an experiment and, touch wood, I think it's helping. It's too early to tell if it will be of any permanent good as I've been borderline with the vision thing a couple of times but fingers crossed.  My Pain Management Consultant and my GP thought I was joking at first and were quite surprised.",Anonymous
14,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,9,,"February 10, 2011",47,"Lyrica (pregabalin):When I started taking Lyrica for my migraines, my ""episodes"" were less severe and lasted a shorter amount of time. I have not experienced any of the side effects. So, for me Lyrica has been a big help.",Anonymous

16,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,9,,"September 8, 2009",51,"Lyrica (pregabalin):Tremendous reduction in pain.  I have been on the medication since May and have gone from bone shattering pain at the bridge of my nose and between my eyes 24X7 to only two or three bad headaches a week.  I have just had my dose increased to knock even those out, I'll let you know how much better I feel in four months.  I would have given it a 10 if it wasn't for the weight gain.",Anonymous
17,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,10,,"September 16, 2008",54,Lyrica (pregabalin):This has worked wonderfully to prevent my migraines.  I went from having them 3 times a week to maybe once a month.,REDHEAD79416
18,Pregabalin,Migraine Prevention,7,,"May 10, 2008",74,"Lyrica (pregabalin):I have tried several medications for Migraines and started Lyrica three months ago. Other than the weight gain I am very happy. Lyrica makes me feel ravenously hungry all the time. Actually, this past doctors appointment I was also prescribed Meridia and have experienced a loss in appetite and I hope this will get me back to a more comfortable weight.",Anonymous
