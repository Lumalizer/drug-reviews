After two weeks I started getting severe anxiety.  I thought I was dying of every cancer under the sun. No-one could convince me otherwise.

All other medications had failed to keep me pain free.  After a week on 10mg I felt like all the nerve elements of the pain had gone but on 20mg I am pain free.    The side effects are mostly positive for me.  It has quietened down my bladder.  I sleep all night ( and don’t have to wake to pee).  I haven’t noticed a dry mouth.  I do have to take them about 6pm and with food, to prevent morning grogginess and heart burn.  However, I have noticed more headaches and although I don't suffer from migraine, some migraine like symptoms - like sensitivity to light.  A few hours and paracetamol seem to work, but it’s surprising that this drug is meant to treat what it is causing in me.

The first day was awful I felt like I was a zombie but each day got better, the side effects eased and no headache! The only lasting side effects I've had is a dry mouth and constipation, minor things in comparison to the headache, I now drink more water. My doctor has suggested I come off amitriptyline to see if the headache has passed.Overall my experience has been positive, don't be worried by the initial side effects. You will feel more yourself after a couple of days, I'd recommend you take before 8pm to avoid any initial drowsiness. It works for headaches and is such a low dose.",ALB

Since starting Amitriptyline at 25mg a day my migraines have more than halved, and the ones I get are less severe. I only get one or two a month now, which is unbelievably better. I feel like I have my life back. My mood is so much better because I'm not in pain anymore, and am able to go out with friends, and have a social life again.

They were not horrific headaches but they were that throbbing annoying ache and lasted from 3 hours to all day. It affected my mood because I was always having dull pain. I started amitriptyline and had to up the dose once. I now get 1-2 headaches every two months. I've been on it for years now so it has lasted long term as well.

This was a very effective short-term medication for me.  I had more energy, lower depression and received fewer serious migraines and the ones I did get did not feel as intense.  But, after about two months I started developing all sorts of strange side effects.. One of the more notable side effects I developed was ""neuropathy"" I had constant feeling of pins and needles all over my body.  Then came the light headed effect. For some reason my intrusive thoughts and overall light headedness started to get worse. Some days I felt like I was in an ascending airplane and my ears were about to pop.  Then, I stopped for a month and started on a lower dose.  This time I got additional side effects.  Specifically, urination.  I would go 20-25 times a day and had constant feeling of bladder being full. Finally I quit for good.. The headaches/migraines came back with a vengeance unlike I've ever seen before..",Anonymous
14,Amitriptyline,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 16, 2021",5,"I have had episodic migraines for about 30 years that became chronic just after menopause.  I very rarely had a day without pain and was averaging about 15 severe headache days a month.  I did not respond well to CGRP inhibitors as they caused severe constipation.  I tried topamax, gabapentin, and many supplements.  Nortriptyline made me feel very dizzy which is part of migraine so something I really wanted to avoid.  I about lost hope when my doctor had me try, as a last resort, amitriptyline.  I have been taking 20mg for about 2 months now and have gone from 15 headache days a month to about 6, and they are not severe.  In fact I often feel a migraine coming on and it does not evolve so I don't even need to take my rescue meds.  Side effects are dry mouth in the morning, and I'm a little more tired than I used to be but it is a fair price to pay to have so many pain free days.

Very occasionally I can feel when a migraine is trying to get through but only because I know the signs so well, and then it just goes away. I have no pain and no nausea whatsoever! It’s also massively reduced the stiff neck and shoulder pain I was living with. Only side effects have been slight constipation (easily solved with extra fruit and veg) and it stopped my bladder from being overactive and always having to go for a wee in the middle of the night, which was a good thing. It hasn’t had a sedating effect on me at all, although I’ve been sleeping better when I do go to bed. It’s just win win win! So happy.",Yellowblankety

18,Amitriptyline,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 3, 2021",24,"I have had migraine with visual aura for years. Then about 5 years ago the dizziness set in too. Diagnosed with migraine associated vertigo. Always felt dizzy, off balance, like walking on a boat. My vision was always off like living in a dream state. Then I started amitriptylne 10mg. It has helped me tremendously. I was so nervous about starting it from reading all the side effects, but I had no side effects only benefits. My vision became clearer. The dizziness improved so much. Of course I will still have occasional dizziness like before my period sometimes, but nothing like what it was. I also increased to 15mg because I started having night time panic attacks, and at 15mg those have significantly improved as well. It knocks me out within half hour of taking it, and even if I wake up in panic, I'm too sleepy to worry about it and just fall back asleep.  I have been on it for about 1 year and a half.

19,Amitriptyline,Migraine Prevention,5.0,,"March 29, 2021",10,"I've had migraines pretty much my entire life. Started when I was 17 and I'm now 40. I've tried so many meds for them but nothing works for very long, including this one. Amitriptyline helps for a month or so and then is pretty useless. Each dose increase follows the same pattern, a month or so of less frequent migraines, then constant migraines again. I get migraines for 2-3 days, one day off then migraine on the opposite side. Typically starts on my left side for a few days then after 1 day of relief it hits the right side. I can predict when it will stop when it changes sides. I average 3 or more migraines a month, each one lasting 2-4 days so I literally have more migraine days than no migraine days. Not to mention after it finally quits I'm exhausted so it takes another day to recoup. Imitrex isn't much help either, within a few weeks of using it I reach the max dose for a 24 hr period without relief.",MigraineSucks

After 20 days straight I went to see a neurologist who put me on amitriptyline.  Once I hit 30mg the headaches stopped for two months. Now the pain has been back for four days.

22,Amitriptyline,Migraine Prevention,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 5, 2021",1,"After 10 years on propanolol my Neurologist recommended Amitriptyline when migraines seemed to start getting worse. I had high hopes since it is touted for chronic Tension Type Headaches. My migraines have always had those characteristics. Started on 10 mg slowly went up to 30mg found no change at all bar sleeping very well at night/more. Didn't improve my migraines at all. When went to 40mg the migraines starting coming more and every other day had some form of one, Dropped down and tried again at 50mg when GP thought should try again 3 days of migraines, Weaning off it now, gave it a good go nearly 3 months. seems there's plenty of other things to try but would go back on Propranolol as was still doing better than Amitriptyline.

23,Amitriptyline,Migraine Prevention,9.0,,"March 3, 2021",6,"This stuff stops my migraines right in their tracks... for about 3 months. Add an extra 10mg and they disappear once again for, you guessed it, roughly a few months. Totally worth it but fast forward a couple years and it's 75mg/night. Though I can't really complain; I get zero side effects (not even the infamous weight gain). I hoped there'd be a 'ceiling' dose of migraine-free eternity... but nope. Given its brought some normality to my mental health I've not ditched it. I take it in tandem with sertraline and I'm reasonably anxiety and depression-free nowadays. Whether the migraines would be worse or more frequent without it (after that ~3 month honeymoon) is impossible to say but I've found a diclofenac with a paracetamol is a great abortive otherwise - because the triptans just don't work for me. Your experience may vary - I'm sure some probably do get sustained relief from it - and I'm notorious for having medications ""poop out"" it seems.",anon

27,Amitriptyline,Migraine Prevention,2.0,,"January 27, 2021",2,"I was given amitriptyline for migraine prevention and because the doctor believed it might also help with my insomnia. It helped with the migraines but caused one insane side effect that might have been related to my insomnia, or on its own. I had horrible sleep paralysis and night terrors almost every night while on this medication. While I was in the middle of it, I didn’t see a connection as it was not a listed side effect. I became dangerously sleep deprived, often staying awake for days terrified to sleep and because I would wake immediately from ridiculously vivid night terrors more terrifying than anything I’ve ever seen in a horror movie.If you are taking this medication and having the same side effect, stop taking it.

Even when taking the pills at 8pm, I had such bad day time fatigue that became worse over time to the point where I couldn’t walk up the stairs without sitting down and I was sleeping around 14 hours a night while still feeling tired all day. I was hesitant to come off the medication because of how much it helped my migraines. This fatigue eventually became a huge obstacle for my college courses and full time job, as I’m only 22.

Immediately I saw benefits but had to double my daily dose to 50 mgs for it to be really effective.

I finally had an over the phone appointment with my doctor who said they were tension headaches. She prescribed these amitript to prevent them. I had no idea that they were also used for anxiety or depression. I have had both for years but refused to treat them as all of the SSRI’s I’ve tried made me feel terrible. I was nervous to try this for that exact reason but I was desperate for headache relief. The first couple days I felt a little out of it but that went away. Until one day I was outside throwing a ball around with my daughter and realized that I was actually enjoying my life for once in a long time. I sleep so well on these (even though that’s never really been an issue for me) and I just feel like I can enjoy things again instead of just waiting for activities to be over with.

I could not process it at all.I have since been bumped up to 20mg daily, and I things have improved even further. I am able to spend afternoons and evenings with friends and family without reaching for pain killers. I am not as afraid of committing to plans in fear of an inevitable migraine.

Amitriptyline did stop my daily dizziness, and I did feel less foggy, however, the antidepressant component to this medication does not work well for me, I was having intrusive thoughts, and nightmares, scary stuff, similar to the shining! It made my anxiety worse, I know they say there is an adjustment phase of a few weeks on this type of medication, but when you feel so bad 3 days in, you do wonder how bad does it have to get. I stopped taking the medication because of the effects it was having, but it did work. The only other small side effect I had was dry mouth which was nothing.

At first it seemed to be making things worse, the side effects the first week were horrific, headaches, confusion, brain fog, anxiety. But around week 2-3 started to feel some improvement and has continued slow but steady improvement since then.Last time I took it was a few years ago for about a year and a half eventually weaned off of it and was fine for awhile, but then the migraines came back. Have seen some studies where amitriptyline has been shown to increase neurogenesis in the brain so it helps to rebuild and rewire the brain. Hopefully will be able to wean off of it again in time.

Migraines lessened but Amitript flakes out so I'm at 60mg following many dose bump ups, still no major side effects. Occasional hypersomnia. Otherwise I'd say both take the edge off what I take them for. Amitriptyline does lose its sedative effect fast but I still think it helps sleep architecture. Migraines; still suffer mildly (stress). Peripheral neuropathy is a tough one; it may have helped lessen discomfort albeit symptoms are still prevalent. I think the two have helped through tough times. Neither is a cure but they've worked better than stuff I've tried prior.

When I got the most recent pain, the doctors were quick to call it a migraine. I felt like my head would explode, and I had none of the other side effects attributed to migraines. My doctor instead now calls it ""severe head pain"". I had it every other day for about a month. I actually called ""911"" at one point because I thought I was dying the pain was so horrible. When I was first given elavil I was skeptical since it was touted as an ""anit-depressant"". I took it, and the first three days I actually had to take naps because it made me so sleepy. On the fourth day I realized that although I still felt a little sleepy, I was now officially four days head pain free. It has been a Godsend.",Sunshinedaisy

I was put on a self-titrating dose of amitripyline by my GP and at around 50-60mg daily I was getting no migraines. However, I found that several weeks after finding my 'correct' dose, I was finding myself in constant anhedonia and ennui. I'm now off the amitriptyline, and my migraines have returned, but my mood is back to normal.",Greyhawthorn

One day I went to an Emergicare Clinic with one of my migraines(which would last days) and he did give me the injection for immediate relief, but then told me about Amitriptyline. It took about 3 weeks for me to feel that this drug actually controlled my migraines, and helped me to sleep. I am now 51 and I have not had a migraine is 10 years. Thank you...",Lakotan
