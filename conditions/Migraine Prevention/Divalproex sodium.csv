I have had almost 100% success with it. I can drink coffee, red wine, eat feta, msg, dark chocolate… all the things that used to give me debilitating migraines are now safe for me to consume. Highly recommend. Bit of a brain fog as a side effect, but not terrible.",Emd_
1,Divalproex sodium,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 27, 2021",0,"Depakote (divalproex sodium):I had a checkup with my neurologist to discuss migraine treatment.  I’d been taking propranolol for about 4 months and it was keeping the migraines with aura days at bay, but side effects were no good.  Doc started me on 500 mg Depakote ER and told me to taper off propranolol for the next 7 days.  I had a migraine the first day on Depakote, however, the pain associated with migraine subsided rather quickly.  After day one,  I began to notice a definite improvement in my mood, and my head was not hurting like normal.  It’s been about 30 days now and I haven’t had any other migraines, or cluster headaches.  I dare say I feel normal.  So far, this is the best I’ve felt in 5 years.  It works for me, benefits are not having cluster headaches or migraines, and normalized mood.  This is easy to use with no major side effects so far.",Wow

Before taking this medicine, I had migraine headaches with stomach ache, nausea, being sleepy, feeling extremely fatigued that I wasn't even able to get up out of bed, trouble in speaking and understanding the others, trouble in reading and writing. Started Depakote 250 once daily. Then gradually increased to 1000 daily. Worked great! I didn't have all that symptoms after being on this drug. Instead of having migraine, all day all night 7 days of week, I had like once a day for like 2 hours with mild symptoms. I was amazed by the result and it helped me so much. But I was still having migraine everyday. So my doctor prescribed Propranolol alongside Depakote. After that, I had migraine like once a week. But over time less and less migraines happened. After 2 years of being on this medicine, I quit and didn't have migraine even after quiting the drug. So I'm really amazed by the result. I didn't gain any weight. No serious side effect",Anonymous
