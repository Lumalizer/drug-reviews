Have suffered previously with almost debilitating bouts of anxiety and intense headaches made worse by stress. Propranolol has been a lifeline to me.

I always wondered what drug people were on who always seemed to remain unnaturally calm and now I know!

7,Propranolol,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 29, 2021",2,"Inderal (propranolol):From the age of 21, I started having about 4 migraine attacks a month. By 23, I was having about 3 migraine attacks a week! So around 15 a month. It was incredibly disabling and hard to hide. I had used up all my sick leave at work and my manager was beginning to notice. It was affecting my daily life massively and I started to get really depressed which made it worse. I have been on this medication for just over 7 months now. My neurologist told me to take 40mg a day (4 tablets). I'm not a fan of medications, especially because I don't have any high blood pressure. So I started taking only 1 tablet (10mg) every night before bed. I didn't have side effects, only mild lightheadedness 1 time and thats it. Almost immediately my migraines got less severe slowly as the months went by. After 2 months, my attacks were 70% gone in frequency. Now I am 7 months into the medication still taking 1 tablet daily and I now only have 2-3 migraines a month. They are now less severe and less frequent!!",jay

What is the point when it is impossible to feel anything other than tension and depression 24/7 IDK, but yes my life with extreme headaches is even worse now on this.

It was scary. I went to emergency they said it was vertigo. Dr recommend MRI for brain. It was clear. After a month it came back again with same intensity. I went to ENT to check if its kind of vertigo and Dr said he didn't find anything. One family friend was neurologist when I consult with him he said that its basilar migraine and asked me to take propranolol 40 mg twice a day, so  a total 80 mg. It has been 4 months now that I  am migraine free. Thank goodness I have never felt dizzy since then. In starting it I had weird dreams but now I sleep without weird dreams. The only problem is that when I walk I feel like my chest is burning and I breath heavy but I understand that I have to face it. People with migraine should consult with their dr to take it.

I got taking high doses 10 years ago when I started with 80mg and was always tired, dizzy, weight gain, fluid accumulation in my feet, nightmares, insomnia, dry eyes, dry mouth, dehydration, hair loss/thinning, e.t.c., wasn't worth it until I read a reviewer mentioned low dose.",Colozt

I take 2.5 mg of naratriptan (Amerge) for acute headaches and that usually helps (once in a while I'll have to take a second naratriptan but one usually knocks it out).

I tried birth control pills continuously without a break, Imitrex, Maxalt, Amerge, Excedrin migraine, many recommended vitamins, Preventa Migraine Herbs and nothing worked on a regular basis.  Blood pressure spiked up very high about 2 years ago.  Decided to try Propranolol and it has worked for anxiety, migraine and blood pressure amazingly!  However I have all the side effects - constipation, sometimes depressed, nighttime hallucinations, severe weight gain without change in diet or exercise (25 pounds in less than 2 years), lack of energy, sensitivity to exertion, bloating/water retention, etc.",Sienna
26,Propranolol,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"December 24, 2019",76,"I've taken this drug  propranolol  for close to 2 years for chronic migraines & it's just as good, if not better than Topamax, Gabapentin, Aimovig, and Amitriptyline. I've tried every possible migraine preventative & this medication makes it possible for me to function. Without it, I experience daily headaches & full blown migraines with vomiting, light & sound sensitivity, inability to talk. Very few, if any side effects. Highly recommend it if you don't want something as high risk as Topamax but as effective. It also helps with my anxiety greatly by reducing my heart rate & feels like the racing heart beat isn't nearly as intense during anxiety attacks. HUGE thumbs up.

They lasted three days, complete with light/sound sensitivity and nausea. I would frequently have 4+ migraines a month, especially if I was under a lot of stress. A month in, I have not had a single migraine. I've had some pressure in those typical (for me) migraine areas, and even some slight light sensitivity, but no pain. So, my body is TRYING to have migraines and can't. I'll take it.I haven't noticed any major side effects, though I will say, if I miss my morning dose I can tell come afternoon. I feel sweaty and my heart gets sort of fluttery, like I'm having a severe bout of anxiety, which is not fun.I think I'm also benefiting from the anxiety applications of this medication.

By 35 it was debilitating and I would not have been able to hold down a job. Several bad migraines each month. Imitrex would help and I could function if I caught it early enough but sometimes would wake up with them.  Tried a lot of things and finally at about age 45 started on Inderal.  Changed my life and now practically never get them although I do think that menopause might have helped as it did for my mother.  Highly recommend this drug and just wish I had started on it earlier.

33,Propranolol,Migraine Prevention,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 8, 2019",22,I was on propranolol for about 3 months to prevent migraines. It dis not help me at all. It gave me wild vidid dreams. I would even wake up and see things like a spirit swooping down at me and I would lay there blinking and scared thinking what is going on I'm awake! I dreamed of dead people that have been gone for years - this part was soo enjoyable. The medicine did not help but I liked seeing past loved ones. That was ok those dreams were never scary. What made me stop taking it was a nightmare of being shown I could go along if I would only get ready! I looked and it was a body bag. I woke up scared so bad and did not want to sleep again! I quit taking it after that. I naturally have low blood pressure and acid reflux. The only medicine I was on with propranolol was for acid reflux.,dragonan

I've always been consistent with going to the gym, but I've put quite a lot of weight on recently - partly because it's a side effect, but also because I've had no motivation or energy to get to the gym. I'm also cold ALL the time. Especially my hands. People in my office have the air-con on and I'm sitting here in a big jumper, shivering.

Since being on them I've felt so cold all the time and having terrible trouble sleeping.  I seem to be in a foul mood and feeling depressed. After 2 weeks I even got a migraine. I then missed 2 doses over 2 days. I took them mornings. By the 2nd evening I felt shocking. My heart was beating so fast and then missing beats. My blood pressure went up high. I felt dizzy and out of breath.  I'm seeing the dr tomorrow to see how to come off them safely. I've been researching and it seems very dangerous to just stop them. It seems you have to ween off of them. Please research before taking them.,Cazzy72
