0,Lisinopril,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 14, 2021",0,"Have been a migraine suffer for my entire life. I haven't had a week without 3-4 migraines for as far back as I can remember. Since the start of 2021, I have had a migraine every day when I woke up and sometimes the migraine would wake me up. My quality of life was terrible. When I didn't have a full blown migraine where the back of my neck was so bad and my left eye felt like someone was turning a hot poker in it, I was scared to death that I would get one. My go to medicine was Imetrex, but the side effects were terrible and was taking everyday almost which of course is 3 times the recommended dosage in a month. I felt horrible and always had a migraine, was nauseous, throwing up or not able to function. My personal and work life suffered. Was about to give up until one day I went to the doctor and got on 10mg of lisinopril for high blood pressure. I have been taking it for 3 weeks and have not had 1 migraine since. This is the longest I have gone without a migraine in 30 years. I have my life back",Happy Again!!!

Until, that is,  I started on Lisinopril for high blood pressure. It has completely eradicated my migraines.

4,Lisinopril,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 31, 2019",31,"I have had migraines most of my adult life. Got one almost always before my period and random times during the month. They settled down at 48 when I hit menopause. Then they came back with a vengeance after an endometrial cancer diagnosis, hysterectomy and hormone treatment. During this trying time my blood pressure went sky high. Dr. prescribed Lisinopril/HCTZ 10/12.5 mg and I haven't had a migraine in the three months I've been on it! Blood pressure is totally under control and I am just so happy to be rid of the migraines.",Happy166
5,Lisinopril,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"October 7, 2019",22,I have suffered from migraines for my entire life. I’ve tried several medications. Relpax was my migraine medication that my insurance didn’t want to cover. I had elevated BP due to being overweight and started lisinopril and have since had minimal migraines! I now have lower BP but have no plans to come off of this medication as I enjoy not having migraines anymore!,Sally
6,Lisinopril,Migraine Prevention,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 25, 2018",11,My Migraines have gone from 6 to 10 a year to 1 to 2 every 5 years since taking Lisinipril. I also have noticed that if I start to get the aura before a migraine and take 2 Lisinipril during the aura phase. I only get a small headache that is easily controlled with Tylonal,T
7,Lisinopril,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"November 15, 2018",16,Since I started having slightly high blood pressure a few years ago my doctor put me on lisinopril. I was also having severe migraines and she told me that the tablets would help decrease them. Miraculously they worked and apart from the odd headache I was fine. I stopped taking them when my pressure seemed stable (it's never worryingly very high anyway) and sure enough my migraines returned. My blood pressure was normal so I was put on different types of medicines with all the most negative side effects under the sun to try to keep the migraines at bay but they didn't help other than make me groggy and sick. I asked my doc to put me back on the lisinopril when my pressure went back up (slightly) and the migraines disappeared!!!! I don't know if my migraines are connected to my slightly high blood pressure or if it's the lisinopril that keeps them away but I will never ever stop taking it again.,Nija

9,Lisinopril,Migraine Prevention,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 23, 2017",12,"I am a long-time sufferer of severe migraines, which interfere with my life. I take propanolol as preventative and Relpax for breakthough  4-6 times a month. My PCP prescribed small dose of Iisinipril in addition to help. No idea if drug would have helped migraines. First week, I had small outbreaks of hives I did not connect with lisinipril. Then I had an outbreak that within a day covered my entire body (there were plate sized hives that overlapped, with smaller outbreaks on top. My mouth and throat began swelling, and I got to ER asap. Very close to anaphylaxis. Learned that this is known side effect of Lisinipril. Package warning is not clear enough.",OhDarn

11,Lisinopril,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 19, 2016",25,"I had headaches since around middle school several times a week.  Never had a doctor who thought much about them, so I just stayed quiet and lived with them.  No over-the-counter medication helped.  I woke up with them.  I developed high blood pressure and my doctor prescribed lisinopril 10 mg.  Soon I realized I was no longer having any headaches -- zero.  I'm so happy we stumbled upon this.  I have told my doctor how much it has helped my headaches so that she remembers it for the next patient who might have constant headaches with no relief.",CLRN

13,Lisinopril,Migraine Prevention,,,"July 2, 2016",17,"Some years back my doctor started me on Lisinopril and like a lot of you, my migraines were gone.  The problem now is they've returned with a vengeance.What I'm wondering is, since these are generic, was it possible that it came down to the manufacture of Lisinopril.  So too those of you that are headache free, make note of the company that is making it and if you wouldn't mind, share the company name.",mikebinmontana

I started Lisinopril 10mg for mildly elevated blood pressure 2 months ago and haven't taken either Imitrex or Excedrine since.  Very happy with the results.  I haven't experienced the cough that some have, so for me this has been a great experience.",DerekB
15,Lisinopril,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"April 19, 2015",47,"I've had severe headaches/migraines about twice a month since I was about seven years old. As an adult, my headaches were brutal: 36 hours of feeling like I'd been shot in the left eye, and NOTHING helped.  I always had low-to-normal blood pressure until it jumped up post-menopause despite my being thin, active, a non-smoker, etc. The hypertension meds I tried either made my headaches worse or made me so tired I could barely get out of bed. Lisinopril also made me tired, but to a degree that I figured I could live with. A few months later, I realized I hadn't had a headache since I'd started taking it. Fifteen months later I am still migraine-free. Unbelievable!",Adelthea17
16,Lisinopril,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"January 27, 2015",58,I had high blood pressure that turned out to be related to the job. My doctor put me on a low dose of linosipril and the blood pressure came down.  And my migraines stopped. I did not make the connection until I left the job and we took me off of the linosipril. The blood pressure was normal but the migraines were back.  I did a search for  migraine medications and found linisopril on the list. I went right back to the doctor who was  going to put me on Topamax and shared my findings. Two months on a low dosage of linisopril and no migraines. Woo hoo! Fingers are crossed and so far so good.  Best of all it is a free prescription at my local grocery store pharmacy. What a tremendous relief after years of having migraines run my life.,Nanoo

18,Lisinopril,Migraine Prevention,9.0,,"December 15, 2014",43,"My doctor prescribed lisinopril for my blood pressure. She is an osteopath and very much into prevention. I'm not even sure my blood pressure is high. I've gone a few weeks without it and when I do my re check at the doc is 120/70. That happened a few times. But my point is, it really helped with my hormonal headaches. Now I'm period free and totally migraine free for 5 years. So hopefully you hormone migraine sufferers will have the same luck. It does give me that little annoying dry cough, but I'd say it's worth it.",It's me B
19,Lisinopril,Migraine Prevention,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 5, 2014",25,I'm 35 and never experienced migraines before. I started taking 10mg of lisinopril and 200mg of Toprol XL as a result of heart failure. Now once or twice a month I get aura migraines.  It seems backwards since both can be used to treat migraines.  Not sure if it's connected but I will be asking at my next check up.,leebowski

Down to 5 migraines per year. (Used to be 100/yr). With such a wonderful outcome we have tried to wean me off the meds 2 times. BAD IDEA. I'll probably be on these for next 30 years.

21,Lisinopril,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"February 27, 2014",39,All I can say is my doctor prescribed it because a few of his patients with high blood pressure reported their migraines had disappeared when they started lisinopril .

I have had migraine headaches from childhood which have only increased in frequency and severity with age. (Violently ill & lasting 3 days) My doctors have tried every type of medication with very minimal results. In questioning 3 family members who are on Blood Pressure medicines, (all of whom have ceased having migraines), I found they are all on an ACE Inhibitor.  I requested a trial of Lisinopril even though my blood pressure is normal.  My doctor agreed to a 5mg/day trial, although she admitted she would have never thought to try this but for my research.  Six months later, had no migraines. Only a few ""chinook"" (weather-related) mild headaches, easily treated with Tylenol or Advil. So Thankful!",PLP

26,Lisinopril,Migraine Prevention,,,"December 19, 2009",47,"Doctor put me on 10 MG for high blood pressure and my horrible nightly migraines that I have had for 20 years stopped immediately!  I could not believe it. The doctor didn't mention this possibility, only the cough, which I have a touch of and will put up with. I just googled the drug and found the migraine effect on my own after 2 days of no headache. It has only been 10 days so I am keeping my fingers crossed, but so far I am stunned! I have Zomig for the migraines but it was usually an hour or so process in the middle of the night to get it to kick in. I cannot believe how much more rested I feel, not having to be up in pain every night. Sure hope it is effective on my blood pressure too.",VAXE
