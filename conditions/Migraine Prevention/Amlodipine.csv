1,Amlodipine,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 12, 2021",1,I suffered from migraines from about the age of 20 until this year - 2021.   They were horrendous and wiped out days. I’m 72 now and was prescribed Amlopidine just by chance for high blood pressure. Well!  After about two weeks I noticed I wasn’t having the usual two or three migraines a week. I couldn’t believe it at first. As so it’s carried on. My life has changed. I feel free.

4,Amlodipine,Migraine Prevention,9.0,,"January 25, 2021",7,"I suffered from chronic headaches below and above my eyes. It had gotten worse over the years. Never had any specific pattern. Was being affected 3-4 times a week. Intensity was sporadic, nausea, not being able to live life normally. All you do is want to sleep until it goes away. Taking pain pills way too much...I had high blood pressure that was getting worse as well every year. My doctor put me on amlodipine 5mg daily for this. Headaches were gone. Every now and then I feel them come on but never to the intensity as before. I was recommended so may other drugs to cure my headaches but no one ever mentioned amlodipine. This drug also helped lower my blood pressure (was 150/100 and now 130/90 avg. I was told blood pressure does not cause headaches generally (unless very high). So maybe something else the amlodipine is doing to the blood vessels to alleviate the headaches.",Chronic Headaches
5,Amlodipine,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"January 9, 2021",19,Had migraine since I was 19 and now 45. Would get at least 1 a week that was manageable but very few weeks one that was horrendous and every 6 months 1 that would leave me stuck In bed all day wiped out and all my nervous system was on edge. Felt like my senses were all over the place not even able to focus on opening a door handle. Started taking Amlodipine 8 weeks ago and realised today I’ve not had a single migraine.  No visual disturbances or other aura issues either.  Minimal occasional headache that goes away without any need for pain relievers. Glad that this medication has another effect. I suspected this would be the case as it widens the blood vessels and one of my consultants suggested my migraines were caused when the blood vessels contract causing the Migraine.,Peter

23,Amlodipine,Migraine Prevention,8.0,,"December 29, 2016",26,"Prescribed for BP but also nearly eliminated migraines. I started having migraines 13 years ago and high BP 1 year ago. My first BP prescription was 5-10mg amlodipine daily. It lowered my BP and *almost* more importantly nearly eliminated all migraines (from previous 2-3 per month to a few for the year of which none were severe enough to require real migraine medications). I believe amlodipine has also expanded and intensified whatever fatigue I might normally experience, but *for me* that is an acceptable tradeoff (yes, fatigue can be limiting, but migraines are limiting and excruciatingly painful). I can see where a person taking amlodipine only for BP might be unhappy with the side effects, but the migraines are far far worse.",David66

It prevents me from severe pain in the base of my skull (perhaps occipital neuralgia). The important point to be noted in my case is the timing of taking the medicine. I mostly get the pains in early morning while in deep sleep. Before taking this med, I would wake up in severe pain that would last until I take a painkiller. Than I started taking amlodipine 5mg at night. However, I need to take the medicine about 10~12 hours before the onset of the pain. If I am late, I would get the pain on the same time in morning in spite of taking the pill. However, in such case, the pain gradually diminishes as the time approaches to the required time.

Whenever I was very tired and feeling very sleepy before going to bed in the night, I woke up in the mid night due to severe pain in the base of the skull.
