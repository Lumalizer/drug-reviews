0,Norvasc,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 3, 2020",5,"First used Norvasc for just hypertension, but it prevented the most of migraines as well. 5mg did the job for me. I can use less NSAID than before.",031
1,Norvasc,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 10, 2020",20,"Have been taking Norvasc 5mg (started with 2.5 mg but had to go to 5mg) since 1997/98 to prevent migraines . My internist at the time had read about it being used to prevent Migraines so he had me try it! WHAT a relief! I don’t get migraines any longer and rarely have even mild headaches! I tried to stop it once to see if I still needed it........not a good idea! Got back on it! Also, discovered generic isn’t affective on me so have to use brand Norvasc.",Coco
2,Norvasc,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"September 20, 2016",52,"I had no idea my physician prescribed this to me for migraines. I was initially prescribed this for hypertension. I also have migraines, but since taking this, my headaches have decreased dramatically. I rarely have a migraine any more. It's been a blessing! I love this medication. It's worked wonders for my quality of life.",MzCarrieBabyyy
3,Norvasc,Migraine Prevention,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 25, 2016",27,I get migraines every day. Been taking 2.5 mg of Norvasc for about 6 months and still getting migraines everyday. Does not seem to be helping.,mom151231
4,Norvasc,Migraine Prevention,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 25, 2012",105,I started taking Norvasc after trying many other meds. including Topamax which had too many bad side effects for me. So far since starting about a month ago; I have only had 1 headache and that was at the very beginning. No side effects. I was having headaches which was affected by weather pressure; about 1 a week. So nice not to have them and to feel good on this medication.,Anonymous
5,Norvasc,Migraine Prevention,,,"April 19, 2012",95,"I was given Norvasc to replace Lisinopril after I started having constant coughing. I take it for hypertension, but I am a frequent migraine sufferer, especially due to changes in air pressure and to exercise. The first week on Norvasc, I had a migraine all day, every day. The following week, I took no migraine medication (Imitrex) or OTC meds at all - even though we had two days when I would normally have had weather-related issues, and I played tennis on another day. I did have swollen feet the first few days, but I increased my water intake and that seems to be the key for me. So far I'm very impressed with the results.",cghipp
6,Norvasc,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"September 12, 2011",109,"Norvasc was given to me to treat migraine headaches. I am 28 years old.  I was having them as frequently as every other day.  I dealt with this for five years before being prescribed Norvasc.  After two months of taking a 5mg dosage, I can say I am a new person!",Anonymous
