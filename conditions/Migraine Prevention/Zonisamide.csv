0,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,9.0,,"February 5, 2022",0,Love this medicine. Been on it since 2002 with little to no side effects. When neurologists bumped me up to 300 mg a day consistently started having some neuropathy in my feet but bumped back down to 200mg and have had no issues. This medicine gave me my life back. Went from having daily debilitating migraines to bring able to function again. Have never been able to wean off. Thankful for it!,Headacher

Aside from the acne, it really does help with the migraines.",Ashlee

3,Zonisamide,Migraine Prevention,1.0,,"April 25, 2021",1,"I took it during 5 months. At the beginning everything was great, I finally stopped having headaches all the time. Time passed and I was only getting more side effects. I could sleep 12 hours and still be sleepy, I had trouble with memory and concentration, I basically couldn’t read too many phrases because I was getting confused. It came to a point where I noticed that I had an enormous amount of anxiety, social panic, I was getting depersonalization feeling behind the cloud like I wasn’t here, like I wasn’t myself. 0 spontaneity and willingness to do anything. I decided to stop it. It can’t be helping one problem but causing so many others. I will see which other solution I can get now for my migraines cause they are starting to come back as the medicine is clearing out of my system. (tried topiramax before and it went awful after the first pill).This is to say, all the other side effects that I mentioned went away after I stopped it, so it was definitely its job.",Rose

He's starting me at 50 mg and I have noticed a decrease in severity and duration of the migraines, but not a decrease in quantity so far.  I don't have any motor side effects, but I've lost 12 lbs. so far and I can't really afford to lose any weight.  If it continues, I'll have to stop as I am now at 157 lbs as a 5'11'' man.",Rob

The first neurologist took me as far as he could on the AEDs and migraine rescues as he could.  I took Topamax, depakote, Elavil, dilantin, fromig, maxault, imitrex, you name it.

I started at 25 mg and was eventually suppose  to be on 200 mg. I never went beyond 100 mg. By week three (at 75 mg) I was so nauseous that I could rarely eat more than a bite of food. I was also an emotional wreck. I would go from being irritable to crying uncontrollably in minutes. The night I took the first 100 mg dose, I began vomiting within 30 mins. After an hour of constant vomiting, I fell asleep for 12 hours. It took days to feel better - exhausted, nauseous, depressed. My family called it  the medicine that makes you sick.

The past 6 months have been the worst so I went in, and was put on Maxalt, maxed out on it first day. Then I got Sumatripitan which works but the side effect (knocks me on my butt) are hard to deal with at work. So they put me on Topamax, absolutely loved it. 16 days no headaches, no migraines nothing. But I had an awful itch that was worsened by sunlight. So put me on nortriptyline at 50mg. I also have temporomandibular joint disorder  Disorder ( due to grinding my teeth during sleep) so after I was put on the nortriptyline the migraines would cause my  temporomandibular disorder (TMD) to flare up intensifying my migraines.

However after starting hormonal birth control, I wanted to stop it to eliminate the possibility of it decreasing the effectiveness of the BC. My neurologist recommended Zonegran since it's a similar anticonvulsant & he's had patients successful with it. 10 days after building up to my full dose (100mg nightly) I began feeling nauseous. I was lightheaded, out of breath, & had to lay down. For the following week I was nauseous & sometimes lightheaded, & missed 2 days of work. After realizing Zonegran was the only change, I began to wean off of it. The nausea was better as my dose decrease & gone after stopping.Unfortunately I can't take triptans due to the birth control since I get migraines with aura & my neurologist won't prescribe antidepressants to people already on one.
