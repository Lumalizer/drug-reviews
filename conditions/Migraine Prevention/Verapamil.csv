No joke not trying to be rude or funny. It was the last drug I started so I stopped taking and my problem went away. I could not find any reference to this side effect. Must just be me.

54,Verapamil,Migraine Prevention,,,"October 20, 2009",40,I just started on verapamil for migraines/blood pressure 2 weeks ago. I went in to the doctor with a migraine and my blood pressure was high. I can tell a difference and feel better already. After years of awful pain it is a nice relief. However I am sleeping so sound that I don't hear my husband up at night. I take the pill at bedtime. I am not able to get up to run at 4:45 am either.,jackannt

Verapamil, even in it's lowest dose, has helped to greatly reduce the frequency of my headaches and migraines. It is amazing to function all day without an aching head. It made me aware, for the first time, just how frequently I was experiencing problems. Very grateful for this medication.",Anonymous
