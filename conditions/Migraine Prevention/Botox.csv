0,Botox,Migraine Prevention,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 27, 2022",1,"After years of dealing with what I still believe to be severe tension headaches, but the doctors insist are migraines, I agreed to try Botox. The neurologist gave me 39 very painful injections. My migraines ALWAYS come from my shoulder through my neck and behind my left eye. I wake up with with the headaches. They don’t come on later in the day. I don’t have the major sound or light sensitivities. So, when I received these injections all over my face and the front of my scalp plus a few at the base of my skull, I had little hope of success. I was right. Not only did I not have success, it made things worse by somehow causing headaches to shift to the right-side of my head. The number of days with migraines increased. I know that the first round of Botox doesn’t always work, so I decided I would take a chance on a second. This was a huge mistake. I’ve run out of room right when I got to the worst  experience of my life, sorry. Please weigh your options carefully.",Julie V.
1,Botox,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 24, 2022",0,"Botox has helped my migraine pain immensely. It lowers the pain level all over my head, now I pretty much only feel pain in my forehead and temple areas, and it is less intense. I am given the maximum 200 unit dose, as I have an intractable (extremely stubborn) migraine.I find this very easy to receive and my only side effect is the inability to move my forehead much, a worthy trade.",4 year Migraine
2,Botox,Migraine Prevention,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 3, 2022",1,"I stopped being able to speak without severe difficulty and pain so my neurologist thought we could try Botox. The first treatment didn't do much but the second really seemed to help my headaches and I started speaking normally. The third round gave me more headaches but I still was speaking normally. My fourth and last round made my headaches so bad that, after 2 months they have barely resolved. I have had to take muscle relaxers just to get through the day and don't know how I didn't pass out from the walnut cracking headaches. I will not be having it again. It is wearing off finally and my voice is going away again. But I'd rather not speak then have to live in such horrible pain. It is, however, worth a try if nothing else has worked for you. Just be aware that this is a possible side effect.",Quinn
3,Botox,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 22, 2022",0,"Botox is a miracle for me. I struggled with chronic migraines for 8 years and had 1-2 migraines a week. I even had 2 migraines that were each >10 days long that landed me in the ER at 22/23 years old. Chronic migraines totally controlled my life. I tried every medication, but to no avail. I even tried a drug called Emgality a few years back, but it caused weight gain and hair loss - which are very undesirable side effects. Ever since I got approval for and started Botox, it’s been a miracle and has allowed me to live my life normally. I get Botox every three months and have been going for 2 years now. There are no negative side effects. The only thing I have noticed, and why I give this a 9/10, is because by the ~10 week mark, I get a 3-4 day long migraine that may mean that my body is signaling that it needs the Botox treatment a little earlier than the 3 month mark. Once I get my treatment, any migraine that I currently have dissipates so I can deal with that one downside.",K.A

Finally had the chance to do Botox, all shots were administered, with pain at injection sites. So excited about the opportunity since insurance did not want to cover originally, but headache turned into horrible 1 1/2 week long migraine, and it never got better, only worse: weak neck could not hold the head up, pain in the neck, given a muscle relaxant, which caused heavy dizziness, fainting. Dry mouth followed, terrible nausea, feeling close to vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, fear of what is going on. When we talked to the neurologist, were told is not from the botox, that no one ever had those reactions. Check with the gp dr! :) Her face is hot, she has to have a fan on at all times. Tinnitus sound like a fire drill going on 24/7, chills all over body and tremors. At wit's end since no pain medication seems to help, a different kind of head pain since the botox.

9,Botox,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"June 18, 2021",5,"I get very painful tingling all over my entire body and it's terrifying. I also have pretty bad headaches and speak like a stroke victim. One round and I stopped having the painful parasthesia and my headaches are better. I can also speak more clearly. The second round was fine too and it's already helping on the second day while the first took about two weeksI am having some mild side effects that may scare some patients off: the left side of my face feels a bit numb, my throat is occasionally tight (breathing and swallowing not affected), my forehead feels kinda frozen. Are these side effects worth it? Yes. I get these feelings off and on anyway without the Botox except for the frozen forehead. Anyway, I hope I can keep this up for many years and, while I seriously suggest looking into the warnings involving the use of ANY drug, I also encourage you to try Botox if you can. It's fantastic. And unlike triptans, it doesn't run the risk of cardiac problems. Good luck!",ajt123

12,Botox,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 22, 2020",12,I’ve been receiving Botox for migraines for almost 4 years now. My first neurologist was horrible and it hurt so bad. My second neurologist was AMAZING at doing botox and though it still hurt it was over quickly and she was wonderful at distracting me. Before botox I was having 2-4 migraines a week and often times they’d put me in the ER. Twice I’ve had seizures from a migraine. I’d say the botox has cut my migraines down by about 70%. It takes about a week or two to take effect. And wears off usually around week 10. But those 8-9 weeks are totally worth it. It had been a huge change for my life.,Borderlinelove

U have to go thru the CDC. And if you're not on a ventiltor at the ER then no test.  The doctors lie to us to line their pockets and we are thrown to the curb. How do they sleep at night?,Lp
14,Botox,Migraine Prevention,9.0,,"August 26, 2020",11,"I have chronic migraine with aura and without treatment I have 20+ migraines a month. I've tried a heap of other treatments and nothing has ever helped as well as botox. It usually reduces them by about half and they are less painful. Medicare in my country will pay for it every 12 weeks, however, I find that the effect wears off at around 10 weeks. I get a lot of migraines during the gap. For a week or so after treatment I still have bad migraines until it kicks in. I also get anxiety and body aches, heavy fatigue, kind of like I'm getting a flu. But after about 10 days it starts to resolve reasonably quickly and I have a much better quality of life.  For me it's worth it, even though there are a few bad weeks every 3 months. A few times I've ended up with slightly uneven eyebrows, but nothing too obvious. I wouldn't want it done by a neurologist who wasn't skilled at it though, as it won't work if it's not in the right spots and could be dangerous.",Michelle
15,Botox,Migraine Prevention,4.0,,"August 23, 2020",8,"So I received about 4 rounds of Botox for my migraines. Around after my second time getting it I noticed the front of my hair (in front of my ears) began to curl excessively. I naturally have curly hair but the roots are usually not curly/frizzy. The front section of my hair began to become kinky and VERY dry. Nothing is wrong with this type of hair but I have 2 different curl patterns on my head with a noticeable difference in patterns. I consulted multiple hair dressers and they all came up with the same thing, it must be the Botox. I have tried multiple different products, different styling techniques, and treatments but the front section of my hair is a frizzy which doesn't match the rest of my hair. My last treatment of Botox was 4 months ago and I do NOT plan on getting it again. Has this happened to any other curly girls/anyone in general? BTW it did somewhat help with my migraines but due to my hair situation I decided not to continue this.",Lulu
16,Botox,Migraine Prevention,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 18, 2020",17,Used  Botox successfully for several years now for migraines.  It cut the number of migraines I have each month in half & the ones I do have tend to be less painful & don't last as long.  It was really after the 2nd set of Botox shots that I saw real pain reduction.  The worst side effect I have is that the shots themselves give me a horrible headache.  It's not a migraine but really hurts.  For the headache caused by the Botox shots I have tried a Toradol shot (didn't work) and steroids.  Those help but they do have side effects so I try to only use them for 1 day.  I also ice the sore areas & take Tylenol.  One time my eyebrow looked a little arched (for about 2 mos) so I told the PA and she altered the placement the next time. That worked.  I also bring an ice pack to the appointment & put it on my forehead after the shots to cut down on bruising.   Shots are very much worth it for the migraine reduction they provide.,Peachk

I have a younger look about me, at least from the cheekbones up. I don’t look like I match now. The slight rise in my eyebrows makes everyone ask if I’m mad. That’s not cool that I look kinda mad.

I’ve got worsening anxiety and paranoia, nauseated, want to cry and I’m sooo not myself I just want to go to sleep and wake up feeling normal again!!! I’ve only felt the feeling of ice going thru my veins from a toxic level of an antidepressant about 20 years ago in which case a trip to the ER has to take place and that’s how I found out what that was but it was also including vomiting and diarrhea.. now I just feel like ice is going thru different veins on and off and I pretty much stay fatigued and nauseous.

I am also one of the victim (assuming the lucky one) who is 90% back to normal after 3.5 years of which the first two years I was almost disabled from the horrific side effects of 200 units for HD's.

25,Botox,Migraine Prevention,8.0,,"October 19, 2019",20,"After three treatments I’d say it has helped quite a bit. The most surprising change has been the reduction of the chronic neck pain I use to suffer. After my first treatment I had numbness and a sensation of heaviness in my scalp, neck and forehead- it wasn’t unpleasant especially considering I was use to constant pain in those areas. The one negative side effect is that I feel consistently awful for about 1-3 hours after the injections. My neuro treated me like I was crazy when I mentioned it to him. About 15 minutes after the treatment I get a slight sensation that I can’t swallow. In the next few hours I feel tired, a bit light-headed and have a fluttery- type feeling in my chest. I had my third treatment yesterday and had the same exact symptoms. It’s frustrating that the doctor - who was presumably trained by pharmaceutical companies on these drugs - won’t believe me.

I have had chronic migraine for about nine years, and I wish I had tried Botox sooner - I was hesitant to try it because of the potential side effects that I had read about, but the only one I've experienced is increased neck pain for 2-3 weeks after receiving the injections (and this pain is still much better than the frequent severe migraine episodes that I was having before).

My first set of injections were practically painless.  The sensation is similar to plucking eyebrow hairs, but nothing like getting a bikini wax! I've continued Botox every 3 months and my headaches are down to maybe 1 per month and they no longer affect my life as a busy mom.  Botox has been a miracle for me!",Anonymous

I've suffered with debilitating migraines for 25 years now and have tried every medication prescribed and OTC, unfortunately the only thing that would take away the pain are narcotics. Since using Botox treatments my migraines are under control and down to approximately 4-5 a month compared to 20-25. I feel as though I have a life again and not living hour to hour, not having a life in fear of having a migraine. Also VERY grateful to have good insurance that pays for this.",RaeRay
136,Botox,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"December 23, 2011",94,"I had a constant 24/7 headache for two years straight before trying Botox. I tried every other conceivable medication to no avail, but Botox cut my pain to a third of its previous level. I still get injections every four months or so, but it's been three years and I still have the much lower pain level, can work, and am thankful everyday for Botox.",Anonymous
137,Botox,Migraine Prevention,3.0,,"September 29, 2011",95,Have had intractable migraines for 38 yrs-just had 31 injections for migraine a month ago.  Within 3 days I began having muscle spasms in neck/shoulders 24/7.  Went back to neurologist and he gave me Lidoderm Patches (12 hrs on 12 hrs off).  They help somewhat but the adhesive breaks out my skin.  I chose to wear them during the day so I can function at work.  My head feels so heavy that my neck muscles don't feel that they can support it so I have to lie down in my car at work every few hours to relieve pressure.  Am supposed to have a 2nd round of injections in 2 months but have decided the side effects are worse than my 3-4 migraines wk.  At least I had a few days without any pain before.  ,Anon Gram
138,Botox,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"June 18, 2011",91,I've had migraines for 26  years. I've tried every migraine medication with no success. They either didn't work or the side effects were intolerable. This migraine has lasted 1 year. I received Botox injections and woke up the next morning with no pain. Finally relief with relatively little side effects. I would recommend this to anyone who has minimal relief from typical migraine medications.,Anonymous
139,Botox,Migraine Prevention,10.0,,"March 10, 2011",86,Botox is the only medicine that has stopped my migraines for 4-5 months at a time. I've had migraines for over 40 years now and I'm very happy that it is now approved by the FDA for migraine treatment.,Anonymous
