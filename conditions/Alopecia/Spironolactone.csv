0,Spironolactone,Alopecia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 27, 2022",1,"I have been taking 100mg of Spironolactone and 5mg of oral minoxidil daily for approximately 4 months to treat significant hair loss / thinning which was causing me a great deal of anxiety.  After approximately 2 months, my hair loss significantly reduced from large clumps in the shower drain to approximately 20 or so strands of hair.  Now I am noticing regrowth in my crown, covering patches which had become quite bare from the initial hair loss.  I understand that I will most likely be on this medication for life and at 45 years old I have already had my children so was not concerned about possible pregnancy implications.  I have found that I have started to get a small amount of facial hair.  But this is easily removed and when weighed against the stress I had from loosing my hair I am not concerned about this very much at all. I haven't noticed any fluctuations to my weight.",Anonymous

10,Spironolactone,Alopecia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 14, 2021",1,"I started spiro (100mg) and tactu pump about a month and a half ago. I PROMISED myself if it worked or I saw any improvement that I’d write a review. I've had those annoying skin coloured bumps all over my face since I was 10 (now 19). High school was particularly the worst and when I say no face product helped, no diet helped. I had even been refined sugar free and dairy free for years. I FINALLY gave up and made an online appointment with a derm. He suggested spiro and tactu pump so I started. I was terrified of purging with either one and was praying I wouldn’t. I maybe got slightly more little tiny bumps but absolutely nothing I wasn’t used to. The only side effect I really saw with spiro was a slight increase of peeing more. I’m now almost on my 7th week of sprio and at the current moment, my skin feels flat, no clogged pores or little bumps.  It honestly feels surreal because I haven’t had clear skin like this in 9 years. I’m PRAYING it only gets better:).",Nsjdjdjsod

The reason I got on was because of my genetic alopicia & so far, I’ve had a lot of new hairs grow, but not many where I need them to grow (a specific spot), but my acne (I’m 15) has almost completely gone away. I used to have bad back acne and a little on my cheeks, but now I get a pimple every once in a while.

15,Spironolactone,Alopecia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 28, 2021",11,"Hair started thinning dramatically about three years ago. Tried PRP, DHT-blocking shampoos, and even had to use a hair fibre to leave my house because my part was so wide. While some of those things helped, I still needed to use the hair fibres to fill in my part to feel comfortable going out. I decided to try spiro about three months ago after my dermatologist suggested it. My hair is almost completely restored. My part looks normal, my bangs aren’t perfect but look considerably better and I don’t have to wear the hair fibres anymore. I think after a few more months it will be completely back to the way it was a few years ago. It’s pretty amazing how well it worked. It did take a month to get used to it. I felt a bit anxious after starting it but I feel fine now. I’m on 50 mgs. Would definitely  recommend for hair loss. For acne, I still break out so not sure it’s helped with that just yet.",Lane

Occasional diarrhea--balance your fiber and drink a lot of water! But it's worth it because I have inch-long hairs growing on on my scalp!!!

I started taking it in October 2019 for alopecia and at 100mg it does it's job. My hair loss stopped and a lot of what I lost grew back. However, since I went up to 100mg I started having panic attacks and general anxiety, which I didn't experience before. When I lowered the dose to 50mg the anxiety disappeared, but so did my hair, so I stayed on 100mg. I also have to watch my potassium intake, if I eat too much of it I get arrhythmia. I still recommend to try it if you suffer under hair loss and if nothing else worked for you. It is a life long commitment though.",Cat

My alopecia stopped after about 3 months, and my hair started to grow back. Added bonus: decreased appetite and weight loss - I've lost 10kg this year, of which I would easily attribute 5kg to this medication alone.

When it go to the point that I was wearing either a wig or a hat every day to hide my hair loss I decided to go to the doctor. So 3 months ago the doctor, she put me on Spironolactone, 100mg once daily and also Rogaine 5%. I've done them both faithfully every day. To make a long story short, today I have a full head of hair. Just returned from the doctor and she was amazed at how fast it worked on me. I'm sold on it now!",feel'in happy

The first 4 months my hair continued to shed.  There were many times I panicked and wanted to stop taking it, thinking it would just get worse (dose of 100 morning and night). I'm so happy I pushed through, I now have a lot of new hair growth and the shedding has stopped.",Pcoslady

The first month or so, I did not see any changes.  By the second / third month, my hair was shedding; however, I also started to see hair growing in areas that I had none.  At the six month mark, the sprouts of hair I saw in the third/fourth month are approximately 1/2 inch long. Now, I do not see my scalp or that shiny scalp that you see on balding men.  Periodically, I have experienced scalp soreness.  Overall, I am very please with my hair growth.",Mudpie-Pearl

I have been suffering an initial shed that seems to be slowing down but at this point my hair looks quite a bit worse than before. Hopefully this will just take my body some time to get used to and it will help eventually.  I have continued taking it because it has cleared up my cystic acne 100%. For acne I would give this a 10/10 but for hair I'm not sure...,pcoslady

My plumbing is happy, too.  My doctor suggested I take Biotin as well.  I know it will take many months for me to see new growth, but that's okay.  My skin looks great, too!!",Everyone needs a dog

Not only after a few weeks my hairbrush didn't need a daily cleaning, my hair loss stopped completely & my re-growth is tremendous! I had lost about 1/3 of my hair, my parts were wide. Now I have my luscious locks back, and without breakage. No more tears!!!",Riggs

51,Spironolactone,Alopecia,8.0,,"March 5, 2015",123,My hair started thinning and falling out.  The dermatologist prescribed 100 mg of Spironolactone daily.  I had problems with high potassium levels so my dosage was decreased to 50 mg daily for a month and now I am back on the 100 mg.

53,Spironolactone,Alopecia,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 26, 2013",124,"I am 19 years old and have female androgenetic alopecia, at an alarmingly high stage at that. This had a HORRIBLE initial shed but it has stopped shedding and now I have less hair falling out. I don't see any regrowth though and am using minoxidil every other day so maybe if I used it regularly I'd be fine. Minoxidil is causing me to grow lots of facial hair though (5% concentration) and the spironolactone is supposed to fix hirsutism but the minoxidil is more dominating in the facial hair aspect... not giving up though because keeping hair on my head is more important than having a hairy face. I can just wax/thread facial hair.",SidQid
54,Spironolactone,Alopecia,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 22, 2013",99,"I've been taking spironolactone 50mg for 6 months, my skin cleared up dramatically almost perfectly.  It's not greasy anymore.  My hair feels softer but is still coming out a little, although it does feel much healthier I don't see any amazing regrowth.  I've decided to up the dose to 100mg because it doesn't hurt anymore.  It was a real curve coming from 25 to 50.  It hurt whenever I jumped right into 100mg when I first started.  I don't pee that much either even now on 100mg, I think my body has a tolerance for it.  Nothing hurts really but my stomach (not belly, but stomach right below the heart) that went away in time, the pain was more of a depleted feeling than a painful feeling. I had a little brain fog in the beginning, not anymore.",jubatron

I started noticing a dramatical change in my facial hair, it's all gone by 90%, for my hair loss I can say that I did see a big change but at least I'm not losing hair like I used to. It makes me urinate alot but its a normal thing. It all also helped me to lose weight. No side effect until now.",samiha
56,Spironolactone,Alopecia,10.0,,"March 24, 2011",114,"I had been experiencing hair loss for about 2 years. I finally decided to do some research and found out about spironolactone. Spironolactone slows down the hair loss but does not help hair regrowth. I decided to try it out and went to a dermatologist to have this medicine prescribed to me. The doctors started me off with a 50mg once a day. But during my research I found out that the effective dosage would be 200 mg a day (divided). So, I decided to do 200 mg a day. I am happy to say that my hair loss has completely stopped after two weeks of taking this medicine at 200 mg a day. I am also using Rogaine 5% twice a day. My problem is that I can not find a dermatologist that will prescribe me a stronger dosage. ",chula03

Much better than birth control pills that I stuck with for years, as I knew hair loss would intensify when I stopped them and boy did they ever.",Shedder
