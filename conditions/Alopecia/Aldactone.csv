0,Aldactone,Alopecia,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 2, 2020",26,"Worst decision taking Aldactone for alopecia. Took for 10x months and it left my hair worse, it is brittle, dehydrated I have severe mood swings. Thought it worked initially but then stopped. I would really make sure you are willing to take risks with this before starting. Dread shed occurs in beginning and when you stop. Exhaust other measures like vit c iron l lysine b12 selenium. Get your ferritin checked.",Teegan567
1,Aldactone,Alopecia,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 17, 2020",33,Taking 100 mg aldactone daily for two weeks and more hair shedding noticeable. They say it is not approved for hair growth. Should I stop.  I was given this for hair loss due to hypothyroidism,Pal
2,Aldactone,Alopecia,5,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 16, 2019",38,I started taking spiractin 50mg 10 months ago for alopecia and saw instant results. In 2 weeks my hair stopped shedding and I grew back all the hair I had lost in past 2 years. However it just stopped working 4 months ago and now I’m shedding over 200 hairs a day. My dermatologist doubled the dose to 100mg 2 months ago but unfortunately it’s made zero impact :(,Chekei
