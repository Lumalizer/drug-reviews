0,Baclofen,Cerebral Spasticity,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 18, 2021",0,I have Spastic Cerebral Palsy. Baclofen is one of a few drugs that I take for my associated Osteoarthritis. There is nothing superior in regards to spasms and cramping than Baclofen; it is far more effective than any non drug treatment for spasms and cramps as well.,Muffin Top
1,Baclofen,Cerebral Spasticity,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 30, 2021",1,"Been using baclofen for 25 years. It works yes but don’t underestimate the side effects if the dose is too high for example I take 20mg 3 times a day. When increasing the dose I dropped things, couldn’t think straight. Would fall asleep anywhere. I found I started to dribble and when drifting off I would miss breathes. Just be careful and have someone with you until you get used to it",Toad
