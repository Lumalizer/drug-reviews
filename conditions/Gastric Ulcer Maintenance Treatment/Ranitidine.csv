0,Ranitidine,Gastric Ulcer Maintenance Treatment,10,,"December 6, 2018",4,"This pill is a miracle I take 300mg twice a day 150mg  night ( with UC meds) . The pain was unbearable not sleeping constant pain. I have gastritis, Ulcerative Colitis and enlarged colon. I Can't process red meats, dairy. This helped where I  not hurt after eating. I was down to eggs, toast so I highly recommend this medication. But, of course everyone's body reacts differently.",Tiff

2,Ranitidine,Gastric Ulcer Maintenance Treatment,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 14, 2013",21,"I took this after omeprazole (both OTC and prescription) started to lose its efficacy (and after my insurance decided ranitidine was the better/cheaper option).  It gave me pretty severe flu-like symptoms almost immediately both times I took it, including dizziness, nausea, stomach pains, drowsiness, and even confusion.  Eating and drinking still hurt, so this didn't work very well for me.",angziety
