0,Pregabalin,Occipital Neuralgia,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 8, 2022",1,"My occipital neuralgia started out of the blue like 5 weeks ago and getting more scans tomorrow to find the cause. Today is day 8 on 75mg Lyrica  (3 times daily) and honestly I haven't noticed any improvement. I have constant throbbing pain in back of head with shooting pain in the temple and forehead/eye socket. I can't sleep, I can't work. Just miserable. Does Lyrica need to be taken for a few weeks before any benefit? I keep hoping for relief and none has arrived yet.",HoyaBo
1,Pregabalin,Occipital Neuralgia,10.0,,"January 23, 2022",0,"It took a few weeks using Pregabalin 75mg tablets two a.m. and two p.m. but I now have significant relief from pain in back of head. If I’m a few hours late taking meds, It feels like someone knocked me in back of head with a board. I take Baclofen and Aleve, and get massages for the trigger points in occipital muscles, neck, and traps. Daily stretches from PT also help with range of motion. The pain had been severe for about nine months. Glad I was finally prescribed Pregabalin and gave it some time. Can barely feel the head soreness when I take it at consistent times.",Jennifer

3,Pregabalin,Occipital Neuralgia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 11, 2019",26,"Pregabalin definitely makes a difference to my neuralgia- occipital. I don't notice any side effects on 75mg taken as needed, and it definitely helps. Let's me function without being knocked out just to get some relief from the pain. Not a silver bullet but definitely has given me back so much functioning and quality of life.",Edie
4,Pregabalin,Occipital Neuralgia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 7, 2019",25,"I COMPLETELY agree with DOOEE!! I have occipital neuralgia so felt like I had the worst hangover all day, everyday for years! Extreme dizziness, walking sideways, blacking out while walking, facial pain, brain drilling pain and pulsating, white noise, ringing in ears similar to passing out when you have a concussion.  Lyrica worked MIRACLES within 2 days  on it and I've not had 'bad' side affects other than dry mouth few hours after taking. THANK YOU TO MY NEURO TEAM FOR FINALLY GETTING IT RIGHT!!",Anonymous
