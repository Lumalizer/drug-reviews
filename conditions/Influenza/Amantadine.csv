0,Amantadine,Influenza,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 8, 2018",9,"This medicine was a literal living nightmare. I was a healthy 24 y.o. with the flu. ER gave it to me. After 5 days, I stopped taking it because of weird dreams. I woke up on the 6th day insane. Actual psychosis. Went back to ER and spent the next week sleeping, only waking up to use the restroom, eat, drink, take a sleeping pill to get back to sleep ASAP because every waking moment was horror.  I had flashbacks for a year. I've met doctors who see it on my chart and ask ""Did you go crazy?"". Yes, how did you know? It happens more than is officially reported. I can't explain just how terrifying it was, nonstop, for a week. I'd never take it again, not even for a million dollars.",Jamie
