0,Tamiflu,Influenza,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 28, 2022",0,This caused the worst headache ever that would not break and horrendous insomnia.  Never again. Would have been nice to be informed of possible side effects.,2felines
1,Tamiflu,Influenza,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 27, 2022",0,"This medication is horrible. My entire family came down with Influenza A, my wife took it first. Within a few hours of her first dose, she was vomiting. She took one more dose and quit taking it. I came down with the flu and took it next. At first it seemed great- took my 104.4 fever down to 97.7. I ended up taking 4 doses. First I had diarrhea about 30 mins after taking each dose. I began to become extremely dizzy, which was not really a symptom I had of the flu prior to taking it. Last night I took a dose with a full meal. My dizziness became unbearable, and I ended up violently dry heaving 10-15 times in a span of ten minutes. Been about 16 hours since my last dose and I am still dizzy. I will never take this again, and I will tell everyone I know not to take it.",Thrashindad
2,Tamiflu,Influenza,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 8, 2022",0,After struggling with the flu for several days I began taking Tamiflu. After 4 hours I began to feel slightly better. Within 24 hours I was up and feeling great. This is the second time taking Tamiflu. The first time was in 2009 when I contracted the N2H1 virus. I highly recommend this drug for flu symptoms.,Hannah
3,Tamiflu,Influenza,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 8, 2021",0,I had Flu-type B.    I took Tamiflu only 3 days.  I had to stop.   It RAISED my temperature!!!!  WHY I don't know but I couldn't handle that while also having Pneumonia.    I may never take it again because of that.,Kat
4,Tamiflu,Influenza,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 15, 2021",0,"I was recently diagnosed with the flu after I visited my doctor. I was running a fever on and off, had aches and chills, a headache on and off, and finally my stomach was a little off. One of the doctors at my office prescribed me Tamiflu, and I was on board because I wanted the few symptoms I had to go away. The first day I took it I had no side effects...the next day however, the side effects hit me hard. I was up for two hours early in the morning the following day with the worse abdominal pain I had ever had in my life. My stomach was worse than it was when I had the flu, and I had the worse diarrhea of my life. I somehow fell back to sleep, but I woke up later with a fever, and these awful stomach pains lasted for hours. I sat on the toilet for hours as well, and actually cried from the pain. I called up my doctors office and one of the doctors just told me to stop taking it altogether. I felt worse after taking the medicine, never again.",Carol S
5,Tamiflu,Influenza,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 4, 2021",0,"I was prescribed Tamiflu by my GP about 4 years ago for bad influenza. Within 4 hours or so, of taking a single pill,  a terrible anxious feeling came over me and the bedroom felt like it was closing in on me. It was a terrifying combination of anxiousness and claustrophobia I’ve never experienced before - which lasted 2 days. It was one of the worst experiences of my life and I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.",Derek

8,Tamiflu,Influenza,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 28, 2020",1,"We have had this last year for type A, and this year for type B.  I don’t know if it truly makes a difference.  No one in my family gets side effects from it, and I think it is expensive.  We do get flu vaccine, but the kids bring it home from a school.",Kat
9,Tamiflu,Influenza,10.0,,"February 28, 2020",8,"After mild symptoms of upper respiratory symptoms the day before, I awoke the next morning with 103.9F temp and thinking I might need to be hospitalized. My primary care physician had 1 sick visit slot open (thank goodness). By history and physical she diagnosed the flu and prescribed Tamiflu. I took the first dose and went back to bed. 6 hours later I felt better and no fever. I agree it is miraculous!",Cindy Lou
10,Tamiflu,Influenza,6.0,,"February 23, 2020",2,Started feeling bad Friday afternoon.. I started with a cough then by noon I had body aches all over.   That night ran a low fever.  Saturday I went to the ER tested positive for FLU type B. My throat was hurting a lot too. Took the tamiflu  and no real change in the way I felt. I was hoping that I would feel better... I think I should have been checked for strep.   I think I have it on top of the flu.    If you are still feeling bad.  Go get rechecked.,BJC

After two doses my temperature had gone back to normal. I did feel nauseous after the first dose and took Zofran to relieve the nausea. Fever did return but only a little over 100. After four doses no fever and feel pretty normal. Mind you, I did get the flu shot as I do every year. This is the first time in 30 years that I have gotten the flu!",Bucky

I took it that afternoon, and by the next morning my fever already started to go down. I'm on day 3 and while I still feel kind of sick, I'm not NEARLY as miserable as I would have been without it. I didn't need to take any Tylenol these past 2 days. My fever is totally gone, the only coughing I have now is productive in actually getting up phelgm. I didn't get any of the horrific side effects that people are mentioning here, and I'm starting to wonder if those occur when you don't actually have the flu. My partner got the same flu, but didn't see a doctor soon enough to get tamiflu, and it was awful",warbl

I did have the flu shot, we know it does not stop the flu, just lessens the severity.  I started Tamiful and I am now on day 5.  I must say that I started to feel better on day 3 of taking.  I do have some diarrhea and some chest congestion with a croupy cough.   I'm also on an antibiotic because I have a low immune system and doc wanted to cover all basis.  It does make me feel a little wonky and when I cough my heart does race.  All in all I would take it again.",Newplace
14,Tamiflu,Influenza,10.0,,"February 16, 2020",2,Doctor wouldn't give me tamiflu. Said it was only recommended for healthcare professionals. I think they didn't give it to me because they didn't have any flu swabs and you shouldn't take tamiflu without a positive flu swab. I would have loved to have had it since I was in bed feeling miserable for 4 days due to awful flu symptoms.,Main
15,Tamiflu,Influenza,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 16, 2020",23,"I woke up with a fever, body aches, chills and slight congestion and when my fever got pretty high and wouldn’t break I decided to go to the doctor. She did a basic checkup and decided I had the flu and prescribed me Tamiflu. She’d told me to take two pills that day with food. I took the first pill with a meal and within 10 minutes was uncontrollably vomiting. Over the span of three hours I vomited over and over again. Couldn’t keep anything down and even after all the food and liquids were out of my system I was vomiting bile. Literally the worst stomach cramps I have ever had in my life and my pain tolerance is pretty high. I ended up in the ER and had to have an IV for the pain and because I was so severely dehydrated. Awful experience and I would never EVER recommend such a dangerous drug to anybody. Also the doctor at the ER said it wasn’t a good quality drug and he never prescribed it to anyone because of the severe side effects.",Flo123

Prescribed Tamiflu. By Thursday, I began to feel somewhat normal. By Saturday I was up and about. I would definitely take again. I will say that it is imperative that you address the symptoms immediately in order for Tamiflu to fully work. The major side effect that I experienced was diarrhea. I’m now a week and 2 days out and my stomach is still experiencing issues, but overall this worked well.",Nee Bee

Got tested at urgent care right away (Type A influenza), was prescribed Tamiflu and an anti-nausea med to take with it, and was dosed within a day of my first symptoms. By the next morning, after two doses, I felt human again. I'm on Day 3 now and the fever and chills are gone. Still have a little digestive upset, but the vomiting is long gone. I feel like I'm in the final stages of a head cold. It has been amazing. I understand the secret is to start taking it as soon as possible after symptoms start. Probably helps, too, that I had a flu shot. I would definitely use this again.",bgwthompson

I took it and my flu symptoms went away, but I vomited twice about 2 hours later. After that, I had the worst diarrhea I’ve ever had. It felt like since there wasn’t much to expel from my body, stomach fluids were just pouring out of me along with sharp (?) barely digested bits of food. It was so bad my anus started bleeding. The pain was so bad I could barely walk. Don’t know if it’s worth it.",Park Jimin

Anyway, picked up the flu on vacation last week, and started getting sick Friday on the drive home. Went to the doctor Saturday, and surprise... it was the flu. Took my first dose of Tamiflu the same night, and am already feeling much better as of the next morning. I know the medicine can affect people differently, but for me this stuff works incredibly well. I have been good about my flu shots since the last time I got the flu, but had a similar experience with Tamiflu then too. That time I felt 100% better within 3 days of taking my first dose. And before you ask, yes, both cases were tested, confirmed cases of the flu. :-)",P

My husband had to take me to doctor since I couldn't drive from having recent surgery.   Got Monday afternoon appointment and doctor ran tests and confirmed I tested positive for flu.  The pharmacy never got my electronic prescription,  so Tuesday afternoon after my husband got off work,  they finally filled prescription.  Started taking Tamiflu that afternoon and started feeling better within hours.  I'm nearly finished with the prescription,  but still have cough, nasal congestion and am a little weak.

The hospital prescribed Tamiflu after my test came in positive and by the 3rd dose I began to feel life again. Any nausea and lightheaded effects could be from the flu itself not the meds, as I felt those symptoms anyway and actually fainted prior to the meds.

My doctor prescribed Zofran which is an anti nausea drug to take an hour before taking the  next Tamiflu dose.  It helped so much and I was able to finish it after 5 days.  I was feeling so much better after the 2nd day of the flu.  My 5 year old was also prescribed Zofran after he threw up and his only symptoms were a 2 day high fever and by the 3rd day he was running around like a normal kid.

Started Tamiflu later the same day.  I suffered from the classic flu symptoms for the rest of the day and through most of the night, but awoke with all chills and aches and pains gone.  With each pill, you can pretty much feel the symptoms wanting to restart at the dose point of 10-12hr.  I'm on day 3 currently and am symptom free, but realize the flu virus has two to five more days of working through me.  Truly impressed.",WA

Tamiflu gave me severe and terrible nausea that hurt. It made my brain swirl in an ocean and debilitated me to one position in bed. I could not move or I threw up even dry heaving. It was like I was poisoned.I do not recommend this unless you have no other choice. And by that I mean like maybe you had a low immune system or something and tamiflu was all that could help you or something. Please know going into this that zofran does nothing for the nausea and ginger root supplement pills helped maybe 25%. But with the ginger root, it interferes with other meds you may need for flu symptoms like Ibuprofen.

58,Tamiflu,Influenza,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 29, 2019",8,"I ended up with sudden flu symptoms the Monday before Christmas. Spent Tuesday and Wednesday suffering with a high fever, chills, headache, runny nose, everything and finally Thursday went to the doctor. Gave me Tamiflu and I was hopeful because I felt like death. I ate dinner before my first dose, took it, had pretty moderate nausea. Decided to change it up and not eat the next morning. Bad decision. Had some of the worst nausea of my life while the cable man was fixing my internet. My 4th dose has led to me now having diarrhea. I can’t tell if the relief out weights the nausea I felt for hours after each dose (though I do plan on stopping after my dose for tonight because I can’t handle anymore nausea.)",Annie

I wasn’t sick until I took this. After 5 doses I couldn’t stand the nausea anymore. Worse I have ever had. I was even taking Zofran for nausea but it did not help. It’s been 3 days since my last dose and I still feel like rubbish. I have completely lost my appetite. Trying to eat crackers and trying to stay hydrated. I have lost 10 lbs in 5 days. Never again. I just pray I start feeling better soon. I don’t recommend this medication to anyone.,Rudi
60,Tamiflu,Influenza,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 16, 2019",20,I took Tamiflu about a year or so ago and I experienced some of those severe side effects. I dealt with hallucinations and really dark thoughts which lead to me being baker-acted (hospitalized for mental health/self harm threat). I didn't attribute the stomach pains and nausea that I experience to the med until I read through these comments and now I realize that those symptoms were very much present as well. I had multiple panic attacks while this was in my system and I had never previously had one in my life. This absolutely was the worst experience of my life and I'm only thankful that I didn't ultimately harm myself or anyone else when I did take it. I would've much rather dealt with the flu than the side effects  I ended up experiencing. I hope no one else is having a similar or worst experience.,KB

My mouth tastes horrible and I think it is what is making me even more nauseous. Doc sent med for my young girls for prevention since they were exposed to the virus as well. They have not had any side effects. I do not think I am going to take my doses today. I cannot continue with this nausea and headache.",Reng

Day 2 I suffered from mild heartburn, but by day 3 the heartburn was so severe it kept me up in the night. Way down on that long list of possible side effects, dyspepsia (heartburn/indigestion) was listed. I am happy for those who found success with Tamiflu, but I will never take it again! It is not worth shaving off a day of being sick when some of the side effects can be much more painful or debilitating than the actual sickness.

Additionally I started to have random jerks with my arms and legs when I tried to sleep, I had intense chills, my eyes were dry and bloodshot, a intense headache. The worst part of the Tamiflu experience is that I was also not able to take me zofran for my vomiting. It reversed the effect of the zofran so instead of making my nausea go away it made it many times worse.

Shortly after the 6th dose I experienced acute abdominal pain, and severe nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. My abdomen hurt so badly I asked my husband to take me to the ER. The wait was painfully/unbearably long so decided to go home. I ate nothing but ice chips for 48 hours. Never made it past the 6th dose.

The main symptom that it helped with was his stuffy nose, sore throat and body aches. Within one day last time he was up and about. This time I see a difference starting two days after taking.  His fever was 102.3 for two solid days and it's down to normal. This only works if you start taking it within 24 hours after first symptoms begin.

Nope, do not eat a meal, you will get nauseous. I do want to add that those who are more nauseous than others probably have more mucus in their stomach. Just my opinion.

513,Tamiflu,Influenza,1.0,,"November 9, 2009",17,"On the morning of my second pill of Tamiflu, I went to have my hair done. Hair salon used the same chemicals on me that they have been for over 8 years and had a severe skin reaction with the bleach, due to Tamiflu. I had purple hives all over my face, my lips were red and swollen, my upper torso was covered in a red burning rash and my scalp has burns and sores all over it. I contacted my urgent care facility who administered it to me and they said severe skin reaction is a side symptom. I stopped taking the Tamiflu at their advice. ",Anonymous

I was so sick that I could barely get out of bed to take care of myself or my toddler, who also had influenza. By day 2 on the medication, I felt about 80% better. Influenza is a much more serious virus than I ever thought. Thank goodness for antivirals.",Salpal
516,Tamiflu,Influenza,7.0,,"June 9, 2009",24,I used this drug for suspected Swine Flu. It definitely works wonders but what I noticed was that it affected my brain in some ways. I am confused and less tolerant than I was before. I am hoping it is temporary. ,Anonymous
