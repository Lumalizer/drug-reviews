2,Xofluza,Influenza,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 17, 2020",3,I went to a doctor for pain all over my body. The test for flu and strep throat came out negative. Because of my age and my condition he gave me Xofluza. Next two days I developed high fever and by Monday when I went to my primary doctor I had developed bronchitis. That was by the end of January and still this day I'm not 100% well.,LSE
3,Xofluza,Influenza,10.0,,"March 9, 2020",5,"12 year old daughter diagnosed with Flu A with high fever and soreness on Thursday afternoon.  Took Xofluza  in early evening on Thursday and by Friday morning she had no symptoms, never got a fever again, and never developed any cold symptoms or respiratory symptoms.  She typically gets the flu annually, despite getting the vaccine.  We’ve had a very positive experience with Xofluza!   No side effects. We paid about $70 with insurance and coupon, worth every penny.",Lena62197
4,Xofluza,Influenza,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 8, 2020",2,"I felt bad on Tuesday, as if I had a bad sinus infection, got a doctor's appt on Wednesday.  Tested positive for Flu type A.  Took xofluza that Wednesday.  On Thursday, woke with my head pounding, ears stopped up, runny nose, deep cough, and a sore throat.  Friday, had a horrible painful day, definitely the most achy pain filled weak day of them all.  Saturday, feeling a little better but still a horrific cough, sore throat, headache, and weakness.Sunday, thinking I may have to return to the doctor Monday.  I still have weakness, runny nose, ears full, deep cough, sore throat, barely a voice, and basically the same way that I felt when I went to the doctor.I don't think this medicine works well with me.",Ladyskooters
5,Xofluza,Influenza,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 1, 2020",2,"Went to urgent care after one and half brutal days of flu symptoms..felt like  it was the end of me. Only had the flu once in my life and just knew it was the flu again. Got swabbed positive for flu type A. Took the 2 pills the night I went to urgent care (Thurs). Friday I was about 70% better. Today is Saturday I’ve cleaned and disinfected the house, got some sushi and feel normal besides the insomnia but I’ll take it . Highly recommend. Only side effect is similar to tamiflu and that’s weird dreams and restless legs but I’ll take it over the flu symptoms. Just take it or suffer longer .",Carey

Went into an emergency clinic (Just outside of 48 hour suggested window, was maybe 53 hours from very first symptom) and was prescribed Xofluza. Within 12 hours of taking the prescribed dose my cough had almost disappeared! No more fever  and all other symptoms greatly reduced.

12,Xofluza,Influenza,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 2, 2020",3,"I took Xofluza within 48 hrs of flu symptoms showing. I think it did cut down the length of the flu, however, I had the WORST dryness.  My mouth was dry, my chest congestion was dry, my eyes were dry. I felt dehydrated but I definitely was not. All the dryness caused bronchitis.  Now, I'm treating that. It was so painful I could not sleep. I would not take it again.",Mrs Conner

By 6 am, symptoms worsened with severe body aches, chills, and headache. Went to the urgent care around 10 am and the doctor gave me a free sample of Xofluza. Took the medication with food around 11 am. Still dealt with some gnarly symptoms all day yesterday with my temperature going up to 102.8. Napped on and off with cold sweats, headache, body aches. I also took ibuprofen every time my temperature had risen and headache worsened. By 11 am today, my temperature was finally 97.9. My headache isn’t as severe, but it’s still there.

I shouldn't have even driven.  Anyway, the medicine is very expensive so I asked if he would just give me antibiotics... The doctor didn't want to give me antibiotics so he gave me a sample of the Xofluza and OMG, I went home took the 2 pills, took a nap and about 4 to 5 five hours later there was a significant difference.  The next day, still feeling a little under the weather and weak, but I'm up and around doing housework and laundry.... Wonderful stuff...",Karen

Decided to head straight to the urgent care and they prescribed me Xofluza.  Took my first and only dose at 2pm my temp was 102.8 and my muscles were aching as if I pulled my back. Nose was stuffy and had a bad headache.  It is now 8:30pm.  My temp is 100.3 and my body aches are dramatically reduced, headache gone and nose it no longer stuffy.
