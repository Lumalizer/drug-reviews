0,Baclofen,Muscle Twitching,5,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 13, 2020",12,Have ms and sometimes legs feel like I gotta itch then leg twitches... have difficulty walking already but I donâ€™t actually acknowledge benefits being that twitching happens rarely. I have noticed makes my mouth severely dry at night and my gums bleed daily when I brush my teeth. I read online that medication causes dry mouth which in turn causes gum disease. Some days I take medication and get severely tired 20 minutes after taking it.,Whytrip
