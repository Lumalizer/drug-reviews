0,Methotrexate,Neoplastic Diseases,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 19, 2015",2,"I am taking this for a systemic autoimmune disease. 4 injections so far of 40mg once a week, I can move around. It takes a while to start working, but it's working. Doc said if I take this prescribed overload of folic acid I won't lose my hair. It's a chemotherapy. It makes me nauseous. It makes me tired. But so does the disease. Is giving me infections of the skin, mouth, and eyes. Doc says that might just be because my body is one big infection fighting itself all at once.",Annie Nonomous
