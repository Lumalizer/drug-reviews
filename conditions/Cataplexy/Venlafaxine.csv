0,Venlafaxine,Cataplexy,7,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 30, 2020",2,"I took venlafaxine for five years to treat cataplexy. When 2020 started last January I was 325lb. The pros well that this drug does treat Cataplexy it is literally a miracle worker. The con is that if you ever skip a day it feels like you’ve been hit by a truck and every episode that you should’ve head feels like it’s coming at one time. Also this truck causes water retention which can also lead to high blood pressure and obesity taking this truck for five years I started to have night terrors so bad that my neighbors can hear me screaming and called the police at least three times terrified that someone is trying to hurt me because this drug will cause that to happen. Today’s date is December 30, 2020 and since December 10, 2020 I have been completely off of all my medication, And I have not had  A bad dream I’m not over eating I’ve lost 20 pounds",Kay
1,Venlafaxine,Cataplexy,5,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 4, 2019",3,"It worked fairly well with my cataplexy. I’d sometimes experience cataplexy attacks only at the end of the day or when I’m too tired.The main issue was with the side effects. I had to suffer from weight gain, Periodic Limb Movement affecting my sleep quality, and REM Parasomia.",King Faisal
2,Venlafaxine,Cataplexy,7,,"November 6, 2019",5,"I was prescribed 150mg of Venlafaxine mainly to treat my cataplexy, but my doctor also told me it would help with my anxiety and depression. On the cataplexy side of things it helps 100% I don’t have any episodes unless I’m really exhausted, but the bad thing is if I miss one dose I get  bad brain zaps and my cataplexy comes back but 10x worse so missing a dose is the worst. On the anxiety/depression side of things it mellows my negative emotions out. One bad thing I’ve noticed is that the medication isn’t as effective during my period.Overall the medicine is okay, I just wish it was more effective during my period. I’m not sure if this is just an issue with this meds for me or if it would be like this with other antidepressants though.",Drowsy
3,Venlafaxine,Cataplexy,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 4, 2017",17,"its a no brainer, without I am as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike,with 75 mg per day I am confident for any situation, it changed my life in 1 day.To not be able to take part in every day life, to not smile laugh love be hurt be funny be normal.Any risk of emotion, tipped me of the edge and I do mean any, You know when life is bad, when your scared to cross a road fearful of not getting to the other side without collapsing in a quivering heap Before diagnosed life was an every day hellthank god for it, easy to take, and many years later the same now just like the first time.Work a treat good luck\Robert Marsden",Robert Marsden
