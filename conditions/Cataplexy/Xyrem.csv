0,Xyrem,Cataplexy,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 29, 2020",8,"Xyrem helped with the cataplexy symptoms and helped with my day to day. However, the first dose did not always work and that left me in a very disorienting state. I also suffer from depression and the xyrem intensified this. I overdosed twice because of this. I had zero self control when taking this medicine. The first overdose was on purpose. The second, Iâ€™m not sure, I blacked out. This medicine really helps, since being taken off I realized how much is was helping. However mentally it is better for me to be off it.",Ree
1,Xyrem,Cataplexy,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 29, 2017",14,"I have narcolepsy with cataplexy and also sleep apnea. I started taking Xyrem about 3 years ago, and the difference in my ability to function is phenomenal. No more hypnogogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, drastically improved cataplexy, very few episodes of sleep paralysis. And for about 5 minutes before it knocks me out, I get a buzz of epic proportions. Sadly, xyrem has gone up more than 800% in price. It costs over $5,000 per bottle, and I'm on 3 bottles per month. Unwanted side effects that I've experienced are, during titration (dose increased by Dr) 1. I had trouble breathing properly. 2. the first night of my highest dose (4.25) it knocked me out so hard that I wet the bed. 3. Wicked vocab. I swear a lot during a dose. idk why!",Rizzamae
2,Xyrem,Cataplexy,9.0,,"July 5, 2016",16,I am 57 years old and have had some version of narcolepsy since age 30 or 35. I tried Nuvigil and then added Adderal  but still had breakthrough narcolepsy and cataplexy. The cataplexy broke my foot a year ago and my wrist six months ago. This is the most amazing medication! I would go to bed at midnight and awaken at 10 or 11 in the morning. I would fall asleep for a cumulative 2 to 3 more hours during the day. I awaken between seven and 8 o'clock bright eyed and bushy tail to use my parents phrase. I am fully alert and have no further problems with sleepiness throughout the day.  I am still experiencing occasional morning nausea and inappropriate  diaphoresis or sweating for no reason. An ice pack at the back of my neck will break it.,Surreal2000
3,Xyrem,Cataplexy,10.0,,"January 26, 2012",27,I've been taking Xyrem for about 6 yrs at 4.5gms 2 x a night. My doctor said I had the worst case of Cataplexy he'd seen in his career! Xyrem with 40mgs of Desoxyn and 150mgs of Effexor during the day I have a life again! I still have to nap about midday and I still won't chance a comedy club (the Cataplexy still sneaks in once in a while) but I hope to some day. I found out the hard way to make sure you don't drink anything before taking because you will NOT wake up to pee until the dose wears off! A small price to pay when I consider what it was like before Xyrem. ,Anonymous
4,Xyrem,Cataplexy,10.0,,"November 5, 2011",21,I have had a great improvement in my mental function. I can now pay attention and follow along with what is going on around me. With a switch to Desoxyn as a daytime medication wow I feel like a normal person at least for me. Get a safe to keep it in as the ramification of having it stolen are great. And the paperwork long. The number of agency's involved boggled my mind. ,bluhat
