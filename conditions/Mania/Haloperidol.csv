0,Haloperidol,Mania,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 3, 2022",0,"I was put on a once a month haldol injection a year and a half ago. At first it seemed to do its job. I came down from mania/psychosis. But after a few months I entered a deep depression. About a year into the injection, I checked myself into the hospital for suicidal ideation. Ultimate low point. I started seeing a new doctor who kept me on it but I wasn’t ever happy with it. This past month my nurse missed my injection appointed by accident and I ended up going another week without the injection and I felt a hell of a lot better. My intrusive thoughts went away, I can hold a conversation and I’m not always so annoyed. I decided to go back on geodon because I believe this hadol injection is the root of many issues and side affects I was unaware of. The haldol also made me feel like I was in a fog and never really felt grounded. Hoping the switch to geodon will solve my problem. I never want to take haldol again.",Tortilla
1,Haloperidol,Mania,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 9, 2021",0,"Haldol (haloperidol):Was given this crappy drug last summer at the hospital in the psych ward and everyone was terrified of me! I got an injection so I had to go through a MONTH of this horror. I had insanely slurred speech, my voice sounded more high pitched and tired, I slept ALL DAY, I had terrible akathisia, night terrors, nobody wanted me around, I was more anxious than usual and I wanted to die for relief. The side effects wore off completely, 20 days after I took it on the first of August 2020. Never taking this drug again. I’m on Zoloft and Valium right now, so much better. As for this crap, 0/10. Smh",Cyan
2,Haloperidol,Mania,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2021",0,Gave me rebound psychosis and I'm certain it gave me some sort of brain damage. Induces have sedation and motor impairment. Very dangerous drug,Doug
3,Haloperidol,Mania,,,"September 19, 2021",0,"I was on haloperidol at a dosage of 150mg which is the highest? I took the depot because it would enable me to get out of hospital. I had bad side effects such as not being able to eat. I would try to eat something and start to feel nauseous. I also had really bad insomnia. My speech was effected to the point that I couldn’t speak coherently at all and I displayed signs of having the symptoms of what Stephen hawking had during his early days of motor neurone disease when he was trying to walk. Time seemed to be moving so slow. I would look at the clock, look away and look back at some point thinking it had been about an hour and only a few minutes would have past. The drug was seriously impacting on me in a negative way which lead me to try to kill myself. Depots do help some people but others don’t have it so good",Trevor
4,Haloperidol,Mania,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 7, 2021",0,"I’d been on Haldol for about a year and it’s been the worst year of my life. I’m bipolar and was prescribed it when I was on a manic high. Worst pill I’ve ever taken, I turned into a zombie who just wanted to sleep all the time rather than face life. I’ve gained weight which added to the depression. I developed anhedonia and couldn’t find pleasure in anything. Lack of sex drive, no motivation, breast lactation and anxiety are just some of the other symptoms I experienced. I continued to take it for so long as I just assumed my bipolar was playing up but I’ve been off the haldol for 2 days now and I can already feel my mood getting better. Antipsychotics are awful, haldol is not a safe drug and should be banned. It left me suicidal and I’m so glad I made the decision to come off it. Not sure what my psychiatrist is going to think about it but I don’t really care. I’m getting my life back! Avoid at all costs.",Stacey182
5,Haloperidol,Mania,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 3, 2019",24,"This haloperidol is the worst drug I have ever been given in my life. After the injection I was immediately not able to speak. My feet started tapping and kicking uncontrollably. 12 hours later I had extreme tightening of the jaw, the tightening went down my neck. I couldn’t swallow my spit and me trying to say my name and birthdate sounded like when a deaf person was trying to speak. Very rapidly my neck and spinal muscles contracted backwards, eyes were stuck rolled behind my head, completely locked up and painful, apparently this is a side effect called dystonia. I couldn’t get a word out. Thankfully a doctor gave me the antidote to cure this reaction (Benadryl!!!) and within a minute my body started to go back to normal, and I started sobbing happy tears. Scariest medication of my life. Please be careful with this one.",Bipolar 1 gal
6,Haloperidol,Mania,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 9, 2019",4,"It was great while I took it. Made me feel ""normal"". Took 5mg of this medication for 3 months and was pulled off of it cold turkey because I developed a jaw tic. Well, two weeks later I couldn't eat without throwing up. Went to the hospital and they did normal tests and said I was fine. Two days later I had obsessive swallowing, dysphagia, and dry mouth which lasted until now (1 1/2 weeks) went to urgent care and found out I went from 133 pounds to 116 in two weeks. Not to mention suicidal thoughts MUCH worse than before I ever started taking medication. Been drinking ensure and just started to be able to eat pureed food. DO NOT GO COLD TURKEY.",G
7,Haloperidol,Mania,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 2, 2019",14,"Haldol (haloperidol):I took this once 4 years ago, NEVER took it ever again because I had the worst side effects ever. I was on vacation at the time and I took it because of my manic episodes. I felt soooooooo sleepy yet so restless in my legs and extremely panicky. I had the worst panic attack in my life, screaming my head off at the uncomfortableness in my legs, squirming around like crazy in bed and pacing back and forth. Finally I took a bath and I realized my eyes were yellow! I almost fell to the floor but I made it to the bed and I slept from 7pm to 12pm the next day and even then I was still a zombie. Later that day the side effects wore off and I was able to enjoy my vacation again. Now I'm on a different medication. NEVER AGAIN will I take haldol because it messed me up",Kiera
8,Haloperidol,Mania,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2019",65,"Haldol (haloperidol):If you enjoy facial tics, muscle tremors, uncontrollable pacing, rocking back and forth, stuttering, insomnia, extreme restlessness, blackouts, memory lapses, sleeping 14-16 hours a day, and a complete loss of personality, identity, and all emotions then by all means try this med. Since the injection lasts a month you can look forward to 30 days of these symptoms. I often fantasize about injecting the doc, who gave me this horrible stuff, with a dose and then releasing him out in the world like he did to me.",Socialfilter
9,Haloperidol,Mania,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 2, 2018",2,"It made me more stable I got less angry and less excited- that is the point of it I think. I usually take 5-10  drops or at the most 20 drops a day,  any more than that causes problems.",lifewater
10,Haloperidol,Mania,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 10, 2016",20,"Haldol (haloperidol):I was given one injection of this with Benadryl by a nurse whom by the doctor in charge was not granted permission to administer the medications. I was sleeping in the ER after four days was woken up by the nurse and told I was a nuisance to him and he and three other male orderlies in the ER told me they were sick of seeing me there. I told him I might have a seizure if it's a drug that wasn't my current medicine and he said he didn't care. Ten minutes or less I had a seizure and the hospital then released me, I found out they were ill equipped to deal with seizures in the specific ER. What a total waste of time! Haldol was horrible for me. Would never recommend!",Creepyteddybear
11,Haloperidol,Mania,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 4, 2015",10,"Haldol (haloperidol):Parent to son with psychotic experiences diagnosed bipolar mania by one doctor and Schizo affective disorder by another. Been on a 3 year roller coaster nightmare. Refusal to take sulpiride and risperidone orally for any time resulted in having depot injections but our experience to date of the depot injections is more negative given the side affects. Like lost personality, tiredness, restlessness. Bouts of long sleeping followed by walking round and round the room. When standing rocking from foot to foot. Inability to engage in conversations. Sense of hopelessness ..We didn't really clue up on the drug and are concerned about the inability to come off/reduce them because a months worth has been injected then topped up.",fish41
12,Haloperidol,Mania,2.0,,"September 16, 2015",6,Haldol (haloperidol):it made me have violent twitching and uncontrolled facial movements.... it made my mania Worse! Gonna get back on Thorazine. ..,AChrisA
13,Haloperidol,Mania,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 22, 2014",15,"Caused muscle contraction in My neck. Very painful and frightening. Was given a shot of cogentin and it subsided. Caused drowsiness, constipation and marked sleepiness. Emotional flatness. It increased My depression.",RollinRobert1
14,Haloperidol,Mania,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 6, 2013",23,In spite of what many people have said about this medicine I have found it very helpful in both treating and preventing episodes of mania.  The risk of developing Tardive Dyskinesia is of course a concern but this medicine has been so useful for me.  I have received it both by I.M injection and orally as the ten milligram tablets and both routes were well tolerated and effective.,Todd R
