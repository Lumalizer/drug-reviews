1,Depakote,Mania,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 25, 2020",5,Depakote has helped my racing thoughts and anxiety so much. I take depakote DR in the morning with my lamictal it’s great for racing thoughts. Depakote can make you kind of tired one reason why I’m on lamictal ! I’m on 250 mg will increase to 500 soon.,Anonymous
2,Depakote,Mania,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 28, 2020",23,"I have taken Depakote (or a 'good' generic) of this medication for nearly 3 decades. It is very effective, has few side effects (with the exception of weight gain which is responsive to diet and exercise). This is a far more effective and moderate drug than what I was initially prescribed (Lithium-on which I hallucinated and felt terrible). I've had no long term effects to date, maintain my dosage and lead a  healthy life with this medication. Be careful when using GENERICS...some vary immensely. Let  your doctor and pharmacist know immediately if you have issues. (IE: Find the right generic or return to the original Depakote brand). Lovely and effective for a ""unipolar"" patient that I am.",gf

It has made a huge difference in my quality of life. The best part is that it’s been on the market for many, many years, is affordable and has no long term dangers. Do try it, I hate pills but this one is worth it if you are anxious and/or depressed.",Gabbie

6,Depakote,Mania,1.0,,"October 31, 2019",24,"My mother who has a mental disability and is 56 years old was prescribed this medication twice while residing in a long term care facility under the reasons of ""behavior."" The first time she was on approximately 1000mg and it made her sleep for hours, put her in a fog, made her delay in response if she even responded at all. I asked several times for her to be taken off of the medicine and the facility was disagreeable. She was hospitalized for malnutrition and severe dehydration where I was able to convince the doctors to remove most of the dosage. They kept her on a low dosage between 125mg to 250mg. She did fine, three years later they increased the med to approximately 500 mg and put her on more behavior meds. Same thing happened, went back to hospital this time with sepsis in the blood from lack of hydration and UTI. This medicine is good for some and not for others, doctors should listen when expressing concerns and symptoms caused by this med.",Ross
7,Depakote,Mania,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 21, 2016",29,Good medicine. Blood tests are annoying. I wet the bed a couple nights a week on this med because it knocked me out. It takes a while to get used to but it's overall not that bad of a med. Works well for mania.,Bipolar type Schizzoaffective
8,Depakote,Mania,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 24, 2015",20,"Depakote is helping my anxiety and resulting alcohol abuse. It is not a ""cure"" for drinking heavily, it does make it much easier to maintain though.",Porch Honkey
9,Depakote,Mania,4.0,,"April 4, 2011",104,"So glad I had the opportunity to read how others feel about Depakote.  I have used Depakote for 8 years now for the manic side of bipolar disorder.  I have not had one manic episode since on the medication.  Great right?  I also feel as though the past 8 years of my life have slipped by and are a bit of a blur.  I was an artist, graphic designer, and had a sense of humor.  Now I feel like a numb hermit who continues to stay on this medication because she doesnt want another manic episode.",Anonymous
10,Depakote,Mania,9.0,,"October 6, 2009",54,I have been on Depakote for 4 years now and I haven't had an episode of Hypermania. This has changed my life. I have gained about 40 pounds but it is a small price to pay for the positive changes. I control the anxiety with occasional klonopin. I am working on healthy diet and exercise for the weight.,Lwacherokee

13,Depakote,Mania,1.0,,"May 4, 2009",61,"I cannot account for those with Bi-Polar I, but this may apply to you if you have been diagnosed with social anxiety, Bipolar II or a mild form of the disorder. On 1000mg (combined with 200mg Lamictal) I felt ""far away"" when talking to people. I cut back down to 500mg. I began to feel it was inhibiting my creativity; sometimes I felt ""dumb."" I used other drugs to combat the Depakote from holding me back. Plus drinking on it caused depression and knocked me out. My doctor should not have put me on this medication to treat me for anxiety.",taylz
