0,Valproic acid,Mania,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 10, 2014",26,"Bipolar I, I never went manic except during extreme stress, impending death of a family member, when I was under so much stress that I could not remember if I had taken my medication.  I have never been one to abandon medication because I ""missed"" the high.  The only other hospitalization was when a rural local 'doctoe in a box' prescribed Prednisone, despite the fact it is contraindicated for Bipolar and that I listed that I was Bipolar on intake sheet.  That resulted in an 11 day hospitalisation to get my medications straight.In 2005 changed to Valproic Acid.  I did have a manic episode requiring hospitalization prior to my brother's death in 2007.  Since then I have had no problems, except low level depression, which I call being 'flat'.",LLG
