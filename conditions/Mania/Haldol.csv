0,Haldol,Mania,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 9, 2021",0,"Was given this crappy drug last summer at the hospital in the psych ward and everyone was terrified of me! I got an injection so I had to go through a MONTH of this horror. I had insanely slurred speech, my voice sounded more high pitched and tired, I slept ALL DAY, I had terrible akathisia, night terrors, nobody wanted me around, I was more anxious than usual and I wanted to die for relief. The side effects wore off completely, 20 days after I took it on the first of August 2020. Never taking this drug again. Iâ€™m on Zoloft and Valium right now, so much better. As for this crap, 0/10.

1,Haldol,Mania,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 2, 2019",14,"I took this once 4 years ago, NEVER took it ever again because I had the worst side effects ever. I was on vacation at the time and I took it because of my manic episodes. I felt soooooooo sleepy yet so restless in my legs and extremely panicky. I had the worst panic attack in my life, screaming my head off at the uncomfortableness in my legs, squirming around like crazy in bed and pacing back and forth. Finally I took a bath and I realized my eyes were yellow! I almost fell to the floor but I made it to the bed and I slept from 7pm to 12pm the next day and even then I was still a zombie. Later that day the side effects wore off and I was able to enjoy my vacation again. Now I'm on a different medication. NEVER AGAIN will I take haldol because it messed me up",Kiera
2,Haldol,Mania,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2019",65,"If you enjoy facial tics, muscle tremors, uncontrollable pacing, rocking back and forth, stuttering, insomnia, extreme restlessness, blackouts, memory lapses, sleeping 14-16 hours a day, and a complete loss of personality, identity, and all emotions then by all means try this med. Since the injection lasts a month you can look forward to 30 days of these symptoms. I often fantasize about injecting the doc, who gave me this horrible stuff, with a dose and then releasing him out in the world like he did to me.",Socialfilter
3,Haldol,Mania,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 10, 2016",20,"I was given one injection of this with Benadryl by a nurse whom by the doctor in charge was not granted permission to administer the medications. I was sleeping in the ER after four days was woken up by the nurse and told I was a nuisance to him and he and three other male orderlies in the ER told me they were sick of seeing me there. I told him I might have a seizure if it's a drug that wasn't my current medicine and he said he didn't care. Ten minutes or less I had a seizure and the hospital then released me, I found out they were ill equipped to deal with seizures in the specific ER. What a total waste of time! Haldol was horrible for me. Would never recommend!",Creepyteddybear
4,Haldol,Mania,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 4, 2015",10,"Parent to son with psychotic experiences diagnosed bipolar mania by one doctor and Schizo affective disorder by another. Been on a 3 year roller coaster nightmare. Refusal to take sulpiride and risperidone orally for any time resulted in having depot injections but our experience to date of the depot injections is more negative given the side affects. Like lost personality, tiredness, restlessness. Bouts of long sleeping followed by walking round and round the room. When standing rocking from foot to foot. Inability to engage in conversations. Sense of hopelessness ..We didn't really clue up on the drug and are concerned about the inability to come off/reduce them because a months worth has been injected then topped up.",fish41
