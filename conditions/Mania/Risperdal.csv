0,Risperdal,Mania,8,,"December 6, 2020",4,"I have just started taking Risperdal I'm 5 days in, was taking 2mg first 2 days but side effects were really intense for me so I've dropped to 1mg.Side effects for me are not being able to sleep, Other than during severe anxiety attacks never had sleep issues.There's this strange thing with my eyes which is hard to explain... I have blurred vision but also a kind of ""eye ball pain"" if that makes sense, kind of uncontrollable movement.Anyway I'm hoping all of this subsides as just in the past 5 days my paranoia (which was getting increasingly out of control, to the point I couldn't even check my mail box) has lightened a lot!  My anxiety levels have decreased, I'm still obsessing a little but overall I feel better mentally",Bipolar Bear
1,Risperdal,Mania,1,,"May 29, 2019",30,"Couldn't sweat/exercise.  I Had horrible  tardive dyskinesia (flexing my lips all the time), tremors, mood swings, black spots in vision, overheating, overeating, dropped out of college because I could no longer write  and even had trouble focusing on simple reading. Then I stopped drinking 6 cups of coffee a day and succumbed to the med and all it did was put me away for 12+ hours.  I couldn't do anything but eat. I thought my life was over. When I came off the drug, even when I tapered, I experienced hallucinations (more black spots, fuzzy vision). A lot of my ""delusions"" were fear that I had MS. This phobia ruled my life until all of the risperdal was out of my system along with the rebound anxiety with it.Took it for 4 months and gained 70 lbs. I feel like this kind of medication is overprescribed all of the time. I'm back on track with my life now and I'll never touch another med of this classification again. I feel insulted that someone tried to do this to me.",Kinde
2,Risperdal,Mania,5,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 22, 2018",9,"Pros: Decreased delusions, decreased hallucinations due to mania (Diagnosed Bipolar 1). I felt calmer mentally and physically throughout the day even though I would take the Risperidone at night. I started out at 4 mg (to kick mania in the butt) for the first 2-3 months and then tapered off to 1 mg at bedtime. Slept 7-8 hrs every night for almost 1 yr!! Which was great because I have insomnia too.Cons: Lactation (lasted 1 week), Amenorrhea (missed period) effects only 2% of women and I was one of them, straining when urinating (happened 2 times), high cholesterol, weight gain, and muscle spasms.I rated this drug 5 out of 10 because of the side effects. Since being off the drug I got my period back very intense, my cholesterol is getting slowly back to normal, lost the weight, and muscle spasms are pretty minor to almost none.",LG23
