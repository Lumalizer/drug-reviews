0,Lithium,Mania,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 5, 2021",5,This medicine works great for what it's used for I'm Bipolar 1 but Lithium+Atypical Anti-psychotic (Seroquel) has fixed my Bipolar 1 Mania and Mixed States (Severe). I'm balanced again I also take Prozac with the Seroquel for the Severe treatment resistant Bipolar Depression with suicidal thoughts (fixed) And I feel stable again no highs lows or mixed states. I'm finally me again . I can think with a clean mind again.,Anonymous
1,Lithium,Mania,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 21, 2021",2,"Lithium is a good drug for most Bipolar people. It is EXTREMELY important to get the right dosage. You can ramp up slowly. I was on the regular lithium for about 15 years, and I still had highs and lows. When I switched to the TIME RELEASE version, life got smooth and much better. I was taking 900 regular now I am taking 900 ER (time released). You have to be careful it does not have super bad problems with it. It all has to do with concentration. If you are not continuously drinking about 1/2 to 1 gal of water a day, the lithium becomes more concentrated, making too sleepy for driving or even thinking right. So if you feel weird, drink as much water as you can.So I both love and fear my lithium. Not sure any drug would be better. You need to rely on blood tests which need to be within 0.5 and 1.2 mg of Li and check in quarterly with a psych who has experience in this. I am usually at 0.7 I have been on Li for 27 years.",Not my real name
2,Lithium,Mania,10.0,,"September 10, 2020",12,"When I was 19 years old I was diagnosed with BPD & bipolar disorder. They tried just putting me on lamictal, hydroxyzine, & seroquel. 2 days later I still felt Suicidal. I then started on 900mg of Lithium.  After 3 days by the time I left I remember my first experience. As my dad drove me home I remember how everything around me seemed brighter. Almost 4 years later I’m now on 600mg ER. So many of my symptoms have improved and I went from suicidal ideations 25 times a day to around 5. Lithium gave me my relationship, my job, and I’m now in the beginning stages of going to rx school. Despite being thirsty (side effects took about 3 months to disappear, hand tremor, hot/cold flashes, thirst) PLEASE talk to your md about this drug. Everyone is different but this drug made me who I am today. It amazes me that one drug (I also take lamictal er 250) can make me feel so stable. LITHIUM IS AMAZING",Mrclements97
3,Lithium,Mania,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 22, 2020",17,"Lithium is pretty awesome. My doctor said I was experiencing mania because lights were so intensified, my mind would be constantly thinking and worrying, had some mood swings, and I was becoming paranoid and seeing things in my peripheral vision. It's really scary to be told that I may be hallucinating or paranoid due to mania. I read up on lithium and I told myself to not take it because of its negative impacts on the thyroid. I took lamictal (which was great) but it was not helping as much as I needed it to and my memory was declining. I quit lamictal and tried 300 mg lithium, and I experienced little to no mood swings, I can think logically and more clear than before, and I am not very paranoid. Obviously it is not going to cure EVERYTHING all at once, but it definitely does reduced half my issues. If your doctor prescribes this, try it out and do not be afraid.",paradiselover
4,Lithium,Mania,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 16, 2020",8,"I have been on Lithium for about 3 months now and I'm pleased to say that it is working great. Lithium has helped my mania and depression so much! I was still struggling with anxiety, but that is not one of the side effects I got from Lithium. Watch out for the common ones- eye twitching, cravings, nausea, but after about 2 weeks, it went away. I highly suggest Lithium for anyone who is constantly maniac or schizophrenic.",Ran S
5,Lithium,Mania,,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 25, 2019",11,"I was about to go into the hospital last night. I have been hospitalized 19 times. I was breaking things and freaking out until I took this medicine. I now feel like a different person but only this time it's in a good way. I like how I feel now, and I don't want to use drugs to cope with my feelings anymore because my meds are working now.Thank you whoever invented this stuff!",Tom
6,Lithium,Mania,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 25, 2019",14,"Safe is how I feel now when I continue on lithium. I have been diagnosed with bipolar mania and had three hospital stays and a a stint in jail as a result of not taking my meds. For the past three years I have led a normal life taking 1000mg daily. I wouldn't miss my dose because the consequences are not worth it. I can say that my wacky sense of humour and messy around with my kids hasn't been taken away at all, I love laughing and making people laugh and I feel incredible love and sometimes hate. But mostly again I feel safe.",Safe
7,Lithium,Mania,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 18, 2018",5,Miracle drug!  1200mg (going to see if can be brought down to 900mg as only minor difference when raised). Came off other drugs slowly.,geek3d

9,Lithium,Mania,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 12, 2013",18,"For some, lithium is the most effective choice for bipolar mania.  Unfortunately for me, it's not.  My body rebelled against it immediately and without pause for its entire 60-day 'trial'.  My bowels were never solid the entire time.  I'm amazed now that I never recognized any dehydration symptoms over that time.  It worked for my dear departed mother, but not for me, but I gave it a shot.",CrackerMan21
10,Lithium,Mania,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 26, 2012",26,"Aside from some of the crummy side effects, bipolar disorder would not and could not be tolerable without lithium. I used to take Depakote alone, now I take lithium and Depakote and can honestly say that keep me even...most of the time.",Anonymous
11,Lithium,Mania,10.0,,"March 15, 2012",27,"Have been suffering for 14 years with various levels of Mania.I was finally prescribed 300mg Lithium Carbonate for Bi-Polar. Skeptical of yet another wrong diagnosis, I tried 150 mg for 2 weeks. I saw an improvement after the first night. I was able to fall straight asleep and woke up without tremors or intense crazy dreams. YAY!After about the first week, my life started slowing down and I could get nothing done.I stopped taking it and the mania stayed away for about 2 weeks. The Mania has just started coming back.",John at the Falls
12,Lithium,Mania,4.0,,"November 6, 2011",20,"I've only been on this medicine for one week but the side effects are awful. I can't see straight, I stumbled when I walk, I have horrible tremors and no appetite. I'm only on 300 mg twice a day but I feel so oriented. When will I feel the positive effects?",B Donn

14,Lithium,Mania,10.0,,"June 18, 2010",52,"I found out I was bi polar a year and a half ago.  I've been on antidepressants and antpsychotic meds for that long and still felt lost & like the world was lost to me.  A month ago my new Doctor started me on lithium.  I no longer think of suicide and love to be with my family now.  Its been my savior.  Have had no side effects, except thirst.  I recommend it to anyone who is bi polar.  Life can be good after all.",Anonymous
