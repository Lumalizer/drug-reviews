1,Divalproex sodium,Mania,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 25, 2020",5,Depakote (divalproex sodium):Depakote has helped my racing thoughts and anxiety so much. I take depakote DR in the morning with my lamictal it’s great for racing thoughts. Depakote can make you kind of tired one reason why I’m on lamictal ! I’m on 250 mg will increase to 500 soon.,Anonymous
2,Divalproex sodium,Mania,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"May 28, 2020",23,"Depakote (divalproex sodium):I have taken Depakote (or a 'good' generic) of this medication for nearly 3 decades. It is very effective, has few side effects (with the exception of weight gain which is responsive to diet and exercise). This is a far more effective and moderate drug than what I was initially prescribed (Lithium-on which I hallucinated and felt terrible). I've had no long term effects to date, maintain my dosage and lead a  healthy life with this medication. Be careful when using GENERICS...some vary immensely. Let  your doctor and pharmacist know immediately if you have issues. (IE: Find the right generic or return to the original Depakote brand). Lovely and effective for a ""unipolar"" patient that I am.",gf

It has made a huge difference in my quality of life. The best part is that it’s been on the market for many, many years, is affordable and has no long term dangers.

6,Divalproex sodium,Mania,1.0,,"October 31, 2019",24,"Depakote (divalproex sodium):My mother who has a mental disability and is 56 years old was prescribed this medication twice while residing in a long term care facility under the reasons of ""behavior."" The first time she was on approximately 1000mg and it made her sleep for hours, put her in a fog, made her delay in response if she even responded at all. I asked several times for her to be taken off of the medicine and the facility was disagreeable. She was hospitalized for malnutrition and severe dehydration where I was able to convince the doctors to remove most of the dosage. They kept her on a low dosage between 125mg to 250mg. She did fine, three years later they increased the med to approximately 500 mg and put her on more behavior meds. Same thing happened, went back to hospital this time with sepsis in the blood from lack of hydration and UTI. This medicine is good for some and not for others, doctors should listen when expressing concerns and symptoms caused by this med.",Ross
7,Divalproex sodium,Mania,8.0,,"August 18, 2016",7,"This drug really helped me! I noticed a huge difference almost immediately and so did others around me. It helped me put down the bottle and focus on daily tasks along with not freaking out on other drivers with road rage as I previously would do. I would definitely recommend trying it, at least. As far as the weight gain aspect, that's kind of in my favor because it was always hard for me to keep weight on/gain weight. So I'm happy to gain some weight. I gained about 10 lbs in a week or two. That being said, it has become a chore to constantly be eating & only eating healthy foods due to my extremely high triglycerides (genetic).",Anonymous1234282882
8,Divalproex sodium,Mania,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 21, 2016",29,Depakote (divalproex sodium):Good medicine. Blood tests are annoying. I wet the bed a couple nights a week on this med because it knocked me out. It takes a while to get used to but it's overall not that bad of a med. Works well for mania.,Bipolar type Schizzoaffective
9,Divalproex sodium,Mania,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 24, 2015",20,"Depakote (divalproex sodium):Depakote is helping my anxiety and resulting alcohol abuse. It is not a ""cure"" for drinking heavily, it does make it much easier to maintain though.",Porch Honkey
10,Divalproex sodium,Mania,5.0,,"May 13, 2015",8,"It's good for mood stabilization, but I want off, I want to switch. My doctors won't listen. The weight gain is terrible, and I'm exhausted all of the time. I feel hopeless and helpless.",sockfairy

By the same token, so has lithium. I have found, though, that taking both together (by a doctor's suggestion) keeps the number of episodes pretty low. I don't know about anyone else, but sometimes when I get manic, I spiral out of control and actually experience psychosis ( which is terrible). Good medicine though...better with other medicines.",Anonymous
14,Divalproex sodium,Mania,4.0,,"April 4, 2011",104,"Depakote (divalproex sodium):So glad I had the opportunity to read how others feel about Depakote.  I have used Depakote for 8 years now for the manic side of bipolar disorder.  I have not had one manic episode since on the medication.  Great right?  I also feel as though the past 8 years of my life have slipped by and are a bit of a blur.  I was an artist, graphic designer, and had a sense of humor.  Now I feel like a numb hermit who continues to stay on this medication because she doesnt want another manic episode.",Anonymous

I have gained about 40 pounds but it is a small price to pay for the positive changes. I control the anxiety with occasional klonopin. I am working on healthy diet and exercise for the weight.,Lwacherokee

On 1000mg (combined with 200mg Lamictal) I felt ""far away"" when talking to people. I cut back down to 500mg. I began to feel it was inhibiting my creativity; sometimes I felt ""dumb."" I used other drugs to combat the Depakote from holding me back. Plus drinking on it caused depression and knocked me out. My doctor should not have put me on this medication to treat me for anxiety.",taylz
