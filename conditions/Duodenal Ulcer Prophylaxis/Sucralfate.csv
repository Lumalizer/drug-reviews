0,Sucralfate,Duodenal Ulcer Prophylaxis,4,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 6, 2020",1,"Sucralfate works okay, I'm not sure if I want to continue taking this with my  gastroparesis.  This medication causes constipation. Gastroparesis slows down digestion, having this medication just sitting around in my stomach makes me fear getting a bezoar. I l also think it slows down my digestion even more. erythromycin worked best for my illness compared to this medication unfortunately you can not be on antibiotics for too long or else it effects it's effect. Overall I'm somewhat satisfied with this, if you have trouble swallowing it just dissolve in some water and drink it that way, I used a pill crushers then I mixed it into some water, its really disgusting and chalky but not too bad.",SassySailor
1,Sucralfate,Duodenal Ulcer Prophylaxis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 21, 2020",11,"Started taking this sucralfate in addition to 40 mg Nexium x2/ day. The sucralfate drug lessened the burning sensation,  but resulted in such extreme feelings of fullness, distended abdomen, and intermittent cramping, that I couldn't even work my way up to the prescribed four times a day. Couldn't get through more than a few days. The resulting discomfort and cramping  was unbearable",Samm
