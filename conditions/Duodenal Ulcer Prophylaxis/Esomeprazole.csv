This was before breakfast as directed. About one hour later I started to feel very ill: abdominal pain, the runs and just feeling terrible.  This lasted most of the day. I contacted the manufacturer for a refund.",Karenjaninaz
1,Esomeprazole,Duodenal Ulcer Prophylaxis,1,,"August 26, 2020",9,"Nexium (esomeprazole):It is wonderful for your stomach. I was on it for 23 years, after two I started to have what the doctor called panic attacks. Blah blah blah, tests and psychiatrist later, nexium removes the magnesium out of your bones. Magnesium controls release of muscles, heartbeat, swallowing, I had become severely  hypo (low) magnesium  and no one ever caught it on a test until the last seizure. The guy in the ambulance who had seen me before said thereâ€™s something really wrong. When we got to the hospital I heard them argue with the nurse about magnesium not being in a panel, make sure you check his magnesium, the phlebotomist said, it is in a panel. It was not, 23 years of hypo magnesium and a two dollar lab test, I googled it, side effects, severe hypo magnesium. What a nightmare !!!",Dan
2,Esomeprazole,Duodenal Ulcer Prophylaxis,7,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 16, 2016",19,"Nexium (esomeprazole):I was prescribed Nexium 40mg approx 2 years ago at our local hospital after being diagnosed as having a quantity of small duodenal ulcers. No side effects were evident for the first week or so but then I started to feel aches and pains all too easily, later developing mood swings, quite extreme at times. I informed my doctor who dismissed my claims,( I do not lie! )After just under the two years of taking Nexium, I decided to take things into my own hands, I discovered Slippery Elm capsules. I am now into my fifth month of taking only one capsule a day having weaned myself off the Nexium, interspersed with Slippery Elm in the first week. I now have no side effects and with care have little or no acid indigestion.",Elfling
