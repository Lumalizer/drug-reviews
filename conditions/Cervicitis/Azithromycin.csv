0,Azithromycin,Cervicitis,,,"September 11, 2020",2,I was prescribed 1g dose of azithromycin once a week for 2 weeks - for cervicitis. The first time taking it I ate right before taking it. About an hour later I got the worst nausea of my life. Started sweating and shaking and ended up on the toilet for an hour with explosive diarrhea but after that I felt completely fine. Took the last dose a week later and this time ate a bigger meal 30 min before as the pharmacy recommended. This time 2.5 hours went by with no side effects so I thought I was in the clear. And then bam it hit me. Same nauseas feeling with sweating and diarrhea. Still awful but didn’t last as long the second time.,Mp
1,Azithromycin,Cervicitis,8.0,,"March 31, 2019",4,"I know the vagina naturally cleans itself but I figured using this new organic soap would make me feel better. After a couple uses, I felt burning and irritation. There was no discharge or odor. I went to the doc and she saw a bacterial imbalance and my cervix was inflamed and prescribed this medicine as 1, 2 pill dose of 500mg. After reading reviews, I was scared to take it due to the side effects. When the burning was unbearable I finally took them. 3 pieces of toast for breakfast with butter, and a probiotic yogurt before taking them. An hour after, I had slight cramping and diarrhea twice but nothing unbearable. I also felt nauseous and chewed on some ice cubes. If you get car sick, once the car stops, it’s minimal. That’s how to best describe it. After 2 hours, the side effects were gone as quickly as they came. I would recommend this medicine. I should see results soon and hopefully the burning subsides.",Soapy V
