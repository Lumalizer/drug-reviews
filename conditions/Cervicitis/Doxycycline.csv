0,Doxycycline,Cervicitis,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 27, 2018",5,I've been taking doxycycline for a few days now and have to say I've not noticed any side effects at all I have taken these before a few years ago and they made me feel rubbish so never stuck them out - maybe because I was taking the with metronidiazole at the time. But this time I took them I had nothing. After reading through all the bad reviews I was in two minds wether to take them at all they really put u off and needless to say everyone responds differently to medication so while I may have no side effects some ppl will probably get them all. All I can say in that respect is to give them a go and not to scare yourself reading reviews online. I would have given this medication a 10 but I'm only a few days into it and not sure if its treating my problem as yet,Anonymous
