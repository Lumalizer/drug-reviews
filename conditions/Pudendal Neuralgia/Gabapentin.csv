0,Gabapentin,Pudendal Neuralgia,10,,"August 20, 2020",27,I’ve have severe pelvic floor dysfunction and organ failure as a result.  My nerve is compressed and I’ve been in excruciating pain for almost 2 years.  I started using Gabapentin last week and I noticed the difference immediately.  I can function again.  I’m in physical therapy and this is a way to get through the pain so I can heal.  I wish I took it sooner but was scared.  Everyone is different.  I have a few side effects but not so bad  I’m tired and have some muscle aches.  I also must mention that I take lamicatal because I have Bipolar2 so I have experience with transitioning onto meds.  This might have made it easier on me.  Lamicatal was a hard one so this is a breeze again everyone is different.  It really has changed the game I even notice my inflammation has decreased.  If you match this with a clean lifestyle and exercise I think it’s worth the go bc it really helped!  Oh I was also worried about weight gain but I eat clean so I think I’ll be ok!,222
