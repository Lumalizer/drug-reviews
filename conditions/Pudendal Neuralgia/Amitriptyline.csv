0,Amitriptyline,Pudendal Neuralgia,1,,"December 24, 2021",0,"Was having severe vaginal pain that led to urine & bowel incontinence, and painful intercourse. Took 25mg and it helped while I worked with pelvic floor PT, but the excruciating pain continued leaving me severely depressed and could not sit or walk for longer than 30 minutes, My Dr. upped it to 50mg and I started having slurred speech, high heart rate up to 160’s when standing, unsteadiness when walking, severe migraines, thinking I was going to die, I looked & sounded drunk. The Dr thought I was crazy & sent me to a psychiatrist,  he said I was having bad side effects from it.thank goodness for him!!  Eventually they took me off it. A hip labral tear was diagnosed with MRI so I had laparoscopic repair of the labrum & cried after surgery because I had zero pain for the first time in over 6 months. Of course the pain came back at around 75% less, but with PT & the help from the pelvic floor PT I am so much better!! Very hopeful for a full recovery & I’m 5 weeks out from surgery.",Kitty
1,Amitriptyline,Pudendal Neuralgia,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 4, 2020",4,I have not been diagnosed but have symptoms similar to pudendal nerve pain. Genital pain was so severe I became suicidal.  Had tried numerous drugs which didn't work. Could not sleep for two weeks with the pain until I tried amitriptyline 25mg. Not perfect as has some side effects but what drug doesn't.,Jay

Left Levidor ani would go into FULL lock and I could not walk, had to take 3+ grams of benzos to unlock them... Not cool, and extremely painful!",RD
3,Amitriptyline,Pudendal Neuralgia,10,,"September 17, 2017",35,This drug saved my life. Pudendal neuralgia was making me utterly miserable. I could barely even sit down. But between 10mg and 30mg of this drug and my pain disappeared. I became happier and was able to live my life without thinking about the pain. Highly recommended for anyone with sensitive or painful nerves.,CrystalLily

5,Amitriptyline,Pudendal Neuralgia,10,,"March 17, 2016",35,"Searing, burning and gnawing pain in the groin, vagina and rectum. Add at times feeling like you have a golf  ball lodge in the vagina/rectum and that is pudendal neuralgia.Strong opiate pain killers did nothing, ditto that with another anti depressant and anti epileptic medication.But this, 20mg in the evening did, ending 5 months of hell.",Jay222
