0,Calcitriol,Hypoparathyroidism,9.0,,"January 3, 2013",13,"I have surgically induced Hypoparathyroidism. I was not monitored for many years. By the time I saw  my ENT, my vitamin D level was 780. I really thought I was dying. My Dr. said I had been suffering from vitamin D toxicity. She stopped the vitamin D and started me on calcitroil. It is a synthetic vitamin D and absorbs differently then vitamin D. It took a while for the toxicity to get better. I now take my meds differently. Prilosec 7 to 8am. Calcium/magnesium/zinc combo and calcitriol at noon, 5pm heart medicines, 9pm levothyroxine. This has worked so far great for me. Still occasional tetany. Overall better.",SheriA
1,Calcitriol,Hypoparathyroidism,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 7, 2012",8,"I've been on Rocalcitrol for about 3 years for secondary hypoparathyroidism. After initial tetany, I take 0.24 mcg every other day and about 2000 mg calcium daily. Just found out that I'm not to take calcitrol with magnesium. I take multivitamins around lunch time (calcitriol in the morning).  I'm also taking levothyroxine daily, first thing in the morning.  My serum calcium is low (7.8-8.3), Vit D is normal. I do, have bony pains and aches, remain very active.",Anonymous
2,Calcitriol,Hypoparathyroidism,8.0,,"April 30, 2010",9,I have been taking calcitriol for 8 months now. We eventually built it up until I am taking 1.25 mcg a day with 1500 - 2000 mg of calcium. It has worked very well compared to when I started out with only 25 mcg a day. I still have minor tetany problems but nothing and extra dose of calcium once in a while won't fix. The reason I didn't give it a 10 is because a lot of other medicines that different doctors gave me completely screwed me up. I see an endocrinologist for my thyroid and hypocalcemia...an ENT prescribed prilosec for reflux which messed me up and I had to stop taking it. My Gyn gave me a drug one dose one time before a uterine biopsy and plummedted my blood calcium levels for over a week...,Anonymous
3,Calcitriol,Hypoparathyroidism,,,"November 3, 2007",21,"The article does not mention that Calcitriol is not ordinary Vitamin D. It is activated Vitamin D. This is important in treatment of pseudohypoparathyroidism, in which the parathyroid gland produces plenty of parathyroid hormone, but lacks the relays containing instructions in how to utilize normal Vitamin D with the parathyroid hormone to regulate calcium level. [This is how my doctor explained this to me.]",peri12
