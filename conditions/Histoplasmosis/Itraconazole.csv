0,Itraconazole,Histoplasmosis,10,,"October 18, 2016",13,Itraconazole literally saved my life. I had a life threatening case if pulmonary histoplasmosis disseminating to my liver. Thankfully my infectious disease doctor caught it in time and started me on a pulsating dose of itraconazole while in the hospital. I stayed on a maintenance dose of 100 mg for 2 years and just now got off. I had zero side effects other than being a bit tired but it was worth it. I highly recommend this drug for histo patients.,Anonymous
