0,Imbruvica,Mantle Cell Lymphoma,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 17, 2022",0,"Imbruvica was added to my husband’s treatment for MCL after 6 months of treatment for gastric cancer. He tolerated the herceptin well but after initial infusions of Imbruvica he was hospitalized for respiratory distress with what was thought pneumonia. This drug wreaked havoc on his lungs . He left the hosp after nearly a month and was on oxygen for the rest of his life and a DX of pneumonitis caused by this drug. No more Imbruvica at that time, was treated several months w IVIG to help his O2 stabilize and it did, then his oncologist started him back on this same drug ! 3 weeks later my husband was dead from respiratory failure. I read that anyone with respiratory issues should not be treated with Imbruvica.",Wife

2,Imbruvica,Mantle Cell Lymphoma,1,,"February 4, 2020",6,"My 78 year old mom was prescribed Imbruvica 420 mg 1x per day in Jan 2020.  She’s in the hospital with a-fib, dizziness, blurred vision, skin lesions, pneumonia, upper resp infection, etc.  After reading the insert that comes with it, I checked off the side effects 1 by 1 & couldn’t believe it.  I pointed out the effects from the info insert AND the testimony via this page and said to immediately take her off.  She’s went into uncontrollable a-fib two nights ago and is literally fighting for her life.  They will drain fluid from her again. I don’t think that we should have to be the professional and solve the problems.  I’m so disappointed with her oncologist and have no answers as to how and if this will get turned around. It’s so heartbreaking that the patient is led to believe this is the fix all drug.  We were told it’s 69% effective.   So glad it works for some people but so disgusted that it’s taking people’s’ lives and leaving my mother in this condition.",Ck
