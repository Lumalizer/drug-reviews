0,Prednisone,Gouty Arthritis,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2022",0,"I experienced the most intense gout flare over the last 3 days on my right foot. It was at the ankle foot joint, the instep, the big toe, and just above the little toe. The foot was red and swollen like never seen and the pain was off the charts. I could only hop to the bathroom, and couldn't even place my right foot on the ground. My wife requested a podiatrist doc for a telemedicine appointment. My doc recommended prednsione 24 mg for 2 days and then taper it off by 4 mg every couple days. I had my first dose at 7 PM and since then been monitoring it. My ability to flex my right foot is back 80 %. I broke into a night sweat, but it felt good. For the first time in 3 days I could walk on both feet to the bathroom at 5 AM. The swelling isn't gone completely but my range of motion is back and redness is reduced. I can start to see wrinkles appear on my instep. I have taken my day 2 prednisone dose of 24mg at 7AM. this will be a split dose of 8 mg spaced out by 4 hours. no sleep problem",ram

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and pain relievers are not effective.  Allopurinol has long-term side effects.  I tried prednisone last year.  It is a miracle drug.  Yes, it has long-term side effects but it works for an acute bout of gout.  At the first sign of gout--usually in the middle of the night--I take one-20mg tablet of prednisone.  I get immediate relief after about one hour. Then 12 hours later I take another 20 mg tablet.  The following morning I take another tablet.  Then 12 hours later I take one 10 mg tablet.  By then the inflammation is gone.  I've tried to shorten this procedure, the the gout returns.",Brevard

8,Prednisone,Gouty Arthritis,9.0,,"September 27, 2020",10,"46 yrs old. Non drinker. Heart patient. Diuretics & Warfarin. Had an allergic reaction on my first dose of prednisone 50mg (2x25mg tablets). My palms & body began to itch all over & I had difficulty breathing. Ceased Prednisone. I noticed my gout pain settled after the single dose though. The next day I commenced Colchicine 500mcg (500ug). I took it for 4 days, 3 times a day, & the swelling & pain did not subside. It sent me bonkers going to the toilet  with diarrhea & began to bleed on the 4th day. Colchicine was useless as it did nothing for me.On the 5th day I went back to Prednisone, but this time a smaller 12.5mg dosage (half of a 25mg tablet) & I had no allergic reaction on this small dose. The gout swelling & pain eased within 2 hours & I was able to walk again. Pain went from 8/10 to 3/10. Prednisone IS the wonder drug for gout for me. It works brilliantly. I just have to monitor my warfarin INR levels as it's known to interact with it and make INR shoot up.",Rob

At first I didn’t know what was wrong with my foot and why my big toe was hurting so bad. I started to do a a research and all my symptoms fell under having a gout. It is a very painful disturbing feeling. Went to the urgent care the next day that’s when I was prescribed with prednisone. I thought it wasn’t going to work because they really didn’t say anything. I took the pill the next day and my foot felt way less painful within 4-5 hours and it has been the second day on the medicine and I am able to get up and walk on it now! ,dyna

20,Prednisone,Gouty Arthritis,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 15, 2020",22,"Prednisone is the wonder drug when it comes to gout. I am on allopurinol and I was on colchicine. I'm not convinced the allopurinol works at all because I still get a flare up every six weeks or so. And the colchicine was useless. My doctor keeps telling me that prednisone is not good for you - but until you've experienced gout in your toe, or ankle, or bottom of your foot (mine moves around) you really can't understand the level of pain - and what you'll do to get rid of it. As others have said here, Prednisone works very quickly - sometimes the same day. One thing to watch out for is if you're diabetic, it will mess with your sugar numbers. One day I did my sugar reading and it was 550!! So I guess it's tough on your body, but so is gout.",BJSTahly

23,Prednisone,Gouty Arthritis,10.0,,"January 7, 2020",11,I'm a 42 year old male and have been suffering from gout for about 10 years with about 3 attacks a year anywhere from 3-15 days. Didn't know what it was first few years so just suffered and roughed it out. Next 5 years I was popping advil Costco style probably ruined my stomach. Then was on indomethacin which really does nothing. Last year I had about a 2 month stretch and finally a doctor gave me allopurinol which keeps the gout away for the most part. You need to take it everyday but it doesn't harm you so it's pretty good. But during the 2 month attack I was also introduced to prednisone and it changed my life. It really makes the attack disappear. Now I always keep about twenty of the 50mg tablets of prednisone on hand and as soon as I feel an attack coming I take one and it usually gone the next day. If not it may be 2-3 days of mild irritation but it is manageable and you can still work and live. Then it is gone. Prednisone really has changed my life it is good. If you have gout get some.,Tbd

Saw Doctor on Friday morning and asked for Prednisolone after having read the reviews on this website. Absolutely amazing result, within 40 minutes could already start to feel a slight relief from the pain and by midday the pain was only dull and I could already start to bend the big toe slightly.

40,Prednisone,Gouty Arthritis,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 13, 2019",12,"After multiple gout attacks in the past few years, I have found that dehydration and minor injuries/ overworking tend to trigger flare ups in my feet and and ankles.  I have found that taking prednisone at the first sign of a  gout flare up can completely prevent a full blown attack from happening.   In the event you don’t have any pills at the first sign of the attack and it goes full blown, taking prednisone will reduce the pain and swelling by 50% in the first few hours, and you will be walking without an aid in 24 hours.  If you have a physical job, you will be back to work within 2-3  days.  Don’t let it drag on for weeks, tell the doctor you want prednisone, and if you have frequent attacks, try to get some extra for the next time you feel one coming on.  Also if you are having regular attacks you should get a preventive med  eg. allopurinol this will prevent you getting the crystals building up.",Anonymous 35yo

I already take 5mg prednisone every day. Whoever it was told me to take 50mg every day for 3 days. Then lower it by 10 mg. Every 2 days till I get down to my 5mg. Per day for my kidney. So the next time I got gout I would wait till I was in a full blown attack then start prednisone. I did not work. Like I said I don't get a little gout. So I suffered for about 3 weeks. The next time I started to get gout, I decided to take right when the pain started. I've learned thru time that I have to take it the moment it begins and I can take 50mg.
