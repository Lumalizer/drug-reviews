0,Prochlorperazine,Psychosis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 23, 2021",1,Compazine (prochlorperazine):This drug should be taken off the market.  Went to the ER with a tension headache and was given the migraine cocktail of benadryl and compazine. The nurse said it will make me feel funny for a few minutes but it will go away.  Within minutes I was slurring words could not focus and my legs were uncontrollably shaking. I screamed for a nurse she said it was normal. I thought I was going to die. A dose of Ativan was given but two days later I am still dealing with effects such as anxiety and restlessness.  Never again,EmmJay

2,Prochlorperazine,Psychosis,1,,"October 18, 2020",19,"Compazine (prochlorperazine):Was seen in the ER for a terrible migraine, I have been seen in this ER a few times for really bad migraines and I've always been given Toradol/ phenergin which had always worked. Well this time my doctor says screw what works and gave me some ""migraine cocktail"" with compazine and benadryl...about 2 minutes later I was absolutely losing my mind! I felt like my skin was crawling off my body! I couldn't sit still I just wanted to be out of my skin! I had ripped my blood pressure cuff and oxygen off and was punching the wall and jumping up and down! I've never acted like this before and have never ever ever had anything like this happen! I seriously would have run out into traffic if it meant that I would not feel like this anymore! Finally a nurse comes in and gives me ativan whch alleviates my psychosis",Anonymous
3,Prochlorperazine,Psychosis,2,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 7, 2020",15,Compazine (prochlorperazine):Received IV for headache... within seconds heart rate spiked and raced. Panic attack and out of body experience!! Awful!!,Kateo
4,Prochlorperazine,Psychosis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 21, 2018",16,Compazine (prochlorperazine):The first time I was given IV compazine I pulled my IV out and fled the hospital! The second time I actually called my nurse and told him how I felt and he said has seen it before with compazine and the doctor gave me IV benedryl which almost took the scared antsy panic feeling awake but made me a complete zombie. I will never again be a doctors guinea pig!,OahLort
5,Prochlorperazine,Psychosis,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 7, 2017",16,Compazine (prochlorperazine):After having had to take steroids for severe asthma all of my life I have been dealing with a very horrible side effects of psychosis on steroids. Unfortunately there are many people in the medical field he still do not know how to deal with that. I have learned to ask for Compazine and have been able to take small amounts to get back to a straight playing with my mental health and survive the hospitalization and the several weeks afterwards when I'm having to cut down the prednisones back to nothing. It has saved my life and has probably saved a few hospitalizations because a lot of people don't know how to deal with someone who says high doses of Cortizone make me psychotic. My long-term doctors know it but short term hospitalization Compazine saves me from all sorts of other issues that could come up that I've already dealt with in the last 64 years.,Sidly
