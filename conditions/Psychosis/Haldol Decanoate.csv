0,Haldol Decanoate,Psychosis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 16, 2019",9,"I had an involuntary psychiatric hospitalization.  This Haldol felt the same as risperidal consta, only it felt more tolerable. Still the same mind freeze and dyskinesia and extreme fear from dyskinesia, as if you are losing your mind. Also permanent changes to normal only began happening 6 mo after stopping. Permanent rise in phosphorus levels in my blood, as well as more inflammation of the parathyroids. After that my osteoporosis became unmanageable. Putting people on these substances is only justifiable if there is absolutely no way to restrain them or make them think and behave in our normal everyday human reality. Since reality is hard to judge when you are working, supposedly, then all the shy and outspoken kids who are not black get put on these meds first.",vandalized

During the 6 months she was on this, she changed from healthy and athletic to a near vegitative state. Currently she is unable to get out of bed or use the restroom on her own.",Mom's experience
