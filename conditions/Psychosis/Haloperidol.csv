In addition it takes all of the very dark thoughts away. The only issue I will say is that if too many milligrams are prescribed it will make me sleep way too much.,Rome

I haven't really had problems with the drug apart from sleeping a lot. Also I feel progressively less well now generally in my health than I was before this could be a side effect. I have a fear of people and this is family members and people outside. I have become withdrawn and socially awkward. I remain very quiet talking only to select people. This is also a side affect of the drug. My advice is that if the drug suits you stay on it. Reading the other reviews I think the drug is not suiting the other users. It has suited me for over 10 years now.,Sunflower2020

I believe they gave it with ativan each time. I know this drug has a lot of negative effects for some people, but it helped me every time, and I even took an injection voluntarily a couple of times, because of how quickly it calms me down most of the time. I was given an injection one night after getting very agitated and trying to leave the locked unit. I hadn't eaten or drank anything in days and hadn't showered. They were ready to give me IV fluids, but the day after I had the injection, I was able to think clearly enough to shower and eat.

This Haldol felt the same as risperidal consta, only it felt more tolerable. Still the same mind freeze and dyskinesia and extreme fear from dyskinesia, as if you are losing your mind. Also permanent changes to normal only began happening 6 mo after stopping. Permanent rise in phosphorus levels in my blood, as well as more inflammation of the parathyroids. After that my osteoporosis became unmanageable. Putting people on these substances is only justifiable if there is absolutely no way to restrain them or make them think and behave in our normal everyday human reality.

I had gained 120lbs on Resperdal that I wanted to get off. After 11 months my weight just started shooting up and I just kept gaining until I took myself off haldol.  I stopped gaining off and managed to lose weight . It also messed with my cholesterol and I slept over 10 hours a day on it, closer to 14.

There were no negative side effects and I lost about 15 pounds on it. It controlled all my symptoms perfectly, and really helped me with my anxiety, mild psychosis and depression. I have a PHD and really appreciate how much this drug has helped me during my schooling. I did not relapse after I went off this drug. It has been 4 years since I went off this medication and I am symptom free.",Anonj26
56,Haloperidol,Psychosis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 21, 2016",28,Haldol (haloperidol):Very very effective. Would recommend. Helpful medicine for psychosis and mania. Helps with delusions and paranoia and voices and all that comes with a psychotic episode. Only down side is a feeling of anxiety and having to move around and can't sit still for too long when on this med but it is a very effective medication.,Bipolar type Schizzoaffective
57,Haloperidol,Psychosis,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 27, 2016",14,"I was prescribed haldol when I went in patient for borderline personality disorder. Though haldol does help with my anger and agitation as well as suspiciousness and paranoia, it makes me so restless that I'm crying and would rather die than suffer like that. It makes me pace around constantly and I can't sleep because I HAVE to walk around and move my legs. I was also prescribed trileptal while I was there, which in conjunction with the haldol, makes me get such blurred vision that I'm walking into things and can't function. I stopped taking trileptal due to the side effects of taking it with the haldol and was put on lamictal which had no side effects. My outpatient psychiatrist has since taken me off the haldol due to the restlessness.",ashcole

I took it long term and have permanent damage  to my brain and nervous system! It is and old drug first used 1958!! There are so many other options out there now. Don't get started on this drug. You will become dependent on it and will not be able to stop taking it. When I take it I get really paranoid and have anxiety attacks. I can't sit still and pace all day. The worse thing about it is my mom remembers me taking it when I was 16 and it used to work good for me. Now I am 51 and don't need it anymore. I smoked some weed when I was 16 that was laced with PCP. The doctor said the PCP get's in your brain and could take decades",Anonymous

I've been on many different antipsychotics and for me the older typical ones work better than the newer atypicals. For a while I was so sick I was on both Haldol and Thorazine. That combo really helped a lot.After years of 15 mg of Haldol a day I developed pseudoparkinsonism. I would shake, I had trouble walking, I couldn't write (couldn't form the letters with a pen), and I was drooling all the time. My doctor told me I wasn't allowed to drive for 6 months. Eventually it got to the point that my neurologist began to question the pseudoparkinsonism diagnosis -- she thought I was developing actual Parkinson's Disease. I think I'm done with Haldol.",brokenmind

After a couple of weeks now I have been feeling some kinesia-related issues: sore joints, sore muscles, but I'm not exactly sure it correlates to this medicine because my activity level is varied also. It helps voices and conspiracies chill out.  But maybe that's exactly what ""they"" want! But I have felt immediately better, but am concerned about long-term effects considering the sudden onset of other symptoms.  I have been nothing but tired lately too, while I've been getting more sleep and sleeping earlier also.This is something I need to address with my doctors and it does seem like a medicine that does have need for monitoring of the effects.

It took all the nasty symptoms away. And still does to this day. This is a one amazing medicine. I'm at the point with it now, that I can barely take 2.5 mg, (5mg cut in half) without feeling drugged up though. My body became very sensitive from it. You may gain some weight on this medicine. It does give you the munchies. However, I did weight watchers on this medicine and was able to take off some weight. Again, this medicine is down right amazing.",Kazamyst
