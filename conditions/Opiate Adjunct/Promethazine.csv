0,Promethazine,Opiate Adjunct,6,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 25, 2019",9,"Surprised that this is recommended as a sleeping aid, I take it in conjunction with opiate painkillers to reduce itchiness and nausea and it works wonders on that end, but even combined with the drowsiness of opiates it still wouldn't be something that puts me to sleep.",Elle
1,Promethazine,Opiate Adjunct,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 6, 2018",16,"After fracturing my clavicle in six places in a football scrum, I have suffered chronic pain. One of the fractures (where bone is no longer present) never repaired itself. I am currently on Oxycodone 20mg four times a day, Codeine 60mg four times a day and Lyrica (Pregabalin) 300mg twice a day. Was told by my Specialist to go to the chemist and get a box of Promethazine and take 25mg-50mg four times a day to see if it potentiated my analgesia. My goodness has it been a life changer. I am almost at a pain score of 0. Also, given that it is an antihistamine, it removes the itch associated with opiate use.A solid 10/10.",M
2,Promethazine,Opiate Adjunct,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 20, 2017",10,Phenergan (promethazine):Been taking promethazine 10mg for years now to get rid of motion sickness. I can’t travel on public transport. ButThen I noticed after running out of my prescription that there was 25mg Phenergan you could buy at the chemist with 56 tablets. SoI saw you could take them to help you sleep so I started taking them with my zoplicone sleeping tablets which didn’t really work (shouldn't be taken together).  The usual dose for sleeping in 25mg to 50mg night but I have been taking more than that (which is dangereous)   . Some advice would be very much appreciated,Nicky j jones
3,Promethazine,Opiate Adjunct,10,,"January 19, 2015",34,Phenergan (promethazine):Was prescribed Phenergan with opioids after highly invasive complex oral surgery. Slept for a week & did not care if my mouth hurt. Best stuff ever.,Chicken67
4,Promethazine,Opiate Adjunct,9,,"April 8, 2013",22,"Phenergan (promethazine):I have been taking Phenergan 25mg for yrs now. I have no problem with it and it works fine for me. This is for the lady that said she was 65yr old and her daughter had same reaction. You are severely allergic to Phenergan, do not take it any more, please. My wife was prescribed it for nausea and vomiting. She started taking it and every time she started feeling like throwing up by the time I made her go to the emergency room she was on the couch with her feet raised, I mean I had to put a cinder block under the end of the couch to raise it up enough for her. She could not stand up without throwing up and I had to hold her up to get to the bathroom. She was in the hospital for a week. Now she cannot look up without getting dizzy & going to pass out!",Anonymous
5,Promethazine,Opiate Adjunct,10,,"January 24, 2012",69,"Phenergan (promethazine):I am on opiate pain medication for a back injury from a car accident, and the opiates make me nauseated and vomit. Pain doc put me on 25mg Promethazine 3X a day and it works wonders! It will make you a little sleepy, but once you get used to it then that feeling goes away. And I've tried Tigan (Trimethobenzamide) which made nausea worse. Tried Zolfran (Ondansetron) which I hated because it taste nasty and that doesn't help when you are nauseated. I would HIGHLY recommend Promethazine for ANYONE who SUFFERS with nausea from opiates or has chronic nausea!",Anonymous

7,Promethazine,Opiate Adjunct,1,,"May 12, 2009",53,"Phenergan (promethazine):I am approximately 65 years old. Post surgery I was prescribed Oxycodone and Phenergan, and after 18 hours speech became slurred, unable to form words or express myself accurately. Turns out my youngest daughter had a similar reaction to the same drug during appendicitis crisis. ",dcasr1
