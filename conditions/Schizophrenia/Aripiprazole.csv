BOY was I wrong!!! This medication was GODAWFUL!! 20 minutes after I took it I started feeling insanely tired then that turned into extreme sleepiness and drowsiness, I became weak, I had severe akathisia, was insanely angry and irritable, I had hallucinations , vomiting and diarrhea. I quit cold Turkey. Most of the side effects wore off even though I took a nap but I still feel tired like I need to nap. Never again 0/10.

4,Aripiprazole,Schizophrenia,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 4, 2022",3,"Abilify (aripiprazole):I was diagnosed with schizophrenia when I was 30 years old after experiencing significant psychosis. I was initially placed on olanzapine (Zyprexa) and although it helped considerably and enabled me to leave hospital, I suffered from side effects including fatigue, dry mouth and found it almost impossible to get motivated. I then moved onto Abilify and the difference was like night and day.I'm more sociable, active, responsible, clean and I'm able to hold down a very demanding career. I don't credit all of this to Abilify, but it certainly helped and played a huge part. I found it difficult to remember to take my dose each day and a few times the symptoms of psychosis started to return after long periods of not taking the medication. In response, I decided to go for the monthly injections and I haven't looked back!There is only one side effect that really bugs me and that is severe akathisia - Though I've found Benztropine fixes that 100%.",Anonymous

Calmed me down to the point I wasn't making rash actions and statements.Benefits: ups your dopamine in the right places, lowers it in the right places (rather than just lowering it altogether).Side Effects: Little to no side effects. There is a slightly dulled, or sedating, sensation... and at the same time, a little restlessness. But unlike when on other antipsychotics, I was able to go about my daily activities (and enjoy them).Dosage: 400 mg, also available in 300 mg injection.Ease of Use: Nurse comes straight to my door to administer. You might have to go to a hospital to get it done if you don't have a nurse.Notes: Combines well with Zoloft (sertraline). HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DRUG IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT TO STAY OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. IF YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THIS AND INVEGA SUSTENNA, ALWAYS TAKE THIS ONE.",Kyra Benjamin

The side effects alone were worse than the initial schizophrenia / depression an inability to mentally function in a healthy way. I strongly advise anybody who has been taking or is about to take any injectable Aristada consider other options. Your physical health is compromised in a way that I have never felt off of any other kind of antidepressant mood stabilizer or schizophrenia medication. They never should have approved.

I was originally started on the highest dose of Invega Sustenna but had the dose lowered and was switched over to Abilify Maintena after 5 months once my doctor was convinced I did not have schizophrenia. It completely cured me of my paranoia but left me, like many others here have described, without any emotion or motivation which is why my doctor switched me and lowered my dose after complaining. My doctor said the antipsychotic contributed to maybe 5% of my lethargy and the rest was something else- ie depression/anxiety. In the end, we both agreed 1 year on the antipsychotics was enough. I am now 1 month off and am starting to feel like myself again. I felt the need to post this because not everyone gives updates. The drug worked, but I would not want to be on it for too long.

They don't tend to tell you it takes around nine months to get this drug out of your system after one single injection. The half-life (the amount of time it takes for half of the original dose of the drug to decrease by half) is around 57 days for Aristada. For Abilify Maintena, which is a different injectable of aripiprazole, the half-lives for the 300 mg and 400 mg dosages are about 30 and 46 days respectively. So, if you happen to experience terrible side effects on the injection, such as extreme akathisia, muscle damage indicators on a blood test, extreme hunger 24/7, rapid weight gain, and depression, don't expect the effects of this injections to just magically disappear after a no-show to a scheduled injection.

Basically I was not functional and couldn’t hold a job.  All of this has gone away over the years and now I am a functioning adult.  It regulates my sleep and moods, too.  The side effects are minimal but noticeable.  I developed type 2 diabetes even though I maintain a regular exercise schedule and eat right.  Also, I have no sex drive and it kind of screws up your all of your sexual functions.  Also, beware of these medications and take them only if you have to have them.  I developed something called tardive akathisia when I tried to stop taking Abilify.

They recently switched me to abilify, and I’ve gotta say, it’s a hundred times better! I’m back to being up, I’m interested in things again, in being productive, I can even work. As for the weight, it doesn’t give me the appetite that risperidone did, nor does it mess up my blood sugar levels like risperidone did. There’s still a bit of fatigue, but my concerta, prescribed for ADD, nips that in the bud, and besides, even without the c, the fatigue levels are just nowhere near risperidone levels.

I will never be tapered off but the point in lowering is to maintain stability but at the same time control the insatiable  desire the meds give me to eat. Also to try and get back some of the energy the meds just simply take away - energy to cook , clean , and exercise. I have been trying different meds for 10 years and abilify is my preferred. After refusing those other antipsychotic meds that have literally been around forever , abilify injection seemed to be a happy medium and you don’t have to take a pill everyday (because I know I won’t). If you find being on an anti psychotic indefinitely is your reality , abilify makes things easier.

I have experienced a sensitivity to my emotions, as well as how I react to my feelings.  I really don't feel out of the normal with any ""sexual frustration""...and I wouldn't say this has increased/decreased.  I feel less anxious on the medication, and seemingly more at ease with myself when I take this medication.  It is a hard step to have people telling you that you actually do better on this pill, when half your life ago, you didn't have ""mental illness"", and suddenly you become someone else.   My weight did fluxuate when on this drug.  But I feel it was due to stress factors outside of a regular environment.  I feel if you place yourself in good surroundings and support you do much better at being the person you are here to be.  I am so much happier in life with a routine.  I feel like I only referred to enlongated periods of sleep because of depression, and events surrounding certain time frames hence thoughts, and reactions.Abilify (aripiprazole) My instant reaction from this drug is concern for my well-being.  I am nervous because I am one of the people taking this drug till the stars fade, every day to my last.  My doctors all seem to say the same thing, and that is, ""This medication is working for you"".  I do blood tests when I go into the Hospital freqently, and they are not finding anything off the charts and everything is always normal with my vitals. My thought is, how do they consider this medication works for me?  Because I am not showing side effects?  Because I am accepting?  I feel I have to hold patience, my own value, what I care about around me to help better myself mentally and my virtue.  I feel that I am just not the type of person to curbside answers to things we wonder deeply about, I guess.  I don't know if there are any people who would agree then that I should ask if there are any women who have taken abilify during a pregnancy?  Just wondering what the reaction is...  Is my question?  I am a 30 year old female diagnosed with Mental Illness starting in 2004.  I started to take Abilify 20 mg. in 2004 to present.
