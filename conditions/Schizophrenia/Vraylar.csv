Then after that I couldn’t sit still, I couldn’t think, the static in my brain was screaming at me constantly. It made me feel suicidal. I’m not saying not to try it- it may work for you. Just always have someone you can call in case things get bad.",IVR
1,Vraylar,Schizophrenia,6.0,,"October 12, 2021",3,"Hi, my son is on vraylar, for schizophrenia it seems to help him with his seizures. He use to take medical marijuana when he went out places. Now he just takes vraylar, it seems to help. No more seizures but it doesn't seem to help with his voices. Since we went up to 4'5mg he started washing his hands constantly. Now he is on 6mg. He was better on 3.5mg.He also seems distracted from the voices. I think he was better on the lower dose at 3'5 mg.",Sheryl
2,Vraylar,Schizophrenia,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 26, 2021",0,"I have Auditory Hallucinations and changed from Zyprexa to Vraylar because I was so tired of the weight gain. I gained 20 lbs. I experienced restlessness, anxiety, upset stomach, insomnia and so much more. I actually had chest pain and went to the emergency room and and they did a CAT scan and two EKGs and found out it was anxiety! I have never in my life had anxiety that was so bad that I had shortness of breath and chest pain. I had sharp pains in my chest. The anxiety was so bad for me that I had chest pains and thought I was having a heart attack. The shortness of breath was so terrible throughout the day that I could barely finish task or chores.  I know everyone is different and I wish this med could work for me because it did take away the auditory hallucinations. It made me so bloated and I barely ate. I had leg and back pain. I didn’t want to move but felt so restless. I could hardly sleep. I was on the lowest dose. Good luck to everyone that tries it. I hope it works for you. But Its not for me!",Anonymous

4,Vraylar,Schizophrenia,,,"July 9, 2021",10,"I’ve been on 1.5mg Vraylar for about ten days. I switched from Seroquel to this. The first 3 days were sort of dicey and since they’re a lot different I did have some Seroquel withdrawal feelings. But by 5 days, and for the last 5 days, I feel really good. I have taken Kratom long-term to deal with negative depressive symptoms of schizoeffective disorder, and the Vraylar has greatly lowered the extent to which I am dependent on Kratom. What I mean is now, I don’t feel super lousy between Kratom doses, and I think it is because Vraylar is boosting dopamine in areas where I had deficit in the brain.I was going to have to go on Vyvanse because of ADHD and other obvious symptoms of dopamine deficiency… but we were able to postpone that because Vraylar is making me just feel decent, and calm. I’m also losing weight and have more energy. I think this is a great medication, but it takes several days to take full effect.",Sherman

6,Vraylar,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 1, 2021",3,"I have been taking Vraylar for over six months now. My anxiety levels went way down. Also, I definitely have had less paranoia and overthinking problems. Vraylar has helped with my thought processes. However, I have had trouble staying asleep on it. I am able to fall asleep but cannot stay asleep past about 2 hours at a time. My sleep has been very interrupted on Vraylar. In addition, I have gained over 30 pounds on this medicine. I have very recently decided to go off of Vraylar because of the sleep problems and weight gain. I wish I hadn't experienced these side effects because it has helped me think more clearly and be able to function without overanalyzing everything.",Amy

I’ve tried a lot of different meds and Vraylar seemed to be the best one I’ve tried so far. I had minimal side effects (some weight gain, sweating) but after a few years it seems my body has built a tolerance to it. I’m at the point where my current dose isn’t enough anymore but the next higher dose causes extreme side effects. I guess it’s time for another new medication.",Curt

For some months I had horrible insomnia and muscle pain (at that time I got prescribed seroquel xr and imovane for sleep and against agitation), but somehow I kept going. I told myself it had to be worth it. It was quite an unpleasent experience but somehow it got me out of my „blockade. For me it’s the first medication that really not only sustained me but changed something deep inside of me – but it came at a price. Now I’m really better and hope it stays that way.",Anonymous
12,Vraylar,Schizophrenia,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 25, 2020",17,vraylar did nothing to stop the voices from my schizoaffective disorder. Ativan and Klonopin and valium works better at stopping the voices. I would get off the vraylar and find a doctor or someone else that prescribes benzodiazepines like the ones I listed in the second sentence. If you want your voices to be gone get on a benzodiazepine immediately. It relaxes your mind and sometimes produces a euphoria. I have schizoaffective disorder,LP

Did not help with hallucinations/delusions, and I actually had more hallucinations while taking the drug. I was completely zonked out to the point where I could barely move/get out of bed. Also, I have a history of seizures and I had a few dangerous seizures that could’ve put my life in jeopardy.

Continuous feeling of crawling out of my skin. I was on 3mg. This medication also gave me a permanent head twitch that is super obnoxious, so I can’t imagine what else it would have done if I was on it longer. However, for my hallucinations and my mood, it was a lifesaver. My speech improved as well as my attitude. I felt like I could finally breathe. I was only seeing blotches of color which was pleasant for me compared to my very vivid hallucinations.

I did not gain anything when I was on fewer mg.  I was also talking to people that I normally would not talk to in person and online.

23,Vraylar,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 17, 2019",84,"Vraylar literally helped me to turn my whole life around. I have been on it for 2 years now. It was a rough adjustment, to say the least. However, after finally getting on the right dosage (4.5 mg) and addressing the insomnia it caused (with 400mg  Seraquel), I am on top of the world. I was always high-functioning, but never able to fully recover for the duration of the time I was on Zyprexa and Haldol. I have fully recovered! I am now on track to finish my degree. I won’t elaborate with my restrained euphoria and uncharacteristically un-paranoid and sane outlook on life and this drug. I wish everyone had this experience with VRAYLAR.  Best to all.",CrazyCT

But today I want to share my experience with vraylar.I was taking this a year ago, at that time it helped me a little but my normal weight was 140 pounds and after taking the medicine I got to this at 175 pounds.I was very scared and not being mentally well  I  had to take it. But then I also started getting other side effects my body and my hands began to get wiggle movements which was a very horrible experience. I started reducing my dose down taking it alternate days until I stopped it. I recovered my normal weight 2 months ago. I am fine  now and I am not taking more vraylar.

Tonight I didn't take it, I'm done, but still feeling slightly nauseous and now I'm looking at the half life of this drug (2-4 days!).  It could be 2-3 weeks before I feel physically well again.

Antipsychotics worked better, but the older ones made me too sleepy, Abilify gave me ADD-like symptoms.  Latuda was pretty good, no cognition-affecting side effects, but it did sometimes give me bouts of annoying nausea.  I heard Vraylar was good at improving the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which were very similar to the effects of depression in me, so I wondered if Vraylar would work for me too.

He has been able to recommence his college classes and generally reclaim more of his true personality.  Occasionally, he experiences akathisia, in which case he takes a day off of medication with no ill effects that we have seen.  I give high praise to the scientists behind this medication.  The fact that it works in selective and adaptive ways in regulating dopamine is a tremendous advantage.

So after a few days, we brought him back to Vraylar on every other day basis.  The results from the first trial was not the same the 2nd time around. He's back on it now everyday, and his restlessness is progressively getting worse and his akathisia is bad.  So we don't know if it's because of the Seroquel break that took away the efficacy or that it lost it's magic - we don't know.
