2,Invega Sustenna,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 18, 2022",0,"Gave me my life back.  BEST antipsychotic. Tried many. Felt the most mentally healthy I had in years. Felt like I did before my illness. At first felt like I couldn't day dream or use my imagination as good. But I soon realized I was feeling inner-peace and had the clearest of minds despite that.. Used to hear voices, have obsessive intrusive thoughts, had thought broadcasting, delusions, auditory hallucinations, hyper-awareness of thoughts, constant negative commentary and was used to feeling generally ''bad'' always . This was all gone. I was 100% symptom free and was the most normal I had been in years.  Completely nullified all psychotic symptoms. Had a healthy sleep cycle too. But it's not magic so it didn't synthetically make me happy or disallow me from feeling negative emotion. I still felt pain and happiness was still rare. But for the most part I was content and loved my life again.  Only con: Lost my libido but I could still have erections. So it was a fair trade-off.",Ahadh Zilal

I believe this was my body adjusting.After a few months, and now on the drug for a few years, I have had a great experience. I still have symptoms once in a while, but not as bad. With the education I was given, before taking the drug for my first time, I am now well aware of what a ""symptom"" is. I am prepared. The drug Invega Sustenna has only improved my thoughts, speech and dialect. As I would hear voices, preventing me from speaking clearly, Invega Sustenna has given be the ability to articulate my sentences.  When I am ready, I will take either oral tablets or a 3 month injection. I think this will only help my limitations that I keep private.I no longer have headaches. I am no longer fatigued.

When I switched to another anti-psychotic, my hallucinations stopped. Five years later, I have no idealizations about people reading my mind. I am grateful I was too scared to talk about how I felt because my diagnosis could have changed. I lost my whole sense of who I was by getting injected with 150mg each month for four years.

I went from being an opinionated funny guy that could read your emotions and make just about anyone laugh, or at least smirk. I've always been very emotional and this drug sucked my soul, will to live and emotions right out of me. I'm left an empty shell of who I was. This drug is referred to as a chemical lobotomy for good reason. It shuts down all free thoughts, the voice in your head, your conscience disappears. With nothing to say, no interest in anything, no thoughts, no emotions, you as a person just about stops existing. No feeling of gratitude, accomplishment, satisfaction. Your thought process and basic decision making skills are destroyed. I've been off this drug for about 5 months now and I'm not seeing too much relief. The fear of ""being like this forever"" is a constant fear that never lets up, since this isn't a life this is merely existing. My plea and advice to you? Stay away from this medicine.",TheNugget

Does it manage your symptoms of bipolar/schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder? Yes. But myself and I believe many other people get to a point where they want to move on with their life after years of mental clarity. This drug will prevent that and prevent you from living a healthy lifestyle. It's been proven to elevate blood lipids to unhealthy levels and in some cases cause heart dysrythmia. It's a good medication to stabilize patients with the mental illnesses listed above, but I truly believe this medication should not be prescribed long term, especially if the individual prescribed it has managed their symptoms for multiple years.",Gains

I did not feel any sort of joy or happiness. Not to mention I gained at least 20pounds (I’m a very active 24 year old). The suicidal thoughts were so severe that I needed to be hospitalized. The absolute worst part is that even when you stop Invega, it stays in your system for months. It has an extremely long half life.

53,Invega Sustenna,Schizophrenia,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 10, 2018",9,"I've been taking invega sustenna for a little over a year now and for the majority of that year I had absolutely no positive or negative symptoms. Recently though, the paranoia a slight delusions have started to creep back into my mind. My psychiatrist upped my dose to 234 mg and now I can't stop eating and I'm hungry all the time. I already had a binge eating disorder but now it's infinitely worse. Also, the newer symptoms are still there. We're currently trying metformin to help with my appetite but so far it's doing absolutely nothing. I'm now thinking that I want to try switching to ziprasidone. It's supposed to be really good with weight management, but I'm worried it might not be as effective with my mental symptoms? I can't freak out because I'm working and going to school now. Back to invega though, I guess I can thank this medication for giving me my life back and making it so I can function in society. But I can't handle the weight gain...",molatoLjones
54,Invega Sustenna,Schizophrenia,3.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 30, 2018",17,"Gained over 30 lbs on this medication even though I'm eating less and I've cut out sugar from my diet. What's even more depressing is that even though I'm heavier I'm actually weaker than I've been when I was skinny and off meds. Also when I skip my injection for a week I'm hitting threes and long two's like it's nothing on the basketball court, while on the medication there's no point in going to the court. Also the results of treatment are suboptimal: I don't have friends, during 6 years of treatment I've never been on a date (which probably also has something to do with poor sexual functioning while on the medication), I stay at home all the time, am unemployed and gained the status of a disabled person. However when on the medication I don't have positive symptoms like thought broadcasting. I'm seriously considering switching the medication, I'm depressed, desperate, feel awful all the time and can't do it anymore.",kodein

So you have to couple your taking of available meds and therapy.  You have to change the way your mind works and thinks.

Diagnosed with schizophrenia back in 2011 when I told doctors I was visited by spirits at a young age. They didn't believe me though I swear on my life it is true. Anyway, I was on 150mg. Had the worst side effects you could imagine. Very high prolactin levels, lactating from my breasts, amenorrhoea, absolutely no motivation at all, pretty much glued to my bed & phone. So they adjusted my dose twice & now I am feeling a bit better. Not a lot better though I would say. They say that a schizophrenia diagnosis is something you deal with for life so I would be careful what you tell your doctors. You could be on medication for life.",h0m39url

After a 4 month hospitalization and oral antipsychotics including Zyprexa she was still totally delusional. After starting community based treatment she was started on Invega Sustana and within 2 months she was better than she has been in over 10 years. I was able to see glimpses of who she was before her brain disorder took over her life. She thinks that the shots are like water and they do nothing. Anosognosia  (lack of insight) is a very difficult issue with her so I am beyond pleased this medications ability to improve my love ones life.,just another cog

At the time I was having a episode... and forced treatment against my will. The doctor told me that it was the only drug I could take and coerced me into taking it. 432 mg shot that was nearly the twice the max dose. I didn't like it because before I was on a dopamine 2 and not dopamine 3 antagonist like this drug does. Absolute crap! Before the episode I was healthy able to run 10k in under 40 minutes on Seroquel xr.... and now I'm dealing with withdrawals and high inflammation that was .7 now 4.3 because of stupid shot. It'll make you not able to think or do your job. You'll lose interest in things like working out and being healthy. The drug is rubbish!!,Voice hearer
65,Invega Sustenna,Schizophrenia,,,"October 18, 2017",20,Well I have been on this medication for some time now.  It has helped me with the voices but to be honest you do sleep  a lot and that's the only constant this medication has.  It makes you eat a lot and as far as sex drive goes lol I won't talk about it.  I think that it depends on who you are around to make you feel depressed you have to keep in mind that it's a serious disease but with medication it can be manageable. And if you are getting too fat exercise. You will get the weight off.  Keep positive people and remember the struggle is never done we may always have a stigma put on us or a label put on us but prove the enemy wrong.

Every social worker, psychologist, and mental health doctor shouldn't prescribe this drug to anyone. It is harmful in so many ways. I took it for 1-2 years because they said: I had said that  I had bad schizophrenia. I did not have bad anything except a drug issue- which they already  knew  as they had tested my urine, but they  didn't take that into consideration. If you take this drug you will sleep away your life. You will lose you train of thought every 5 sentences. You will probably 75% chance to lose your job in a fast pace environment.When you take this drug you will lose muscles, goals, and cause you too get depressed. ",Jacob Frances Carlyle

The voices are dulled down to the point of single sentences and like only 1-4 times a day so it's a lot more managable in day to day life. Started on sustenna, went on the tablets and now on Trinza. All versions work very well for me. This medication is the metabolite form of risperdal and it's a god send.
