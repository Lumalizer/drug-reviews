0,Risperidone,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 16, 2022",0,"I was hearing voices than I went in a hospital for nearly two weeks I was out on forced medication which they can not do anything to my body without me allowing it and when I was on it my jaw started locking open and way farther than it should go my jaw was sore for a couple days this reaction of my jaw extending lasted for what seemed like 30 min as I waited for the benzotropine or whatever it’s called, I was told it’s a allergy medicine. While my jaw was getting messed up my neck started stretching side to side as far as it could go and getting stuck there. After I was out the hospital I realized my neck pain came back from my car accident but a lot worse. The side of my neck began to hurt when I would breath the most and just living it hurt a lot. I recommend to say no to forced medication.",Spencer sorenso
1,Risperidone,Schizophrenia,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 2, 2022",0,"So I started taking the medication 2 years ago. In the beginning it helps well with hallucinations, paranoid thoughts, and delusions. But it changes your whole brain chemistry, well I always been emotionless but now I really don’t care about anything. It causes me to feel like a zombie and causes me to be tired. My sex drive is normal. It causes breast milk and weight gain but I exercise now so the 40 pounds I gained is gone. And I’m sad because I wanted to gain weight. It causes anxiety tremors and causes me to move around a lot. I am different I used to be so happy now I’m not at all. It also makes me drowsy. I think about the past a lot and feel as if life is passing me by, because of the brain fog. I am 21 and hope to get off of it by the time I’m 23. But the withdrawal effects makes me worrisome I also don’t want the psychosis to come back but I think I’m good and can control and recognize it.  I miss the old me so much man. I’d give anything to go back.",Asia Wright
2,Risperidone,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 11, 2021",0,"I took this for a short while in early 2017 when I was 15 for bipolar, schizophrenia and irritability. They gave it to me at school and I felt awful! It made me insanely sleepy first of all I would randomly fall asleep at the weirdest times and even when I was walking which was freaking dangerous. I gained 38 lbs and my akathisia was so terrible on this that I would hyperventilate, scream, speak gibberish, couldn’t sit still and my mind would race, they gave me Ativan to calm me down. I stopped cold turkey. 1/10",Ivy
3,Risperidone,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 13, 2021",0,"Well my experience with Risperidone has not been quite great in fact its made life lifeless. I can't really feel my emotions right. My drive for doing basic things like taking care of my self is gone and so its my sex drive. I am having a lot of trouble concentrating and thinking with this crazy mind fog that won't go away. I have to pee all the time now, and my #2 work is always so hard now. It is either most of the time constipation, or sometimes runny explosion, never just normal stools anymore. When I eat I sometimes feel like chocking so when that happens I have to swallow another way. My vision is getting so blurry as well. I don't like going out and I don't like phones now to. Talking to people became really hard too. A lot of the time I try to think of anything it all comes out foggy or I simply can't think a single thing, before I never had this problem. I know this is used for some people who might actually need it.but I was misdiagnosed I think personally. I had a ""Minor Manic Episode"" stress induced",Matthew Knapp
4,Risperidone,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 8, 2021",0,I started this drug 3 years ago for my paranoia and anger issues. Overall it's good except for the weight gain. I started at 125lb and I am 145lb. I take 1mg because taking 2mg made me really tired but going down on the dose works best in combination with Lamictal and Prozac. I've tried other medicines but these work well together.,bpdashley

This medication made me extremely sick and I could not get off it for weeks due to me being too sick to go to the doctors.

It sure does shut me up though I get really paranoid someone wants to hurt me. I noticed it calms me down enough to go hide in the bathroom quietly without disturbing the neighbors.

8,Risperidone,Schizophrenia,1.0,,"July 28, 2021",2,"I was not psychotic when I was put on this medication. I had been hospitalized because an abusive person living in the same house as I was didn't want to admit what they had done to me. I was maybe mildly paranoid but only because I was actually enduring some strange kind of abuse that had my senses heightened. The people who embarrassingly held the title of doctor at this hospital were incredibly rude about my abuse claims and refused to let me out of the hospital until I took this medication. I did not have audible hallucinations whatsoever until after taking this medication, and in the months since starting it the voices have completely ruined my life. Before taking it. I was at a point where I might have been able to recover and improve my life but now I'm devastated and can't get the voices to stop unless I can manage to distract myself from them. The voices are cruel and have lied a lot, but have also caused me to do things that got me in trouble and have driven me to self harm.",Jo

It made me unnaturally tired, like I was fighting the effects of a sleep medication all the time! I also started overeating and was constantly hungry (like with Zyprexa). I did feel less anxious, but it wasn't worth it. Wouldn't recommend based on my experience. One note if you're autistic like me - some people report being more sensitive to side effects.

11,Risperidone,Schizophrenia,6.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 9, 2021",1,I been taking risperidone for a long time and I say its great. This medication puts me to sleep for 6 hours then falling back a sleep at 2am to 5am. My doctor prescribe me this medication for bipolar and schizophrenia. She doesn't really answer my questions though. She suggest me to take this medication for life long to help my delusions and hallucinations. I sometimes feel like someone is grabbing my hand. Last time when I was in Hawaii I saw the most scariest looking thing I ever seen and hide under my bed. Then something flew in my hand that forced me to grab I couldn't see for my self of what it was not sure and it was gone about a 1min. Glad it never happened again cause I don't want creepy things happening to me. Guys eat healthy cause you know what the cost is.,blueberry
12,Risperidone,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 2, 2021",2,"Hi there! I've come to say that this medicine destroyed my life, When I had just turned 12 I was put on this medication for early onset paranoid schizophrenia. When I started the medication I weighed 110 pounds I loved my body and had so much confidence in that aspect.... within 6 months on the medication I hit 180 and at age 13 I weighed 310 pounds I had developed an eating disorder I'm 16 now and have lost almost 100 pounds. But am still not where I was at 12 even though I'm the same height. I honestly don't remember very much from when I was on the medication but according to my family my speech was slurred, I couldn't stay awake and even often slept from 8pm at night until 2:00 the next afternoon. Only waking up to take my morning dose and go back to bed.

13,Risperidone,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 11, 2021",10,Risperdal (risperidone):I have to say that some of us have nothing better to do with our time than just writing anonymous reviews with our creative nom de plumes. I have read many of such reviews on many websites and I have come to the conclusion that many of them are reflections of the user's mind. Some say they have an increased appetite while others say the exact opposite! Strange. This is why I would like to say that Risperidone has made me gain weight because I now have a ravenous appetite; it made me tired the whole day until I was put on Fluoxetine by my shrink who took so long to tell me that Fluoxetine removes the tiredness (partly). Early mornings are the worst - it is as though I am flooded with demonic thoughts of not having to bathe. Brilliant way to start the day. Joanna Moncrieff is right about some things but she gets it wrong when she calls this drug as having a 'placebo' effect. Not really. It has removed all my delusions and hallucinations.,anonymous

This medicine actually worked like magic as both delusions and paranoia were now gone. However, I have gained weight (about 16kg) within a year of usage, cannot concentrate and think clearly, have a foggy memory and sometimes cannot visually focus on things! These factors gave me bad headaches, and they were severe during the first three months. Now it has been a year and my body is starting to adapt with the medicine, the headaches are almost gone, and do not happen as frequently as before.

In the beginning I felt tired but after one-and-a-half years I began to feel much better. The problem with this medication is that it makes you tired and lazy, especially in the morning.

The beginning was very hard as I was dealing with all the hallucinations I had been experiencing since I had consumed marijuana and smelt glue from plastic packets during my teenage years.Please stay with this drug as long as the doctor tells you.

I kept on a strict diet and didn't gain a single pound (I actually lost some weight). But despite not gaining a pound this drug caused my face and cheeks to swell up with fat and now I look like a squirrel. The fat just won't go away. I don't recognize myself in the mirror anymore.

I was hearing things and seeing things and completely lost my mind and was admitted and this is what they put me on! At the time it saved my life and made me feel normal again! But as time went on I noticed I didn’t get excited about anything anymore I had no emotions! I gained a lot of weight I went from 150-210lbs. I stopped having periods. It made me have the worst anxiety ever. I’m currently weaning myself off of it! Come to find out I had an over active thyroid and had radiation done and was told I can come off this medicine!

41,Risperidone,Schizophrenia,1.0,,"January 4, 2020",8,"The problem with this medicine is that while it is supposed to treat depression and works wonders to remove hallucinations and unwanted thoughts (some, at least), it makes one so tired and lazy that one becomes depressed in the process of being so tired! This is truly a conundrum. It made me extremely demotivated as I lost all interest in movies, exercise and study. Yes, the benefits of Risperidone are immense but I would not go so far as to say that they outweigh the side effects. The side effects are lethal. They hit right at the body and mind, and that is a big problem. Not to mention the weight gain that occurs because of inactivity and excess sleep.I find it really hard to shave in the morning! My mornings are the worst. I just can't get out of bed. Yes, it makes one sleep VERY well. There is no doubt about that, yet it is the TIREDNESS which is a big problem.

I was prescribed risperdal. I started at 2mg a day and they reduced the dosage to 1 mg. I also stopped cogentin and Prozac because of strong discomfort. After around 40-50 days of risperdal I didn't sleep as well and felt utterly horrible like a zombie- like it was torturing and destroying my brain. I came to my senses and rid myself of all medication whatsoever since it seemed to be harming my brain and not helping me sleep and have recovered from all mental illness in about 5 days and am getting somewhat less sleep but feel a lot better overall.

Other people still noticed I was ""different"" but it did wonders for both visual and auditory hallucinations, racing thoughts, and paranoia. It never could fully help my delusions though. I gained a bit of weight, but what ultimately led me to no longer take the medication was the zombifying effect it had and how I felt it changed my personality. Might be okay for others though.",BrittanyJ

Originally, I was taking it for ruminating thoughts (I call it busy head) and difficulty sleeping. It definitely helped slow down my thoughts and allowed me to sleep better.  After my son was born, I was having some postpartum depression and went back on Risperdal.  It helped with the kindling and agitation, but I did gain about 10-15 pounds on it.  When I stopped the medication, the weight fell off.  Most recently, I'm using it as an adjunct therapy to Neurontin and Trileptal for agitation and anxiety. I have emetephobia and this has been the only thing that has allowed me to be around my phobia and not have a panic attack and an ER visit.  I do not like the weight gain.",nostergaard
