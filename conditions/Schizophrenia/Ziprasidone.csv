0,Ziprasidone,Schizophrenia,6.0,,"January 29, 2022",0,I was started on ziprasidone 20mg 2x daily for racing thoughts for bipolar 1. For a few weeks my racing thoughts did not go away so my doctor kept increasing my medication all the way to 80mg 2x daily within 4 weeks. My racing thoughts stopped but I felt very drugged and like I saw life from a strange perspective. I would forget where I was or what I was doing had terrible crying and/or panic attacks. I could not drive anymore for almost 2 months cause I felt drunk. My doctor lowered it to 40mg morning and 80 at night I instantly felt more myself. Now on 20 mg morning and 80 mg at night I feel normal again. Hopefully my racing thoughts don’t return. I also have heart palpitations and very restless legs from this medication. I say tinker with your dosage to best suit you. And every time I increased it my brain felt like it shut off intermittently. I was very out of it each increase. Everyone trying to change meds hang in there,It takes time
1,Ziprasidone,Schizophrenia,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 23, 2021",0,"This medication was suggested on my sons Genesight for his MDD with psychotic features. I just knew it was going to be a game changer until.. it took away his appetite. Food is necessary in order for the medication to work properly. He also couldn’t sleep on this med. No appetite and no sleep for a person struggling with MDD with psychotic features is a no no. He was Olanzapine at first which took him out of psychosis, he slept great but did nothing for his auditory hallucinations. I will now try to find an all natural appetite stimulant and something to help him sleep. They should probably add an antidepressant to his cocktail. Maybe that will help with the auditory hallucinations. This medication could be a 10 if the person keeps their appetite.",J.B

6,Ziprasidone,Schizophrenia,,,"October 29, 2020",4,"Ziprasidone has been a slight game changer for me. Although the game is still the same, it's been able to level the playing field a bit and make things seem a lot easier. It doesn't feel like I'm taking a serious drug, it just feels like I'm taking something mild that takes the edge off. My psychotic episodes are more manageable and life is getting better. I've gained weight but I needed to gain weight anyways. I was underweight and taking Adderall everyday to now gaining weight and feeling more normal and just taking Ziprasidone (80mg/day). It's a mild drug that if you give a chance can really help things feel better.",mushrooms

I was put on this during my second hospitalization and got up to a really high dose and still didn't work but was kept on it after discharge. Caused my moods to be really unstable and led to a misdiagnosis of bipolar. Made me feel like such a zombie and made me miss Abilify which also made me a zombie but Geodon was so much worse.

I  didn't get any sleep even after taking a trazodone still didn't get but 1-2 hours of sleep that night so I decided to skip Tuesday slept like a baby that night  being cautious  I decided to give it another try 1/2 a pill on Wednesday around 7 p.m around 8:30 p.m I started having what I described as a labour pains (no I'm not pregnant) and a migraine but the pains didn't last for more than 3 to mins at a time off and on durning the night but I did get a few hours of sleep. Sometime during the night but Thursday morning I felt good enough to start some minor yard work (raking) I began to get very hot almost  to the point of stripping. Things only got worse the migraines and cramps came back along with hives and the sensation of being stung by a 100000000 all at once so here I'm am now laying in the hospital form a bad reaction from the Geodon having it flushed out of my system so I would never take this medication again ..GOOD LUCK,Kitty21

I was on Risperdal and it made me gain twenty pounds, at first I didn’t know what was going on. I thought I was just getting old. Then I got up to 160 pounds without even eating. This med made it so I can’t pee hardly at all, so if I just want to drink diet pepsi to lose weight I have to deal with water weight. I mean just how big am I supposed to get? I have to be on this stuff for life and I’m gaining about 2 to 3 pounds a week without even eating. How many times am I supposed to go jean shopping for bigger sizes? And I can’t say I trust Geodon much more.  I’ve been on it for a month now, so far I’ve lost five pounds by just starving myself as usual.

As soon as I started taking the Geodon at 20 mg my sleep started to get disturbed.  I was bumped up to 60 mg and the hallucinations have tapered off.  I still get delusions and feeling that people are talking out of my mouth as my mouth moves with words.  I had initial symptoms of restlessness and anxiety but over time these symptoms have decreased and managed.  I take Geodon with food at 5:30pm and it wires me so I can't sleep at night.  I tried taking Geodon in the morning with food, but sometimes if I don't eat enough food it causes forced drowsiness and unable to do anything but sleep for a couple of hours.  I switched to evening in case the forced drowsiness appeared again.  I found that moderate exercise 5 days a week helps with sleep because Geodon increases DHEA level and when DHEA is elevated, you have sleep issues.

Later I took Loxapine for about 3 years, but that too didn't help me with my weight concerns even though it worked well for my symptoms.  I tried aripiprazole for a while, but it didn't help with my weight, nor did it help with my symptoms.  Finally I took ziprasidone.  It has worked well for my symptoms just like risperidone and loxapine, but it has also helped me get back to my normal weight which I had before taking any medications.
