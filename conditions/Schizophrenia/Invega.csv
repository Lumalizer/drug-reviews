0,Invega,Schizophrenia,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 25, 2022",0,"I used to have extreme rapid thoughts about what people were apparently thinking about me and that people were bullying me by gossiping about me and leaving me out. Due to isolation, abuse by my ex and my funding being cut off at school, I had an psychosis episode and ended up in the hospital. I took medication including invega because I felt forced but noticed my mind wasn’t working as hard uncontrollably so I chose to stay on it. Due to stress and lack of complete support (I have some) I take my medication as prescribed but would love it if I could function off this medication, my dad was still alive, I could be the parent I want to be, I didn’t have to be in the hospital in the first place, and I didn’t have unwanted thoughts of being abused. Please, reach out to someone on meds today.",Katrina
1,Invega,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 13, 2022",0,"This medicine has been a life saver. I was on older generation anti-psychotics and they stopped responding. I began to hallucinate, I was convinced my wife was raped, went to the White House to talk to the secret service. It was a mess. Anyways, INVEGA saved my life, unlike older medicines, I do not have any negative side effects like being sleepy and out of it all the time. I have never felt better. I am having the best year of my life, working on getting my family back. I have the energy to work out 4/5 days a week. My thought is normal. I have never been happier.",Hope101
2,Invega,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 11, 2022",1,"Would not recommend this drug it made me feel less like myself and more depressed. I never had things such as voices or hallucinations in my life and all the doctors wanted to tell me was I was a paranoid schizophrenic then the doctor decided to diagnose me bipolar on top of that. Be very careful who you trust and what you put into your body. Some doctors will try to convince you that there is something defective with your brain and that you need drugs. I have been off all psychiatric medications for 16 days now and haven't gotten the invega trinza for over 3 months and I'm starting to recover. I now am going to exercise 30 minutes a day, eat right and get plenty of restful sleep. Also invega could make you gain a lot of weight, as well as make your emotions so dulled down that you'll forget what you were like before. It should be illegal to use this drug on people especially when there's no real evidence that a person needs the drug.",Mental
3,Invega,Schizophrenia,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 1, 2022",1,"I hate this because my last dose was in July 2020 and I still can't feel the effect of ADHD stimulants anymore. The notion being presented by the commentators here that this drug has long-standing and even semi-permanent effects after discontinuation are absolutely true. In the quest to temporarily limit my dopamine receptors, Invega ended up destroying it, with no appeal.",Blah
4,Invega,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 17, 2021",0,Hello dear people.Do not take any mental drug in the form of an injection!!! Just never!! Regardless which mental drug.I am taking Invega pills for years. For me it's GODSEND. I am over empathic highly sensitive and emotional to sickening degree and this medical blocks that mostly. I would be as good as dead without it. It also reinforced me mentally.  Thanks to Invega and an SSRI (escipalotram 20mg/ Antidepressive ) I can live as a healthy person. Even many doctors do not notice that I am a mentally disabled. This medicine should be made available for EVERY person on earth to block over empathy; especially for males since women are definitely not interested in an empathic guy.,XxX( male)
5,Invega,Schizophrenia,2.0,,"November 17, 2021",2,"Invega ruined my life until I actioned by myself the switch to another antipsychotic. Any side effects mean that the meds are not really working to treat the mental illness. I stopped sleeping for 3 years straight and gained so much weight I looked like a mutant. My body and face. I lost both my menstruation and sex drive so it was like sterilized. Well I stopped living my life obviously. I couldn't even get out of bed for those years. And I was totally going crazy. Much worse than before my diagnosis. I believe my psychiatrist gets kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies so doesn't really prescribe as a doctor. My new meds, just another antipsychotic still leave me with chronic insomnia but I fought for sleeping pills by now. And the rest, I am back to ME all the way.",Woman

Would say why did you need to give this to a 40 year old with no history of mental health issues. Would have sorted myself out if I was told that it was highly possible that it was due smoking too much marijuana and this can cause psychosis.,Bob
7,Invega,Schizophrenia,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 6, 2021",2,"I have taken Invega for 10 years on and off. It does stop the mood problems and psychosis, but at what cost? I'm 334 lbs and was 250lbs when I started. I have lost sexual function. I have night terrors and for years I have had panic attacks. I am insomniac because sleep is the worst. I sleep two hours and wake up. Then I wait till I'm tired again and sleep. I haven't slept 8 hours in 4 years. I'm diabetic now. This ought to tell you how bad schizophrenia is--I still take the medicine and never plan to stop. I'm about to get a Bachelors degree in two months and have had straight A's for a year.

8,Invega,Schizophrenia,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 30, 2021",0,"My son is autistic and has bipolar 1.  His manic episodes were through the roof. Within a day of taking this on 3 mg., he turned back into a sweet, loving person. It worked for about 3.5 years, then slowly stopped working. We increased it to 4.5, then 6 mg. But it just wasn’t working like it used to.  That is my only complaint is that it stopped working after time.  Maybe all these drugs do. I don’t have enough history with the others.  We tried Vraylar - he started hitting his head and became explosive, so we tried to wean him off of that to Seroquel and on the third day we had to hospitalize him for the first time. They put him on Geodon, but I’m concerned about its heart rhythm side effect. Hoping to switch to Seroquel. He’s an ultra-rapid metabolizer so Abilify and others don’t work for him. I’m hoping he can go back on Invega at some point again because nothing worked this well in calming him.",Tyler

I am unable to think and retain information, I get no joy out of music, food, books, or TV anymore. I am a visual artist who no longer has inspiration. I can barely remember my characters or their stories. I can't think or write with any regularity. I can no longer laugh regularly or feel most emotions. It has been a miserable experience. I can't imagine what kind of sadism it takes to create a drug that makes people so empty inside. I am missing memories and all kinds of pieces of my old self. I can deal with not having a sex drive. I can't deal with the rest of the side effects. I want my brain back.",CianRhapsody
10,Invega,Schizophrenia,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 3, 2021",0,paliperidone has worked both wonderful and not so wonderful. It calms me down enough to not disturb my neighbors when I  have anxiety about  bad memories. It has lowered blood pressure 62/42 yeah!!!! That's pretty good. The nurse says if I keep keep smoking it will go up. It gives me some headaches about two to three a week but it does shut me up. It definitely mellows me out. It helps to keep that demon who is trying to hurt me away! Hooray ra ra hooray!!!!  I spikes my blood sugar though,Nobody

It has been so hard to lose the the the weight. I don't take the meds anymore and I'm still trying to lose the weight and it cost me other health problems on top of this. I would not wish this this medication for anyone. I did not feel better on it at all. In fact I felt dizzy and was sleepy and all I wanted to to do was eat.

16,Invega,Schizophrenia,1.0,,"February 8, 2021",9,"First injection made me very sleepy, I slept a few days. Noticed the volume of the voices were lower. I still heard voices for the first 5 months. Just on a lower volume. At the 6-7 month phase they went away completely and now come back when I’m feeling strong emotion. The Invega injection made me very unmotivated. I didn’t clean, I didn’t look at my phone, I became disconnected from everything including my child. I did not feel love, or motivation to keep going, my thoughts were taken away from me. My high on life had faded away slowly. I do not recommend this injection it will take your life away. I’m off this injection for 2 months now, and I’m starting to gain back a social life, motivation to clean, and motivation to be me again. I feel better then ever. But I do still have voices on a very low volume so I use sound from the tv and music to take them away. So I don’t hear anything. Please stay away from most of the antipsychotics!",Missk
17,Invega,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 20, 2020",10,"On this for Bipolar 2 and I can honestly say this drug has made a huge difference in my life. I'm on 4.5 mg daily. I could use more, but I experienced lack of vaginal sensation when I took 6mg. I have more energy, my suicidal ideation is the lowest it's ever been.  I do feel a little foggy sometimes, but I'd rather deal w that than my symptoms. Within the first couple of days of taking it, I had the most productive days I had in months. I actually keep my place a lot cleaner now. It's easier for me to do things like go to work and meet goals. My breasts did get a little bigger like just enough to need a bigger bra but small enough that the bigger bra is still a lot to big lol I have not experienced lactation like a lot of others have. I do experience vaginal dryness as well however in my opinion, the positives to this drug out weighs the negatives. I love this drug and recommend it.",Kodi87

Made me forget words, feel stupid, impotence, erectile dysfunction, sexual problems overall decreased ambitions, decreased confidence, felt swollen, my life turned upside down.

19,Invega,Schizophrenia,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 23, 2020",13,"This drug did completely get rid of the voices in my head and the delusions, it also helped with my physical health a little bit. I had a colon problem which led me to smell very bad all the time, but now I smell like a normal human being after the first few months of being on the injection. Also, my sleep is great. I will say that weight gain is to be expected, this drug will give you an uncontrollable appetite and will probably cause you to gain 40-60 lbs within 6 months. I have also experienced trouble with speech and I feel a little less smart in general. This drug has caused me to have akathisia, I simply cannot sit still or stand still. My vision has seemed to be affected as well, when I don't eat for a while, or when I eat too much, or when I exercise I seem to get black shadows in the corners of my eyes or blurred vision. Overall, this drug is beneficial for people with schizophrenia but it will cause weight gain and a few other side effects",Jay

Terrible vivid nightmares that seemed more real than reality. I was wondering if I am dreaming or is it real all the time. My mind was empty. My muscles were in pain, I couldn't properly move my body because of ""hard"" muscles. I had a feeling of being pregnant - smell and taste changed, I had contractions and I produced milk.

However, soon after taking this medication I developed a depression. My depression has varied from severe mental agony for entire days to its current more anhedonic state. It is debilitating to say the least. After holding on for five months I will try to switch back to Seroquel which in the past has left me more stable while also getting rid of any symptoms related to psychosis.

This drug blocked all my mind wandering that I loved so much.  I was given a 6 week course of ECT and put on 75mg dothepin antidepressant and invega upped to 6mg.  When the dose was increased to 6mg I had heart palpitations and couldn't sit still in a chair from stiff joints and was constantly falling asleep.   My psych blamed invega lowered my dose to 3mg and increased my dothepin to 150mg.  I was still robotic in thought and movement but I could lead a productive life.  My head did feel very dry and I was in survival mode though.  I started having 2000mg fish oil capsules a day and my thoughts became fluid and so did my joints and movement.
