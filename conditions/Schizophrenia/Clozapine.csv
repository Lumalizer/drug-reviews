0,Clozapine,Schizophrenia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 27, 2022",0,Clozaril (clozapine):This is the only antipsychotic that worked well with few side effects.   Only side effect has been Tachycardia-treated with beta blockers.    Almost complete recovery after 2 months. Just needs tweaking to get a bit more improvement.  Voices and hallucinations gone. Personality slowly coming back. Motivation much improved.    Organisation skills greatly improved.    The worry is that as a daily medication it can be forgotten and decline is quick without so needs someone to check tablets are taken.   This is after 5 months use but improvement came after one and half months use.   Try not to smoke.,Mother75

2,Clozapine,Schizophrenia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 7, 2021",0,"I have tried many antipsychotics with little results for my symptoms improving. Loxapine was one that worked for me and I was on it for about a year. I figured I'd try clozapine because I heard it's the best one.After spending 3 months in the psyche ward to try clozapine, I really must say, it worked almost like magic. Within a few weeks I was feeling much better. By the end of the 3 months in hospital my voices were very quiet and in the background. It improved my sleep and even helped my delusions and anxiety/paranoia a bit. I am very happy to say, my schizophrenia is much better and easier to deal with.",Wowdrug

8,Clozapine,Schizophrenia,10.0,,"February 19, 2021",11,"I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in 2019 after four psychotic episodes that required hospital care. I tried to fight schizophrenia and depression without medication for two years. I didn't want any medication because I was struggling with terrible unwanted side effects like akathesia. Psychiatrists put me on : Zyprexa, Lithium, Attivan, Abilify, Rexulti, Valium and Invega Sustenna. Like I already said; it took 2 years to find the right medication for me. I've managed to find Clozapine with the help of Drugs.com reviews. My doctor was also aware of Clozapine. We both agreed to try it as a last resort and it saved my life! So far I experienced fatigue, weight gain, drooling, chest pain and altered libido. I also take Lamictal (150 mg) to stabilise my mood and prevent a depression relapse plus many other supplements like Bacopa monnieri. I am now happier than ever, able to work a 40 hours/week job, physically/socially active and able to lose weight.",John

10,Clozapine,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 27, 2020",12,"Well my sister has been on Clozapine for several years now. She is no longer her former self. Completely different personality. Zones out, underproductive, forgetful, and unable to do much for herself. Her life is a shell of what it used to be. Put on so much weight, but above all that, no quality of life.  It makes my heart break. No one should lose themselves in the light of mental illness because of a drug. It's not even the schizophrenia that's done this. It's Clozapine. I feel like I've lost her, I miss her. With Clozapine it is like literally sitting there watching someone who has taken valium. Zoning out and forgetful. She doesn't deserve this. At least when she had schizophrenia with no medication yet, she was her  self. I want her back!! This drug needs to be lowered or changed, hospital are just leaving her on it after years. It's no life at all.",Barbiegirl

14,Clozapine,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 15, 2019",30,If it wasn't for clozapine I would be in a secure hospital or dead. I  have epilepsy and inter-ictal psychosis organic. My seizures are controlled by topiramate. Age 19 I had a lot of seizures which left me afterwards  very pyschotically unwell. Had anti pyschotics. None worked. It was thought at the time I would  never be well enough to live in the community. Clozapine was tried as a last resort and though initially I had a high heart beat and some drooling. It all settled down. Fairly soon. I was on topiramate initially at 450 mg alongside clozapine. It was working and six weeks later I was discharged from hospital.  I accept I will always have to be on it. As  on two occasions tried to come off and became psychotic again. I  am on 325 mg 25mg day and 300 night alongside topiramate. I am under a neurologist and  psychiatrist. I get regular health checks don't smoke or drink. I don't know what I would do without clozapine.,Bear
15,Clozapine,Schizophrenia,6.0,,"July 29, 2019",33,My son was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 17. He was even hospitalized for 3 and 1/2 months because of this horrible disease.  He tried many different medicines and none worked until clozapine. Clozapine helped him a lot with the voices but the weight gain is horrible. He gained over 100lbs in 6 months! Now he is depressed and won’t leave the house because of his sudden weight gain and is refusing taking the med because of it so now we are back to square one.

I spoke with my Mother and she worked to get this drug for him. He was so normal on it, like he woke up and was himself again. He was able to live in an apartment and work a 40 hour job.

What a life saver, I wish I took this to begin with as I strongly believe voices would be 100% gone by now, anyway, they are pretty much there 5-15% of the time now. Blood tests aren't an issue for me. Used to it now but shoulder area of shirt and pillow are pretty wet in the morning from drooling.

He was in a constant state of his own reality and heard voices on a regular basis.  Seroqel, Zyprexa, Invega, and Ability did nothing for him.  His psychiatrist prescribed Clozapine as a last resort.  I won't allow his dosage any higher than 300mg per day for now since the side effects worry me.  This drug has been a lifesaver to allow him to participate in the regular world and quiet the voices where he can focus on real ppl.  It makes him drowsy so he takes it at night.  Weight gain is significant but most antipsychotics will do this. Regular blood monitoring to make sure his WBC stays normal.  So good, so far.",Dmom

25,Clozapine,Schizophrenia,3.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 24, 2018",14,"This drug almost killed me.  My white cell count was so low, I was getting fevers every other day and I had severe diarrhea for almost a full year.  When I finally sought medical help no one could help me.  I asked to stop the drug and I slowly got better.  As much as this drug is praised, it is unnecessarily overprescribed.  In some European countries it is banned,  and for good reason.  My quality of life was horrible on this drug.  Gained weight,  constipated once for a whole week,  I could not find a good job,  and developed extreme OCD that dissipated as soon as drug was stopped.  I do not recommend. You are better off turning to your local charity organization for help than getting involved with any doctor that willingly prescribes this without properly assessing your situation.

Finally she was put on Clozapine, which helped her so much that she even managed to graduate with a BA.  There are negative side effects such as constipation, weight gain (which she is fighting successfully with Weight Watchers), and her voices do break thru once in a while and some psychosis sometimes.

I went on invega  and then Risperidone but they both made me feel like a zombie because I had to be on the highest dose. I had akathisia and I was restless and tired at the same time and just wanted to sleep all day but physically couldn't  and very depressed. I would hear voices every night when it would wear off. I had intrusive thoughts also. My doctor suggested trying 250mg Clozapine but I was scared. It is a miracle drug! The outside voices went away and the thoughts that weren't my own! I have no side effects and I am happier now! After a year you only have to get your blood drawn once a month. Worth it to have my life back!,Videokitten

Every other med combination had been tried for 5 years during which she was constantly psychotic, in and out of the hospital. That was nearly 3 years ago and she improves in  tiny increments every day. We have learned a great deal during this 8 years: that most psychiatrists don't understand how to treat mental illness because most they don't believe in neurotransmission disorders.
