0,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 24, 2022",0,"I have tried trialed this medication for 8 months and previously had a raving review about weight loss and more manageable symptoms. Problems have risen since my initial review that have changed my opinion. It costs $2000 out of pocket and is not available in generic so it is also not the most accessible. This medication raised my prolactin levels outside of normal range, resulting in visible hair loss (I am a young woman). Raised prolactin levels can also affect fertility and I could not tolerate either. Taking this medication while in school negatively impacted my schedule and caused me to have to take a medical leave. Immediately after taking the drug, I am extremely exhausted and cannot think. I could not dedicate evenings to getting school work done as needed, due to slow cognition and lethargy immediately after taking. With this medicine there is initial weight gain & then eventual weight loss, but if you miss a dose or doses, the weight comes right back.",Liv
1,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 15, 2022",0,"My son who has bipolar with some schizophrenic symptoms (schizoaffective) did not do well on this medicine.  He was hearing people calling him insulting names 24/7!  I took him back to his psychiatrist yesterday.  He put him back on his original medication, Risperidone, and so far, the voices have already stopped.  Thank God!  Caplyta. Did not work for him AT ALL!",Phil

3,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 18, 2022",10,"I have had a very positive experience with Caplyta so far. I have been on several antipsychotics that worked but had side effects that were not tolerable. On the first day of taking this, I had dry mouth and a headache. Since then, I have not had a single side effect. After a week on it, I feel great. I haven't gained weight on it which is a good sign. I have more motivation and am sleeping normally after having those problems on Vraylar. My mood is also not flat like it was on the other medications that I had been on previously. I am not normally the person to write reviews but I saw all of the bad reviews and thought that maybe by sharing my experience it would help others. Maybe many people don't write reviews unless they have a bad experience? I am not sure but my experience on it has been very good. Would recommend to anyone who couldn't tolerate the side effects of other antipsychotics.",Caplyta Fan
4,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 13, 2021",22,"I would often complain to my psychiatrist about how many meds I was taking for my schizoaffective bipolar. He'd always assure me that brains and meds are like locks and keys; sometimes you only need one key to open the lock, and other times you need multiple keys at once. I'm a multiple keys type of girl. I've been on a myriad of psych meds, but slowly found out that I needed several at once to keep things steady, but I still felt ""crazy"". I was angry, extremely paranoid, sleepy, hallucinating constantly, and I felt so unsafe in the world, like everyone was out to get me. I read about a new med coming out and begged my psychiatrist to let me take it. ""Okay, we'll see how it works for you,"" he said. It was slow at first, or so I thought. I didn't realize the small changes that were happening. I became less angry, less paranoid. I stopped hallucinating. But most of all, I started to feel happy. I never realized life could be so peaceful.",Happy
5,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 7, 2021",1,My experience with Caplyta has been terrible. I was on Latuda for years and my doctor thought I should try Caplyta because of the wonderful reviews she had been getting about the drug. I have had breakthrough psychosis on and off now for about three months. I never had breakthrough psychosis with Latuda. I think for me Latuda is the drug that help that will help me the most. I've also been Prescribed Viibryd for anxiety. I do not like Viibryd either as it causes me very restless nights being unable to sleep.,My 3 dogs
6,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 13, 2021",3,I was put on this for my psychotic disorder. It was very easy to go on this med.  The only side effect was sedation. I take it at night so it helps me sleep but I don't feel drowsy in the morning.  There is only one dose so you don't have to figure out the right dosage to treat the condition.  That made it much easier to go on. Great med.,Lib44
7,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 10, 2021",17,"Absolutely GODSEND!!! I have been on every drug for my schizophrenia up to clozapine and nothing worked without making me an emotionless drooling void. I have been on Caplyta for about three months and my quality of life has improved exponentially. My schizo was so bad I had by and large stopped all hygiene, never left the house, and was consumed by paranoia and voices that no one but me could hear. I am now extremely hygienic, I have set routines and schedules again, I am able to go out in public, I converse with complete strangers every day, and I am so optimistic and happy again. I am on no anti depressants anymore, my anxiety is much lessened, and am happy again.",BubsDaddy
8,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 6, 2021",9,"The main psychotic symptom I experience is paranoia. I have cycled through 9 different antipsychotics until I was finally prescribed Caplyta. Past drugs caused extreme weight gain without overeating (40 lbs), major sedation, restlessness, tongue swelling (allergic reaction), akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, impulsiveness, compulsiveness, and terrifying depersonalization & derealization.On Caplyta I experienced extreme sedation and difficulty being productive in the beginning. After 2 months, the sedation went away then I could get tasks done and wake up early. After 5 months I lost 13 lbs without trying. My paranoia is minimized and manageable. This drug is one simple pill that must be taken once a day with the only minor inconvenience of having to be taken with food.",Liv
9,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 31, 2021",4,I am trying this medication for the second time.  I was experiencing being off balance and dropping things a lot! I had a couple embarrassing falls. One in my huge driveway! People actually stopped their cars to check on me. My husband seems to think this med helps me more than hinders me. So I'm back on this med. It needs to help me because I'm at my wits end!!!!,Dreamer4real
10,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 28, 2021",6,"I had double vision, and it was very uneasy and hard to walk or stand up I felt like there was 300lbs on my shoulders my neck muscles were very stiff and hurt my legs felt like rubber and my eyes were blinking constantly really fast.",Allanhat
11,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 16, 2021",16,"My 21 yr old son's been on this med for Bipolar 1 with psychosis. He has been on it for 3 weeks now after coming off Vraylar, which was great until it stopped working as well (but did cause weight gain). So far the Caplyta is not doing as well, and he's sleeping or about to fall asleep all day. He looks and acts drugged, with slurred speech at times, like he did when he was on Seroquel. And he's having sleep paralysis more often with increased hallucinations at night. Should say he's also on Depakote, Buspar and Lamictal (generic forms) and Ingrezza for muscle spasms, so I'm not sure if there is some interaction or overdosing going on. We talk to his N.P. this week, and he wants off it, when he's awake enough to think about it.",MomInTN
12,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 5, 2021",21,"Caplyta was the most normal feeling treatment I have ever taken. The only problem is that I am very treatment resistant, so after about a month it quit working. It would work if I would triple the dosage but you’re not supposed to do that lol. I don’t know what to do anymore, the only treatments I haven’t tried yet are the ones that make you sleep twelve hours a day.",Curtis
13,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 8, 2021",7,I have been on this drug for about a month and half for me it is the worst  med I have ever taken. It literally felt like part of my mind was shut down and would not work at all,oddhead
14,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 2, 2021",19,Well I was previously on a combination of vraylar and risperdal but I changed the vraylar to caplyta because vraylar was causing weight gain. So far on caplyta I have experienced little to no side effects and I’ve lost 3 lbs within my first month of taking the drug. One thing I’ve noticed though is that I haven’t been getting my period. Not sure if it’s because of the Caplyta or not but I’m not complaining lol,Muggyjug
15,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,10.0,,"March 22, 2021",18,"I'm on this for Bipolar 1 & Schizoaffective Disorder. The only downside I can say about this drug is that it has caused Prolactin to go very high. I just got my levels back and it was 95. Normal levels are 4-23. This medication has caused galactorrhea (milk production)So a word of caution to anyone trying out this drug, it is new and has only been around for a year and even does mention right on the site that it has caused Prolactin increases. So please watch out for this and get checked for it if you think it may be an issue. Even if you are not actively leaking, if you check, there may be lactation. Please be aware, and I hope this helps someone.",Anonymous
16,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 13, 2021",6,"Gave it two weeks I was hoping the side effects would go away but they only got worse.  Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, restlessness, fatigue. It made my schizoaffective disorder somehow worse, I know this because my symptoms are usually stable.  I started pacing around the house and my ""paranoid senses"" were heightened. Therapy seems to help a lot more along with medicine. Therapists give you the tools and skills to deal with most episodes you will have.",smokey76
17,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 23, 2021",25,"I started on this medication a week ago for Bipolar. I was worried after reading all the bad reviews but decided to try it because my doctor always has samples so it’s free and I’ve been off all meds for six months and things eventually got bad like they always do. Also I don’t normally have side effects from medicines except for lithium. First night, very sleepy but surprisingly not as bad as other antipsychotics and I’ve been on several over the years. Within a few days I felt the paranoia and delusional thinking subsiding. I’m much more calm feeling. I want to do things again. I also started Wellbutrin XR. I hope things continue to improve over the next several weeks.",MsBoom

20,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 28, 2021",18,"I was only on Caplyta for two days, and it’s the worst medication I’ve ever tried. The side effects were absolutely awful-I had insane dry mouth-I was so lightheaded that I felt like I was going to fall every time I stood up-I was nauseous and incredibly anxious, to the point where I had anxiety attacks that lasted up to 4 hours-I couldn’t regulate my body temperature, so I was burning hot and freezing at the same time -Within the 2 days, the voices became a lot worse and it was very overwhelming It was an absolute nightmare and honestly borderline traumatic for me. If you’re sensitive to medication, I wouldn’t take Caplyta.",Stitch

22,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2020",36,"I felt burning the first day on Caplyta and it continued the whole time.  Hair loss started in about two weeks and that was before the medicine became really intense.  I couldn't stop talking, couldn't sleep, and couldn't stop moving. My throat became very sore from talking so much. I felt like I had to walk to settle my mind.  I could sleep for about an hour or two a night for about the last 3 weeks on the medication.  My hallucinations became terrifying to me. This was like a whole other level of my nightmare life.  It was like living in an insane world.  Watching TV was terrifying. I felt like I was being hunted by people at night.  Urinating became painful and I felt like I wanted to scream. There was difficulty in urinating from the pressure. I was also hallucinating more. 6 1/2 months after stopping the medication, I'm still trying to recover. It was a nightmare.",TH
23,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,1.0,,"November 17, 2020",23,I had a stomach ache for 4 weeks after I started Caplyta. I had dry mouth so bad I had open sores in my mouth and on my tongue. I was also extremely tired all the time. I had to spend a lot of time in bed. Worst of all it didn't work for my schizophrenia. I developed paranoid thoughts. I discontinued it and went back on Olanzapine and felt better in about three days. Caplyta was not a good drug for me. I was hoping it would be. I am disappointed.,No name
24,Caplyta,Schizophrenia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 2, 2020",51,"I'm on Caplyta for schizoaffective, alongside lithium. It has helped me so much! I was struggling with a lot of intrusive nonrealities and visuals, delusions relating to fears and paranoias, disconnection, overwhelming conversations in my head, and severe mood swings, which had been affecting me for years. It has gone a long, long way in helping these issues.My first week was a bit rough but not overwhelming. First dose left me extremely drowsy so I decided to take it in the evenings before bed. Subsequent days I did feel a bit of dread as it set in. 6 days in, I felt like I was able to move it to the mornings and my body was getting used to it. Even before then it helped me with my symptoms a lot. I really have to take it with food.  I've had to eat fuller breakfasts since getting on it or else the drowsiness comes back but its easily preventable.This medication has really changed my life and I'd encourage anyone trying it to wait a week unless the side effects are too severe.",deltarae
