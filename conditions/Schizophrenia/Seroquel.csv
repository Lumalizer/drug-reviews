I don’t have a diagnosis, I just know I was feeling bad from the moment I opened my eyes in the morning to the bedtime. I mean, I had the feeling I was in danger, stuck on the hyper vigilance mode all day long, and I was so tired. Since one week I’m on seroquel 300mg, I just feel lighter. My body isn’t this huge bunch of flesh and dark thoughts anymore. I can breath again !? Light side effects for now, I hope it will last ! Suicidal thoughts are fading away slowly and that’s pleasing.",Pangoline
1,Seroquel,Schizophrenia,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2021",2,"I was prescribed this first in 2008 then again in late 2012 early 2013 when I was 15. I took the smallest dosage both times for schizophrenia and depression and I felt like sooo bad on this!! I was insanely sleepy, dozing off in class, at lunch, in public, I gained SOOOO much weight and my stomach was literally a bottomless pit! Otherwise it got rid of my symptoms such as mania, anxiety, paranoia and anger but still. I’m on something way better now",Hotpinkcookies

3,Seroquel,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 1, 2021",4,"This saved my life. I take 400mg at night and am still working on finding the right dose, but this drug is the most helpful I have ever been on. Because of my psychotic symptoms (I had an undiagnosed, psychotic disorder) I was unable to live my life, but this drug saved me. The only downfall is it makes me sleep a very long time and it has caused some weight gain, but the benefits far out weigh the side effects.",Alexa
4,Seroquel,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 23, 2021",18,"In the four years I've had schizophrenia I've never really had relief from symptoms despite much effort in finding a good medication and numerous hospitalizations. I honestly felt like a hopeless case seeing as I've been on Invega, Zyprexa, Abilify, Clozaril, Rexulti, Loxapine, and Resperidol. Every single one of these medications made me extremely tired. I would sleep for days only to get up to have a meal or use the washroom in some cases I was sleeping 23 hours a day.. but then I tried Seroquel XR. Within days I started feeling alive again and didn't even get the sleepiness side effect. I feel so calm and clear on this drug. I now have days where I'm completely in reality and not a thing could bother me or upset/trigger me. This medication was a literal life saver, an unexpected one too.",wordsguy

I have schizophrenia and when I first took this back in middle school I don't remember any negative effects but weight gain I ended up being 150 lbs at 5'1 in March of 2009 at age 12 so we stopped it and I lost 17 lbs. in 2013 I was prescribed this and good God I felt awful! I couldn't keep my eyes open at school, I had severe akathisia and was ravenously hungry! I knew it was the medicine because I wasn't dumb so they took me off. I ended up going from 145 to 190 in a damn month all because of this crappy medicine. This, haldol, risperidone and latuda are the worst antipsychotics ever gave to me. I'm on depakote, Zoloft and zyprexa now and no negative side effects except for nausea. Never taking seroquel again",Chocolate overload

I was given the drug for multiple suicide attempts because of a severe depression.At day 8 I had the worst manic episode I have ever had in my life, I had no control over what happened and I had trouble breathing.My mild Schizophrenia have since worsened and I experience more hallucinations than I ever have before.This drug is NOT recommended in my opinion.",ITrustWeedMore
7,Seroquel,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 4, 2020",50,"I used to take this drug Seroquel for 7 years. The only side effects I had was sleeping too much, no way to wake up in the morning and ""still sleeping"" for 1st hour of being awake. Once I threw up breakfast because my body was just not working yet. And I was always putting guilt on me, because I didn't know that this is pill side effect. I used to think I am lazy, because I couldn't wake up. When having job, I always needed someone who woke me up, because I always turned off the alarm unaware, while sleeping. Only now when I changed pills and can normally wake up I see that I am not lazy and I am very happy for that fact! Another side effect was muscles cramps in legs - when I went to bed, I couldn't stay still, I had to move my legs because of some weird ""muscle tightens"". This happened occasionally. The side effects were not so terrible. It didn't do any harm to mind and emotions.",123

He started experiencing psychosis/auditory hallucinations at age 18...so bad he would yell and get very angry.  We have started Seroquel, on it over 2 months now, some improvement but not great.  His doc has now upped it from 25mg and we are now 500 mg.  Along with Mirtazipine and Ativan for sleep.  Hoping we can stay ahead of of his episodes instead of chasing them.  I’ll give an update.

10,Seroquel,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 27, 2019",88,I started 100 mg of Seroquel after Abilify failed at managing my symptoms.  On Abilify I was waking with constant anxiety and restless leg syndrome.  Once I started taking Seroquel anxiety and restless leg syndrome disappeared and I’m feeling the best I’ve felt in a long time.  The first week I was tired but after that passed it’s been nothing but a sense of inner peace and calmness.  So happy I tried this medicine again.  I think the dose of 100 mg is a perfect dose for me.,Winterviolet

14,Seroquel,Schizophrenia,10.0,,"August 29, 2019",198,"This drug has really helped me with the voices and the paranoia.I have been on it for nearly 3 years.I have been on pretty much every antipsychotic there is and have been dealing with this illness for a long, long time.The downside is that you will gain weight. I have lost some of it by reducing calories and taking metformin. Walking seems to help too.If you do take this one, stay as active as you can to avoid diabetes because as my psychiatrist told me ""It will happen eventually""Also, I adopted a vegatarian diet to help lower other risks with this one.The other downside is that it can make you very tired. I take 400mg at night and 75mg in the morning and another 75mg in the afternoon.I still hear voices and don't want to be around other people but it is much more manageable and I can at least have some kind of life.To be honest, I probably would have killed myself if it were not for this drug.I am surprised I even wrote this as I am a very paranoid person.",Mrmeds

Really helped get rid of the voices although I did still hear some. Unfortunately I had to be taken off of Seroquel due to the damage it was causing to my liver. If it wasn't for the negative side effects it would have been the perfect medication for me.",Coryman616

18,Seroquel,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 13, 2018",70,I've been taking Seroquel for a long time. It destroyed my life. It's addictive because when you stop taking it you'll never be able to sleep again. There's no getting off of it. I sleep in till 2 to 5 pm every day. I'm sluggish all day. It never helped with any of my symptoms of schizophrenia. It makes me crave sugar immensely. This drug is very dangerous. You have to be very careful when taking it. Don't drive or be around people you don't know or trust. Let's just say I could sleep through anything. This drug should be illegal even if it does help some people with their mental illness. There are other things people can take. Risperdal for example does wonders for me. I'm working with my doctor on getting off of Seroquel. I didn't do it sooner because I'm so sick I can barely accomplish anything really. I just want to say to all schizophrenics I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that NOBODY has any idea of what's happening to you.,Suraya Jada
19,Seroquel,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 2, 2018",29,"My daughter began taking 400mg of Seroquel when she was 17 years old. The first year she gained over 40 pounds.  Her doctor recognized that the weight gain was contributing to her depression. He prescribed Topamax. My understanding is that  Topamax is normally used to treat seizures but this medication also helps with impulsivity (which she struggles with as well).   A side effect is that it’s an appetite suppressant, or at least that’s how it effects my daughter.  She currently takes  100 mg a day and is back down to her regular weight.  I hope others can safely be prescribe this medication  if their doctors find it appropriate.",Boo’s Mom

Hell it may have had made me sleepy 24/7, I would sleep sometimes 18 hours a day I spent a lot of time recovering with this medication.. sleeping. But I can't complain because well.. I have my life back. And I thank all those people who put their time and effort in producing this medication because without them, who knows where I'd be.. right now I'm back in college off of this medication but still on abilify.

22,Seroquel,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 18, 2017",29,"Out of all the anti-psychotics I have taken, Seroquel makes me feel the most normal! I was on put on Geodon originally in 2012 when I had my first psychotic break.  The Geodon made me gain 60 lb eventually caused insomnia, binge eating, and heavy drinking. Drugs like Fanapt and Lutuda made me more depressed/mind rush. I was put on Seroquel in 2015. My binge eating disorder continued, and I gained 40 lbs that year :/. It made me feel a million times better than Geodon though. I was able to stop popping Xanax and klonopin everyday. I eventually stopped binge eating in October, 2016 and lost the 40lbs. Currently I take 600mg of seroquel and 100mg of Zoloft, and .5 mg of Xanax at night as needed to quiet my thoughts.",Paranoid Schizophrenic

My delusions never went away, but I can control my thoughts better. I think of something delusional, but I don't follow the train of thought. Since I started a serious relationship 2 years ago, I have been working on my anger and paranoia that he would hurt me. It's harder to control my emotions. Right now, I have a outrageous story in my head about him, but after reading the posts on this website, I know these feelings aren't new. I've felt them with my own family. I'm going to a National Alliance of Mental health Illness (NAMI) meeting soon to get support about how lonely it can feel to be exhausted.

Well this stuff put my entire body into extreme shock. I did not drink alcohol, I don't do drugs, don't smoke, and took proper dosage as prescribed. I was rushed to the hospital on this stuff, first dose. It was like my entire body on the inside was constantly being shocked with electricity and outside I literally could not move or even sit up. My body was shaking and felt freezing and had the feeling of being bruised. Took about 6 to 8 hours to wear off. Did not take again.",Samantha554444

Not my kind of medication.My mother inlaw takes 250 mg a day for schizophrenia, she has for six months now,  so far it is not helping her delusions, hallucinations, paranoia.

I will never again take medicine that is not prescribed for me! For the first time ever... I heard voices starting at 2 am. I heard two men arguing on the other side of my closed bedroom door, loud enough to wake me but I couldn't make out what they were saying. I was too afraid to look because I knew no one was there. Then around 4:30 am I heard a baby crying non stop this lasted until 7:00 am. I sat up for hours listening to what if feels like to be going insane! Never again!",Lizziepoo

I am diagnosed as schizophrenic but for the last 10 years I have had very little symptoms. After 6 years of being shifted from one med to another all of which made me feel awful, made me put on weight and had no effect on my condition.I was happy to be put on seroquel purely because I felt normal but still had very little effect on my symptoms. I was very reluctant to change meds again so stuck with it . I had my energy back and was getting out exercising and started to loose the weight I'd put on . The schizophrenia was still there but at least I was getting a break from just sitting there with it.  It took a while but after 2-3 years the symptoms started to decrease and just kept on decreasing .",Bazzzaaa1

I was finding on lower doses my paranoia was overwhelming and my depression was getting to the suicidal point. Now I'm on a higher dose I'm like a zombie, lack of motivation in everything I do.

32,Seroquel,Schizophrenia,10.0,,"June 22, 2015",31,"I've been on seroquel twice now. I was hearing voices all day that affected my PTSD, then it was a falling block thing with my anxiety and depression. I love this medication because I also have sleeping problems - falling asleep and staying asleep. There's XR and non XR (time release). I'm on 450; the higher you are on, the longer it takes to fall asleep. The only bad thing about this medication is weight gain. Be careful with that. I did research on all schizophrenic medications and they all cause weight gain. Just a note; the reason I pay $60 is because I need to take 300 + 150 to make 450. The XR is $15 more.

34,Seroquel,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 1, 2014",47,"Seroquel- Out of Risperdal, Zyprexa, Trilafon, Abilify, Haldol, and Geodon, Seroquel is by far the best one. At lower doses, it is good for anxiety. You don't feel like a zombie on it. Obviously it helps you sleep, but at lower doses you won't be sleepy or if you just take it at bed time. Abilify and Haldol turned me into a complete zombie it was terrible. Risperdal had sexual side effects and of course the breast growth issue, but I would say Risperdal is the second best one behind Seroquel. Haldol and Abilify help paranoia big time but they also exasperate anxiety, definitely stay away from those. Geodon and Zyprexa are worse than those medicines. Geodon made me disoriented, helpless, still very paranoid. Zyprexa is probably the second worst.",Corksters

After taking the half the first night at eight and feeling drunk I decided this might not be for me so I cut the half in half and take a quarter pill a night.  It has helped me sleep and seems to curve my over thinking things and thinking that every comment or conversation on social media is about me.  I think also by getting off social media altogether it also helped my situation.  But overall good medication, it's the only thing I take.",country mom
36,Seroquel,Schizophrenia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 21, 2012",42,"Seroquel worked in getting rid of my psychotic symptoms (voices, etc). It was a hard medication to go on, I would need to sleep 12 hours during the first week and I would wake up in that 12 hours in an almost intoxicated state. There was nothing that would wake me up in the morning but I think during medication changes it is important to listen to your body so I rested and in a week, that went away. I came off Risperidone in that first week as well so that may have contributed. The medication did make me sweat a LOT and it would take me a long time to cool down on it. My dyskensic side effects from risperidone went away. But I had to come off Seroquel in a month because I had an allergic 3 weeks in...watch out for tight throat/trouble swallowing.",Anonymous

The good thing about Seroquel is that I have only sleeping as a side effect. I have been on other meds and had everything, dry mouth, blurred vision, drooling, constipation, you name it, I had it. So Seroquel is at least good for that.

It is sedating though and takes a little time for your body to adjust to it.
