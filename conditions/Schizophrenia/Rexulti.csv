0,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 25, 2021",1,"I am. a patient from Denmark. From the very first dose I had an anxiety attack just 30 min after taking it and had to call an ambulance and put on a 24 hour observation hold because my heartrate would climb to 180 with me just trying to stand up. My doctor proclaimed that rexulti couldn't be the cause so I continued taking it and I been on it for almost 6 month it been a living nightmare.  i can't sleep. I eat all the time gained 20kg total over my medication history, I feel low on energy and paranoid and reached a point to where I think I'm better of without  medicine I don't recall being so miserable before medication",André
1,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 1, 2021",3,I have Schizotypal personality disorder and for the first time in my life I can see what's around me without feeling I'm looking at a picture. I don't melt down over scary things or feel the constant state of danger anymore. My mind is calm and I can focus on the present instead of being overwhelmed by traumas from long ago. I do have mild hunger all the time but I can live with that. I'm following a diabetic diet plan to prevent weight gain just in case.  This medicine is a real blessing,MJR
2,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 26, 2021",1,"Well, Rexulti would do its job but side effects made me restless and twitchy. It also is too stimulating and made me insomniac even if taken in the morning. In fear of tardive dyskinesia because of twitching I had to switch off.",drugreviewer6
3,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,3.0,,"May 20, 2021",3,"I have schizoaffective disorder. For a long time I thought Rexulti was a miracle. Over time though I started having metabolic problems and my psychiatric symptoms returned, albeit altered. I had to quit due to medical reasons, and when I did I did not have a major psychotic episode, my condition improved.Given that the medical industry has shown repeatedly that they do not have patients best interests at heart, (they are capitalist enterprises focused solely on profit, any benefit to the patient is ancillary and useful only for marketing purposes.) I see it as a hallmark of a good patient-doctor relationship that a good faith effort is made by both parties toward a clear understanding of risks, mechanisms of action, and other relevant information.",GILDTHEKAYA
4,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 3, 2021",2,For me this medication did not work . This medication made me extremely reckless and impulsive. It changed my paranoid thoughts into rage towards whatever I was thinking. I'm glad that I know I'm paranoid because I feel if I believed what I'm experiencing I would not be free writing this. I'm glad this helps some people but not for me.,Truck
5,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 22, 2021",2,"I was on 1mg of Rexulti for 6months for Delusional disorder . Never had any side effects except sleeping for 12 hours a day and gaining 20 kg. I was grateful for this medication as it got rid of my delusions. Overall, I felt much better than before.",Jane
6,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 4, 2021",3,I really don't like it. It makes me sleepy and un-energetic during the day. I worry about not waking up when I'm needed for an emergency. The drug is too strong for me to wake up when needed,honest
7,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 7, 2020",21,"This medication worked well for reducing my general anxiety and making me feel much better and have a clearer mind and less moody, I take it for Bipolar w/ differential diagnosis PTSD. My only complaint is I have minor auditory hallucinations. They don't bother me enough to change medication as I've tried Seroquel, Geodon, Wellbutrin, Abilify, lithium, Prozac, Lexapro, Latuda, and have been on Lamictal for years. The Latuda worked best but insurance won't cover it. The auditory hallucinations are things like my cat meowing, my phone alarm going off, and my name being said. It's a good medication, I still have anxiety that is so bad I have considered ordering groceries and other things exclusively online because I still get extremely anxious around people.",Lee
8,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 29, 2020",9,This medication didn't work for me. I was totally out of my head with  Schizophrenia with in 2 weeks of changing to the Rexulti.  I'll never go back on this one.,No name
9,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 17, 2020",45,"I have had to opposite experience than others on this site. I was on Abilify for about 10 years after trying every 2nd gen anti psychotic. I also have Trauma PTSD. Anyway at some point abilify stopped working well and I became extremely manic and aggressive. I completely stopped sleeping. Honestly just stayed up all night sitting in a chair being weird and catatonic with racing thoughts. When I rarely fell asleep it would only be for a couple hrs. Dr. switched me to Rexulti because of studies showing it helps with PTSD and within 3 days I felt so so much better. I was less paranoid, less agitated, no voices, no paralysis, no EPS. Way better than Abilify ever was. I also started to sleep 6-8 hrs straight every night. It is like it just reset something in my brain and I began to sleep again. I guess it either really works for you or really doesn't.",SAJ
10,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 18, 2020",9,Please do NOT take this medication  Rexulti it will make you feel horrid and inhuman and it doesn't stop. I was given it for Schizoaffective disorder.  Be ready to be in pain.  It has been a solid week now of no rexulti and I still feel like I'm on it and can't escape this nightmare.,Nsjsn
11,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 4, 2019",30,This drug has almost completely halted all hallucinations (I have Schizoaffective disorder). To my knowledge I am not delusional and I seem to be able to follow conversations better. I have tried 5 other antipsychotics and none were even half as effective. Also I HAVE NO SIDE EFFECTS!!!! 6 months in and I will never go off. 4mg daily,Kaya
12,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 28, 2019",20,"I've been taking Rexulti for a 3-4 weeks. I'm a bit cranky all the time, always moody. But the PTSD has gone, and I'm thinking clearer. I still have anxious thoughts but they have always been there. My paranoia is controlled by CBT and reiterating soothing thoughts. I feel more motivated to study and procrastinate less. I have more hours in a day because I can wake up at 5am.",Pes
13,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 4, 2019",39,My daughter was taking abilify for 6 yrs and they switched her to this drug Rexulti because they said it had less weight gain issues.  At first it work great for about 8 weeks then just stopped working. She developed hiccups on and off with this med and her body temperature was going hit and cold she then became very confused and could not focus then extremely depressed and I took her to the emergency room where 16 hrs later she had a grand mal seizure. Don’t take this Med I don’t think they’ve done enough research on it and it is still to new. My daughter was in the hospital 2 1/2 weeks and still is unable to think properly or focus on anything and still experiencing hiccups on and off now. I hope and pray she recovers. She was in college getting straight A’s before this.,Shell
14,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 8, 2019",17,I was on zyprexa for 9 years no issues them. I had Tardive dyskinesia . I was put on rexulti it worked for about a month got me out of the withdrawals of zyprexa but the rexulti gave me hot flashes every night so bad I had panic attacks on top of it I had extremely angry outburst for no reason I also had self harm behaviors during the outbursts.

17,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 11, 2018",38,"Since starting Rexulti a week & a half ago I've been feeling more motivated, I have more energy & I feel less irritable. I'm studying more productively. I haven't been experiencing intrusive thoughts - obviously I can remember what they were, therefore they still enter my mind, but they're not distressing & they don't linger. So, ultimately I feel 'normal' again i.e. without illness or side effects. (I'm still overweight & I still procrastinate, but since beginning this new treatment I have the motivation & energy to transform to the person I want to be).",Jylo
18,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,3.0,,"November 27, 2018",10,"Chest pains, headaches galore. Not to mention my memory has been horrible and my legs have been very restless. Thursday (11/22/18) I was relaxing, calm. But then there was a ringing in my ears as there had been everyday 3 days prior. I began to feel like I was dying, which was me beginning to panic due to the effects I've been having. I haven't had health anxiety since I was 8 years old. I'm 18 now, but never this bad. I began to get agitated very quickly and I couldn't stop moving. I was pacing around my house, moving my legs, rocking back and forth and threatening my parents as I grew more agitated and feeling like I was in a cage. I could not get in touch with my prescriber so I had to go to the ER. Eventually, I got tired and it subsided so I did not need the sedative the hospital staff wanted to give me. Blood work, EKG and urine test all fine. I've been on it for roughly 6-8 weeks and it stopped working.",Sarah

20,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,10.0,,"September 12, 2018",19,"Rexulti/Brexpiprazole has been amazing for my lifestyle while dealing with Schizophrenia.When I was on Risperidone, I was having trouble getting up for work, and was getting to work late at 10-10.30am.I also had two episodes of acute Schizophrenia on a low dose Risperidone over 4 years.The side effects on a higher dose of risperidone made me feel lethargic and tired all day.However, on an equivalent dose of Rexulti, the voices are not there anymore. Intrusive thoughts are more controlled.And I get up early enough in the morning to get to work by 8.30-9! Has happened for two weeks now, and I'm pretty sure this will continue, because I don't feel the same lethargy as I did on risperidone.So in effect, I'm on a relatively high dose, but the side effects are much lower than risperidone. I am really happy with the results.",Dipodo
21,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 25, 2018",35,"Rexulti is the first anti-psychotic I've been on with no apparent side effects. It has my schizophrenia under control and has completely gotten rid of my voices. It also helps control my paranoia, psychosis, and helps with my gut-wrenching anxiety so I can get out of my apartment and lead a normal life. I have nothing but good things to say about Rexulti.",Coryman616
22,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 24, 2018",9,"This medicine is horrible. My hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia are increased 10 times worse than before. I have agitation, body temperature dysregulation issues, dizziness, insomnia (despite taking Temazepam), and it makes it difficult to think. I don't recommend this medication.",Schizogirl
23,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 17, 2018",19,"Rexulti has stopped my delusions and obsessive ruminationing where Seroquel XR amongst others failed,  and in the short period of time I have been on this drug, it has also mostly taken away my extreme paranoid anxiety, which was unrelenting. My brain is quiet and calm. A slight opiate like warmth and peace of mind. It is lifting a depressive episode, in a much smoother, mild way compared to my experience on Effexor XR. No akathisia. I am not sure if my sleep is affected because I have always had sleep issues regardless. I am prescribed a little Temazepam to sleep if needed. A slight headache for a few days upon starting, no nausea. No weight gain. Very pleased with how this is working so far.",cobweb
24,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 8, 2018",13,I tapered off Haldol and took this medicine. By itself it does no good and sent me to the mental hospital. They gave me Haldol along with Rexulti and since then it has been very good. I don't even hardly think about a hallucination or delusion anymore much less experience them.,james youngfellow
25,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 27, 2018",22,Rexulti seems too be a good medicine so far. After one week my paranoia is almost gone. I do notice a speedy effect which has caused me too be more active. This is actually good because rexulti is helping me too get out of the house and avoid some social phobia issues.  I would definitely recommend this med if you have any kind of paranoia associated with bipolar depression. Tommorow the 7th day I will increase too one mg. Lets hope this med continues too work .Thanks and good luck. Ps I have been on many meds and hated most all atypical antipsychotics.,davos777
26,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 7, 2017",17,"I am on a dose of 4 mg. I feel very pleased about this medication. It is very quiet, no voices. I have been on the medication for 2 months. I was gradually introduced to a higher and higher dose. At 4 mg., I  am finally not afraid from the thoughts I have that are delusions. I do have an increase in appetite, and a bit of restlessness. But the benefits of this medicine far outweigh any adverse effects.  I am not anxious as bad as I was either. And I can get up and take care of housework better. I am liking this med very much.",Jameelah1
27,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,,,"June 26, 2017",32,"Rexulti has helped my bipolar mania in so many way. From previous experience with antipsychotics, I was expecting side effects like increased appetite, excessive sleepiness, etc. I did get akathisia when I first began, but I did begin at 3mg (a high dose). I reduced back down to 0.5 and gradually increased to 1mg. So far (1.5 months), I have seen extreme improvement in my mood and sleep schedule. I feel more motivated and am getting more of my responsibilities done. My social anxiety is pretty much gone as is my GAD. The only issues I have is periodically having trouble falling asleep, but this is not significant. Overall, I think Rexulti has really helped me in many ways and I attribute the positive results in my recent life to Rexulti",Mmaryland
28,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,,,"June 17, 2017",19,"for the first week I took this, I had some nausea and very intense sleepiness that made me take one and even 2 naps during the day. But I changed the time of day I took it and that seemed to help. For the first month I was sooo happy, and a lot less delusional. I'm not quite sure where it all went wrong. Now, my delusions have worsened, I've developed an intense phobia of driving and being in a car in general. I have many intrusive thoughts and honestly I'm considering stopping it. Which sucks because it worked there for awhile. I wouldn't say don't take this medicine, but pay attention to your body and be wary of any anxiety you're experiencing and talk to your doctor to get a handle on it before it gets out of hand.",Suzanne L
29,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 2, 2017",32,"I am not sure how many months I have been on this medication, but while I have been on it I have managed to gain almost 10 pounds. I do not feel like I over-eat either. The weight just seems to pile on.  I feel incredibly sleepy during the day.  So much so that on most days I take a long nap.  I have very little energy. My stomach seems to bloat out more. Otherwise I seem to be doing just fine, both mentally and physically.  So if you don't mind being fat, lazy, and lifeless; but not crazy; this might just be the drug for you!",Dissapointed

32,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 10, 2016",34,"This was a game changing medication for me. I was diagnosed schizoaffective, later changed to bipolar 1. I was a zombie from the medication combination I used to be on, zyprexa and depakote. Changing the zyprexa to rexulti gave me my life back. At first, it gave me side effects of dizziness and anxiety, but after stopping and trying again, its given me energy, concentration, and the mood swings and psychosis stopped. I'm very happy with this medication. I just upped the dosage from 2mg to 3mg after being on it for a year and a half.",Kutiekatie22

37,Rexulti,Schizophrenia,8.0,,"December 17, 2015",25,I was taking risperdal before this but that made me too lethargic and have loss of interest in everything. Rexulti has helped me with my bipolar and mild schizophrenia. I take 2mg/day. I only had minor side effects like headaches and upset stomach the first week which faded away. I also take Celexa 40mg a day which I have been on for a year. The first few months it worked great but these past few months it doesn't seem to be working. I'm considering cutting down to 20mg/day of celexa because I think the combination of these drugs is too strong for me.,PeaceLoveHappiness
