0,Risperdal,Schizophrenia,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 24, 2021",2,"Took this for psychotic depression. It made me unnaturally tired, like I was fighting the effects of a sleep medication all the time! I also started overeating and was constantly hungry (like with Zyprexa). I did feel less anxious, but it wasn't worth it. Wouldn't recommend based on my experience. One note if you're autistic like me - some people report being more sensitive to side effects. It was complete news to me, but makes sense with my history.",tyhmyydenylistys
1,Risperdal,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 11, 2021",10,I have to say that some of us have nothing better to do with our time than just writing anonymous reviews with our creative nom de plumes. I have read many of such reviews on many websites and I have come to the conclusion that many of them are reflections of the user's mind. Some say they have an increased appetite while others say the exact opposite! Strange. This is why I would like to say that Risperidone has made me gain weight because I now have a ravenous appetite; it made me tired the whole day until I was put on Fluoxetine by my shrink who took so long to tell me that Fluoxetine removes the tiredness (partly). Early mornings are the worst - it is as though I am flooded with demonic thoughts of not having to bathe. Brilliant way to start the day. Joanna Moncrieff is right about some things but she gets it wrong when she calls this drug as having a 'placebo' effect. Not really. It has removed all my delusions and hallucinations.,anonymous

But ever since being put on 2mg, all the delusions have stopped and I can function like a normal human being. I've had no side effects whatsoever. I was scared of starting risperidone because of all the negative reviews but it is honestly the best antipsychotic I have tried (and I've tried three).

I've been having really bad swallowing issues on this med and we're hoping the lower dose helps with this. Otherwise a great medicine for me I've been active in the community and able to control some of my unusual thoughts. I would recommend this medication, but be cautious of the side effects. I've been on the med for 2 years now. I gained 40lbs and remarkably I was able to lose 50lbs since starting Risperdal.",puppylove

Currently staying at 1 mg in order to have semi normal cognitive function. When I went up to 4 mg. I was catatonic for 6 months until the dose got lowered down to 1 mg.

I am not as easily agitated and sleep better at night. Prior to Respirdal I had severe insomnia and was easily moved to anger.

9,Risperdal,Schizophrenia,3.0,,"April 12, 2019",35,I was forced to end taking haldol 2.5 mg/night after 27 1/2 years -over 10000 days- because they stopped making it. I was prescribed risperdal. I started at 2mg a day and they reduced the dosage to 1 mg. I also stopped cogentin and Prozac because of strong discomfort. After around 40-50 days of risperdal I didn't sleep as well and felt utterly horrible like a zombie- like it was torturing and destroying my brain. I came to my senses and rid myself of all medication whatsoever since it seemed to be harming my brain and not helping me sleep and have recovered from all mental illness in about 5 days and am getting somewhat less sleep but feel a lot better overall. So the medicine was good in that it convinced me to get rid of it and all medication and completely recover. I believe people who take risperdal should be reviewed after 30-50 days or so and given the option to stop taking it and maybe all medication if they have horrible zombie like side effects like I did.,Hef
10,Risperdal,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 5, 2019",23,"This has helped a lot for my daughter's hallucinations. She was not diagnosed with schizophrenia, so her hallucinations are related to either her epilepsy or something else. There have been a couple of times where she stopped taking it because she felt better, but then the hallucinations would come back. She had to go on the highest dose after she stopped taking it the first time, so if you find this works for you or a loved one, just make sure they don't stop abruptly.",Anonymous
11,Risperdal,Schizophrenia,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 19, 2019",34,"Just my experience, your mileage may vary. Odd tunnel vision as it takes effect. After about 2 weeks, expect your wife to be very unsatisfied. If your job involves mental math or coding, this will become much more challenging. It dulls your emotions even beyond what your horrible affliction will. I became an impotent robot with no processing power. The cure, at least for me, was worse than the disease. I have since learned to ignore, or at least recognize and not take them as absolute reality. Mental gymnastics and proper training are equally effective; the side effects of Respirdal are life altering in a bad way.",Meh

So far, this is a decent drug. I feel like the way I was before my psychotic episodes began, and it's very nice. The downside is high prolactin levels and slight weight gain (roughly 10lbs). My doctor and I are in the process of getting off of it (currently at 2mg) but this drug did the trick to placate delusions. I would recommend but not for long term.",Hell yah

15,Risperdal,Schizophrenia,1.0,,"July 24, 2018",21,"I was prescribed Risperdal after voluntarily admitting myself into a psychiatric hospital in Connecticut back in '17. Risperdal was the first antipsychotic drug that I was administered during my stay, and while I did experience some relief from my anxiety, I would say that the side-effects were more negative than positive. Upon entering the hospital, I was aware of my surroundings and completely aware of reality. At time I was also unsure of my own diagnosis so it wasn't easy taking the Risperdal. I was officially diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder and paranoid ideation. Upon release I found the side effects to be negative. I was sleeping the majority of the day at my house, and had a difficult time finding motivation to leave the house. Drug is incredibly powerful and while I think it can be used for very severe illnesses, I wouldn't recommend it until someone is thoroughly evaluated and the proper diagnosis is made.",K-Man

I became drowsy, lost all motivation and couldn't care about anything. I was able to come off it after a great struggle and remained drug free for eleven years and was able to enjoy all the things I couldn't because of this drug.

It was  because I was hearing voices and was paranoid and smoking marijuana almost every day for a period of 6 months.  I got  as side effects stiffness, spasms, trembling, increase in saliva, decrease in sexual ability.  I have been taking now 1 pill every other day until I don't take it anymore since the doctor said that I had to take it at least for a year without smoking to find out if the problem goes away.  I'm looking for another pill to control the these symptoms and I am not smoking or hearing voices anymore. Read all the comments but I do not constipate or gain weight.

19,Risperdal,Schizophrenia,1.0,,"May 15, 2018",14,I was forced into a Canadian mental hospital in the late 90s when I was 13 years old (I'm male by the way). They woke me up in bed and gave me a cup with pills and told me it was to help me with sleep. It was later on that they told me that the pills were risperdal. When I was on Respirdal I gained a lot of weight and was drowsy. I even developed minor gynecomastia that still remained 3 years later. I'm in my 30s now and the gynecomastia surgery isn't covered by any insurance companies. What was covered was the ultrasound and mammogram. I don't have the money to pay for the glandular breast tissue removal surgery. People notice my male breast growth and tell me that I have breasts. My doctor says my gynecomastia is noticeable when I take my shirt off. People who know me notice breast growth through my t shirt. Can the Canadian Government cover the cost of breast removal surgery if I am required to take antipsychotics that side effects are that grow breasts.,Eli White
20,Risperdal,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 6, 2018",10,I find it helps in terms of what I wanted with the voices and all but the side effects make me very drowsy and tired and I can barely muster the energy to do anything in my day. My moods been pretty low or up and down too. I find myself to still have a slight paranoia of others. Even when I first starting the meds the first few times I believed I was being poisoned but I usually felt like everyone offering me drinks or food were trying to harm me so not really anything new there. That part has calmed down a fair bit. I hope one day they can find a way to completely rid me of this so I don't have to rely on medications all the time cause I sometimes forget to take them or  I can't find them on occasion. I'm glad I'm back on them though after I was initially told by the mental hospital that I'm not to have them anymore which mucked me up. I hope I'm not forced to stop again cause this is honestly my peace.,Ashley Dwyer

I suffer from PTSD and schizophrenia primarily with thought disorder (although I have hallucinated and heard voices). I used to scream in my sleep and thought everyone was trying to kill me. When I started risperdal the terrifying thoughts stopped and my behavior returned to normal. I take risperdal with a combination of gabapentin and zoloft. I now have a very good job and good relationships with my friends, family, and co-workers.  There are downsides to this drug such as weight gain.

Taking this meds made me feel worse with most of my symptoms. I had moments where I felt over tranquillized and trouble communicating how I really felt. I know I felt better before the medication. Now that I am off of it my list of negative side effects is quite large. I wouldn't reccomend this medication to anyone. Especially if you have an endless diagnosis in the first place. Be careful believing what your Drs say. They get all of their recommendations from pharmaceutical companies. Once I was off of this medication Drs. Refuse to listen to me. They just recommend I take it again or take other drugs. They refuse to admit their mistakes. They refuse to acknowledge anything.,HopelessAgain

Originally, I was taking it for ruminating thoughts (I call it busy head) and difficulty sleeping. It definitely helped slow down my thoughts and allowed me to sleep better.

When I stopped the medication, the weight fell off.  Most recently, I'm using it as an adjunct therapy to Neurontin and Trileptal for agitation and anxiety.
