0,Latuda,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 12, 2022",0,"Taken for three months. Only slightly stopped paranoid thoughts. Within weeks caused severe akathisia restlessness or need to move"" which really means having to move 24/7 while knees and feet hurt, terror anxiety, inability for any stimulation, tremors, insane insomnia like an hour -3 a night, nausea and diarrhea. These symptoms didn’t stop until months after stopping med. Insomnia and outside and inside tremors after meds took over a year. When I go to an online support group for those with akathisia who took Latuda they all have the same issues. I’ve heard multiple times from doctors that this drug doesn’t work for schizophrenia. I often wonder where these positive reviews come from.",Jill
1,Latuda,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 6, 2021",1,"I was prescribed this earlier this year, in July and I was only on it for a day. It helped my benzodiazepine withdrawal SOME but it immediately gave me insane akathisia where I felt extremely anxious in my legs and couldn’t sit still, everything was making me panic and cry and I felt sleepy as anything, almost nodded off several times while in public and even on my date with my boyfriend and I threw up a few times. That was my first and last time taking it. Never again, wouldn’t recommend 0/10",Ivy

I took this from October 2016-April 2017 when I was 18 years old, 60mg twice a day for schizophrenia, anxiety and panic attacks. Although it made the paranoia and anxiety go away, it gave me INSANE akathisia where I would move around in my seat as if I had to pee really really bad, paced back and forth even though I couldn’t keep my eyes open, my arms felt restless and I had this unexplainable cold feeling inside my body. I stopped in March 2017 but to this day I still have tardive dyskinesia and I’m on a different medication now. This one sucked, smh",Mata juice

Side effects include leaking breasts, weight gain of approx 25kg, though it happened gradually, and inability to orgasm on 160mg. My psychiatrist has put the dose down to 120mg to see if that deals with the sexual side effects but that was only yesterday so I don’t know yet if it worked. I also get hot overnight (I take it in the evening) and sometimes get a tremor in my hands during the night.

18,Latuda,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 4, 2020",10,"I have Depression(lifelong dysthymia) and anxiety and trouble falling/staying asleep. I've started Latuda to replace amitryptyline, in addition Cymbalta and Buspar. I was taking amitryptyline for over a year but it was no longer helping me fall asleep or stay asleep very long, nor helping depression. At 20 mg of Latuda I noticed no benefits for falling/staying asleep and kept taking 25mg of Amitryptyline with my other meds. It caused me to dream a lot of vivid dreams, which I enjoy because it is a much needed break from reality. But unfortunately there were no mood benefits. So the Latuda was doubled to 40mg and amitryptyline was discontinued again. I've been sleeping much better and am still having crazy/fun/amusing vivid dreams. I think my mood has definitely improved too, but it is hard to tell. But now I am super tired when I get up and have fallen asleep again a few times today.

I also had restlessness, an uncontrollable urge to get up and walk around, self-isolation and fear of others, high blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, extreme sweating, trouble sleeping, blurred vision, weight gain, and racing thoughts. It was torture.I will take the chance of relapsing in order to determine if I will remain normal without meds. In these three years I never had any symptoms and I don't think it would be intelligent to immediately assume it was because the meds had been working the whole time.

I was informed that the drug could cause side effects, such as extreme unrest when getting to sleep. After two months of use I started to feel horrible side effects. Feeling extremely vulnerable in social situations and anxiety. Often I experienced the worst nightmares through the nights while being/feeling fully awake. I had uncontrolled panic attacks and started to sweat heavily. Many unpleasant thoughts and even experiencing not being alone. Also physical abnormal behaviour in the face/mouth/tongue. This could last for many hours until I fell to sleep being totally exhausted. I never had such issues before. It happened mostly once a week. I always was afraid to go to sleep.

So bad I had to stop. Hopefully I can find a way with my doctor to manage the anxiety because everyone around me noticed I was a LOT easier to deal with. 40mg a day.If you have psychotic thoughts,  try it.

I can work part time, and am well during the day. My voices are now minimal. I can drive better. The only problem is the anxiety I get about 2 hours after having the tablet.

The main catch was akathisia. An intense internal feeling of distress and inner tension mixed with objective motor restlessness. I bounced my legs constantly and felt tense. I was fine during the daytime but after I took it it was awful every night. My eyes would roll backwards from the emotional agony. I would  feel frustrated and tense mostly every night.

It took probably about 2-3 months for the hallucinations to finally go away, you could tell the volume on them were going down every day.  I had moderate akathisia. This was on 40 mg of Latuda.  After months of having no voices, I decided to try tapering off it to 30mg and noise hearing has started to creep in again (sob!), but my akathisia much went away and a felt a bit more alert.  I'm debating staying on this at 30mg, I seem to also have a lot of demotivation and anhedonia since I started taking the drugs but they could just also be negative symptoms of psychosis.

106,Latuda,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 22, 2013",45,"In my opinion only, this medication has marginal efficiency in treating the positive and some negative symptoms of my psychosis. This medication help me think better and organize my thoughts more clearly, along with significantly reducing most of my delusions. However, from my personal experience I do not feel that this medication is very effective in treating depression, or depression related issues such as crying and getting angry easily. Otherwise, this medication also has some positive effects in treating bipolar symptoms.",Rstrong
107,Latuda,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 12, 2013",81,"Excellent medicine in my experience.I've been taking it about 6 months. I'm now working and going to school full time. Anxiety has improved significantly, almost to pre-illness levels. I feel great cognitively (creative, zero psychotic symptoms, memory seems pretty sharp).Although I've never really gained weight on Risperidone for 2 years was relatively weight neutral. I've actually lost 5-10 lbs. since taking Latuda, pretty much without trying.The one minor annoyance would have to be that it requires 350 calories for full absorption and it puts me to sleep about an hour after taking it. I end up eating a small meal/snack before bed every night (yogurt, nuts, etc.).",40windmills
108,Latuda,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 16, 2012",43,"I've tried many antipsychotics in the past like Risperdal, Geodon, Abilify, Saphris and Seroquel. My favorite has to be Seroquel. Latuda compared to all atypical antipyschotics is better tolerated than most second generation atypicals and it doesn't have the drawback of extreme akethisia like Geodon. Also glucose and lipids levels changes where compared to that of placebo so I'm happy to say this purchase was worth it.",marcos e vazquez 420
109,Latuda,Schizophrenia,6.0,,"August 28, 2011",48,My daughter takes 40mg of the Latuda. You should always take it with your dinner no later then five or you will be tried in the morning. This was told to me by her doctor. She has been on this medicine for about 7 months. She sleeps well at night.,Anonymous
110,Latuda,Schizophrenia,10.0,,"August 4, 2011",67,This is the end of the second month on Latuda and I like it because there aren't any side effects.  I sleep less than I did on the many other medicines I have tried.  I'm finally losing weight (with the other medicines I'd gained 40 lbs).  Overall I have more energy with this medicine and it seems to be very effective.  I take a 40mg dosage.,Anonymous
111,Latuda,Schizophrenia,4.0,,"July 27, 2011",64,"This medication did not work well for me. I keep hearing voices while I go to sleep. It seems like the medication only works for 3 or 4 hours. Then, it stops working. I am also having a problem with center of balance with this medication. I keep having mini-vertigos. I saw the other ratings and I was tempted but this medication just did not workout for me.",Anonymous
112,Latuda,Schizophrenia,10.0,,"May 13, 2011",117,"2 weeks ago I had a severe psychotic break despite both Abilify and Geodon. To avoid hospitalization, my doctor and I usually add Zyprexa, but I wanted to avoid the rapid weight gain, though it is otherwise a miracle drug. This time we tried Latuda. Within about 5 days my thoughts were much clearer, my energy higher, mood brighter. Overall Latuda seemed the medication I had been looking for: Zyprexa without side effects: no weight gain and no extreme sedation (in fact the opposite): I sleep fine at night. I do at times take a little Ativan, at night but not always. And I wake in the morning eager to rise and meet whatever the day brings. In short, I haven't felt better and more hopeful than this is a very long while.",RobinWren
113,Latuda,Schizophrenia,10.0,,"March 18, 2011",85,"I have been taking this medication for almost a month. I had a good experience at 40mg and opted to try the higher dosage of 80mg. It has been nothing short of amazing. I have been on every AAP except for Clozapine with mediocre to average results.. even in combinations. I do take the 80mg of Latuda with 300mg of Seroquel XR, but the Latuda has made a huge difference cognitively.",Deep Sea Philosopher
114,Latuda,Schizophrenia,,,"March 1, 2011",80,I have been taking Latuda a little over a week. So far my experience with this medicine has been a positive one. I started out on 40mg but a few days later I was switched to 80mg. So far the only side effects I've had are an extremely dry mouth and loss of appetite. I am also taking Lithium and Artane. Will post more after I've been on Latuda a little while longer.,flirtingwith40
