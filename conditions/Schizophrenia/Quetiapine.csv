I don’t have a diagnosis, I just know I was feeling bad from the moment I opened my eyes in the morning to the bedtime. I mean, I had the feeling I was in danger, stuck on the hyper vigilance mode all day long, and I was so tired. Since one week I’m on seroquel 300mg, I just feel lighter.

I took the smallest dosage both times for schizophrenia and depression and I felt like sooo bad on this!! I was insanely sleepy, dozing off in class, at lunch, in public, I gained SOOOO much weight and my stomach was literally a bottomless pit!

4,Quetiapine,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 24, 2021",1,"I take 200mg and have been doing so for around a year.  It has worked great on the actual issues and allows me to actually sleep. However, technically, no, it is not addictive, but you become dependent on it to sleep. Forget your meds when you go somewhere and I get maybe 1, 2 hours of sleep. I had issues when moving and was off of it for a month, was pretty horrible.Aside from that, I have nothing but good things to say about this medication for me personally. I've only ever taken 100mg or more so I don't know how different the lower dosages are, but it will take quite a bit of getting used to. Additionally, you can't take it too late or else you might be a zombie the next day. Everyone's body is different, but you definitely should be aware of what time you take it at.If you can get past the intense sleepiness, and this medication is something you genuinely need, I do recommend it personally.",amy

I honestly felt like a hopeless case seeing as I've been on Invega, Zyprexa, Abilify, Clozaril, Rexulti, Loxapine, and Resperidol. Every single one of these medications made me extremely tired. I would sleep for days only to get up to have a meal or use the washroom in some cases I was sleeping 23 hours a day.. but then I tried Seroquel XR. Within days I started feeling alive again and didn't even get the sleepiness side effect. I feel so calm and clear on this drug.

I still hear voices everyday, but it is not anymore so devastating experience and this medicine helped me to live with this disease and voices, which it is most of the time an annoying detail of my life and I see more criticism of their advices. There is still more voices in stressful situations. In such situations I sometimes use 100mg more and it helps quite fast. It really improved my life. From side effects I don’t see much, but I use it before sleep, so during a day for sure it would make me sleepy. My blood results and weight are fine but often at the night at the moment when quetiapine starts making me sleepy I have suddenly crazy craving to eat something sweet. Without quetiapine after 9 years I think that there would be problem to get into sleep. It was big step forward to start managing with disease. Heads up people and I wish you the best.",Average Joe

Once I threw up breakfast because my body was just not working yet. And I was always putting guilt on me, because I didn't know that this is pill side effect. I used to think I am lazy, because I couldn't wake up. When having job, I always needed someone who woke me up, because I always turned off the alarm unaware, while sleeping. Only now when I changed pills and can normally wake up I see that I am not lazy and I am very happy for that fact! Another side effect was muscles cramps in legs - when I went to bed, I couldn't stay still, I had to move my legs because of some weird ""muscle tightens"". This happened occasionally.

Once I started taking Seroquel anxiety and restless leg syndrome disappeared and I’m feeling the best I’ve felt in a long time.

I have lost some of it by reducing calories and taking metformin. Walking seems to help too.If you do take this one, stay as active as you can to avoid diabetes because as my psychiatrist told me ""It will happen eventually""Also, I adopted a vegatarian diet to help lower other risks with this one.The other downside is that it can make you very tired. I take 400mg at night and 75mg in the morning and another 75mg in the afternoon.I still hear voices and don't want to be around other people but it is much more manageable and I can at least have some kind of life.To be honest, I probably would have killed myself if it were not for this drug.I am surprised I even wrote this as I am a very paranoid person.",Mrmeds
26,Quetiapine,Schizophrenia,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 18, 2019",6,"Was on haloperidol for many years and was somewhat helpful with main  schizophenia symptoms, but my psychiatrist was worried about tardive dyskinesia as Haldol use has a high incidence of TD. I switched to quetiapine (Seroquel) and many of the remaining psychotic symptoms went away and my confidence came back and I had energy and fell asleep easily and slept well. I was more social and less socially anxious. Months down the road, I realized I had mania. It started to cause problems with my relationships because I talked TOO much, and became much too task oriented, less sensitive to my family's feelings, and was agitated. Mania makes you feel great, but it really isn't a good thing. AH started presenting again, so I upped my quetiapine to double the dose (under supervision). Now TD seems to presenting significantly. I love quetiapine, but it has a lot of upsides and downsides.",You are not Alone

I began having unusual twitches in the face, odd numb feelings too, so I spoke to them and they said not to worry it's a normal side effect - ok then, I'll take that.2 weeks later I am struggling to speak, my sentences stop in their tracks and my throat tightens up, my heart was fluttering and pounding all day so we visit the ER. I am sent home given the ""It's just anxiety"".2 hours later I have a seizure and this induced an SVT (or vice versa, the cardiologist can't say for sure) which brought my pulse up to 248bpm, I struggle to get oxygen and in resuscitation I begin having a cardiac arrest and am given cardioversion.This medication may work wonders, but if you are one of the unluckly few who suffer cardiac problems, take caution of any symptoms.",spenc11

29,Quetiapine,Schizophrenia,1.0,,"May 15, 2019",8,"Seroquel XR (quetiapine):I started taking this when I was 12 years old  and the entire time I was on it, I gained probably like 40-60 pounds. But I was some what over weight at the time so probably thought not much about it. I would miss school because my mom had a death wish if she woke me up. It made me tired and foggy for days. Last October my mom woke me up just a few hours after taking it. And I couldn't even comprehend what she was saying. So along with the schizophrenia I also have sleep apneaI stop breathing in my sleep, thank god I can figure it out pretty fast and wake up. On seroquel it's impossible and also makes it worse. Even after more then ten years I really hate this medication. I haven't taken it for a for maybe a year or more. But they still prescribe it.  They started me on Abilify which. I recommend for anyone with schizophrenia or B.L.P. or B.P. because  Abilify does work, and it works fast and also it doesn't cause any sleeping problems  or drowsiness.

Restless legs at night are awful. At my next appointment I’m switching to another drug because I can’t handle these side effects!

It's addictive because when you stop taking it you'll never be able to sleep again. There's no getting off of it. I sleep in till 2 to 5 pm every day. I'm sluggish all day. It never helped with any of my symptoms of schizophrenia. It makes me crave sugar immensely. This drug is very dangerous. You have to be very careful when taking it. Don't drive or be around people you don't know or trust. Let's just say I could sleep through anything. This drug should be illegal even if it does help some people with their mental illness. There are other things people can take. Risperdal for example does wonders for me. I'm working with my doctor on getting off of Seroquel. I didn't do it sooner because I'm so sick I can barely accomplish anything really. I just want to say to all schizophrenics I'm so sorry.

A side effect is that it’s an appetite suppressant, or at least that’s how it effects my daughter.  She currently takes  100 mg a day and is back down to her regular weight.

At lower doses, it is good for anxiety. You don't feel like a zombie on it. Obviously it helps you sleep, but at lower doses you won't be sleepy or if you just take it at bed time. Abilify and Haldol turned me into a complete zombie it was terrible. Risperdal had sexual side effects and of course the breast growth issue, but I would say Risperdal is the second best one behind Seroquel. Haldol and Abilify help paranoia big time but they also exasperate anxiety, definitely stay away from those. Geodon and Zyprexa are worse than those medicines.
