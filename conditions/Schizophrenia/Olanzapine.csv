1,Olanzapine,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 30, 2022",4,"Zyprexa (olanzapine):Zyprexa immediately helped me 16 years ago when my delusions started. (I was 25 then). After that first episode my doctor quit Zyprexa after 5 years of remission. But a year after, my delusions started again and again Zyprexa helped me. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia then. It has been 16 years now that I am on 5 mg and the only side effect is moderate weight gain. I tried Latuda just recently, but it was a nightmare. When I switched back to Zyprexa everything got back to normal. Of course I keep trying to eat healthy all these years. Honestly, Zyprexa and my doctor saved my life. Keep being  positive every minute and every day!",Amy

3,Olanzapine,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 7, 2022",2,"Zyprexa (olanzapine):Prescribed in late 2020 and took until about June of 2021. Zyprexa certainly has some side effects to be aware of - weight gain hit the hardest, gaining 30 pounds in just a few months after staying the same weight my whole life. However, there were several benefits that lead to me asking to be placed back on it. I can sleep easier (though make sure to set alarms, you will sleep DEEP), my mind is less chaotic, no hallucinations or psychosis symptoms while on it. Zyprexa reduced my suicidal thoughts by a lot. I have been on many psychiatric medications in my life and low dose (5 mg) of Zyprexa has by far been the most helpful. Just be aware of the weight gain and risk of muscle spasms. Generally I am pretty anti medication, but after insomnia for years on top of paranoid schizophrenic thoughts, Zyprexa was a blessing. If bipolar or depression, I would not suggest this med immediately - shop around a bit with mood stabilizers and antidepressants before jumping to an antipsychotic.",Finn

I got this garbage back in March of this year for schizophrenia and anxiety, I took it once on March 28 and I had a horrible experience! I was super sleepy, more annoyed and hungry like a bottomless pit! I went from a small cute 123 lbs where I was in shape and everything where I looked my BEST so far in my adult life and my weight went all the way up to 178!! I feel so gross now. I weighed 178 by May 1 of this year due to eating MEALS every 5 minutes. I didn’t take this ever since until yesterday. For the past 2 weeks I’ve been experiencing Ativan withdrawal where I was paranoid than usual, dreamlike and lashing out at everyone. I took this yesterday and I felt WORSE!!! MORE paranoid, enraged, very sleepy I kept scrunching my face and wanted to go to sleep even in public, 4 night terrors in one night, insanely hungry.

I was on it for more than 5 months and gained 40 lbs! I was only on 5 mg and for a few months was even advised to half my dose! This medication made me feel irritated, flat, and moving around was heavier than usual. I became paranoid and had delusions but didn’t believe them. I just wanted to stay in bed, or not leave the house. The voices told me unbelievable thoughts and I worried a lot too. It did help me sleep. The voices did become more non existent or lowered; however, at times I could still hear them lowered to an extent. The weight gain is not worth it!  I use to be so active and weighed 125 before I started Zyprexa. Now I am 170lbs! I need a new medication to help the auditory hallucinations that will not repeat my thoughts aloud, or lower them. I tried Vraylar at 1.5 mg. The auditory hallucinations completely went away; however the side effects sent me to the hospital. Please help!!!",Candypillsfix

For me, the drug was a life ruining experience.  When I was on it, (for a psychotic episode) I had severe side-effects, including sedation, emotional numbing and life threatening metabolic deterioration.  With a psychiatrist's help, I cross-titrated from it to Latuda.  However, I happened to be in the fraction of people that has severe repercussions from discontinuing Zyprexa.  With withdrawal, I had severe insomnia, which half a year later, has only mildly improved.  I have had to be on Ativan to get some sleep, and there are many testimonials to the same experience I've had -- Zyprexa can for an indefinite period of time disrupt sleep regulation.  Because of this, it should not be tried unless newer antipsychotics with a more focused receptor profile have been attempted.",bjohn33

I had a very scary problem of not being able to sleep for a long time, resulting in psychosis. This happened twice in my life within a couple years of each other. The first time they put me on haldol and depakote. I was in so much pain I could not move, and at the same time the depakote gave me horrible shakes and no filter when talking. Worst of all I still had a lot of trouble sleeping. I was lucky enough to taper off them completely eventually and my sleep returned to normal.However two years later I lost my job and could not sleep, the same thing happens. I was put on 5mg Zyprexa and 10mg Lexapro. In less than a week I was stable and sleeping (very) well. Yes I gained weight but I have learned to control it. I am now doing well and down to 2.5mg. I think the key is a smaller dosage. I read some people have 15mg, I think I would have a lot of trouble with side effects too if it was that much.
