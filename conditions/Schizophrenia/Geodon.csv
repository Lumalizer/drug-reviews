1,Geodon,Schizophrenia,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 19, 2021",8,"I switched to this medication from olanzapine due to the weight neutral benefit. I did lose 5 pounds, however I had a lot of muscle tension and pain. Voices and hallucinations did not return so I guess it does work for the actual sickness. The muscle pain is too much so I will be trying another more tolerable med.",Anonymous

3,Geodon,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 9, 2020",7,Geodon was a BAD DRUG for me!!! Made me gain a bunch of weight and didn't even touch my symptoms. I was put on this during my second hospitalization and got up to a really high dose and still didn't work but was kept on it after discharge. Caused my moods to be really unstable and led to a misdiagnosis of bipolar. Made me feel like such a zombie and made me miss Abilify which also made me a zombie but Geodon was so much worse. Beware!,Rose
4,Geodon,Schizophrenia,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 24, 2020",14,"I have been on Geodon for 9 months now and though I have lost 30 pounds of the Risperdal weight I gained I am now experiencing  a condition called Anhedonia and I am absolutely ruined.

6,Geodon,Schizophrenia,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 28, 2019",11,"This medicine can cause unwanted sleepiness. Going out in public in the middle of the afternoon, I experienced akathisia, restlessness and the desire to sleep. I also get wicked dry mouth every night and head flashes. I still am hearing voices on this medication and am taking 160 mg a day. 80 in the morning and 80 at night. My doctor added on cogentin to help with the akathisia and it makes me feel even sleepier. Also the cogentin causes serious vision blur so much so that my eyes won't focus when I try to read.",Lasllaves
7,Geodon,Schizophrenia,1.0,,"August 29, 2019",9,I started taking Geodon on a Monday.  I  didn't get any sleep even after taking a trazodone still didn't get but 1-2 hours of sleep that night so I decided to skip Tuesday slept like a baby that night  being cautious  I decided to give it another try 1/2 a pill on Wednesday around 7 p.m around 8:30 p.m I started having what I described as a labour pains (no I'm not pregnant) and a migraine but the pains didn't last for more than 3 to mins at a time off and on durning the night but I did get a few hours of sleep. Sometime during the night but Thursday morning I felt good enough to start some minor yard work (raking) I began to get very hot almost  to the point of stripping. Things only got worse the migraines and cramps came back along with hives and the sensation of being stung by a 100000000 all at once so here I'm am now laying in the hospital form a bad reaction from the Geodon having it flushed out of my system so I would never take this medication again ..GOOD LUCK,Kitty21
8,Geodon,Schizophrenia,7.0,,"August 6, 2019",17,"Antipsychotic weight gain is an absolute nightmare.  I was on Risperdal and it made me gain twenty pounds, at first I didn’t know what was going on. I thought I was just getting old. Then I got up to 160 pounds without even eating. This med made it so I can’t pee hardly at all, so if I just want to drink diet pepsi to lose weight I have to deal with water weight. I mean just how big am I supposed to get? I have to be on this stuff for life and I’m gaining about 2 to 3 pounds a week without even eating. How many times am I supposed to go jean shopping for bigger sizes? And I can’t say I trust Geodon much more.  I’ve been on it for a month now, so far I’ve lost five pounds by just starving myself as usual.  It works for my voices but I can’t even get off the stuff If I wanted too because the withdrawal gives me terrible insomnia. So, basically they’ve got you for life and your going to be fat.",Lee
9,Geodon,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 11, 2019",6,"Geodon definitely works for a antipsycotic but if you don't eat with it, it will make you a zombie and you won't get up for hours. When you eat with it, it's a whole different story. Anyways it also makes me so anxious, more than I have even been in my life it messes with my head so bad, for that reason I hate it with a passion and never want to take it again ",Mixedboylol
10,Geodon,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 7, 2018",8,Man I feel better than how I was feeling before. I still hear stuff still but not as bothersome as before. I'd recommend this med  for voices for everyone bruhh,Marquis
11,Geodon,Schizophrenia,3.0,,"November 17, 2018",9,"I have been on Geodon for the last 5 years.  As soon as I started taking the Geodon at 20 mg my sleep started to get disturbed.  I was bumped up to 60 mg and the hallucinations have tapered off.  I still get delusions and feeling that people are talking out of my mouth as my mouth moves with words.  I had initial symptoms of restlessness and anxiety but over time these symptoms have decreased and managed.  I take Geodon with food at 5:30pm and it wires me so I can't sleep at night.  I tried taking Geodon in the morning with food, but sometimes if I don't eat enough food it causes forced drowsiness and unable to do anything but sleep for a couple of hours.  I switched to evening in case the forced drowsiness appeared again.  I found that moderate exercise 5 days a week helps with sleep because Geodon increases DHEA level and when DHEA is elevated, you have sleep issues.  On the fifth year of Geodon, I started to get drug induced Parkinsonism.",Amy
12,Geodon,Schizophrenia,7.0,,"July 2, 2018",15,Geodon is working well for me. My condition is pretty severe and other antipsychotic medications caused what I can only describe as an adverse reaction. It doesn't get rid of all my symptoms but I am on a low dose. What I am most surprised by is it's positive effect on my motivation and my desire to see others...I did not know medication could help that.,Fuzzy
13,Geodon,Schizophrenia,8.0,,"May 4, 2018",20,"Honestly, this medication does a really good job of nipping hallucinations in the bud. It took over a week for the medicine to really work for me, though. The only complaint I have is the fact that this medication makes you so, so tired. It also changes your mood so that I don’t feel like me when I take Geodon. But, it does what it’s supposed to do so I can’t complain too much.",Elle
14,Geodon,Schizophrenia,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 11, 2017",7,I've been on Geodon for 6 months now and its helped me maintain my weight and take away all my symptoms with minimal side effects. I increased my dose to 120mg once a day and now I developed insomnia and can't sleep without taking xanax. I will be forced to switch medications.,Anonymous
15,Geodon,Schizophrenia,1.0,,"August 5, 2017",13,"This is a Zombie drug , causes me to fall and hurt myself , makes me have zero emotions and I hate everyone and want everyone in the world to die ..... would be animal abuse to give it to a pet ......I'm not taking this anymore .",SchizoAffective
16,Geodon,Schizophrenia,1.0,,"February 13, 2017",14,"Friday 2-10-17 I was rushed by ambulance due to respiratory acidosis. I was intubated and stayed in ICU because I took xanex, baclofen, Oxycodone, and clonazepam in conjunction with Geodon. It says do not mix this medicine with those medicines. I did exactly what the Dr told me to do. You have to do your own homework. Be safe.",Bigger Macintosh
17,Geodon,Schizophrenia,10.0,,"December 20, 2016",14,"All I can say, don't miss a dose or take it without food. Also, do not take it with alcohol. If I do any of the above, I don't sleep at all. Then when I take it on the following moarning, I fall asleep at work, which is saying something because I have a very active job. This medicine seems to have a very short half life and I feel symptoms even if  I go  one hour without it. That being said, it is by far the best medicine I have been on. It is very effective when taken at the same time everyday with just enough food. No weight gain, and a big drop in positive symptoms. It even brings back my determination and zest for life. As long as I take it exactly as dirrected, it is a life saver.",Naboo Bear
18,Geodon,Schizophrenia,10.0,,"November 6, 2016",28,I have been  on geodon for 6 years. It works great for me. Rispedal.   made me sleepy and I couldn't think as clear. I have gained weight but due to other medication I was taking with it. My symptoms are almost all gone. I still have some paranoia but nothing like before I take a lot though 160 at night.  My condition is very manageable I just wish I didn't have this problem and didn't have to take medicine just to function normally . Good luck to all you guys searching for help.,Momma Kim
19,Geodon,Schizophrenia,7.0,,"September 11, 2016",7,I've been on geodon for about three weeks now. So far no side effects but it's diffcult to take with 500 calorie meals. I'm not much of a breakfast gal and find myself looking for food to take my medicine in the morning.,Opeeftl
20,Geodon,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 19, 2016",8,Been on it for nearly 2 months now and I Always take it at a time when I have a meal for best effect. No relapce . I do not gained psychosis when having Geodon. And I do not gain weight on it or feel to extremely hungry when having this. But i've got the same problem that actually occurs with those who having ADHD. Among the problems is lower memory and to shut down things that happens on the same time. Have someone else experience problems that remind of adhd on Geodon? AND my dreams on the nights is Not always something to be proud of or try to impress of. I have dream very sick dreams on Geodon. BUT it feels like I can be myself on it to still be the person who I really are. Geodon got 7 of 10. Still good. This is my experience on Geodon,jerko

Almost every night I get this weird, overwhelming feeling, can't sit still and I can only describe it as a panic attack. My benzo doesn't help, all can do is go to bed. I'm only taking 20mg twice a day. I'm scared if I ever need to increase the dosage",Angela07742
23,Geodon,Schizophrenia,6.0,,"May 2, 2016",9,"60mg very effective for psychotic symptoms. Zero weight gain. However, had to come off due to bad side effects. Quite severe depersonalization and jaw pain. As I understand it, this is quite a rare side effect so I wouldn't let it dissuade you. Reactions to antipsychotics are very much on an individual basis. Would recommend despite my personal side effects.",Nance34

25,Geodon,Schizophrenia,1.0,,"January 18, 2016",13,"My doctor changed my drug regimen from abilify to Geodon(120 mg  Then I started experiencing trouble swallowing and headaches. These effects were transient so the doctor asked me to stay on the drug. The condition became worse and I went to an ear, throat, nose doctor. They indicated that I was suffering from GERD and inflammation of the larynx. After a few more weeks I was becoming paranoid and experiencing OCD symtoms. My husband called the doctor and demanded she shift back to abilify. A couple days later all the aforementioned symtoms disappeared. I am sure the drug works for many people but please pay close attention to the side effects I described",rose cuse
26,Geodon,Schizophrenia,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 14, 2015",18,"This is day two of taking 20mg twice daily of geodon. So far I yawn a lot and could fall asleep about 30 mins to an hour after taking it. That I really hate, because I was already always exhausted to begin with BUT I will say I have noticed I'm a lot less paranoid and can actually walk slowly without thinking im being chased, it is rather pleasant, now when I see or hear things I know its just my head and can leave it be and not go into paranoid mode, I really hope the sleepiness subsides",Krispykillz
27,Geodon,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 10, 2015",42,"This medicine, taken in the throes of suicidal ideation changes your thoughts, literally.  After taking an additional 20mg cap, my mind wanders to other, more immediate issues such as things I can do to help myself.  I start thinking about doing activities such as housework, baking, painting, and anything else that gets me back into life and out of my chair playing computer games by the hour.  I think this med is miraculous in the way it draws one away from the depths of despair to functionality.  I have been taking it for several years, prescribed off-brand for clinical depression and have been continually amazed that someone could create a medication that does so much good with virtually no downside.  No hair loss, no weight gain.",CWR01

29,Geodon,Schizophrenia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 11, 2013",38,"I've been on Geodon for probably about a year and I like it. It works I don't really hear voices. From time to time like once a week I'd hear like half a min if voices compared to 24hrs of my day before taking Geodon. My dose is always changing but as of now I'm on 20 in the morning and 80 at night. I get muscle tense and jaw locking. sometimes it will look like I'm flipping people off or I'd hide my thumb and squeeze. I'm taking Benadryl for that which helps, I'm taking 50mg for morning and night. I had tingling in my head feeling like I could faint but that only lasted a month or so.

I have a wild thought process that can imagine anything and make it real in my own mind. That is under control almost completely, which is AMAZING! Living in my head without this medicine was a nightmare. 60mg before bed did not work for me. I couldn't sleep. So, I now take it in the morning. I also have A.D.D. (no medication for A.D.D. though). Just the Geodon and Topamax. - It works perfect for me - Weight Gain was a BIG problem on the other Medicine they tried, so far I think I have lost, I know I have not gained, which is very important to me.

Now I am dead to the world at night but can get through the day. I have been on many medications and Geodon is the only one that didn't make me feel that my life was in danger and claustrophobic. I never did hear voices or delusions, just grandiose thinking. If you have to take medication, Geodon is far superior to the other antipsychotics. I developed partial blindness and tardive dyskinesia on the others. But Geodon does slow you down and cause weight gain.",seasunshine

Within five days, started getting twitches around my mouth and jaw on the seventh day my tongue swollen up, my jaw was locked and had a grape stuck in my mouth (which I was trying to eat). Ended up switching medication. Cant say my experience with it was positive - still have some mouth twitching even now and tightness in the jaw from it.
