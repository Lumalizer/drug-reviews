0,Abilify Maintena,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 16, 2022",8,"I took Invega for  a year and it was a nightmare, depression, erection problems, yellow semen, blood in semen. Two days ago doctor switched me to Abilify Maintena and I have to tell you it is the best drug till now for me, no deep sedation, erection is there, I feel normal again. I have some side effects like little less sleep but it should be only couple days, headaches, nausea but you can feel normal again with smile on your face and great feeling. And also I noticed that I don't want to smoke that much and I read that one guy after one week had no desire on smoking which I can feel already now :) if you feel bad on Invega like I did, maybe give it a try ;)",Danny017
1,Abilify Maintena,Schizophrenia,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 11, 2021",4,"I have a delusional disorder. I had a good experience. Calmed me down to the point I wasn't making rash actions and statements.Benefits: ups your dopamine in the right places, lowers it in the right places (rather than just lowering it altogether).Side Effects: Little to no side effects. There is a slightly dulled, or sedating, sensation... and at the same time, a little restlessness. But unlike when on other antipsychotics, I was able to go about my daily activities (and enjoy them).Dosage: 400 mg, also available in 300 mg injection.Ease of Use: Nurse comes straight to my door to administer. You might have to go to a hospital to get it done if you don't have a nurse.Notes: Combines well with Zoloft (sertraline). HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DRUG IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT TO STAY OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. IF YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THIS AND INVEGA SUSTENNA, ALWAYS TAKE THIS ONE.",Kyra Benjamin
2,Abilify Maintena,Schizophrenia,5.0,,"August 3, 2021",2,"I was hospitalized for having a psychotic episode where I was having delusions and hallucinations. I was originally started on the highest dose of Invega Sustenna but had the dose lowered and was switched over to Abilify Maintena after 5 months once my doctor was convinced I did not have schizophrenia. It completely cured me of my paranoia but left me, like many others here have described, without any emotion or motivation which is why my doctor switched me and lowered my dose after complaining. My doctor said the antipsychotic contributed to maybe 5% of my lethargy and the rest was something else- ie depression/anxiety. In the end, we both agreed 1 year on the antipsychotics was enough. I am now 1 month off and am starting to feel like myself again. I felt the need to post this because not everyone gives updates. The drug worked, but I would not want to be on it for too long. Hang in there if you are coming off it. It does get better-at least for me.",Cdnpatient
3,Abilify Maintena,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"July 31, 2021",1,I am on 300mg injection and experience difficulty breathing and problems with the water works and my face is constantly moving when walking.  I take multiple supplements to counteract the effects of the drug including serra enzyme for my shaking in the arms.  I have been admitted to hospital for low blood sugar and the drug is extremely oppressive to expect me to take it,Joseph9079

I get forced to take this stuff in NH USA. Really nasty stuff. I need help getting rid of it or purifying it.",Enjamin John Gaudreault
5,Abilify Maintena,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 24, 2021",6,I was coerced into taking this injection at a mental hospital where I was told if I did not have it I would be in there for a long time. My only symptoms were depression and anxiety at the time of admission. It is a horrible drug it gave me anhedonia so lack of pleasure. I also had side effects to begin with like constipation and I passed out on. Also had racing thoughts and severe insomnia. AVOID this drug if you can it is awful.,Jes
6,Abilify Maintena,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 13, 2020",23,Went on an episode and relapse and took em away. BUT BE WARNED: it is like working out (as in going to the gym). You take the injection and then you work out your mentality because depression side effects start to kick in. Took away my passion for pretty much anything and I gained 15 pounds. Been on it for 5 months. But also remember that it is different for everybody. My sleep has been horrible but I still sleep for 10-14 hours a day. It makes you careless about your decision so you won't care about what you eat and you will eat a lot since you won't care.,Pho

Now taking this medication I feel somewhat better, really I don't get my self in to so much trouble, like arguing and shouting, but now am calm and confident and can laugh again.",Aby

The AH, VH and TH are all gone, I am able to function without distraction of delusions, and can hold a steady job and take care of my children. I wouldn't be able to do any of this if it weren't for this injection.",advo4her
11,Abilify Maintena,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 26, 2020",14,"This med really hasn't helped my voices at all. I'd say at most it takes the edge off my anger. I had the typical side effects which were pretty bad but I also had what I thought was EPS, extrapyramidal side effects in the form of hand movements. Upon withdrawal of the med I experienced an explosion of tics both motor and vocal. I went back on the med and the tics were a bit better but persisted. They include inappropriate tics and are unpredictable. I'm not a fan of any of the antipsychotics, frankly, but I would be weary of the risk of movement disorders in this med.",Silver

I don’t recommend lowering the dosage because you get tolerance to it. I was very impulsive and erratic before going on this, I’m on disability so I could not even maintain working.  Doing much better thinking clearly and hardly side effects besides tired the first month that is all.",Anonymous
13,Abilify Maintena,Schizophrenia,8.0,,"January 2, 2020",18,"been on some form of abilify injection for 4 years. I have never missed a monthly dose. Started 400mg for 2 years 300mg for 2 years and just got my first 200mg Jan 2020 for schizoeffective disorder . I will never be tapered off but the point in lowering is to maintain stability but at the same time control the insatiable  desire the meds give me to eat. Also to try and get back some of the energy the meds just simply take away - energy to cook , clean , and exercise. I have been trying different meds for 10 years and abilify is my preferred. After refusing those other antipsychotic meds that have literally been around forever , abilify injection seemed to be a happy medium and you don’t have to take a pill everyday (because I know I won’t). If you find being on an anti psychotic indefinitely is your reality , abilify makes things easier. With the injection lasting a month long , it’s very incognito and doesn’t remind you that you are being treated - like taking a pill everyday",Smog
14,Abilify Maintena,Schizophrenia,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 2, 2019",7,I have used the Abilify Maintena for 7-8 months.

I had very little problems with my illness to begin with but my psychiatrist decided to put me on it due to many trouble I have caused to some people a while ago. The drug has had for me very little to 0 therapeutic effect. In fact, now I have less motivation and a big social anxiety. I was before on Xeplion (invega sustenna) and abilify is still a lot better than Xeplion because it has a lot less side effect.",Green bottle

19,Abilify Maintena,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 15, 2019",27,"For my schizophrenia opted in for Abilify Mainena as an alternative to Invega Sustena. Granted that I was on Invega Sustena for between 6-12 months prior with bland emotions at that time, I did some research and gave Abilify Maintena a chance. That was late 2014. Now it's early 2019, and I want everyone to know that by this time, I have regained some emotional ability. I am also able to focus on complex tasks with a significantly better ability than I would be without an antipsychotic. I have concerns though. I have a physical standing job and I walk to work, and all I can do is maintain my weight within a 10 pound range. I felt good, and the Abilify Maintena kept me resilient when things got tough. For the record, I used to have suicidal thoughts long before starting Abilify Maintena, but I never contemplated it while on it.One last thing: I have always taken a low dosage of Abilify Maintena. I do not ever recommend medium or high dosages to start with.",Duduk Fan
20,Abilify Maintena,Schizophrenia,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 11, 2019",15,"So I've been on this Abilify Injection (against my will) for a couple of years because my family just wants me to be normal again. And man, do I feel normal! It's so great! (I was being sarcastic...really, really sarcastic) I can't sleep for more than a couple hours at a time, I suffer from persistent psychological pain due to anxiety/restless leg, and I have gained 70 lbs! And there's more! If I keep taking it, I'll probably wind up with diabetes! What a great drug to give a permanently disabled veteran to ensure that they live a long, peaceful life!Seriously though...It's terrible. Low quality of life in exchange for little to no psychotic symptoms...Bad Trade. Find something else that works for your condition!!!!!!",A Guy

23,Abilify Maintena,Schizophrenia,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 6, 2018",12,"I was put on this injection, after my insurance wouldn't cover any other injection other than prolixin. I was covered for this injection through the Prelapse Study. Now if anyone has ever been on Prolixin, you should know that the effect are extremely bad so being on Abilify Maintena was a god send.It overall changed me completely to where I am functioning at a normal state, and haven't been in the hospital since I have been put on this injection.I do have some side effect from the injection, which most notably is the uncontrollable muscle movments, which I am uncertain if this is unreleated to the drug itself or if I have a form of tourette's. Also I did notice some uncontrollable urges in spending money/gambling, more than what I thought I would have normally done.Overall to be honest, the benefits out weight the cons in my concern.",A A Ron

If you don't mind sleeping all day , gaining weight , breaking out with zits , becoming a total zombie and doing nothing productive with your life at all this is the drug for you. Hearing voices is not so bad in comparison to how bad this drug makes you feel and the want to gambling your life savings away. The second the injection enters your blood you instantly feel greasy.
