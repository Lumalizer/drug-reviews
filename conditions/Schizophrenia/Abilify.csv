This medicine has improved my style of living a lot. Before using  Risperidone I used to be very lazy, after switching to Abilify my laziness turned into more activeness, now I go to gym regularly and walk 10Km's a day, but there is one problem which I have not been able to manage that is, Abilify has caused me sleep disturbance which is not going away, it has been two months now I couldn't sleep properly.",Zia931
1,Abilify,Schizophrenia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 14, 2022",1,"I just got prescribed this yesterday and I took it today thinking it will be a great drug compared to the Zyprexa I came off of a few months ago. BOY was I wrong!!! This medication was GODAWFUL!! 20 minutes after I took it I started feeling insanely tired then that turned into extreme sleepiness and drowsiness, I became weak, I had severe akathisia, was insanely angry and irritable, I had hallucinations , vomiting and diarrhea. I quit cold Turkey. Most of the side effects wore off even though I took a nap but I still feel tired like I need to nap. Never again 0/10. I took this in 2012 when I was 13 but I don’t remember it being this awful. Terrible medication",Nutella
2,Abilify,Schizophrenia,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 4, 2022",3,"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia when I was 30 years old after experiencing significant psychosis. I was initially placed on olanzapine (Zyprexa) and although it helped considerably and enabled me to leave hospital, I suffered from side effects including fatigue, dry mouth and found it almost impossible to get motivated. I then moved onto Abilify and the difference was like night and day.I'm more sociable, active, responsible, clean and I'm able to hold down a very demanding career. I don't credit all of this to Abilify, but it certainly helped and played a huge part. I found it difficult to remember to take my dose each day and a few times the symptoms of psychosis started to return after long periods of not taking the medication. In response, I decided to go for the monthly injections and I haven't looked back!There is only one side effect that really bugs me and that is severe akathisia - Though I've found Benztropine fixes that 100%.",Anonymous

Before I started taking it I was losing my mind, thought people were after me, heard thoughts and saw visions.  Basically I was not functional and couldn’t hold a job.  All of this has gone away over the years and now I am a functioning adult.  It regulates my sleep and moods, too.  The side effects are minimal but noticeable.  I developed type 2 diabetes even though I maintain a regular exercise schedule and eat right.  Also, I have no sex drive and it kind of screws up your all of your sexual functions.  Also, beware of these medications and take them only if you have to have them.  I developed something called tardive akathisia when I tried to stop taking Abilify.  It is an absolutely horrible side effect caused by your brain trying to return to the way it originally worked and it is truly awful. Look it up!",Mike

I was not in control of my emotions I cried hysterically all the time. I had to be put on something similar to Xanax because I guess my mouth moved uncontrollably. I developed a gambling problem and was out of control with a lot of different things all at one time. I couldn’t stop any of this behavior and it was tormenting. I wasn’t able to cope either.

29,Abilify,Schizophrenia,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 26, 2020",51,"When I was first diagnosed with psychosis, about six years ago, they put me on risperidone. It was only recently that I discovered that, for all that time, even a moderate dose like 3.5mg/night was making me sleepy ALL DAY, I had no motivation, I became completely inert, I gained a lot of weight, maybe 50 or so pounds, which is a lot for my height. They recently switched me to abilify, and I’ve gotta say, it’s a hundred times better! I’m back to being up, I’m interested in things again, in being productive, I can even work. As for the weight, it doesn’t give me the appetite that risperidone did, nor does it mess up my blood sugar levels like risperidone did. There’s still a bit of fatigue, but my concerta, prescribed for ADD, nips that in the bud, and besides, even without the c, the fatigue levels are just nowhere near risperidone levels. TL;DR in terms of fatigue, motivation levels and weight gain, abilify is, by FAR, the better choice over risperidone.",Endersmom

That part is mildly annoying.  However, I have noticed a slight increase in energy level or the ability to just get up and take my dog out for walks and have started to get more motivated to actually get stuff done around the house, which off medication was very hard for me to do.  I’ve had no weight gain, or any other side effects yet but I have only been on it for a week.  20 mg is a high dose to start at but it’s what the hospital gave me so it’s what I’m taking.

I believed incredible grandiose religious delusions, believed my television sets had cameras in them and believed when people coughed or made sounds they were mocking me subliminally.  I didn't receive treatment until the age of 30 and was working full time but getting myself in wreckless situations.  After I lost everything I have besides my awesome family, I was put on a Community Treatment Order (CTO)  and after 4 months on Invega I was extremely suicidal and thought I'd never regain my normal  life.

It started out as just a simple free code bonus for online casinos. It then turned into a full blown addiction. Drawing my bank account anytime I got paid down to 1-0 dollars trying to win. Always chasing my losses. It has gotten to the point where I started opening credit cards for more and more gambling. I have finally put my foot down and said NO More!

At first the doctors put me on 10mg which I hated because the dose was too high ( thinking about it now) . Then my doctor raised it to 20mg which was just making me even more emotionless. So I switched back to risperidone consta (injection), but I've always hated risperidone consta, so I thought my life was over. But then I noticed I had a full pack of abilify left over from before. So I decided to take just small dose of Abilify along side the risperidone consta, and guess what? The Abilify is great at such a small dose. It completely blocks the side effects of risperidone and I can live a greater life now. So I take  Abilify and have risperidone injection every 2weeks.",Huystread 2222

My body fat % came down from 22% to 20% in a couple of months, but hasn't gone lower after that.  It's disheartening to see all that hard work yielding not so great results, which further affects my motivation to exercise considering I'm not seeing any more results.  So this med hasn't been weight neutral for me (compared to baseline wt.) although I didn't gain any more weight on it either.",The Mad King
58,Abilify,Schizophrenia,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 25, 2016",52,"Abilify 20 mg.I am a patient diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia, depression,  schizoaffective disorder, bipolar.  I have experienced a sensitivity to my emotions, as well as how I react to my feelings.  I really don't feel out of the normal with any ""sexual frustration""...and I wouldn't say this has increased/decreased.  I feel less anxious on the medication, and seemingly more at ease with myself when I take this medication.  It is a hard step to have people telling you that you actually do better on this pill, when half your life ago, you didn't have ""mental illness"", and suddenly you become someone else.   My weight did fluxuate when on this drug.  But I feel it was due to stress factors outside of a regular environment.  I feel if you place yourself in good surroundings and support you do much better at being the person you are here to be.  I am so much happier in life with a routine.  I feel like I only referred to enlongated periods of sleep because of depression, and events surrounding certain time frames hence thoughts, and reactions.Abilify (aripiprazole) My instant reaction from this drug is concern for my well-being.  I am nervous because I am one of the people taking this drug till the stars fade, every day to my last.  My doctors all seem to say the same thing, and that is, ""This medication is working for you"".  I do blood tests when I go into the Hospital freqently, and they are not finding anything off the charts and everything is always normal with my vitals. My thought is, how do they consider this medication works for me?  Because I am not showing side effects?  Because I am accepting?  I feel I have to hold patience, my own value, what I care about around me to help better myself mentally and my virtue.  I feel that I am just not the type of person to curbside answers to things we wonder deeply about, I guess.  I don't know if there are any people who would agree then that I should ask if there are any women who have taken abilify during a pregnancy?  Just wondering what the reaction is...  Is my question?  I am a 30 year old female diagnosed with Mental Illness starting in 2004.  I started to take Abilify 20 mg. in 2004 to present.  Overall, since this medication has not been threatening to me, I feel I should embrace it.",Kora1986
