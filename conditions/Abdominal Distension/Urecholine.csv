0,Urecholine,Abdominal Distension,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 2, 2021",0,"Severe abdominal cramps due to Crohn’s inflammation, probably kidneys infected as well. With all that misery going on, you’d think I had bigger concerns than an urgent need to urinate. Nope. I had to go and I was going hose down the ER if I didn’t. Urecholine had me going like a champion racehorse within 20 minutes. No adverse reactions (how would I know?) if only the surgery the next day been as simple. Oh, well. It was long ago and life is never easy.",Pokerface
