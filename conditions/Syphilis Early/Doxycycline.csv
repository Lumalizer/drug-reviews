0,Doxycycline,Syphilis Early,9.0,,"October 16, 2019",10,"Asked the ex if he was touching anyone else - NO, no, no. Yeah right. Fast forward, he calls me from jail TELLING ME (basically BRAGGING!) that he’s tested positive for chlaymydia, ghonorrhea, and SYPHYLLIS!! I saw my GP - who referred me to (the best) OBGYN - I asked my GP to treat me for the chlaymydia & ghonorrhea (before the results!) 2 wks later my OBGYN tells me I came back positive for CHLAYMYDIA ONLY. How dirty IS my ex?! I asked to be treated with the doxy (no bloodwork - I have a major needle phobia!) It’s been great! Take the doxy WITH FOOD! - AVOID DAIRY & CAFFEINE - DRINK WITH A *FULL* GLASS OF WATER (IMPORTANT!) - DRINK PLENTY of water throughout the day - I experienced very bad neck and shoulder/muscle pain & took 2 extra strength Advil & one Tylenol 3 - this helped a TON. REMEMBER- partner could GET U & unborn baby/baby VERY SICK - (blindness, organ failure!) JUST BECAUSE THEY -SAY- they're NOT running around - DOES *NOT* mean that they AREN'T! take care!!!",DNT TRUST UR PARTNER!
