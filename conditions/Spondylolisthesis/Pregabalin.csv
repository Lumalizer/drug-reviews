3,Pregabalin,Spondylolisthesis,5,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 18, 2019",18,"Was taking Lyrica for 5 years. It is a lifesaver for me. I just went to pick up my medicine and was given a generic Pregabalin made by Novadoz. It has to be brand new. I have taken two today to no relief at all. In fact I have bad pains in my calves. I am pretty upset. The pharmacist did not even tell me. I just thought it was a new bottle for Lyrica. I’m gonna try it and see further if it works. If anyone has switched to this, please share your results. Thanks.",Jamie
4,Pregabalin,Spondylolisthesis,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 5, 2019",4,"My doctor prescribed me pregabalin to treat my sciatica, spinal stenosis, spondylithesis, rheumatoid and osteoarthritis and chronic back and knee pain. It did nothing for my severe pain and gave me terrible side effects just like gabapentin and other similar medicines. Including sleepiness, weird overall feeling, anxiety, dystonia and similar reactions. It is used off-label to treat back conditions and pain with no efficient evidence that it works any better for most painful back conditions compared to placebo in clinical trials. Many people get addicted to pregabalin and gabapentin yet they have replaced way more effective opiate medications for pain and have way more dangerous side effects. That is just nuts!!",Kat
5,Pregabalin,Spondylolisthesis,6,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 6, 2018",3,I started on the low dose of 75mg twice daily and did not feel any benefit from it. As have not yet been on Pregablin dose of 150 mg daily  it has not been long enough to feel the effects of it   I wait with crossed fingers and hope.,Backpain+
