0,Gabapentin,Spondylolisthesis,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 10, 2022",1,"I feel that gabapentin has helped me in many ways.  I have RLS, post brain tumor seizures, hot flashes, spondylsisthesis, itching, anxiety and since being on this medication all have improved.  Would highly recommend it and I have minimal side effects.  I take 100mg BID.  A dermatologist gave me RX as she said it would help the irritated nerve endings that were causing quite a bit of itching and I have had this super success.",TGES
1,Gabapentin,Spondylolisthesis,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 5, 2021",0,If you don't have nerve involvement this med will not work for you. I couldn't work without it. I have massive pain in my back and back of my legs and leg weakness. It works for me so I can somewhat function.,Belle
2,Gabapentin,Spondylolisthesis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 13, 2021",4,"100mg 3x daily. A miracle! Have horrible nerve pain left leg to the toes. Burning, tingling, icy, hot, numb, pain all at the same time. Cannot sit or lay flat. Not sleeping. I’m amazed this worked. What a relief. Now I can do physical therapy. I experience a little dizziness 10 min after ingestion. I was happy to note others have trouble remembering words, slight forgetfulness. I was becoming concerned. Glad its a side effect and not something else much worse",Vlngrl
3,Gabapentin,Spondylolisthesis,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2021",12,"It was prescribed to me during an ER visit.  I have discs that have moved sideways and are pressing on my spinal column. So they prescribed this medication.  300mg x3 daily.  It is completely ineffective.   I'm feeling depressed.  I have chest pain and heart palpitations.   My pain level has increased if anything and these side effects are no joke. Now I'm finding out that this stuff can be addictive and very dangerous if you stop taking it cold turkey.  That's not a situation that I agreed to.  I feel that this was a push by a health care facility or provider to get their gift from a pharmaceutical company.  When I heal, I will certainly be addressing this with an attorney.   I just read that this drug, has not been proven effective for my condition.   In fact, data shows the opposite.",HerReview
4,Gabapentin,Spondylolisthesis,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 7, 2019",7,"Mr GP would never have thought of gabapentin. Just NSAIDS. Then, not happy I was up to 2,400mg/day with ZERO relief. Only my psychiatrist had the necessary knowledge to suggest gabapentin. Started out slowly but quickly moved to 1,800mg/day. Great results!",Ed
5,Gabapentin,Spondylolisthesis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 5, 2018",19,"Be cautious when upping dose.... I've just come off 4 tablets three times a day. Genuinely couldn't think very straight and found myself wondering around and forgetting the reason as to why I went into a room etc. For some reason I get heel pain when taking these, I've never had any pain in my heels during my life. Reading people take these ""for heel pain"" is very confusing. I have also experienced a lot of leg weakness in both legs.... also a couple of times around 20 minutes after taking gabapentin my legs had become floppy. I find it all weird, I'd like to find out more about the science behind the pills.... big variety of reasons why perscribed and different affects. Just thought I'd share my experience.✌",Jay
6,Gabapentin,Spondylolisthesis,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 26, 2017",15,"""I have spondylolisthesis, L4/L5-S1, 2 bulging discs, and stenosis. After my 2nd fusion surgery I was prescribed Gabapentin. I found I would forget what I was talking about in the middle of a sentence, and acute disorientation! I remember I had just finished paying for my groceries and the next thing I knew I woke up in the ER! I guess I became very disoriented in the store. I was fine after ""waking"" & took a taxi back to the store. I had NO CLUE what had happened! About a week later I was heading to physical therapy, blacked out and hit a tree, totalling my car. I suspected the Gabapentin, as that was the only ""new med"" for me. I was told it was making me irritable and combative (still don't remember that). I quit taking it & problem gone!",Anonymous
7,Gabapentin,Spondylolisthesis,5,,"December 19, 2016",8,"I also have 2 benign tumours on my S1 and Coccyx. I've been on Tramadol for 2 yrs giving some temporary relief, it also helped me out of bed in the morning. I was put on Gabapentin about 8 months ago. It's been slowly titrated up, I hadn't really felt any relief until I hit the dosage of 900mgs X 3 daily- with my doctor wanting to take me off Tramadol I felt I had no choice but to up my doses. I've gained 45 lbs in the last year and I pretty much have to starve myself to lose a couple of pounds. Do I put up with the weight gain and some relief or switch drugs?  I'm in Alberta, getting a new doctor is almost impossible. I was told to hang on by friends- but for how long?",Anonymous
8,Gabapentin,Spondylolisthesis,2,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 28, 2016",8,"I'm not sure what I have. But, neither do seventeen doctors I've seen in the last twelve years. This sounds more like what may be wrong. I have been on Gabapentin for over four years. I take 800 mgs up to 8 times a day along with 800 mgs of ibuprofen. So far, no side effects. But, no relief from pain. I had a bone spur removed from my inner spine. Praying that would help.  No. Physical Therapy hasn't helped. I'm still looking for answers. But, this spondylolisthesis, might be something to share.",Nauni
9,Gabapentin,Spondylolisthesis,9,,"June 1, 2016",21,"Had L4-5 fusion in 2014 and was back to full time work in 8 weeks. Approximately 22 months later I started having right lower leg excruciating pain and my leg would get so stiff that I would limp along with stinging,burning, and numbness. I went back to see my physician and an MRI was done. I was placed on 300 MG of gabapentin the dose was then increased to 600 mg. After finding out the problem and prior to surgery I was placed on 800 mg three times a day. It has really worked for the numbness,tingling, and burning before and after surgery.  I can really tell a difference if I happen to miss taking it late. I return for my follow up appointment soon I will discuss with my physician about staying on this medication.",Reerees2u
10,Gabapentin,Spondylolisthesis,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 15, 2016",30,"I have spondylolisthesis, L4/L5, 2 bulging discs, moderate stenosis. Started in August and suffered until January. Had 2 injections which didn't work.  Pain medication wasn't working. I am on neurontin 900mg three times a day with ibuprofen 800 mg three times a day. I didn't taper it up like I was supposed to. So had side effects but only 1 day. Side effects were dizziness, trouble  talking. It was sort of funny though. But I went from not being able to walk or get out of bed without crippling pain that made me scream to almost no pain. I was able to work again, sit for longer periods of time and join the human race. It has now been 2 months and it is still working. I was within weeks of having a fusion. Hope it keeps working",kimpadd1962

I had a convulsion affter feeling not needing air my legs gave out on me and I blacked out!!!

I'm having trouble swallowing anything thinking chunky, I just went through esophagus xrays and testing they say it may be the medicine I can't eat rarely eat in dehydrated but don't wanna go back to Dr again.",Sunnyyynseaside
12,Gabapentin,Spondylolisthesis,6,,"August 28, 2015",23,"I've had arthritis for over 30 yrs, which has developed into stenosis & sciatica w/spondylolistesis which means I have no fluid in my disc.  Just found our thru on MRI that this is what's pinching on my sciatica nerve, the disc.  Was in so much pain for three weeks I couldn't walk without help.  Now am taking the gabapentin an am glad to finally be sleeping better instead of getting up every hour.  Can't say that it's totally helped.  Started out taking 300 mg 3 times a day.  Just up to 600 mg 3 times a day.  The gabapentin has seemed to improve my mood.  I'm just happy to be sleeping.  Hope to get more relief with the increase in mg's before I have surgery.","Linda, 59 yrs old"
