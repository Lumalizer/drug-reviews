0,Levofloxacin,Epididymitis Sexually Transmitted,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 16, 2020",5,"After two doses levofloxacin immediately had terrible tendon pain in 4 places. Pain is still intense after 5 days. Hoping it will go away, but according to the inserts in the packaging of the medication it can be permanent. Issue is - I am a landscaper - - and I may need to take off work for a long time - no pay - and its because of this stupid drug.",Arthur
