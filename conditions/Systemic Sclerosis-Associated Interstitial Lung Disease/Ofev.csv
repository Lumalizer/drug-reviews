0,Ofev,Systemic Sclerosis-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease,7,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 16, 2021",4,"I have systemic sclerosis and silicosis, I take 2160 mg of myfortic each day and have been on Ofev for about 18 months 150 mg 2x per day. Oxygen at night and during exertion. Surprised I have a stomach left between both of these drugs.  The myfortic has stopped the schleroderma and despite the side effects has helped tremendously.  The jury is still out on Ofev. My morning coughing has diminished since taking Ofev but lung function generally remains unchanged. Definitely have gastro intestinal side effects from both drugs but it's better than dying in a few years. I can still work and will retire in about 2 years.",Pal
