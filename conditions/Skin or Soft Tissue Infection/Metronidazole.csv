0,Metronidazole,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2020",5,"Flagyl (metronidazole):Absolutely awful reaction to this drug, Flagyl have never been so sick on any medication. Was prescribed for a puncture wound to avoid infection but honestly cannot say if it worked or not although the infection was prevented. However I was completely dysfunctional with side effects from the flagyl including shocking headache, sore throat, hallucinations, dizziness, sore back, upset stomach, sinus reaction, and extreme fatigue.",WildWood
1,Metronidazole,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 17, 2019",0,"So I’m on day 2 of combined 3 x 400mg Metronidazole and 2 x 100mg Doxycycline post-op, having had a marsupialisation of a Bartholin cyst. I have two weeks of the antibiotics to complete. At the moment I’d say there’s zero chance of me getting that far. Despite taking the prescribed dose part way through each meal (that I’ve been able to stomach), with a large glass of water, I’ve had terrible indigestion, nausea and headache. I feel just awful. Definitely not for me. Doc’s tomorrow to seek alternatives",Anonymous

It's working on the infection, but after three days I was itching horribly, mainly on my face.  That has mostly subsided, but now the nausea is getting intense.

5,Metronidazole,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,,"August 11, 2017",1,"I had a very severe reaction to the drug.  It started after two doses (1 day).  My skin erupted in small blisters.  That night the whole of my skin erupted with not only the blisters but also very large welts and extreme reddening of the skin all over my body all of which itched more than I have ever experienced before.  In the middle of the night I took a bath to try to alleviate the itching.  It didn't.  I then took an anti histamine which controlled the itching but only now after a week have the blisters finally started to disappear, even though I only took two doses of the drug.  It was an extremely unpleasant and frightening experience.",maryt70
6,Metronidazole,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,,"July 16, 2017",1,"I was given 10 days worth of tablets by my GP, On the second I could not eat anything, just thinking of food would make me extremely sick, but the worst thing was not being unable to Drink anything, I couldn't even put a glass of water to my mouth without throwing up, which eventually got to point when I had to go to A&E and be put on a saline drip to re-hydrate me. Dizziness, a feeling of being -out of it- was horrible, and the fatigue was awful. I stopped taking the pills, against my GP's advice because I couldn't take anymore. I will never accept this medication again, I'm two days without it, and still can't eat anything, and am forcing myself to drink fluids",laralaralara

8,Metronidazole,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 21, 2015",3,"Flagyl (metronidazole):I was put on this drug, intravaneously, following emergency surgery for an anal abcess.  When I awoke in the hospital several hours after surgery, the first reaction felt like hot, fluid fire being poured down my throat...burning my mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach.  After that, I immediately began havid horrid hallucinations...saw several dark, death shadows hovering over me and flying across the ceiling and walls.  I immediately called the nurse and told her about the symtoms, and insisted that she remove all IVs (she wasn't very symphathetic).  I finally slept for a couple of hours, but when I awoke, I had an awful metallic taste in my mouth that lasted for 2 weeks after I was released.",Boomer53
9,Metronidazole,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,8,,"September 14, 2011",11,"Diagnosed with Rosacea-I have taken this medicine for almost 60 days now 250 mg twice a day. It seemed to surface all blemishes small and papuls within 40 days and my face broke out horribly. It is now healing and I see the light. I must have had all that trapped underneath my skin for a long time, it was a cleansing of sorts. I am almost done with my prescription and I hope my skin will heal quickly. I am able to do another course of the medicines but will see how my skin heals for a few weeks first. I had no real side effects, urgency to urinate at times and I drank a lot of water and cranberry juice. Give it a shot, nothing else worked for me.",E.N.
