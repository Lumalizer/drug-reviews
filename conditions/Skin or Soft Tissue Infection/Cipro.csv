0,Cipro,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2018",5,"I have a petty mean case of cellulitis.  I was prescribed cipro 2x's daily.  The first day I took it, some of the redness seemed to lighten up, my body had aches all over, but I was still willing to proceed to get rid of the deep nasty pain of the infection. Can not use NSAIDS on cipro - so tylenol 4 times daily it was.  Tylenol only worked about 2 hours and the pain was back plus.  3 days in the redness was growing and an ulcer had now formed.  I kept taking it.  I called my doctor on the 6th day and was told to keep taking the cipro.  8 full days and 1 half day later I was in ER.  They scanned my leg, abscess is forming.  WBC is higher than the previous week - it is doing nothing but making more pain all over my body.  D/C Cipro and now on to Cephalexin 500MG 4 times a day.  Man I hope something works fast!",Betty Too
