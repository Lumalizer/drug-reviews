0,Clarithromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 16, 2021",0,To start with it was OK till day 5 came around and my nose dried out and got clogged. I'm not very happy I was given this drug to take. Also when I have a drink to get rid of the dryness it does not take dryness away it makes my stomach upset really badly. It did start to clear my sinuses then now made me feel really crap. Never again have complained to doctor about this.not very happy I was given this.wish I never took it.,Andrew baker
1,Clarithromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 7, 2021",0,"I was diagnosed with ureaplasma. Doc prescribed me clarythromycin 500mg once daily. First of all I was more freaked out about taking meds instead because of infection. The first day I had terrible taste and light diarrhea. Second day a taste was better but woke up with heave feeling in my chest (due to my GERD and antibiotic made it worse). Third day stomach upset, bloating, same burning in the chest but taste in mouth was better. Still 2 days left to finish. Side effects are bad but can manage but honestly i would not like take it again",Nicki
2,Clarithromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 2, 2021",1,"I was recently prescribed Clarithromycin (500 mg) once a day and the first days taking it were alright. Then after a week of treatment, started intense migraines and back pain. I also felt like fainting and was sweating a lot. Last night, I was panicked as I could not sleep (was awake until 6 am), my heart started beating out of control and followed a panic attack with chills.  I could barely breathe and was about to go to the A and E to get it checked out but I thankfully read the other reviews on this medication. Please think twice before taking this!! Moreover it didn't help my skin infection, so did more damage than repair.",Rose

4,Clarithromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 21, 2020",4,"Got prescribed clarithromycin for a cut on my hand so that it doesn’t get infected. Worst antibiotic I’ve ever taken. The dose is 500mg twice a day and every time I take it I feel sick and get the worst headache. My stomach feels so heavy like there are rocks weighing me down. The first day I took it, my heart started beating really fast and I got so paranoid I couldn’t even sleep. I have general anxiety and this just made it x10 worse. These antibiotics are also huge so would not recommend to people who can't swallow tablets. Not to mention this disgusting metallic taste in my mouth all day!! Would not recommend! Would rather my hand get infected than feeling like this.",Anonymous

The headaches and nausea I can actually handle, but this horrible metallic taste in my mouth actually wakes me up from sleep and never goes away during the day.

6,Clarithromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 2, 2020",7,I've had cellulitis 3 times as I've had it once I know I'm prone to it. Yes I get the bad taste but the tablets work. As long as the infection clears I will put up with any side effects rather than a red painful leg. All antibiotics have side effects but if you don't want to be suffering an illness then you take them,Jilly
7,Clarithromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 12, 2020",7,"This medication clarithromycin is the worst, the side effect of the metallic taste in your mouth lasts for hours and days. (Takes like hairspray or something toxic in your mouth) Comes and goes but very often. I get stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea and really bad indigestion when eating food. Makes it really difficult to finish a meal. Feeling extremely ill, run down. Had bouts of insomnia and anxiety. I’ve had to be on this medication twice in the last month and honestly I’m guttered to be on it again. It really is like taking poison the side effects are horrible but I’m trying to push through it. Good luck if you’re prescribed this, I just want to cry.",Bun
8,Clarithromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,5.0,,"August 17, 2020",2,I had a recurrence of stomach abscess a few weeks ago. Prescribed clarithromycin 500mg twice a day after first antibiotics didn’t work. Had a weeks course that certainly helped the abscess. Requested another weeks course as still felt slightly sore. Second course (different manufacturer) gave me the metallic taste and diarrhoea within a day or so. Also bloating/gas with chest pains so bad that I ended up getting an ECG to rule out heart attack. Had palpitations too. Stopped taking on day 6 as felt too rough. That was 3 days ago and still upset tummy. No diarrhoea but very gassy and some chest/back pain along with it. Feels like slowly getting better.  Because of the stomach pains it’s hard to know if my abscess has gone as it’s the same area. This has caused me a lot of anxiety. If drug actually worked and the side effects are just temporary (and not serious) then I might take again but right now I don't this antibiotic.  I might post another review in a weeks time and see how I am then.,Caveman

I had an abscess which is thankfully healing and I thank these antibiotics for that but I can’t even describe how bad the taste in my mouth has been, always peaking a couple hours after I’ve taken them and through the night.  It is disgusting and I have a sore tongue.  I can only describe it as a constant taste of poison or like I seen someone else say, like someone has sprayed a whole can of hairspray in your mouth.",Tartanlass

Started out with nausea, metallic taste, and stomach pains. Day 2 I had palpitations. The fifth pill took the side effects to another level. I went to bed with a song playing in my head that wouldn’t stop. It was hard to sleep. Eventually I slept. Then the first nightmare came. Then came intrusive and dark thoughts. I couldn’t reason myself out of it. I woke my wife up and told her that I’d gone mad and could no longer trust myself. Then more sleep, more nightmares. The next day I thought that I might have died in the night and was now in some kind of afterlife. By the evening my mental state had improved a great deal now. I have never suffered from any kind of mental illness before btw. I quit on the advice of a pharmacist.",Shattered

Although it initially started to clear it soon came back with a vengeance.  I am still taking the meds and have had 4 further flare ups where Dr has giving me metronidazole as well.  As soon as I stop taking metronidazole, even though I am still on clarithromycin, the infection flares again.

16,Clarithromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 7, 2019",7,"I was prescribed clarithromycin 500 for a skin infection. I took my first one on Monday & felt fine but had extreme hunger pains. The next morning, I ate breakfast & had another pill. Within 10 minutes I had diarrhoea & spiked a fever. I returned to my GP who believed I had a stomach virus. I requested a new antibiotic. The next 2 days I had more diarrhoea, nausea, continuing fever & my heart was racing. On Friday I went to the hospital with dehydration & fever. My blood pressure was very high & my heart rate was 150. The gastric specialist took bloods, which were normal. I stayed overnight for fluids. I was then able to provide a stool sample that proved that clarithromycin had caused all of my symptoms. I saw a dermatologist who said that my skin infection had never required antibiotics. Because of the need for GPs to overprescribe I took a drug I didn’t need that has totally messed up my digestive system. Always question a GP to see if you actually need them. They should be saved for serious infections only.",Caa

I experience some fatigue, but I'm not sure if it is from the meds not being as strong as Doxy. Some people have mentioned stomach aches etc. like the person taking it for H-Pylori. That experience is die off of bacteria which causes the stomach aches etc. called herxing. The bacteria release toxins into our body after they are killed, and that is what causes the awful feeling.
