0,Flagyl,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2020",5,"Absolutely awful reaction to this drug, Flagyl have never been so sick on any medication. Was prescribed for a puncture wound to avoid infection but honestly cannot say if it worked or not although the infection was prevented. However I was completely dysfunctional with side effects from the flagyl including shocking headache, sore throat, hallucinations, dizziness, sore back, upset stomach, sinus reaction, and extreme fatigue.",WildWood
1,Flagyl,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 21, 2015",3,"I was put on this drug, intravaneously, following emergency surgery for an anal abcess.  When I awoke in the hospital several hours after surgery, the first reaction felt like hot, fluid fire being poured down my throat...burning my mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach.  After that, I immediately began havid horrid hallucinations...saw several dark, death shadows hovering over me and flying across the ceiling and walls.  I immediately called the nurse and told her about the symtoms, and insisted that she remove all IVs (she wasn't very symphathetic).  I finally slept for a couple of hours, but when I awoke, I had an awful metallic taste in my mouth that lasted for 2 weeks after I was released.",Boomer53
