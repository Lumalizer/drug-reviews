0,Ciprofloxacin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10,,"June 13, 2019",6,"I was put on this for a Cat Bite - Bacterial Infection. Please don't let bad comments scare you. I'm allergic to penicillin & have limited options. My Dr. gave me the warnings & I was terrified. You may be dizzy for a few hours the first time you take it, but then you adjust. If you have a sensitive stomach, have crackers & ginger ale on hand, it helps.Ruptured tendons concern. I researched & found that  athletes & people over 60 (I'm 54)  are more susceptible because they are magnesium deficient & the fluoride molecules in Cipro bind with magnesium to make you even more deficient. Disclaimer: I'm not a health care professional, please research this yourself.I started taking Cipro & within 2 days my heels started hurting. I found out about magnesium & started taking supplements. The pain went away rather quickly.   Remember to take at least 2 hours after your dose or 6 hours before or it will interfere with absorption of Cipro.Bottom line, this drug worked well for me & the side effects were manageable with magnesium supplements",Sylvia
1,Ciprofloxacin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 3, 2018",5,"Cipro (ciprofloxacin):I have a petty mean case of cellulitis.  I was prescribed cipro 2x's daily.  The first day I took it, some of the redness seemed to lighten up, my body had aches all over, but I was still willing to proceed to get rid of the deep nasty pain of the infection. Can not use NSAIDS on cipro - so tylenol 4 times daily it was.  Tylenol only worked about 2 hours and the pain was back plus.  3 days in the redness was growing and an ulcer had now formed.  I kept taking it.  I called my doctor on the 6th day and was told to keep taking the cipro.  8 full days and 1 half day later I was in ER.  They scanned my leg, abscess is forming.  WBC is higher than the previous week - it is doing nothing but making more pain all over my body.  D/C Cipro and now on to Cephalexin 500MG 4 times a day.  Man I hope something works fast!",Betty Too
2,Ciprofloxacin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,4,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 6, 2017",6,"I'm giving this medicine a rating of 4 out of 10. I was prescribed this when I went to the doctor with a horrible ear infection. The right side of my face was swollen and my ear was almost swollen shut! I had already felt dizzy and nauseous because of my ear infection so when it continued I just thought it was my ear infection. My ear infection cleared up and I still had day left of the meds. As soon as I took my morning dose I got extremely nauseous and shaky. I do not recommend these to anyone. I've never had an anti-biotic make me feel this sick. I even tried taking it with food and it still didn't help. I've also been extremely bloated, and have had diarrhea since I started taking it. I know everyone is different but this is horrible.",Jaz1993

5,Ciprofloxacin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,,"January 28, 2016",6,"I had this for pelvic inflammatory disease. I immediately experienced fatigue and was extremely sick to my stomach for weeks afterward. Soon after that, I got crippling leg pain and migraine headaches on a regular basis. The head aches continued to get worse til they were every day. I also have pain in the tendons around my eyes and pretty bad stomach issues from this medication. I've been on a downward spiral that keeps getting worse because of the mitochondrial damage I've endured. I hope to recover, but it's been 7 yrs since taking it and haven't been the same since, just keeps getting worse!!!",nofx25
6,Ciprofloxacin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 6, 2015",10,"Had feeling in my lower abdomen and scrotal/testicle area like I'd took a blow but I hadn't. Went to docs after a few days as pain wasn't getting any better. She prescribed trimethoprim for a UTI. Took it for four days and the pain didn't get better. Over the weekend pain and sensitivity around penis, scrotum, testicles, perineal area and my back got significantly worse. Went to docs on the Monday. He said it's epididymitis. Prescribed me Ciprofloxacin to take 2 a day for one week. I  saw dramatic improvement with first 1 or 2 tablets. I was able to sit down and was no longer in constant pain and I could enjoy life again. I still have some sensitivity but I imagine the swelling will go give another week. This drug works quickly and very well.",MJ Brown
