0,Clindamycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 24, 2022",0,"I've been on Clindamycin, multiple times 450mg every 8 hours for 7 days. 300mg every 8 hours for 7 days. 300mg every 12 hours for 10 days. Knocks out MRSA cellulitis/folliculitis like no other. A combo of Keflex and Doxy for 20 days did nothing except land me in the ER with MRSA sepsis, where IV Clindamycin took care of it in 24 hours. I now ask for it by name. It's going to work, trust me. Side effects for me personally are body/joint aches, tiredness and a bit of brain fog. Extreme nausea and reflux occurred the first time I took it, until I learned to only drink water while taking it. Cut out everything else you drink, especially carbonated drinks, and stick to water.",Sel
1,Clindamycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10.0,,"February 2, 2022",0,"I have taken Clindamycin close to 8 times now for infected teeth, gum abscesses & full blown MRSA & it has been the only antibiotic that has done the job. I’d also like to mention for any of those reading this, I suffer from severe emetophobia. I’ve been on the highest dose as well as the lowest & as long as I drink TONS of water, DO NOT lie down for a solid 30-45 mins, take a probiotic & keep eating small meals I have minimal side effects with this antibiotic. That’s not to say I don’t experience the occasional stomach discomfort, weird taste in my mouth, brain fog, dizziness but it also depends on what I’m being treated for & how bad that infection is to begin with. A dose of this & a shot of Toradol in the ER knocked my 10/10 tooth/jaw pain down to a 2/10 within 10 minutes as I refuse any narcotics. This medication may not be everyone’s cup of tea but if you have a severe infection that is at risk of spreading I highly recommended giving it a shot.",Anonymous

3,Clindamycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 22, 2021",0,"I have had to take this for a dental abscess several times since I cannot take amoxicillin.Most recently my dentist gave me a loading dose of 600 mg and then 300 mg 3x a day. Each time I have not been able to tolerate and it was switched to 150 mg 3x a day.On the plus side, it definitely worked for my infection each time.I didn't realize until looking back at my emails that this medication has consistently made me race mentally and have very bad insomnia. I actually have become what I would call manic, but not manic in a ""fun"" way but racing in a bad way. And I do not have mania as a diagnosis. I do have anxiety, however. But this feels different from having anxiety.The other side effect I get from it is a very tight chest after taking it, which may be related to the reflux other people experience with it.In my experience, there aren't any great antibiotics without side effects, which is why I will give this a middle of the road score.",swingerofbirches
4,Clindamycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 23, 2021",0,I had a finger infection so was prescribed 300mg 3x/day for 5 days. I took it with a cup of water & ate a yogurt probably about 3-4 of those days.  Doctor told me to eat yogurt everyday. Everything went well. My finger started to heal & skin peeled about 2 weeks after finishing the medication. About a week after I finished the pills I started having soft stools everyday. Now I’m 3 weeks post & it’s more of a diarrhea consistency with a headache. I’m drinking more water & will start yogurt again to see if it helps. Will update.,Can

I didn't respond to whatever had been prescribed earlier and my toe was showing early signs of necrosis.  Each time I take one of the ""easy"" antibiotics that is not hard on you I feel bad, generalized fatigue and lethargy seems to take over.  I had no problems what so ever and felt great on Clindamycin.  I did not drink water, take probiotics or eat yogurt.  It cleared up the infection fast and I felt fine.",Aggiegirl

Clindamycin jumped in and went to work fast, I felt better all over quite soon. I think I may have still had some residual infection that this wiped out.

9,Clindamycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2020",4,I was scared to use this clindamycin medication because I had read that many negative things about this one. I decided to just start taking it 20 days after being prescribed. I started taking probiotic capsules on same day I started this medication. I also ate a yogurt every time I took it. I made sure that I always had food in my stomach and drank a full glass of water. It did help me heal.No side effects.,Anonymous

11,Clindamycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10.0,,"September 6, 2020",23,"I saw all the horrible reviews. But I had no choice. I'd already been on amoxicillin for 7 days for a dental abscess and had to try clindamycin.  Let me say I have EXTREME anxiety and HATE taking anything. So I was nervous. Anyway I had read some people said drink LOTS of water with it and take a probiotic, so I did. I drank 30oz with every dose (3 times a day) and took a probiotic halfway between doses 2 and 3. I also sipped water throughout the day (no juice, coffee, soda etc. I had almost ZERO side effects. I did notice for about an hour after each dose, I felt a little dizzy/out of it. Nothing major (could have just been my anxiety too). I also did use the bathroom more often, but honestly with my level of anxiety I was not surprised. That was it. And it cleared up my infection totally! I will continue the probiotics and lots of water at least for a month to be sure. But this stuff works. Don't let the reviews scare you. I think lots of water is key.",Katie

This clindamycin has caused me off the charts mania/anxiety/panic that left me with suicidal ideation. The stomach cramps and heart palpitations is also something I could do without. Miserable, bed bound, and hoping for it all to finally end. There is ZERO reason why this junk should be on the market. It literally destroys your digestive system.

19,Clindamycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 6, 2020",6,I was prescribed clindamycin for middle ear infection. I was terrified of the reviews but was able to finish the bottle.  I took the 300mg 4x a day for 10 days.  The first 3 pills were fine but by the 4th one I felt so sick.   Since there is limited space I’ll just give my advice on how to get better.  After the 6th day of taking this I didn’t have any aide effects.  To avoid heartburn you HAVE to drink a lot of water when taking this pill.  I drank 24oz each time. DO NOT lie down right after taking it. I usually stood up for 30 min after and I also slept straight up on my couch. I also ate something either right before or 15 min before taking this.  I got a slight heartburn once but nothing else. To lower the risks of c diff diarrhea you definitely need probiotics in your life. I did have diarrhea and slight stomach pains for the first 4 days but it was regular for the rest of the time.  I ate probiotic yogurt 2 hours after each pill and found a probiotic pill. Be sure to take probiotics at least 2 hours after your antibiotic.,Jay

Twenty minutes after taking the first pill, i had a painful knot in my throat/chest that made me burp and it felt like I could puke any minute. I thought maybe it was stuck in my throat. I took my 2nd dose about 7 hours later and same thing. I called my oral surgeon yesterday morning and told him of this side effect. He told me to eat yogurt before taking it and that should help. He was right. I just eat half a cup of yogurt and then take this pill and the knot in my throat is gone. I hope this helps others who are having the same issue.",Ceceily

I could barely get out of bed for 48 hours. Then the body aches subsided quite a bit. I kept having chronic headaches,  nausea,  diarrhea still going on since day one.

Family physician who sent me to emergency fearing deep space infection. Incredibly grateful to him for his care integrity of human life.I get to emergency and I'm put on IV clindamycin the doctor tells me how great the drug is and says nothing about the side effects. I return the next day to the hospital for a second round of clindamycin doctors still not considered my bowel condition and when I say I'm itchy and burning I'm ignored. Then given a prescription to fill of the drug and begin taking orally at home. Three days later I go back to emergency. Days later loose stools continues to get worse Clear jelly like matter and mucus alternating are coming out. I return to emergency  nine days later I'm told I have flu. I tell the doctors about the drug...they ignore me. Send me home. It's nineteen days now and I feel like my bowel is going to explode. Going back to emergency,Scared to death

I was hoping for a quick fix to clear up my stubborn acne and I didn't think this was helping. If you are struggling to get rid of those stubborn whiteheads, closed comedones and blackheads, here is what I did and I noticed a difference in my skin the next day: First I used micellar water to remove any dirt or makeup, then I boiled some water and steamed my face for about five mins (which I never do). Once I did that, I cleansed with cereve cleansing wash with salycylic acid and dried my skin with a clean towel  and then I applied the clindamycin. I was so surprised to see the difference the next day! I had clear skin on my forehead and underneath my eye area and my cheeks looked clearer. Everyone's skin is different but I struggled the worst with congested pores. I would suggest giving it a try. I will continue this regimen . Hope this helps!",Tashie

29,Clindamycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,8.0,,"September 15, 2019",10,"I made sure to check with the Dr & the pharmacist on the correct way to take the medication because I know many antibiotics can upset your stomach if taken on an empty stomach. I was told to eat something before taking it & to expect diarrhea. Before I took it, I also read the little pamphlet that came with the medication from my pharmacy. The directions said to take with a little bit of food & to drink a full 8 oz. water w/the pill AND to not lay down for 10 min after. I followed those rules & did not have diarrhea or any other side effects. The only side effect that I did have is a ridiculously awful taste in my mouth. I wouldn't even call it metallic but it tastes like the worst morning breath x10. Even brushing and rinsing with mouthwash hasn't gotten rid of it. My last dose was over 24 hours ago and I still have the taste in my mouth. Hoping it will go away soon. Otherwise, I have no issues with this antibiotic.

It took more than 8 months to fully recover and I was living  with severe heartburn, weakness, nausea, and inability to eat or drink without severe pain.

I was taking it three times a day. Each time I'd take it I'd drink a bottle of water and eat a piece of toast.They recommend not to lay down for 10 minutes after taking it-- wait longer. I attempted to lay down after 20 minutes and had the worst burning in my esophagus ever and that's coming from someone with GERD who is no newbie when it comes to heartburn.I waited 45 minutes to an hour after that and had no issues until the last day.

34,Clindamycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 15, 2019",5,Fabulous experience with clindamycin. Had a bad cut in my finger which spread badly and looked like it was going septic - began to look like a sausage. My local Urgent Care prescribed Keflex which did nothing and I wound up going to another ER after a week of the useless Keflex. PMC gave me a 20 minute IV of this and I continued with the capsules afterward. By the fifth day it was just about back to normal. Absolutely unbelievable how quickly it worked. I'd had a bad experience before but was taking Synthroid and Depakote at the time - I attribute that one instance to drug interaction. It seems even vitamins and Ibuprofen and aspirin interact.,Massulis
