6,Cefdinir,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 22, 2017",4,"I had to take this for some infected blisters on my foot. (Foot was swollen, purple, and oozing liquids by the way, fun) It worked with no bad aftertaste or side effects. Took about a week. Odd that I'm seeing everyone getting all this diarrhea from it, I didn't have a single issue and I get diarrhea from everything. Worked differently for me I guess.",Kosistyy
7,Cefdinir,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 8, 2016",8,"HORRIBLE.  Was prescribed 300mg x1 daily.  Day one was sharp pains in lower intestines. Day 2 was worse, with acid reflux that was the worst I ever had. I tried Apple Cider Vinegar, Pepto, Oatmeal, Omeprazole. Almost went to ER. Finally started to subside after 6 hours. I stopped it and still had pains in lower intestines for next few days.  And a Panic attack 2nd day off. WORST STUFF EVER!!!IT must be bad. Even one of the manufacturer's discontinued it. SO many bad reviews too.  For what I was being treated for I was actually suppose to be on 300mg x. 2 I am so glad that PA was a dope and got it wrong.  A NEW PA diagnosed me differently and put me on Cipro. FDA Should make Companies refund us/system for crap like this.",Anonymous
