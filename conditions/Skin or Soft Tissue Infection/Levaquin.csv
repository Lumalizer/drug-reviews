2,Levaquin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 22, 2017",6,Was given Levaquin for lingering lung bronchial condition. After 7 days. I was feeling 10x worse.  At first I thought I had the flu.  Headache fever achy all over no energy just weak. Then my shoulder joints started hurting so bad I could cry.  On a pain score 1-10 I was at a 15 and I've had 4 kids and rods in my back.  I contacted the Dr who told me to stop taking this Medication. That iris known for pain in joints.  Well I'm 2 weeks out. Still in pain all the way down both arms.  Sleeping on a heating pad and taking pain medication. My original complaint seems minor compared to this.  Dr says 4-6 weeks to get it out of your system.  I am Miserable. Can't lift my arms.  ,Tina P.

It took the pain & swelling completely away and I didn't experience no side effects. I've had this flare up 2 more times & this is the only medication that has helped me. It is very exspensive, but other than that I'm very pleased.",Rizz
6,Levaquin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1.0,,"September 24, 2010",12,"Prescribed this medicine for a skin infection.  Side effects that I experienced were: confusion, sensitivity to sun, could feel some old muscle/tendon injuries stiffening, depression and even had some thoughts of suicide.  These side effects were very real and tied directly to taking the medicine.  I could feel the confusion and depression lift, literally within 2 minutes, when the side effect wore off.  The depression would dissipate about 8 hours after taking the 500mg pill. ",Anonymous
