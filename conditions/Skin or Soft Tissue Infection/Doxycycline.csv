0,Doxycycline,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 1, 2022",3,"Had Folliculitis Decalvans (Scalp Folliculitis), more MANY years. Tried everything from medicated creams, antibiotics, steroid shots, healthy diets, vitamins, medicated shampoo and more.. nothing worked!I experimented on a sub-microbial dose of doxycycline, which is already marketed as ORACEA, but I couldn't afford it so I took generic doxycycline at 20mg twice a day, which is the same thing. It's too low to work as an antibiotic and doesn't lead to resistance or changes in gut flora, but still provides a high anti-inflammatory effect as this antibiotic does. It is safe for long term, use it forever. In 1 WEEK, I noticed drastic change in scalp pustules, weeping, and redness. This is amazing.",Mohammad
1,Doxycycline,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 30, 2021",0,"My Dr prescribed doxycycline 100mg for 20 days twice a day for self diagnosed peri oral dermatitis. My Dr says it’s rosacea, but either way the doxycycline worked well. I tried EVERY cream, salve and lotion on the market  and it did nothing. It does cause me horrible stomach upset unless I eat at the moment I swallow the pill. Usually 2-3 pieces of toast does the trick. The treatment works within just 3 or so days but I continue the course as directed. It does come back tho. This time I made it 8 months between treatments and the break out lessens each time. I hope one day it will work for good. It flares up especially in the winter and with daily mask usage at work. Doxycycline is the only treatment that has worked so far even tho the result is somewhat temporary. I’ll take it regardless just to clear up my face!",Rayg741

My eyes get extremely red and painful, and sensitive to light. The pain is so bad at night it wakes me up. My eye doctor has been prescribing this, and it works. I take it for 90 days in the 50mg dose. It makes my arthritis/joint pain much more bearable too. It seems to have an anti-inflammatory action of some kind, and it even helps with my chronic sinus problems. It makes my whole body feel better.",Delise

I took it again July 2021 and noticed I had a headache. I did not attribute it to the doxycycline, so I can continue to take it. Now, October 2021, I am taking it again for a surgical wound infection. Within 3 days I have the worst headache I've ever had in my life. Severe sinus pressure and eye pressure. I have double vision and my right eye doesn't follow my left eye. I've been on doxycycline for 4 days, and now I'm done. This medication is horrible. Being on this medication three separate times in the last 8 months has done something horrible to my eyesight. Please be cautious, and aware, when taking this medication.",Barbara
4,Doxycycline,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 24, 2021",1,"Took doxy for 8 months after round of IV antibiotics for 8 weeks after a bad prosthetic joint infection. I didn’t really have much problem with it that time except for bad sun sensitivity would burn quickly. After the 8 months my infectious disease (ID) doctor said it was clear to stop it. Well 10 days after stopping it I was in ER with sepsis in hip. Long story short after being in hospital for a while and another 6 weeks of IV antibiotics I was put back on doxycycline again this time will be on it or equivalent for life . But this round of it has made me very nauseous, bloated, and vomit easily. Tried everything can think of doing for the sickness . Dramamine helps though .  Still for me I can’t stop it for now, hopefully can get ID doctor to prescribe something easier on me if there is. But it’s better than the alternative",Anonymous

6,Doxycycline,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 18, 2021",0,"Took a 7 day course for an infection I got on the outside of my nose after having a nose vein removal by laser (tech didn't do it right, resulting in 4 ulcers--never go to anyone but an M.D. ! Lesson learned). I was very hesitant to take this due to all the risks and reviews, but I'm so glad I did. My nose has almost completely cleared in the 7 days of dosing. Only side effect I had was headache. I took it religiously with 2 pieces of toast or a PB&J, and never laid down for an hour after taking. No stomach issues at all. I'm super grateful for this drug and very happy I stuck with it! The only reason I rated it an 8 is because of the headaches, which were more of a nuisance than anything. But also because I had to avoid calcium (per the insert), and this meant skipping vitamins because I'd forget to take them middle of the day. But I guess this is my problem, not doxy :)",NoVa4
7,Doxycycline,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 9, 2021",0,"I’ve been on 100mg of Doxycycline a day for almost 30 days now, it’s for perioral dermatitis which was not going away. I take it right after dinner every night, drink lots of water before bed, and also eat yogurt with added probiotics every morning. I’m constantly nauseous and almost always have a mild headache unfortunately, but PD is such a nightmare I will continue taking Doxycycline until I’m out. I almost forgot to take a pill one night, so I had it right before bed and what a big mistake! I had heartburn for 24 hrs afterwards and was more nauseous and had a worse headache. So be careful! I can’t imagine taking this on an empty stomach. My skin currently looks amazing, so hopefully my PD stays away after this, I sure don’t want to feel this awful for a month again.",Canadian

Having read all the reviews I was dreading taking it. However despite everything I read I did proceed with the initial weeks course. Apart from suppressing my appetite, not such a bad thing, I feel fine on this medication. My infection started to feel so much better 48 hours in and although I had to take a second course to completely clear it up I would recommend this medication. I honestly feel it’s like most drugs, some people are more sensitive than others. I often struggle to find medication that agrees with me, but do not be put off by all the negative reviews.",Poz

I have no energy and no appetite. Despite eating less, I have gained 12 pounds in 4 weeks. Now I know that people often want to blame medication for weight gain when it's likely not the culprit...but I have weighed the same for about 12 years, give or take 1-2 lbs. This is crazy. I feel like I'm wearing a fat suit at all times and it's very uncomfortable. To the point where I don't know how to manage the next four weeks.

I also was very careful to remain upright (didn't lean back or lay down) for at least 2 hours after ingesting. The doctor recommended that if I experienced nausea that I should take a pill called Gravol one hour before. Luckily I didn't need it.For reference, Amoxicillin slightly messed up my lower stomach after about the 3rd or 4th day (probiotics did help) and Azithromycin gave me slight nausea about 45 minutes after ingesting so it's not like  I have a stomach of steel or anything.
