0,Azithromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 21, 2022",0,I was given a 3 day dose of 500mg. No side effects until the 3rd day when my heart rate went up to 146bpm. I’m on a couple BP meds and got pretty freaked out. I contacted the cardiologist in call who basically said it’s doesn’t cause heart issues. This is incorrect according to everything I have read. I took my beta blocker and my heart rate came down. I’m thankful that I’m done with this medication. I’m not sure how effective it was since I’m also on a Medrol dose  pak. I’ll be real happy when both of these meds are out of my system.  Azithromycin has a 68 hr half life.,mychel53

2,Azithromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 29, 2021",5,"I was prescribed Lupin Azithromycin (Z pack) on 1/13/21.  You take it for five days and its effects last 6-10 days. I read that the half-life of the drug after you take the last dose is another 15.5 days, so it stays in your system a while.  By day 7,  I had serious fatigue and confusion. I also started having palpitations, brain fog, dizziness and anxiety .  All I can do now is wait until this tainted drug gets out of my system and hope it hasn't caused permanent damage.  My optician wrote the prescription for a stye on my eye.  I wish I hadn't compromised my otherwise excellent health for something so minor by by taking this awful drug.",Blue
3,Azithromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,,"July 15, 2017",2,"Zithromax (azithromycin):I took 1 pill and about 6 hours later, I was getting out of my car and woke up on the sidewalk. I had passed out with no warning signs or symptoms. I passed out again within 2 minutes of the first time. I went to the local Urgent Care and after speaking to the doctor, he believes it was a side effect of the zpak. That is the only change in any food, drink or medication for weeks. I was not overheated and I was hydrated prior to passing out.",Nfields
4,Azithromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10,,"October 2, 2016",7,Zithromax (azithromycin):So got my wisdom teeth out about three days ago had an infection got perscribed some other crazy antibiotic wasn't comfortable taking it so I asked for a new one the next day and got perscribed zpack was hesitating to take this one also because of the reviews and warnings it has im also not one for taking antibiotics. Don't listen to the reviews your reading they're scary I have terrible anxiety but it's rare that people have those side effects So yesterday I finally took it. only had slight nausea and abdominal pains I think the nausea was from the nervousness I also got an awesome sleep I'm already feeling better after my 2nd dose have 3 days to go. But I think it's doing it's job just eat yogurt and take a probiotic you will be fine,Mo1995
5,Azithromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 11, 2016",1,I have taken a zpack for years now when I have infections due to having severe allergies to other medication families. I am faced with yet another soft tissue tooth infection and will of course be asking for my usual zpack to make it go down until we can get heart clearance from my doctors to have the teeth that are infected removed.,Mom37013
