0,Penicillin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2021",0,"Worked to some extent, but the first couple days of taking it, I felt really nauseous, ended up with a fever, and was throwing up. I've stopped taking it since then. I will forever blame penicillin for making my worry about being nauseous and throwing up worse.",bowe569
1,Penicillin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 21, 2021",0,"Penicillin VK (penicillin v potassium):I took this medication for a nerve infection, and ate food while I was taking it, but within a couple of days, I started feeling nauseous, had a fever, and was throwing up. Ever since then, I've stopped taking it. Will NEVER take this medication again due to it causing me to be more anxious and more worried about being nauseous and throwing up.",bowe768

3,Penicillin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,6,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 25, 2018",3,"Had a surgery recently and was sent home with this medication to take for post op.  Prescription was 4 pills a day... Had a weeks supply.  Day 2 I'm severely light headed, feeling like I'm going to faint any time I move.  I was off and on nauseous.  My body felt extremely weak.  I typically had chills and cold sweats about an hour after taking the pill every time I took it.  I also experienced minor difficulty breathing, as if my breathing was suddenly off rhythm and shallow.  I stopped taking the medication on day 3 and fully recovered. Not the pill for me.",Major Sighd Effex
