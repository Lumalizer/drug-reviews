1,Cephalexin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 13, 2021",2,I had a 500 mg dose/every 6 hours. I got something called a brain zap! It was terrifying. Days 4-10 every time I tried to fall asleep it felt like an electric current ran through my head a startled me awake. I’ve never felt that in my life. It got so bad I stayed up for 2 days straight. I woke up panicking every time. It was terrible. I usually have anxiety once or twice a week but this medication amplified my anxiety x10. I got at least 3 anxiety attacks a days like 30 min or more at a time. Other than that I had trouble breathing and slight body aches but the worst of it was the brain zaps and anxiety. My infection was completely gone in 2 days and clean almost pain free. Effective in that way absolutely BUT was not worth the side effects at all. If you have an option to take a different antibiotic I would recommend you do that!,Anonymous

I have only taken antibiotics once in my life when I was in high school. I am 28 now just to give you some perspective. I had a cosmetic procedure and my surgeon prescribed Keflex. The first day I was still coming off anesthesia so I didn’t feel much.But, the next day I felt horrible. I was so delirious, dizzy, confused. That was just the start! As the days went on I experienced blurred vision, sadness, extreme fatigue and then insomnia. One night I slept for only one hour. I have suffered some acute memory issues and brain fog.I have to say that this experience has left me very afraid of antibiotics and I only kept taking it because I had to in order to avoid possible infection. I will never willing take Keflex or any other antibiotic. But, I did not get an infection so I guess it did its job.",Violet

It didn’t really help the second time (after I got my cyst removed and stitches in) but that’s my fault, I was prescribed doxycycline and I took cephalexin AGAIN instead.

It's hard to say whether the improvement or my side effects were from Keflex or Bactrim, so take this with a grain of salt. I had tachycardia, chills, nausea, indigestion, gas pain that felt like chest pain, itching on arms/legs, petechiae on my upper arms, frequent urination, and eventual yeast infection for which I had to take diflucan. I had some symptoms together, and some separate. Most of my side effects came at night though, so it could've been some kind of reaction between the two?The side effects definitely hit me harder in the beginning, but by my 5th day of Keflex, almost all side effects had subsided.

No bad reaction as I usually get very nauseous from other antibiotics but not Keflex. I made sure to take the dose on time every day and had a small meal 10 minutes before each dose. 2 hours after each dose I took a double dose of probiotics and was also taking saccharomyces boulardii (another probiotic but it is a yeast and is not killed by antibiotic since it is not a bacteria). Did NOT experience any stomach pains, diarrhea, anxiety,l ight headiness like others.

Pleasant experience overall- no side effects besides headaches the first 2 days but minor; pain relievers not needed. However, I didn't consume alcohol or caffeine for the entirety of the treatment as I was advised that Cephalexin enhances side effects caused by alcohol and coffee such as drowsiness, dizziness, upset stomach, ect. I had a Chai drink containing a very little amount of caffeine- I got dizzy and very anxious within the hour of drinking it; never happened to me before despite countless times having the drink so I related it to the drug, further exemplifying how much the medication enhances both physiological and neurological effects of substances such as caffeine.

They would show up randomly so the dr. was never able to take a culture since they would come to a head and then pop whenever. He put me on a 20 day regimen of Keflex (500) and another ointment antibiotic that he told me to dab into my nose. He said for some odd reason, boils seem to start in the nose. I followed the instructions and had a minor recurrence several months later. I went immediately to see him so he put me back on Keflex. These boils were clustered and leaving scars in the area. They haven't recurred and the scars are gone. Since I caught them starting the 2nd time, they never had a chance to come to a head because I stayed on top of it. I highly recommend it for a skin bacterial infection.",All gone
