0,Vancomycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 15, 2018",7,"Was given vancomycin via pic intervenous line for severe toe infection going deep and not healing. With first infusion, felt woozy and weird. Several hours later, got 2nd. Infusion, and felt worse. Told nurse to remove needle. These infusions took 5 hours each! Prepared to undress for bed and saw skin on upper chest and stomach bright red. This was a severe allergy reaction . My skin started peeling off next day and continued doing that for a week. Traumatized badly.",Mom
