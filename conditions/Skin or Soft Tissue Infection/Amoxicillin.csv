1,Amoxicillin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 29, 2019",3,"I have pain below a root canal that was done about 3 years ago. Then it started to swell. I went to a dentist and was told it is infected. They gave me 24 of the  500mg Amoxicillin to take 1 every 8 hours. I didn't feel any immediate relief. After about four days, the swelling seemed to finally go down. By the time I finished the prescription the swelling was gone except for a small bump and I had no pain. A couple days later, the pain crept up on me and now it's swelling again. I am trying to get either another prescription or a different antibiotic...",JB576
2,Amoxicillin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 25, 2018",1,My dentist gave me 875mg twice a day for 7 days after gum flap surgery so I don’t get a infection. I used same medication 6 months ago for the same thing when the first half of my mouth was done but I don’t remember any of these side effects. Today I slept 11 hours got up ate went back to sleep for another 3 hours. I did have stomach pains first day but just eat something small with the pills I usually eat a banana it helps a lot. I have noticed while taking this pill I have been starving!! And I’m getting bad headaches. I’m only on day 3 now so I hope things get better but I’m happy as long as I don’t get a infection.,Stephanie
3,Amoxicillin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,2,,"April 13, 2017",5,This was for prophylactic dose to protect hip replacements .The one and only time I did take only one dose I had severe stomach cramps multiple bouts of diarrhea about 12 hours after taking the med. I had also tried Clindamycin but after taking it for many years each time I needed dental work I ended up getting a rash over my neck and chest.  The next time I had a dental appt. my doc prescribed Cipro from which I had no side effects after one dose. Around that time friends began posting a lot of negative side effects from Cipro on Facebook. I demanded a change and was given Amoxicillin. The first dose caused diarrhea but with the second one came severe cramp and diarrhea two days post ingestion. Several days later I experienced respiratory problems. Wish I knew if it was the Amoxicillin.,Lilikoi
