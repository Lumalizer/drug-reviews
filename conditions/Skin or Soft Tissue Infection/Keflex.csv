2,Keflex,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 27, 2021",2,"I have a slight eye tissue infection. Optometrist suggested Keflex 2 a day 10 days. Let it be known I have experience taking a large amount of pharma’s over my lifetime. 3 hours into the first pill my back completely seized up and tightened. All my lumbar muscles to a came to an aching halt. Something I have never felt before in my life. I have competed in highly competitive sports my whole life and know my body well from years of training, and never in my life have felt weird muscle discomfort as I did taking this. Almost 24 hours after taking 1 pill I still feel the pain. It all depends on the person after reading other people not feeling any sort of discomfort from taking this stuff. I will not be taking this again.",ExperienceRecommended
3,Keflex,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2021",3,"I was taking Bactrim for 2 days with no improvement before being prescribed Keflex QID for 7 days to take with Bactrim for an infected cut on my wrist from punching glass.As soon as I began Keflex, I started noticing improvement. It's hard to say whether the improvement or my side effects were from Keflex or Bactrim, so take this with a grain of salt. I had tachycardia, chills, nausea, indigestion, gas pain that felt like chest pain, itching on arms/legs, petechiae on my upper arms, frequent urination, and eventual yeast infection for which I had to take diflucan. I had some symptoms together, and some separate. Most of my side effects came at night though, so it could've been some kind of reaction between the two?The side effects definitely hit me harder in the beginning, but by my 5th day of Keflex, almost all side effects had subsided. I suggest taking with probiotics that can survive stomach acid and easily digestible food and drink a lot of water.",owie

14,Keflex,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 25, 2014",139,"I had recurring boils in one area. They would show up randomly so the dr. was never able to take a culture since they would come to a head and then pop whenever. He put me on a 20 day regimen of Keflex (500) and another ointment antibiotic that he told me to dab into my nose. He said for some odd reason, boils seem to start in the nose. I followed the instructions and had a minor recurrence several months later. I went immediately to see him so he put me back on Keflex. These boils were clustered and leaving scars in the area. They haven't recurred and the scars are gone. Since I caught them starting the 2nd time, they never had a chance to come to a head because I stayed on top of it. I highly recommend it for a skin bacterial infection.",All gone
