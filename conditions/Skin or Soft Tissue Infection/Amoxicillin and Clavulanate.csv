To be honest this is the second pill I've taken ,1 with food and 1 without and it works so far but it doesn’t last. The first pill made the swelling go down but then it came back so we’ll see what happens later on. This abscess is huge and no sign of pus so it couldn’t be drained yet.

It felt like so much of the pain had finally left my eye. By day 4, other than the scar/scab, my eye looks and feels like normal.

Starting having diarrhea the day I started and by day five I became so sick I thought I was going to have to go to the ER. Horrible stomach pain and cramps, fever, extreme weakness, painful muscles mainly in legs, nasty sweat, nightmares, and I lost my sense of smell...which may have been a good thing since I was pretty much stuck in the bathroom. The fever and pain lasted two days after I stopped taking the augmentin on day five. The diarrhea has continued (on day eight after discontinuing drug) and is pretty much spontaneous. I can’t go anywhere. I have never had stomach issues in my life (I’m 50). I fear my gut is damaged beyond repair. This is a nasty, nasty drug.

My lower eyelid was so swollen that it was projected so far out that when I closed my eye, my inside tissue, the mucous membrane was completely exposed. It felt like my skin was ripping apart. I was prescribed 1000mg Augmentin and after the first tablet, I was about 25% better. After the second tablet, all pain was gone and it went down to looking like a normal stye again.

I'm experiencing more itching swelling. Incomplete bowel movements and urination. Tired and now I'm noticing headaches. The thing is I had a bad cough for a very long time which is practically gone.
