0,Erythromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 8, 2021",0,Worked but ended up with severe bloating and tummy problems now. And the real problem was the cost was $80 the first time second within a month it went up to $160.00 shame on the company and shame on the government for allowing this those cost with insurance. Needless to say never got it the second time had to switch to a less effective type.,Dorothy
1,Erythromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 6, 2020",0,"This was used for my Gastroparesis which is a condition that slows down digestion paralyzing the stomach. This stuff really helped me digest food better, I was able to eat almost normal when on this medication. Unfortunately I can only be on it for a short period of time because it loses its effect if taken too long.  I also had some side effects, if I got to warm or was outside in the sun I would break out in tiny bumps all across my stomach. I was on the liquid medication.  I was on and off this medication for a few months due to Pneumonia and Pneumoperitoneum and Gastroparesis. I am young adult in her early 20s.",SassySalior
2,Erythromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,2.0,,"August 30, 2020",4,"Used to take these erythromycin for year when I was 15 for acne and had no side effects. Now is a different story. Got an ingrown hair that had got infected. For four days I have had being sick, explosive diarrhea and agonizing stomach cramps coupled with no appetite. I had to take x 2 250mg tablets 4 times a day. I have been in bed for days as I'm wiped out. Phoned a walk in centre and they told me to stop taking them immediately. Never again.",B
3,Erythromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 15, 2020",2,"I was prescribed erythormycin after doxycycline doing absolutely nothing for my acne, I have been on this coming up to 2 months and haven’t seen any improvement yet. I have been on 5 courses of antibiotics and at least 8 creams and nothing works but my GP won’t refer me.  So I'll sticking with this for another month but doubt it’s going to suddenly work when stronger ones didn't.  So far my back is a lot worse and chest. If doxy didn’t work for you then don’t bother with this as it’s 3 times weaker.  My GP is clearly smart, strong treatment doesn’t work so gives me a weaker one just so I'll come back - about ready for going private.",Nickname

5,Erythromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 13, 2020",2,"Was given this erythromycin for acne because 3 previous antibiotics didn’t work so my GP has chucked me on this and have been on it around 2 weeks so far and my skin just got worse, love how all these antibiotics I’ve been given are for STIs, no wonder all the people in the chemist stare at me, but yeah I’ll update this it possible but so far 0 side effects and acne got a little better but now it’s worsened like normal with antibiotics but we’ll see in another month or so. Talk about antibiotic abuse, I hope  they work when I actually need them because I’ll be antibiotic resistant..if this doesn’t work I’m just going on accutane.",Nickname
6,Erythromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 1, 2020",12,"Not sure why acne isn't listed but yeah, my GP recently gave me erythromycin  as doxy just made my skin worse and Lymecycline did nothing. I'm on 4 pills a day at 250mg and after 2 days my redness has basically gone and seeing improvement.  The only bad thing is (cant say for sure its this drug) but I currently have a cold and hurts when I swallow anything. Never had a cold believe it or not in years and I feel dizzy at times and lack of energy also but to me its worth putting up with seeing as I have had mild acne for 7 years and wasted hundreds of pounds on useless treatments.  As for clearing so far I have seen noticeable differences on my face.  The spots are almost gone even and ones on my chest and back are fading.I will update you later on as everyone knows how antibiotics work..normally stop working half way through or acne comes back.",Nick
7,Erythromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 21, 2019",13,"I've taken Erythromycin (for acne) for close to 70-80 days now, and I have to say I have had no side effects, and my skin hasn't had more than one spot in 4 months ( I can't see Erythromycin listed for Acne here but it works!) , or maybe it helps that I also got myself out of a stressful work environment too, but but the Erythromycin definitely works.",Anonymous
8,Erythromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 11, 2016",9,Had a insect bite that got really badly infected on my calf to the point where I could barely walk it was that painful I was on penicillin but that did very little but after taking this it cleared up almost immediately. Although it's making feel quite nauseas where  all it takes is a buiscuit to make me want to throw up also having headaches and my heart beat keeps going fast but it worked a treat on my bite,Kitkat0897
9,Erythromycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,5.0,,"October 1, 2009",41,This drug worked miracles for my skin but the side effects are overwhelming. I constantly have an upset stomach and am always tired. I have to take this medicine right before bed so I can function throughout my day. Usually when I wake up I still fell some of the side effects like an upset stomach.,Anonymous
