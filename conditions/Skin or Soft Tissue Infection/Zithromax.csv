0,Zithromax,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,,"July 15, 2017",2,"I took 1 pill and about 6 hours later, I was getting out of my car and woke up on the sidewalk. I had passed out with no warning signs or symptoms. I passed out again within 2 minutes of the first time. I went to the local Urgent Care and after speaking to the doctor, he believes it was a side effect of the zpak. That is the only change in any food, drink or medication for weeks. I was not overheated and I was hydrated prior to passing out.",Nfields
1,Zithromax,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10,,"October 2, 2016",7,So got my wisdom teeth out about three days ago had an infection got perscribed some other crazy antibiotic wasn't comfortable taking it so I asked for a new one the next day and got perscribed zpack was hesitating to take this one also because of the reviews and warnings it has im also not one for taking antibiotics. Don't listen to the reviews your reading they're scary I have terrible anxiety but it's rare that people have those side effects So yesterday I finally took it. only had slight nausea and abdominal pains I think the nausea was from the nervousness I also got an awesome sleep I'm already feeling better after my 2nd dose have 3 days to go. But I think it's doing it's job just eat yogurt and take a probiotic you will be fine,Mo1995
