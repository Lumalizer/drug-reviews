0,Biaxin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 13, 2019",9,"I have had a terrible reaction to this drug which has resulted in 2 hospital stays and lingering side effects. I took the tablets as prescribed for 5 days. First 2 days no side effects.  Day 3-4 chills and the start of a rash. Day 5 rushed to ER due to rashes all over and swelling of the eyes.  These symptoms have now gone away but deep tissue itchiness continues.   These symptoms sent us back to the ER where I was admitted and monitored for 5 days and released.  Post hospital experience now 12 days later include extreme fatigue, rapid dropping of blood pressure making it difficult to stand and walk, back pain, no stamina or strength.  Seeing a blood specialist next week for further diagnosis.",GCM
