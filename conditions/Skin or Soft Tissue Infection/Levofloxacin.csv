0,Levofloxacin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1.0,,"April 16, 2021",1,"One dose before bed was a mistake. It had me up all night, I got roughly 30 minutes of sleep throughout the night I was having vivid hallucinations and when I would drift off to sleep would have such a vivid dreams that it was miserable. At one point I thought a monkey in a spaceship was trying to scratch my eyes out. I’m never taking it again.",Reviewer

2,Levofloxacin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 24, 2020",3,I'm a 62 year old female who had an MRI on left foot with diagnosis of cellulitis to leg and foot. Prescribed an antibiotic by foot doctor. Cellulitis still present after completion of antibiotic.  He referred me to an Infectious Disease doctor.  I have no open sores. This doctor prescribed Levofloxacin and Doxycycline.  I did read the warning sheet on both and told my family and friends I refuse to take the Levofloxacin.  They talked me into taking it. I took one dose at 750 mg. It gave me a terrible nightmare which I awoke with anxiety. I also could tell my blood sugar was very low. I started walking around and felt pain that went from mid calf down to heel on right foot. I stopped both meds. I now have a painful ankle with shooting pain in my inner foot. I'm going to go to ER to find out if there is tendon damage. I also need an another antibiotic to treat cellulitis.  I should have never taken them. I suffer from Fibromyalgia.  Seriously think twice.,Dee

4,Levofloxacin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1.0,,"July 24, 2020",10,"While working on the house I stepped on a nail. I haven't had a tetanus shot in 17 years so I went to the urgent care. They gave me a shot but the provider said that since they don't know what was on the floor or bottom of my shoe, she wanted to put me on antibiotics (levofloxacin) for 5 days. I never had that with a tetanus shot but figured couldn't hurt to be safe. I was told if I experienced joint pain, that was a problem. Well by about 7 the next night, not only did I have joint pain, but also a fever, stomach cramps, heart was racing and a pounding headache. Could I not trace every symptom back to the side effects, I would be afraid I had Covid, plus I have no respiratory issues. Turns out, what they put me on (Levofloxacin, 750 mg) is what they give to people that have Anthrax and some forms of the plague.....NO JOKE. They also gave me the max dosage. I don't know why they felt the need to go to such extremes but I guess what I am trying to say in all this is, STAY AWAY FROM LEVOFLOXACIN.",Jason

6,Levofloxacin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 4, 2020",1,"I’ve had perichondritis twice in my ear cartilage and it spread one time to infect the side of my face. Neither time was caused by a piercing, but rather a tiny scrap or scratch on my ear. Both times they prescribed me Levoquin and I didn’t have any adverse reactions. I suffer from anxiety and it wasn’t worsened when on this medication. I did rest a lot and refrained from any physical activity. Normal chores and walking around the house were fine.  I also drank a lot of water while taking this medication and avoided dairy.  It took a few days to kick in and both times I didn’t think it was even working until around day 3 or 4.",Anonymous

8,Levofloxacin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 27, 2018",1,"I found this medication to be a rough one. I don't usually have problems with antibiotics like z-pack or doxycycline but this one gave me unrelenting dizziness from the moment I woke till the moment I went to sleep, loss of appetite and ultimately after 5 days of taking it, began to cause feelings of pressure in the back of my head. The doctor seemed quite concerned about the head pressure and switched me over to Cipro which gave me absolutely no side effects at all.On a positive note, this antibiotic did begin working against my pseudomonas skin infection almost immediately. But cipro seemed to worked just as well.",blgriffin83

I was feeling 10x worse.  At first I thought I had the flu.  Headache fever achy all over no energy just weak. Then my shoulder joints started hurting so bad I could cry.  On a pain score 1-10 I was at a 15 and I've had 4 kids and rods in my back.  I contacted the Dr who told me to stop taking this Medication. That iris known for pain in joints.  Well I'm 2 weeks out. Still in pain all the way down both arms.  Sleeping on a heating pad and taking pain medication. My original complaint seems minor compared to this.  Dr says 4-6 weeks to get it out of your system.  I am Miserable. Can't lift my arms.  ,Tina P.

I was prescribed this to take 1 every 12 hours for the first 2 days after that 1 for 8 days for an infected finger. I had a very small cut which I had used antibiotic cream on and it made my finger itch and then swell. There was no pain present and the cut had disappeared however my finger was swollen and very itchy. I went to the hospital urgent care here in Spain and as I am allergic to penicillin I was given the levoflaxcino.
