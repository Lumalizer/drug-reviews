0,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 28, 2021",0,"After taking Augmentin, the very next day, I had the worst migraine of my life. I don’t know how I powered through school but I did. The next day, the migraine was still very present. Woke up and vomited because my head was hurting so bad. I went back to the ER. They hospitalised me after that for four days. Had CT scans and everything. Worst experience ever on Augmentin, that is.",Girl
1,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 22, 2020",9,"Took Augment 10 days twice a day, 875mg. Great experience but did not fully get rid of my stubborn infection. It only made me a little gassy with no other side effects.",anon
2,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 10, 2020",16,"I took augmentin for a nasty stye that was getting increasingly worse.  I do not have a good track record with antibiotics as I have either broken out in hives or it has caused some intolerable mood swings. I was nervous about taking it, but the stye caused me so much pain that I gave in. Hours after the first dose, the stye came to a head and immediately started draining. It felt like so much of the pain had finally left my eye. By day 4, other than the scar/scab, my eye looks and feels like normal. My digestion is a bit out of whack, but I deal with other complicated gastro issues, so this was not a big deal for me. Probiotics and kefir to help!",AllOkay
3,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 31, 2020",16,"I was prescribed Àugmentin (Amox-Clav) 125mg every twelve hours for 10 days. Starting having diarrhea the day I started and by day five I became so sick I thought I was going to have to go to the ER. Horrible stomach pain and cramps, fever, extreme weakness, painful muscles mainly in legs, nasty sweat, nightmares, and I lost my sense of smell...which may have been a good thing since I was pretty much stuck in the bathroom. The fever and pain lasted two days after I stopped taking the augmentin on day five. The diarrhea has continued (on day eight after discontinuing drug) and is pretty much spontaneous. I can’t go anywhere. I have never had stomach issues in my life (I’m 50). I fear my gut is damaged beyond repair. This is a nasty, nasty drug. Also has worsened my depression and mental state in general.",Lacey
4,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 21, 2020",19,"I had a stye that turned into cellulitis with extreme swelling, redness and pain. If you google the most extreme pics of periorbital cellulitis, I looked worse than those. My lower eyelid was so swollen that it was projected so far out that when I closed my eye, my inside tissue, the mucous membrane was completely exposed. It felt like my skin was ripping apart. I was prescribed 1000mg Augmentin and after the first tablet, I was about 25% better. After the second tablet, all pain was gone and it went down to looking like a normal stye again. This was in just 24 hours. By the end of day 3 you'd never know it happened. I've also been prescribed Augmentin for bronchitis and respiratory infections and it's quick and works great for those as well.",Riley
5,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 23, 2020",10,"I was prescribed Augmentin for what my doctor thought was a skin infection on my right leg. Well after taking my first dose within 2 hours my stomach became extremely upset... burning...nausea... diarrhea....bloating...and anxiety and panic has always been a issue for me but after Augmentin it was immediately 20 times worse. My Dr ended up telling me to stop taking it on day 5 cause it was getting worse and worse. My skin infection cleared up with some hydrocortisone cream and antibiotic ointment but its been over 3 months since stopping this med and I'm still having major stomach issues and mental isses, so please be careful people especially if you have anxiety or stomach issues before hand.",Bethel
6,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 22, 2019",4,"When I received a shot of Novacaine at the dentist for one of my front teeth, it seems he hit the nerve going from the gums into my nose. My left nostril swelled so that it look like a pig nose and was extremely sore to the touch. After three days on the Augmentin, all the pain is gone and the swelling has come down to about half its original size, so my nose looks normal. I was particularly worried because I had to perform in two concerts two days after my first dose. The infection formed scabbing on both the outside and inside of the nostril. A little cover-up applied to the outside got me through both concerts. Still have swelling inside but it’s doable. High marks for this antibiotic.",USAMaid
7,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 3, 2019",13,"I started this 6 days ago for an infection for a knife cut on my thumb knuckle. It seemed to work and swelling is down however I was advised to stop using it due to the side effects. Severe nausea upon waking, chills, agitation, unable to keep still yet tired, lightheaded and fatigued. The panic attacks and constant catastrophic thinking really made me need to stop this med. I hope it killed the infection because I think I may need a medicated coma for my next round",Murphy

10,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10,,"March 20, 2019",3,Augmentin has been a saving grace for my acne. It works so great when NOTHING else works. Unfortunately over the years it has lost its effectiveness. 10 years ago I would take  a course and have clear skin for months. Now a full coarse of aug 875mg will only last a few weeks after taking it before the unbearable itch and painful acne appear. Not sure what step to take next...,Cuzo
11,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 14, 2018",34,I feel like the people that come on here to read reviews are people like me who have anxieties about taking medications. I needed this medication for a skin infection after my c section. I was nervous about the symptoms after reading the comments on here but I had ZERO problems with this medication. I was prescribed 875mg 2x daily. I made sure I ate a pro-biotic yogurt before starting this med and had one every day for 7 days until I was finished. I had no upset stomach or diarrhea.,Gi

I've now been diagnosed with colitis from augmentin.I'm more sick after the course than I was before I actually needed the antibiotics!!I've never had a reaction to any other antibiotic so would never ever take that again.",nauseousgirl
13,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,1,,"September 15, 2017",11,"Took this for 10 days after a cat bite got infected.  Noticed hyperactivity during the course, but it was two days after I finished the course that the real fun started - fatigue, head fog, inability to do anything, weight loss (three kg in four days!), really bad insomnia (unable to sleep until 5 am), unable to stomach anything except carbs.  After a week of this the nausea started, so that I couldn't eat anything without debilitating nausea.  Headaches too.  Am still in it after two weeks.  Treating myself with ginger tea for nausea, slippery elm, probiotics, dandelion leaf and root for liver, lemon water, vegetable juices.  I  will never take this again.",catbite
14,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,2,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 3, 2017",2,This med was given as a result of a deep gouge from a dog nail. Healing was not occurring after 4 weeks including a trip to a ambulatory care. My doc said they treated it incorrectly. He prescribed this. I have an appointment at the wound center Tues.  Dr also said it needed debriding. After 5 days I see no improvement. If anything the area is more red and sore.,Anonymous
15,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 28, 2017",13,"I've been taking this for about two weeks to combat cellulitis and after first trying Keflex and Bactrim which did not work, the Augmentin is working quite well.I haven't had any stomach upset or GI discomfort. I haven't had any Diarrhea that couldn't be easily stopped with a normal dose of over-the-counter Loperamide. Had a slight bit but the Loperamide fixed that right up.",Adam Mann

Headache, gassiness, bloating, stomach upset from day one. Horrible vomiting on day 5. Thank goodness I only have 7 day Rx. Calling Dr tomorrow and will beg not to take last 2 days or switch to something else.",Anonymous
17,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 20, 2016",9,"I had an external ear infection for almost 18 days, on my first check up the doctor prescribed Clindamycin, but that didn't work on me. About 2 weeks later i still have no signs off healing through Clindamycin, I decided to be checked-up again with different doctor (ENT) & I was diagnosed with Chondritis. He prescribed Augmentin 625mg, 3x a day, every 8hrs. and Inoflox, which is also an antibiotic for twice a day. I experienced side effects such as diarrhea that lasted only on 2nd day. I just realized  that this side effect are temporary. Now i am on my 4th day on these antibiotics, i can say that im healing and my ear forms back again to its normal size.",Alex Celine
18,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 18, 2016",10,"I was prescribed Augmentin 875(?) to be taken twice a day for 10 days to try and prevent infection from a bad cat bite. I did experience symptoms, but because I suffer from IBS it mostly seemed like an IBS flare to me. The looser stools started on day two, but they were not diarrhea. That was it until around day 8 when I bloated like you wouldn't believe. It was all up in my stomach and nothing gave me relief. However, I continued on taking my pills and my probiotics and finished a couple of days ago. The side effects were not pleasant, but they were much less unfortunate than I was expecting after reading reviews. I never got an infection from the cat bite, which normally leads to one in about 80% of people. So, the drug worked!",Boymama

20,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,3,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 25, 2016",13,"I was prescribed this twice a day for 7 days. I'm halfway through and I recently developed severe headaches, decreased appreciate, decreased urination, and shortness of breath. No diahrrea yet, but I did feel nauseous this morning. I hope not to get diahrrea because I'm trying to heal an anal fissure. I tested negative for some common STDs so I don't know what I have but my groin lymph nodes still seem to be swollen. :/",SadBirdie
21,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,5,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 11, 2016",9,"I took this medicine for a tooth abscess that couldn't be drained during root canal. Severe diarrhea, headaches, minor heartburn and I felt as though my throat were closing (doc said minor allergic reaction). I have been taking a probiotic and eating yogurt but it hasn't helped with the stomach upset at all.  It helped with the abscess but 8 days later it isn't completely cleared. I've been switched to Clindamycin due to the tightening in my throat. Scared to death and sick of antibiotics.",Tired of antibiotics
22,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,7,,"February 12, 2016",11,"Was prescribed the 875 mg tabs every 12 hours for an infected cyst. Right from the 1st dose I experienced stomach upset, severe bloating, and Diarrhea that burned. Within several days I also developed a vaginal yeast infection and severe yeast rashes in both armpits.  I normally have a cast iron stomach and can take normally any medication without meals and have no problems.  The augmentin caused bad side effects even with meals.  Stay away from this drug it is well known to cause stomach problems.",KathyM76

I have redness, welt type acne, rash type scne, black/white heads on my face.

26,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,8,,"December 27, 2014",52,"Overall, not too bad.  Had some mild nausea and diarrhea the first two or three days, but then drank Kefir which helped immensely.  Be sure to take as directed with some food (you don't need a whole meal) and eat yogurt etc.  I highly recommend Kefir during Augmentin therapy.  Began clearing the infection by the second day.  Remember, most people have little to no side effects with these medications, so what you tend to read on the Internet is negatively biased.",JoeyJoJo
27,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,7,,"October 26, 2010",30,"I have used Augmentin several times mainly for skin infection (acne) and had found it effective although I took only half course of 7 tabs x 625mg on each occasion. So far I have experienced no sight effects. I also increased my probiotics intake while on this antibiotic. The probiotics should not be taken at same time but after a lapse of time, say four hours or longer after consuming the drug. I would recommend Augmentin as it is effective and to me there is no side effect.",wh7352

29,Augmentin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,10,,"July 1, 2008",44,"I suffered from Pseudofolliculitis behind my head for years and by chance I got Augmentin from Libya without any prescription. In Europe all the doctors that I consulted could not find solution for this problem so one day I just worked into a pharmacy in Libya and showed it to the Doctor in charge of the pharmacy who adviced me to take Augmentin. I was a bit hesitant but before my returning date (after 5 days) I noticed that all the bumps are drying.and now I'm very proud of my head.",Anonymous
