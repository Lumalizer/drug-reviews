0,Hytrin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,,"May 16, 2015",40,"I have been on Hytrin for at last 20 years. Started at 1 mg. daily. It helped my flow immediately. Now at the age of 84 I am on 15 mg. It still works pretty well. I have occasionally had episodes of low blood pressure leading to dizziness but I'm not sure whether that it from Hytrin or other blood pressure medicine I take. My blood pressure seems to fluctuate a lot. Again, I don't know the cause(s).",Chazuu
1,Hytrin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,4,,"November 27, 2013",32,"I have been taking this for night trips to the bathroom .Started a 3mg  2 years ago and just started slowly increasing to 10mg. I stopped taking due to the side effects of rapid pounding heart beat, chest pains, dizziness, no real change in sexual functions which is good thing. Not a big change in night trips to the bathroom.Off to the Doctor today.",T/R

3,Hytrin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,3,,"March 27, 2012",40,"Using 10 mg/night for the last two months - it works okay but side effects include low libido, and a very noticeable reduction in endurance and muscle strength. As a distance runner - age 50 my performance is severely impacted running and in bed. Going to ask my Doctor to try something else.",Anonymous
4,Hytrin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,3,,"August 20, 2011",32,"I am 50yo and was on 1-4mg Hytrin for 7 months for urinary retention and disliked it. It barely made a dent in my symptoms, and made me tired and fatigued - muscles always felt weak, was frequently irritable and interfered with my sleep. Took forever to build up to 4mg. However, I still had a libido with few sexual side effect, which was a very nice surprise. Recommend trying it to see if it works even though it's one of the older alpha-blockers.",Good Luck!

After a couple weeks or so the side effects were so bad I had to stop taking it. Intense headaches, nausea. It was unpleasant.
