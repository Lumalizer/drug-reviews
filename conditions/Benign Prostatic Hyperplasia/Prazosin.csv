3,Prazosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8,,"November 19, 2009",94,"Minipress (prazosin):I am 66 and have been taking 1 mg of Minipress/prazosin per day for BPH for at least 25 years.  It works well with minimal side effects.  I still get up about 1x per night to urinate but the stream is reasonably strong and I can fully empty my bladder.  Missing a dose for 2 or 3 days results in noticeable degradation of initiation, stream flow and complete emptying of bladder.  Some years ago I tried Cardura which had more impact on the BPH symptoms, but had unacceptable side effects on potency and desire.  Minipress is available as a generic and for me is a superior solution.",Anonymous
