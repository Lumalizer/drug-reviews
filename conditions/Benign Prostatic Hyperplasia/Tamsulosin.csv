1,Tamsulosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,,,"February 24, 2022",1,"At age 76 was put on this drug some 3 months ago for elevated PSA levels and frequency of urination - particularly at night. It certainly reduced the frequency of night time urinations and dropped my PSA levels to the high end of normal.However - the side effects, noting that I still compete at State National and International level in cycling with wins at both State & National level. The first noted side effect was extreme lethargy first thing in the morning. On the bike muscle soreness to the point it was affecting performance, finding it difficult to get an av. power output above 170 watts. Heart rate would go to about 140-145 and to move it past there took a herculean effort. Would take at least 2-3 days to get over a session such as this. With reference to the doctor went off them for 2  weeks. Toward the end of that 2 week period could take HR to 160 and av power output of 214 watts. Would be over that within 36 hours. This drug certainly affects athletic performance.",Anonymous

3,Tamsulosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 11, 2022",1,"Flomax (tamsulosin):I was prescribed this after finding out I have rather early onset BPH. I'm only 30, I was given this drug as a trial of a week, and I was afraid it'd make me lose bladder control or something so I put off taking it for a bit, but decided the effects of BPH were annoying enough to finally try it. While I'm happy to report that, I did not pee myself, I am unhappy to report that it didn't really help either. It's really hard to tell, and I am trying to be fair, because from the second I took this pill, I have felt like I have a horrible flu. My head hurts, my teeth ache, my body is fatigued. I couldn't even masturbate to pass the time because of this drug. I would take a pass on this drug unless you are absolutely desperate. I would have very much liked to tell you the pros and cons after a week, but I won't be taking a second pill.",Whatever

6,Tamsulosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,2.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 12, 2022",0,"I was taking Flomax for about 8 years, I was told I had an enlarged Prostate, but I had no problem peeing, or any other symptoms. Since I started taking it, I had back pain 24/7, no ejaculation, feeling sleepy all the time, dizziness. I stopped taking Flomax about 45 days ago, I gradually weaned myself off them, within a few days after stopping Flomax, my back pain is pretty much gone, I have pain if I try to over do it, I’m 70! So naturally I can’t do the things I could when I was 30, but overall I feel much better, I have more energy, I don’t need an afternoon nap anymore, I actually feel like I’m 30. Anyone who is considering stopping Flomax, I would do it slowly. So far so good, I still get up to pee a couple of times a night, but I think that’s because my wife is always making soup, and I generally wake around 2am  to use the bathroom, but I’ve never had a problem with slow stream! Actually quite the opposite.",JohnE

I mean it was so bad I couldn't talk, then I mentioned it my neighbor an he said he had to stop taking it because of that same reason. I didn't stop taking it, however when I spoke to my dr about it he said to cut back on the dose so I take it twice a week not everyday I still have the same side-effects but not as bad.",Frank
8,Tamsulosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 23, 2021",0,"I am kind of frustrated with dr. Reading tons after he gave me this drug and wanted me to add Finasteride 2 weeks after (which says can increase prostate cancer.. uh this what I am trying to avoid.. its like depression meds giving suicidal thoughts :/ ) So I was doing well with saw palmetto natural stuff I been taking for months, which has made it so I don’t wake up to pee and only if I drink a beer  then I need to go lots. I carry a big glass jar in my car to go pee. I am ok with it and not these side effects. I felt like if any car stopped quickly i might of not been able to react in time. The thing I don’t get, like saw palemento , it says support .. neither of them say heal.. so why do I need to take it, if I am happy with what’s going on. I am stopping it and doing CT scan to look into more, since it is not healing really just helping support healthier prostate idk…no info makes me feel like wow this I need.",Natural guy
9,Tamsulosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 5, 2021",0,"Flomax (tamsulosin):I was prescribed Flomax to handle the prostatic stimulation from testosterone replacement therapy. Initially, I did experience the lack of ejaculation, all of it.   I simply dealt with it for a while; but then, I began taking it AT NIGHT BEFORE BED.   Not only did this remove the side effect, things have started flowing much more normally.   I mentioned this to my doc and his response was ""why didn't I think of that"".So, to those who are experiencing this, perhaps talk with your doctor about taking Flomax at night before bed/sleep.  Or simply try it, if you feel comfortable doing so.I don't believe the research supports Flomax as a cause for ED or orgasm disorders -- this part of your body is very complex.  Other medications, reactions should be considered.   Also: taking NSAIDs or pain relievers like Tylenol can affect orgasm.  Go figure, but in older people it can.I hope this info helps someone :)",forrie
10,Tamsulosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 26, 2021",0,This is a miracle cure for me. My doctor told give it a month before you see any effects but it was after the very first tablet. Two years of struggling to urinate and bang the complete opposite after being on them. The only side effects I’ve had was stuffy nose through the night a few times a little light headed but I’ll take that for urinating like a kid again. I’m back to my energetic ways and my wife can believe the instant changes. Highly recommend this product. 10/10,Chris
11,Tamsulosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 25, 2021",0,"Had a really nasty UTI that was cleared after 2 weeks on Ciprofloxacin. It left me with acute prostatitis and urinary difficulties. Saw the urologist and she said all looked normal from the urine sample, but she put me on .4mg tamsulosin daily (generic Flomax). I had read about all of the potential side effects, but REALLY needed relief. 2 days in, and it does seem to have helped. No more urgency or trouble emptying. The most inconvenient thing is taking it 30 minutes after the same meal each day but I understand why. NOT doing that will increase the concentration in your bloodstream much quicker and can lead to serious side effects. I had also been suffering with ED. She prescribed 25 mg sildenafil as needed with a STERN warning to avoid taking the two less than 4 hours apart. I'm also on 100-25 mg of Losartan-HCTZ so the last thing I need is a sudden drop in BP! Worst side effect so far is thin and almost clear semen. Libido is lower overall, but that's OK. Still some ED as well.",Cowboy78

First couple of doses caused severe nausea (get Zofran from doc and take with Flomax for about 5days) also tiredness and light headedness.  I found improvement with taking the med about an hour before bedtime.  Symptoms much more tolerable. I think the only real sexual side effect was reduced erection.  If you can't pee and I couldn't due to taking testosterone, which caused BPH.  I took saw palmetto successfully for 3 years then had to stop for surgery. Saw palmetto did not work once I resumed.",P55

16,Tamsulosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 28, 2021",1,Flomax (tamsulosin):All this does is make sure the bladder gets empty. It has no medical effect on the prostate & ruins your sex life with just one pill a day. After six years of taking it I've stopped & started using over the counter prostate supplements which I feel is better than flomax. If flomax is the best for mens prostate health then we're all doomed.,Willy53

Initially paid little attention to side effects since they are published as normal. In hindsight my systems got worse because of it. Bouts of minor incontinence (I believe it ‘relaxed’ the bladder too much), tiredness even upon waking & never feeling rested, sleeplessness, PM chills (more like freezing in the middle of the night), rashes, gum sensitivity, hoarseness.  I  cold turkey stopped taking it. Best move I’ve made in a while! Knock on wood all symptoms have eased or disappeared. I actually believe ‘my condition’ has improved!",Share
18,Tamsulosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10.0,,"September 13, 2021",2,Flomax (tamsulosin):This medicine made my going to the bathroom less frequent and it improved  my dripping issues when I felt done but I was not empty. I was concerned about the ejaculation issues which do occur but there is a positive effect. If you don’t take it everyday and a lay off it a day or two before you know you ar egoing to have sex it can actually increase your ejaculation level and length to a new heightened level. I was surprised when the ejaculations lasted for 10-15 seconds at full sensitivity. It more than made up for the few weak ones. Who knows maybe I am just lucky but at 57 I am having some out of this world releases. Don’t get me wrong I still get the occasional poof and nothing but holding off for a day or two is my secret to happiness and still being able to pee.  My wife now jokes that I am done so stop acting like your still going. But I really am and I think she is a little jealous.,Brian

The sexual side effects should by now be well known and doctors and pharmacists should be discussing but sometimes fail to do so.  Flomax is very seldom given to young men, commonly it is given to those 50+.  If you are sexually active the side effects can be problematic.  If you are not sexually active the sexual side effects can be a good thing.  I fall into the latter category and a diminished libido, combined with a gentler ejaculation is a good thing.But, after being on Flomax continually for about a week, the back and joint pain starts.  Not good.  The nasal congestion and headaches also not good.I discussed with my doctor, she suggested that I try taking it every second day.  So far so good.",Islanddave

I  was provoked to urinate almost 30 times in 24 hours. It’s a gut punch -squeeze on your innards to get urine out, with forced straining, grimacing. It is hard to describe the discomfort / pain, and it lingers a little after. The genitals are sensitized by this drug. More sensitive  than before, not good. Just no. After speaking to nurses and pharmacists (who went back and forth on this ) I stopped after 3 doses. I used sleeping pills to sleep through most of the last 3 nights.

I take it along with Avodart.  Sexual desire is somewhat reduced but as I'm 56 and my wife is no longer interested in sex [its been a few years since we last had sex] that is not such a bad thing.  When masturbating, orgasm is very gentle, more a mental experience than a physical one with no pulsing contractions and no semen comes out.  On the positive side, my libido is no longer so urgent, I masturbate much less and there is no longer a tight aching sensation when I abstain from masturbating.  Overall, it is a good medication to be on if you are no longer sexually active and or if you would like to reduce or even give up masturbation.",islandguy

Went off the drug because of that. Several years later a doctor in Thailand told me to take half the dose. This year I acquired full medical insurance and began taking Flomax again. Since the minimum dose is 0.4, I break open the capsule and take only half at a time. This has worked wonders, as I feel like urination (and the flow during ejaculation) is back to where it was maybe 10 years ago, and I have absolutely no side effects (despite being very sensitive to medications in general) .

This is a very unconfortable feeling, as you feel that sperm remains somewhere inside you (later I found by reading that it goes in the bladder).
