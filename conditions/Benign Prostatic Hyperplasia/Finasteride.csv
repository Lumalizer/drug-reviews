I have been on a downward trend, self-admitted to hospital for a week on the beach depression , anxiety off the charts, everyday was a push. Hard to smile, couldn't barely get hard at all, didn't care about caring. Hair has been growing in thick. Off this stuff for a month keep the hair give me back my life and joy and undo all the damage to me. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION. More than likely the people pushing it aren't taking it.

1,Finasteride,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 16, 2022",2,"I’m 76 years old with an enlarged prostrate. As urination became more difficult my doctor prescribed finasteride. He gave me no verbal warning but I read the  side effects on the prescription instructions. It did say  may affect sexual desire."" I trusted my doctor and thought it was just one of those extreme warning we see all the time.  I took the medication for six months on a daily basis. After six months I became to realize my erection was difficult to achieve.  I continued to take the medication thinking the problem was age related no the medication. After 6 more months I was unable to achieve an erection at all and unable to have an orgasm!  My prostrate did shrink but so did my penis and testicles! At the gym I was embarrassed by my small penis which shrank to half the size it was before taking the medication!  My first alarm was when I was unable to achieve orgasm by oral sex regardless of how long I tried!",Neal
2,Finasteride,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 23, 2021",3,"If your taking this poison for hair growth, I urge you to stop! Bald is better than the side effects. I took it for enlarged prostate but decided it wasn't a good option. I'm 71 so ED isn't an issue for me BUT after two months I started getting headaches that wouldn't go away. Then 4 days into the headaches I woke up to dizzy. I'm not talking a little dizzy, I'm talking big time spinning room dizzy that felt like the worst drunk of a life dizzy. I was 24 hours before I could walk to the bathroom without falling. I'm reading that only 2% experience the side effects. I'm betting it is a lot higher than that. Stop NOW and hope you get better. It has been a month since I took any and I am still having light headed days and minor headaches. Hopefully this isn't permanent.",Monty

I was terrified at first to take it due to the side effects I read about.  At first I tried several supplement pills but they all didn't work.  Then I tried Flomax but made my nose stuffy. Then Tried Cialis but it gave me flu type symptoms. Unfortunately after 11 months I see little improvement.  However, it seems my stream is a little stronger when I urinate but I still get up multiple times to urinate.  But having insomnia doesn't help either.Fortunately, I have had zero side effects using Finasteride which I'm happy about.  Absolutely no effect on my sex life.I'll continue taking it for the next several months to see if I needed a year to see any improvement but I'm doubtful.

Side effects with me were I believe an increase in the growth of body hair and nails. Other things I felt were related to the drug was a decrease in activity and exercise and really strange was weight gain noticeably especially around the waistline. Since I stopped taking it, the activity level is back to normal and so is the waistline. However, the urine stream has diminished accordingly. Additional side effects were reduction in semen production and somewhat of a lower sexual appetite coupled with decreased erections and duration of them. The semen was also much clearer and of water-like in appearance. After I stopped taking it, everything returned to normal again.",Jim
