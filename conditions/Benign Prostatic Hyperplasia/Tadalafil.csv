2,Tadalafil,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 17, 2022",0,"I'm 54 and have experienced increasing ED problems over the past 2 years. In November I was diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer and also have BPH which is the cause of my ED. I'm not having any treatment beyond active surveillance and luckily have only mild symptoms (increase in frequency but that's it. No night time disturbance, etc). Annual health screening detected the cancer / BPH. Started taking daily 5mg Tadalafil in November and the results are superb. No side effects, except when combined with alcohol I sometimes get a stuffy nose. Erections are very strong and sex is very pleasurable again. (Being circumcised it does seem to flare out the glans a bit more.) I've also seen a reduction in frequency of urination. Really pleased with the drug which working well for me.",CMM

It worked very well for both the first day, but then I started to develop severe back pain so that I could hardly stand up.  I discontinued for 2 days taking Aleve, but then cut the pill down (use a sharp knife) to 2.5mg each morning and that works just fine.  So far, I need to urinate maybe once in the night, don't have the crazy urgency in the day, and enjoy erections and orgasms whenever I want to.  Ejaculation is super strong and productive.  Previously I had tried Flomax, but all that did was create more ED.  Extremely happy with Cialis at 2.5mg each morning.  Taking L-Arginine every evening doesn't hurt either.",Bulldog

Prior to Tadafil, I was getting up 3-4 times a night to pee and if I had an urge while standing, I could not avoid leaking urine. After I took Tadafil, my night frequency was reduced to once, even no need to get up to urinate. I have started to sleep through the night which has provided me more energy during the. day. My erections became much stronger and that is a problem, since my wife has become asexual since menopause.",David Sandpoet

I buy 200 pills at a time at 23 cents a pill for 20mg that I split in half to take. It costs more for the FedEx than the generic Cialis.

So I had to quit the Cialis for a few days to get it out of my system. Then started one half of a pill, every other day thinking that I will increase as need. Well never needed to increase.  Another words a quarter dose. And great results! Only get up once a night to pee!  First time for that in decades.  Also although didn’t have a lot of problems with erections for my age, 75, Yes it did improve that too. With just a quarter dose. And NO side effects.
