1,Terazosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 27, 2021",0,Constant headaches and mental paralysis could not move or get up . that was with 2 mgIt suddenly stopped working at all. Side effects were horrific and withdrawal symptoms worse than opiates could hardly think or move for 2 weeks.  I found Cialis worked without side effects,Pedro
2,Terazosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 16, 2020",6,"Started Terazosin at 1mg dose, then increased 2mg, then 5mg , for about about 2 years.  It worked fine for that period of time, minimal side effects, until it started losing effectiveness.  Doc increased dosage to 10 mg and that’s when the problems started. Itching , which led to a bad rash on my back, grogginess in the morning lasting until 10 -11AM, loss of appetite, lack of energy, tiredness, stuffy nose. I put up with the side effects for about a year, because the results were good, and it normalized my BPH symptoms.  I really thought there was something wrong with me.I complained to my doctor, asking him if I could try 7mg....instead he put me on Flomax 0.4 mg. Have been on this for about 10 days...very few side effects, but up to now it’s useless for the reasons I’m taking it....weak stream, stop and go flow, getting up 4+ times a night to pee...making me wonder why I’m even bothering talking it..",RT
3,Terazosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 26, 2020",4,"I started terazosin at 2mg, went to 5 mg, as it was losing effectiveness. Stayed with 5mg for about three years. Am currently taking 10mg .I’ve had some minor side effects such as a rash on my back, nasal stuffiness. Main problem is drowsiness, after I wake up in the morning and lasting sometimes until 10-11 AM.I’m going to ask my doctor if we can decrease to about 7 mg , to see if that helps with the drowsiness problem. Otherwise.... it works well with my urinating flow, and frequency problem .",Anonymous
4,Terazosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10.0,,"January 27, 2020",7,"This was the 4th medication I tried for BPH, which had me getting up several times throughout the night. We started with 1mg, which had no effect. Bumping it to 5mg did the trick and I know get up only twice and am sleeping much better. I’ve also noticed an improvement in urinary flow.

6,Terazosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 30, 2018",11,"I had a terrible experience with Terazosin... though it worked quickly for my BPH, the side effects were alarming enough to send me to emergency... SUPER rapid heart rate, nausea and stomach pain, mostly upon rising... now I have significant abdominal distension and have lost 20 lbs in 3 months all due to lack of appetite and ulcer-like stomach pain...  related?  I would think so.",JJ
7,Terazosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 14, 2017",9,"I was put on this for IC -- Interstitial Cystitis.  I had been taking Ditropan, but was still having symptoms even after adjusting my diet, so my Urologist tried adding Hytrin, and the combination really worked for me.   I took these for several years, and finally was able to wean myself off both medications and with following a strict diet, I am mostly symptom-free.  I feel that it was the two drugs that allowed my bladder to finally stop spasming, and kind of ""reset"". This drug was literally a life-saver.",Anonymous

10,Terazosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8.0,,"May 16, 2015",40,"Hytrin (terazosin):I have been on Hytrin for at last 20 years. Started at 1 mg. daily. It helped my flow immediately. Now at the age of 84 I am on 15 mg. It still works pretty well. I have occasionally had episodes of low blood pressure leading to dizziness but I'm not sure whether that it from Hytrin or other blood pressure medicine I take. My blood pressure seems to fluctuate a lot. Again, I don't know the cause(s).",Chazuu
11,Terazosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 2, 2015",25,"I was taking 1mg of Doxazosin, for about a year, for my urine stream.  I went off this and went to Terazosin, when the Doxazosin became unavailable.  Taking 1mg of Terazosin, for 3 months worked very well, a strong urine stream and sexual functions were improved, the best in a few years. Then the product became unavailable an was put on 0.4 mg of Tamsulosin, within 15 days my urine stream and sexual functions reverted back to 4 months prior.  I complained to my doctor and found another pharmacy selling Terazosin.  I have been on the pill for 3 days and waiting for the product to adjust to previous levels.  Remember if it works, don't change, you'll be disappointed.",Frank 57 yrs old

I stopped taking due to the side effects of rapid pounding heart beat, chest pains, dizziness, no real change in sexual functions which is good thing.

14,Terazosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,10.0,,"October 8, 2013",40,"I've taken this for about nine years now.  I went from 2mg. per day at the start, to 5mg per day two years ago. It really works for me.  If I miss the evening dose, I notice decreased flow about twelve hours later. That's a huge motivation, so I rarely miss a dose.  No noticeable side effects.",Hammerdog47

18,Terazosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,8.0,,"August 22, 2011",35,"Terazosin controls my somewhat high blood pressure and moderately improves my benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms at 5mg, 3X/day.  I have found that just missing one dose (after 8-10 hrs after last dose) reduces urinary flow rate, but still a bit above flow before taking this medicine.  I am not experiencing any significant side effects, unless I take terazosin in conjunction with muscle relaxant for arthritis pain in back and neck pain. Then I have experienced some dizziness and low blood pressure. I have read that it may take a couple of months before full effects on urinary symptoms occur.  I have been taking terazosin for about 1-1/2 months at this dosage with little difference in the past month in flow.I previously tried doxazosin and tamsulosin with allergic side effects.",dockc
19,Terazosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,5.0,,"August 22, 2011",26,It worked quite well at 1 mg a night for 3 years helping me urinate like a real man until 6 months ago when my flow rate began decreasing and the symptoms of urinary retention started reappearing.  We increased the dosage to 2 mg and I was back to normal.  Then the troubles urinating re-emerged and doctor upped it to 4 mg a night 3 weeks ago. Again I saw immediate improvement but over the weekend I've gone back to long bathroom struggles getting anything out.  Am now awaiting the scheduling of a urodynamic study to get to the bottom of this.,Anonymous
20,Terazosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,3.0,,"August 20, 2011",32,"Hytrin (terazosin):I am 50yo and was on 1-4mg Hytrin for 7 months for urinary retention and disliked it. It barely made a dent in my symptoms, and made me tired and fatigued - muscles always felt weak, was frequently irritable and interfered with my sleep. Took forever to build up to 4mg. However, I still had a libido with few sexual side effect, which was a very nice surprise. Recommend trying it to see if it works even though it's one of the older alpha-blockers.",Good Luck!
