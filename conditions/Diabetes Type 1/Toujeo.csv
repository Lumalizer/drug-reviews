0,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 1, 2021",5,"No. Just no.I haven't had the ""unpredictable"" that others have had. To me, it's very predictable; it doesn't work.And I mean, BGL (blood glucose levels) behaviour as if I had injected water under the skin. Nothing. Needing to wake up every two hours through the night to inject bolus correction, like some kind of human insulin pump.Toujeo, or rather ""the glorified water"", is a hard no.",Am
1,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 21, 2020",4,"Do NOT use Toujeo SoloStar for diabetes treatment. I have been using this insulin for more than half a year now, and I can say with certainty: Toujeo SoloStar is dangerous.My rating is 2, because using it is still better than dying without insulin(I have type 1 diabetes). Although I do not understand how this product has been approved for use. I have diabetes for more than 20 years now, and not once have I experienced a base insulin misbehave so much as the Toujeo SoloStar.The effects range from severe hyperglycemia (> 20 mMol/L) to persistent hypoglycemia (< 3.0 mMol/L). Persistent, because even eating 60g of carbohydrates barely raises my blood sugar level. So basically this thing is unpredictable.After some searching I found that I am not the only one experiencing the above problems.TL;DR Do NOT use Toujeo SoloStar, its effects are unpredictable.",Attila
2,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 13, 2020",4,"After being diagnosed with Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) in March of 2019 I was given this drug and Humolog for meal dosing. I have good experiences with Toujeo SoloStar for 3 weeks at a time then sugars go crazy ups and downs. So I would change pens way earlier then is prescribed and sugars would be fine for awhile. First box I got said good for 28 days now they say 56 days. Well not so, only good for at least 3 weeks then have too discard and open new pen. Hope this info helps someone.",Algania
3,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,2.0,,"March 13, 2020",6,"35 year, type 1 for 5 years, was using Toujeo. In my case, Toujeo induced defensive responses, which caused unexplainable high BGs. Eg. went to bed with BG 100 and woke up with BG 270. I thought it was a rebound (Somogyi) effect or excessive DP. When I bought a CGM it revealed that the jumps occur abruptly, with no apparent reason, in the middle of the night or in the afternoon (after 10 - 15 hours from bedtime injection, when Toujeo reaches peak activity). In the final weeks, Toujeo caused me heartburn, accelerated and irregular heatbeat and shaking. My BG was in the range between 200 and 300, and bolus corrections had no lowering effect. In fact, Toujeo increased my BG, which is clear evidence of drug rejection. At the end, went to the ER with BG 450 and received NovoRapid infusion which bought me down to BG 100. Before, I took 25-30 units of Toujeo while now am on 14-16 units of Tresiba. I think I was Toujeo resistant from the very start but things escalated in the last months.",Rinno
4,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 18, 2019",19,"My endo switched me from Lantus to Toujeo about 8 weeks ago. It has been a disaster for me ever since switching. I have extreme highs and lows. I go to bed with blood sugar normal and wake up with it approaching 275 or higher. Occasionally I have a high blood sugar and will take a humalog correction, OFTEN with no effect. I constantly have high blood sugars for most of the day. This did not happen when I was taking Lantus. Now the only times I can have steady blood sugars on Toujeo is when I don’t eat! This is unacceptable! I do agree with some other comments here: Toujeo is a substandard insulin and should be taken off the market IMMEDIATELY! BTW, I am a  type1 diabetic since 1977. Toujeo is terrible!!!!",Dextor
5,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 20, 2019",13,I have been on Toujeo for two weeks and my sugars have been disappointing to say the least! My sugar was 113 @ BT and waking was 260!!!  I have to take way too much N to cover my blood sugar during the day/ after meals to makeup for the Toujeo not effectively working! My chest has been hurting from stressing out & my blood sugars have been so unstable with this new insulin. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TOUJEO FOR ANY TYPE 1 DIABETICS! PLEASE REMOVE FROM SHELF AND SAVE LIVES.,Totally Blue
6,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 25, 2018",13,"Blood sugars have never been more off the chart than since I switched to toujeo, going from extreme highs to dangerous lows and going to bed with normal blood sugar and get up with it through the roof. DISASTER",Honeybee
7,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 22, 2018",13,Have  used Toujeo for 7 months. It does NOTHING! Use greater amounts of Humalog. Really don't like toujeo at all!,Mimi
8,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 21, 2018",8,"A little background: I’m a T1 diabetic who’s successfully used pens forever. I’m also a medical student and like to tinker with my prescriptions when I learn new stuff. I had been on a split-dose of Lantus for years and had given decludec (Tresiba) a shot with frustrating results. I was tired of the split Lantus, so I opted to give Toujeo a try – my endo advised me that many of her patients liked Tresiba better, but I had the exact opposite experience. My A1Cs went from 6.9 to 6.5 to 6.3 while on Toujeo… it hasn’t been 6.3 since high school! At first, my Toujeo dose was lower than the Lantus dose I’d been on, but I experienced the two-month bump I’d read about – basically, I had to increase back up to my old Lantus dose after 2 months. Only other downside is that the pen tips seem to get clogged more easily… which just reminds me that I should be changing them out more often anyway! Very, very happy with Toujeo overall.",LBishop
9,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,,,"January 16, 2018",3,"Like it, however, since their is no generic, it cost an arm and a leg.  In the type 1 and 2 world, we need those.  I have been on it for approximately 3 years, and noticed that my blood sugar is more stable overnight, however, upon waking BS raise fast, which then I use humalog.  I'm 32 years old, type 1 at 5.6",Sherm1
10,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,,"December 25, 2017",15,"Do not use this insulin! It needs to be recalled asap! The first few months I was on it were fabulous, rock steady blood sugars. Last week all of a sudden it stopped working for me. I tried multiple batches and this was not a refrigeration or site injection issue. Other type ones have gone through this same issue. There is an article on diabetes daily toujeo-insulin-the-problem-i-had-with-this-insulinI understand that some may enjoy it, as I did, but it is unpredictable and not safe for use. How this is even on the market is beyond me. Do not use!",Elly H
11,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,2.0,,"February 27, 2017",13,"My blood sugars had been somewhat erratic, so my doctor suggested switching me from Lantus to Toujeo.  The only benefit I've found with Toujeo is the ease with which the insulin injects (my Lantus pens took more effort to push).  My sugars are more consistent now, but they are consistently high.  I am hoping that this is just an adjustment period, but based upon the other negative reviews I've read, I don't think so.  I expect that I'll be switching back to Lantus.",Tbbxny
12,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 23, 2016",13,"I try to change every thing. The dose, the hour, it was à nightmare. After 4 months of high suger i go back to lantus.",Eddy02
13,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 10, 2016",4,Sanofi advertises a savings card to get it for $15 for 1 year. Unfortunately this is not true and they may give it to you for that amount for 1 or 2 months them much much more $. Basically false advertising but nothing you can do about it except avoid them from the beginning.,ExpensiveRx
14,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 14, 2016",15,"When I experienced lipodystrophy on the insulin pump, my endocrinologist prescribed Toujeo pens for my basal insulin and Humalog pens for my mealtime and correction doses of insulin. I have always been somewhat brittle but on the toujeo, I was even more brittle.  My doseage of 16 units of Toujeo was too low but an increase of only one unit of one unit per day caused extremely low blood sugars.  In fact in my almost 40 years of Type 1 Diabetes, the lowest blood glucose readings I ever experienced (25 mg/dl) was while on Toujeo.  I am not a medical professional but I would not recommend Toujeo to anyone.",MommyDoops
15,Toujeo,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 10, 2016",18,"my doctor tried switching me from lantus to toujeo because my blood sugar was always high in the morning.  It started out working to bring my blood sugar levels down, but within four to six weeks, I had gained 10 pounds (and I am not tall), I had swelling, and I could barely feel my toes due to poor circulation.  I have never had problems with circulation that could not be regulated.  I have had type 1 diabeletes without too many complications for 35 years, and am otherwise, healthy.   I had to have my doctor switch me back to Lantus because Toujeo was destroying my body.   I hope this does not replace Lantus or I will not be around for long.",Rlljke
