0,Insulin glargine,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 20, 2022",1,"Semglee (insulin glargine):My awful insurance company stopped covering Lantus on January first, with no warning to me. When I went to pick up Lantus the pharmacist instead gave me Semglee, a totally unknown drug to me.  I did not want to take Semglee. I have many food and drug allergies. I have waited a month to hear from the insurance if they will still allow me to get Lantus because of my allergic reaction concerns upon switching to Semglee. I finally ran out of Lantus today, and tried Semglee. Redness and radiating soreness at injection site, dizzy, feel faint. I took a reduced dose from my Lantus dose out of fear of a bad reaction. That was a good call. I am not taking this again. Will just use (higher doses) Novolog, without a supporting long-lasting insulin. Crappy insurance company changes my Lantus after 20 years of successful use. I hope they are happy with their extra money.",human being

All started when I went to see a doctor in an area I had just moved to.  Without any discussion, or notification, they put me on Basaglar, no change in the number of units that I needed to take.  I was on it for a month before I started to feel my worst.  Then I looked closer at the medication  and realized it was not Lantus which I had been taking for years.  I gained 40 pounds.  I could not sleep in my bed anymore because I couldn't breathe. My feet were swollen drastically.  I could not make it up 13 steps without having to stop multiple times because I could not breathe.  I was a very active person before all of this.After multiple trips to the Dr, and a change in Drs they found that my ejection fraction was 15%, Normal is 55-75%",Ms3177345

I had found it difficult to inject larger amounts (above 30 units) so I began splitting my daily dose. Initially half morning and half night. I was told to raise amounts by 4 units at a time but stick with it for 4 days, same if I need to reduce it. When getting close to the right amount reduce the change but stick to 4 days. This has been useful information and I'm now mostly only changing 1 unit at a time. I eventually worked out that the night time dose was doing nothing for me, so I'm now once per day (still split into two injections). Been pretty good for 3 years now. I did try rapid in the morning dose to try and reduce the ~10a.m. peak but was taken off it as nothing seemed to change it and particularly as I've been following a strict keto diet for about 5 years now. Generally the clinic comment on my good control (by HbA1c). I'm mostly in the range 50-55 units/day.",LADA Type 1

I have diabetes for more than 20 years now, and not once have I experienced a base insulin misbehave so much as the Toujeo SoloStar.The effects range from severe hyperglycemia (> 20 mMol/L) to persistent hypoglycemia (< 3.0 mMol/L).

What is the true downfall of basaglar is the injecting mechanism. For example, tresiba has a mechanism that helps push the insulin out of the pen into your body. Basaglar is completely manual and you must push on the pen forcefully to get the dose out. It may not seem like a big deal but if you have been a diabetic for years you’ll realize that you might need extra help from your pen to push that insulin past all the scar tissue. In closing, the main reason I wrote this was because I just did a dose and no less than 1/4 of the dose was wasted because the pen mechanism is an absolute abomination. Other than that it’s ok",Tony

In my case, Toujeo induced defensive responses, which caused unexplainable high BGs. Eg. went to bed with BG 100 and woke up with BG 270. I thought it was a rebound (Somogyi) effect or excessive DP. When I bought a CGM it revealed that the jumps occur abruptly, with no apparent reason, in the middle of the night or in the afternoon (after 10 - 15 hours from bedtime injection, when Toujeo reaches peak activity). In the final weeks, Toujeo caused me heartburn, accelerated and irregular heatbeat and shaking. My BG was in the range between 200 and 300, and bolus corrections had no lowering effect. In fact, Toujeo increased my BG, which is clear evidence of drug rejection. At the end, went to the ER with BG 450 and received NovoRapid infusion which bought me down to BG 100. Before, I took 25-30 units of Toujeo while now am on 14-16 units of Tresiba. I think I was Toujeo resistant from the very start but things escalated in the last months.",Rinno
