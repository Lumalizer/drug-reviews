My Mom has had type I Diabetes since she was 12 years old.  She is now 70.  She takes good care of herself and has always been vigilant about diet and keeping blood sugars controlled.  She suddenly started having blood sugars in the 200-400 range frequently, for no reason, about 9 months ago.  She has been running an average of 200, which is completely not normal for her. She was told by her doctor it was due to her age and how long she has had Diabetes.  We no longer believe that.  We went through her diaries (yes she keeps food and blood sugar diaries!) and realized--this trouble started when her doctor switched her to Admelog (Lispro) from Humalog.  Insurance company won't cover the Humalog anymore.  We have tried to tell the doctor this to no avail.",Diabetic

I have cut down significantly on carbs, rarely have any fruit, yet I have to take at least 2x the insulin with BG consistently around 200. Previous A1cs were 5.1, 5.3, 5.6, last one jumped to 6.2. The generic is half the cost, but if I double my usage, where is the saving for the insurance company? Big Pharma is awful.

I ended up in the ER each time.   I clicked the number of units I wanted, an hour later, I believe, without proof, that the kwikpen released too much insulin even though I checked the number of units before injecting.

I am a Type 1 diabetic whose diet is extremely healthy (vegan, low sugar, low fat, no alcohol) and who exercises vigorously for 45-60 minutes a day. I only started experiencing high blood sugar at dangerous levels when I switched from the Humalog vial to Humalog Kwikpens for insulin injections. The pens jam, often with almost the entire 300iu left in the barrel. Even worse, after about a week of use, the pens start to leak - more insulin runs down the side of the barrel than gets injected. I never know how much insulin I am getting - and have injected what would be, for me, a huge dose, only to find my blood sugar continues to rise. These pens are frustrating and extremely dangerous. I also use Lantus pens, and they function perfectly with every use. Manufacturer of Humalog Kwikpen needs to do A LOT better!",Reviewer381

8,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 28, 2021",5,"Humalog (insulin lispro):I have used Humalog for 5 years.  My insurance company told me I could no longer use any other insulin.  Why they told me that, only they know.  It appears to be a result of Lily's sales team.  Humalog worked good for a few years.  Last year it suddenly stopped working well.  I suddenly needed TWICE as much insulin for each dose.  I count carbs and use 1 unit of Humalog for every 10 carbs eaten.  Suddenly, my BG was thru the ceiling.  On a guess, I increased my Humalog by 60%, my BG went down considerably.  I increased it more until my BG was back to normal.  You can blame whatever reason you want, but I think Humalog has been altered by Lily.  It just isn't as effective for me, it goes bad twice as fast, it can NOT be allowed to get to room temp. (warmer than 75 F) or it stops working at all.  I stopped using Humalong.  I use Novolog.  Novolog works better, quicker and is more dependable than Lily's altered Humalog.  If Humalog works for you, great.  It is terrible for me.",Truth2021

The Humalog pens constantly leak, even after leaving in the skin for up to 10 seconds after injection, insulin constantly runs out of the needle after you pull the needle out after injection and it of course stinks. There are constantly bubbles in the pen that are often times not removable. I did call Humalog, and they walked through their protocol steps to problem solving, but none of it worked. I'm very curious as to why I never have any of these problems with my Levemir pens. Can the technology be so different, and why can't Humalog work towards that type of superior product?",Anonymous

This insulin is by far the worst I have ever used. It is extremely unpredictable. Right now I cannot get my blood sugar under 400 mg/dL no matter how much of this insulin I take. There are days when I am nonstop low. My endocrinologist knows that this insulin is garbage but my insurance will not switch me no matter what. I've complained to the FDA but it probably fell on deaf ears. I'm not even sure how this was even approved by the FDA considering that there are numerous complaints about it.,Sarah

Not only do I believe the quality/strength of the insulin is not the same, it’s infuriating the pens keep sticking, so one can’t deliver the quantity selected in one jab. I am stopping using the KwikPens right now. I’ve had enough. My sugar controls of the past have been good. I do not want to jeopardise good control by using this substandard equipment.",Barbara

Has worked for all my years on insulin.  It works well.  But, over the last two years  I have had MANY times when I have, for example, 200 BG and I eat 50 units of carbs.  Those numbers tell me I need 2 units of insulin for my BG and 5 units for my carbs = 7.  I usually may add 1 extra unit.  After I do all of that in my example, my BG will be 300???!!!!!   I did exactly what my Dr. has told me to do and what has worked for MANY years.  But, it no longer works with Humalog.

21,Insulin Lispro,Diabetes Type 1,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 1, 2020",2,"I have used Humalog and Novalog interchangebly for years, with great results.  I have NOT tried Sanofi's insulin lispro (Admelog); however,  I recently got a bottle of Eli Lilly's generic insulin lispro.  My blood glucose levels were consistently higher while I was on it.  These levels returned to normal once I started back on Novalog.  This generic lispro was slow on the uptake (more like ""Regular"" insulin), then it is crash and burn about 3.5 hours later, then not much left after that.  I did not feel well on this insulin in a way that was different from the feeling of an elevated blood glucose.  I had some foot swelling as well as tenderness in the region of my kidneys.  I don't believe that I imagined this.  This insulin is certainly better than nothing for an insulin dependent diabetic; however, I wouldn't choose to take it due to the side effects  and I think that more research is definitely warranted.",Ping

This insulin IS NOT THE SAME as Humalog, as the doctor's still try to convince you.

Wait another hour, still haven't ate anything, 10 more points. I have also had my BGL rise while on it. While on Humalog, my BGL drops and regulates within half hour. Admelog will kick in in over 3 hours and give me a very low BGL. This insulin has made me very sick and nauseous!!!
