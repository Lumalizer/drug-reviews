All started when I went to see a doctor in an area I had just moved to.  Without any discussion, or notification, they put me on Basaglar, no change in the number of units that I needed to take.  I was on it for a month before I started to feel my worst.  Then I looked closer at the medication  and realized it was not Lantus which I had been taking for years.  I gained 40 pounds.  I could not sleep in my bed anymore because I couldn't breathe. My feet were swollen drastically.  I could not make it up 13 steps without having to stop multiple times because I could not breathe.  I was a very active person before all of this.After multiple trips to the Dr, and a change in Drs they found that my ejection fraction was 15%, Normal is 55-75%",Ms3177345
1,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 26, 2021",1,"I have been diabetic for 24 years and have used Lantus for about 20 years until my insurance said this winter that it would not cover it. I was changed to Basaglar and told that it was basically the same, but it’s not!!! In 8 months my A1C has jumped to a 10% from a 7-8%. My blood sugar drops really low in the morning without real explanation and then it creeps up to ridiculously high levels no matter what I eat. I am very low carb and I exercise, but nothing helps. I am also unable to lose weight and I feel terrible. This medication is a disgrace!! If you can even call it that. I am glad to see that I’m not alone in having these issues.",Rachel

3,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 2, 2021",2,"My insurance switched me to this insulin and ever since I've been taking it, I have extreme low blood sugars in the middle of the night and one night it got down to 15 and my mom called 911 and other times dropped to 40 and I've never had hypoglycemia to this degree as I've had since taking this medication.  I'm severely depressed and have anxiety which I've never had before.  I also feel sluggish and tired all the time and no energy to do anything.  This is garbage insulin and I need to go back to Lantus which has been working for me for the past 17 years.  I'm very frustrated and feel so defeated by all of this!  Take this off the market!!",Nate
4,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 1,2.0,,"June 27, 2021",1,"Type1 Diabetic for 59 years. I have been on every insulin ever made over the years. Insurance switched me from Lantus, which worked very well for me.  Basaglar is a poorly manufactured product -  constant air bubbles in pens (which require wasted insulin as I tap and release trying to get rid of them.  Have to be careful dialing up doses as it doesn't seem to deliver correct amounts. Have constant lows in the mornings and a strange drop around 10:30 at night.  I have a G-6 which alerts me to this nonsense.I have found that I am developing a bulge on my left thigh. I don't think the insulin is absorbing properly. I had switched to injecting on the left thigh (side).",DiabeticGrandma

6,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 1,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 16, 2021",0,I am a type 1 diabetic who was taking Lantus for years with an average A1C of 6.8 to 7.4. Insurance switched me to Levemir which faded after 20 hours and increased my A1C to the high sevens. Then tried Basaglar in spite of all the bad reviews it got. Well don't believe everything you read! This stuff is even better than Lantus! My A1C dropped from 7.9 to 7.3 the last 3 months which still included about 1 month that I had still been taking Levemir. I feel great! Thank you Lilly!,CTRozek
7,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 18, 2021",3,"I hate this insulin. Because of insurance I was forced to change from the Lantus I was on that worked great. I’ll go to bed with perfect numbers and wake up high. Not just a little high, like in the 300s.

Since he has OHP, the insurance switched from Lantus to this POS because of cost. Every night its a fight to get the correct amount to come out and we don't even know if he is getting the correct dosage because of how the pen is.  The pens need to be fixed, we can't keep guessing if he is getting the correct dosage. And to make things worse, it hurts him even more because of how hard it is to push the button. His numbers have been all over the place because this med doesn't work as good as Lantus.",Katie

12,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 1,3.0,,"August 28, 2020",1,"So I have been on basaglar for 2 months and as far as the effectiveness of the insulin it isn’t the best but it isn’t terrible either. What is the true downfall of basaglar is the injecting mechanism. For example, tresiba has a mechanism that helps push the insulin out of the pen into your body. Basaglar is completely manual and you must push on the pen forcefully to get the dose out. It may not seem like a big deal but if you have been a diabetic for years you’ll realize that you might need extra help from your pen to push that insulin past all the scar tissue. In closing, the main reason I wrote this was because I just did a dose and no less than 1/4 of the dose was wasted because the pen mechanism is an absolute abomination. Other than that it’s ok",Tony

Even though we spend a lot of money for our medicine. The pharmacist did try to make it right. She called the company, and what ever they did. I start  receiving my insulin from the pen. Now this month, same thing as last month. Hard to turn, no insulin will come out. I am a serious type 1. You should not have to do special trick with the pen needle to get insulin out.

My A1C has consistently been around 6.5.  My use of Basaglar has been to set a baseline for 24 hours.  I take the Humalog prior to eating.  My lows can always be traced to not having enough carbs to counteract the insulin.

It causes depression and anxiety. Also takes forever to work. I have to take twice as much and blood sugars are still twice as high . Please take this off the market.

Luckily I decided to not take my usual full dose until I saw how I reacted.  Yesterday I crashed 2x.  Today I cut the morning dose again.  I have crashed and had to eat some fast carbs 3x today.  It has been so erratic that I couldn't use my fast acting insulin with my meals....and have still crashed.  I ate Christmas cracker and crashed...That alone should have sent me well over 200 without fast acting insulin. Sort of scared to go to bed.

26,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,,"August 9, 2019",24,"This med Basaglar is nothing like Lantus. My 12 year old Granddaughter was forced to switch from Lantus to Basaglar 8 months ago. The insurance will not pay for Lantus that she had been using for previous 2 years. Within a week of using we knew this medication was not working and was causing her side effects. Her Day time glucose levels were very high. We had to double her short acting insulin. At night time her levels are dropping to 40 every few hours. The pen injector malfunctions frequently, jams, and I am convinced dispenses incorrect amount of units. I have to wake her up & load her with carbs to get her levels back up 2-4 times each night. If it were not for her Dexcom G6 alarm I honestly think she would die in her sleep. She has headaches, abdominal pain, back pain, and leg cramps daily. She has respiratory issues every since starting the med.",Maddy

Only recently did a biopsy conclude that it began when I began Basaglar.  Other side effects for me are extreme exhaustion and decline in muscle strength.  Instability walking and serious weight gain.  In the past 18 months I have been totally unable to control my blood sugars and it is taking a toll on my health.  I am now having to fight with my insurance company to cover Lantus.  ,Rich
28,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 6, 2019",15,"Not sure if its purely due to basaglar, but ever since I've taken this medication I've been getting respiratory infections after stopping this medication the infections disappeared. I was on antibiotics weeks after weeks so at this point I'm going to blame poor quality of this product. This insulin is just not worth the damage; ""flu like"" symptoms is honestly the best way to explain it. The way the medication is metabolized by the body definitely has an issue somewhere more R&D should've been done. Please Eli Lily this product is very unpredictable compared to other insulins (levemir/lantus/humulin) its most definitely not as aggressive as lantus is. It also seems to not work very well with novolog in my experience its like gambling.",Mmm

I lowered the dose time after time and ate a ton of carbs before bed and I still almost died, however it doesn't lower my sugar later in the day I have to cover my meals with twice the fast acting as I normally would.

He increased the dose, but it did not help.  He has a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), so he's very aware of how things are going.My other son had a different experience -- very inconsistent blood sugar levels.  He had both highs and lows while on Basaglar that were unexplained by other things.  He has a CGM too, so it was pretty clear what happened after the switch. I believe in the FDA process and generics or biosimilars or whatever they're called.  But Basaglar didn't work for us.  Back on Lantus now and back to normal.",Henry

Even still I can't eat a salad with four and a half croutons without my sugar climbing to 300, even with dosing well in advance. This is really blowing my mind, I'm pretty sure it's just water.

I previously used Protaphane insulin as long-acting insulin. Since I used Basaglar insulin my daily usage of both the long- and short-acting (Humalog) insulin has increased dramatically. When I started with Basaglar insulin I have kept it to the similar dosage as I used with the Protaphane insulin but I was shocked that the Basaglar insulin do not worked as the Protaphane insulin. To kept my sugar levels between 6 and 10, I had to almost double my usage with the Basaglar insulin. The Basaglar insulin had a negative impact on my health as I was forced by my medical aid provider to only use Basaglar insulin.

51,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 1,,,"February 7, 2018",6,"My insurance made me switch from Lantus to Basaglar just because Basaglar was a measly 15% cheaper.  It did not work for me AT ALL.  I don't understand how this drug was ever approved for Type 1 Diabetes.  My blood sugar readings went from being predictable into a complete tailspin.  I tried to control it with my fast-acting insulin (Novolog) and not even that worked!  Complete nightmare.  I contacted my doctor's office with blood sugar readings and they put in an emergency authorization request for my Lantus.  The only reason I didn't have to go to the hospital or end up in DKA was Lantus.  Bottom line: if you are a type 1, try it at your own risk and make sure you still have some of your old long-acting insulin for backup just in case.",NicknameAlreadyInUse
52,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 14, 2017",12,"I was on Basaglar for 6 months because of my insurance no longer covering lantus. I had extreme anxiety, nightmares and most scary was the fast heart rate. I am only 37 and have never had a heart problem or had shortness of breath like I did on this horrid medicine. I've been off for about 3 weeks, my heart rate has slowed somewhat but my doctor is now sending me for an EKG. I seriously hope it didn't cause any permanent damage, dealing with type one diabetes is enough! I am getting a TAR to go back on lantus. Please report side effects to the FDA as I did, to get this medicine pulled. Also had red dots where I injected and it did burn. Absolutely scary stuff.",Aimstar01
53,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 1,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 20, 2017",8,"I've been type 1 diabetic for over 50 years.  I've seen lots of changes, most of them an improvement. However, Basaglar is NOT an improvement over Lantus for me. It is supposed to be Bio ""Similar"" (whatever that means) but my experience has not been a good one. Basaglar is unpredictable and has caused me much stress and anxiety because my blood sugar is all over the place and my insurance company has given me no choice. My last Hemoglobin A1c was 7.2 on Lantus. I'm going for blood work today. We'll see. A1c may be decent but my quality of life is not. Constant hypo glycemia at night and adjusting dosage ends up with high BS. I feel terrible!",Good Diabetic
54,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 1,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 13, 2017",6,"My insurance made me switch from Lantus.  I am still trying to gauge how closely 1 unit of basaglar = 1 unit of Lantus, but I have other issues with the pen.  For one thing the numbers are really hard to read.  Lantus numbers were very dark and easy to see.  I also don't like the silence with injection.  It clicked on Lantus and I could hear it was going in.  The worst thing is that with the start of every new pen it hiccups and then engages so I don't get a full dose.  I will start pushing out some of the insulin first and then start over from now on.",RoccoMama
55,Basaglar,Diabetes Type 1,4.0,,"July 14, 2017",14,"Moved from levemir to basaglar as my insurance ""Discovery Medical Aid"" won't cover levemir. Been using basaglar for about 3 weeks now. It's been horrible so far. It appears to peak after 10 hours so that made it unpredictable given how they say it should work. I halved the dose to counter the hypo's but now sugars are higher than usual any other time. I feel out of focus and dizzy.  My chest feels ""fluish"".  I am considering going back to levemir and paying the large copayment.",KennedyM
