0,Insulin,Diabetes Type 1,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 30, 2020",3,"Novolin R (insulin regular):I have been un-insured for about 5 years now. Novolin R has been a life-saver for me. I do not feel that Wal-Mart would open themselves up for suit if they thought the product was inferior. I HAVE TO EAT RIGHT AND NOT POLLUTE  MY BODY. When I act right and take care of myself, my sugar readings stay in check. When I don't, I pay the price no matter what insulin. I highly recommend this product if you are un-insured. $28 a month has saved me.",Petie

2,Insulin,Diabetes Type 1,3.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 17, 2019",6,"Novolin R (insulin regular):Novolin R...have to buy because it is the cheapest without insurance, I believe Humalog R is the best insulin to take, however if is over a $100, while Novolin is 25$. Asked my Dr. for Humalog, will give me however the insurance company won’t pay for it!! They make you get a generic generic insulin Admelog  it is better than Novolin, however not close to Humalog in quality and reliability.......I agree w the first review, Cara, what she stated about novolin kicking in later on I have also experienced. I have had times where it doesn’t seem to absorb!!?",Dan Cooper
3,Insulin,Diabetes Type 1,,,"January 21, 2018",15,"Novolin R (insulin regular):My options were to either pay the $306 for humalog or wait and pay $25 for novolin R.Novolin R in my option is unpredictable and must be used in small increments.It will keep you alive but it will also make you feel slightly like a zombie at first. I believe you get what you pay for and if normally insulin is hundreds of dollars theirsa reason novolin r is sold for $25. Still, I'm grateful for the option until my health insurance clears up.I would just advise people to use extreme caution and not take over 6 units at a time. It takessometimes 3 hours before the insulin even kicks in so be aware if you keep taking more and moreit will have a rubber band effect,,once it kicks in your sure to get low.",Cara12
4,Insulin,Diabetes Type 1,10.0,,"April 14, 2016",4,Humulin R U-500 (Concentrated) (insulin regular):My Diabetes has never been in such good control ever since I started using Humulin R U-500 Insulin. I recently got an insulin pump and this is the insulin that was used. The insurance I have now will not cover any insulin so I had to stop taking Humulin R U-500 due to the fact I cannot afford the out of pocket costs. I am a hard working woman with a good job but because I am not at the poverty level I am unable to get assistance with paying for this insulin. I have been off of this insulin for 2 days and my blood sugars are rising 250-500. I need this insulin and I need help in order to be able to start using it again.,chicken legs
