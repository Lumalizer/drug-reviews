1,Humalog,Diabetes Type 1,4,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 17, 2021",2,I find the pen does not dispense accurately. I have to leave the pen in more time than should be necessary to accommodate for leakage.,66 year insulin
2,Humalog,Diabetes Type 1,1,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 28, 2021",5,"I have used Humalog for 5 years.  My insurance company told me I could no longer use any other insulin.  Why they told me that, only they know.  It appears to be a result of Lily's sales team.  Humalog worked good for a few years.  Last year it suddenly stopped working well.  I suddenly needed TWICE as much insulin for each dose.  I count carbs and use 1 unit of Humalog for every 10 carbs eaten.  Suddenly, my BG was thru the ceiling.  On a guess, I increased my Humalog by 60%, my BG went down considerably.  I increased it more until my BG was back to normal.  You can blame whatever reason you want, but I think Humalog has been altered by Lily.  It just isn't as effective for me, it goes bad twice as fast, it can NOT be allowed to get to room temp. (warmer than 75 F) or it stops working at all.  I stopped using Humalong.  I use Novolog.  Novolog works better, quicker and is more dependable than Lily's altered Humalog.  If Humalog works for you, great.  It is terrible for me.",Truth2021
3,Humalog,Diabetes Type 1,5,,"April 6, 2021",5,"I have been using Humalog for approximately 1 year, in addition to Lantus. It has been working fine, but my complaint is in the pens. I have had 4 pens malfunction over the past year. I understand there are flaws in any item. But, when I called Lily to get replacements for the pens, they flat refused to stand behind their product. I just want to warn everyone who plans or is using this medication that Lily does not stand behind their product and you will be spending extra money in the event you experience a bad pen. These pens can get expensive. Buyer beware!!!",Vic

7,Humalog,Diabetes Type 1,10,,"January 13, 2012",16,I've been using Humalog in my insulin pump for over 10 years. Humalog works well as a basal insulin as well as bolus for highs that may occur due to a variety of circumstances. I've found it very easy to adjust my blood glucose levels using Humalog.,LJS6182
