I never had any of those symptom in the past with Tersiba and as soon as I take it the side effects start appearing. I’m now on other medicine beside this and Nova Rapid.I wish if Tresiba sees my Review and make this drug like it used to be.",Mutasim

2,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,,"May 7, 2021",2,"Hello. I'm from Poland. I took Tresiba in October 2019 my sugars were not too bad. But my sense of well-being was terrible. I had shortness of breath, headache and dizziness, stomach pain on the right side, fatigue, sadness. After 2 months I returned to Levemir. In April 2020, I started to feel terrible, it turned out that I now have celiac disease and histamine intolerance. My doctor looked at me as if I was crazy as I told him that I felt terrible after tresiba. I have the impression that Tresiba led to celiac disease.",Poland Girl
3,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,9.0,,"April 1, 2021",1,Been a diabetic type 1 for 22 years. Been on lispro  my whole life with average a1c of 6.8. My endocrinologist  has recommended tresiba and novo instead. So far I'm finding it to be great for stabilization on blood sugars and I've been exercising and working construction so far I'm loving it.,Grambo
4,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 15, 2021",26,"I don't normally write reviews I am type 1 diabetic and I was on lantus, and then I got put on tresiba. I was so worried cos I have anxiety and read these reviews and you lot made me nervous about taking it. I couldn't get through to my diabetic nurse before taking and anyway it's alright. I had a few side effects that lasted 2 days blurry vision and felt a bit sick, but  that's it and now it's best thing I  have done I like how it gives you freedom on when you can take it and not having to take it same time every day.  Honestly if your on here scared.. DON'T BE. Reading  these comments will make you worse :) smile and breath and you'll be fine..",Michael

It has kept my blood sugars between 100 and 120.  I still have problems with waking highs in the 160s but am still titrating according to my NP instructions.  I use Fiasp for short acting and, these together,  have been a godsend to me.  I am very pleased with Tresiba.  I do have a cgm which makes this sooo much better.",cat

Sometimes they shoot air and not insulin so your blood sugars will be way out of controlI’d like to know what the doctors get for pushing the Tresiba from the companyWhen I told my dr the pens are awful she said she had never heard this from any other patient. So I looked at reviews terrible terrible reviews!!!,JB
9,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,,"September 4, 2020",4,"Started Tresiba Feb 2020 - changed insulin frequently since 1988, no issues so didn't give it any thought. During March to May 2020 I had 3 episodes, I can only describe as severe 'hot flushes'; tingling top to toe, skin on fire, when that passed (30 seconds) I was then nauseous and dizzy, with a cold sweat. Each time this was within 1 min of injecting Tresiba (20 units) and was followed by 4 hours of shivering through the night the same as a fever, then feeling normal the next day. Upsetting and timing wise co-incided with the start of Covid so thought possibly a factor. Found this site and stories from other  type 1 diabetics reporting same. My doc swapped me back to the Lantus I was on previously, no further issues since (5 months now). The doc did say he had 4 other patients who had side effects. Looking back, I did feel more dizzy than usual on Tresiba and frequently felt faint. All sorted now, but we warned!",Timmyboy

I do not know if it is a lot issue or a refrigeration issue during shipping.  I store it in a refrigerator within 5 minutes of picking up the chilled insulin from the pharmacy.   I have NEVER had an issue similar to this with any other insulin including Lente, NPH, Regular, Novolog, Levimeir, Lantus, or Humilog over the last 44 years.",Typeonesince1977
11,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 12, 2020",21,"Worst A1C I’ve ever had with this insulin. Started at 34 units of Toujeo and am now only taking 14 units of Tresiba and still experiencing issues. I’ve been experiencing nighttime drops where I give myself only 1 unit of rapid for 50+ carbs at dinner and my blood sugar falls all night. I’ll go to bed at a very high 20 and wake up 8, so I don’t feel safe going to bed when I’m NOT high. And then during the day my blood sugar rises like crazy and it’s like my fast acting doesn’t work at all during lunch. I’ve also never felt sicker. Have had stomach issues, bloating and cramping and pain that’s made me cry. I got an ultrasound done but they found nothing wrong, but after reading these reviews I’m wondering if it’s the Tresiba, since all these problems started only when I’ve been on it. I’ve had shortness of breath and chest pain and have felt so weak I couldn’t make it across the room. I’m honestly miserable on this insulin.",KK
12,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 9, 2020",37,"This insulin Tresiba made me feel like I was constantly sick.  I gained weight quickly, had heart palpitations, no energy, muscle weakness to the point I couldn't walk more than a few feet.  Always tired - I would fall asleep at 8pm and wake up tired at 7:30am.  Felt like I was injecting poison into my body. I became depressed because my body hurt so bad.  My stomach hurt and it was bloated.  If it wasn't for others posting their symptoms I probably wouldn't have related all my symptoms to my insulin.  I've been diabetic I for over 50 years. As soon as I stopped, it took me 2 days to feel like my old self again.   I will never take this medication EVER again.",Jewels
13,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 28, 2020",14,It an ok insulin for sugar control and to each their own. I had a problem with higher morning numbers than when on Levimeir but it did work more through the daytime hours than Levimeir. My main problem was not being able to sleep through out the night due to CONSTANTLY URINATING ( more than 4-5 times a night!! ) even though my numbers were well within range. My doctor said it couldn't be Tresiba causing this but literally the first night I switched back to Levimeir I only used the bathroom once thru the night and that was even with waking up to a bg of 192! I also had the usual stuff like major weight gain and brain fog. I would honestly never use it again.,Tpang85
14,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,2.0,,"February 8, 2020",19,"Started this drug Tresiba a couple of weeks ago and it’s been a horrible experience. I noticed my vision became blurry, I felt like I had the flu. I experienced chills, hot flashes, I felt real light headed. My sugars were stable through out the day so that was great. But then all through the night starting at about 2am, my sugars would just plummet.  Needless to say I haven’t much sleep and probably gained a few pounds trying to keep that sugar up. My doctor swears it doesn’t peak but I’m not so sure about that. I kept lowering my dose but they would still fall around the same time at night, and my day sugars became more elevated. I felt plain awful on this drug and it needs to go back to the drawing board. Very bad formulary. I switched back to my levemir and feel much better. I’m disappointed because it supposed to be a dream Insulin but it was nothing short of a nightmare. My doctor suggested I switch to Tojeao but feel apprehensive.",Krames01
15,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 17, 2020",25,"In the beginning this  Tresiba insulin was a miracle. It came with stable glucose levels but after a couple of years . I became aware about its side effects. Notice that I had a constant flu like symptom, the bolus insulin didn't kick in as it did before, it was like Russian roulette.Tried Lantus in November and there is no doubt that Tresiba has some nasty side effects beside the flu. Lethargy, depression, water retention, itchy skin, and a feeling of a lump in the throat. Tried it again this last week and all these side effects came back within two days. The flu like symptoms kicks in about 3 hours after injection.Regret I tried it, because after some years off the Lantus it seems the body has developed anti bodies and the Lantus now have some side effects as well. Will get off this medicine tomorrow and try Lantus again and hopefully the depression and flu-like  symptoms will subside again.",Ariman
16,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 14, 2019",20,"After 5 months of Tresiba using with good results, the situation change dramatically. The glucose levels start to have slowly growing trend, particularly in the periods of nights and before noons where usually Tresiba should be highly active. Additionally, my blood pressure was unusual terrible, up to 170/100. I had never before such pressures. My normal pressures were around 120/70. Moreover, long time terrible stomachache. I decided to return to old Lantus. Just the first day after this change, the glucose levels, blood pressure and my stomach return to the norm. I am aware that these are individual reactions. However in the case of such or similar problems, remember - this is horrible side effect of Tresiba.",Pawel
17,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,,"November 30, 2019",21,The Tresiba is Horrible stuff. Will stick in your system and bounce your sugar levels to the extremes. Very volatile. Surges with constant low sugars then shoot up then bottom out again. The advantage of taking one shot reminisces by having to check your sugar level every hour. Whatever you do don’t take it at night if you don’t want to wake up in the hospital.,Rob

19,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 11, 2019",19,"Started taking this a few months ago, took a couple weeks for it to start working. I take novolog for meals. Taking my novolog with this has been wildly inconsistent. I used to take Levemir/Lantus and it never affected my rapid acting insulin like this does. It almost feels like it’s time released because sometimes it doesn’t do anything and sometimes it does too much. Had an episode when I had to eat and drink orange juice for 2 hours waiting for my sugar to go back up after a low.",Keenan
20,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 19, 2019",32,"I am in my 30s and have been a type 1 diabetic for 14 years. I have been using Lantus for +10 years, recently my Endo suggested I try Tresiba.  The first few days my glucose levels kept spiking overnight to 19+, it took about a week to figure out dosing (which turned out to the same as Lantus, not less). I was exhausted for the first few days. This insulin does work well, if you miss a meal you will without doubt have a sugar low. After about 2 months, my findings are that I often had a nauseous, car-sick feeling, stomach pain and cramps in upper abdomen were common, almost a water on the brain/plugged ear feeling. It was time to get more Tresiba but I decided to just use lantus that I still had left. I would say immediately the next day after switching back to Lantus I felt normal again. The stomach pain is gone, I don’t feel dizzy or nauseous, my sugars have been stable and easy to control.  Be all end all, Tresiba is worth a trial, but it was not for me.",IslaMyLove
21,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 10, 2019",13,"I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes two years ago at 36 years old. Recently I switch from levemir to tresiba as recommended by my endo to see if my lows will minimize during physical activity and keep me level. Unfortunately, my sugars stayed somewhat high 200-250mg/dL for the two months I was on Tresiba and I developed a rash in my lower back that was gradually getting worst. My endo said she never encounter anyone with a rash not at the injection site but if I felt more comfortable then to switch back to Levemir. I also developed this dry, white patches in my skin. Again my endo wouldn't say it was related to Tresiba but adviced me to go to a dermatologist. I was then told it was lichen sclerosis. I also gained weight on Tresiba.Doctors should be more aware of perhaps lesser known side effects. It seems as though they are completely clueless.Good luck everyone on managing your disease.",Sky

23,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 25, 2019",14,"Right before the 4th of July, my Endo had me try the Tresiba insulin. I had been on fast acting prior because of the pumps, so I had nothing to compare this with in terms on results.  Tresiba worked very well on getting my sugars in range, and I even had several nights of perfect 117 sugars throughout. This insulin is a poor mans pump - however!...However, I  experienced all the worst symptoms like headaches, foggy brains flu/cold like symptoms (honestly, I attributed it to my running around like a 20 years old at age 30) but then the swollen ankles came. Swollen, tender and my skin started feeling on fire. After I realized this was all from my insulin - I called my doctors office and told them to switch me off immediately. Which they did and I switched to Levemir. Here's to hoping it works well. With my review and reading others - I am convinced the Tresiba needs to e assigned to type 2's only because they seem to have better luck then type 1's are on this brand.",Goldie Locks

My diabetic doctor denied that there could be any link and were adamant that I should remain on Tresiba. Six weeks ago I stopped Tresiba and put myself back on  Lantus. My symptoms immediately abated and today, the dermatologist told me that I seem clear.

Have also developed lichen sclerosis and parathyroid problems since starting. My diabetes team has been extremely resistant to me returning  to lantus  which I was using before and insisted that tresiba does not cause any problems. I have now taken the initiative to return to lantus on my own and I actually feel ‘clear’ again. I’m very disappointed in my health professionals in this case.

26,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 5, 2019",33,"This insulin is horrible. I've been a type 1, diagnosed as an adult, for 10 years. I was told, as many it seems, this is the best new insulin...I just try it. I've been trying it now for months.  My sugars are sky high, sky high during the day, lows in middle of the night. How is this a flat, stable insulin. I too just unbearable tired, like I'm on sleeping pills or something, and nauseous too since starting this. I don't know if it's because my BG's are so messed up from this insulin or if it's the insulin. I've tried it, titrated dose. I'm very tiny and use very little insulin, only about 6 units basal per day. But this stuff, dry mouth, more weight loss but I too got really swollen ankles, feeling very tight. It's the worst insulin I've ever tried. I don't believe the positive comments are from real patients...I believe they're fake from Tresiba Reps. This is horrible stuff..worst BG control ever and I have A1C's typically in the 6's. since on this gone up to 8s.",PetiteType1
27,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 18, 2019",8,51 years a type 1 diabetic.  Currently using Tresiba and Humalog.  Since beginning Tresiba 1 month ago (over RELION NPH) I have reduced daily blood sugar swings consistently. The daily Humalog (formerly RELION REGULAR) is only a VERY FEW units - morning basal is 13 units (at 5 am) and evening basal is 10-12 units (at 5-6 pm). I use Dexcom g6 and a1c is 5.0 currently.  Purchasing Tresiba CHEAPER or more AFFORDABLY would be nice - this takes a good deal of my income and this is the only thing really discouraging about this wonderful insulin.,ben

I was very excited to try it! I’ve been using it for about 4 weeks with terrible results. I feel like I have no long acting insulin in my body. My glucose readings are all over the place and if I go to bed with levels of6-8, I was wake up they are 18 - 20. This means I start my day in a terrible mood and feeling horrible. I started at 20 units and now at 28 units daily with no difference. I have an appointment soon and going to ask if I can just go back to Lantus or Toujeo. My glucose got so high one day that it was off the chart and couldn’t give a number, just said high. Very disappointed and do not recommend this product!!",Dadwithtype1

30,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,,"December 30, 2018",24,"My Endo gave me samples of Tresiba to try, and I used it for a little over a month.  Adverse symptoms included dense brain fog, feeling like I had the flu for weeks on end, and one brief/mild episode of hives on day 12 that benadryl knocked out, and they didn't return.  My biggest complaint was the incredibly volatile sugar  levels.  I use a Dexcom, and it was sending out fast rise/drop alarms 2-3 times an hour - up, up, down, up, down, down.  It was  exhausting.  Endo adjusted the dose several times (3 days between each switch), but nothing helped.  One thing I didn't try was splitting the dose over 12 hours, but have read where others have had some success with that.  I just couldn't get level, even after 2 days of going completely carb free.  I went back to Levemir and within 12 hours felt most symptoms alleviate, and in 24 hours, was back to 100%.I'm really glad I had the chance to try it, but may be allergic to it, so won't be going back.",Cee
31,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 4, 2018",16,"I’ve been on tresiba for just under a week (made the switch from levemir) and have mixed feelings. Although it’s still early days in terms of fine tuning the dose, I feel like it would probably be a great option in terms of enabling more consistent and lower blood glucose levels. HOWEVER, since day 3 I have felt absolutely dreadful. I have had chronic diarrhoea, that just doesn’t seem to go away. Awful agony stomach pains. I’ve felt exhausted, far beyond what I’ve ever felt before. To the point where I feel like I could sleep 24/7. And I’ve felt breath-less for no reason also. I really want tresiba to be a viable option for me, but unfortunately it looks like it’s the most likely cause of these symptoms. So I’ll be on the phone to my diabetes team tomorrow, looks like another switch will be necessary. Just hoping I’ll start to feel remotely normal soon!!",Izzy
32,Tresiba,Diabetes Type 1,9.0,,"October 24, 2018",19,It's been a month now using Tresiba and I'm amazed at my results. Especially my overnight blood sugars.I utilize a Freestyle Libre flash blood glucose monitor and when I test in the middle of the night when I go to the washroom and then again when I wake up I can see that the graph is consistently flat throughout the night.I was on twice a day Lantus prior to this and my FGM would show me spiking at around 3am night after night. Not so with Tresiba.After 45 years of being a type 1 diab I am very happy that I decided to try this...so far.BTW the flash glucose monitoring I highly recommend too. My HgA1c went from 7.8 - 6.8 in just over 6 months b/c I can test as much as I want and know exactly what's happening all the time.

My endo recommended the switch to Tresiba because it was the poor man’s pump nearly two years ago.  I was made to believe I was ill in other ways (PCP and many test that were negative). My stomach hasn’t been right in two years. I watch my caloric intake like a hawk! I have gained weight, lost energy, and felt sicker than I have ever felt. I went from running half marathons to walking a few miles per week...this is THE connection. I appreciate those that validate your response to this medication.

I have had T1D (type 1 diabetes) for over 4 years now and NEVER have I had so much trouble with my blood sugars. I have very good control (A1Cs range from 5.4-6.1, average blood sugar around 115-120 mg/dL), and while on this insulin my average was 148 mg/dL. I woke up low every morning, I'd lower the dose, then wake up high every morning. I started dreading meals because I knew I would have either an extreme low or extreme high afterward. I lost so many hours of sleep staying up trying to stabilize my blood sugar.  I switched back to Lantus yesterday and already my blood sugars today have been 125 and 103 mg/dL today.

I started it last year and my sugars have been amazing, especially the last few months. Went from 9 something to 7.2 and bet I'd still be or even in the 6's as of last month. Why am I conflicted? I've had debilitating stomach cramping, chronic diarrhea and nausea and other awful chronic problems (I noticed other people mentioned headaches and colds and I had those  too). Been to Drs and everything comes back 'normal'. Despite my sugars, I am  a wreck now, I realized the ONLY thing I've changed in my lifestyle is the Tresiba. I'm going on a week off it and don't know for certain yet, since my symptoms come and go (1 day I'm fine and next they're back) but I'm going to try to stick it out and see.As far as blood sugar control, I've woken up in the 3 and 400'sI'm when  off of it.

A BIG  problem on this insulin was I gained about 15 pounds on it.  The most frustrating part for me was that my legs felt really REALLY SWOLLEN all the time.  They were very tight and uncomfortable.  It was as if the weight I had put on had gone to mostly my legs.  I spoke with my doctor and she said that was a very common side effect on Tresiba due to it being a super long acting insulin. She also said I wasn’t the only patient who had complained of that.  Anyways, I went off of it and went back on Levemir insulin.  Levemir never made me gain weight and never made my legs feel tight.  I just felt like I needed to give Tresiba a chance because it was new.  If you’re reading this I hope it works for you - I couldn’t handle the side effects.",Nomie84

Tried it for a week and went back to Lantus. I was getting awful body pains and headaches, and then I found out my initial problems were because my Lantus dose was too high (I switched doctors at that point).

After a week, I seemed to have stomach issues and nausea for days, and then I had headaches and blurred vision and felt like a trainwreck.  After 2 weeks of symptoms, I began to wonder whether I even had the flu.  After 3 weeks of symptoms, I decided to read the medical insert thoroughly, only to discover that these flu symptoms, blurred vision and dizziness, and stomach issues were all SIDE EFFECTS.  I called the endo office and spoke with a doctor on call, who agreed that maybe I should just switch back to Lantus and see how I felt.  I took Lantus that evening and felt better within 12-24 hours.  My endo never called me back, so I won't see him again.  Maybe he gets kick-backs to market this.",PA-Cat

Thought I should only reduce 2 units. But yesterday was scary... for the first time in my life I woke up feeling the sugar levels too high. Ended up in the ER where I was informed I nearly had 700. I thought the batch of pens could be faulty so I bought another batch and started my day . I had 95 when I left the ER and after a day at home sleeping I'm already in 200.

I’m also a medical student and like to tinker with my prescriptions when I learn new stuff. So, I had high hopes when I learned about degludec and talked to my endo about it. Unfortunately, Tresiba just didn’t work for me – it caused wild swings in my daily sugars, almost as if it made me more sensitive to my rapid acting insulin (which doesn’t physiologically make sense, I know). For 3 1/2 weeks I tried all sorts of different things to get a handle on it, but the final straw was when I had to ask a quiz proctor for an excuse to go buy juice because I’d eaten all my glucose tablets (something I’ve never had to do in my life). Maybe with more time it would’ve calmed down, but I was so frustrated after the quiz incident that I immediately switched back to Lantus - and my sugars normalized immediately.

I have used virtually every insulin available as well as various insulin pumps over the many years I have been dealing with diabetes. None of the long acting insulins I have ever taken has behaved so well as far as keeping blood sugar stable while fasting. I now have to question whether I ever had dawn phenomenon since I no longer seem to have any rise in blood sugar in the morning. My guess is that we all have different responses to the different insulins. For me this is a game changer. Best I have felt in many years. Keep in mind that it for me it took about a week to see good results and I adjusted the dose in the second week as well. Hope more people have same experience.,Odffh
