0,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 1,1,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 28, 2021",1,"Any fast acting pen that fails to act even one time is a total loss.  This Novolog pen fails to inject sometimes.  So I rate it 1/10.  What happens is: you put the flex pen on and click it into place, and then whatever amount you dial does NOT infuse after injection.  So even though it works well when it works, not working even once when you absolutely need it makes it a terrible device.",Anonymous
1,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 1,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 14, 2021",1,"I was diagnosed with diabetes in 1994.  Began using Novolog.  It worked great.  Years later, my insurance told me I could no longer use Novolog, it was ""premium"".  I would have to pay 2x as much for it.  They told me I had to use Humalog to get the same Rx co-pay. Aren't ins. companies great (for themselves)? I used Humalog for years and it worked well.  Lately, in the last two years, my blood sugars (BS) went thru the roof and I had no idea why.  On a guess, I doubled my Humalog and my BS came back down.  Now, using twice as much each dose, my BS are ok.  Recently, I had a chance to use Novolog again.  Great!!!  No double dose and it starts working 20 minutes faster than Humalog.  Lily will no longer be conning me with their prices.  I am no longer using their ineffective and overpriced junk.  Thanks Novolog.  It is good to use an insulin that works.",Truth2021
2,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 1,1,,"January 9, 2021",4,"This insulin is terrible. My boyfriend almost died today because he took the normal amount of insulin and it was too much for his body and his sugar dropped to 26. When your sugar is that low it can cause fatal symptoms including passing out, disorientation, memory loss, seizures and even death. My boyfriend ending up an hour away in the middle of nowhere and he was lost. He was passed out and almost died it was lucky his parents found him. SWITCH brands this insulin is too strong and has too many side effects. My bf got lucky today maybe he won’t next time....",Hets
3,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 1,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 2, 2019",4,"I have used humalog, and novalog. They both work the same for me. Right now I don't have insurance so I get a insulin at Walmart called novalin R. It only cost $27.37 and it works great.",Anonymous
4,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 1,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 29, 2019",4,I have been a diabetic since I was 9 months old and still continue to use Novalog to this day and have never had any problems with the medication.,DiabeticGod
5,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 1,1,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 15, 2018",2,The insulin works but they leak and come apart inside and are HORRIBLE inaccurate because they leak and get air in them be very careful I rarely use them because of problems. A syringe is way more accurate because they don't fall apart get air in them  like the other cheap ones,Jjok72
6,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 1,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 11, 2018",1,"Hello,Novolog has worked for me so far.  It does increase my appetite though.  I got a sample from my doctor's office to begin.  I then went to the pharmacy to fill my prescription and found that it costs over $500.00.  I did find a discount RX card on Novonordisk´s website, but it states that you, ""may pay as little as $25.00.""  I read the fine print and it states, ""reimbursement $100 per prescription.""  Has anyone here ever used it?  I had to find a card so I could afford my Lantus as well.  I would just like to know what to expect.  If it's $25.00 or only up to $100 per rx of what they cover.  I'm newly diagnosed, and I would appreciate any help.",Agatefairy
7,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 1,2,,"February 6, 2017",4,"The medicine works fine, but it is in the absolute worst delivery system ever.  I can't imagine an elderly person or someone with arthritis trying to use this pen.",GlenA.
8,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 1,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 18, 2015",9,"I was put on Novolog when I was diagnosed with Type 1 and have loved it ever since. I've never had any negative side effects and when coupled with the Omnipod it is phenomenal for me.It is important to note however that every person's body is different. My doctor recently had me try Humalog to which I had multiple negative side effects. This does not mean one is better than the other, just that for my own body the Novolog happens to be what it accepts and works with best. You should always tell your doctor how ANY medication makes you feel if you experience negative side effects. For me, the Novolog is a gods send and I love it :)",Maerlias
9,NovoLog,Diabetes Type 1,8,,"February 20, 2010",23,"Novolog works very well and very fast (3-5) hours in lowering sugar levels but for those w/out insurance be wary Novolog is very expensive, espicially when you have to couple the insulin w/ another slow-acting, such as Lantus. Together these are very effective however.",Scallywag
