0,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 13, 2021",8,"I’ve been on spironolactone for over two weeks now and I absolutely love it! My endocrinologist had put me on it due to my acne and unwanted hair that grew all over due to my PCOS. At 25mg two pills a day, It has been a total and 100% life saver! I actually have the greatest confidence level now and it also helps with high blood pressure! It runs in both of my parents sides and knowing this helps, it’s  just an added bonus! I could not be happier with this selection! I know everyone is different and reacts differently to medicines, but this has been a total game changer for me. Especially being 30 years old! I don’t feel much dizziness or drowsiness, however diarrhea does come and go. But nonetheless, I’d recommend this to anyone who is experiencing horrible acne.",D
1,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,7.0,,"January 8, 2021",9,"I had taken spironolactone(100mg) for 6 months before 5 years ago for hirsutism. I got some positive result for hirsutism but didn’t get much of it's side effects. For a few months I have noticed that my facial hair growth again increased and I'm also experienced irregular period. So I again took it 15 days ago. But this time I am experiencing huge amount of side effects. Like, trouble in breathing, diarrhoea, bad mood swing, feeling uneasy to walk, abdominal pain, headache, vibration on the parts of the body! I knew that it was the only effective medication for hirsutism. But this time my body doesn’t adjust with it. So, I'm feeling so worried about it. Because this situation with excess facial hair is finishing me!!After all I'm agreeing that its really an effective medication for PCOS with hirsutism.",Monika

4,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,9.0,,"October 5, 2020",22,"I have PCOS and have suffered from coarse facial and body hair for years. I recently started noticing male-pattern baldness around my temples and knew this was a hormonal problem, as I was tested for high testosterone. I started noticing results within days of taking the spironolactone, way sooner than I thought I would. Within a week I was only having to shave my face every other day rather rather than every day, then every three days. My hairline has stopped receding and is slowly growing back. It's only been three weeks and I'm already so happy with the results.I have only had minor side effects. The only one that bothers me at all is breast tenderness. I had some hot flashes the first week but they went away quickly. Sometimes I'm a little nauseous or headachy, but only if I don't drink enough water. Since this is a diuretic, you need to stay on top of your water consumption and try to drink as much as you can every day.",Cam

I rarely get that fuzzy feeling, like when you have low blood sugar; only if I'm dehydrated or get up fast. I already drank a lot of water, so haven't noticed a change in my water intake or need to use the bathroom.Buuuuut I also haven't seen any benefits yet! My body hair is the same, facial hair is the same, skin the same.Not sure if I'm going to go on 200mg or go off of it. I'll update at a later date with anything new.",Cara

My last resort was Spironolactone. The first week or so it definitely made me dizzy, especially when getting up etc. I’ve been on this tablet for 3 and a half months now and I can 100% see a difference. My once black facial hair is almost blonde now. I am on an 800cal diet and have lost 3 stone since starting this (was 17stone). I believe the weight loss and the medication is helping this. I am really happy to be honest.",Danielle
7,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 3, 2020",21,"Awful. Just awful for me. I have a mental illness called borderline personality disorder which causes me to have extremely poor mood regulation and intense bouts of anger to the point of boiling rage. The spironolactone exacerbated this tenfold until I was blowing up at people every single day over the dumbest little things. It got to the point where I almost had to go back inpatient for my mental problems. It was absolute nightmare for the couple weeks that I took it, and if you have any mental health diagnoses, I would urge you to think twice about spirolactone, or at least monitor yourself and your moods verrrry carefully. Depression also got a little worse. Oh, and I guess only two weeks of taking it isn’t long enough to tell if it worked for hirsutism and my hormonal acne, but so far, it didn’t do much.",Candychan

I have spent thousands on Lazer, electrolysis, medicines and it’s worse now more than ever. Just started on Spironolactone  (1 month) and it’s worse instead of better. I was on 1000mg of metformin but I thought this drug would be better. I have other autoimmune illnesses that I take meds for. I was so hoping this would help! I’m so disappointed. The mood swings and more hair growth is awful. I hate to give up only after one month but I don’t think it’s going to work for me.",Sjc

A few month ago my Dermatology prescribed Spironolactone 100mg.  This time I'm using a different pharmacy and the pills have a minty taste and smell compared to  the one from my previous pharmacy 2 years ago.  I decided to stop taking them again this time because I'm staring to get headaches again and my hair is thinner than before, causing my hair to break easily. So now that I stop taking Spironolactone I'm losing my hair like CRAZY. I don't now why this is happening and if it will stop eventually. Just beware of this side effects.",Juli
13,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,2.0,,"August 18, 2019",20,"Be very careful of spirolactone if you have any history of depression, anxiety, or just general stress. Before I started taking spirolacton for PCOS-related hirsutism I had a tendency towards stress and mild anxiety but never a disorder - soon after I started on it my anxiety increased to a level I had never experienced before, and I had my first panic attack while just walking down the street and began having panic attacks almost daily. I had a feeling that this new anxiety was linked to starting this medication and a few months ago I found a study online in a medical journal that found that a single dose of spiro increases the release of cortisol (the stress hormone that floods your brain to cause panic attacks) by 100% within an hour of taking it. I immediately stopped taking the medication and since then I feel much better but still I am left with lasting daily anxiety. I wish I had been warned about spiro's effects on cortisol levels because I would have never started taking it.",mb8658

I can say when I was in my doctor’s office one week ago I had a full lady beard. And usually if I pluck it, it will grow full one week later. So its been one week on Spironolactone  later and I had nothing but little stubbles here and there. I can’t believe no one told me about this medicine before for facial hair. I’m actually impressed.",Jenevieve
15,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 27, 2019",7,"I have PCOS with all the classic symptoms. I see spiro as the a awful drug, the side effects are too much. When I was taking it along with other b/c pills, it helped lower my testosterone level and hair growth but the excessive peeing (will the time), excessive fatigue and mood swings it gave me was too much. I had to stop it. And all the symptoms came right back, even the acne it cured. I feel sad because it works but I'm so scared of going back to it even though I have a reduced dosage now, I still haven't talked myself into taking the pills again. Maybe it effects me so bad because I'm African. May  it doesn't suit Africans. I wish it would just work for me without all the side effects.",Cindy

18,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 3, 2018",41,I started to get hairs on my face and kneck when I turned 24 years old.  After that it just got worse to the point of having a full beard. Very embarrassing. I did lazer hair removal which didn't help since they didn't know what was causing the growth. I have been taking 100mg of spirolactane twice a day now for around a year. There are less hairs my leg armpit hairs etc. Grow at a normal rate now. I still have a fair amount of unwanted hair but it is fine and blonde now rather than course and black. I can grow my chin hairs out to wax them without people staring at me like I'm a mutant now so that's a plus.

I can say that my chin hairs, though still dark, are not nearly as many and they are definitely not as course as they were. I’m kinda small so my doctor will not up my dosage from 50mg a day because I get dizzy really easily and I actually thank her for having the foresight to know that. At 37 years old I have had this condition a really long time so it would be foolish for me to think that it should go away in a short amount of time. I would say to those still waiting, give it time. Also, I was seeing a substantial amount of results until I starting getting my face waxed, then noticed my hair growing back and quickly. Then I was told this week by a waxer at European wax center that some of these wax shops (including them) use a growth serum after waxing (so that their customers will come back), she was sure that my previous waxers probably were using the serum on me (for a whole year!).

Not only has spironolactone not helped, my hirsutism has continued to get worse.Also, my aldosterone (LCMS, serum) was 9.3 before starting spironolactone.

This will look strange and dark but it cancels out the dark patches in your skin. Then cover the orange concealer with a full coverage concealer or foundation (dermacol is amazing!) ... make sure to set it with a powder.

41,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,3.0,,"August 15, 2016",24,"I was prescribed this for both hair and acne on my face and chin, and it helped only very minimally. I was on it for several months at a 100mg, then upped to 200 mg dose per day. The hair did eventually start to lessen in re-growth, but the acne was just the same. The side effects, however, were completely not worth continuing. I little heartburn, and excess peeing, I can deal with, but I was getting my period every 12-14 days! Not just spotting, but the full deal!. Not thank you!! and that wasn't mentioned anywhere as a possible side effect, so... not thrilled.",ally k
42,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,1.0,,"July 27, 2016",24,"Been on Spironolactone for a month 50 mg x 2 daily, for excess facial (chin) hair, with bonus acne clearing up I'm told. My results so far no improvement on hair. I'm trying not to give up but I have gained weight. My legs, mostly upper thighs, are getting bigger too quickly to be me just gaining a few pounds. I can deal with fuller breasts just not the rest of me. My dermatologist said she never heard of this and try and stick it out 3 months at least, but I see online others experienced weight gain too, shocked she dismissed so quickly.  I'll do a couple more months to see if hair improvement. Plucking and shaving everyday gets old, just don't want to get any bigger in the meantime. So far, peeing yes, fuller yes, heartburn yes, hair yes.",TBred
43,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,7.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 22, 2015",49,"I've been on this drug for about 2 years and I really like it! Results vary for different people, but for me it's made the hair on my body grow in finer, lighter, and *much* slower. It's not a miracle pill for me (I still have hirsutism), but it's made me 1000x more comfortable in my body. I never had hirsutism on my face, so I don't have any comments about that... In any case, this drug takes a looong time to kick in (6  months for me), but I definitely recommend it!",happywithspiro
44,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,9.0,,"August 25, 2015",83,"I've been taking this drug for about a month now.  I suffer from PCOS and get very dark coarse hair on my chin and neck.  I have noticed a difference in the hair for sure.  It is lighter and finer, which is great because I was getting tons of ingrowns.The only side effect I have had issues with is the fact that this is a diuretic, so I have to pee constantly.",Bella783
45,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 16, 2015",96,"I was given this prescription originally for acne, but haven't seen much effect there yet... However, it has done wonders for my body hair! I had a super-thick (and spreading) happy trail on my stomach, as well as more sparse chest hair. I've only been on Spiro for about 3 weeks, but the results are incredible! The hair is almost invisible, so I'm thrilled to see what it looks like after all the pre-medication razor burn and ingrown hair cuts are healed.I'll still be buying a Tria laser to make sure I get rid of as much hair as possible, but the hair is already visibly thinner, and it takes much longer to grow back as well. I wore a v-neck for the first time with confidence yesterday!Also- I've had NO side effects from this drug!",Dosage: 100mg per day (2x50mg)
46,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,,,"July 23, 2015",97,I started getting facial hair probably 10 yrs ago. I'm 36 now. I am so embarrassed and it's getting worse. I find myself not going out as much and avoiding as much eye contact as I can. My Dr prescribed spironolactone  over a year ago and it has not helped. She has increased it & that hasn't helped either. My left side by my chin has a dark spot from me constantly plucking the black coarse hairs. I see friends and family looking at it and I'm so uncomfortable that I just want to go home and hide. I have had labs done multiple times to check my hormone levels and it all comes back just fine. I need suggestions on another medication to try and a very good concealer to help hide my problem area. I would appreciate any advice.,Lola29
47,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 18, 2015",51,I've been on this for barely a week for excessive hair growth on my neck and face. Only side affect present so far is the drowsiness. Barely within an hour and I'm ready to sleep. Only problem is it makes me sleep for a quantity of 5 to 12 hours. Definitely a night time medication.,VicPar
48,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,7.0,,"December 21, 2014",39,"I was prescribed Aldactone 100mg for facial hair. At first I had side effects of discomfort in my stomach however I persisted and it stopped. This medication works, it's slows down the hair growth however the side effects out way the results. Irregular periods, heavy bleeding, constipation, feet swelling, appetite and stomach pain, the list goes on. Even though I have reduced the dose from 100, to 75 and further to 50 I will be getting off this.",CarissaA

My acne has gotten a little better, and I no longer have hair on my chin. I still have some hair on my abdomen and thighs, but I've only been on spironolactone for six months.

50,Spironolactone,Hirsutism,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 18, 2012",163,"I have been using this medicine for about 1 month my doctor gave it to me for excessive facial hair. Since I have been taking it. I have noticed the hair grows slower and is lighter and not as course as before but be patient it takes a little while to see results and I believe it will get better with continued use. I did not experience ill side effects with it, in fact I also suffer from adult acne & have tried everything I could find to treat and nothing worked, but I have had no new breakouts after a month and I am just thrilled with the results I am getting. I would recommend it to anyone with facial hair problems!",Anonymous

I used to bleach my facial hair regularly and had dark hair on my arms.  Now the fine hair on my face is blonde and hardly noticable and the arm hair is very light and thinner.,Anonymous
