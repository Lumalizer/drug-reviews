1,Aldactone,Hirsutism,9,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2018",52,"I was diagnosed with  2 years ago with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)and was prescribed aldactone 50mg and metformin 500mg two times a day. Was never regular in taking the medicine. Skipped it for months in a row. Problem started 5-6 months back when my body hair, side burns, upper lip and chin hair started increasing. Last month I plucked out almost 80 really thick hair out of my chin and I had a stupid five o clock shadow on my upper lip after shaving. I was desperate and started taking the meds properly.  Trust me people it's not even a month and the thickness of unwanted hair became half and grows really slow.  All you have to do is have faith and never miss a tablet. It really  can do wonders in your life.",Spe
