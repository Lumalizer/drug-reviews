0,Nifedipine,Hypertensive Emergency,3,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 9, 2021",2,I was recently taken off of nifedipine because of the rare side effects I experienced! I thought I had a pulmonary embolism or an impending heart attack! I felt terrible I was on it for postpartum preeclampsia and felt worst taking it. Even though it helped control my bp I had to stop it.,Nightmare
1,Nifedipine,Hypertensive Emergency,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2021",7,"OMG this is the worst meds to take for Hypertension during pregnancy ! I was given this after I lost my first twin and they kept adjusting it. A week later after the adjustments, my baby died at 28 weeks.  Had to deliver naturally. Next pregnancy, all was good until Christmas. I was past 30 weeks and my ob said I needed it to control my bp. I needed for another option but they said this was the best and ok to use in pregnancy.  At 38 weeks, I went into natural labor and my baby died. Baby was perfectly healthy before the medicine and then I was given the medicine and she died. Please please please don’t take this medicine if you are pregnant!!!!!   I now lost 3 babies from preeclampsia/hypertension and nifedipine!",Audrey
2,Nifedipine,Hypertensive Emergency,3,,"February 4, 2021",3,"I had a left basal ganglia stroke due hypertension. My B/P was 220/125.  I was 49 at the time.  Upon discharge from the hospital & God’s hand, I was able to go home with minimal effects  I began taking Procardia Er following the stroke & had multiple  trips to the ER  with severe symptoms of heart palpitations, extreme dizziness,  excessive weight gain & swelling, shooting electrical like pains in my arms, joint pain, severe anxiety, random confusion, fuzzy feeling in the back of my head.   I was told by the ER, just a headache...need to wait and see what the full effects of your stroke will be... I waited and lived like this, never knowing which day would be a horrible day of symptoms. Finally realized the first hour of getting up in the morning before I took the med, I felt normal with symptoms starting about 45 minutes after taking it. I know I have no choice but to take some type of but this medication has horrible side effects  I still have issues with B/P and even this  med",Riley
