0,Hydralazine,Hypertensive Emergency,2,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 19, 2022",0,"Second time on this drug. Had a hypertension crisis. They gave to me at hospital. Called cardiologist the following morning and guess what, he put me on this AGAIN, three times a day along with losartan and carvedilol. OMG. I have horrible headaches that get worse the more I take. It took me a month to level out enough to sleep, still have bad nights. Clumsy, chest pain, swollen painful joints in hands, feel like I have a sinus infection and sore throat all the time, horrible sensitivity to sunlight, face feels like I do nothing but squint. Constantly gassy stomach and flatuence",Ohheck

It lowers the BP drastically once it’s taken and and metabolized by the body. Once it’s out of the system, BP readings go up so high, the highest 234/117.",Anonymous
