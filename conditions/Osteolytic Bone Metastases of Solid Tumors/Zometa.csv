2,Zometa,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 15, 2019",9,I took zometa for two years until I noticed a hole in my mouth where my jawbone was poking through.Now it’s been a year and the hole has tripled in size and is starting to get more painful.

3,Zometa,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 30, 2019",21,"I hate this drug.  I had perfect oral hygiene.  NO cavities, ever, even still have a baby tooth.  Always told by dentists how great my teeth were.Two years after zometa, I spontaneously end up with a hole in my mouth near my back molar where my jaw bone is visible.  Osteonecrosis of the jaw.  No treatment...just wait for it to do whatever its going to do...maybe a small piece of dead bone will come out, maybe my whole jaw will die, i just sit and wait to see.It’s getting bigger and feels awful.Then, my horrible oncologist refused to believe it and made me see other dentists, periodontist, and oral surgeons...and everyone confirmed ONJ.  Thankfully he quit, but I doubt he filled out the FDA paperwork that was sent to him, so my side effect incident probably didn't get reported.",Spike
4,Zometa,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,10.0,,"November 28, 2017",11,Been on it for about 4 years.   Very little side effects.  Maybe some lower back pain but I have terrible mets to bones almost everywhere that I could hardly tell if this med adds to pain.   No other problems.  I have been getting it for so long that they cut it back to every three months about 2 1/2 years ago.  Worried about necrosis to the jaw.,Ka3
5,Zometa,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 16, 2017",41,Had my first dose on Monday 12th June 2017. I was fine Monday night so felt quite positive​. Woke up Tuesday feeling like death! Wednesday felt better but had a painful red swollen left eye​ball. Long story short. I'm in agony with my eye and no one knows what to do! The hospital tried to say it wasn't a side effect! It's a very rare side effect but it is one! And the fact they know nothing about it or how to deal with it is disgusting and frightening! I will not be having this treatment again and will be taking this further!! They should not be giving people something if they don't know everything about it!,Jaclash

11,Zometa,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,,,"December 12, 2013",40,"I have had three infusions (1 monthly) intravenously administered.  No one advised that I should continue taking calcium supplements - good thing I asked! The first infusion led to three days of severe joint pain abating each day.  The second infusion had lesser effects and the third one lessened from the 2nd. Hydrate well before and after the injections. I've had transient chest pain, chills, side pain, episodes lasting for 1-2 minutes.",listener202
12,Zometa,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 5, 2013",65,"I have been receiving Zometa via IV infusion for about 3 years now - At first three weekly then after about a year, four weekly - I have breast cancer, bone metastasis. If I take the infusion over 15 minutes....during the following day I will begin with severe vomiting and flu symptoms which last for two days and nights after which I'm fine. However, if I have the infusion over 30 minutes - as advised on the internet way back in the early days of my treatments, I have NO side effects whatsoever - no sickness, no aches & pains! I have spoken to other women who have experienced the same - take the infusion slower, drink plenty of water, and you might just find your horrid side-effects disappear!",SueBubbles

14,Zometa,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,10.0,,"January 25, 2012",35,"I dreaded the side-effects and had NONE.  I had the intravenous infusion three days before Christmas 2011 and was scared that I would be flattened by the supposed side-effects like flu-like symptoms, bone ache and so forth and was pleasantly surprised.  I am having my second one in just ten days time and hopefully it will be a repeat of the first one.",boomerangbronwen
