0,Xgeva,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 12, 2021",2,I have prostate cancer that metastasized to the bone. This would be stage 4 prostate cancer. The prostate was removed by surgery 10 years earlier.  I have been getting Xgeva injections for about 14 months. The pain I notice is in both upper legs and my low back. Pain could be from cancer or Xgeva. Just don't know. The back hurts a lot.  I have learned to pre medicate with Alive or Tylenol about 2 hours before going to bed. This usually works. I go to bed without pain but it comes on as I lay in bed so I catch it early.,Mugglewart
1,Xgeva,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 8, 2020",21,"I just had my third dose of Xgeva, I have them monthly for Metastatic Breast Cancer . The first 2 times I had some lower back pain and minor aches and just feeling yucky for 24 hours.I had my 3rd shot yesterday. I woke up after midnight in a lot of pain. My bones, muscles and joints hurt. I was able to fall back to sleep but felt awful the next day and had more localized pain where my cancer is.When I related this to my doctors nurse she was surprised because she had never heard of this. I've read quite a few reviews of other patients experiencing the same thing. I'm uncertain as to continue taking this medication.",Jeffsjoy

3,Xgeva,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 8, 2019",18,"I have been on Xgeva for the last three years, I have breast cancer stage 3. I receive  the shots every 3 months and I take a calcium pill every day. I don’t have pain from the Xgeva. I only get a burning sensation with the shot. If I feel cramping in my legs I eat a banana everyday.  I don’t know how long it is effective? Does anyone else know how many years or how long you can take it or how long it is effective for?",Kim
