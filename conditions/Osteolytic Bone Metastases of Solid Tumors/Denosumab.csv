0,Denosumab,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 12, 2021",2,Xgeva (denosumab):I have prostate cancer that metastasized to the bone. This would be stage 4 prostate cancer. The prostate was removed by surgery 10 years earlier.  I have been getting Xgeva injections for about 14 months. The pain I notice is in both upper legs and my low back. Pain could be from cancer or Xgeva. Just don't know. The back hurts a lot.  I have learned to pre medicate with Alive or Tylenol about 2 hours before going to bed. This usually works. I go to bed without pain but it comes on as I lay in bed so I catch it early.,Mugglewart
1,Denosumab,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 8, 2020",21,"Xgeva (denosumab):I just had my third dose of Xgeva, I have them monthly for Metastatic Breast Cancer . The first 2 times I had some lower back pain and minor aches and just feeling yucky for 24 hours.I had my 3rd shot yesterday. I woke up after midnight in a lot of pain. My bones, muscles and joints hurt. I was able to fall back to sleep but felt awful the next day and had more localized pain where my cancer is.When I related this to my doctors nurse she was surprised because she had never heard of this. I've read quite a few reviews of other patients experiencing the same thing. I'm uncertain as to continue taking this medication.",Jeffsjoy

3,Denosumab,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 8, 2019",18,"Xgeva (denosumab):I have been on Xgeva for the last three years, I have breast cancer stage 3. I receive  the shots every 3 months and I take a calcium pill every day. I don’t have pain from the Xgeva. I only get a burning sensation with the shot. If I feel cramping in my legs I eat a banana everyday.  I don’t know how long it is effective? Does anyone else know how many years or how long you can take it or how long it is effective for?",Kim

5,Denosumab,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 12, 2012",12,"I have breast cancer with metastasis to the bone. Prior to taking Denosumab, I was receiving Zometa, {approximately 2 years on monthly basis}. One positive element that this is being given sub-cut, saving my veins, also it is not so hard on my kidneys. I do experience itching and back pain, but this only lasts about 1 week after the sub-cut. I have been receiving the injections approxmately 6 months, every month. I also take Aromasin and was diagnosed in April of 2007, my tumor marker is low at 22, remains at that number after making the switch from Zometa to Denosumab .",Anonymous
