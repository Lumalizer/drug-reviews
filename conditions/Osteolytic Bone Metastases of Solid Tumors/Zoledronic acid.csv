3,Zoledronic acid,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 11, 2019",2,"Zoledronic acid and OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW!I have been living with a hole in the back of my jaw where my jaw bone is exposed for almost a year now.I’m not sure how much of my bone is dead, but the hole keeps getting bigger and feels awful. When you get ONJ there is no one that can help.  Mostly you just wait and see how much of your jaw is going to fall off.  Most oral surgeons don’t want to touch it because they could make it worse.",Lilc
4,Zoledronic acid,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,2.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 30, 2019",21,"Zometa (zoledronic acid):I hate this drug.  I had perfect oral hygiene.  NO cavities, ever, even still have a baby tooth.  Always told by dentists how great my teeth were.Two years after zometa, I spontaneously end up with a hole in my mouth near my back molar where my jaw bone is visible.  Osteonecrosis of the jaw.  No treatment...just wait for it to do whatever its going to do...maybe a small piece of dead bone will come out, maybe my whole jaw will die, i just sit and wait to see.It’s getting bigger and feels awful.Then, my horrible oncologist refused to believe it and made me see other dentists, periodontist, and oral surgeons...and everyone confirmed ONJ.  Thankfully he quit, but I doubt he filled out the FDA paperwork that was sent to him, so my side effect incident probably didn't get reported.",Spike
5,Zoledronic acid,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 8, 2018",2,"Zometa IV @ 28 days for 6 months so far, no side effects; treated for stage 4 prostate cancer that had metastasized to bones (spine & ribs) and some lymph glands.  No pain to date, and no sig effect on energy levels.  I take high doses B12, Folate, regular multivitamins, 1000 mg calcium and 1000 units D3 daily, balanced diet.  I think it paid off well so far.",texan73
6,Zoledronic acid,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,3.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 25, 2018",4,"Maybe it helped me, since I had cancer all throughout my spine...but after 2 years, I spontaneously developed Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) because of this drug.  So, I haven’t broken my spine, but now I have a awful hole in my mouth where I can see my jaw bone, and I have to worry about my jaw bone dying off.  Keep working on a better drug guys!  This one sucks.",Ace
7,Zoledronic acid,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,10.0,,"November 28, 2017",11,Zometa (zoledronic acid):Been on it for about 4 years.   Very little side effects.  Maybe some lower back pain but I have terrible mets to bones almost everywhere that I could hardly tell if this med adds to pain.   No other problems.  I have been getting it for so long that they cut it back to every three months about 2 1/2 years ago.  Worried about necrosis to the jaw.,Ka3
8,Zoledronic acid,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 16, 2017",41,Zometa (zoledronic acid):Had my first dose on Monday 12th June 2017. I was fine Monday night so felt quite positive​. Woke up Tuesday feeling like death! Wednesday felt better but had a painful red swollen left eye​ball. Long story short. I'm in agony with my eye and no one knows what to do! The hospital tried to say it wasn't a side effect! It's a very rare side effect but it is one! And the fact they know nothing about it or how to deal with it is disgusting and frightening! I will not be having this treatment again and will be taking this further!! They should not be giving people something if they don't know everything about it!,Jaclash
9,Zoledronic acid,Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors,,,"February 23, 2017",12,"I have breast cancer metastisized to my bones. I had my first Zometa transfusion which lasted 30 min. & thought all went well, I am naturally a big water drinker (64 oz/ day norm) & drank more that day. However I woke up the next day feeling severely depressed, nauseous & without appetite. I made myself eat, & drank lots of water, I was barely urinating. My thirst was unquenchable & I had severe dry mouth. My temperature reached 102.4 in the afternoon & I had to go to the ER. They put me on anti-biotics right away, but I did not have any infection as it turned out,  it was all side-effects! They gave me a liter of fluids & I still went home with dry mouth.",Girl Gnome

No one advised that I should continue taking calcium supplements - good thing I asked! The first infusion led to three days of severe joint pain abating each day.  The second infusion had lesser effects and the third one lessened from the 2nd. Hydrate well before and after the injections. I've had transient chest pain, chills, side pain, episodes lasting for 1-2 minutes.",listener202

If I take the infusion over 15 minutes....during the following day I will begin with severe vomiting and flu symptoms which last for two days and nights after which I'm fine. However, if I have the infusion over 30 minutes - as advised on the internet way back in the early days of my treatments, I have NO side effects whatsoever - no sickness, no aches & pains! I have spoken to other women who have experienced the same - take the infusion slower, drink plenty of water, and you might just find your horrid side-effects disappear!",SueBubbles

I had the intravenous infusion three days before Christmas 2011 and was scared that I would be flattened by the supposed side-effects like flu-like symptoms, bone ache and so forth and was pleasantly surprised.  I am having my second one in just ten days time and hopefully it will be a repeat of the first one.",boomerangbronwen
