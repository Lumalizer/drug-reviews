0,Misoprostol,Abortion,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 31, 2022",0,"I’m only posting this because I was petrified and scared and want to share my experience to give ease and hope. I had an abortion at 5 weeks, no heartbeat. Unfortunately it was not the time to have my third child. With that being said I wanted it done as soon as possible to prevent later abortion. I was petrified to take the drugs, but my experience was not as bad as they post (vomiting etc.) I had heavy cramping and then seemed like a bad bad period. Remember the further along you are the worse it will be. I got passing clots 5 hours after the pills dissolved One was the size of a chicken breast And then smaller sized like gold balls. I’m glad it’s over but be brave and remembr you made a decision for your future. Please just try to not prolong it, xx Goodluck",Momof2
1,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 28, 2022",0,"Hello! This is for the ladies that were freaked about taking the pill. I am (was) 6 weeks pregnant! When I first heard about the symptoms from my doc and the comments I was also freaked out, I had a panic attack the day before taking the pill. When it was the day, I managed to to take the pill anyways. I took 4 of em. And as soon as I took them it wasn’t bad, I had moderate bleeding and a mild cramps, like my regular period (probably bc of my heating pad and soft snacks) and yea, I took the pain reliever and anti nausea medication beforehand. A day after the cramps were barely there and my bleeding was decreasing. Ladies, you will have to accept that our bodies are different and can handle different things! But girl you go this! Trust me! Just keep some saltine crackers, water and a hot water bottle or heating pad.  You got this!!",rayray
2,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 28, 2022",0,I was 10 weeks 1 day. Took the first pill in the doctors office (Friday) 3:30. Within a couple hours I was a little nauseous. It came and went wasn’t too bad. Sunday morning I took a Norco at 6:30am followed by the 4 pills in my checks. I kept the pills there until 10am. I drank water and swallowed what was left. Within 30 minutes I was experiencing cramps. More like contractions. On a scale of 1-10 they were a 10. Let me  mention I’m good at managing pain but this was on another level. I had terrible diarrhea for 2 hours + with pink spotting. I used a heating pad to help ease the pain. At some point I felt a drop to my lower pelvic area. Then a woosh of blood. I laid there for 15 minutes until it happened again. I went to the bathroom and the fetus was hanging out. I was in shock I took it and examined it (wish I didn’t do that) After I passed the fetus and a couple clots the pain eased up.,ALee09
3,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 26, 2022",0,"I promised myself I’d share my experience once the process is over. Tuesday - ultrasound + HCG + blood type test Wednesday - appointment with GP who does abortions Thursday - first pill - Mifepristone taken in front of doctor : gave me a dry throat 15 minutes in, a little cramping later, then I started bleeding on the Friday night (brown/dark blood) Saturday morning - (36 hours after mifepristone) I took 1 paracetamol, 1 x anti inflammatory (100mg ketoprofen), 1 x spasfon (French medication) followed by 400mg of misoprostol (2 pills, let them melt in cheeks) NO PAIN AT ALL JUST MINOR CRAMPING, and I usually have extremely painful periods. I had passed the pregnancy within 5 hours (no pain when passing just a weird sensation). I did look and I feel ok, I need confirmation. You’ll be fine I promise. This was this morning, I still have a bit of bleeding and cramps but I could honestly go to the gym.",5 week abortion

5,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,,"March 21, 2022",0,Ladies I want to share my personal experience because I read such bad reviews on this drug and it scared the living crap out of me. I was 5 1/2 weeks pregnant. I took the one pill called mifepristone in front of doctor then went home. This pill actually made me feel more sick than the actual abortion pill. Just some nausea but nothing too bad. The next morning I took the four pills of misoprostol on side of my cheeks and let them dissolve then swallowed whatever was left. I felt some cramps within 40 mins but nothing crazy. The medicine made me tired so I fell asleep for a little over a hour. I woke up went on toilet and passed four blood clots and a clot that looked like some blood with tissue I knew it was the fetus. I had no pain at all. Through out the day had some mild cramping on and off and that was it. I actually was in shock on how simple and painless the whole process was. Everyone is different though but for cramps I just took some Advil and it worked fine for me!!,Jane
6,Misoprostol,Abortion,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 21, 2022",1,I was 3 weeks pregnant. I decided to write my review cause not a lot are sharing from my perspective. When I took mifeprostone I felt intense cramping and slight spotting (occurred 20-21hrs) after taking it. I then took misoprostol 24hrs after talking mifeprostone. 1st 24hrs I only discharged a few clots and a brown mucous discharge plus the product of conception since I was 3 weeks it was still really tiny (like the head of a clothing pin) the 2nd 24hrs is when I started bleeding. So everyone is different you don't have to bleed immediately you  insert and take the misoprostolYOU WILL BE OKAY.,Hope_xx
7,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 17, 2022",0,"I was scared. On top of being scared I had no one to help me if something was to go wrong so that made me even more scared. I took the first pill around 11:30 on a Wednesday in the doctors office at 6 weeks pregnant. I then went home and around 11:30 that same day I took the other 4 pills vaginally (Misoprostol) and didn’t get back up for 2 hours. I then went to the bathroom and still nothing was happening. I went a laid down again. I fall asleep. I then woke up with blood and a small clot no cramps at all. I went back to sleep woke up and was bleeding much heavier and big clots,  still no cramps! My bleeding slowed down on Thursday the day around 6:30pm! This was a painless process! I was just very sleepy and a little light headed probably from the blood loss! You can do it and hopefully your experience is as good as mine!",Melly
8,Misoprostol,Abortion,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 17, 2022",0,"Cytotec (misoprostol):I had a Missed miscarriage W11 wouldn't come out.  The most violent and disgusting experience of my life. Put in 4 tablets- 3h later I was screaming and hulking folded over on the floor, shaking in pain. Then spent two hours on toilet bent over couldn't move in fear of projectile vomiting all over, sweat POURING down my body, couldn't speak. Passed out from pain while sitting on toilet, falling off, bloody pants at my ankles, woke up by hitting my forehead on the floor, breaking my glasses and cutting my face. Worst pain and diarrhoea of my life, my husband was trying to give me  some pain relievers. Blood on floor and bathroom carpet. After two hours I crawled off toilet onto floor into foetal position and convulsed under a pile of dirty laundry. 1h later my husband was able to convince me to move (without fainting or vomiting) to bed. When all this was over and I managed to eat and clean myself up I started crying in shock over the violence I had gone through.",Half dead

11,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 9, 2022",0,"Ladies, You may have an easy medical abortion and that’s what we all hope for but sometimes it’s not. Respect the fact we are all different, with different tolerances, different bodies, and also how far along we are. For me I would never do an MA again. I was 6-9 weeks pregnant when I did an MA at home. I don’t know the exact date as I had irregular periods. The side effects of what they tell you to expect with miso is vague. With that in mind I consider it more harmful to be ill informed. The truth is this stuff sucks! I’m not saying this to scare you. I’m saying this for you to be aware and put your big girl pants on because you can do this!   So prior to doing this, research and listen to the stories the good and bad. There’s med reviews, Exhale, reddit r/abortion, NAF website, Planned Parenthood, and the list goes on. Everyone’s experience riding this storm is different. I think that if you know what to expect it’s easier. Good Luck and stay strong!",Kelsofox
12,Misoprostol,Abortion,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 4, 2022",15,Alot of these comments don't include how many weeks pregnant they are which is a very important factor in terms of what to expect pain wise. Someone who is only 2 weeks pregnant is more likely to experience less pain and bleeding than someone who is 8 weeks pregnant. These comments would be more useful if you stated your gestation.,Anonymous
13,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2022",0,"When I read this page, I was waiting for the pills. I promised I would write a review because I know how you must feel right now. So let me reassure you, YOU WILL BE OK. You are going through a lot and you are very very brave. ❤I took Mifepristone, and nothing happened after. I followed instructions and waited. I vaginally inserted the Misoprostol pill at 5pm because I didn't want the pain to affect my work. About 11pm, I started to see a bit of blood coming out. It started to hurt like a bad period (I would say 6-7 out of 10, but nothing compared to IUD/IUS insertion or cervix infection from rough sex, promise). It continuously hurt throughout the whole night, and I needed a hot water bottle to feel better. Yes it hurt. But nothing you cannot handle. During the night (about 3-4am) I felt like I had period blood coming out (WEAR PADS!) and went to the bathroom. Palm-size clogged blood came out. I continued to bleed like a period and stopped after 2-3 weeks.You can do it!",bubblegum
14,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 28, 2022",0,"After reading everyone’s stories, I decided I should share mine. I found out I was pregnant and immediately had morning sickness all day every day. I knew I was not ready to have a baby, being 21 and caring for a family member, having the baby wasn’t an option for me.  The next Saturday at 11:00 am I took the first pill in the clinic. I didn’t have any side effects at all. Sunday at 11:00 am I took the 4 pills orally. At 11:30 am I swallowed was was left. Around 12 I got sick. I was scared it wasn’t going to work. I laid in bed and closed my eyes and about an hour later I passed my first clot. And not long after I passed 2 or 3 more. It didn’t hurt and wasn’t uncomfortable, just weird. I did have diarrhea, but only once. Also had bad cramps, but usually I do when I’m on my period, so it wasn’t unbearable. I even went to the store later that evening. I was terrified but it wasn’t nearly as bad as I was expecting. Reading other peoples stories on this site helped me.",Anonymous
15,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 26, 2022",1,"Day 1: Took the first pill at 11:10 2/24/22 at the clinic. Drove myself 2 hours back home. Slight cramps, fatigue, and spotting occurred an hour later. Day 2: 24 hours later while at work in my office, I took promephizine (anti-nausea meds) at 2:30 pm. At 3:30 pm I got the 4 pills and put 2 in each cheek for 30 mins then swallowed. 30 mins to an hour I felt cramps. Drove home pretty well and laid down. Got up at 6:15 pm, had diarrhea. Then a few mins later I felt a huge blob fall out of me and into the toilet. I didn’t look but I knew what happened. Went back to the bathroom for more diarrhea like 5 more times which caused me to be so weak. A little pepto helped me out. I also took a Tylenol for the pain. Honestly, the pain is like your average period cramps except it’s extremely intense. Be prepared by taking pain meds.",Jane Doe
16,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 20, 2022",4,"I was around 4-5 weeks pregnant. I was prepared for the worst but it was not that bad. I was instructed to take all 4 tablets vaginally. Cramping began within 15 minutes, but I didn’t start bleeding for about 5 hours. The pain was about a 5/10 in my opinion. I took the pain reliever dosage I was prescribed but I did not take the gravol I was given. Only needed two rounds of pain relievers overall. The real lifesaver was my heating pad. Bleeding was heavy, about twice as heavy as my period on its worst day (I used an overnight maxi pad for the first time in my life). But it subsided the next morning and currently I am on day two, and only very light bleeding at this point. I am so relieved this is done with and glad I did the medical route rather than surgery. Just be prepared with any supplies you need (painrelievers, heating pad, maxi pads) and a good TV show and you will be okay.",Feb 2022

18,Misoprostol,Abortion,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 15, 2022",0,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING A SURGICAL ABORTION. I previously had an abortion and did the surgical one where I was put to sleep, felt no pain, & woke up fine - just tired. I figured I’d do medical to avoid having to get surgery again but doing the medical abortion with these pills was the worst experience ever. Shortly after the pills dissolving in my mouth, I began shaking awfully, was throwing up nonstop, had diabetes, and awful cramps that were more like contractions, and bleeding HORRIBLY. I can handle pain and being sick but this was the flu times 40. It was really a horrid experience. Please consider getting the surgical abortion instead and save yourself the misery.",Vee
19,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 11, 2022",2,"Don't listen to bad reviews!!! I was super scared to take the pill because of how painful everyone else said it was. I took the second set of pills (inserted all 4 vaginally) at 8:30pm and the pain was light at first about an hour later. I wouldn't even say that the cramps themselves were what made it bad, just the fact that it was consistent, heavy cramping for 4-5 hours straight. I would definitely make sure you have a heating pad and someone there to rub your back because at a certain point it gets pretty painful. It's definitely not a walk in the park, but the pain is manageable. I found it a lot less painful when I was standing up/ leaning over the bed (sitting/ laying down made it SO much worse for me), but that could just be me. Either way, don't freak out. Remember, it's only temporary. You can do it!",flowergirl123
20,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 11, 2022",0,"I wanted to share my experience because I was HORRIFIED. I have had one in clinic procedure before and was hoping the pill would be a better, less painful option. Docs said after taking Misoprostol I would have severe cramping and heavy bleeding. I took the first pill at the clinic at 11 am on day 1. Felt slight (VERY VERY SLIGHT) cramping and was very tired, but no obvious signs of anything re. Took the 4 pills of Misoprostol vaginally around 1:30 PM on day 2 with 800mg ibuprofen and a nausea tablet. Took a nap. Woke around four hours later and nothing had happened but two small drops of blood in my pad. I was worried it wasn't working. Around an hour later the bleeding began with very very slight cramping. I was shaking with fear waiting for the worst to begin...but it didn't come. I had cramps about 3/10 on and off for a few hours and some moderate bleeding. I am on day three with intermittent gushes of blood and small 2/10 cramps. Everyone's experience is different. Good luck!",Experience
21,Misoprostol,Abortion,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 9, 2022",0,"I hope this helps someone make a decision: I was 4-5 weeks and gestational sac was barely visible on the ultrasound. I took the first medication at 10am with the Dr present, I didn’t feel nauseous only had a slight cramping later on that day.  I took the 4 misoprostol pills between gum and cheek at 3pm next day after I had lunch and took pain relievers.  I felt cramps right away and bleeding started as well. Tylenol3 prescription is essential and helped tremendously. Cramps intensified to about 8/10 very quickly, I felt a weird pain in my bum and went to the washroom and felt something slid right out that looked like a big clot. I didn’t have a lot of clots maybe one more and the rest were tiny.  About 6 hours later the pain all of a sudden stopped and I felt almost comfortable just very tired and hungry and my throat and cheeks hurt from the pills. I have an ultrasound to make sure all was expelled and if it was it wasn’t as bad as I was expected. I never got nausea or diarrhea.",Leila
22,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,,"February 8, 2022",3,"I was soooo stressed before hand, having major anxiety attacks etc. But it all went so smoothly!!! Felt sick after the first pill but I think that was mainly anxiety. After I finally worked up the courage to take misoprostol (36 hours later), I dissolved the four pills and waited. I felt cramps 30 minutes later, they were bad but completely manageable. I took codeine and after about 30 minutes the cramps became very mild. Bleeding lasted for 7 hours then calmed down a lot, over all was not as traumatising as I thought it would be. If you are stressed just take your pain releivers and trust that you will be totally fine, and this is coming from someone with a low pain tolerance and major anxiety!",Anonymous

Sunday night into Monday morning I started to bleed and needed a pad. Passed a big blood clot Wednesday morning. I was afraid it wasn’t working or it might be ectopic remember ladies you have 72 hours to begin bleeding. As far as pain I experienced back pain like I do when I’m on my period. Didn’t feel the tissue come out until I got up and it slid out. You could do this!!,Jayda
26,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 26, 2022",1,Age 22 first pregnancy chose this method over the surgical which was recommended to me at 9 weeks. I was blissfully unaware that this medicine causes labor contractions and the medication they prescribed did not measure up to labor pain. I missed work the next day and it’s been days and haven’t slept good waking up with bad cramping worse than any cramping I’ve had in a regular cycle. It is 3 am right now and I would not wish my experience on anyone. Maybe you will have good luck it seems others were successful. I just wish I had chose the surgery.,Pain
27,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,,"January 21, 2022",4,So I’m sharing my experience because I was so scared. I cried over and over again because I was literally so scared. I went and took the first pill at the clinic then they gave me 4 more pills to take three hours after the first pill or 24 hours by mouth. I opted for mouth because that seemed more natural to me. I put two in one check and two pills in the other. I waited for 30 minutes then swallowed down what was left. I could feel the cramps coming and I also felt bleeding immediately after I swallowed everything. I have 5 kids and the bleeding wasn’t near as bad as the bleeding after child birth. Like I didn’t bleed a lot at all. My cramping was a 6/10 but I also don’t get period cramps so That may have played a part. I never had an urge to sit on the toilet or anything I would just go because I could feel blood and the cramps would get uncomfortable so I assumed something needed to pass. I passed like 4 clots. This experience was so easy and I’m a whimp.,Gangel24

I was 7 weeks ~4 days and took 4 pills vaginally at 5pm. Within 30 mins I had minor cramps. They slowly got a bit worse over the next 3 hours. By 8:30 the cramps were bad but nothing too wild - I could talk and walk and relax. I felt like each time I peed, a clot would come out so I drank a ton of water. Around 9:30 the cramps got bad for about an hour (7/10) and a bigger clot came out, but again, nothing too crazy.  I had an appetite, no diarrhea, but did throw up around 10pm when the cramps were the worst, but this was from nausea and not the pain.  After that bigger clot, I felt a bit better and was able to sleep around 12am.  I woke up from the cramps at 3am but went away quickly. In terms of pain meds, I took 800mg ibuprofen when I inserted the pills, another around 9:30, and again at 3am. Woke up and it’s over!! MILD cramps but nothing else. Whew.",Poppy2

I would guess about 5/6 weeks. And every day that passed felt like forever. So searched the web, closest Clinic was far and wanted me to wait weeks to get in. I found a site that I paid $330 for the meds, I got them 6 days later. I waited the 24 hours to take the last 4 by mouth. About 1:15h the cramps came with pain. 8/10 pain for me and they last lasted about 2 hours. When it was so intense I went to the bathroom and pushed a little and finally saw pinkish light bleeding. Sat there for about 30 mins in pain and chills. Once I got up there was a clot the size of a dime and when I wiped I THINK I saw a clear liquid with the blood could be the sac.

I was 5-6 weeks pregnant when I took the cervix softener and 30 hours later I took 1 anti-nausea 2 panadol and 2 ibuprofen then an hour later dissolved 4 misoprostol in my gums. After 30 minutes, I got bad period cramps which steadily increased to the most extreme pain I have ever felt, and I normally have painful periods. I vomited a few times, had diarrhea, the pain was so extreme I thought I was going to die - my body couldn't handle it. I had to lie down in the shower where I passed out for over an hour and couldn't move, codeine didn't help. I got 20 minutes of extreme chest pain a few hours in. I bled but with no clots, which led to a trip to the ED where I found out the pills had not expelled the pregnancy, and a week later I got a surgical abortion.

Also please make a research on how they do it in other countries. When you take the abortion pill in Europe you are observation at the hospital for 24 hours just in case. Here in the US they say do it at home for privacy. Trust me you don’t need privacy when you are loosing all the fluids of your body and fainting. Doctors can reanimate you, not your husband, or untrained friends. Please be very careful and mindful of your health. Do not take any risk because it can turn really bad. Every woman is different.

33,Misoprostol,Abortion,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 31, 2021",0,Cytotec (misoprostol):It got the job done but I would not advise anyone to take it without medical supervision. The pain was horrendous. It was the worst pain imaginable and I felt like I was dying. I had to take all the pain meds within 15 minutes of taking the cytotec. However I threw up all of the pain meds right away so I had to endure the pain for about 5 hours before I called an ambulance. I then had to wait an additional time for them to give me something for the pain. So for gods sake do not take this at home.,Bobin

I was 6 weeks and 1 day when I took the medication. There was literally not even a fetus in the sac yet. (Which honestly made me feel better) this was a really hard decision but it was ultimately what was best. I took the first pill in the doctors office at 11:30am. I had no side effects all day after taking that. I was instructed to take the last 4 pills at 7:30pm that night and let them dissolve into your cheeks 2 on each side. Right before I let them dissolve I took 800mg ibuprofen. It took a while for them to dissolve. About an hour. By 8:30 they were finally dissolved. No taste just really chalky. By 9:30 I was bleeding bright red and cramping. The cramps were not bad at all. Felt less than period cramps. By 1:42am I passed the pregnancy. A lot of tissue and clots came out. It's the next morning & I'm fine.,Sagehouse

Everyone is different, but you will get cramps and you will feel like you want to go to the hospital. I took the anti-nausea pill and 800mg Ibuprofen before all of this as well. So when the cramps were happening, I sucked it up! (Easier said than done) fell asleep and 2 hours later, I felt blood! It wasn’t a lot but it wasn’t too little. It was perfect.

I took the oral pill around 10 am Saturday morning and then inserted the vaginal tablets around 6pm Sunday evening. Cramps started around 1-2 hours after inserting. The cramps were painful sometimes unbearable for the next few hours. The pain relief the doctor prescribed me made me drowsy so I was able to drift in and out of a sleep I did not pass the fetus until 5am the next day so it took almost 12 hours and the pain I had the next day along with heavy bleeding wasn't great. I can see most women had a good experience but don't ignore the reviews as they have stated because every woman's body is different.

Today I took my first 4 misoprostol at 1 pm orally. Within 15 min of letting it dissolve in my mouth, I felt a big cramp. After 30 min of letting the pill dissolve I swallowed the rest with water and immediately threw up. I also started bleeding and passing some minor clots. I experienced very minor to no cramps during this time. I took my second 4 misoprostol pills at 9pm and felt perfectly fine. I did get a few more minor cramps than I previously had but I honestly thought my experience was going to be so much worse, everybody’s body is different but all will be fine. You got this!",Anonymous
73,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2021",0,"I was just over 6 weeks pregnant when I took misoprostol to end my pregnancy. I’d already had a surgical abortion once before, but this was my first medical abortion & I was nervous because it’s different for everyone & I didn’t know exactly what to expect. I took pain killers & anti-nausea medication 30 minutes before the misoprostol. I put the four pills in my cheeks & I waited. The cramping started before I swallowed the rest of the pills in my lip, somewhere towards the end of the 30 minutes you’re supposed to keep them in for. The cramping gradually got worse from that point on, but nothing unbearable. It just felt like menstrual cramps. The bleeding started around 30 minutes after I swallowed the pills, the whole process started very fast for me. I passed clots for about 2 hours & then it was over. If you’re nervous, it’s okay. I was too. ♥️",tacobell

Few days later, pregnancy symptoms started to show and it was apparent it had backfired. At 9 weeks pregnant, I decided to repeat the process. I took 4 misoprostol pills under the tongue. Felt literal chills which subsided after a while. I started cramping a bit and some blood came out. After 4 hours, I took 4 more misoprostol pills under the tongue and I experiences intense chills, high fever for like 1 hour. I started cramping, and bleeding started. I passed a big clot and a few more when peeing. I also did have diarrhea but it stopped on its own. Today marks 2 days after the procedure and I have steady bleeding, mild on and off cramps and  the pregnancy symptoms seem to be going away gradually ie I can now eat without feeling nauseated, also I have vomited like once only instead of like 10 times like i would have.

75,Misoprostol,Abortion,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 1, 2021",0,"I suffered a miscarriage at almost 12 weeks. The resident at my OB’s office offered me misoprostol before we explored the idea of a D&C because after what I’ve been through, I just didn’t want anything invasive. I inserted all 4 tablets and laid down to take a nap. I woke up later with moderate cramping. I have an 8cm ovarian cyst and painful periods, so I am no stranger to pain. I have a very high pain tolerance. Within about an hour, the pain got progressively worse and went from cramping to full on contractions. This was by far the worst pain I’ve ever experienced - I almost passed out after the first two waves. My uterus was searing. I told my husband we needed to go to the hospital. I had to be wheeled in. I was on the verge of passing out from pain and began vomiting. It took two IV doses of morphine to bring my pain from way beyond a 10 down to a 5. Avoid if you can, but I can see why people find it to be a good option. Not me though.",Ehc

I didn't bleed for hours because I chose to insert vaginally and it took some struggling to get them up far enough so they would start to work. I was standing in my kitchen about 5 maybe six hours after inserting second dose vaginally when this gush came all at once. It was pretty heavy and the cramps were similar those of a really heavy period and sometimes very contraction like pains. That night was long but nothing unbearable. The day after dose it was a little better and today my second day after my last dose has been bittersweet. At times the pain is intense and it can be dull. My menstrual is normally very heavy so my body responded as I thought it would. My best advice is to not be afraid, plan on taking some days off if needed because some people need extra time depending on how it affected them. I think this was an overall positive experience for me. I feel once I'm rested I'll be fine.",Anonymous

I took it at ten weeks so my experience may differ from someone who is earlier along. I also suggest asking your doctor which over the counter pain medication works best ( I didn't take this step). The medication worked within 2 hours and was very efficient. I had little pain and it was comparable to a regular period after passing the pregnancy. I had a hard time acquiring the pill because no pharmacy I went to kept it in stock, if you are also having this problem then I would suggest going to a clinic. The clinic I went to helped me tremendously and acquired the medication for me the very next day. Good luck, whichever step you choose to take is the right one",User

Also felt sick but never vomited. I had some brown discharge but no blood. The pain was a dull ache for a while but I never bled. So four hours later I took two more tablets. Still didn’t bleed. I didn’t bleed on Sunday either so we panicked thinking that the tablets weren’t working. We called the nurse who booked us in for a scan on Wednesday but told us it can take 5 days to start bleeding. 36 hours after taking the tablets, I start bleeding.

Still just mild cramps and passing clots so I feel a lot better than earlier.

I am generally a sensitive person and tend to experience heavy bleeding/cramps during my normal period. I took the pills and felt extremely nauseas. If you are also prone to nausea please ask for anti-nausea medicine, it will help you so much! Unfortunately I did not and I ended up throwing up the medicine within 20 minutes which is very scary because it could impact the effects of the drug! Luckily my body had absorbed the medicine in time and I successfully still had the abortion (thank goodness). I personally experienced heavy bleeding/cramps for a few hours which I combated with tylenol and a heating pad. I threw up a few times due to the nausea but the entire experience just felt like a bad period. My situation was difficult because I know my body is sensitive to drugs and I am anemic so I cramp a lot, so if you are not like me the process will be WAY easier for you. You will get through this!

109,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 1, 2021",1,I am writing this review to hopefully help those reading it. I am single and recently divorced so essentially starting my life over. I found out I was pregnant on Sept 25th after taking two pregnancy tests. I made the difficult decision to terminate the pregnancy on Sept 26th since I was not far along 4 to 5 weeks. I took the Mifepristone at 7:40 in the evening on the 28th. I had no adverse effects. I had a 24 to 48 hour window to take the misoprostol I chose to wait until 45 hours after the mifepristone and am extremely happy I did because the first medication actually induced my body to start the abortion naturally at about 43 hours so I started passing clots and bleeding before I took the second medication.

I was very emotional, crying because I felt so bad doing the abortion and doing this to my baby I was 8 weeks and 4 days, but it was the best option for me at the time. Around 9:20pm cramps started, light period pains would come and go. 11:11pm I passed the pregnancy. I was about to be vomit and as I was about to be sick, I pushed out the pregnancy. I didn’t know what happened I froze and started shaking I stood up slowly and my passed pregnancy fell to the floor. I had a panic attack, blood was just everywhere I didn’t know what to do.Eventually got myself together and cleaned up. 00:35am took 4x codeine as cramps were getting worse 00:40 I took the last 2 tablets of misoprotol vaginally… Cramps were coming and going I eventually got sleep at around 4:30am and slept till about 8am.

112,Misoprostol,Abortion,8.0,,"September 26, 2021",22,"Firstly, it is okay to feel worried and scared in such a huge matter. I got my pills by post and would recommend to anyone going through this who would prefer to be in the comfort of their home instead of in and out clinics which may make some feel more anxious. The first tablet was absolutely fine you may feel a little sick, after a day make sure you take some pain relievers beforehand for the first lot of misoprostol it can be painful and I would recommend doing these vaginally instead of oral, everyone’s experiences will be different depending on how you may deal with pain. After 3-4 hours you will need to take a second dose of misoprostol please don’t be afraid this lot is not at all painful it just makes sure everything is flushed out preventing infection! finally please just know you are not alone, you can do this!!",Anonymous

Laid down and 5 mins later felt like I had to go to the toilet again, that's when I passed the pregnancy. Minimal small clots since and bleeding just as a heavy period.

I took my second pills all orally at 5:50am on a Sunday and pain relief 20 mins before hand. I then slept until 9am. I woke up and felt cramps, went to the toilet and passed 2 clots & felt a bit nauseous. My cramps worsened for the next 30 minutes but still bearable, I went to the toilet passed 2 more clots and felt almost instant relief. I think that’s when I passed the pregnancy.

Cramps were painful for about 45 min but not at all excruciating and instantly relieved when passed products of conception.The key here is DO NOT take the medication at night and then fall asleep, wake up with cramps and then try to catch up with pain meds on an empty stomach.

I was advised to take the medication vaginally, so maybe that's why the pain was intense. Inserted the first dose at home on Thursday (vaginally) 2PM and it was fine for the whole day. Took the second vaginally on the Friday around the same time, about an hour later my stomach began to tingle/burn up. The pain was period cramps and MORE, it was extremely painful. I thought because it was so early on, it wouldn't be so painful but damn! It's now Saturday evening and the pain isn't so bad, I've been bleeding quite a bit and clotting. I'd seriously advice getting strong pain meds and iron tablets. You are losing a substantial amount of blood and you need to look after yourselves. Doing it over the weekend is much better, take time off work if necessary because everyone is different and it can take a toll on your body especially if you're anaemic.

Apparently this isn't how it should happen so invited back to clinic had tests and a scan- confirmed retained products. Offered more misoprostol  but only 4 this time again only bled 24 hours later for 2 hours.

Some of yall look like they gave you pain meds? Would have been nice.I was in excruciating pain, I wanted to vomit for 4 straight hours, lying on the bathroom floor, diarrhea, shivering violently. I've always considered myself to have a pretty high pain tolerance, but honestly when I say this is the worst pain I've ever experienced. That being said! When you finally get past the ceaseless walls of agony, you feel great. I am exhausted, but can finally eat, and will sleep very well tonight. Prepare for A LOT of chunky blood, but that was the least of my concerns as the pain I had gone through was so bad I considered going to the ER.Anyway, hope this helps!",Anonymous

That was the FURTHEST thing from the truth. These pills literally induce labor so you can expel the fetus. The amount of blood was sickening. The labor pains went on for 7 whole hours. I was screaming in pain the entire time. This is what going into labor feels like except you have no pain relief like an epidural. Do yourself a favor and do the suction procedure under anesthesia.

I’ve delivered a healthy baby boy before so I know contractions. They were way worse than cramps!!! I’ve been bleeding moderately everyday with cramps that sometimes intensify. I’ve also suffered nausea. And complete loss of appetite. The thought of having to eat a meal makes me feel sick. In my opinion the surgical abortion hurts for one day then it’s over. The pill seems to be an unlimited time of discomfort and severe pain. I have a high pain tolerance but this is intense. Everyone is different but in my opinion, the pill prolongs the process and has been very painful. I’ll take another pregnancy test Sunday to see if the process worked.

On Sunday I went in to hospital and had the 4 tablets inserted vaginally and started bleeding around an hour after this. I was also provided with an anti biotic to be inserted. I felt slight cramps nothing worse than a period and I had passed the pregnancy after around 3 hours. Had some larger blood clots but nothing too extreme and was in and out of the toilet for a few hours. I left the hospital at 5 the same day and now have only slight bleeding the next day. Please don’t overly worry and read the bad things online has my experience was nothing like the horror story’s! Good luck to everyone going through this you can do it!,ac12345679

I took my first tablet Mifepristone at 21:30 on Thursday evening - I did feel very sick but I was already suffering from HG in the early days so I think it was my general sickness. 18:15 Yesterday (Saturday evening) I inserted 4 Misoprostol vaginally it’s much better to do it this way less side effects I promise you! Within 45 minutes I was bleeding, I passed a palm sized clot with is not a nice feeling at all but not painful I promise! I was back and fourth to the toilet till about 21:00 passing some pretty impressive sized clots which I think was all tissue etc. Throughout all of this I only had a hot bean bag on my tummy and 1000MG of paracetamol for pain relief. I'm barely bleeding now, a few crampy twinges nothing more than a bad period pain. I had worked myself up to the max with all these horror stories I do have severe health anxiety to.

I usually have regular periods with no cramping . I took the pills vaginally and from my experience this was the worse night of my life the pain was so bad. I couldn’t sleep threw up a few times and it last from 1 am till 7:30 am . I was given ibuprofen 800 mg and it didn’t help. I was trying a heating pad then switching to cold compresses. Different  laying down positions and nothing helped. I’m sharing this so others can be prepared. I hope you are one of the lucky ones that can compare it to period cramps. I have had a child and no pain medication or epidural and labor only lasted 5 hours .This for me it was worse then being in labor and lasted much longer .

Around 2:48am I got up to use the bathroom and began to vomit and mild diarrhea & there was one little blood clot. I dozed off and got up around 4am to use the bathroom and at this time I expelled 4 large clots (which I believe was the pregnancy), still with heavy period like cramps. At around 4:48am I got up to use the bathroom again and at this time I passed another large size clot and had some more mild diarrhea. Finally around 9:30am the cramps began to subside.",Brave12

For a few hours, I felt like I was having a normal period. The cramps intensified only when I was about to pass clots and heavy tissue. No huge lemon sized clots! It was uncomfortable but so much more bearable than I thought. A heating pad helped, and I was instructed to alternate between 800mg ibuprofen and 1000mg Tylenol every 4 hours. One thing my nurse told me that I am thankful for is that if you insert the pills vaginally, which you can do up to 9 weeks, you are less likely to have negative side effects. I took the pills vaginally and I had no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, etc. I even ate dinner during the time that I was bleeding. It felt like a period, that became heavy and more painful intermittently. Make sure you are at home, in a comfy place. If this is the option you choose, you really will be okay!",Afdepaolo

I took 2 pills vaginally and then 5 hours later took the other 2 pills. After 30 minutes I had intense intense cramping and passed several clots about the size of my palm. Then I started throwing up and I’ve never felt so miserable in my life. (Mentally as well) then after the second dose the cramping was even worse and I just couldn’t stop crying. After 2 and a half weeks I was still bleeding heavily and would get bouts of severe cramps. So my dr prescribed them again because I still had a lot of tissue to get out. Every woman is different but I can honestly say this is one of the worst pains I’ve ever experienced. Hopefully this second dose works.,Jenjen4323

First, I took the Mifepristone at about 11pm on a Saturday night and I bled a tiny bit about 23 hours after taking the pill. About 25 hours after I took the first pill, I took the 4 Misoprostol pills by mouth and 800mgs of Ibuprofen. About an hour after I swallowed the pills I started cramping. It started out as light cramps, but then slowly turned into more intense cramps but they were very manageable. My bleeding was heavy but not as heavy as I thought it was going to be. About 12 hours after I took the 4 pills, I passed a decent sized clot which was me passing the pregnancy.

But I was already invested so I continued with the others. I took a nausea pill and ibuprofen and dissolved the 4 others for 30mins then swallowed the remains. 1 hour later the cramps and blood were very intense. For roughly 6-8 hrs I was glued to my bed.

263,Misoprostol,Abortion,8.0,,"March 23, 2021",0,"I am a person who has bad period pains. Anyway I was 10 weeks pregnant (this was a few months ago). I don’t know if it was made worse because I was only a few days from having to have a surgical abortion but I was in intense pain with very heavy bleeding for about 8 hours with 3 hours of excruciating pain (however I did lose the codeine they gave me).  I thought I had a high pain threshold. I also saw the sack and the pregnancy separately as they fell into my pants when I ran to the loo. I bled for another week but was in no pain other than that day. Don’t want to scare anyone, wouldn’t take it back for the world, worth it. But I’d say at 10 weeks maybe wait for surgical abortion if you have bad periods anyway. It’s hard to remember pain afterwards but I remember thinking that it was the most pain I’d ever been in and that I didn’t know if I’d ever be able to give birth and if I did I wanted a c section.

Then 24 hours later I took the 4 tablets that I to let sit for 30 minutes and then swallow. After about an hour, I started mildly cramping with some diarrhea. Then after about another 30 minutes I experienced the worst pain I ever felt in my life. I took some ibuprofen it didn't help. I sat on the toilet for about 45 minutes and felt a gush come out and the cramps subsided for a little. I had to take another dose of the misoprostol so I did that and the same thing happened. It was the worst pain I ever felt and I normally get bad cramps with periods but this was different. I definitely recommend getting the surgical procedure if you can. Overall the medicine worked but it's not worth the pain.",Anonymous
290,Misoprostol,Abortion,9.0,,"February 21, 2021",2,"I was almost 11 weeks & this was one of the most painful experiences of my life (& I’ve had 2 c-sections). I was screaming into a pillow as loud as I could in the fetal position. Not everyone will have the same pain levels, but be prepared! I think it is because I didn’t have my ibuprofen 800 or hydrocodone in time to take 30 minutes before the second pills (first pills you take at home). I had to wait about 45 minutes after I took the four pills (they dissolve in your mouth for 30 minutes, 2 in each cheek), but they didn’t seem to help much. After hours of agony, I pushed a large amount of blood out, and the pain subsided for a bit. Then later that night the cramps were back just as strong, but less frequent. Eventually they stopped and I was able to sleep. Take your pain meds before, and during (safely) hot water helps, heating pads help slightly. I was unable to do anything due to the pain, so make sure you have help, and no responsibilities that day.",VAL
291,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,,"February 21, 2021",5,First off let me say that after reading these reviews it had me so freaking scared of taking misoprostol thinking I was going to have a bad experience but thank goodness I had a good experience with this. I took the first pill at the clinic after went to eat at Denny's no side effects other than feeling a little nauseous. Nothing major though then next day at 4:30pm took two 200mg of ibuprofen then at 5pm took the misoprostol I put 4 into my mouth 2 on each side it had to dissolve for a hour between my gums and cheeks and shortly after started feeling crampy nothing major at all. It is now 9:25pm and only symptoms I've got was mild cramping and diarrhea that's it!! So please if you came here like me looking for reviews as this was my first abortion ever don't get all scared and freaking out like me because everyone is different and good luck to you!,Kris
292,Misoprostol,Abortion,10.0,,"February 20, 2021",5,Cytotec (misoprostol):I was prescribed this after it was found I had a missed miscarriage at just shy of ten weeks.The doc first gave me 18 tabs with instructions to take 600 mcg every 6 hours for up to 6 doses. It did nothing but give me severe runny stools. I called in for another round as a last ditch effort before scheduling a D&C. I did research and its actually recommended to use 800 mcg inserted vaginally high up near the cervix and you can repeat this once in a 24 hour period. The reason some docs don't prescribe it this way is that there were some women who ended up with severe infection so SCRUB YOUR HANDS with soap and water if you choose to do it this way. I inserted the 4 tabs before bed and woke up 8 hours later with mild cramping that quickly progressed to severe with lots of blood. I bled through three pads in 60 minutes and then passed the fetus after 10 hours. The pain eased up a bit and 2 hours later I passed the placenta. Things gradually eased up after that into like a heavy period.,Dolly

I had read so many horror stories online about how terrible it was which made me so nervous. To be honest I would have to say only about an hour was really hard. I had taken neproxan before taking step 2 but should have taken my Tylenol 3s sooner than I had. I waited about 4 hours to take them and during that time I had an hour or so of serious cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. But once I was able to get myself back into bed with my hot water bottle they had started to kick in and I was able to sleep a bit.

I started having cramps within 3-4 hours but they were manageable with Aleve and a hot water bottle. It is now 1 week since I've taken those pills and the bleeding has not stopped. The cramps and bleeding got even worse within the last 3 days, I can hardly manage and I definitely can't function in work. NEVER AGAIN!

Had a little breakfast and took the nausea medication along with 800mg ibuprofen and inserted the 4 pills vaginally. I fell asleep for about 3 hours and woke up with major cramps. Went to the bathroom and had a few small clots and one about the size of a golfball. Basically for about an hour I had some intense contractions and took a Tylenol 3. I  also highly recommend using a heating pad, I felt a good amount of relief when I put it on. Still feeling slight contractions (took med at 8am and its 4:40pm). I haven't been nauseous or had any diarrhea. Just feel tired and sore with mild cramps. It's not a horrible experience, if you've ever had a cyst on your ovaries its similar. I suggest eating and taking a pain medication and anti nausea medication 30 minutes or so before hand. Good luck ladies, you will get through it. Its not pleasant but not the worst either.

I have endometriosis so I thought it couldn’t get any worse but let me tell you it got 10x worse. I was crying and howling like crazy in bed then it would stop for a few minutes and the pain will be back! Went to the bathroom to pee out the blood I thought only to feel really hot and faint on the bathroom floor from all the pain and blood I had lost! After waking up on the floor I crawled back to bed and lay there dizzy and feeling nausea and like I was about to pass out again! This pain continued for the rest of the 4hrs therefore I only lost my tissue on the 6th hour so went through the entire pain process time!! 10/10 for pain! Would not wish on anyone,Anonymous

I was back and forth from the toilet to the floor and just when I thought I couldn’t take the pain anymore  I passed the sac and within 5 minutes felt instant relief. I’m pretty sure I experienced similar pains to labor but I would do it again if I had to. Yes, it was painful but once it was done it was ok. I had heavy bleeding for about 4 days and then it slowed down to normal period amount.

Did feel lightheaded when getting out of bed to go to the toilet, (my boyfriend helped me out to navigate myself from bedroom to the toilet). When I did get to the toilet, that’s when I saw blood clots and the actual pregnancy. Got rid of it, showered, changed the pad and got back to bed. Cramping stopped, felt so much better. Took another 2 misoprostol pills vaginally. Light cramping an hour latter. Fell asleep shortly after, next morning woke up feeling great.Would recommend getting a heating pad & having abortion in evening, that way you can relax in bed and sleep after it’s all over.

I was bleeding and  30 mins of this I felt relief instantly which I assumed meant I passed the pregnancy.

The cramping subsided dramatically and I felt much better while I was passing the clots. I believe my experience was better than most because of how early on I was which basically resulted in me not having a ton of tissue that I needed to expel from my uterus to begin with.

Long story short I caught my pregnancy really early to where there was no baby or gestational sac formed yet. So the process was VERY easy for my physically. I had very little cramping for 10 mins after the pills dissolved. And about 30mins to an hour I was bleeding with a lot of clots. As each day goes on the bleeding gets better well for me at least.

Please know that unless you have some strong medicine, you'll still feel the pain from the contractions. On the plus side, it'll only be pain that lasts for about 2 to 3 hours tops.

I want take some pain relievers but that was too late, when I swallowed them and I started to vomit immediately. I was pooping and vomiting, it felt like my body wanted to reject everything... the pain was non-stop for an hour and very heavy. It must have been similar to delivering a baby. In the second hour I noticed cycles: 2 mins pain, 2 mins pause, and after 2 hours of agony, the pain started to be less. After total 2.5 hours It was over... and I guess I was lucky...  The bood came only after 2,5 hours, a bit more than usual. I bet if I were waiting for nature to solve it, it would have been less painful.",Mira

I went online and read some forums saying it wasn’t too bad but when I spoke with friends that have done this, they said to do the Procedure because the pill is a bad experience. I wish I had listened to my friends. I inserted 4 pills at 12pm with bearable pain then another 4 pills inserted at 6pm. At 8pm I started to feel horrible cramps with some period like bleeding (I have heavy periods). Took 2 Tylenol. At 9 I was in excruciating pain. 12:20Am I felt something coming out the size of an orange. I bleed A LOT. My husband works in the medical field and said it looked normal and it’s what would’ve been taken out if I had the procedure. I felt like I was going to faint and laid down with bad pain and fell a sleep until 4am when I woke up soaked. No cramping. Put in new pad and it lasted 4 hrs until I changed. I have a follow up tomorrow.",Lee

They only gave me ibprofen, so my partner called the emergency room to get something else. I could walk, I was vomiting, I had a horrible fever, and it came in intense waves. The pain lasted from the morning all the way into the late afternoon.

NO PAIN AT ALL !!  On Nov 5th, I placed 2 Misoprostol tablets under my tongue and let them dissolve and 4 more  into my vagina shortly after. (I was a little over 6 weeks pregnant) Nothing happened immediately besides some severe chills about an hour after and the tablets did make my tongue tingle a little. The chills continued for about 3 hours off an on  with some diarrhea. After I passed the stools. I went to pee and some clots came out with some blood immediately (NO PAIN). I went back to bed. About 3 hours later a few more clots and blood but no heavy bleeding. On day 2 the bleeding is very minimal and still NO Intense pain.....a little cramp..... almost unnoticeable and that's it.

I had a D&C for a miscarriage a few years ago and found this process  much less invasive, pain levels were similar but this way was much easier to recover from and being comfortable in your own home meant a lot.  Cramping was more than your normal period and did get a little intense while passing but it was all bearable. After passing the cramps subsided and were comparable to period cramps. I found the pain levels after the D&C were actually a bit higher than this. I do recommend taking pain medication an hour before you take the misoprostol and keep on top of it as that will definitely help.  I laid down with a heating pad but made sure I got up every 30 mins or so to pee and stretch out.",Opal1

It is hard to describe the pain I felt 2.5 hours after having this inserted. The cramping started and was so aggressive it made me decide to never have natural birth. I was groaning so loudly in the Prep room they had to expedite my DNC process. I could not breathe properly because of the pain, I was sweating through my clothes so much so that they had to give me fluids through IV. I pleaded with my nurses and dr to give me more pain relief and begged god to make the pain go away. I prepped with 1000mg ibuprofen and this did nothing. I lost all feeling in my arms hands and fingers and went into a trance-like state. I honestly wish I had passed out because the pain was so intense.

The first experience I had with this medication was absolutely horrible. I was prescribed a decently strong painkiller, but I failed to take them until after I was already in a great amount of pain so didn't start working when I really needed them. This time I decided to not make the same mistake. Knowing that my body responds best with Aleve for period cramps, I decided to take two Aleve an hour before I let the 4 pills dissolve in my mouth and I’m SO HAPPY  I did. Yes the cramps were there but they weren’t as terrible as I remember them being the first time. I also took some ibuprofen and had a CBD patch - it was a breeze! I took the medication at 6:45, started bleeding at 7:05, and passed the pregnancy by 7:30. I have had mild bleeding and cramping but nothing worse than a heavy period.

Ever been so drunk you feel like poop & throw up?? The out of control sick feeling? It is that plus +period pain times X10. MY ADVICE: The nurses told me to take the pain Medicine (1 pill) an hour to 30 minutes before taking the 4 abortion pills. NOO. It takes over an hour for the pain medicine to kick in, YET the abortion medicine starts within 20-30 minutes. Take the recommended number of pain pills with a meal 2 hours before taking the 4 A-pills. Eat a meal with the pain meds so you don’t get sick from the pain meds (some people get sick from opioids, some don’t). You will feel high yes, but trust me the pain is literally unbearable.

My blood pressure dropped to 70/40 (dangerously low) and my heart rate was 135/min. I was in hypovolemic shock and got rushed into trauma and then to surgery to remove the remaining placental tissue from my uterus.

I was shaking and felt myself trying to vomit but I didn't let it happen bc I was afraid I would vomit the meds. After about 30min of agony I felt the urge to sit on the toilet. I passed 3 large clots & lots of blood that is when the pain minimized to normal period cramps. I fell asleep for a couple of hours and the bleeding continued along with the passing of smaller clots. I gave it a 10 because it works & its super convenient to be at home  but beg your doctor to prescribe you something stronger than ibuprofen for the beginning cramps because its unbearable!",Majesty
493,Misoprostol,Abortion,9.0,,"August 8, 2019",6,"I took my medication vaginally with mild discomfort. I think sitting upright and allowing your body to dispel was its way of saying it needs to be relieved through passing if you are in agony, which I was by the third hour.- Get a hot water bottle- Have someone present if possible- Have hot chocolate- Have Ibuprofen and do not exceed stated dose- If in doubt about the level of pain, try to use the toilet and see if symptoms resist- Buy TENA LADY pads, not period pads as this type of product acts like a really big sponge and is good for the environment :)Major note; I am from the UK and the medication is prescribed under our National Health Service (NHS) which allows patients to claim free medicationI wish any girls and women out there the best of luck to you.This isn't easy and I hope this really helps.Iamthatgirl xoxo",Iamthatgirl

I had visited the bathroom at least 5 times within those 4 hours. I started bleeding until 2 hours after taking the pills. Honestly the bleeding was exactly like a heavy period. My cramps just felt like bad period cramps. I didn’t take any pain medication and I didn’t use a heating pad. I was exactly 5 weeks when I took the pills. My doctor said that’s why my cramps weren’t as bad. The heavy bleeding stopped 24 hours later. I had normal period bleeding for a week and then light bleeding for another week.

Everyone is obviously different but it was so much better than I anticipated. I took the pills and got cramping while I kept them in for 25-30 minutes.

My cramping lasted about 10-15 minutes and then I fell asleep for 2 hours. When I woke up I didn’t have even blood on my pad so I was nervous it did not take but as soon as I stood up that’s when it started happening. It’s been about 5 hours since I took the pills and I’m completely fine. No cramping, nausea, or pain at all. Just like a SUPER heavy period.

I’m giving it a high rating because the process worked.  I was about 7.5 weeks when I miscarried so I passed some pretty large clots.

It is also expected that around 8 weeks and further you will see an actual fetus, which resembles a very tiny baby, and this my be far too much for many, and all of this I was not told. Second, ""severe cramping, similar to period cramps"" ummmm no, this was FARRR BEYOND that.  It was mild at first, just on and off cramps, but when my body started passing the pregnancy tissue there are no words to describe what I was feeling, and I was vomiting and having diarrhea all at the same time, it was awful for me.All in all this lasted 3 hours of bad pain, but it was in the privacy of my home bathroom, toilet and bathtub.",Ivana

So he said i have another option which will cost less. I was in 2 minds but then he told me to trust him so there he prescribed cytotec. He instructed me to insert 6 in my vagina and drink 3. When i got home i was still hesistant, then i went ahead because it was getting late. I took a shower and inserted at 9:45. About an hour later i felt slight cramps which lasted around and hour an them got worse. Not tooo major though so i took tramadol painkillers. Slept like a baby until 3 am, clotting began. Passed the fetus at 10 am an voila. Im good to go. Actual period now. Checkup in 2 days with my dr.",Nani27
