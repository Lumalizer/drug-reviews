0,Prednisone,Adrenocortical Insufficiency,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 22, 2017",5,"Three weeks after I delivered my third child, I went into an Addisonian Crisis, and diagnosed with Addison's Disease. I was in the hospital for two weeks, on multiple medications including IV steroids. I was discharged on prednisone. I felt like a new person! I felt 100% better. I wasn't sleeping all of the time, no more dizziness or fainting, and the pain was gone. I personally didn't experience any major side effects. This drug literally changed my life.",Kelsey F
1,Prednisone,Adrenocortical Insufficiency,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 11, 2014",11,"I was given 1mg for low cortisol. Took it first day ok. 2nd day in absolute rage all day plus agitated and literally ready to go into a mental home. Carried on for 2.5 weeks, on last day woke up with a headache, like my head was splitting open. Saturday, so set off to hospital. Thought I don't know how to get there. Rage and the headache are side effects of prednisone. Each time I take a dose of steroids, bone spur on another joint. ",Dismayed
