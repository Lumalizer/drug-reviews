0,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 30, 2022",6,"I am a mum, I work full-time, I study and I run a side business.  It was during Covid it all became too much and I fell into a giant hole of anxiety. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and OCD. I couldn’t eat, sleep or shower myself. I had intrusive thoughts on repeat all day long. After two failed attempts at meds and almost being admitted to hospital I decided to try the medication and stick with it. My GP started me on 50mg and after 4 weeks increased to 100mg. I remember saving the reviews that said it can take a while and would read them over and over. After 6 weeks on 100mg I increased to 125mg. My final increase was 8 weeks later to 150mg. I found each increase started to lift the fog. My intrusive thoughts started to fade. I started sleeping, got my appetite back and returned to work. 150mg is the right dose for me. I have been on Sertraline for 22 weeks and I am 95% back to myself. If you are starting the meds my advice is to keep going and be patient. It was a very slow process.",Rachaus
1,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 17, 2022",4,"I was on sertraline 37.5 my daily 9 years ago due to several back-to-back tragedies. My anxiety was off the charts. All I could do was sit in bed and stare at the wall while my mind raced, my heart beating through my chest, sweating, couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat. Sertraline saved me 9 years ago so much so that roughly a year ago a tapered off it. Big mistake. My anxiety recently returned almost as bad as before so just started 25mg daily and may increase to 37.5mg or 50mg if not seeing improvement at week 4. This treatment saved me 9 years ago so hoping it will save me again. I’m 45 years old and once I get my current anxiety under control I’ll be on it for the rest of my life. Folks that have never suffered through constant anxiety are blessed… lucky. Each time I count the hours until hopefully soon I can tell myself today I feel ok… today the world isn’t crashing down around me.  Today I feel like eating something. Hang in there everybody!",AnxiousCaliMan
2,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 14, 2022",1,I’m suffering horribly at the moment. My anxiety is so severe and I’m only taking 25mg. Everyone says it gets better.. I need it to.,Nomaticme
3,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 11, 2022",0,"Bad experience. Hi there I was on 25 mg to help cope with anxiety and depression as a result of heart complications from Covid. I would have occurrences where my heart rate would jump from 85 to 150 while sitting and BP skyrocketing over 200. I thought I was having heart attacks. I have heart inflammation from the virus. I am on heart meds as well, took some guesswork but I am managing this with cardiologist. The Sertraline made be feel so awful. I gave the appropriate amount of acclimation time, trust me. I was a zombie, couldn't do anything, stayed in bed with my tablet watching Amazon Prime and solving word games and drinking ginger ale. Had horrible nausea and headaches. It literally took the light out of my eyes. I am outgoing and like to exercise. I did NOTHING. I was on it for 10 nightmarish weeks. I started to lessen dose and stopped. I feel like a human being again.",Debbie
4,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 11, 2022",8,"My specialist recommended I start on Sertraline 50mg 5 years ago.  Two weeks in to this, my overthinking and anxiety got worse, so  I gave up.  Then a few months ago I wanted to try again so I did.  Started on 50mg then up to 100mg after 4 weeks.  I kept reading the patient literature saying it might take 6 weeks for full effect and some of the days felt very dark.  In the end it took me 12 weeks to feel the effects.  So be patient with this drug.  One day I just realised that I’m no longer having the anxious thoughts and I’ve now been consistently like that for a couple of months and it feels so good.  So my advice is stick with it.  The road to feeling the benefit may be bumpy and longer than the literature suggests  but for me the end result is worth it.",ART
5,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 7, 2022",5,"I was suffering with low mood anxiety and a slight amount of mania since stopping drinking alcohol in January this year. In retrospect I think this has been driving me on for years and years but it was just dropping alcohol that made me aware of just how up-and-down my mood were. I did an e consult and went to my local doctor and she put me on  50 mg of sertraline at first. She recommended that I only took half a tablet the first week but I kind of forgot and went straight onto 50 every day. I have had very few side-effects so far apart from thirst and slight increase bowel movement but nothing major. I did have one minor panic attack in the barber but I quickly passed and I think this is normal. This is the start of week two but I've been told not to expect any real stabilisation until week three. Things I have noticed so far on a more balanced mood, less anxiety, low ability to relax and more confident I'm not sure if this is just my mind playing tricks on me!",ModernJazz66

9,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 24, 2022",15,"I'm going to be completely honest here: the first month and each time increasing was absolutely the worst. The side effects of heightened anxiety are not for the faint of heart, especially if you are going on these drugs for this reason. BUT if you stick it through, which somehow I did, you get your life back. They saved me. I hope this helps anyone who needs to hear the truth when it comes to expectations. Of course some have no side effects, and some it doesn't work at all, but if you are having good days or moments periodically (initially, which I called my breakthrough moments) there's a good chance you'll come out the other side if you hang in there. This is not a quick fix or a miracle. Good luck. If I can do it, so can you.",Anonymous
10,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,,"February 20, 2022",5,I've suffered from severe PTSD and depression for many years due to my time as an Infantryman in the Army. I hid it really well with alcohol and avoidance/isolation. My poor wife missed out on many things in life because of me. This year one of my closest Army buddies killed themselves and then a month later another. It was time for me to get help before I ended up like them. My Psychologist at the VA put me on Sertraline and the first day I felt like I had a jet pack on flying around the moon. After a few days I had noticed I hadn't had any road rage incidents (a daily occurrence). Then after a week I slept the whole night and got 8 hours sleep which is something I haven't done in years. Things that would trigger me or set me off had zero effect on me and for the first time I felt like a normal person. The only side effect/downfall is the lack of sexual desire but who cares when I have my life back. The VA gave me Viagra for that...lol. Thank you Sertraline for saving my life!,Army Vet
11,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 18, 2022",2,"Hi all, I too want to share that I used to look here for hope that sertraline would work. I was convinced I would never get better, and this was terrifying. I couldn’t sleep and was in constant pain from anxiety. I would also enter phases of deep depression where I felt I couldn’t cope and I couldn’t look into the future. I started on 25mg. After 2 weeks my suicidal thoughts became stronger. This was distressing, as I wanted to live but couldn’t stop the thoughts. I felt trapped. My dose was increased to 100mg and then 150mg. After 6 weeks, I suddenly felt me again. I was honestly in shock. I was me again. I can function again. I still have a bit of anxiety but I can manage and work on my life now. I also took quitapine 25mg to sleep at night. This isn’t addictive and complements the ssri. If you’re living in a nightmare; like I was. Hang in there. You will get better. I promise.",Jw777

13,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 17, 2022",2,"I went through 3 or 4 months of being the most anxious/panicky I've ever been in my entire life. I started having panic attacks and that really knocked me on my butt. A combination of stresses that just boiled over. I started going to therapy and changed lifestyle habits. I then tried sertraline because I thought it couldn’t hurt to try. I had mild side effects the first couple weeks but they eventually subsided. I have been on it for about 6ish weeks now and can notice a difference. The medication helped put me in a place in which I could tackle my irrational anxiety without feeling overwhelmed. The medication helps but you must remember to put in the work to face your anxiety head on. So yeah I recommend the medication. I hope you know that even when you go through tough times, it won’t last forever. Take life as it comes. Be here now.",cdj
14,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 16, 2022",1,"Sertraline has worked well for my anxiety and especially well for intrusive thoughts. I started at a very low dose- 12.5 mg, and then increased by 12.5 mg every 2 weeks. This helped to alleviate side effects. Initially I felt very sleepy and a bit nauseous after taking but this did not last. I currently take 75 mg a day (also being treated for depression) and this dose is working fine. if I only needed for anxiety I'm sure I could take less. I've tried many SSRI's and SNRI's and this has been the best by far.",Jane
15,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 12, 2022",2,"This medication has absolutely changed my life. I have always suffered from anxiety mildly but since my stress levels increased I found myself breathless, heart pounding, vision impaired, loss of movement. I thought I was dying. Turns out these were signs of anxiety. My anxiety symptoms started to improve within days, I could live again. Around 2 months in I found myself having symptoms again and my doctor recommended me to go up to 75mg which has now stabilised and I am no longer having symptoms. If you are having doubts about this medication try it out, stick it out because it will change your life. You will be able to breathe again. Some of the side effects that I have found is tiredness and decreased sex drive (however both of these have subsided once stabilised).Good luck and if you are struggling right now please know you are not alone and that there is help out there including this medication.",Jane

In October I started to suffer from periods of anxiety, which expanded to the point I was suffering 24/7 by beginning of December, so I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, and eventually couldn't work anymore and got panic attacks. I've been taking 50mg from the start.- Week 1-2: Side effect hell, in bed all day, morning anxiety, better in the evenings;- Week 3: Better moments started earlier (afternoon);- Week 4-8: Ups and downs, this instability seemed to last forever, hope was fading;- Week 9: Started to work again, although I was not really feeling 100%;- Now: Finally I feel great again! Super happy last 3 days!No 'like a switch' moment for me, but a gradual fluctuating improvement. I had read about being patient, so I was. I saw my doctor every two weeks, and as I was experiencing some positive effects, he didn't want to up the dose prematurely.Hope this helps.",MikeBE

18,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,,,"February 5, 2022",12,"Hi all, I'm 53 and been battling anxiety since I was in my twenties it all started one day out of the blue with that dreaded feeling of fear and that things didn't make sense as if I was loosing my mind on top of shear panic, a dry throat, a tummy that was swishing around like a washing machine. To top it all off was that awful feeling of how frightened I was and that something awful was going to happen to me. So along came sertraline 50mg and my journey of getting my life back. These tablets are life savers but people treating anxiety has to start somewhere and won't happen over night, please stick with the programme you will most probably experience insomnia, headaches, trembling limbs, and a feeling of the worst panic and run away thoughts ever but after a couple of weeks you ""will"" start to see your sun shine again.",Anonymous

20,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 3, 2022",0,"I was on a low dose of Paroxetine and then Sertraline for depression and anxiety. I tried to get off of it when I was trying to get pregnant. I then went through a 5-6 month severe generalized anxiety. I finally got back on a high dose of Sertraline and the anxiety and brain fog gradually went away over a week or two. I wish I had never started this drug because every time I tried to get off of it the same thing would happen and it was torture. It was 100x worse than the anxiety and depression I had before I started any medications. It would have been nice if my Psychiatrist had suggested therapy and learning coping skills instead of immediately jumping to medication. I am getting better and better every day now from learning coping skills, CBT, meditation and listening to Podcasts of people who had severe anxiety and was able to recover. I highly recommend  The Anxiety Guy and The Anxiety Project podcasts. They have helped me tremendously. Good luck. You can overcome this.",Annie

I reached 150mg which is when I started NHS therapy (due to waiting list) and meds did help but I do believe it sub’d my problem that I wasn’t dealing with internally, which was an unhealthy and emotionally difficult relationship. The dosage continuously being increased helped me realise the meds stopped me being so emotional unstable but my mental health was not getting better (the doc advised after the next increase in dose they would need to look at alternative methods which made me scared I could not be helped) and something clicked I needed to deal with my lifestyle issues and change something, I wasn’t sure what it would be.

I had never really suffered from anxiety or depression before this year, when a Crohn's Disease flare from April-July caused a huge spike in stress & anxiety levels, to the point where I could hardly function & felt like a shell of my former positive happy self! The negative impact of the gut-brain axis was evident, I had intrusive thoughts, constant anxiety & every day felt like a struggle. I did not start taking sertraline without serious hesitation as I work within the holistic health world & was hoping the right diet & lifestyle choices would improve things. But eventually decided to start after speaking to my GP & reading EVERY positive review on here. Life couldn't continue the way it was & I'm so proud of myself that I took the proactive decision to start. Patience is KEY - it honestly took 7-8 weeks to take effect.

Along side talking therapy, I started taking 50mg of sertraline to combat inconsistent mood, anxiety and stress symptoms - both mental and physical. I cannot emphasise this enough - I HAD EVERY SIDE EFFECT and nearly stopped a number of times. I frantically called my dr and visited pharmacists in supermarkets to check that how I was feeling in the beginning was normal.

I didn’t want to be around or talk to anyone. So I decided to talk to my sister in law with what I was experiencing and she told me to try sertaline as she is on them,nd they have helped her after having a baby.  so I then talked to my Doctor. The first day I took it I was up all night my side effects were waking up early and not being able to go back to sleep, sex drive has changed, nausea, headache, dizziness and feeling like something was stuck in my throat. As 3 weeks past those symptoms have gone now I’m experiencing heart palpitations and random panic attacks. I’m currently onto week 4 now and I’m staying strong and hopefully get past this bad stage.

I was experiencing severe panic attacks every morning, anxiety and nausea constantly. My depression and anxiety was so bad that suicidal thoughts crept into my mind.  My doctor put me on sertraline.  The first week I was put on 25mg and the panic attacks were so severe.  I  felt so bad and the suicidal thoughts were worse.  My wife called the doctor and he said I must stick with it.  He referred me to the mental health crisis team who called me. They also told me I mustn’t come off it and it will work.  I felt bad for 2 weeks crying everyday. After 3 weeks something happened - I couldn’t cry anymore. The panic attacks started to reduce.  After about 6 weeks I started to feel more normal.  I was also put on Quetiapine as my anxiety was so severe.  After 2 months I went from being a wreck that could barely function to a happier normal person with no depression or anxiety.

When GP first suggested antidepressants after lifelong anxiety & previous CBT, my reaction was NO I don’t want to be on antidepressants & though I hadn’t even began taking them I was already worried as I knew they can be difficult to come off. 1st few days I felt truly awful. My body didn’t feel connected to my brain & I felt awful. BUT within 2 weeks I felt SO much better. anxiety massively eased, mood drastically improved & initial horrid feeling completely subsided. Only side effects I had were dry mouth for 1st few weeks (chew gum), struggled to orgasm for a few months (& decreased libido overall), very vivid dreams & some weight gain. I have stopped taking now due to improved M.H. Coming off was no where near as bad as I expected - just had to taper down very slowly. Would recommend trying to anyone - it gets better.",holly12345

I felt nauseous for the first week had disturbed sleep however after a few weeks my anxiety subsidised I was no longer dizzy or light headed , I was able to smile again and was back to my normal self.

Through therapy I started realizing I had some stuff to deal with, lol. I had lived with anxiety and depression for so long that I almost didn't realize I was doing so. I was self medicating (alcohol and food mostly). Sertraline has changed my life for the better. Yes, the first 3-4 weeks and side effects were a little rough (best described as being tired, anxious and zombie-like) but nothing too outrageous.

I am in my 6th week of 100mgs——I have had some good days but have yet to feel the day where everything looks so much better.  The pharmacists said it can take up to 8 weeks to feel better but since I wake at 4:30 am with high anxiety that stays with me most of the morning and part afternoon they advise me to change the time I take it , instead of breakfast to take it suppertime.  I just want to add that I do mindfulness meditation and that does relieve my anxiety——CBT as well .  I hope I will see the light at the end of this long dark tunnel.

I thought about not taking anymore but I did continue. I had no more stomach problems but the fogginess lasted a couple of weeks. However this was quite nice to feel out of it compared to the torture in my head before. The fogginess cleared after a couple of weeks and I feel generally more balanced and able to cope with life.

One of the most helpful impact of sertraline is that I can naturally smile again, just like a child. I can feel my heart beating like it did  when I was much younger. Also, I couldn't believe I've recovered better metabolism without workout or a strict diet. Although I eat less because of nausea, I can feel more distinct difference between being hungry and full. I guess it is a lack of keen sensation that caused binge eating for me.  Moreover, I started to have vivid dreams after some weeks of sertraline. It's been many years that I only had blur and faded dreams, although not as frightening as they were in my childhood. Now I seldom have nightmares.",Nie

I was able to ride it out this time and felt a lot better.

120,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 22, 2021",6,"These tablets are not a miracle cure but they helped bring my anxiety down to a manageable level and elevated me to a place where I could recognise my negative thought patterns as irrational. It was around 5-6 weeks before I started to feel a positive difference. Most of the worst side effects only lasted for a couple of weeks but the one thing that was persistent was slightly blunt emotions and a drop in libido. I'm not sexually active but masturbation suddenly felt like too much effort and I was never in the mood anymore. For most of the 2020 pandemic my mental health was surprisingly ok but I now realise I was probably ok because I was on those tablets. I've recently been prescribed sertraline again after I noticed some of my old negative thought patterns creeping back. I regret coming off the tablets when I did, the middle of a pandemic is not the time to come off your antidepressants",Liza

The beta blockers kept the panic attacks away but my anxiety got only slightly better after 2 months. The effect was minor and I was disappointed. I decided to stick to it anyway and finally saw an effect after 3 months. After 3 and a half months not only is my anxiety gone but I am able to deal beautifully with tough situations.

Both have helped my anxiety immensely. The only bad things I could personally point out is that this medication is habit-forming. Going cold turkey (even if for a few days) makes your anxiety increase ten fold. It also decreases sexual libido to the point where I’m never in the mood anymore and have mental/mood irritation when being sensually touched.,Alice

Blood pressure also restabilized.Side effects: some decrease in sexual drive and difficulty in achieving orgasm, but well worth it as sex has become more ""real"" and less ""escape,"" and orgasms far more powerful.

I took them for 2 months the first 3 weeks my anxiety skyrocketed so plan a few weeks off work if you plan to start.

I've always taken up to 50 mg in the past. Well to make long  story short the truth is since I started back I've been back and forth from 25mg to 50mg, to 75mg,  and then back to 50 mg cause of the bad side effects and  still not feeling myself.

After a major panic attack in particular I was in a seemingly permanent state of anxiety and depression. I wasn’t house-bound and remained high-functioning, but inside my head I was a wreck. Although medication is rare for me (I prefer natural alternatives and talk therapy), I felt that my struggle was significant enough that I needed something extra to boost my recovery. I worked with my doctor and he prescribed 25 mg of sertraline. 5 weeks later I am thrilled with how this lower dosage has positively impacted my mood and made me feel like I can tackle this adjustment process. While all of us hope for instant results, patience is critical. Sure there were good and bad days in those first few weeks (including several insomnia-induced sleeps) but I feel like sertraline was a critical tool to help in my recovery and worth what few side effects I experienced.",New to drugs

Also, I experienced a lump in my throat sensation, however after the third and fourth week, I started to feel better, and advice I would give is to take this pill religiously at the same time!!!!. There was a day in the third week where I took it later and the drawbacks were terrible including muscle spams and sensation that something was pulling my head upwards all the time.

Additionally, whenever I tried to fall asleep I would feel a falling sensation and hear a loud bang sound. I sweated profusely whenever I actually could sleep and woke up feeling absolutely terrible.

I probably should've started with something  like 12.5 mg, for two weeks and then bumped up the dose slowly. I want to caution others to be extremely careful with dosing - the experience can be traumatic if you do not titrate properly.

I stuck with the tablets with encouragement from family and friends. I'm very glad I did. I felt less anxious after about two weeks, and felt increasingly less anxious from thereon in. I wouldn't say this drug stops you experiencing blips, but you can put them in perspective and take things as they come without catastrophizing.

Now, in no way has this 100% fixed my entire life. Instead, what it helps you do is get past the initial panic of anxiety, and view things in a different perspective. I also have received counselling and with that gained tools that have helped me deal with my life. The first few days of taking this drug at 25mg, I felt almost euphoric. I had a constant, splitting headache for the first two weeks, decreased appetite and horrible cotton mouth. Two weeks in, I upped to 50mg and around that time most of the side effects went away. I found also, for me, that taking it at night was the most effective and I can finally fall asleep and stay asleep.I am now on 100mg of Zoloft once a day and have been on this dose for about nine months.

The first weekend my anxiety went into overdrive and I could not understand what was happening to me it led me to reckless drinking that weekend in a way I had never before done and I could understand why I was doing this either. I think the problem was although you on a pill my doctor never explained anything about this drug to me and just prescribed it with my antibiotics. Like most I read side effects to watch for but never realised it could heighten your anxiety in the first 2 weeks. It led me to a very dark place where I thought life wasn't worth living.

294,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,,"July 19, 2019",31,"Sertraline has helped me a lot with anxiety and some moderate depression. If you are very sensitive to SSRI's, like me, increase the dose very slowly to avoid bad side effects.  Get the Sertraline liquid 20 mg per millimeter.  Use a 1 ml oral syringe and start at 4 or 5 mgs.  Increase by 4 or 5 mg every 10 days or so.   Be patient, you will adjust and will start feeling better each week. Sensitive people can't take the ""recommended"" starting dose and increase jumps which is usually starting at 12.5 to 25 mgs and then jump up to 50 mg+.  This strategy is from a specialist doctor and will save you a needless suffering and wasted time.  You probably will still experience some side effects , but they will be more tolerable by ramping up slowly.Get a genetic test done  before you start taking medications.  The results will tell you which medications you can metabolize normally and which ones you can't, if any.  Gene mutations will cause increased side effects.",Been There Done That

I was reluctant to start sertraline but I did and I can honestly say that 6 weeks on 50mg setraline and I’m handling life in a calmer way. I think before acting now and don’t care so much about criticism and what people think about me. I can go out now and not worry about everything. I can go into a supermarket and not feel as if I am going mad with the noise and the people. I feel really good just by feeling calmer I can rationalise day to day things and people have noticed how less fidgety I am and easier to be around. The initial side effects lasted about a week. They were manageable .  Nothing is as bad as full blown anxiety and panic attacks,Jillyx99

I was first on escitalopram when I was 21 and that made me feel suicidal. I stayed on it for 2 years remarkable as it evened out but never helped me. Then finally relapsed and went on prozac which was a life changer for the first 12 years. I tried to come off after tapering and then got ill 6 months later. Doc put me on sertraline. First few weeks your symptoms will feel worse just remember this is how the medication works!. Now on week 4 I am starting to feel like my old self again. Still random appetite but I can feel the benefits. I guess I am so used to this illness I know there is always a light at the end of the tunnel.

It has really changed my quality of life and relationships and I feel that I am back in the world again. I care about people and places and doing things again. I no longer feel scared of things. I have noticed that I no longer feel the generalised anxiety when I leave the house.My job involves a lot of public speaking and I have managed this so much better too.

Never experienced anything like this before and I'm 38. I have a lot going on like having 3 young kids and financial stress. Decided to go to the doctor after a morning when I woke up and had an intense panic attack. She prescribed sertraline. Anxiety would come and go the 1st few weeks, and I would often wake up in the middle of the night. Appetite improved by 2nd week. Last anxiety attack was at the 2 week mark which was the 1st day the dose was upped to 100 mg. Anxious feelings seem to be getting less and less as the weeks have gone on, now on week 7. I'm much less stressed, overwhelmed, and I sleep well. I've also been reading books about anxiety which has helped. Every once in a while I feel a little anxiety welling up in my chest, but overall this drug has helped tremendously. I feel 'normal' again! Hang in there, it gets better.",Stevo

I promised myself I would comment once I was feeling better, because  reading these comments gave me reassurance when I was starting zoloft. I started having uncontrollable  panic attacks and anxiety after a mild electric shock at work.For me personally I had no positive effects for about 4 weeks,  then I was really up and down for the next 2 weeks where 1 day my anxiety would lower for periods than the next 2 days it would be back up. After around week 6 I started having longer periods of much lower anxiety but still anxiety would come on here and there. Now 8 weeks in anxiety is a lot less, still feel it from time to time but definitely feeling better. Hope this helps someone who is reading all the comments about people feeling better after a just a few weeks and thinking its taking too long so zoloft won't work. it does, just some of us take a little longer to feel the effects.

I feel like myself for the first time in years. Where I used to put off anxiety-inducing tasks e.g. phone calls for hours, days, or forever now I just do them without thinking.

The likely/common side effects are probably not going to be worse than what you’ve already been through (if your researching anti depressants then you have clearly been through a tough time). The unlikely/rare side effects are a tiny risk, however you take tiny risks constantly every day (like cooking, crossing the road, taking any kind of drug - almost everything can cause you harm). It’s exactly the same thing with starting a new medication. A risk assessment. Are the positives that I’m going to get from taking this going to out weight the potential negatives?

I was blown away by the positive change.  I was becoming more confident, comfortable with myself, &  above all enjoying life in general.  I still feel the ups & downs but I now respond rationally not with catastrophic fear.  The only concern I now have after being on 50 mg, for around 3 weeks is that I am experiencing incomplete orgasms.   Arousal is still there, but not the orgasm.  I am sad that this is a known side effect.  I am wondering it this side effect will pass as the body acclimates to the drug.

I would also say that the initial side effects which included insomnia have now abated and I feel good.  It has done wonders for me and I am only frustrated that for years doctors never gave me this option previously.,Ruperto
451,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,,"February 1, 2018",13,I’ve had really bad anxiety my whole life along with a hint of OCD during attacks and this was the first and only anti depressant I’ve been put on. It suppressed my diet for the first week but went to normal after that. My panic attacks feel less as extreme but still are there a little bit. They’ve become manageable which is the best they’ve ever been.  I’ve been taking this medication for 4 years (starting at 17) and have learned that you must take it very consistently (I use only 25mg) if you want results. This drug has honestly changed me for the better.,HailsC

I didn't find it lifted my depression so my doctor put me on 100 mg. and that just made me feel angry and still didn't help the depression so he took me back down to 50 mg. I want off this drug but when my doctor lowered the dose to 25mg. I had horrible anxiety attacks. I was already on anxiety medications and it didn't stop these heightened feelings of anxiety, so my doctor put me back up to 50mg. I want off. I think I feel worse than before I started taking it. But now will have to stabilize and then take smaller increments of decreased mg. to ween myself off. I don't advise this medicine. However, my identical twin takes 50mg. for years and she loves it!

The downsides are, that I'd wake up in a bad mood: feeling like I hadn't slept enough or that I'd dreamed too much, and It didn't really make any noticeable difference to my anxiety.",Kinsie

776,Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,3.0,,"May 9, 2009",24,"Zoloft (sertraline):I was having heavy stress associated with my job in healthcare billing. My anxiety would go through the roof and I would have horrible acid reflux when my heart started to race. My doctor pointed out that it was the stress that was causing these anxiety peaks and recommended I take Zoloft. I have been taking a 100mg dose in the mornings for the last 11 days. The first 2-3 days my stomach felt bad and I was very mellow, but soon after the symptoms started to go away . Now I only notice that I wake in the morning with my teeth clenched tightly for some reason. It doesn't really bother me too much. It's just a weird feeling that I have little control over.My stress has changed very little and I keep wondering if this medicine works.",Anonymous

I do take it in the morning so I do not have trouble sleeping. I do find that if I am tired during the day and want to take a nap, I can't sleep. The only other side effects so far are constant stomach upset and occasional diarrhea.  Hopefully these will subside, if not may have to switch to a different medicine.  Hopefully there will be no weight gain, as that would not be good.",Anonymous

Sure, my sex drive has decreased and my weight has increased, but I no longer feel like I'm falling apart at the seams, and I'm genuinely happy.

I also have a much more stable mood throughout my day.  It did cause me to gain weight when I started taking it, but I was not eating enough prior to taking the medicine.  Occasionally, I would get headaches and after a while my body started having panic attacks again.  But for the first year at least, I would say it was the perfect medication",Anonymous
