0,Paxil,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 15, 2021",7,"I’m not exactly sure of the day I started talking it, but it’s been at least 20 years. I started with 10 mg and at one point my anxiety got a little worse and my Dr suggested upping the dose, but I didn’t. When I  get anxious symptom my chest feels tight  and can’t get a full breath of air. At one point I also tried to stop but the situation that makes me anxious still there and my Dr said to continue taking it. I wanted to stop now because I was afraid of the long term effects, but I just read it’s pretty safe. I’ve never had any problems with it. I’ve always taken it at night but in the last week, I’ve started taking it in the morning. I feel fine. I eat more or less healthy and do exercise about 3x a week. I’m 70 and Paxil is the only drug I take besides my asthma inhaler. I’m actually a little fearful of stopping.",Renee
1,Paxil,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 22, 2021",2,"Been on paxil with Wellbutrin since early 2000. When I've tapered down below 10mg/day it usually ends up with me needing to up the dosage to 20mg for a while following which I tapered back to 10mg. At 10mg the sexual side effects are less troubling.  My doctor added a low dose of gabapentin to my daily paxil/Wellbutrin regime and it's been helpful.  All in all,  I'm very happy not to be the person I was before my anxiety/depression diagnosis when I started paxil.  Has it been life changing? Yes, and in a very good way. It just works for me.",Nickel56
2,Paxil,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2021",110,"I started taking paroxetine 10 mg 2 weeks ago, and I am so happy that I did because I feel like my self again.  I was on paroxetine 15 years ago due to a difficult time in my life.  I did go off of the medication after 8 years, and felt fine.  Back on it now due to some life stressors, and it has worked wonderful with my anxiety, panic episodes, and mild depression.  I had very minor side effects in the first 1 week.  So, I am so grateful for this medication because it truly has helped considerably, and I am hoping to see more results within the 4-6 week period.  Best Luck!",Leeh
3,Paxil,Anxiety and Stress,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 25, 2020",13,Paxil made me gain about 50 pounds so I got off it. It didn't even work that well for my anxiety. The withdrawal coming off it were a nightmare -  seriously - this drug is awful. My doctor said the weight gain is likely permanent :(,Doc

5,Paxil,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,,"January 25, 2020",21,"I have taken Paxil twice.  Once in my twenties and I'm currently on it again in my early 40s and for different reasons. Having gone through the withdrawal before I can tell you that it is difficult and you should not do it without being under the watchful eye of a dr.  My main side effect is sexual, which in my 20's worked well.  Now that I'm older, the delay in ejaculation is fine however the lack of feeling isn't great.  Normally, you can feel the semen rising up through your urethra but on Paxil you can't.  It still feels good to orgasm but not the same.  After I got off of it last time I became so sensitive that two thrusts and I would explode.  Not good for the ladies although my wife always said she didn't care.  At this point, my agreement with my dr. is that I'm going on the drug for a short period and will begin my tapering again soon.  I will say that this does keep me from getting aura migraines and it is wonderful not to have those.",Rotag
6,Paxil,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 8, 2020",23,"I just started a new job, all the stress turned into anxiety to the point I would get dizzy, heat strokes, and be close to passing out. My doctor started me with Praxil 20mg after a month increased my dose to 30mg once a day everyday. I also take Buspirone twice a day. I still have a personality and feel extremely better then a few months ago. Please be patient it takes a month to kick in -- side effects are minor and last for a week. Taking Praxil after lunch instead of the morning really helped manage the side effects. Hang in there everyone! Side Effects for first week1. Sleepy after taking 2. Blur vision3. Head aches 4. Increased appetite",MZaidi

8,Paxil,Anxiety and Stress,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 28, 2019",16,"Worst AD I have ever tried. The medication actually magnified my anxiety to the point of madness. My brain was out of control. Body pain, cramping, muscle tension, blurred vision, headache, severe back, spine and stomach pain. If you're a male, do not take Paxil. It will destroy you libido and as far as male working parts it will strip you of your manhood. Nothing will work if you're sexually active. This medication is awful. As soon as I stopped taking it the side effects disappeared. Doctors are over prescribing AD's. If you suffer from pain, they take you off pain meds and create a new of problems with AD's.",WJ

11,Paxil,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,,"October 15, 2019",37,"I started taking Paxil back in 2002 and I’ve been on/off it until I started to wean off it a few months ago - big mistake. I almost got off of it on my own pace (fast) but at the wrong time (too much stress, plus I was bringing up bad past experiences that triggered anxiety/stress in my life). Last Monday I had a hard time talking w/o feeling winded and shortness of breath, plus I was tense all over and I lost interest in everything. Now I’m back on it at a low dose (7.5mg (cut) but need to go back up to 20 or 30mg. 30mg was my long term dose). I tried Viibryd for a day but diarrhea sucked so no thanks. Figured I should just stick with what worked. I can honestly say I really miss not having to go through this as we all are. I’m definitely looking forward to the day when I can be normal again like this never happened. Now it’s repair time - brain work. Gotta get some positive mindfulness books. Stay positive as much as you can. Whatever helps for the moment. One day at a time.",NicVall

I tried the prescription, and I thought I was dying.  I had the most horrible allergic reaction.  I couldn't breathe and my heart was racing.  He told me that I was having an anxiety attack.  He's determined to keep pushing this on me and is threatening me to remove me off diazepam.  Never had problems with diazepam.  I told him I'm not depressed but he's insisting I am and insisting I have anxiety.",Lin
13,Paxil,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 20, 2019",84,"I started taking paxil back in 1996 and it was the greatest drug it help me get thru my depression and anxiety and it gave me my life back. Now I am 60 I slowly got off pazil for 6 months now my troubles are back. I am going back on my Paxil because with out it I can't live a normal day. I am slowing letting Paxil back into my system. I need this drug so I can live a normal life. I hope this helps everyone, but everyone system is different. I have tried other ones but never worked as good a Paxil. I'll never go off it again, its my life saver. Good luck but I know Paxil is really worth trying, but to avoid the side effects slowly take them to get back into your system. I wish I had never been taken off Paxil as it is my life saving drug. Thank you Paxil for giving my life back. God Bless you",young421

I slept non stop for 7 weeks while on it and in three months I gained massive weight (15 pounds) and, although I have been off it for 2 years, I cannot get rid of this excessive weight I gained while on Paxil!

Before Paxil I started having anger outburst over stupid stuff, hot to cold really quick and verbally assault people. My sleeping patterns were terrible which didn't help. If I drank alcohol I'd turn into the Incredible Hulk!  On the Paxil I'm a chill dude now, the only thing that I don't like is that it makes me a little too chill and I find myself shaking if off but maybe after another week or so I'll better adjust.

First time it worked within a few days, had some side effects, but helped with my panic attacks and anxiety. I felt better after a couple of months, so I got off. So now, I'm having bad anxiety again, along with panic attacks. My Doctor put me back on Paxil at 5mg for 2 weeks, then wants me to increase to 10. This time, really bad side effects, dizziness, and panic attacks are worse than ever after taking for 5 days.

19,Paxil,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,,"July 5, 2018",25,"I started taking Paxil 3 years ago.  I was changing jobs after 20 years, had a second child and my wife and I were no longer close.  I was angry and stressed out all the time and started having euphoric dizzy sensations so I was put on 20mg.  What a life changer!  I started to notice that the small things didn't bother me anymore and a lot of the big things were manageable.  I still got the dizzy sensations, but slowly over the next year, they went away. I'm 6'4"" and weighed 250lbs. when I started taking and  now weigh 300lb now.  I definitely suffered from weight gain.  Also, if you miss taking one, you know it.  That sucks.   Take it at the same time every night.  It evened everything out.  I take it before bed, as I wasn't sure if it would make me tired or not.  Also, as an occasional beer drinker, after one I get REALLY sleepy.Despite these effects Paxil has worked great for me.  Would recommend.",JD
20,Paxil,Anxiety and Stress,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 7, 2018",12,"Hi,I have been on Paxil for over three months. I stopped taking it 2 weeks ago (cold turkey) and since then, I am dealing with the withdrawal effects. I experienced brain zaps, vertigo, severe anxiety like I never had before. Although the medication worked instantly at first, it stopped working it (anxiety was worse than pre-medication intake) and this is the reason I stopped taking it.In these 3 months, I gained 30 (THIRTY) pounds and I am still gaining despite the fact that I have been off it for two weeks now. Before taking them, I was 100 pounds. I have  flu-like symptoms including severe sinus infection, dizziness, headache, lack of appetite, etc. Not worth taking it. If it doesn't fix the problem, what is the purpose for taking it?! If you absolutely have to take SSRIs, consider other medication that has less side effects. Coming off of it...is awful. Worst possible side effects.",Martha

A pound for every mg. and it wont come off no matter what I do to exercise and eat right.2- PRO: I like life again.3 - CON: dosage increases every few years due to either getting used to it, or the weight gain due to the meds.. a vicious circle.",vansa

I always thought Paxil was for crazy people. I used to always be on edge, worry about EVERYTHING, have chest and neck pain from stress, and was generally unhappy. Since I have been on Paxil I feel like I can live again and I even lost weight. I am in school for my RN and I don’t get angry and stressed about every little thing that doesn’t go my way. It is like my mind and body won’t let me sweat the small stuff. My relationship with my spouse is even better. I haven’t really experienced any negative side effects. Thank goodness for Paxil and my new life!! I couldn’t be happier!",V
23,Paxil,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,,"March 10, 2018",85,"I'm writing this because I was initially scared to start taking Paxil after reading a lot of negative reviews online, and I wanted to put a positive one out there. I'm currently on week 6 day 2, on a 10mg dose (I'm a small female). When I started, I had gone over a month barely eating or sleeping, and had lost over 15 pounds in the previous few months due to anxiety/depression. I was struggling with every aspect of my life, and felt like I didn't have the strength to pull myself through it. Today I feel strong, capable, I have my appetite back and my sleep has improved. I am back to my real joyful self and not just a shell of a person. The only side effects I have experienced are exhaustion in the first few weeks, and some jaw clenching at night. All manageable.So, if you're considering Paxil, don't be scared by all the info out there. Every body is different, and you never know: it might be just what you need to help you through this time in your life and find yourself.",Lolo

I did gain weight but that’s also cause I was not so stressed about being thin , when I do exercise I am super fit .  Paxil works , orgasms were harder but by no means impossible, just takes longer . I feel normal on it , went off for six weeks and there were mild side effects but nothing crazy . Had to go back on as there was a major trauma that happened while I was off them and I crumbled .

I tried Zoloft and Lexapro and both made me feel worse. January 2015 I started Paxil 10mg and worked up to 20mg and honestly felt like my old self again, no longer dealt with the attacks. However, in February 2017 I decided to try Prozac because the Paxil had made me numb to everything and I did gain about 45lbs on it. I have now  been on Prozac for almost 3 months and am waiting to switch back over to the paxil because I feel anxious and irritable on this and miss the paxil.

I suffered from lifelong depression and anxiety and can attest that Paxil probably saved my life as I contemplated suicide seriously on multiple occasions before taking the drug.It's good about 100% for depression, maybe 75% effective against Anxiety.

31,Paxil,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,,"March 28, 2017",14,"I used to be on 20mg Aropax for 7 years for my Borderline personality Disorder, Social Anxiety, Anxiety and Depression. I use to self harm and not be happy. I was always hospitalised and going down a destructive road. Other medicines made me worse like cipramil, Zoloft and Valium. Aropax did not make me 100% cured but help me deal with everyday issues better I still find that you need to practise mindfulness techniques and practice Cognitive Behaviour Therapy. This drug is only if you have severe depression and anxiety and find it difficult to use standard coping skills.

Writing about an experience that is short of something you would see in an exorcism movie (head spinning, projectile vomiting, sweating, hyperventilating etc.) Be careful. You are posting in a forum of people who have diagnosed anxiety and they turn to the Internet and read these posts, that more than likely are exaggerated, breeding greater anxiety or worse making someone not take the medication.

I have been reduced to 10 mg's from 20 and have been enjoying that but noticed that my mind fluctuates between optimism and pessimism really quite quickly.  The mind is a strange thing.  Anyway, it keeps me grounded, no panic attacks, no anxiety.  Amazing how we all react so differently to these various SSRI's.  Pity about the sex drive with Paxil.
