0,Citalopram,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,,"March 27, 2022",0,"Citalopram helped me so much during a hard season in my life. I was so hesitant in taking an antidepressant cause I knew I wasn’t depressed but I had a situation happen that caused my anxiety to sky rocket like never before . I had racing thoughts , pounding heart and couldn’t sleep . I took 20mg of citalopram for 5 years . All my racing thoughts were gone and no pounding heart and I could finally sleep !! Recently I have had a flare up again and went up to 30mg and have relief once again . Thank you Lord for making this medicine to help us out in hard times . Don’t be scared to try it . It does take along time to work but once it’s in your system you are so good . There is nothing wrong taking meds for mental health . They don’t change your personality and are non-addictive . There is one right one out there for everyone .",Anonymous
1,Citalopram,Anxiety and Stress,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2022",0,"Celexa (citalopram):I started having really bad panic attacks a few weeks ago for absolutely no reason. It kept getting worse and worse, I wasn’t sleeping, and I ended up in the emergency room several times and I was given a prescription for was 10mg Celexa (citalopram) tablets and was instructed to take them at night before bed with a snack. That’s what I did, and roughly 40 minutes after I started panicking worse than ever before. I could barely stand, my vision was blurry and trailing, ears rang super loud. I shook like crazy. I only got an hour of sleep that night. The next night when I took it again, I didn’t have any panic but my head felt weird as anything. This has been my second day on it so far. My whole body feels numb, my head feels distant and I can’t remember anything, it’s hard to breathe, and my muscles ache and burn. My vision is currently messed up and I feel weird as anything. I don’t know how you all stuck through it but I’m stopping it. I can’t do it.",Cody
2,Citalopram,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 15, 2022",0,I'm 40 and started to have severe anxiety which was leading to depression.  I felt uncomfortable in my own skin and didn't want to leave my house.  I found it extremely difficult to work a full day and after work just wanted to lay in bed.  I ignored phone calls quite often as I just didn't feel good.  I started on 10mg of Celexa.  The first 1.5weeks were AWFUL.  I felt so restless and this tingly feeling in my teeth and overall weird / lightheaded feeling.  I had to take time off of work during this period.  I slowly increased my dose to 20mg over a 3 week period. Now I'm on week 5 and taking 20mg at night.  Now I'm back to my happy self.  My energy is back to normal.  More more social anxiety and wanting to avoid people.  I'm so happy I tried this medication.  Stick in there.  It's uphill after the first 2 weeks.,DeltaT
3,Citalopram,Anxiety and Stress,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 7, 2022",1,"Celexa (citalopram):At the beginning of this year, I started experiencing severe depression and anxiety. I went on Celexa about 4, almost 5 weeks ago (20 mg). So far, I don't notice any improvement in my anxiety. I am concerned that the medication is adding to my anxiety, but am going to keep taking it because I heard it can take up to 6-8 weeks to kick in. Really hoping that will be my case. My symptoms lately have been anxiousness, chest tightness, loss of appetite, sweating/nervousness...and again I'm not sure if these symptoms have been influenced by the Celexa or not. I'm assuming the best thing to do is keep pushing through and I may be a case where it can take 2 whole months to kick in.",reviewer123
4,Citalopram,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 16, 2022",0,I love Celexa. I’ve had anxiety and panic attacks when I was young and xanax helped tremendously. But at 75 yrs I  started having spells with trying to speak without stammering. I thought I was having TIAs but my Dr thought it was stress. I haven’t had a single spell in a year since Celexa. And I’m not anxious in social situations. It’s been  wonderful for me.,mama diva
5,Citalopram,Anxiety and Stress,4.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 11, 2022",0,"Celexa (citalopram):I took Celexa for a few months about 4 years ago for a couple of months while experiencing extreme depression and anxiety. It seemed to help for a few weeks and then stopped. For a few weeks I had more motivation than usual and less depression and anxiety. It's the only anti-depressant I've taken that didn't cause extremely severe side effects.  I started again six months ago and it is doing absolutely nothing for my depression or anxiety, I just feel tired all the time and my depression and anxiety are getting worse every month. I've been having suicidal feelings for the last two months. The only side effect that has been consistent both times I've taken it is excessive sweating.... and I mean a ridiculous amount of sweating. If I exert myself at all I am dripping in sweat. Sometimes the night sweats are so bad I have to wash my sheets when I wake up because I'm soaked from head to toe.",xfreespirit79x
6,Citalopram,Anxiety and Stress,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 10, 2022",0,"I have been anxious since childhood. In my late 20s after having children I had severe panic attacks and was finally prescribed Prozac. Years later, I switched to Celexa because it has fewer side effects and felt like my problems were cured! I was on 40 MG for at least 10 years, and added Wellbutrin to counteract the sexual side effects. Went along happily for another 10 years but lowered my Celexa down to 20 MG a few years ago. I have noticed a few panic attacks slip in since then, but about 10 days ago I had a really bad attack and decided to go to my doctor. We increased my Celexa back up to 40 mg and he gave me a few 1mg Lorazepam for the really rough patches. However, I am basically unable to function right now. I can barely eat and the panic and anxiety are debilitating as soon as the Lorazepam wears off. I've been on the increased dose for 9 days now. Will it get better? I want my life back!!! I have a brand new granddaughter  and a great job and I just want to be me again.",Lolo

Made me very sleepy at first and weird runny issues like couldn’t go number 2 for ages. Have issues now with sexual dysfunction, I can’t orgasm no matter what. It seems to have played havoc with my skin and my metabolism too…like I was always very slim and now, despite being active and working out very regularly, I have slowly gained a lot of weight.

8,Citalopram,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 1, 2022",4,"This is the third time I’ve been on Citalopram since 2009. Each time I stayed on it for a few years. I’ve been suffering with anxiety for 24 years. Citalopram is fantastic at stopping panic attacks. I’m the kind of person who doesn’t like the idea of taking drugs and always come off it believing there are more natural ways to keep anxiety at bay. So when I started having panic attacks 24 years ago, like many people it was a living nightmare. I didn’t know what was happening to me and thought it was the end and would never recover. Anyway I always end up on it because of my bad lifestyle, drinking to much alcohol, eating crap and not exercising. When I do look after my self it does keep the anxiety at bay. Each time I go back on it I go through all the terrible side effects, which last a few weeks. I’d like to conclude, If you look after your self and take Citalopram, life can be great! I mostly take 20mg.",Shaun
9,Citalopram,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 27, 2022",3,"Celexa (citalopram):This has helped me with anxiety, depression, and OCD. The only regret I have is not taking it sooner. Absolutely life changing med. If you have side effects stick with it for a few weeks. I noticed my depression lessen within a week and three months in now I have zero anxiety or racing thoughts. OCD is all vanished. This should be your first line med for panic, anxiety, depression. I would never recommend benzodiazepines over this they end up exacerbating anxiety and are physically bad for you.",Eddie
10,Citalopram,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 16, 2022",3,"Celexa (citalopram):I suffered a massive left side hemorrhagic stroke 15 months ago.  While I have recovered almost completely from a physical perspective I was left with crippling anxiety.  I was in a constant state of fight or flight and often felt like I was going to pass out, I felt like it was a side-effect from the stroke that I was just going to have to accept and live with and I also felt bad complaining about it because I should be happy to still be alive.  I eventually mentioned it to my Doctor and she immediately made me feel better and told me we would work to fix it.  She started me on celexa 10mg x 10 days and then increased to 20mg daily.  The first couple of weeks were rough (jumpy, foggy) but after 2 weeks the side-effects subsided.  The 6-8 week mark was when I really noticed how much better I feel, almost no anxiety at all and I feel so much better.  I am so happy I was prescribed this medication.",SisterSami
11,Citalopram,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 9, 2022",0,I take citalopram because of my anxiety around sick. Feeling anxious being being sick was a constant before taking citalopram and now it barely crosses my mind and I never thought that I would get to that point. I feel back to my old self again and it’s such a freeing feeling as I am able to do anything now without having the constant anxiety. At first I was nervous to take it as one of the side effects is feeling/ being sick but I had no side effects what’s so ever and started to feel better within a week! I only take 10mg but that has fixed me! I honestly am so thankful for how it has made me feel and that I can return so enjoying life again.,Anonymous

I’m in week 7 and they have only JUST started to kick in. I had many manyyyyy days thinking when will I ever get better, is this really as good as it gets? Do I need to change meds? Shall I up my dose? When are the negative intrusive thoughts about death going to end! It was such a difficult time and the tablets increased my anxiety, black intrusives, for 7 weeks straight. I was so close to giving up but I thought I may as well continue I’ve come this far. A lot of stuff I have read says 2 months until effectiveness. Please trust me when I say this, give it two months. No less. They take so long to start doing their job do not give up, because once they do, you will feel back in the real world again. Im still on a journey for sure, I still get a bit disconnected sometimes and anxious, but I feel something great now. BE patient. Oh and the side effects are horrific but so worth it!!

Anyways my (now ex) Dr. Suddenly stopped refilling it one day a few months ago. Stopped cold turkey out of nowhere for no explanation. After a few weeks my life spiralled out of control. It's been a nightmare. Pain, weakness, fatigue horrible outrageous mood swings, thoughts of suicide and self harm. A literal nightmare. This med works but do not just stop taking it. And if your Doctor just takes you off it cold turkey without any reason as to why... Get a second opinion or ask questions.

I think the way my life has gone I will always succumb to reaching out for these meds if something emotional is hits my life, however I suppose though that isn't a bad thing. As they literally salvage your sanity and keep you on track, the anxiety this time around kept me awake for 4 days!!  On both occasions they have worked instantly from the first administration, I'm only on day 2 regarding this second experience, and although not fully back to where I was I can notice a large improvement..

The only side effects I had were during the first week and those were feeling chest pressure and jitters when I first woke up. Within 30-45 minutes they were gone. That only happened a few days and now I don’t notice anything. I had one day I would consider ‘bad’, very irritable, wanting to cry from being overwhelmed and jitters but after an hour it went away. It didn’t linger at all like it had been. I’m on 20 mg and I started out at this dose too. So far it seems to be just what I needed. I’m now looking forward to the next day instead of going to bed with dread about what was going to bother me. It may not work for everyone but it has me and I’m very thankful.",Ashley

26,Citalopram,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 19, 2021",1,"Hi,  I was just posting as over the last week I’ve spent hours on this Forum and a lot of the posts have helped. I first went on Citalopram to deal with racing thoughts and low level anxiety that is probably work / stress related.  After three days of taking 10 mg the effects were horrendous.  My anxiety went through the roof and I started to have panic attacks, my mind was going at a million miles per hour.  I couldn’t sleep ( though the doctor gave me sleeping pills after I called them back after two days, which took the edge off). I thought taking the tablet was the stupidest mistake I’d ever made.Fortunately this started to calm down around day 5. I’m now on day 8 and the panic attacks have stopped.  The anxiety is now noticeably less than before I took the first tablet and given they take a fewweeks to work properly,  I’m quite looking forward the the results over the next few days.",A1A1

My anxiety, night terrors, nightmares, the feeling in my chest of needles, the crying, the repetitive negative thoughts, the aggression, the sudden onset of anger, I was an absolute functional terror. Everything to me was so intense, all of my feelings; the intensity I could not handle. First dose and I felt better, just 10mg. I felt a wave of just ""ahhh"" wash over me within an hour of the first dose. I felt free. Side effects? I went from sleeping 4-5 hours a night to a full 8. Appetite improved and is more balanced. I take mine in the morning every day prior to work and it has helped me be better at my job, which is taking care of disabled people. The job ate me up with stress and now I don't dread going every day - I can clearly understand that this is my role and I am important. I'm not so grouchy or quick to anger anymore.

I felt great the couple weeks on the medication but I did have nights where I'd wake up wide awake in the middle of the night with my heart racing and in a deep panic, which has happened a few times. I smoke marijuana to keep my calm but sometimes it does the complete opposite. I'm thinking that drinking plays a huge part in any side effects worsening as I do drink a little heavier on weekends than I do on weekdays. Usually would have 2-3 bottles of beer a night but since I've started this medication there has been a lot of family events that I've had to attend and alcohol ends up being consumed.",healthanxiety-

I did have some shaking, vomiting, a fast heart rate and insomnia at first.  I tried to drink coffee the morning after taking it (I drink coffee every morning) and had a horrible reaction.  I stuck with it and just reminded myself to breathe.  After about a week my symptoms cleared up.  I feel much better now and I am also able to sleep much better now that I take Citalopram.

I tried everything before trying medication because I was definitely hesitant, but I’m really glad I tried it. It’s now been over two months and I feel a lot better. I don’t worry about having to leave a situation because of a break down anymore and I get less panic and can brush off intrusive thoughts.

This was more prevalent during the night which disturbed my sleep. I was sent to physios, chiropractors, rheumatologists, and acupuncture sessions to try and resolved this unexplained pain which was getting progressively worse.

I refused to take antidepressants for so long thinking I could handle it but sometimes it’s a bit too much as you need balance in your own mind.  So it’s now the 2nd day on citalopram 10mg I have noticed I have been yawning a lot, don’t feel nausea as of yet anxiety hasn’t changed a little more tired than usual but that’s probably due to the stress but it’s only early days. I will keep you guys posted for the people who want to take it.

I have been so low, upset and couldn't see how to pick myself up regardless of what I tried. I couldn't just keep coping day to day, I was a misery. I started on  citalopram 5mg then after 6 days went to 10mg and then finally to 20mg. It has been 4 months now. My message to you is: Hang in there!! The side effects are grim yes, yawning, headaches, increased anxiety and a bit of an upset stomach but they honestly pass and settle. I have no side effects now. Compared to how I felt, they were manageable and I didn't need time off work.The difference is night and day. It's like a lead weight has been lifted off my shoulders. It's cleared my daily migraines. I no longer have panic attacks, it hasn't effected my mental state or made me emotionless. I genuinely feel happier and calmer in myself, just my lows aren't as low. I have been getting out more, exercising, taking pride in things again. The difference is amazing.",Calm

I simply couldn’t increase the mirtazapine horrible side effects so I asked about adding citalopram. I’m super sensitive to meds so went really slow. Headaches, GI upset and increased anxiety.

I do find I haven’t been having panic attacks this last week they usually happen every day. I take half a pill of 20mg (so I take 10mg) right before I go to bed so I’m not as tired but I do find it harder to wake up and sometimes if I wake up during the night I felt really dizzy and disassociated. I felt really sedated and just weird I had never felt like that before. Sometimes if I take it too late like 1am (before I sleep) I'll feel awful especially if I have to get up and go to work early. But later in the day I feel great. I’m too scared to take the pill earlier cause I don’t wanna have a panic attack over the side effects I’d rather just sleep through them.,Gem

I struggled with sleep and concentration, and had brain fog. Additionally, getting off the medication has similar symptoms for about 2-3 weeks for me. In my opinion, it is worth those couple weeks for my years of relief on this medication.

She diagnosed me with general anxiety and suggested Citalopram. She told me it was indicated for depression, but off label use for anxiety was used as well. I trust my PCP. She prescribed me 20mg.  I waited 3 weeks before taking any because I was afraid.  When I started, I felt nothing for the first 2 or 3 weeks.  Then slowly, day by day, I felt the cloud lifting over my head.  I started to regain traction. My breathing slowed, my blood pressure lowered. I slept at night.  I spent more time with my kids. Don't be afraid to be put on this medication.

The vast majority of people will, if they can ride out the first couple of weeks,  find it gets much easier. I started at 10 mg for a period of 3 months.

Been on 6 months.  Its really amazing.  Sadness (depression) completely gone.  General anxiety gone.  When situational stress occurs it feels lesser and tolerable.  The truth is the medicine blocks emotional or physcological pain.  It probably blocks super emotional highs also but its an easy trade.  Side effects are appetite increase (because you are happy and not anxious) occasional night sweats sleeping, delayed orgasm but good if you had premature orgasm issue.

Eat before taking them, bananas I found easy to eat when side effects took my hunger ,  if you have to up dose I bought a pill cutter and went up 2.5 mg at a time so now on 20 mg and getting there , please keep at it and good luck to all x",Please keep at it ....

Back when I first was suffering from a lot of anxiety, we had tried this before I tried xanax, which helped a TON more (long off the xanax, on a longer lasting medication now). ANYWAYS, I tried this, took a pill before my 530am shift, went into work, and turned into a zombie. lost ALL feeling of emotions, was rude to the customers, literally turned into another person. called the doctor in 2 weeks and said get me in NOW. After 4 days i threw out the bottle, saw the doctor and tried the xanax instead. Celexa made my anxiety 2000000x worse. I'm someone with constant anxiety issues, but antidepressants like SSRI's and SNRI's make my brain freak out. I'd throw these out & let the trash enjoy it",Anonymous

It's a lot easier to use the strategies that my psychologist talks about. However, a warning must be given. Celexa has not been a 'magic bullet'. I still have to do a lot of work to not be anxious. However, it has helped me so much that I can't think about quitting any time soon.",Anonymous
