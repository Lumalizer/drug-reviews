0,Venlafaxine,Anxiety and Stress,6.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 3, 2022",3,"Please remember that everyone is different and their bodies respond differently. Don't always take negative reviews as gospel as you never know how the drug will work out for you unless you try it. I started off using Prozac ( Fluoxetine) but didn't get on with the drug. I then tried Zoloft (Sertraline) but I didn't get on with this either as it increased my anxiety.I then tried a different class of medication, Venlafaxine (Efexor). I started off on the low side with 37.5mg instant release tabs. I had a small positive response so my doctor upped my dosage to the 75mg slow related tabs. I felt after a few weeks but this was short lived so my dosage was then upped to 150mg and then upped again to 225mg where I stayed for about 6 months. I was in a stable place, not bad but not fantastic, more stable. Then  it stopped working. Back down to 150mg and added 15mg Mirtazapine at night. On second day and I've had no crazy withdrawals like some people experience, just a bit tired.",Luis
1,Venlafaxine,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 13, 2022",1,"When I tried this medicine 10 years ago it was a miracle drug for me. Literally alive because of it. I got GAD and more on. I'd tried many many SSRI's before but none of them worked at all, not before this one who works on two receptors. Always been sceptic for trying antidepressant, but this gave my life back. It was not easy to get off though. Recently I started this same medication again because I'm back in quite a depressive state of mind, the feeling of being high is an unpleasant high for me, like an really unpleasant ecstasy drug like feeling, but it wears off after a week or so. Bad stomach and shaky hands comes with and seems to stay. Been on 75mg for awhile and will go up to 150mg soon. Hopefully it will drag me up from the black hole once again. Won't recommend this drug generally to everyone because some people get worse of it also. Like all ssri/ssrni it works individually, you just have to find the right one for you.",Venlafaxine

3,Venlafaxine,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 12, 2022",3,"Have suffered horrendous anxiety for years.  Tried every type of medication to no avail I  currently take propranolol to help heart rate and shakes but had bad few years where even this wasn't helping.Was put on mirtazapine (highest dose) for a year, this only helped my appetite so I then became house bound with agoraphobia.I was at wits end until I was given 75mg twice daily of venlafaxine.Now at first the side affects were nasty, very nasty.  I'd feel extremely nauseous, yawn every minute followed by gagging sensations and completely loose my appetite. Also when I went to bed I'd shake, sweat and feel very agitated.This lasted for about 2 weeks and then all of a sudden they disappear and I feel amazing.  Nerves haves gone and I honestly feel like a new man.  I don't even have brain fog anymore.  It's like somebody went into my body and took control.  Best drug everHighly recommended for anxiety and depression",Mike87
4,Venlafaxine,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 8, 2022",3,"I can confidently say this medicine truly works wonders!! I am a 31 year old female and struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a child. I was put on a number of different anti depressants before that I found the side effects to be extremely uncomfortable and either didn’t stick with the medicine or felt numb. After being put on venlafaxine 6 months post-partum I can honestly say I feel so good. My anxiety has completely diminished. The strongest benefit though is the ability to think clearly, manage stress and still sleep wonders. I take two 37.5mg every morning with breakfast and find it is the perfect dose and time of day. The first 10 days adjusting to the medicine I felt a little bit brain zappy and minor headaches / fatigue but that quickly subsided and now 3 months in I feel awesome. I do suggest taking this everyday or you will feel groggy or foggy if you miss a dose. I too was weary of some of the 1 star reviews but I can honestly say I give this medicine 5 stars!!!",Ken
5,Venlafaxine,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 8, 2021",15,"I had been through every depression med there is and finally, finally one worked for me,v enlafaxine.  It is not an immediate miracle pill, it takes weeks to work into your system, so give it a chance because it could change your life, it did mine. Also,I didnt have all those negative side effects everyone is talking about, guess it just depends on your body. But trust me stick with this one, you'll be better soon!!!

At 75mg it was barely noticeable. Not helpful.At 150mg it started having an anti-depressant effect. But I was very apathetic. Still anxious and having problems. I started waking up at night and sweating/feeling really sick. The sickness went away when I took my next dose. I switched to a different drug.,SSRIs Not 4 Me

It was good , especially for sleep BUT, it eventually stopped working ! Changed over gradually to venlafaxine and it’s been amazing ! 37.5mg twice a day !  Got the usual nausea , only at first , and I still  get vivid dreams ( but NOT nightmares) . I used to be absolutely terrified and anxious  of flying and that fear has totally gone! ….Side effects ?

Then about 3 months ago, I could tell my nerves were getting out of control. My doctor recommended Venlafaxine 37.5 mg. The first couple of weeks, I had extreme nausea. Now, I have no night sweats or nausea. I function so much better. I am reading books a little bit better now, and I have a little more energy. I no longer plop on my sofa after work until bedtime. I have begun to tell that the dosage wears off, about 2-3 hours before my scheduled time to take it. My doctor has upped my dosage.

I decided to not do any research into it and just go in. It did help my anxiety,  but as I continued to take it my depression kept increasing. It went to crippling depression and suicidal thoughts almost continually. I know they say it usually only happens at first.  I was almost at a year with it getting worse.

This happened last night and I’m still feeling worse for wear today. My legs feel like jelly. During the night I experienced the chills and then had hot flushes.  My pupils were completely dilated.

I started on a very low dose for 2 weeks then 75mg which I have now been on for over 12 months.My panic attacks have gone and I can now face the day without the constant feeling of overwhelming worry and despair.

Every time before I was due my period I contemplated suicide and in between it would pop up every other day. I just couldn’t cope anymore so went to my doctor and told her everything. That’s when I started my journey on venlaxfine. I started at 37.5mg and increased it higher the following two weeks,it would work then it didn’t and my anxiety came back so bad so I then upped it each time I had a bad episode of anxiety and suicidal thoughts.  I’m on the highest dose now and can honestly say I’ve never felt better.  I can’t even remember the last time I thought about suicide and my relationship is going well with my sons dad again.

I suffered every side effect. All of them! I'm so glad its winter so I could go outside and cool off. Possibly the worst night of my life. It almost gave me a panic attack. I hallucinated. I have diarrhea and was throwing up. I'm still jittery today but no more hot flashes... for now. I called my Dr at 5am freaking out. I'm so embarrassed. He gave me 150mg venlafaxine to take once a day with food. I took it at 9pm in case I did have side effects I could sleep through them. Bad decision. I'll probably never take depression medicine again.,Stef
23,Venlafaxine,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,,"January 6, 2021",116,"Venlafaxine changed my life, after only taking it for 2 months. The side effects were horrible at first I had headaches and would shake or tremble when anxious and I got extremely itchy. When you suffer from depression, GAD, PTSD and OCD its a small price to pay because I started to see a change in my mood and my anxiety. For the first time in my life my anxiety was almost gone I could go out in public and engage in conversation for the first time in my life. I started on 75mg and I am still on it 6 months after. Lexapro made me a slow zombie and did nothing for my anxiety it only helps for depression. A lot of reviews have negative feedback but if you are in a bad place push through the side effects because its worth it they do go away. This is the only anti depressant that doesn't make me a zombie during the day I feel more awake. Stay strong.",Luckyluke

I was the lowest I’ve ever been, no interest in anything and even contemplated walking away from my life (I was very ill mentally) until I started to take venlafaxine. Started January and it’s now October, I’m a new woman, can deal with things, I don’t overreact or make my mood effect the household. It’s greatly improved my anxiety too, still have same fears but can rationalise things better and more healthy.Bit worried about coming off in future but trying to just live in the now.

I had been in the med for almost a year & forgot to take it one day. By lunch I was vomiting and felt horrible. It took about a day or two for me to start to feel better. I NEVER skipped again and was terrified of trying to come off of this medicine. Only stayed on it longer because I was afraid of the withdrawal. I finally worked with my doctor to try to come off of it. He was great and did what he could to make it tolerable. I still had to pull apart the capsules and take out a few of the balls each day. I felt awful: brain zaps, nausea, confusion, dizziness, memory issues, and headaches. If I had known how incredibly life altering this drug is,I never would’ve started it.

After a long battle with severe anxiety and stress that lead to long bouts of depression I was finally prescribed venlafaxine modified release. Eventually settled on 150mg which slowly but surely started to work alongside my body and I felt better. Missing 2 days or more was a nightmare and resulted in nausea, insomnia, jitters, and the horrible brain lag (only way I can describe it?). I'm now in a much better place in my life and my dr and I are decreasing my dose slowly. Long term side effects I've had are a complete loss of any sleeping pattern combined with horrible night restlessness (feeling like all your skin is ever so slightly itchy), and now that my dose is being decreased I'm noticing I'm having uncontrollable anger outbursts along with increased night tremors. If this drug works for you, the pros are greatly outweighed by the side effects. But those side effects can be debilitating sometimes. Take with extreme caution",Rapture

However, it is important to consider the side effects. The side effects in the beginning were not great for me. I realized quickly that my stomach does not handle this med well, and I WILL throw up if I don’t go to bed right after taking it. However, as long as I take it right before bed it is not a problem. This med also made me feel quite drowsy for awhile at first and also gave me night twitches (body twitches when I was trying to sleep), which were annoying. After about 6 months of being on 75mg my body has completely adjusted to it and I no longer get those side effects (except I do still have to take it right before I go to bed). The withdrawals are also very uncomfortable, and if I miss a day, I am extremely dizzy.

45,Venlafaxine,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,,"November 13, 2019",67,"This venlafaxine worked well for a long time, but about five years I became less active.  I thought it was the natural process of ageing, but after being on it for about 15 years, I subconsciously realised my brain had stopped producing as much dopamine, oxytocin, and probably endorphin as it used to.  I became reclusive, till someone shattered that, then my brain said it'd had enough.  It needed dopamine to get me out and about, it needed oxytocin for me to cope with people and being out and about, and it needed endorphin to overcome the aches of daily life.  All I had was what the drug supplied; the other processes had dried up.So I stopped the medication.  Had no choice.  Within 2 months, dopamine and oxytocin started coming back.  I now feel as young as I did when I started taking it over fifteen years ago.It worked great, but it's important not to keep taking it, as the brain will readjust neurotransmitters to compensate in the long run, and then you are a hollow person, supported only by the drug.",Rodenberry

For the first time in 13 years of treatment for anxiety (GAD & social) I have experienced a extended period of relief.  I took a SSRI for most of the past decade and it seemed somewhat helpful but never really gave me sustained relief.  I am now at 6 weeks on Venlafaxine (75 mg for 12 days, 150 mg for 30 days, now at 225mg), and I am feeling much calmer.  Most exciting, I still get panicked thoughts, but don’t seem to have the associated fear feelings.  I am so hopeful that this will last!  Side effects are very noticeable, but bearable.  Headache, some nausea, minor dizziness, a dry mouth and frustratingly slow urination.  I hope those will go away with time, but I’ve been on the 225mg for a week and they have been consistent.

I continued to take it over the course of several years and in hindsight, I don't think it was quite right for me. I became a bit out-of-character, high-strung and weird. Maybe slightly bipolar but possibly a reaction to very difficult times and lots of change. Some of my worst periods of mental illness were on this stuff; my doctor had me on 300mg+ at one point, things were very flat, dysphoric and my adrenals were certainly working. I was a bit suicidal and a little detached at points. I eventually ditched it, experienced some lack-of-energy brain-zappy withdrawal for a while. I spent a few months drug free then found meds I suite a lot better.

Previously, I was taking Lexapro and went off it for a short period of time.  I returned to my doctor and he prescribed Effexor, 75 mg/day.  I experienced improvement with my anxiety, depression and panic attacks.  Like everyone else, I feel it (dizzy, hungover like symptoms) when I miss a daily dose.  I experience constipation and don't sleep as deep or through the night like I used to.  These side effects are on the list for this medicine - so, no surprises here.  I give this a rating of 9 because it is very helpful to relieve the symptoms of my depression, anxiety and panic attacks.

I am taking it for PTSD after a long battle with cancer.  I became hypervigilent looking up cancer metastasis everyday for hours.  I did this for two years and realized finally that I had to do something to stop this behavior. I was certain that my cancer was going to kill me and I wouldn't be diagnosed quickly enough.  This brought on deep depression and a constant fear.  I isolated myself because I thought it would be better for me and family and friends if I just stayed away that way if I died no one would miss me. Stupid huh.  I am so glad I finally asked for help.

I was sleepy throughout the day and had no energy. But if I took my second dose too late in the day, I couldn't sleep at night.

You could be susceptible to serotonin overload, I mixed it with a high dose trazodone for sleep issues and found that it made my anxiety worse and more apparent to people, so I switched to Limbitrol which seems to work well with it and don't forget, if you stop these drugs don't do it cold turkey.
