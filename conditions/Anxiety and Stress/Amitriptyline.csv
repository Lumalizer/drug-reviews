I am now 31 despite trying to make lifestyle changes my anxiety got so bad I was physically and mentally exhausted, and depressed. Before amitriptyline I would medicate with alcohol, my anxiety was so bad that I would drink before friends or family came round. I finally took the step to ask for help. I was hesitant to start amitriptyline but honestly this is the best decision I have ever made. I feel like the lights have been switched on. I talk to people without overthinking the conversation afterwards. I went from feeling stressed  and anxious everyday to being care free. I am more focused at work and able to finish tasks. The quality of my sleep is better and that time before I fall asleep is not spent worrying . I only wish I started this years ago anxiety has caused me to miss out on so much in my professional and personal life. I am finally living the life I deserve I have never felt so care free.

17,Amitriptyline,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 5, 2021",9,"This drug helps me so much, I have tinnitus and crazy stress with anxiety. It calms me down and really doesn't have the awful side effects I get from SSRI's, I was actually allergic to zoloft and it made everything worse, even after 2 weeks. But 10 days on this drug and I'm beginning to see subtle improvement, and I haven't had a panic attack since I started. I take propanolol and klonopin still but I think the need for those will diminish soon. I used to take this same drug a few years back and it helped me so much, hoping for the same results. Started on 50mg and hopefully that's where I can stay, but I'm not scared if I need to up my dose, unlike zoloft which scared me everytime I'd up the dose, along with the scary side effects. No real side effects from this, at least none that are noticeable or annoying.",Stressed

Quite simply because it works, I take 25mg a day at night before bed and it has very good results for reducing and almost eliminating health anxiety, negative thought patterns and symptoms of depression. Having been off it for a good few years and finding myself coping pretty well, 2020 and the pandemic/lockdown struck hard and I hadn't realised how bad my mood and anxiety had become until last month when I practically broke down with the stress of it all.

Amitriptyline has really helped me. I started on 10mg for a week, first week I was a bit drowsy in the morning but I still tend to go to sleep and take it quite late. I bumped up to 25mg and I am so much better. No painful emotions and moods swings, no anxiety, I can concentrate more at work and I feel I am achieving more than usual. I sleep well even if I still tend to go to sleep late, no more night sweats! My physical symptoms are better too.

Usually I am very sensitive to medications. I take this at night and it has helped me sleep sooo much better, I do not wake up in the middle of the night anymore. My dizziness is gradually starting to mellow out and I haven't been able to say that in over a year. I finally feel like there is hope for me to start feeling myself again. My Dr. is going to gradually up the dose after 3 months and I think this will completely rid me of my dizziness.

29,Amitriptyline,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 5, 2020",225,"amitriptyline changed my life. Been on many AD all SSRIS made me feel awful, couldn't think properly, numb. With amitriptyline I've had none of that, can think clearly. SSRIs helped me not have such obsessive thoughts, haven't found that with amitriptyline so I have to work in therapy to help my thoughts but means my brain isn't mush like on SSRIs.I have issues around attachment, some BPD traits, when starting amitriptyline I was the worst ever. Everyday was consumed with uncontrollable fear of abandonment, I was in a state of constant panic. 4/5 months in my life is totally different. Rarely feel panic or anxiety, emotions are more regulated, I'm happy. Amitriptyline wasn't recommended to me. I had to do the research + then ask my doctor. - : heart rate, sometimes weird eye twitch. Hope this helps someone out there, it will get better. Really sucks but we deserve a fulfilling life + suffering means we understand + can advocate for others with mental illness",Hsgwgus

It has really helped. It also helped me to relax more. Which made a big difference. My problem was. When I needed a refill. My doc took his time refilling it. Not having my med for 2 weeks was the worst. I totally went crazy. Mean not focused. Life seemsed pointless. I didn’t know what or why this was happening. Found out. Never stop taking this drug cold turkey. Back on it. Feeling normal again. Will always make sure this never happens again.,Anonymous
31,Amitriptyline,Anxiety and Stress,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 16, 2020",72,"In the beginning amitriptyline was a terrible drug me. I took it once during a pretty bad period of anxiety, about 30mg, and it just took me from anxious to being confused and emotionally passive. So I thought it was not for me. Then I started taking 5mg for pain after some pain in my shoulder combined with migraine attacks. And not only did it help me sleep at night, it started doing wonders for my anxiety. So I think if you manage to power thru the drowsy period when you get used to it, it's actually a really great drug with few side effects. I used to swear to gabapentin, but amitriptyline has proven so much better actually. It has reduced my need for so many other drugs, and I've gotten my brain function back due to less heavier drugs. It also has made me need medication less often, which eventually is what you want.",30yr male

I have been on it for 7 months now and I don’t think I would have gotten through this year without it. The old me would have been having panic attacks and catastrophic thinking over the bush fires and Covid but thanks to Endep I have been able to stay calm and reasonable. I haven’t experienced any negative side effects at all. I guess if anything I can’t get up in the night to my kids bc I’m so deeply asleep but that ok because it just means dad has to get up.

For the first couple months, things were great.  I was productive, so much less overwhelmed and stressed, I was less anxious about my crazy ex, and I could keep up with everything I was doing.  The help in getting to sleep was an added bonus.  However, after the first couple months, the paranoia started creeping in.  At first, I thought someone was outside my house at night. Then, I was convinced cars behind me on the road were following me.  I was checking under my bed, I'm my closet, in my bathroom, and every nook and cranny for someone hiding in there, thinking someone was going to get me. After a month of this increasing paranoia, I tapered down my dose and got off of it.  The paranoia outweighed the benefits.",Silvalady

43,Amitriptyline,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 20, 2019",133,I have been taking low dose (10-20mg) of amitriptyline at night right before bed for the past 8 months & it has worked amazingly well for me and my stress / anxiety. Was originally prescribed this for nerve pain in the throat due to LPR/acid reflux symptoms such as constantly clearing my throat & hoarseness. It has worked great for this as my throat pain is down 90% after only 8 months. These symptoms in turn caused me anxiety & depression and the medicine also helped tremendously with that as well. I get a great sleep every night and the only real side effects worth noting would be dry mouth so make sure you use a good mouthwash such as therabreath drymouth. Tiredness at times and weird dreams sometimes but that just may be me. I highly recommend trying 10mg before bed if you have any of these symptoms and move up to 20mg after a week if you find it really helps you.,Figgs95

During my first year of university however, I experienced severe anxiety to a point where I spent all of my time in my bedroom, even going to the coffee shop next to my house was too hard. I decided to go to my doctor and then she prescribed me fluoxetine (prozac) 20 mg.  I experienced minor relief in my anxiety and extreme depression and suicidal thoughts.  I was on that medication for 3 months when I finally decided to stop.  My doctor switched me to amitriptyline and during the first week or two I felt no benefits and was constantly groggy.  Then, during the first week, I started feeling not only huge relief in my anxiety but I no longer felt depressed!! I am able to live my life, go out with friends, spend time with family, do well at work and SO MUCH MORE. Best medication hands down.  Give it a couple weeks, you won't regret it.",katie123

I've tried other medications for anxiety and depression but none of them worked and most just made my depression worse and did nothing for my anxiety so I stopped trying meds for that for a while.

The first few days taking it made me feel awful and I was out of it the whole time but after that it only got better.

They help with sleep enormously and helped my anxiety, it did not take it away but they worked better than anything I'd previously had, I think the combination of actually being able to get to sleep without lying thinking them random thoughts and not waking up every hour certainly helped. I went to the GP after a week and he prescribed me a bigger dose of 25mg at a lunch and 75mg at night. Also I was on propranolol which helped when my heart was racing, I had 20 mg of those twice per day and they both made a difference.",Wazza

Nothing helped and the SSRIs caused severe side effects.Last week I decided to go back on the amitriptyline. The morning after I took my 1st 10mg dose I already felt calmer. My mood is better, my anxiety is better and I am sleeping well. I just bumped up to 20mg last night.

I take 100mg/day at 8pm normally and I sleep well at night, and feel good generally about how things will be throughout the next day.  I love the smell of roses. ",Anonymous

In between have been on SSRI's and venlafaxine (the latter being a nightmare to withdraw from). Now after a year of medication free I'm back on amitriptyline at my request due to mega anxiety and stress issues (not my doctor's first choice), also currently taking Ramipril and diltiazem for high blood pressure - so far early days and am suffering the main side effect of tiredness but managed a 2.5 mile jog last night. It's early days and I am hoping this will work as well as it did in the past.",mr.happy

Then like everything else once my body got used to it, it stopped working. Now I'm up till 3am in the morning and having to get up at six for work sometimes. So I have tried to be strong and make myself work extra hard during the day to sleep better at night. Has it worked? NO but I am still pushing on.",crazy chick
