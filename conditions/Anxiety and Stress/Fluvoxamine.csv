0,Fluvoxamine,Anxiety and Stress,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 16, 2022",1,Worst experience of my life. I had ringing in my ears constantly and an overall sense of paranoia. Made my already severe medicine phobia worse because of how awful it was to be on it.,Allie

It helped with it and with my bad thoughts but it gave me severe sexual problems so I'm forced to switch. It only started to be helpful after a month and also it can give you sleep problems and anxiety (just at the start, like the first 2 weeks). But the sexual problems are still there even if my depression has been better, but still not cured. So I’m switching now.",Lisca
2,Fluvoxamine,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 25, 2021",1,"I have very bad OCD. Specifically, health anxiety and intrusive thoughts. I went from 50 mg to 100mg in about 4 months. My panic about my health, and my insane intrusive thoughts literally disappeared. Luvox made me feel normal. But I  became homeless after crappy life events for 3 months, so I had to wean myself off. I knew I couldn’t afford it in that time period. Now that I’m no longer homeless, I actually just now took a 100mg tablet from my leftovers pill bottle from July of this year (2021). Side effects: I’m tired as anything!!! Lol. Definitely makes me very drowsy and relaxed. I was having panic (ocd caused) right before I took the pill. Definitely try this out if you have bad OCD!",sevenloaves
3,Fluvoxamine,Anxiety and Stress,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 9, 2021",0,This didn’t work for me. I’ve been on it for almost 2 months after being on mirtazapine for months. I feel exactly how I felt before taking any medicine. My anxiety is nonstop even when I’m sleeping. I’m back to have derealization again and I’m constantly tired and unmotivated and a lil paranoid because of my severe anxiety. But medicine works different for everyone so give it a chance :) the only crappy side effect in the beginning is being nauseous and no appetite but it eventually goes away!!,Rena
4,Fluvoxamine,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 28, 2021",0,Used in low dose to treat anxiety. Works well. No known significant side effects for me.

Talking 3-4 days and intense bloating, hard to concentrate or be at work, etc.  When I would skip a dose to fix my stomach I’d have a bad headache for half the day.

6,Fluvoxamine,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 17, 2021",34,"Luvox (fluvoxamine):I have been on Luvox for 21 years at varying  levels. Yes it has its issues getting on and off it, but I can't imagine life without it. To the people who have issues getting on it because of gastrointestinal issues, you have to go on it slowly. Yes it makes you tired for 4 to 6 weeks, but when I went on this the 1st time I was in a bad way and almost immediately I saw little improvements. Slowly over the 6 weeks the doctor raised my levels and life returned to normal. After one year I weaned myself off the medication only to go back on at a lower dose. I never come off it but I now know from the way I feel when to up and down the level and have played with how much I take for 21 years. Never come off cold turkey and always raise the amount slowly. Hope this helps .",MP

I just had the worst anxiety attack I've ever had.  I'm starting to think I need to try something different as I still feel anxious and depressed.

18,Fluvoxamine,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 6, 2020",97,"Luvox (fluvoxamine):Luvox has worked well for me.  One issue is how it interacts with caffeine, it can be very unpleasant.  I feel sped up and then hungover, sometimes for days.

19,Fluvoxamine,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,,"December 11, 2019",33,"I started taking this about 7 weeks ago and it’s really really been helping me. I used to have to step on my shoes before putting them on, check everything a million times before closing at work, and feel anxious literally every time I left the house or did anything even mildly stressful.  But now it’s like I can actually feel anxious without it overtaking my entire life. I still feel anxious but it’s something I can handle now, it’s no longer this overwhelming thing to be terrified of. The scary thoughts pop into my head and then they just go. I no longer obsess over distressing feelings, I’m able to let negative feelings come and go. I also haven’t experienced dissociation since I started taking this which is nice. The only downside is I’m really really tired. I can sleep for a long time and still feel exhausted. Living with manageable anxiety is worth it for me. But overall this medicine has really helped me and I’m so glad I started taking it.",Cam

Very unusual dreams , insomnia , mood swings , anger and bursts of rage, etc. Stick to psychological therapy folks. This drug can turn you mean.

I will say one thing is I have noticed my anxiety is a bit at bay but I also have health OCD. With a condition I am currently going through it hasn't exactly stopped the thoughts running through my head. I think and think that something terrible is going to happen to me. I am going to power through and see what this medication can do. I hope it works because I know I can't do this alone or even with a therapist and psychiatrist.,Jennifer

I thought this was odd, but figured it was just a fluke. A few weeks later I was given the extended release. First night in my system I woke up having the ""mother of all panic attacks."" It would not stop. I felt like death had its grip on me. I called 911. Long story short I took my clonazepam and was able to avoid having the ambulance come. The nice 911 operator talked to me for awhile which helped. My doctor said this was an atypical reaction, but I wanted to share my story in case anyone else experienced this.

I use to be an emotional girl with obsessive thoughts that ran my mind all day long. Now.. I go to work, I work (usually would think about my worries at work while being stressed at work as it already is). I handle complex situations with more confidence and less anxiety. I'm on 100 mg, can't wait to try 150, think that will be perfect. No major side effects at all. Really believe this helps give me that push at living my life in the now and helps stop the ruminating. I've tried other stuff and nothing compares. With Luvox... I stress less, cry less, and focus more on what's important. Can't wait to continue and see more improvement ....",AwdrEnuh

It was really hard to initially start the medication and increase the dosing. But I stuck with it. After awhile, I noticed the drug ""took the edge off"" of my anxiety. I was getting less panic attacks and was able to starting doing things I was avoiding. My only issues with this drug are that 1) it's very sedating 2) I still have anxiety - some days are better than others but I'm looking for complete relief. I know it's possible because I've been on medication that did just that. Any suggestions? I take 150mg in morning and then again at night.",SarKC

It is really important that you take it at the same time every day and that you follow a good sleeping schedule and not go to bed very late (i.e. after 11pm) for best results.There is only one downside for me and that is more difficult to reach orgasm and libido is reduced.

It just helps keep your thoughts clear so that you can deal with life's challenges. The biggest side effect was that I wanted to sleep all the time.

Both helped with my depression symptoms however neither helped my anxiety at all and both killed my appetite and sex drive. I also tried Xanax occasionally and Buspar. However although these relieved my anxiety they made my depression worse. It was a catch 22. Finally doc put me on a low dose (25mg) of Luvox. What a relief!
