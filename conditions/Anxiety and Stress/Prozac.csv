0,Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 10, 2022",1,"Prozac saved my life. I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life, but after a stressful incident, I began to have extreme anxiety and panic. I couldn’t sleep more than 1 or 2 hours, I couldn’t eat, and had multiple panic attacks a day. I went to see my doctor and she prescribed Zoloft. Side effects of Zoloft were too much, so we switched to Prozac. Within a few days on Prozac my appetite improved, but I still struggled with anxiety/panic - then after about 2.5 weeks the anxiety started to lessen, and after about a month or so I was massively improved. I still struggle, but Prozac made life bearable again, and therapy helps for the rest. As far as side effects, I did struggle a bit to stay asleep - I take trazodone now to help that. I had some diarrhea and acid reflux the first 2 weeks, but that’s gone. My hands shook the first month, also gone now. No changes to sex drive. So thankful for this med!",siaaa97
1,Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 28, 2022",3,"Well 2 years after Covid I have been dealing with minor OCD, social anxieties, intrusive thoughts. It all started to effect me physically around Feb 2020. I had shortness of breath, very anxious that made me feel horrible. I've always been a very relaxed person, never have been effected by stress/anxiety. I decided to take my doctors advice and try Zoloft for a month, I felt crazy! The crazy feeling never went away so I stopped taking it. Several months later I decided to try Prozac. I was very hesitant at first and it took me weeks to take the first pill of 10mg. I took 10mg for 2 weeks and then moved up to 20mg. During the first few weeks from start I honestly did not have a lot of issues. It all seemed to level out around the 4/6th week. Its been great! I do have seldom moments once in a while but they are not nearly as bad as it used to be. I feel relaxed again, able to go on with my life as normal. What a life saver!",i get it now!

I didn't know I had so much anxiety before I met this doctor who prescribed prozac. I got the diagnose bipolar disorder type 2, I thought I was just sensative and that it was normal to feel the way I did before. My life has changed, I'm so happy I can enjoy life the way I want to!

3,Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,5.0,,"February 8, 2022",5,"Hi, I’m 21 years old and a college student. I have GAD/OCD and I finally decided to try Prozac after years of being afraid and not wanting medication. First off, I want to say to whoever is reading this that medication is not a bad thing. It is there to help you. Living with mental illness is incredibly hard, and it doesn’t have to be this difficult. However, after experience- you should know if a drug is working for you sooner rather than later. There are TONS of drugs out there so don’t be discouraged, but if you are experiencing horrible side effects for weeks, this might not be the right med for you. I was on Prozac for 6 weeks and experienced the worst side effects unfortunately. I stuck it out because of these reviews, but recently had to stop because it didn’t work for me. My advice- if the side effects are still unbearable by the 3 week mark, SWITCH. Start taking your meds today! You’ll never know if you don’t try. Bless anyone who reads this!!",Anonymous
4,Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 3, 2022",2,"Firstly don't take these type of medications until you get diagnosis for a long term mental health condition these are only lifeline drugs not drugs to play with because your a bit down or a bit anxious because these drugs only work when they are in your system they reuptake serotonin and use it more efficiently so how can people come off them and say it really helped? That is impossible!!! If you had GAD , SAD , PTSD , BI POLAR or similar then these can help but only long term, stop taking them and you will be the same as before or worse because you have become dependent on this medication recycling your own serotonin for you so you can definitely be worse off. Basically if your on a high dose there is a very good possibility of erectile dysfuntion but my situation was so desperate life was more important than sex, feeling good and being able to look at a beautiful world through new eyes outweighed my new monk lifestyle of no sex.",Read this
5,Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 20, 2022",4,"Prozac was a last-ditch effort for me with antidepressants--everything else had either caused terrible side effects or just didn't make me feel any better. I started on 10mg, went up to 20mg, them 40mg, but 40mg caused severe headaches, so I went back to 20mg after about a month of tolerating them. A week or so ago, I had the realization that I was 'calm'--after a stressful day at work, I didn't feel like I had to go home and hide in my bed on the verge of a full breakdown. That is the first time this has ever happened to me with antidepressants before, and it's a strange but amazing feeling. It takes time to work, but stick with it!",Mar
6,Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,,"January 2, 2022",3,I was prescribed Prozac 20 mg daily for crippling anxiety.  I had been really struggling to live in the present instead of the past or future for many years. I can confirm what many others here have stated with regards to the amount of time it takes for this medication to build up in your system and work.  Week 1 my anxiety and insomnia worsened.  By the end of week 2 these side effects are completely gone and I have a feeling of calm and happiness I have not felt in a very long time.  I will continue to use this medication indefinitely.  If you do decide to take this medication stick it out for a least a couple weeks before you make a decision on if it's right for you!,Anxiety

8,Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,,"December 16, 2021",4,"I’ve always struggled with social anxiety, some generalized anxiety, and mild to moderate depression. Earlier this year due to personal circumstances, my mental health took a nosedive. I have always been resistant to taking antidepressants, but I decided to try 10mg of fluoxetine (I’m sensitive to medication so I didn’t want to try more than that). I can honestly say most of my anxiety and depression has disappeared, my interest in my hobbies has come back, and my work life and relationship has significantly improved as well. The only negative side effect really is that my sex drive is pretty low, and it does occasionally cause loss of appetite for me. Overall I’m very thankful for this medication and give it 9/10.",Anonymous
9,Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 14, 2021",2,"I used prozac when I was between 18-20 and went between 20mg and 40mg. I struggle with anxiety and depression and during this period along with therapy I found that this medication helped. A side effect is that I very rarely cried on it, but I didn’t mind at the time because I was able to enjoy university and create meaningful relationships and experiences. I used it alongside propranolol for anxiety. I switched meds when I was 21 to sertraline/Zoloft because I felt the effectiveness of the fluoxetine wearing off.I'm 23 and a few months ago when I was struggling with severe depression and anxiety I re started fluoxetine. Honestly it really wasn’t great for me this time, I’m in a different and quite hard phase in my life after graduation. First few weeks I didn’t notice the difference and was still struggling, and then at about week 5 I’ve had a really bad anxiety episode that’s lasted about two weeks at this point so have have had to taper off and find something else",mentholillness

I had heard horrible things about the side effects, but she encouraged me to try it.  We started at 10mg. First couple weeks I have to admit I felt nauseous, tired and disoriented. Talk to my doctor and she said give it time and we upped the dose to 20mg.  About 3 weeks in , what a difference!!!  I have never felt better in my life. I finally feel like the real me.  People at work are asking what I’ve done because I radiant happiness and joy.  I have a stressful job, and am going through a horrible divorce.

I was put on Prozac and gave it several months to work. On just about 15 mg (I am extremely sensitive to medicine) I felt entirely drugged, tired all the time, etc. I ended up getting suicidal thoughts, intrusive, obsessive thoughts that I have never had before. I wondered if I was getting worse or if it was from the medicine. My doctor and my family believed it was from the medicine. I am now coming off of it slowly and having nightmares from it. I am hoping I feel back to normal, but I feel this medicine made me feel crazy.",Warning

My poor kids, they’re young so they get sick and I would go into anxious mode as SOON AS they said something hurt. Head hurt? I was done for… couldn’t eat, couldn’t do anything. Checking in on them every 5 minutes. Then the health anxiety hit me personally, where I googled every different type of cancer for whatever odd I found or felt on my body. It took me a good 20 minutes to talk myself out of whatever it was I thought I had. My blood pressure was sky high, I wasn’t sleeping. I gave in… the first two weeks of use weren’t bad except for insomnia. Around week 3 anxiety doubled but I stuck with it because I had read reviews and they had stated that. Week 8 and I was back to a normal human. No more constant fear, chest pain, tummy issues. It’s amazing. No bad side effects other than jaw clenching.",Panicky Momma
15,Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,1.0,,"September 30, 2021",4,"I tried Prozac 10mg for 6 days.  I began waking up between 4 am-5 am every morning with butterflies in my stomach and heart palpitations. Impossible to go back to sleep. Anxiety sensations stayed until mid afternoon each day.  I was unable to eat much and lost 6 pounds in 6 days.  I had waves of horrible doom/fear feelings.  The 6th day I decided to stop because I was going to be unable to keep working in this state.  I also developed broken veins under my eyes.  It has now been 42 days since I stopped taking it and I am just starting to feel like myself again.  My doctor does not think the prozac caused the prolonged issues, but I was NOT having these issues until I took it. I know it left my system long ago, but I can only assume it threw my body into this anxious state and it has been a daily battle to get back to baseline me.  I know-it works for some people, but it was a truly horrific experience for me.  I wanted to be a positive review but I just can’t be.",Jo Jo
16,Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,5.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 4, 2021",4,"I have been on this drug for about three years. It initially helped me feel less anxious. I feel like it slowed down my racing, obsessive thoughts. It also helped me with some depression that I was dealing with at the time. But after a few years of being on it, I realized it was making me emotionally numb, and cognitively slowed down. My memory got a lot worse, and it felt like the years were just whizzing on by. I had trouble remembering names and faces as well. Any time I would try to decrease my dose or stop taking it, I would get intense, debilitating anxiety.This is the first day I am off it fully. I am going to try taking St. John's Wort after about a week once the anxiety comes back into full swing. If the St. John's Wort doesn't work, I'll have to try something else. But I am never (and I repeat, never) going back to Prozac. I don't want to discourage anyone from trying Prozac. Ultimately, this drug can save lives.

19,Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 21, 2021",3,I have no idea if prozac works or not as I did not try it for long enough. All I know is that it did not do much for my anxiety at 10mg. Doctor upped at 20mg and I started having heart problems not long after. Had to go back at 10mg and eventually stop slowly. However I wasn't doing bad as far as depression on 10mg. Prozac or time? Can't say for sure. If you are really in a strong depressed mood it might be worth a try.  I had limited side effects while on the 10mg and did not have any problems quitting using the liquid firm but I wasn't on it for years neither.,Frank221
20,Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 10, 2021",280,"I was encouraged by my psychiatrist to try Prozac for the first time, 20 mg a day. I spent many many years always worried about other people's feelings to the point of overthinking things constantly.  Worrying what people thought of me and I had low self-esteem and low self opinion. Social anxiety was always a serious problem for me also. With that being said, anxiety and worry crept in to full-blown depression. So my doctor put me on Prozac 20 mg. At first it made me a little drowsy but it gave me a way better feeling of calmness, peace and basically not worried at all about little things or what people thought of me. And after about a month, all of those chronic worry stress and fears were totally gone. Totally. In my own personal experience Prozac allowed me to tackle the important things of life and not worry or even think of petty things and other people's behavior. It basically gets rid of toxic stress and worry.  And makes you mentally ""strong"" if that makes sense.",Patrick

23,Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,,"July 30, 2021",8,"Well let's start by saying I used to be completely against using Antidepressants for anything because I have such high suicide rate in my family and I attributed, at my young age, them with the outcomes through my naive outlook. As I became older, I became more depressed, and it came to the point where I was a danger to myself if not in one way or another. And with a new testing available, I was able to channel exactly which depressing work best for me through my psychiatrist. And with that, came prozac. As it completely changed my entire life in a positive way. The only thing I would ever recommend anyone, regardless of the SSRI that works for them, is try not to up your milligrams too high, because the higher, it seems the harder to come off of. Now a year and a half later I'm actually down to 10 mg instead of what I started on, 20mg. Because I refuse to let myself get to that point but, everybody is different.

It's made me a heck of an overachiever, and I was used to surviving it, but when my doctor recommended it, I decided to try it. I barely noticed any difference on 10 mg, so I thought I could try 20 mg. Holy smoke. I can sleep. Now I sleep too much! My mind is not a Catherine wheel, and I don't toss and turn. I don't get those constant stabs of adrenaline all day, like I'm constantly on the verge of total failure.

Got off of it thinking it had to be wellbutrin so stopped taking it for weeks and then retried Prozac for a few days then bam started having night time panic attacks.

No reason that I’m aware of had caused this condition. My husband and I have carried on at home with a schedule doing OK during COVID. All of a sudden the anxiety hit with a vengeance....My pDr told me to up my Lexapro and Clonazapam. No help as I continued fearfully.I found a psychiatrist who would see me but, took me off the benzo.(cold turkey...no relief from severe withdrawal). He started me on 20mg Prozac (dropped Lexapro). Result was a tailspin. Now talking to a therapist and working with my PDr. I’m 7 days on Prozac and working on a consistent morning schedule. My husband is very supportive and caring. I depend on Clonazapam while adjusting to the new Prozac. I am very hopeful that the next several weeks will improve my mental and physical state.

Somethings I've experienced are nightmares, struggling to sleep, night sweats, and mild depression. My body started being an alarm clock and waking me up at 5AM even if I was tired and wanted to sleep my body wouldn't let me. If you cannot handle nightmares I wouldn't take this medication because it occured 90% of my week and they were realistic but that symptom didn't occur until I was on 40mg but it may be different for you. Also some mild depression and little motivation to do anything or get anything done. I didn't have withdrawal symptoms except getting some anxiety when I forgot to take it a few times. I recommend not moving past 20mg, if you feel as if 20mg isn't doing enough then get on another medication, in my opinion 40mg was too strong for me. But overall good experience!",Postivevibesonly

Panic attacks are easier to manage.After 3 months I moved to 40mg capsules.

Have also struggled with panic attacks for the last couple of years. Recently felt my fear and anxiety become so intense that I've slipped into depression. I've taken Celexa in the past and had no side effects but not much anxiety relief. Also tried Cymbalta but felt so exhausted that I would sleep all afternoon even with a full night's sleep. Now trying out Prozac based on generally positive reviews. Even if it doesn't work out for me, reading people's success stories on here give me  hope. So far I've had reduced appetite and increased anxiety, as many others have reported in the first few weeks. I take Lorazepam when I feel panic coming on. I am going to continue on Prozac and hope for the best. Thanks to everyone else for sharing their experiences-- they have really helped me during this difficult time.",seashell

I asked my dr about prozac after I couldn't leave my house . I was riddled with fear and anxiety. We started off with 10 mg. I'm not gonna lie the first 2 weeks was hell. But I pushed through because I knew like all meds there is always an adjustment period. After it finally got in my system I went from needing xanax daily to occasionally needing it . I recently upped my dosage to 20mg . I can tell it working. Not only with my  PMDD but my anxiety. Stress. And panic disorder and  PTSD. Do yourself a favor. Don't google side effects.

I read the reviews here before I tried it and I was beside myself worried about the side effects. I didn’t have any side effects for the first 5 weeks apart from lack of appetite. Around the 5/6 week mark was when I started to feel happier, less anxious and lighter! This was also when I felt more side effects such as dizziness at night, diarrhoea and waking up throughout the night. These side effects, whilst annoying, are minor compared to the anxiety and panic I have felt for my whole life. I would recommend this medication for anxiety and panic disorder. I feel like I can finally deal with my anxiety instead of it ruling my life.

Prozac helps me a lot in daily life, gives me time and peace to recover from my burn-out, and gives me room in my head and emotions for good therapy sessions.

Medicine can only keep the symptoms back for a certain amount of time before it comes back in some form. I put my reduction of my symptoms 80% to learning to change my response to OCD. The first few times I took prozac the symptoms disappeared but I wasn't doing any therapy/CBT, as a result when I came off it and then another OCD provoking situation came into my life, hey presto! it comes back.

In my case, a WONDERFUL side effect was delayed ejaculation, which enabled me to be a much better lover. However, like all SSRIs, after some years, Prozac ""poops out"" and loses its effectiveness. Once it pooped out, I tried getting off it several times, but as soon as the drug was completely out of my system (it takes a few weeks to clear) I kept hitting a rock-bottom depression that was definitely WORSE than when I first began the drug. The key for me to finally succeed in quitting was VERY SLOW TAPERING of the dosage.

In my case, I began prozac because I had developed anxiety and OCD after a difficult injury I sustained. As I expected, the first few days were very tough, extremely bad anxiety while trying to go to sleep.

My psychiatrist was an arrogant older man who had zero interest in listening to the (serious) concerns of a 13 year old girl. He prescribed me Prozac and failed to address the headaches I experienced on the drug. Needless to say, it didn’t even touch the symptoms of the mental distress I was experiencing. I went from mildly depressed to suicidal in a matter of months.

But when my boyfriend and I broke up I literally went to my PsycDoc the very next day. I had done my research on AD’s and thought that Prozac would be the best for me. My Doc agreed. I kept a log every single day I took Prozac starting from Day #1 until Day #30.  It took 24 days before I started feeling little random bursts of happiness. But up until day #24 it was pure torture. It hurt to smile, I completely lost my appetite, I could not sleep, I was sad, I experienced soooo much anxiety is was painful.

So my Doc increased my dose to 40mg. this time around I almost gave up and went back to 20mg, but thankfully I did not. For 3 weeks of taking 40mg I was soooo tired, fatigue and lethargic. I did not experience this on 20mg. and I was constantly hungry too. So after week #3 I called my Doc so I can make an appointment to go back down to 20mg. he was out of town so I had to wait. When his office called me back to schedule me in, the awful side effects of 40mg were gone and I was back to feeling clear, calm and happy again. So here is my own personal advice from my own journey with Prozac… I’ve been on it for a little over 2 months. You have to get worse before you get better. No matter what you think, YOU WILL GET BETTER. Prozac is literally reprogramming and rewiring your brain and that TAKES TIME. Side note: I’m 31 years old and ex-boyfriend and I are back together and happy.  So were all those days of torture worth it? It sure was.",Calyfornia
214,Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,,"July 15, 2016",75,"I previously took Celexa for GAD; but it stopped working. Switched to Paxil. Paxil is great for anxiety but it gave me constant nausea that wouldn't go away. I switched to Prozac. The first 2 weeks on Prozac, it gave me more anxiety, nausea and unable to eat a lot. After two weeks, my anxiety/panicky was reduced, appetite is good again and sometimes I will get bouts of nausea. So far, Prozac at 40 is working pretty good. I also take Valium 5 mg as needed once or twice a week.  Valium is amazing. When Prozac is not working well on certain days, Valium is used to smooth things out.  Valium is a good rx since it will stay in our system for a longer time. If you use it scarcely, you can use Valium for life. Prozac & Valium: Excellent together.",Anonymous

I'm not experiencing anxiety and panic attacks like I was prior to the Prozac.  The first three weeks of the medication involved sick feelings, but I'm glad that I stuck with it.  I also started to visit with a psychologist once a month. This has been very beneficial.  Makes me wonder why I struggled with this for years before getting help.",Anonymous
