0,Fluoxetine,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 10, 2022",1,"Prozac (fluoxetine):Prozac saved my life. I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life, but after a stressful incident, I began to have extreme anxiety and panic. I couldn’t sleep more than 1 or 2 hours, I couldn’t eat, and had multiple panic attacks a day. I went to see my doctor and she prescribed Zoloft. Side effects of Zoloft were too much, so we switched to Prozac. Within a few days on Prozac my appetite improved, but I still struggled with anxiety/panic - then after about 2.5 weeks the anxiety started to lessen, and after about a month or so I was massively improved. I still struggle, but Prozac made life bearable again, and therapy helps for the rest. As far as side effects, I did struggle a bit to stay asleep - I take trazodone now to help that. I had some diarrhea and acid reflux the first 2 weeks, but that’s gone. My hands shook the first month, also gone now. No changes to sex drive. So thankful for this med!",siaaa97
1,Fluoxetine,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 7, 2022",0,I was on 40 mg of fluoxetine for about 12 years and one day decided I didn't need it any more.  Went off it for about 3 months and then realized I needed it again.  After a year of feeling pretty normal I started having anxiety again pretty bad.  The dr has increased me to 80 mg.  Been two weeks and I had a rough night/morning today.  Still nauseous if I don't keep food in my stomach.  Trying to push through the next couple weeks.  I will update.  I don't see anyone on here taking 80 mg which scares me.  Any thoughts on this increase?,Buckmaster75

5,Fluoxetine,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 28, 2022",3,"Prozac (fluoxetine):Well 2 years after Covid I have been dealing with minor OCD, social anxieties, intrusive thoughts. It all started to effect me physically around Feb 2020. I had shortness of breath, very anxious that made me feel horrible. I've always been a very relaxed person, never have been effected by stress/anxiety. I decided to take my doctors advice and try Zoloft for a month, I felt crazy! The crazy feeling never went away so I stopped taking it. Several months later I decided to try Prozac. I was very hesitant at first and it took me weeks to take the first pill of 10mg. I took 10mg for 2 weeks and then moved up to 20mg. During the first few weeks from start I honestly did not have a lot of issues. It all seemed to level out around the 4/6th week. Its been great! I do have seldom moments once in a while but they are not nearly as bad as it used to be. I feel relaxed again, able to go on with my life as normal. What a life saver!",i get it now!
6,Fluoxetine,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 26, 2022",0,"Yeah have been on antidepressants for 17 years. Formerly citalopram (Celexa) for 9 years which worked great. Then escitalopram (Lexapro) for 3 years. The Lexapro worked okay but I had a lot of fatigue that just never went away. Which is why I switched to fluoxetine (Prozac). It has been 3 years now since I started the Prozac. I am on 20mg and it is hands down the best SSRI on the market. Not only is it the oldest,   but because of that, it has more studies behind it than any other. It’s  the easiest SSRI to quit. Because of its long half life, Prozac doesn’t cause horrible withdrawals like so many other antidepressants. It leaves the body slowly so it practically tapers itself! It’s actually the only ssri you can stop cold turkey. The long half life is also helpful if you accidentally miss a dose- because you won’t start having brain zaps.",Best SSRI IMO

9,Fluoxetine,Anxiety and Stress,5.0,,"February 8, 2022",5,"Prozac (fluoxetine):Hi, I’m 21 years old and a college student. I have GAD/OCD and I finally decided to try Prozac after years of being afraid and not wanting medication. First off, I want to say to whoever is reading this that medication is not a bad thing. It is there to help you. Living with mental illness is incredibly hard, and it doesn’t have to be this difficult. However, after experience- you should know if a drug is working for you sooner rather than later. There are TONS of drugs out there so don’t be discouraged, but if you are experiencing horrible side effects for weeks, this might not be the right med for you. I was on Prozac for 6 weeks and experienced the worst side effects unfortunately. I stuck it out because of these reviews, but recently had to stop because it didn’t work for me. My advice- if the side effects are still unbearable by the 3 week mark, SWITCH. Start taking your meds today! You’ll never know if you don’t try. Bless anyone who reads this!!",Anonymous
10,Fluoxetine,Anxiety and Stress,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 4, 2022",0,"I recently have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety with panic disorder and started taking Fluoxetine about 4 months ago. It took some time to notice a positive difference but it has been up and down. I started taking the medication every morning, but it would cause me to feel sleep deprived and making my day to day difficult to get through. I was very unproductive at work, sleeping during my lunch instead of eating, and even had a difficult time driving because of how tired I would be. After following my PCP directions to start taking it at night, I was not nearly as tired anymore. After taking 20mg a night for about 2 months now, I'm starting to feel as if the medication is no longer effective. I'm having anxiety attacks more frequently, mood is up and down, and it's very difficult for me to express my emotions. I have also gained weight, having crazy dreams, and I'm in my head a lot.

11,Fluoxetine,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 3, 2022",2,"Prozac (fluoxetine):Firstly don't take these type of medications until you get diagnosis for a long term mental health condition these are only lifeline drugs not drugs to play with because your a bit down or a bit anxious because these drugs only work when they are in your system they reuptake serotonin and use it more efficiently so how can people come off them and say it really helped? That is impossible!!! If you had GAD , SAD , PTSD , BI POLAR or similar then these can help but only long term, stop taking them and you will be the same as before or worse because you have become dependent on this medication recycling your own serotonin for you so you can definitely be worse off. Basically if your on a high dose there is a very good possibility of erectile dysfuntion but my situation was so desperate life was more important than sex, feeling good and being able to look at a beautiful world through new eyes outweighed my new monk lifestyle of no sex.",Read this

I had been really struggling to live in the present instead of the past or future for many years. I can confirm what many others here have stated with regards to the amount of time it takes for this medication to build up in your system and work.  Week 1 my anxiety and insomnia worsened.  By the end of week 2 these side effects are completely gone and I have a feeling of calm and happiness I have not felt in a very long time.  I will continue to use this medication indefinitely.

I took it for 10 weeks and it 'kicked in' after 6 weeks. It definitely made me happy and also more calm in stressful situations. Works well for anxiety(20mg) but one must wait for at least 5 weeks for the medicine to work. Unfortunately I could not tolerate the medicine well after the 10th week and had to stop. I experienced pretty bad withdrawal symptoms but do not led this discourage you. These medicine really do work by rewiring your brain but one must prepare for the withdrawal effects. Please consult your doctor and also please take it only when absolute necessary. Also works well for GERD induced by stress.,TrebleClef

I have always been resistant to taking antidepressants, but I decided to try 10mg of fluoxetine (I’m sensitive to medication so I didn’t want to try more than that). I can honestly say most of my anxiety and depression has disappeared, my interest in my hobbies has come back, and my work life and relationship has significantly improved as well. The only negative side effect really is that my sex drive is pretty low, and it does occasionally cause loss of appetite for me.

I struggle with anxiety and depression and during this period along with therapy I found that this medication helped. A side effect is that I very rarely cried on it, but I didn’t mind at the time because I was able to enjoy university and create meaningful relationships and experiences. I used it alongside propranolol for anxiety. I switched meds when I was 21 to sertraline/Zoloft because I felt the effectiveness of the fluoxetine wearing off.I'm 23 and a few months ago when I was struggling with severe depression and anxiety I re started fluoxetine.

My dose increased over time to 80 mg once a day. For me, it completely and fully treated my anxiety, and I was able to do things that my anxiety would have prevented me from doing before. I did notice a decrease in libido, and I experienced weight loss on this drug (it seems to be completely dependent on how your anxiety/depression impacts your appetite, I would overeat when I was stressed, the fluoxetine helped manage the stress so I wouldn't overeat meaning that I lost weight). At the dose that I was on though, I was extremely drowsy at all times, and could sleep for 16+ hours a day if I didn't set alarms, and had to take multiple naps throughout the day. I was brought back down to 40 mg and the drowsiness has almost completely disappeared. Different people can have very different reactions to the same SSRI.",Anonymous

I have had anxiety from stress for the last 6 months and was prescribed Mirtazapine (NASSA) initially 15mg,then 30mg, then 45mg.  Didn't feel like it was working so ended up changing doctors after 3 months and they started me on Fluoxetine.  After a couple days it caused my tinnitus to be quite loud but I carried on for a week.  I then changed from Fluoxetine (SSRI) to Duloxetine 30mg (SNRI) in the hope it would carry on the benefits but remove the tinnitus noise.  It hasn't so after nearly 2 weeks I have been prescribed Trazadone (Tetra) 50mg twice a day which I am starting tonight.

I lowered the dose until I could tolerate it, which was about 2.5 mg so I don’t think it is even doing anything at that low of a dose, but with horrible medical anxiety it’s hard to try something else.

I feel like it slowed down my racing, obsessive thoughts. It also helped me with some depression that I was dealing with at the time. But after a few years of being on it, I realized it was making me emotionally numb, and cognitively slowed down. My memory got a lot worse, and it felt like the years were just whizzing on by. I had trouble remembering names and faces as well. Any time I would try to decrease my dose or stop taking it, I would get intense, debilitating anxiety.This is the first day I am off it fully. I am going to try taking St. John's Wort after about a week once the anxiety comes back into full swing. If the St. John's Wort doesn't work, I'll have to try something else.

I recommend not moving past 20mg, if you feel as if 20mg isn't doing enough then get on another medication, in my opinion 40mg was too strong for me. But overall good experience!",Postivevibesonly

I remember before going to school I would have panic attacks, I would stress so much I'd become sick, and I would shake and sweat badly from the stress. I would cry so much from becoming overly stressed.Now, I feel a significant change. I am much more calm in stressful situations. I also don't cry or get angry easily.I'm young, so my parents let me decide if I wanted to try the medication. I was worried about all the side affects, but after some overthinking, I decided to try it out. It took about 1 and a half months to start feeling a change, and I wish I took it earlier.

Maybe it'll work for you but it didn't for me. It made my mind race and made me speak fast, I had insomnia, the shakes and increased anxiety and panic attacks. Maybe if I would have stuck with it it would have worked out for me but getting through the beginning stages just wasn't possible for me",Kotyko

The improvement is subtle. I don’t have that continuous on-edge anxious feeling, nor the pit of my stomach feeling, and things sort of roll off my back which is great. My quality of life has improved. I know this can take 2 months or more to feel full effects and in that time people increase dosage instead of practicing patience.

The most important thing that people need to realise is that OCD is a behavioural/thought process problem. Medicine can only keep the symptoms back for a certain amount of time before it comes back in some form. I put my reduction of my symptoms 80% to learning to change my response to OCD. The first few times I took prozac the symptoms disappeared but I wasn't doing any therapy/CBT, as a result when I came off it and then another OCD provoking situation came into my life, hey presto! it comes back.

For the first four years, it delivered a great benefit in reducing my anxiety and overthinking. In my case, a WONDERFUL side effect was delayed ejaculation, which enabled me to be a much better lover. However, like all SSRIs, after some years, Prozac ""poops out"" and loses its effectiveness. Once it pooped out, I tried getting off it several times, but as soon as the drug was completely out of my system (it takes a few weeks to clear) I kept hitting a rock-bottom depression that was definitely WORSE than when I first began the drug. The key for me to finally succeed in quitting was VERY SLOW TAPERING of the dosage. In other words, instead of going from 20mg down to 10 and then down to 5 in just a few weeks, I went from 20 to 15 and STAYED THERE for a few weeks, then I went down to 10 and STAYED THERE for a few more weeks, etc.)",Sunriver

They have all been very helpful during these past few months so I thought I should share my own experiences just in case anyone out there might find it helpful.  I started Prozac 20mg about 2 months ago.  I always knew I had anxiety and mild depression and was always curious about taking anti-depressants. But when my boyfriend and I broke up I literally went to my PsycDoc the very next day. I had done my research on AD’s and thought that Prozac would be the best for me. My Doc agreed. I kept a log every single day I took Prozac starting from Day #1 until Day #30.  It took 24 days before I started feeling little random bursts of happiness. But up until day #24 it was pure torture. It hurt to smile, I completely lost my appetite, I could not sleep, I was sad, I experienced soooo much anxiety is was painful. But thanks to reading all these threads I did not give up and was hopeful that things will get better just as everyone said it will. Every day after Day #24 just seemed to have gotten better and better. And on Day #30, it finally hit me and I understood what Prozac is all about. Yes it is true that it is a life saver. If I had to put it in just two words to explain how I feel on Prozac I would have to say Calm and Clear. But I’m not finished just yet… after a few weeks I started feeling like the 20mg wasn’t really working. So my Doc increased my dose to 40mg. this time around I almost gave up and went back to 20mg, but thankfully I did not. For 3 weeks of taking 40mg I was soooo tired, fatigue and lethargic. I did not experience this on 20mg. and I was constantly hungry too. So after week #3 I called my Doc so I can make an appointment to go back down to 20mg. he was out of town so I had to wait. When his office called me back to schedule me in, the awful side effects of 40mg were gone and I was back to feeling clear, calm and happy again. So here is my own personal advice from my own journey with Prozac… I’ve been on it for a little over 2 months. You have to get worse before you get better. No matter what you think, YOU WILL GET BETTER. Prozac is literally reprogramming and rewiring your brain and that TAKES TIME.

617,Fluoxetine,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,,"November 12, 2008",455,"Prozac (fluoxetine):Initially, my doctor started me out on 20mg, but increased the dosage to 30mg after I complained of occassional bouts of anxiety.  I started the medication about six months ago.  I'm 23 and not on any additional medication.  Now, I feel like I can balance college, family and work.  I'm not experiencing anxiety and panic attacks like I was prior to the Prozac.  The first three weeks of the medication involved sick feelings, but I'm glad that I stuck with it.  I also started to visit with a psychologist once a month. This has been very beneficial.  Makes me wonder why I struggled with this for years before getting help.",Anonymous
