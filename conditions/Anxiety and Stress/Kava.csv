0,Kava,Anxiety and Stress,1.0,,"March 21, 2021",2,"I have had anxiety for a while now. I was doing better but had a stressful week so I drank some kava tea I bought at a local grocery store for a few days. My blood pressure shot up and I couldn’t breathe and felt like I was going to pass out. I was admitted to the Emergency Room where it turns out that the kava tea interacted with every medication I was taking. I drank the tea Thursday at lunch and I am still having high blood pressure and pulse on Sunday, not to mention I am terrified to take the medication I need.",HB
1,Kava,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 25, 2019",34,"I have suffered and suffer anxiety, daily gut issues, heart palpitations and fast heart rate and high stress with panic attacks. Always in constant fear. I have used kava medi herb from my naturopath for 4 days now and thank god I am seeing significant changes. I’m on antidepressants still but tapering off and have stopped valium. I am still a little anxious at times but nothing like I was. I pray it stays this way. I do get scared about the reports on liver damage etc but I’m sure it’s ok I’m under supervision and nothing can be as bad as western drugs",Taja
2,Kava,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 26, 2018",29,"I tried a few varieties of Kava, capsules and teas, and found it to be very effective at reducing anxiety. It does not cause any euphoric effects at the amounts I’ve been trying (400-800 mg) but the easing of stress is marked. I am able to function better, with more restful sleep. I don’t like the taste too much. It’s definitely more effective than SSRIs for me though, without any side effects.  It doesn’t act like benzodiazepines either, which mess up my cognition a good deal. I’m happy to leave all those things behind!",Anonymous

Kava has greatly helped with all the stress and anxiety in my life and has given me my life back. I drink Kava using the traditional method used for centuries by Pacific Islanders and I only purchase pure and Kava for reliable sources.  I would recommend Kava to anyone with anxiety, stress or insomnia.",Kava man
