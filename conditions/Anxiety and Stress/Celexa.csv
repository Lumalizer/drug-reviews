0,Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 16, 2022",0,"I started having really bad panic attacks a few weeks ago for absolutely no reason. It kept getting worse and worse, I wasn’t sleeping, and I ended up in the emergency room several times and I was given a prescription for was 10mg Celexa (citalopram) tablets and was instructed to take them at night before bed with a snack. That’s what I did, and roughly 40 minutes after I started panicking worse than ever before. I could barely stand, my vision was blurry and trailing, ears rang super loud. I shook like crazy. I only got an hour of sleep that night. The next night when I took it again, I didn’t have any panic but my head felt weird as anything. This has been my second day on it so far. My whole body feels numb, my head feels distant and I can’t remember anything, it’s hard to breathe, and my muscles ache and burn. My vision is currently messed up and I feel weird as anything. I don’t know how you all stuck through it but I’m stopping it. I can’t do it.",Cody
1,Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 7, 2022",1,"At the beginning of this year, I started experiencing severe depression and anxiety. I went on Celexa about 4, almost 5 weeks ago (20 mg). So far, I don't notice any improvement in my anxiety. I am concerned that the medication is adding to my anxiety, but am going to keep taking it because I heard it can take up to 6-8 weeks to kick in. Really hoping that will be my case. My symptoms lately have been anxiousness, chest tightness, loss of appetite, sweating/nervousness...and again I'm not sure if these symptoms have been influenced by the Celexa or not. I'm assuming the best thing to do is keep pushing through and I may be a case where it can take 2 whole months to kick in.",reviewer123
2,Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,4.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 11, 2022",0,"I took Celexa for a few months about 4 years ago for a couple of months while experiencing extreme depression and anxiety. It seemed to help for a few weeks and then stopped. For a few weeks I had more motivation than usual and less depression and anxiety. It's the only anti-depressant I've taken that didn't cause extremely severe side effects.  I started again six months ago and it is doing absolutely nothing for my depression or anxiety, I just feel tired all the time and my depression and anxiety are getting worse every month. I've been having suicidal feelings for the last two months. The only side effect that has been consistent both times I've taken it is excessive sweating.... and I mean a ridiculous amount of sweating. If I exert myself at all I am dripping in sweat. Sometimes the night sweats are so bad I have to wash my sheets when I wake up because I'm soaked from head to toe.",xfreespirit79x
3,Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 27, 2022",3,"This has helped me with anxiety, depression, and OCD. The only regret I have is not taking it sooner. Absolutely life changing med. If you have side effects stick with it for a few weeks. I noticed my depression lessen within a week and three months in now I have zero anxiety or racing thoughts. OCD is all vanished. This should be your first line med for panic, anxiety, depression. I would never recommend benzodiazepines over this they end up exacerbating anxiety and are physically bad for you.",Eddie
4,Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 16, 2022",3,"I suffered a massive left side hemorrhagic stroke 15 months ago.  While I have recovered almost completely from a physical perspective I was left with crippling anxiety.  I was in a constant state of fight or flight and often felt like I was going to pass out, I felt like it was a side-effect from the stroke that I was just going to have to accept and live with and I also felt bad complaining about it because I should be happy to still be alive.  I eventually mentioned it to my Doctor and she immediately made me feel better and told me we would work to fix it.  She started me on celexa 10mg x 10 days and then increased to 20mg daily.  The first couple of weeks were rough (jumpy, foggy) but after 2 weeks the side-effects subsided.  The 6-8 week mark was when I really noticed how much better I feel, almost no anxiety at all and I feel so much better.  I am so happy I was prescribed this medication.",SisterSami

6,Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 23, 2021",0,"I have been on Celexa for 3 weeks now and I can already feel a huge difference. I was having panic attacks while at work to where I would need to walk away and go into a bathroom to calm down. I would have melt downs at home getting home from work and having to deal with my two boys (3 yrs old & 10yrs old) who were not listening and coming home to a messy house after working all day. Now I come home and I am more at ease, calm and not having any attacks. The first week an a half were a little rough with the side effects tiredness, nauseous, headaches, increased panic attacks, hot flash symptoms (sweating a lot) hungry (I am talking every 10 minutes not feeling full hungry)  and now on week 3 all of my symptoms have gone away. I am taking 10mg Celexa and I see my primary 11/30 for a follow up so hopefully by week 4-6 my anxiety will be gone as well.",Anonymous
7,Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 8, 2021",8,"I am a 28 year old female (born female). My anxiety, night terrors, nightmares, the feeling in my chest of needles, the crying, the repetitive negative thoughts, the aggression, the sudden onset of anger, I was an absolute functional terror. Everything to me was so intense, all of my feelings; the intensity I could not handle. First dose and I felt better, just 10mg. I felt a wave of just ""ahhh"" wash over me within an hour of the first dose. I felt free. Side effects? I went from sleeping 4-5 hours a night to a full 8. Appetite improved and is more balanced. I take mine in the morning every day prior to work and it has helped me be better at my job, which is taking care of disabled people. The job ate me up with stress and now I don't dread going every day - I can clearly understand that this is my role and I am important. I'm not so grouchy or quick to anger anymore. I suffered from anxiety since childhood and parents weren't keen on medicine. I would be lost without this medication.",Nanners

9,Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 2, 2021",8,"Incredible. My anxiety is nearly nonexistent after being overwhelming for almost two decades to the point of self harm to cope. No more rumination and I barely remember what it felt like even though I used to think about the same thing for weeks and months at a time, all day and all night, every waking moment...even interrupting attempts at conversation or TV or books. I feel normal and I'd forgotten what that was like. I am amazed. So thankful. No more constant pit of dread in my stomach, no more nausea. Only temporary side effect was dry mouth. It did make my existing diarrhea worse and that has lasted but it is a small price to pay, I don't mind at all.",Clooouds

12,Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,7.0,,"August 17, 2021",4,"I started taking this medication at 10 mg at the end of May. It’s now mid August and I will admit it took awhile to work. The first couple of days, my side effects were enhanced anxiety, could not sleep, early awakening, fast heart beat and headache, but it all went away after the first week. Before taking citalopram, I would have break downs out of nowhere, intrusive thoughts, and panic attacks. I tried everything before trying medication because I was definitely hesitant, but I’m really glad I tried it. It’s now been over two months and I feel a lot better. I don’t worry about having to leave a situation because of a break down anymore and I get less panic and can brush off intrusive thoughts. Obviously there’s no magic pill, so I still get anxiety and I still have bad days (especially around the time of my period), but citalopram has helped a lot and my family and friends have noticed. It’s really nice not to be crying all the time lol",Anonymous

Thank goodness because oh lordy, did I ever have EVERY side effect for the first 2-2.5 weeks!  Deep tiredness, nausea, diarrhea, brain fog/spacey-ness, those were the most prominent ones.  I really wanted to quit but kept going, and I’m glad I did.  Finally over the last couple days the bad side effects have subsided considerably and I can feel the positives:  happiness, lightness, no more sinking feelings, renewed interest, patience, and a more relaxed mind.  I am smiling at people.  If you’re having all the side effects, hang in there!  Stick it out, take Imodium and/or Zofran, eat crackers and ginger ale, etc with the hope that it may be totally worth it.  Hang on for that breakthrough.  I’m a newly minted Celexa believer!",Jen

I had my first experience with anxiety and panic at 37. I was hospitalized because I didn't know what was going on with me. I kept running to emergency room but my physical being would check out ok. That's when I was admitted to Psych and discovered I had Anxiety and Depression. Hardest thing I ever went through in life. Well recently I just went through it again. Racing thoughts, sleepless night, hopelessness,  feelings of doom. I started back on celexa 20mgs and was worried it wasn't working. I came here read comments and found hope to stick it out and as the weeks passed felt better and better.. at 3 weeks I felt better. 4 weeks little of no racing thoughts or worry. 5 weeks completely in better mood. 6 weeks felt normal again. I still have some worry but not nearly as bad. Hang in there",Shawana312

Before Celexa I was smart and my erection was like iron rod. Apart from that it makes you sometimes too much blind to the issues like I had left two jobs great jobs. It tricks you into comfortable zone you lose touch with some important issues. So it works perfectly well health wise but it can affect your career. This is my personal experience. For many it can boost their career.",Saad
20,Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 31, 2021",4,"I took Celexa one night.   Dr prescribed me 15 mg.  I cut that in half & then cut in half again, so I only took 2.5 mg that night.   When woke the next day, I could barely walk I was that dizzy.  Nauseated beyond belief & my heart was pounding out of my chest with anxiety.  I just had to stay in bed all day.  I honestly thought I was going to need to go to the hospital!   I know with SSRI’s, you’ll need to get through 2-4 weeks before you feel better, but my experience on such a small dose, I can’t imagine going that long feeling like that!   I have a hard time on SSRI’s & basically had similar reactions.  I guess they’re not for me.  Going to try a more natural way out of this",Anonymous

It was so bad I couldn't leave house as I was afraid I would get dizzy and faint if I went any where. I started back on celexa, not sure if I was 20mg or 10mg. Because DR. prescribed 20mg but I think I cut them in half to 10mg. Celexa worked great, the attacks had went away. From what I remember I had no side effects from taking Celexa before. I took it for 2 years and got off. I'm now 32 years old and the panic attacks started again. Today is my 2nd day on celexa 20mg. Side effects are horrible. I feel weird and having panic attacks. Hands, feet sweat, trembling, heart racing, numbness. I've been reading reviews of others are going through the same and they are saying to stick through it as it's great outcome. I called Dr and suggested I half pill to 10mg and take at night instead of morning. I pray for all those facing this battle. We'll get through this in Jesus name.",Anonymous

I had ton of side effects and despised the drug. The doctor urged me to try celexa and I’m  so glad I did. I’ve had zero side effects while on this anxiety medicine and never felt better. I’ve had one episode since I’ve been on this I felt that I was getting stressed but that was short lived. I have completely stopped worrying about little things I shouldn’t be worrying about and my anxiety levels are almost zero. It’s amazing things that I use to stress about doesn’t even bother me anymore. So glad I tried this medication.,Man11
26,Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,,"October 12, 2020",173,"I started Celexa during COVID-19. I always had high anxiety but COVID pushed me over the edge. My anxiety got to the point that I ended up in the hospital with a panic attack. My doctor started me on 20 mg of Celexa. The side effects were a little rough at first and included nausea, some random spasms, trouble sleeping and a feeling of falling shortly after sleep. However, after about 2 weeks they subsided. The positive far out weigh the negatives. My anxiety is under control now. I'm able to live my life without constant worry. Things that used to be major stressors are now tolerable. I sometimes have to be a little careful because I feel like I'm too comfortable and don't worry enough. The one major long term side effect has been the lack of sex drive. Everything functions fine but my drive has been greatly reduced. I also feel like my emotions are slightly muted whereas before I was felt emotions very deeply, now they are slightly less intense.",BubbaSpartan

However, after 2 or 3 weeks the side effects went away almost completely, and now I have none. I am so much less anxious of a person, and just overall way more happy and outgoing! I used to be so anxious about everything but now I feel like I can handle whatever is thrown my way!

I am back on it after trying Prozac which made me nauseous for a year and gave me more anxiety.  Celexa works for me.  It takes away my anxiety.

31,Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,10.0,,"February 26, 2020",193,"To update from my last review:I've been taking it for a month now.  I did only take half (the 5 MG) for a week and now I'm on the 10.   I'm finding my moods to be SO much better already and I can describe my feeling as being ""lighter""... like a grey cloud that was over me for whatever reason is just lighter and I'm more excited to do social things again.  A relationship made my anxiety worse, then I would be moody, that would cause issues and it was a cycle so this has really helped my home life and work life too as things don't bother me.  I will say ... I do feel less motivated at work - I guess just a side affect.  My highs are still high tho, my lows just aren't as low.  I'm friendlier and more positive at work (I just don't feel like doing that much of the boring monotony). Lastly, I can't tell a difference in my sex drive which is good.  If you're anxious or moody, or just feel some heavy unexplained cloud, I definitely recommend trying this!",JessTheMess

The first night I took it I felt really, really high but pretty anxious too so I cut the tablet  in half for 6 days and on the 8th, took a full (10 MG).

After the first night though, I could already tell in my mood swings and I'm sticking with it.  It's not unbearable by any means but I'll check back in after another week to update you!  I would say ... if your side effects are so strong, cut it in half and wait another week.  Almost every negative review is about the first week or two - make it through that, eat healthy and force yourself to exercise (even if you're tired from not sleeping thoroughly the night before).

It has helped me with my ADHD symptoms. I used to be so anxious I couldn't do work, I didn't want to leave the house, I was late for everything, and now I can focus better and not obsess about my performance at work. The first night I got so confused and self conscious but the next day I woke up earlier and with more energy and could function so much better. I am still getting used to it. The way I see it is my brain is relearning how to feel everything, my skin feels weird sometimes, the cold feels different, and my emotions and anxiety (which is still there but manageable), is different. I can still feel things like love, and connection, joy, sadness, guilt, and I can. They are just all less intense and it makes more room for me being able to feel good most days.",Feeling good

40,Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 12, 2019",175,"I started taking Citalopram about about 3 weeks ago for high blood pressure, increasing panic attacks, and generalized inability to keep my adrenaline down to healthy levels.  I've been fighting my doctor about taking mood altering medication because I've been on the slew of Prozac, Paxil, Effexor, etc. a couple of decades ago.  They didn't help and withdrawal was horrific. I am so glad that he talked me into trying Citalopram.  The first day was really rough - gastrointestinal issues that rivalled my IBS, but ALL day.  However, by the second and third day, that went away and a feeling of general well-being started to replace the panic.  It's only been a few weeks, and I know many of the guides say you won't notice a difference right away, but I was lucky.  I did start to notice a change after 1 week.  So far, it's just this side of miraculous for me.  I think I'd forgotten what hope and happiness felt like.",Keighlar

I would panic almost every single day & was only eating a few hundred calories daily (all due to a breakup). Started on  10mg & after that moved up to 20mg. I had diarrhea & a bit of an upset stomach the first two weeks but after that it was gone. After a month the difference in my anxiety was astonishing so I stayed on 20mg. After 2 months I noticed I was still anxious about the breakup (constant thoughts were always in the background). Doctor upped my dosage to 40mg. My anxiety stayed about the same but my depression got much worse. Still having 24/7 background thoughts on the breakup so I’m now on Zoloft and trying that. Celexa may not have worked 100% for me but it made a huge  difference from where I was a few months ago so I’m thankful. I got pretty much zero side effects except for a bit of affected sleep. Would recommend as a good starter SSRI.,braintornado

This was not only scary to me but I was becoming very embarrassed and conscious of this weird memory side effect . The second issue was sleep. My sleep would be almost robotic if that makes sense. I would wake each morning at a certain time and be unable to go back to sleep. It felt like I had not deeply slept during the night and I could feel it upon waking - not necessarily sleepy but rev'd up and unable to sleep in/sleep any further.",didi

I was on the train and I just noticed that my disoriented thoughts and feeling super nervous calmed quite a bit. I did notice I didn't talk as much as I did before I started the medication. It helpsx with my depersonalization. But at the same time it adds fuel to my underlying depression that I had in the past. At the same time I believe that's a good thing. Because it's helping me heal hidden broken parts of myself. It especially helps when talking to my therapist about my past. I hate how tired I am, as I am typing this I think I yawned at least 8 times. Delayed orgasms suck as well...but sometimes I take a day off from taking one pill so it's okay.",brittneywins

I will say you have to give it a good month for it to show it's benefits, and there are side effects in the beginning, but they are minimal and not significant, mostly just yawning and sexual side effects.  Other then that I have found it to be effective. ",Anonymous

I have become forgetful but it's helped me so much not to have anxiety or stress, and helps my Crohn's Disease. So I will stay on it until I feel like I'm forgetting everything.",FUN

I have had a great experience with Celexa. So much so that I am uncertain if I would ever want to be taken off of it.",Anonymous

I felt no difference with this medication, and I was nauseous as a side effect. Doctor switched me to Wellbutrin, which did not work, and then to Effexor, which is a wonder drug.",eseehlk
431,Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,,"February 18, 2009",453,"I have been taking Celexa 20mg for about 3 months for social anxiety disorder and it's worked great so far.  I am much more talkative and social around people.  I don't get shaky and don't dread meeting new people anymore. Someone at my last party asked me if I was high at a party when I hadn't been drinking or anything.  He said usually I am sitting in the corner being anti-social.  I had a touch of nausea when I changed from 10-20 mg, but other than that I do sleep deeper and I think I have less nervous energy than I used to.  I was also yawning uncontrollably for the first month, but I am much more happier.",Anonymous

I still get anxious but I realize it as it begins now and can control the feeling by breathing and taking a walk, which I could not do before.  I also take 25 mg of Xanax at night before bed. Celexa works slowly but I have not had one bad side effect. Eventually my goal is to eliminate the Xanax.",a  woman

It's a lot easier to use the strategies that my psychologist talks about. However, a warning must be given. Celexa has not been a 'magic bullet'. I still have to do a lot of work to not be anxious. However, it has helped me so much that I can't think about quitting any time soon.",Anonymous
