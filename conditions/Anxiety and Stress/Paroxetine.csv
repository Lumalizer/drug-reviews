Both times, Paxil reduced my anxiety until it gradually went away. This medicine really works for me in mitigating anxiety. Cymbalta did not work and Prozac did not work but Paxil worked great.

3,Paroxetine,Anxiety and Stress,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 18, 2021",0,"This drug does work with depression. In fact I was taking 10mg lexapro beforehand until my psychiatrist switched me to paxil. At first I was weary to try since lexapro was doing fine with the depression and anxiety mixed with therapy and Xanax .5mg. I didn’t take the Xanax every day but the anxiety went away. Well now it has come back stronger than ever, creating insomnia and high anxiety. From my past experience with Paxil and anxiety, it didn’t help out much at all, in fact I now have to go up a dosage which I don't like having to go up a dosage with medicine taken everyday. I hope it ends up well, but I will say the only medication the helped with my anxiety is a benzodiazepine such as Xanax. But my doc. took me off and told me to go up to a pill that doesn’t really do much. The issue is I get same results from lexapro as I do Paxil and I spend way less on lexapro than I do on Paxil. It seems to me that Paxil is just an expensive lexapro or fluoxetine option.",Tguy123

When I  get anxious symptom my chest feels tight  and can’t get a full breath of air. At one point I also tried to stop but the situation that makes me anxious still there and my Dr said to continue taking it. I wanted to stop now because I was afraid of the long term effects, but I just read it’s pretty safe. I’ve never had any problems with it. I’ve always taken it at night but in the last week, I’ve started taking it in the morning. I feel fine. I eat more or less healthy and do exercise about 3x a week.

I admit this was worse after a traumatic event in my life. The doctor put me on paroxetine 20mg. I was always wary of taking SSRI meds so to deliberated for a while and check reviews, most of them very good First pill I noticed a little more anxiety than normal and for no reason too. Second pill WALLOP, sudden panic that lasted for many minutes burning skin, total shakes, racing heart and no sleep. It was awful again, these had no reason behind them I was not in an unsafe place nor stressed. The feelings were there out of the blue. It took 5 days to get back to normal. Each day better than the one before. As for sleeping getting there but I did have to take a sleeping pill or two.

Previously I was always a 'Glass half empty' person, and had serious insomnia for months /years even. But almost instantly Paroxetine changed all that and I got lots of restful sleeps and become more positive. However, after about 2 months of taking it I started having really upset tummy, which escalated to the level, that it was impacting my professional life and has become very uncomfortable. I tried changing my diet, nothing worked. Then after a month of trying everything, my GP suggested to tapper off the meds and the discomfort stopped. Now I am back to my low self, I wish I could take this pill again as I haven't had a good night sleep since. Bad luck for reacting like that...",Beatrix
11,Paroxetine,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 4, 2021",1,I have tried almost every antidepressant/anxiety med and this is the only one that has ever worked for me. Once it starts working after about a month or so you finally feel normal. No more obsessive thoughts no more anxiety or depression. I literally feel normal. Something I have never felt. Also I don't have weird side effects. I don't feel like a zombie or spaced out. I feel in the moment and calm and that is all I ever wanted. Weight gain is the only negative but I also eat a lot so not sure if the medicine made me hungry or what. Overall this is the best antidepressant / anti anxiety med I have ever tried and I plan on staying on it for the long haul. The first few weeks sucks you have a head ache and don't feel like it is doing anything. Give it a least a month or two before you make up your mind. This is not one that works right away it has to build up. Glad I stayed on it!,I love it

14,Paroxetine,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,,"May 16, 2021",4,I have been on this for 4-5 years dosages between 10-40mg depending on my stress/GAD. I have tried Pristiq (2 weeks) and Lovan/Prozac (3weeks) but these increased my anxiety dramatically. Pros: It's the only antidepressant that's worked long term for me. I found this medication to be really safe. I used to have anxiety every second day and just a nervous manner but I don't now. I used to have insomnia for nearly a year before I started this med. Cons: There can be withdrawal symptoms but mine weren't that bad (headaches and some depressed days) nothing that wasn't manageable. I did my tapering off over 2 months.  I did notice slight sexual and emotional blunting when taking the higher dose of this. Nothing that would ruin my quality of life though or make me consider discontinuing this though.,Thbddyjbcs

Yes there is a euphoric feeling but it’s not long lasting and once your body metabolizes the drug that’ll go away.

I developed tinnitus and noise sensitivity 5 years ago (caused by loud noise) after which my anxiety progressively got worse. My hearing problems triggered my anxiety constantly and I cried almost every day. I was just so angry at life. I tried countless methods in order to find peace (CBT, EMDR, hypnotherapy and psychotherapy), none of which worked. But then I started taking 10 mg of Paroxetine. My anxiety and anger suddenly became so much milder. I still struggle with my hearing, but it doesn't bother me so much anymore. Paroxetine has also helped tremendously with my social anxiety. I don't get so nervous around people anymore and I can just enjoy a conversation without monitoring myself.The only downside for me are the night sweats.

I was on 20mg but with my new job I started getting anxiety but didn’t want to raise the dosage because it caused me difficult to orgasm. Thus for 5 months I’ve tried two other drugs Venlafax and now Brinttellix. It seems they don't really work for me. I’m planning to go back on paroxetine just with a higher dose.

26,Paroxetine,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"February 13, 2020",8,"This medication is effective however it causes weight gain and the withdrawal is horrendous. I went off the medication because of the weight gain. I suffered horrible withdrawal  including panic attacks, chest pain, and  depression.  I lost 30 pounds fast but developed health anxiety and fear. I went back on the medication just a few a months later.  I felt better after a few weeks but I gained the weight back and it’s the one thing I hate about this medication but it’s what works for me. I don’t recommend paroxetine as a first choice. Try other medications because once again the weight gain is unavoidable because the hunger pangs are constant. It also causes fatigue but the fatigue isn’t overwhelming and I never experienced nausea. Overall, it’s an effective medication.",Sam
27,Paroxetine,Anxiety and Stress,8.0,,"January 25, 2020",21,"Paxil (paroxetine):I have taken Paxil twice.  Once in my twenties and I'm currently on it again in my early 40s and for different reasons. Having gone through the withdrawal before I can tell you that it is difficult and you should not do it without being under the watchful eye of a dr.  My main side effect is sexual, which in my 20's worked well.  Now that I'm older, the delay in ejaculation is fine however the lack of feeling isn't great.  Normally, you can feel the semen rising up through your urethra but on Paxil you can't.  It still feels good to orgasm but not the same.  After I got off of it last time I became so sensitive that two thrusts and I would explode.  Not good for the ladies although my wife always said she didn't care.  At this point, my agreement with my dr. is that I'm going on the drug for a short period and will begin my tapering again soon.  I will say that this does keep me from getting aura migraines and it is wonderful not to have those.",Rotag

I was recently convinced by my doctor to try an SSRI again because my anxiety has gotten much worse this year. This morning, I took my first 20mg dose of paroxetine. This was one of the worse experiences of my life. For me, the side effects were too severe. My anxiety was worse than it has ever been causing several full blown panic attacks in which I couldn't breathe and fainted, I had vertigo so bad I couldn't move my head at all without vomiting, the drowsiness was so bad and my reactions and thoughts were so slow I felt like I had been roofied. In addition to this, I was having graphic, vivid, mental images. I tried to sleep because I was so groggy but sleep never came, only terrible horrific images.

A word of warning if when initially started the side effects are not bearable- see your doctor don’t search the internet. Good luck !",Rojam

I'd been changing meds because of the feeling of swaying, off balance, vibrating sensation under my feet.

I start on 20mg and am told the first week to start with a half a pill once a day. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disease and mild anxiety. I could not stop yawning. I felt tired all the time. I didn't notice any weight gain like others that have taken the medicine, but I could not deal with the extreme euphoria. I felt like I was floating through life in bubble if that makes any sense.",Nikimari

I had become house-bound by several debilitating panic attacks every day.  I have been on Paxil for close to a year, and it is still working.  Side effects I experienced were bruising for the first few months.  I also experienced numbness and tingling (my arms and legs started falling asleep all the time).  I began taking magnesium supplements and the tingling stopped.  I am still experiencing weight gain and tiredness and constant yawning, as well as decreased focus and memory.  I am also unable to orgasm, which is strange for me because I used to be able to reach orgasm very easily.  Overall, I can work and live again so it's worth the side effects.",Anonymous

It is a drug that I had to get used to for about 3 weeks each time the doctor increased the strength.  At first, I felt ""groggy"" and ""spacey"".  Over time, it helps sooooo much with anxiety, irritability, anger-intense reactions, organizing my mind and allowing me to RELAX.  I have, at times, missed a day's dose and YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.  The following day, I was very anxious and irritable until taking it again.  I think it is a fantastic drug that has given me my life back.  I think my kids and my husband have benefitted from me being calmer, happier and able to ""roll with life"" better.  I take 40 mg. and it was initially prescribed by my gynocolgist for hormone based mood swings.  Love it.!",Anonymous

Doesn't sound that bad, except I've been going to the gym like crazy to counteract this side effect and still the scale keeps creeping up.  I have almost zero interest in having sex and when I do have sex, I cannot have an orgasm. Any interest in sex I do have is counteracted by the fact that I feel gross having gained extra weight.  If I were single, I might not mind the sex issue as much, but if you are in a relationship, I would consider a different drug.",Anonymous

156,Paroxetine,Anxiety and Stress,9.0,,"January 11, 2009",16,I am 41 years old and never took a drug in my life. I am a normal father of two teenagers with a very good job...basically what I thought was very normal life. I started getting what I now know are panic attacks on a more frequent basis. I had a serious issue one day driving over a bridge to the point where I couldn't drive over tall bridges...ridiculous right. Well I finally went to the doctor and have been taking Paxil for 1 year without any side effects. I have not had a panic attack since beginning on the medication and my moods are much more consistent. I still have a bit of fear with the bridges but rather than increase the dose I can deal with it. I would recommend this to anyone because I could not address this situation prior.,Anonymous
