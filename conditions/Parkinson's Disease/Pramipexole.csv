0,Pramipexole,Parkinson's Disease,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 10, 2022",0,"Mirapex ER (pramipexole):Diagnosed at age 48 with Parkinson’s although I remember resting tremor began at 39. In the beginning on pramipexole I would feel faint when standing up and I admit that was scary but that went away quickly. I still feel drowsy - often with sleep attacks despite being on it for 2 years.Having said that, it is worth it because the resting tremor and anhedonia is gone. I can enjoy life again to the fullest. What I liked the best was when I asked my neurologist about the ER version (0.75mg). It’s so easy to only have to take 1 tablet a day and I feel like I’m on a more even keel. I never had any compulsive behavior but found that I enjoy online shopping. Nothing devastating of course.Thank goodness for pramipexole. Life is great!",Rick
1,Pramipexole,Parkinson's Disease,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"February 22, 2022",1,"Mirapex (pramipexole):Terrible side effects included a gambling compulsion. Felt compelled to buy stacks and stacks of lottery tickets despite never being into gambling. Lost impulse control, leading to some terrible decision-making that I couldn't stop even as I saw how it was negatively affecting my family. Building a life for decades seemed to be lost almost overnight... out of my control. And the only change was the use of Mirapex.",Bill Thomas
2,Pramipexole,Parkinson's Disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 29, 2021",4,"This drug and other dopamine agonists are a complete nightmare for me. We were devastated with the impulse control disorders or compulsive behaviours (Shopping, eating) these drugs cause. It ruined our family completely. Please refrain from using dopamine agonists. It will destroy your life by causing a lot of psychiatric problems. These come as side effects of the drug.",RedFox777
3,Pramipexole,Parkinson's Disease,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"September 16, 2020",8,Mirapex ER (pramipexole):Besides Mirapex ER causing compulsive behavior(shopping) as a side effect it seemed to be working fairly well. I was taking the 4.5 mg dose for Parkinson’s. But when my neurologist passed away suddenly I had to switch doctors. She completely changed my medicine. It’s been almost a month and it half and I’m in the worse shape I’ve b ever ugh  been in. Withdrawal for my brain had been unimaginable.,slmom89
4,Pramipexole,Parkinson's Disease,9.0,,"November 23, 2019",10,"Mirapex (pramipexole):It seems almost miraculous to me. I  have been on it only a couple of days but my balance is improved, I can move more easily, even my neuropathy seems slightly better",pmm

6,Pramipexole,Parkinson's Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 19, 2018",8,Mirapex (pramipexole):I tried it for one day and the side effects made me bedridden for almost 2 days. I felt so nauseous and extremely drowsy. Had a headache and then felt weak. I can't take this again,Marie
7,Pramipexole,Parkinson's Disease,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 14, 2018",10,"Mirapex ER (pramipexole):The Mirapex ER saved my sanity!!! I had restless legs so bad, mainly at night, and my legs would jump so hard I would come close to falling off the bed.  It was terrible.  Mirapex ER came to my rescue.  Have been on it for several years and am thankful for how it works.",Ghm

9,Pramipexole,Parkinson's Disease,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"June 17, 2017",12,Mirapex ER (pramipexole):Diagnosed in 2010 at 46yo - I have been using Mirapex Er .75 1x day for several years with minimal issues/problems - It can have a lot of side effects so it is not for everybody.  Ok.. so I've seen a few ghosts along the way... (at the time was at a higher dose of 1.25mg per day) - I haven't seen any since lowering the dose to the current .75 level.Although you can get the fast acting non ER version - you really need the ER version to keep it in your system longer to receive the benefit of it.  For me it helps to minimize the cramping I get in my right foot.My insurance will not cover this drug.  I ran across this Mirapex assistance site (Eagle Pharmacy / Lakeland FL) where I can get Mirapex ER for $30 a month without insurance.,mjbaz2002
10,Pramipexole,Parkinson's Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 17, 2017",5,Was using Mirapex Er .75 1x day for several months with no problems/issues.  Insurance company decided that it would no longer cover the brand name Mirapex ER - so I was switched to the generic.  I took my regular dose before going to bed... and woke up a few hours later in stark terror thinking that the kid from the Omen movie standing beside my bed.  I had to get up and turn every light in the house on and watch TV - trying to not let the paranoia get the best of me. About 3am it was like a switch was flipped and everything returned to normal - I turned off all the lights and went back to bed.  I am unable to take this generic.,mjbaz2002
11,Pramipexole,Parkinson's Disease,1.0,,"August 30, 2013",43,"Mirapex (pramipexole):I was recently diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. I was started on Mirapex, after 3 weeks of therapy I had to stop due to severe side effects: auditive hallucinations, nausea, peripheral edema, muscle pain, vivid dreams and the worst, difficulty sleeping having the need to get up and move constantly.I'm sure that this is a very good medication but I couldn't tolerate the side effects",xanti
12,Pramipexole,Parkinson's Disease,9.0,,"December 22, 2012",40,"Mirapex ER (pramipexole):Mirapex was prescribed on Dec. 3, 2012, for my stage II Parkinson's Disease. From the first week (0.375mg only), all but a few of my symptoms were mitigated. Only a few minor side effects, which disappeared once I went to 0.75 MG for a week. Now at 1.5 MG. Easy to take, easy to swallow. I take after I've eaten a banana or piece of bread to avoid nausea.",DistanceMan
13,Pramipexole,Parkinson's Disease,10.0,,"October 9, 2010",62,"Mirapex (pramipexole):I was unable to walk, dress myself, cook, write, or barely function. My family doctor was treating me for mini-strokes but finally agreed I should see a neurologist. He started me on Mirapex that day as he could tell that I had Parkinson's by my appearance and actions. I have been on 1.5 mg 3 times a day for a year and am back to living again. I dread to think of where I would be without Mirapex. I don't have any side effects.",Laura 428

16,Pramipexole,Parkinson's Disease,8.0,,"April 20, 2009",71,"Mirapex (pramipexole):I was started on Mirapex for Parkinson's Disease. I have horrible pain, stiffness, tremors, headaches, dizziness and the list goes on. I had been confined to bed for nearly a year due to my complications. The very day I began taking the Mirapex we began to see improvement. As my dosage was increased I continued to show more and more improvement.  Mirapex is giving me my life back...slowly but surely!  The only complications I have are when my dosage is increased. I have slight nausea and tiredness but other than that I have had no other side effects.",PDMom
