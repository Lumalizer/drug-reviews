Dr. suggested stopping for a week, then try half patch. After 6 days, agitation, irritability, with confusion and paranoia. No more patches and over $246 down the drain. (generic cost)",Ali
1,Rivastigmine,Parkinson's Disease,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 2, 2020",12,"The neurologist started my husband on this pill  rivastigmine 6 weeks ago, starting with one 1.5 mg pill at night , two weeks later two pills and then three pills after 4 weeks.  He never got to the three pill level.  After he started taking them he progressively got worse and worse, agitation, hallucinations (which he never had before) not sleeping..crazy dreams and talking all night...I didnâ€™t connect this with the new pills immediately, I should have, after 5 weeks and him getting more and more intimidating I finally thought of these pills.  Called the dr. and we went back to one pill for one night and then off completely.  It took two days, but finally he stared to settle down. Now he is fine...10 days later. My suggestion?Never take this pill!!!!!",Julie
2,Rivastigmine,Parkinson's Disease,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 27, 2018",8,"My mother was given these patches and steadily become aggressive, paranoid, depressed, confused, tired but not sleeping properly and most worrying constant visual hallucinations. She was hospitalised for over two months and recovered to her old self. We believe there is some kind of build up which results in these side effects. She is now off of the patches and we are already seeing a significant improvement",maitlandgirl
3,Rivastigmine,Parkinson's Disease,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 18, 2014",29,Exelon (rivastigmine):My husband has Parkinson's dementia and was put on Exelon patch 4 months ago.  He has psoriasis and the patch (we think) may have triggered it to be worse.  He does not want to stop the patch because of the good mental alertness he receives from it but the rash has become more widespread on his upper torso.  Doctor does not believe it is Exelon but I have begun to remove the patch after 12 hours and the rash has improved.  I believe the dose may be too high and causes the dermatitis.  Overall it is a good medicine.,normasims
4,Rivastigmine,Parkinson's Disease,1.0,,"January 12, 2011",70,"Exelon (rivastigmine):My mother has been on this medication for 2 1/2 weeks.  With each day she has become more and more agitated, confused, confrontational, and delusional.  I am taking her off of it.  It may be that this medicine is better suited for Alzheimer's patients than Parkinson's patients.",Anonymous
