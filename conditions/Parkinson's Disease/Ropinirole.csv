2,Ropinirole,Parkinson's Disease,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 8, 2020",10,"Ropinirole is, for me, a miracle drug, I take if for Drug-induced Parkinsonism/Fibromyalgia/RLS. The subjective effects are very similar to Xanax, even though the pharmacology is totally different. I am surprised that it is not FDA approved for insomnia, anxiety, depression, and pain management. However, I fear that if this drug garners too much attention, it is likely to become a schedule IV medication, like benzodiazepines. It is so difficult to get any prescription medication that actually works, that isn’t controlled. I have had absolutely NO side effects. It is the most effective drug for the muscle spasms from fibromyalgia. In conjunction with diazepam, it relieves my RLS symptoms, and helps me fall asleep easily and wake up feeling rested. For me no side effects of  gambling, promiscuous sexual activity, or driving while sleeping either.",Louis Cyphre
3,Ropinirole,Parkinson's Disease,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 5, 2018",21,"Requip (ropinirole):Diagnosed with Early Onset Parkinsons Disease in the fall of 2009 @ the age of 47, I was prescribed the drug Requip. God, family, & friends were the most important things in my life prior to taking the medicine. I was very conservative with my $ and spent approximately a total of $10 on the lottery & made 2 trips to a Casino spending $20 in my lifetime. After taking this medication for approximately 3 months in the fall of 2009, I developed an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) with scratch off lottery tickets & slot machines. To make a long story short, after risking loosing my family, soul, friends and losing hundreds of thousands of dollars, the decision to take Requip was a mistake.    Compulsive gambling is a listed side effect.",takenadvantageof
4,Ropinirole,Parkinson's Disease,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 13, 2018",7,"I was anxious to the point that I wanted to jump out of my skin. Sinemet managed tremors but I couldn't function at times because of clenched fists with my arms flexed and rubbing my hands together. Initially I took two ropinirole daily (one in morning and one at bedtime), anxiety was gone in two days but I was extremely exhausted in the afternoon. Now I take both doses at bedtime and the tiredness (not sleepiness) is reduced. Still, some days I barely make it back home, so exhausted.",Young66

7,Ropinirole,Parkinson's Disease,9.0,,"December 17, 2011",35,"Requip XL (ropinirole):Requip has given me 4 years of regained fine motor skills, word retrieval and executive functioning. It has been the only medicine I have taken for my parkinson 's disease. The disease marches on, but I can drive, work with young children and take care of myself. I have been blessed, even though each day I can feel the loss of automaticity and coordination. Requip has caused narcolepsy and visual hallucinations that have been quite unique, not scary!",janaleese

13,Ropinirole,Parkinson's Disease,,,"November 11, 2008",14,Sinemet worked great for many years but eventually I started to have dyskenesia from it. I was able to lower my dosage of sinemet by adding requip. Now I have the same drug benefit without the side effects from using high doses of Sinemet alone.,flynncarb
