3,Amantadine,Parkinson's Disease,10,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"October 31, 2019",8,"I was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD) more than 6 years ago. The tremors started affecting my left hand at first, 3 years later it affected my left leg causing me to walk funny( jerking movements) every time I taking levodopa/ cabridopa. In April 2017, I had deep brain stimulation (DBS) procedure done. DBS helps me tremendously but I still have to take levodopa/cabridopa 3 times a day, maximum dose: 25 mg/100mg x2 . I try amantadine but no help. Start with Gocorvi (amantadine) was since early 2018 and I begin cut down the levodopa by half about 6 months later. Today October 31, 2019, I have stop taking levodopa completely for several months, at least 2 months now, and still feel great. The tremors will comeback if I forgot to take Gocorvi the night before, and if I take levodopa to control the tremors then my left leg will walk funny.",Dentist
4,Amantadine,Parkinson's Disease,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 30, 2019",17,My husband starting taking Amantadine three weeks ago. After one week of this med he started to hallucinate which wasn't too bad at first. Today was his worst day with constant hallucinations all day long. I was scared he had the beginnings of Dementia or Alzheimer's. Called his neurologist who said to slowly cut back on his Amantadine and then stop it completely. So relieved to find out the problem was his med. Once the med is out of his system he should be okay. Will make sure he never takes Amantadine again!,BadHallucinations

10,Amantadine,Parkinson's Disease,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 16, 2014",20,I have to say I noticed the wiggles disappeared after the first dose - I hope this continues to work. I did get a brief dizzy spell after the second dose but it quickly passed.,MagicMom
11,Amantadine,Parkinson's Disease,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 22, 2013",41,"Symmetrel (amantadine):I hear that it only works in 50% of people who take it. I must be one of the lucky ones. Taking it along with Sinemet really takes care of me. And, no dosage shifting, plus slows down dyskinesia from Sinemet. You can take a ""medication holiday"" with this medicine and restart in a few days, to reinvent the good results, or test to see if it is working for you.",perkie parkie
