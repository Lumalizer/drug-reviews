0,Carbidopa and levodopa,Parkinson's Disease,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 18, 2022",0,"Rytary (carbidopa / levodopa):It took awhile to find the right dose of Rytary so the start of this drug was pretty rocky. I take 3 of the 23.75/95 capsules 4 times a day and have no wear off and no side effects! It's pretty amazing considering with Sinemet and C/L CR I was having nausea and frequent wear off. If you can get through the frustration of having to deal with tremor, stiffness, slowness and stuff while you're finding the right dose- it's so worth it when you get there. Rytary is smooth and just holds steady. No peaks and valleys. It just works and keeps working until the next dose kicks in. Awesome. I've never felt better!!!!",Sar

Since I have been on this medication my tremors and shuffling gait have improved dramatically. Before starting my body movements were  virtually uncontrollable. Now I can function almost normally. Sinement also allowed me to return to work after being unable to work for about 8 months. Granted I can not do the same job I was doing (Nurse) but I am able to work in an administrative function.

I personally think he was overmedicated by his doctor.  He hadn't experienced dyskinesia yet and within the second day of Rytary, it was so bad we were worried he would break his teeth due to how he was tightening his jaw and grinding his teeth.  He had only experienced a psychosis twice within his 10 year diagnosis, and every single day he was suffering from a psychosis; irritable, argumentative, paranoid, angry and extremely sensitive when he would talk about his past.  Almost as his personality had completely changed with Rytary.  I'm not sure if he will continue it because he's gotten worse mentally and emotionally, it's a lot for us, caregivers.  Physically he's walking better and sleeping a tad better.  I think Rytary needs to require a psychological exam before being prescribed this medication for Parkinson's.",K.M

This was a massive overdose. This caused a Manic(invincable) state. I am NOT Manic depressive. I knew something was wrong, when I was mean, to my wife, who I have never, disrespected before, ever. It took me 40 years to find her and this drug not only removed my impulse control, but also brought out aggressiveness. As a Former US Marine, my self discipline was simply absent.So, I bought a digital scale capable of weight in mg. Most of the capsules weigh 330mg, after removing the gel capsule, most pills contain 240mg of ""beads"". About 1 in 30 pills have about 50% more, upto 340mg.

11,Carbidopa and levodopa,Parkinson's Disease,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 12, 2020",20,"Rytary (carbidopa / levodopa):I started taking Rytary 3 1/2 years ago because the increased doses of Simenet were beginning to cause dyskinesia. For me, it's been terrific! The slow release really works and the dyskinesia happens very seldom and when it happens, it's mild. Since I started, the dose has increased and I have gone from 3x per day to 4x per day. So, it works for me. Many of the other criticisms I have read are simply due to the natural progression of the disease, not to mention certain meds work for some PWP's and not others. It's just like Parkinson's itself, almost everyone experiences different total symptoms. Bottom line, if you respond well to Simenet and the doses are starting to kick in dyskinesia, I highly recommend Rytary.",Eric

First dose he took at night (after his first 2 doses of CL- morning and mid afternoon) he was able to sleep all night and had more strength in his left leg. But 2 1/2 wks later he started hallucinating and seeing goats and people talking and hanging out the living room window.  His stress level was up and he had the worst shakes. He was restless and little sleep. Neuro said to give him dose with food but my mom and my dad were exhausted of the hallucinations and little sleep. So we skipped his evening dose of Rytary and he slept all night till late morning and we gave him CL again and this time 2 pills 3 x a day. Still monitoring him to see how he does. I wonder if we can give him CL and then one dose of Rytary in evening??,Alma

44,Carbidopa and levodopa,Parkinson's Disease,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 28, 2013",133,"Sinemet (carbidopa / levodopa):My mom has been on generic Sinemet for 8 weeks, and her improvement is remarkable. She's 86, and until the last 18 months, she had never taken any medication and was energetic and bubbly. She had a dramatic and fast onset of Parkinson's, and prior to starting this medication, she was almost completely debilitated. She looked like she was slowly dying. She lost a lot of weight, was shuffling, stooped in posture, exhausted, and confused. We took her to a neurologist who started the Sinemet slowly over a series of three-day incremental increases, and she started showing improvement almost immediately. She now takes 1 tablet three times a day (25/100). Zero side effects. And, now, two months into this, she's 75% back! It's a miracle!",Dottie's daughter

I am a carer for my wife who is extremely disabled, thus I needed a medication which allowed me to still manage her needs whilst controlling my Parkinson's.  CR has worked and although I have  episodes of trembling as I get nearer the end of an 6 hour  medication cycle I am very happy with it as I am  able to tend to my wife's medical needs  and carry out cooking duties as required.",michmal
