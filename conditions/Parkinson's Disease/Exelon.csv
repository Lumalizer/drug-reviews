0,Exelon,Parkinson's Disease,8,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 18, 2014",29,My husband has Parkinson's dementia and was put on Exelon patch 4 months ago.  He has psoriasis and the patch (we think) may have triggered it to be worse.  He does not want to stop the patch because of the good mental alertness he receives from it but the rash has become more widespread on his upper torso.  Doctor does not believe it is Exelon but I have begun to remove the patch after 12 hours and the rash has improved.  I believe the dose may be too high and causes the dermatitis.  Overall it is a good medicine.,normasims

With each day she has become more and more agitated, confused, confrontational, and delusional.  I am taking her off of it.  It may be that this medicine is better suited for Alzheimer's patients than Parkinson's patients.",Anonymous
