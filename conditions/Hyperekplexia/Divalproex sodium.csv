With Depakote, my condition is, for the most part, held in check, and even when I do fall on occasion, it is greatly reduced in intensity.  I have gained about five pounds, but what a small price to pay!  Incidentally, I take 250mg morning and night and take no other medications for the condition.",Judy I.
