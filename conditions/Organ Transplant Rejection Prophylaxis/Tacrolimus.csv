0,Tacrolimus,Organ Transplant Rejection Prophylaxis,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 26, 2021",0,"I’ve been taking prograf/tacro for a long time. Maybe started the pill when I was 5 years old? Cyclosporine made me look like an animal- from the pictures I've seen of myself! I’ve had my transplanted liver for just about 28 years, never had any complications. Glory to God! No side effects for me with this medication- taking 1 mg/2xday (both pills at night). That’s not how the meds was prescribed, but I had poor habits as a teen taking this and the routine stuck. I do not recommend anyone else to follow suite! Haha just giving my experience. I’m thankful for this medicine!",Holly

2,Tacrolimus,Organ Transplant Rejection Prophylaxis,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 24, 2020",3,I’ve experienced that different manufacturers can effect your Tacrolimis (Tac) levels in bloodwork.  I have to ask pharmacist for brand specific Tac.   I’ve been on it 2 1/2 years post liver transplant and have had no problems except high levels when they changed the manufacturer at the pharmacy.,PJ

So far, it's working well.Side effects include continuous stomach distress, usually ranging from mild to moderate, with occasional severe flare-ups; mild tremors; mild blood glucose elevation; occasional mild numbness in hand.For me, the side effects are well worth keeping my kidney from rejecting.",survivor
4,Tacrolimus,Organ Transplant Rejection Prophylaxis,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 8, 2019",3,"I despise tacrolimus! It's caused me to go on insulin whereas I was in pills first. I shake often. And worst of all, it's destroying my kidneys. It's hard on that organ. I'm 9 years out from a  Cystic Fibrosis double lung transplant  and I truly hate this drug. If I ever need a second transplant, I'll think twice because I know what program has done to me.",Ashley
5,Tacrolimus,Organ Transplant Rejection Prophylaxis,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 24, 2019",7,"Prograf (tacrolimus):I just had the worst time with this medication! I had severe diarrhea, we are talking 20 times in one day. It gave me the worst migraines. They would last for days. They would cause me to vomit. When I was in the hospital they would give me IV pain meds and I still had the crippling migraines. All I wanted to do was lay in bed. It worked great as preventing rejection. However I felt so sick I was not living. I lost a ton of weight. I was never hungry.. and when I did eat it all just came right back out. I had a lot of edema in my legs and feet. I begged to be on something different and switched to cyclosporine. This medication was just plain awful. I'd rather live my whole life on dialysis than to ever take this again!",Steph

I EXERCISE AT LEAST 1 1/2 HRS DAILY, MY DIET IS EXCELLENT AND I'M A MODEL PATIENT. Yet my post transplant diabetes is out of control.

11,Tacrolimus,Organ Transplant Rejection Prophylaxis,,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 14, 2017",7,"Prograf (tacrolimus):Itching was bad in lower legs especially my ankles for a few months after liver transplant in June 2016.  I had hand trembling where it was hard to write or hold things steady like utensils for several months. These cleared up about 3 months out from transplant.  Also, though lesser in degree was dizziness, confusion, tingling in legs, prickly feeling in legs, fatigue, loss of taste, urination about every hour at night.  These decreased or ceased after 4 months.  I have put back on weight (40 lbs) that I needed to put on and am now stable at a healthy weight.Overall, taking prograf now, one year out, is good.

I was on Prograf for the longest amount of time and had since been switched over to the generic. I had noticed for quite a while however that I do suffer from tremors and lately I have been having the feeling of eye twitching which is slightly annoying to me but I can not complain as without God and my medicine I would not be here to share this.

I have been taking Prograf and Myfortic since transplant with very few side effects that I am aware of. I have returned to work  12 months. The only side effect that I have a problem with is sleeping. I am a contractor, and many times it is a manual type of job, so I do need sleep, which I only get 5hrs/night if I am lucky.
