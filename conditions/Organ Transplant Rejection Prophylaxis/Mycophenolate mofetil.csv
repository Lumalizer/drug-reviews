0,Mycophenolate mofetil,Organ Transplant Rejection Prophylaxis,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 4, 2021",0,I think this is the immunosuppressive drug with least side effects. Good to reduce prednisolone and tacrolimus. For stomach related issues can take psyllium husk. If you are fatigue try checking cmv infection.,mishu
1,Mycophenolate mofetil,Organ Transplant Rejection Prophylaxis,3.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 29, 2020",0,"CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil):I am having severe diarrhea on Cellcept which has my electrolytes out of whack to the point of having to go to the local ED for fluids and supplements. I'm taking 2g daily in 4 doses. The more I drink, the worse it gets so I am in a catch-22 situation. I am also on Envarsus and prednisone as anti-rejection meds. I'm also taking Septra which may be contributing to my problem.",Bad reaction

3,Mycophenolate mofetil,Organ Transplant Rejection Prophylaxis,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 6, 2020",4,"CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil):Cellcept is easier on your kidneys than Prograf so that is a plus.  It can increase your risk of cancer which is scary.  But if I had the choice I would be on Cellcept instead of Prednisone.  It does cause depression and anxiety for some people and I am one of them.  But almost all of the transplant drugs do.    Prednisone seems to be the worst of the bunch though.  Weight gain, blood pressure goes up some on this, insomnia, tiredness is a big one.  But you have to take something.  I don't know about all of the alternatives to this drug, but if it doesn't work then ask.  I will say my biggest problem with the drug has been that I developed the BK virus which is dangerous and I had to come off of Cellcept to allow body to fight the virus.  So that is something to watch.  Take your pills - it is better than rejection or damage.  But always ask for alternatives.  Pricey so go with generic!",damandalyn
