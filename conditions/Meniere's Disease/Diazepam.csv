Since then I have had neck pain and stiffness, head pressure as well as tinnitus and clogged ears that pop all on and off except tinnitus which is constant. Finally gave in and tried the diazepam 5mg I was prescribed because I don't like taking meds. It was an absolute game changer. While taking it neck pain and stiffness got better as well as the other symptoms. So thankful this helped so I can get back to living a normal day.",Lexi845

3,Diazepam,Meniere's Disease,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 20, 2021",2,"I came across this site and wanted to share my experience.  I was prescribed 2 mg Diazepam as needed over 4 years ago for Meniere's.  Yes it works for vertigo and vomiting, however the side effects of becoming physically dependent on Valium are far worse. I was caught up in the Valium withdrawal nightmare which took me a year of tapering to wean off the drug.   Keep in mind, I was taking the drug as prescribed by my physician and on a very low dose of 2mg.  Do the research on the risks of taking Valium long term before going down this awful road.",Drhagerma

8,Diazepam,Meniere's Disease,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 14, 2020",43,"23 yrs ago I woke up and felt high. Diagnosed with Meniere’s , Mal de barkment?, Horrible Tinnitus, Anxiety/ Panic attacks, allergy issues & depersonalization as well, hence the high feeling. The 1st. 7 yrs. I struggled thru Zoloft, Lexapro, allergy meds & back surgery until 1 day a friend told me to ask my Dr. to try Valium. Game Changer!!  After the very 1st 5mg dose of diazepam I felt a sense of calm for 2 days that I had not felt in 7 yrs. The last 16 yrs I don’t think I would’ve made it if it weren’t for Mother’s Little Helper.  Over time I’ve gone from 5mg daily to 10mg, my body craved more based on my symptoms worsening. Still I get panic/anxiety attacks once in a while but they have never sent me to hospital like during those initial 7 yrs of suffering.  I’m turning 50 soon and planning to somehow make it till the end with Diazepam's help! Good Luck to you all!!",Don’t fly without it!!

Now, he’s convinced that he needs to take the Beta- histine if he wants to live a normal life.  Beta histone can be compounded if you find a pharmacy that will do that with a Drs prescription.  The first several Drs he saw weren’t willing to do that, so you have to keep searching to find a Dr to work with you.",Tuna

18,Diazepam,Meniere's Disease,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 22, 2018",15,I suffered with the worst vertigo for a couple yrs till the dr gave me valium. It worked wonders I was fine as long as I took three 5 mg tablets every day. In the process of switching Dr I went without all my prescriptions for 2 months. I've been taking atarax for my allergies for 17 years which happens to be the same 17 yrs I've had meniere's. I'm 98% convinced my meniere's is allergy medicine induced.

19,Diazepam,Meniere's Disease,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 16, 2018",38,I was diagnosed with vertigo 17 years ago. It was not as bad as it has been the past 6 years. It would come and go several times a year. Now the past 5 years it had been really bad. I couldn't even leave the house for work until the sun came up. So bad it makes you feel that there are serious problems in your life. If I turn the lights off I would hit the floor. I started taken valium about 5 years ago. It is the only thing that helps. I take 5 mg once a week sometimes twice. This had changed my life a lot. It is still bad at times but manageable with valium. Now all the doctors makes you feel  you have done something wrong just to get a prescription. I'm 62 years old. And do not know what I would do if I can get a prescription.,Bill

23,Diazepam,Meniere's Disease,,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 18, 2017",28,I suffered along with many young G.I.'s at Ft. Jackson SC who from an attack of Viral meningitis that hospitalized those of us affected for two to three weeks. Suffered progressive ringing in one ear and eventual total functional hearing loss. Military Dr's wrote it off as affect of change in humidity etc.  Diagnosed with Meniere's syndrome 8 years later. Rx'd 5mg diazepam prn and have been using sporadically ever since. The Rx stops the spinning dizziness before nausea sets in.  IT WORKS !  I am 72 now and have been using it when needed for 36 years now. It does little for the ear buzzing/ringing and fullness. But does wonders for the dizziness and prevents nausea and vomiting.,Anonymous

If I wake up and I am dizzy or if I'm dizzy for an extended period of time before taking diazepam, the diazepam works for a few hours but the dizziness comes back.  I do get sleepy with the medication because I don't take it very frequently but I am able to work while taking it unless I have to take multiple doses and then I am extremely groggy.

My ear doctor gave me valium to treat the ear instead of surgery he did not think surgery would help after a month of vertigo.  Afterwards I had a fear whether  it will come back.

I later discovered by taking 20mg of Furosemide and 5mg of Valium in the morning would keep me from having any attacks for over 3 years. I feel like I'm blessed.
