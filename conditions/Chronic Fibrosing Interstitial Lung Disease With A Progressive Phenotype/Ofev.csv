1,Ofev,Chronic Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease With A Progressive Phenotype,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 21, 2021",5,"Started taking this 2 months ago @150mg, 2xday.  It has got rid of my appetite and taste. I get mild nausea and some headaches. Worst of it is that I have horrible fatigue. I was feeling fairly well before lung biopsy and starting Ofev.  Energy was good with minimal shortness of breath. Now I wake up exhausted.  DR considering lowering my dose. I can't yet say if the medicine has been effective til my next scan.",KANSAS CITY
