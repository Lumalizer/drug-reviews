0,Risperdal,Asperger Syndrome,2,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 7, 2020",10,"Risperdal made me gain 40 pounds in less than 3 months. It also somehow caused a psychotic episode when I first started it. I was prescribed for irritability in autism not psychosis/schizophrenia. It was one of the scariest experiences of my life. I suffered through depersonalization, paranoia, and unshakeable beliefs for a couple weeks. I also had movement issues and brain fog. I switched to another anti-psychotic and lost the weight but the effects following the psychotic episode lingered for 6-8 weeks.",SnakeDog
1,Risperdal,Asperger Syndrome,1,,"May 26, 2019",47,"My son was given risperidone at ~age 6. Took it for 2 weeks.  He became a blob.  Sure, the teachers loved it.  He was sweet, not hyper, easy to manage.  Downside? Yeah, he was a blob of a kid just sitting there dull as can be and then on his tiny frame gained TEN POUNDS IN TWO WEEKS.  Two.  He couldn't even put his jeans on! OMG. I took him off of it... and he was back to being hyper, laughing, fun but annoying.  So, suck it up, teachers.  He just is what he is.  Needless to say today, a few years later, after ABA therapy and other therapy he's just fine.  Stay away.  I also found out that Risperdal causes boys to sprout breasts and lactate. The next psych we had said NEVER put a boy on that medication... they grow breasts.  So yeah, not a good med for us.",MommyOne
2,Risperdal,Asperger Syndrome,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 9, 2019",19,"This drug for me was horrific. I was on it a couple of years ago and after only being on it a couple of weeks I ended up in hospital with a high fever and severe confusion , the doctors thought at first I had meningitis bit it turns out I was having a bad reaction to drug. I couldn't remember a lot of things and had kidney problems. The medical staff were very rude and secretive about my reaction the the drug. PLEASE BE CAREFUL TAKING THIS DRUG, ask plenty of questions and get started on a small dose, if anything seems off please tell your doctor immediately.",Rebecca24
3,Risperdal,Asperger Syndrome,4,,"September 26, 2014",54,"I was put on this medication as I have suffered from Aspergers Syndrome since I was diagnosed at four years old. This is powerful. At 5mg I felt like a Zombie. I was constantly sleeping because it the effects were strong. It gave me symptoms of Paranoia, for example, I was convinced all the time that I was going to throw up every time I ate. It put me off eating heavy food and as a result I lost weight. Probably one of the worst Anti-Psychotics I have ever taken. Too strong for a 15 year old (at the time) and when I came off it, It gave me Psychotic symptoms. I heard a constant moaning voice for days and it scared the crap out of me. Glad I'm of this medication!",Whatbloodyname
4,Risperdal,Asperger Syndrome,10,,"February 17, 2011",163,Our son has ADHD and Aspergers and often lost his temper and was irritable. We started him on 0.25mg of Risperdal each morning for 2 weeks and he is happy and sleeps better. To see him smiling and happy is worth it.,Anonymous
