0,Lisdexamfetamine,Asperger Syndrome,10.0,,"August 1, 2021",5,"Been on Elvanse 30mg for 3 months after having adult ADHD added as a diagnosis. It's the only drug based treatment that's worked and not caused issues like forgetting my dose or putting it off. By ""worked"" I mean it reduces the negatives of ASD/ADHD comorbidity, without any desire to misuse this or any other drug! It's given me a total aversion to cannabis which I used to self medicate with, as for drink it reduces my intake a lot as I can keep count of each pint (or half). My oppositional defiance has reduced from outright awful anti-social behaviour to minor naughtiness which I can work on. I eat less sugary snacks and fast food is once in a blue moon! Finally (and this is the best part) I am easier to get along with, and my family is no longer afraid of me! It's not often I agree with big pharma, but since its prodrug form requires patience and can't be thwarted/abused by crushing, chewing or other stupid means of misuse, thank you Shire and Thank You NHS!!!",Speedy Squirrel

4,Lisdexamfetamine,Asperger Syndrome,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 18, 2016",10,"Well I've been on many medications throughout my life  for asperger syndrine and ADHD and this particular one has been the most effective, I'd say Vyvanse and Strattera are the best medications for treating ADHD symptoms. So give Vyvanse a shot! Be patient with it too. It takes time finding the right medication. I also have low dopamine and the main thing that Vyvanse does is it increases the amount of neurotransmitters in the brain such as dopamine and norepinephrine, so that is a huge plus for me.",Kars15

He is able to focus much more easier.I also have an 18 yo daughter without Asperger Syndrome that takes it for A.D.D.  She tells me she noticed the difference in her ability to focus in about 3 doses.  She is starting her second year of Fashion School and she is maintaining a B  average for all 5 of her classes.Wonderful medication without any harmful side effects.  Wish we had it sooner.",MaggieV
