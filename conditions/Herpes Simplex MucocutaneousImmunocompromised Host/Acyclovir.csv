When she takes this medicine for the treatment of her HSV (oral), her chronic HSV is less severe, and although new ones do form, they fade away very quickly and at some points, her face is clear. She has taken it for as long as 5 weeks at a time and will begin taking prophylactic doses of this medication (long term) by next month. We (my husband and myself) believe that her initial outbreak of HSV was caused by the Varicella vaccine. Later blood tests revealed her immunodeficiency.",Brand2008
