0,Valtrex,Herpes Simplex MucocutaneousImmunocompromised Host,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 17, 2017",18,"I caught genital herpes from my Ex wife in 2015, she never told me about the virus. I had it for 2 years with so many outbreaks, and it affected my life.. People think herpes is really a minor skin irritation  but herpes has a long term effects on health. The stigma attached to this virus by ignorant people is ridiculous. Most people have herpes in one form or another, I was first taking Antiviral medicines, such as acyclovir(Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Valtrex), are recommended for treating primary genital herpes outbreaks. This medicine can be taken when an outbreak occurs. It can also be taken every day to help prevent outbreaks, it is not a total cure but sure helps",alexandersam
1,Valtrex,Herpes Simplex MucocutaneousImmunocompromised Host,10.0,,"November 11, 2013",47,"I was infected with HSV 2 about two weeks ago in the genital area, pubic area to be exact.  Only took 2 days before typical symptoms showed but I waited 4 days before going to the ER  thinking the OB was folliculitis.  I was prescribed Valtrex 1gm 2xs a day for ten days. After 2.5 days I noticed that the herpes stopped spreading and the pain was gone. After 5 days it was already healing/drying up. After 10 days it is almost completely healed/few scabs left. This drug is very effective but you have to take it on time every 12 hours or as instructed by your Dr. Side effects were fatigue, dry skin, dry eyes/ slight redness at times, mood swings, hives, and sleeplessness.",NoRainbow
2,Valtrex,Herpes Simplex MucocutaneousImmunocompromised Host,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 31, 2013",18,It's well worth it to ask your doctor to prescribe 1gm daily Valtrex for recurring cold sores.  You can easily take from your daily prescribed to help immediately when you notice a cold sore start by then taking 1gm 3 times in 24 hours.  The prescription for 3 pills costs the same as 30 days so I recommend to talk to your doctor.,redheadartiste
3,Valtrex,Herpes Simplex MucocutaneousImmunocompromised Host,10.0,,"October 2, 2010",45,"I am on a regimen program of Valtrex and I take 4 tablets on the onset of fever blister of the lips then 4 tablets 12 hours later.  Then, My Doctor prescribed 1 Valtrex daily forever.  It's well worth it.  I have not had any break outs since my Doctor put me on this prevention program.  I highly recommend Valtrex and am well satisfied with the results.  ",lindawalker
