0,Propranolol,Portal Hypertension,10,,"August 22, 2015",15,"I was prescribed this medication for portal hypertension related to liver disease, which resulted in esophageal varices.  I also happen to have primary hypertension, albeit not too bad (high-normal to Hypertension stage 1).  I discussed with my liver doctor the fact that my overall BP was rising again, and I had stopped taking Losartan.  He then decided to prescribe this drug instead, saying it would also help with the varices.  I also tend to be anxious, get migraines, and have insomnia.  This drug addresses everything with no bad side-effects and appears to be liver-friendly.  As a sleep aid, for me it ""takes the edge off"" of my anxiety, allowing me to sleep, and my migraines are under control.",Portal Hypertension
