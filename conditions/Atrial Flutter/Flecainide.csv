3,Flecainide,Atrial Flutter,1,,"November 27, 2017",16,"I started taking Flecainide Acetate , it  was prescribed for two 100 mg tablets  twice a day.  I took one the first day and no ill affects. Took the second one the next day and during the night had a bad attack of diarrhea for over twenty minutes  in the bathroom. After that it hit again about two hours later the same thing.  I won't do into details about what happen then, but I had a bad problem with it. I never had anything like that in my entire life. will talk to the doctor tomorrow about it , or his nurse. Last time I had a bad reaction from a medicine I told the doctor and she said ( it might of been a virus)  I had viruses all my life including the flu, and none every acted like this one did.",Joe Won

9,Flecainide,Atrial Flutter,10,,"September 27, 2011",55,"This medicine has been great for me.  I was first prescribed a beta-blocker when diagnosed.  However, it made me so sick and sluggish that my doctor switched me to Flecainide.  He warned me not to read about it on the internet because of all the warnings, but I knew I had to do something.  I have been on this medicine for 8 years with no problems (50 mg 2x day).  It has made a big positive difference for me.  I had a headache for about 3 days when I first started, but not since.  No other side effects at this dosage.",Anonymous
