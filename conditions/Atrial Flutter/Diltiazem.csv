0,Diltiazem,Atrial Flutter,3,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"May 20, 2021",4,"I've been on a low dose of diltiazem for about 5 years and it was working, then I recently had some vasospasms and they upped my dose twice. When I got up to 240 mg I started having stomach issues, lack of appetite, and worst of all unbearable depression. I've always dealt with anxiety but deep unbearable depression is not something I've ever had and I couldn't function. I hope this helps others when working with training the right meds.",LadyCrow616
1,Diltiazem,Atrial Flutter,7,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 18, 2020",40,"I had my heart go out of rhythm, wound up in the hospital overnight. So, my heart doctor increased my Diltiazem to 180 mg.  I had unusual tiredness, joint pain, labored breathing, depressed and couldn't function until 3 pm.Went back to the doctor and he insisted on me having a pet scan.  I did but I told him it was the medicine. I went back myself to the 120mg. and am doing well.  People know their own body. Doctors should believe patients.My son is a pharmacist and he said I was right.",Finney

4,Diltiazem,Atrial Flutter,1,,"April 24, 2017",25,"After my heart began racing several times with a pulse of 180 my doctor put me on Diltiazem (135).  However, after a couple of months my heart began racing again, so the doctor upped the Diltiazem to 180. I had been experiencing breathing problems and thought it was related to my asthma flaring and a wet winter. Now with the increased Diltiazem I am having even greater difficulty breathing with pretty severe shortness of breath. I think it is most likely related to the drug. Now seeking medical follow up.",Susan Y
5,Diltiazem,Atrial Flutter,9,,"December 3, 2016",27,"Diltiazem was started due to difficulty tolerating flushing of neck, chest and groin with Amylodipine. It has been effective at controlling palpitations but this improvement was not noted immediately after starting medication. It seemed to take over a week after switching from Amylodipine to Diltiazem before relief from palpitations were noted. Please note! If you take thyroid hormone replacement, be aware to avoid taking Diltiazem at same time as thyroid medicine.  My thyroid labs (TSH) have been steadily increasing over last 6 months (revealing that my dose of Synthroid has not been adequate) until it was discovered this week that this unwanted change in thyroid labs has been caused by taking Diltiazem daily at same time as Synthroid.",Julianab
6,Diltiazem,Atrial Flutter,1,,"October 4, 2016",68,"Cartia XT (diltiazem):I had a terrible reaction to Cartia XT's formulation of Cardizem, when my usual manufacturer, PAR who also makes Cardizem capsules, was not in stock at my pharmacy.So they substituted Cartia XT's formulation of Cardizem; I began having extreme racing, more than usual AF, and it continued to recur within about an hour after taking it each day.  It was very alarming, because PAR manufacturer of Cardizem never gave me a bad reaction and I had been taking it for years.Pharmacists who try to tell you that all generics are the same but that is misleading.  the main ingredient prescription drug must be the same as the brand; but the manufacturer can vary the remaining ingredients; and it is very difficult to find out what they are.",Jo Jose
7,Diltiazem,Atrial Flutter,10,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 22, 2016",19,"Cardizem (diltiazem):after Beta Blockers failed to work, and made me gain 20 lbs in 90 days. Dr then tried Verapamil , While that did work better not 100%.  After a 6 months , Then became allergic to it. Rare side effect.  Then Dr put me  on Cartia XT, after a day or 2 , I felt alot better.  Cartia XT is really is controlling my PVCs from Left Vertical, 8 months going now and no side effects yet. Works better than Verapamil for me.","""Paul"""
8,Diltiazem,Atrial Flutter,3,,"November 10, 2011",42,Cardizem CD (diltiazem):I have been diagnosed for 3 years with tachycardia and the doctor does not know why I have such a high heart rate. Was put on this medicine. Still at rest my heart rate is over 100. Yesterday he upped the dosage from 180 to 240mg. I'm so tired of having this problem and taking this medicine. ,BlondeNurse
9,Diltiazem,Atrial Flutter,3,,"December 30, 2010",29,"My cardiologist started me on this medicine, 60 mg 2 x a day. Everytime I took a dosage, I ended up with a severe pain across my back. When I stopped taking the medication, within 24 hours the pain went away. It reminded me of the same kind of pain one gets with a kidney infection.  So I quit taking the medicine.",Grandbabies6
