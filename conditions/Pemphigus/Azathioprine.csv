0,Azathioprine,Pemphigus,7,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 22, 2020",3,"I am a 38 year old female who was diagnosed with mouth, throat and esophageal pemphigus vulgaris in November 2018. I was given prednisone almost immediately, and two shots of rituximab in January 2019. In January 2019 I was started on azathioprine on a dose of 150mg. I was doing very well till November 2019 ... as from November I’ve been getting these weird chills especially in my back. Went to the ER twice- blood tests were run and on both occasions I was told the only problems is a high count of WBC in my urine - I don’t believe that is the cause of my chills. All I know is that they are driving me nuts. Can anyone relate?",NC
