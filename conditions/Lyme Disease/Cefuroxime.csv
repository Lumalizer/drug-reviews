0,Cefuroxime,Lyme Disease,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 8, 2020",3,I was prescribed this cefuroxime at a dose of 500mg 2 x a day for 10 days for Lyme Disease. I had no symptoms of having Lyme other than a bite mark and huge circular rash that was terribly itchy.  I have  had no side effects from cefuroxime for me. I will ask for this in the future. Best of luck to all who are ill. I hope you have a speedy recovery & are paired with a successful remedy!,Alice
1,Cefuroxime,Lyme Disease,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 12, 2019",14,"Got biten by a tick and doctor decided to put me on antibiotics to prevent lyme disease - even though there were no clear signs of lyme disease. Doctor prescribed this drug cefuroxime after only three pills of Doxycycline. Compared to the Doxycycline, this drug barely shows any side effects at all! First thing I noticed was a weird taste in my mouth a couple of minutes after swallowing my first pill (probably because it's bitter). Also been having a bit of lightheadedness and a bit less appetite. Oral thrush barely noticeable. But compared to the Doxycycline I absolutely recommend this antibiotic. Doesn't burn your stomach/esophagus, doesn't cause sun sensitivity, doesn't ruin your sense of taste and smell etc like the doxycycline did. I was able to take 500mg of this drug twice a day for three weeks. I gave up on Doxycycline just after the third pill since the side effects were DEVASTATING. Cefuroxime is a great antibiotic!",Johnny Doe Jr

3,Cefuroxime,Lyme Disease,5,,"July 11, 2016",4,"Ceftin (cefuroxime):son of 3,5 years old has Lyme; received cefuroxime axetil 250 mg oral suspension  21 days. It was hard to find pharmacy that carries this. The pediatrician had to mediate. Our son did a great job taking the medicine, as we used a plastic, injection tof administer it to him. He did fine with that. However. On the bottle it said to shake well before use. The liquid was too thick for shaking. You had to just wait for the goo to come out of the  narrow bottle. When the bottle was ""empty"" there was a thick layer at the bottom and around the sides. Even thicker than the rest. How can we tell if he got the right amount of medicine? Better to put susp into an open neck jar and stir each time. With Lyme you""re never sure if medication worked.",kindje
