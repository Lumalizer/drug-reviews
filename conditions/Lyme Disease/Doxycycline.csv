1,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease,7.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 19, 2021",1,"In 2017, I was first prescribed Doxycline 100mg, for an acute Lyme infection. I had a positive western blot.. I struggle with CRPS, Fibro, Spinal Stenosis, Scoliosis, Disc Herniations, Arthritis, and much more. It is very hard to decipher when I would have a Lyme flare but picked up on it this year. If I take 2 Doxycycline I feel a lot better, just once a day doesn't do much. I cannot take the IV med they offered me at the hospital as I'm allergic. Lyme is a life long sentence if you do not have an obvious tick bite. Please do you due diligence and esp. keep kids safe !",Carol B.

3,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 9, 2021",2,"My dad and I got put on this medicine because we both got bit by a tic and started getting a bulls eye rash. We both were on the medicine for less then 2 weeks. We both got even more sick by being on the medication, we couldn’t even get out of bed. My dad started having personality changes. He was very confused on where he was at and what he was doing. This medication causes people to have really bad anxiety, depressing, and suicidal thoughts. My dad ended up ending his life while on this medication. Before the medication he was always happy, jokes around with everyone, loved hanging out with his friends and family. He had no history of having anxiety or depression in the past. I do blame doxycycline 100% and I do not recommend this at all. And if you do decide to take it, make sure you have someone watch if you and you talk to someone.",Aub

5,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease,7.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 18, 2021",9,"I was bit on lower leg Thursday and noticed quarter size red rash that was warm, hard, dizziness and pain up my leg. Took ibuprofen/Benadryl and went to bed. Friday AM, rash was more red with 2 clear puncture marks. Called my telehealth and got antibiotic for spider bite. Friday PM, bite was worse. Puncture marks/rash both bigger. Saturday AM, went to urgent care and doctor said it was Lyme. Rash was a bullseye, hard, swollen, and 6x5. Doctor prescribed 100mg of doxycycline 2x/day for 5 days. Drank water/took without food for first 4 days without issues. By 5th day, had fever/threw up (not sure if Lyme or Doxy related). By PM, lost vision, eye pressure, headache, and chest pain. Let PCP know and stopped due to severe side effects. Started amoxicillin. I feel doxy can be great to stop Lyme (noticed rash decreased with bruising within 4 days) but side effects weren’t worth it. Developed secondary rashes on legs/hips, not sure if due to Lyme or doxy.",KK
6,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease,9.0,,"December 9, 2020",31,I’m 22 and in mid-August I started feeling fatigued & lightheaded out of nowhere. It lasted for days & just wasn’t getting any better. I’d feel it from the second I woke up to when I went back to sleep at night. Just felt overall drained and sort of a brain-fog. I had been hiking a lot in the summer too due to COVID. After telling my Mom (who has Lyme disease) my symptoms she suggested getting regular bloodwork done but also a blood test for Lymes. Thank goodness she suggested that Lymes test because otherwise I wouldn’t have known I had it and it’s key to catch Lymes early. Tested positive for a recent infection & got put on Doxycycline- 2  pills a day for 3 weeks. It took time but very slowly I started to feel better. Now it’s been 3 months since I took Doxi and I don’t really have those daily symptoms of fatigue and lightheadedness anymore. I recommend eating a granola bar when taking in the morning because it did make me feel sick on an empty stomach.,Lyme Disease Sucks

The first time was 21 days for Lyme Disease and Shingles at the same time, things were ok, just a little dizzy.  After being off it a week, the 2nd time was 7 days for a Cellulitis Infection, I felt queasy and dizzy with it that time. Third time was about a week later after a small hand surgery  After 1 1/2 days I was so sick,  I had nausea, dizziness, and vomiting.  I threw the doxy away. I believe my body was done with taking so much of it in a close time frame.",Tired of Doxy
8,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease,8.0,,"September 26, 2020",7,"Wanted to share my experience as I was really nervous to take doxycycline for Lyme disease due to the bad experiences mentioned all over the internet (and I have a fear of being sick). It was completely fine!I took 1 pill twice a day for 21 days, and always made sure to take them with food (avoid dairy as it affects absorption). It was completely fine! For a couple of days near the start there was some *slight* nausea, then nothing at all for about two weeks, then some nausea again at the end. I wasn’t sick, and I didn’t have headaches or any of the other symptoms mentioned here.Most importantly, they cleared up my horrible Lyme rash and hopefully mean that the illness won’t affect me in future. If you’ve been prescribed these for a similar reason DEFINITELY take them, plenty of people have few or no side affects and Lyme is something you do not want to mess with!Note: my dr also prescribed me pantoprazole to take once a day, to protect my stomach. I only did this for the first week",emsy
9,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 26, 2020",16,"I initially thought I had COVID-19 early June when I developed a fever and strong chills. That resolved after a few days. I got diagnosed with Lyme Disease a month later after I developed bell’s palsy and got tested for Lyme. I took doxycycline for 21 days. The facial palsy completely disappeared after 2 weeks. The only side effect I experienced from doxy was nausea. On the last day, my whole body was achy. After a few days, it went away. I still had some days of feeling achy. It’s getting better day by day. I’m feeling way better than before and almost back to normal. However, I think doxy gave me stomach problems or maybe it’s the anxiety from everything that has happened. Who knows. Overall, I’d say it did work and I feel back normal whereas before I felt like it would slowly be the end of my life",ihateticks

11,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 27, 2020",2,Avoid doxycycline like the plague!  I was prescribed this drug as a precaution after being bitten by a tick which left an increasingly red ring surrounding the bite.  After the first 3 doses my upper body and face were covered in an intensely itchy bright red rash.  I was not out in the sun while taking this like many people who have a reaction to it.  I have had a sun allergy since the 1990's and my body may have been a lot more sensitive to this drugs side effects.  I started the drug on Thursday  and only took one on Friday before calling my doctor.  My prescription has been changed but I am suffering terribly from this still late Sunday night.  Back to the doctor again tomorrow to see if I can put an end to this ungodly torturous rash.,Cj

I have taken 2 rounds of doxycycline and still testing positive for it. I have now gotten to where all I want to do is sleep and my whole body hurts and is so weak that I literally cannot stand sometimes. I don't know what they will do next but already have diabetes and heart problems so I hope they figure something out soon. For anyone who thinks it is no big deal,  this is completely different than just being tired, its almost like being paralyzed.

15,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease,10.0,,"September 6, 2019",68,"I woke up 4 weeks ago with a red blotchy rash and immediately went to see my doctor. I was diagnosed with Lyme and started taking doxycycline prescribed for 21 days. I had the symptoms of extreme fatigue and what I thought were flu symptoms. I did the research on the doxy before I took it, I am not a fan of taking any medication. I read that it should be taken with a lot of water. I would drink 8 ounces of water before the pill and the same after and the only time I got sick was when I drank less than 8 ounces, it was an awful experience.  I am on my last day of the meds, In my opinion, drinking almost 40 ounces of water a day has helped this process. It prevents you from getting sick and it flushes the toxins out of your body, your stomach will reward you and you are helping your body detox.  I am excited as today is my last day on doxy and looking forward to positive lab results in a few weeks. Wishing everyone that reads this a healthy and complete recovery!",Countrygirl
16,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 17, 2019",22,"I can’t give it a 10 because it’s not a cure. I believe Mytomycin-C is the cure and I have no way to get my hands on it. Doxy 400mg every 12hr for several months gets a 9 star from me because it saved my life and put me out of my pure misery that I endured for 10 years. Whenever I take it, my trigaminal nerve in my face (right side) heats up and the other joints that are always in pain heat up. But  after 10 months I’m at the gym instead of on my death bed. Ps. Have alternated with penicillin for a month and minocycline for a month, then had also have included metronidazole the first month to prevent diarrhea. Can’t stop the doxy or mino though or symptoms return within a few weeks. That could indicate bartonella infection as well sadly. I’ve rescued my share of stray sick cats and groomed my share of tick infested dogs, yuck. Not a pet a person anymore!

But a day later I notice a red rash, and realized having taken outdoor first aid courses that it was a tick bite and a possible infection. No symptoms of Lyme disease but I wen to my doctor anyway. He prescribed 14 days of the same antibiotic. I had no side effects and the rash is almost gone. I believe in prevention and precautionary treatment rather than be sorry later.",Hiker1
19,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease,9.0,,"June 17, 2019",36,"I had two tick bites on my hip by my belt line. Then not a couple weeks later I got bit again on my left arm. About 3 weeks later I developed almost out of nowhere extreme joint pain and stiffness, complete loss of energy, headache, a very stiff neck, and sensitivity to light. I went to doctor about two days into this. They did blood work for Lyme disease and it came back negative. Symptoms persisted terribly. Doctor did a different panel which came back negative but the doctor due to my symptoms got me on this antibiotic. The first three days were the worst I've ever felt body wise in my life. The doctor did instruct me that that would happen during the bacterial die off (Herxheimer reaction). By day 5 all symptoms but the extreme fatigue faded. I did experience weird light aberrations. The continued extreme fatigue is the only real problem now. Doctor did mention that the treatment can take 14 days up to a month before you are 100%.",Fritz

A couple of week later I was having weird and random joint pain.  Like the tip of my left ring finger was painful, foot and leg pain, sheer exhaustion. Then it hit me, I had similar symptoms in 2002 when I tested positive for Lyme. My doctor  prescribed me  100 mg doxycycline twice daily based on symptoms.  I am finishing my second week of three.

Days 2-5 of taking it, you could look up the symptoms of what’s called a die-off of lyme bacteria from what I found, and every single one of them was felt: Chills, weakness, muscle and bone aches, you name it. It was horrible. Never felt like that in my life. But I finished the doxy and now I’ve been fine ever since. Even if you don’t think you have it, go get some antibiotics.

24,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease,7.0,,"June 19, 2018",53,"I am a 55 year old woman and was prescribed Doxycycline Hyclate 100mg for Lyme Disease. I took it twice a day for 30 days. During the last week of treatment, I noticed how I started to feel depressed: I found everything and everyone to be irritating, and I just wanted to be left alone. Yesterday was my first day without the medication, and I spent the most awful night of my life: I experienced vivid suicidal thoughts, was contemplating ways to end my life, and even wrote a letter to my children. The next day, I browsed the Internet and noticed I was not alone! I feel the company should absolutely list suicidal thoughts as a side effect of their drug, not only for adolescents, but for adults also. This way, family members and doctors could be warned and keep a close eye on every person to whom this drug is prescribed.

25,Doxycycline,Lyme Disease,10.0,,"May 18, 2018",20,"I took doxycycline for 20 days when I had a positive Western Lyme blot test. I also had another active positive test six months later, but the CDC only recommends initial treatment. I've taken this med for many things because I am allergic to all drugs except Cephalosporins and tetracyclines. I saw a lot of bad reviews and just wanted to say I take this drug with absolutely NO side effects  (just be careful about sunlight and drinking milk with it as per instructions) but I have taken it wonderfully and so has everyone in my family. I also have never met anyone who has had a problem with it. That's not to say everyone's not different -- I'm allergic to a zillion meds! -- but I wanted to assure that I don't believe the majority of people will have a problem with this med so don't be afraid to try it.

I thought is was an acne pimple or mosquito bite. Started to feel fatigue, pain up and down my spine, brain fog, headache, night sweats. I thought it could be the flu, lucky for me a big red rash showed up 2 days later, so I went to my primary doctor. He tested me for lymes and it was positive. The worst system for me was the pain up and down my spine especially at night and before I woke up, the heavy nights sweats were worrying also. I have read tons of articles on Lymes and hope this can help others. I am in my 50s and in pretty good health, not over weight and exercise 1 to 2 days per week. I have never had any other health issues. The doctor prescribed doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 30 days. Started to feel normal 2-3 days after started taking. I had no major side effects. After and during the 30 days I felt that I had killed the disease. Two months later out of nowhere my spine started to hurt again and night sweats etc came back. I waited 4 or 5 days to see if it was going to go away, but no suck luck. Went back to primary doctor, he thought I should try amoxicillin 500 mg orally three times daily for 21 days. Started taking it but the results were very different then Doxycycline. The whole 21 days plus 5 more days after I stopped having pain in my spine and no more night sweats, but my whole body felt like it was trying to fight off something and my arms felt like they had mild pins and needles in them for the full 26 days. I thought maybe that meant it was working, so I suffered through. After the 26 days I still wasn't feeling right , major bad symptoms were gone but still had brain fog and fatigue. Went to Infectious Disease/ Lyme Dr. told my story asked a lot of questions. He recommended I go back on Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 60 days and that should be it. I started taking it again November 6th all problem systems are gone and I'm feeling normal again. I also truly believe that exercise with machines or weights and 30 minutes or aerobics along with steam or sauna help a lot, heavy blood circulations gets you immune system to work better and gets the toxins out in my opinion. Lets hope I don't get the lyme systems back again after the 60 days. Good luck to all who come down with this terrible disease.",mystory1234

Exercise consistently (within your limits). This has really improved heart and cognition problems for me. They do get better it just takes time. Be patient... Taking doxy after 4 weeks for Lyme is not necessary unless you have serious neuro complications .
