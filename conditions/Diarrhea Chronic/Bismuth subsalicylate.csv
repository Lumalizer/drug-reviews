0,Bismuth subsalicylate,Diarrhea Chronic,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 7, 2020",8,"Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate):Let me tell you, Pepto Bismol is the best medicine I have ever taken for my stomach issues, I have IBS-C and sometimes my IBS medicine gives me nasty side effects, and makes me bloat, have indigestion, stomach pain and pepto bismol will literally get rid of all my symptoms. I absolutely love it! It has given me back my life seriously, I do not take my IBS medicine everyday whenever I need it, and then the side effects come and I will take pepto bismol and I feel actually normal! I forgot what normal felt like until I took this medicine! I always recommend it  to my friends and family. I call pepto bismol gold in a bottle. Also I appreciate not having crazy side effects from this medicine, it just helps me and no problems. I only take it when I take my IBS medicine and it doesn't stop my IBS medicine from working either! This is great stuff",Sasha3522
