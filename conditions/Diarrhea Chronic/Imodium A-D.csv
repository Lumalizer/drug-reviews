0,Imodium A-D,Diarrhea Chronic,1,,"May 13, 2020",18,"I have crohns and so have chronic diarrhea I used to be able to afford this med. Now, it is impossible. As for packaging... it is always important to make the product so hard to get out of the packaging I end up tossing it anyway because so many pills have been damaged just trying to get them out of the packaging. So, I spend 20 minutes cutting them out and putting them into an old bottle to make them easier to access. So tired of being treated like crud because I need the meds others abuse. On top of that I can't buy online anymore. I am not able to get out most days due to my condition. I used to be able to have it sent to the house, now even that is impossible.",nt77

2,Imodium A-D,Diarrhea Chronic,10,,"March 14, 2015",29,I have used this over the counter medication for many years. I have IBS and I find this Imodium A-D works to stop my diarrhea. It might be a good idea to take it with you where ever you go for emergencies. If you have IBS you should talk with your doctor about diet.,I've used it for years.
