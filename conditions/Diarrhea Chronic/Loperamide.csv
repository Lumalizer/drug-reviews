0,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 23, 2021",0,A-D Anti-Diarrheal (loperamide):I've been struggling with have chronic diarrhea for awhile now and got fed up with it. It's only awful in the mornings where I'd have to go to the bathroom 5+ times. With my morning classes and then student teaching I was so scared that I would have an accident. I started taking these (2 pills) the night before I have to get up early and haven't had a problem since!,Cake4ever
1,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 17, 2021",1,Imodium (loperamide):Have been taking Imodium daily for several years and I am grateful it exists. Without it I could not function as my IBS can interfere with daily routines - like driving to work. I learnt only this year was how important it to stay well hydrated while on this drug. It is critical to drink lots! I often take extra care on hot days by taking something to keep the electrolytes up - (e.g. Hydrolyte).,Always learning
2,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,7,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 6, 2021",26,"Imodium (loperamide):Worst packaging EVER!!!! Who would design packaging that requires scissors to access EACH PILL!!!??? Every time, which is often, I need to take the pills I end up frustrated with bleeding fingers! Why can't someone design a small bottle with pills inside it like most meds??? And do NOT suggest I drink the disgusting liquid.Very frustrated user!",Bella
3,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 22, 2021",7,"I've suffered from diarrhea most of my life, but it became worse after having my non-functioning gall bladder removed.  I had several accidents at work, driving to work, etc.  I changed my route to work to ensure that I knew where all the bathrooms were. My gastro at the time said the diarrhea was not related to the surgery.   Switching to another gastro saved my life.  He diagnosed me with Bile salt Mal-absorption syndrome, which occurs in many postcholecystectomy patients.   He ordered Welchol to help regulate the excess bile and recommend Immodium.    I now take 2 Welchol a day in the morning and then follow with 2 Immodium tablets.   Then around noon, take 2 calcium Carbonate tablets.  This combination has given me my life back.   No diarrhea and fewer problems with mush poo.  It took a while to figure out the best time and combination for me.",Greyeyes
4,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,8,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 5, 2021",2,I have IBS (both D & C). Lately mostly D. I've tried a few different medications and they wind up causing the constipation. Tonight I started  Loperamide 2 mg capsules (prescription strength). I took the 2 that you're supposed to take first dose. So far it's been about 3 hours and I'm okay I think. I have a little stomach ache but not like cramping. Hopefully that's it for the D and this medication will be good for me.,Karly
5,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 13, 2020",45,"Imodium (loperamide):This medication has worked great for my ibs-d. I’ve had ibs-d for 15 years and nothing has helped me until I started taking 1 Imodium per day in the morning after first bm. I used to have to go to the bathroom 3-5 times every morning. Now I go once most days, sometimes twice. This drug works on the opioid receptors in the gut and causes gut motility to slow, it has really worked for me and has changed my life for the better. I actually have a life now and don’t have to worry about where the bathroom is all the time. Good luck everyone !",Ibs-d sufferer
6,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 2, 2020",23,"Imodium (loperamide):I tried Imodium after having prolonged chronic diarrhea over months as a result of anxiety. This cleared it up overnight with the use of 2 tablets. I have finally found relief using this product, highly recommend.",alcey
7,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,1,,"May 13, 2020",18,"Imodium A-D (loperamide):I have crohns and so have chronic diarrhea I used to be able to afford this med. Now, it is impossible. As for packaging... it is always important to make the product so hard to get out of the packaging I end up tossing it anyway because so many pills have been damaged just trying to get them out of the packaging. So, I spend 20 minutes cutting them out and putting them into an old bottle to make them easier to access. So tired of being treated like crud because I need the meds others abuse. On top of that I can't buy online anymore. I am not able to get out most days due to my condition. I used to be able to have it sent to the house, now even that is impossible.",nt77
8,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 27, 2020",6,"I have had chronic diarrhea for over ten years, reasonably controlled by two 2mg tablets. Have tried many things to control it- different meds (forget what, but they did not work).  Tried probiotics but they made it worse.  Took myself off loperamide- nothing happened for 8  days, then it came back big-time.  Sought medical help.  I have a wonderful doctor but this seems to be the kind of thing that one has to mostly work out by oneself.  Am reading the book ""The Happy Gut"".  Helping but it's hard to implement their approach entirely.  Have learned that breads with white flower are a problem.  Scrambled eggs, unless cooked quite hard, are bad.  Oranges, which I love, are not good.  Lithuanian rye bread is good.  Still learning.Have resisted upping the dose to three/day but will also try that next.",Capn John
9,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,10,,"August 8, 2019",43,"Imodium (loperamide):Me and my sister both have on going diarrhea. Every. Single. Day. 1-2 times a day for me but more for her. All females in our family have it. It’s our family curse. But we took 2 of these pills for only TWO days and we didn’t have any intestinal activity for the next FIVE days. From taking TWO tablets for TWO days (so we took ONLY 4 mg each day, once a day, for only two days) So we took that tiny, small amount and didn’t have even a slight cramp, not even a bubble in our intestine, nothing. for five days. This never ever happens and we both were somewhat constipated still even on day 5. Idk how anyone is saying it didn’t work. It definitely worked for us at least.",Eleane

11,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,8,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 16, 2019",14,"I have Crohn's disease, and I take loperamide during flares so I don't have to be on the toilet all the time. It doesn't get rid of the other stuff like cramps, nausea, weight loss, or fatigue, but it does something for my diarrhea. It made my flares easier to manage at school and work, as I don't have to be racing to the bathroom all the time, then having to leave early as a result of my sickness. However, I had to rate it less than a 10 as it doesn't always work. The problem is I have malabsorption due to small intestinal inflammation, so sometimes the medicine might not work. Roughage will make it not work either. So, I can't just eat whatever I want while taking this. I still have to eat a bland low-roughage/residue diet.",siswollan
12,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 4, 2018",32,"Imodium (loperamide):I have IBS and had a bad flare up. 4 weeks of tests and constant diarrhea, they finally confirmed there was no infection so allowed me to take Immodium. I chose the plus comfort as I also have stomach pains. Followed instructions and took 2, I don't mean to be crude,  but I am elated to say that the next day I managed a normal BM for the first time in a month! Not noticed any help with the stomach pains/bloating but has definitely helped the flare up!",Oblong
13,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,7,,"January 15, 2018",18,Imodium (loperamide):I felt better about 3 hours after taking 2 tablets. Still have a slight problem though but will be taking one more twice a day and I expect to feel much better then.,John W the Brit
14,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,10,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 9, 2017",14,"I have IBS but no health insurance and can't afford expensive treatments and prescription medications. My wonderful doctor recommended a ""maintenance"" regimen of 2 loperamide daily to control the chronic diarrhea that was greatly affecting my life. Between this and watching my diet, sticking mainly to non-dairy, sugar free and gluten free foods, I've been able to live a mostly normal life with very few flare ups. I highly recommend.",LM921
15,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 7, 2017",65,"Imodium (loperamide):I have IBS plus I'm lactose intolerant and have struggled with this for 5 years now so far and for 3 years I was unable to enjoy a meal because as soon as I ate, I was in the bathroom. When I take imodium now for the past 2 years, I can actually eat meals and it wont bother my stomach. I feel normal and go to the bathroom normally but if I miss a day and don't take the pills, I am back to going to the bathroom after every meal. Imodium has really helped me. Especially when it triggers in the morning, so it helps me to be able to go to work at 5am. There are somedays I didn't have pills and could not go into work because I could not stop using the bathroom. I love imodium!",Nessaa

20,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,10,,"March 14, 2015",29,Imodium A-D (loperamide):I have used this over the counter medication for many years. I have IBS and I find this Imodium A-D works to stop my diarrhea. It might be a good idea to take it with you where ever you go for emergencies. If you have IBS you should talk with your doctor about diet.,I've used it for years.
21,Loperamide,Diarrhea Chronic,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 12, 2012",189,"Imodium (loperamide):I have had chronic diarrhea for 20 years. I could not eat without experiencing diarrhea, had accidents in public places. The first thing I did when entering a new building was locate the restroom. I frequently had to leave my classroom unattended to run--no running would have been disastrous--carefully walk to the nearest restroom and have embarrassingly flatulent and explosive bouts of diarrhea. I finally started  self-medicating, taking one tablet in the morning and one before supper. I have two normal bowel motions a day. No more diarrhea now. My life has changed!",So relieved!
