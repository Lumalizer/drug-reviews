Then tried doubling the dose to see if that would do the trick. Still NOTHING. I did however feel weird, loopy, not normal, and after reading other people's accounts of Tramadol working like an SSRI or antidepressant , I can tell you that it's not something I'll be taking any more.

6,Tramadol,Chronic Pain,5.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 21, 2021",1,"Tramadol worked great for my mother.  She rarely complained about pain when it was prescribed.  However, it was completely useless for mine.  If you suffer from severe chronic pain I would suggest something else.  I never experienced any terrible side effects.  Its efficacy was lacking.  Your mileage may vary.  I suppose this works wonders for some and not at all for others, like a lot of medications.",Amenhir
7,Tramadol,Chronic Pain,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 21, 2021",0,"I was previously on oxycodone and Gabapentin for neuropathy, and they changed me to Tramadol and Gabapentin. It does just as good a job of controlling my chronic pain so that’s a positive. I take 50mg every 8 hours, and my Dr. gave me an extra 50mg dose to take as a rescue medication in case I experience a lot of nerve pain at night. Honestly I’m pretty stable these days pain-wise, so I’m counting my blessings. Tramadol does leave me a bit tired, but I don’t get a ‘high’ from it. No other side-effects to report so far, it’s been several months now. I can also take temazepam 15mg at night to sleep, which is great since I wasn’t allowed to take any benzos with the oxycodone. I’d say my quality of life is a bit better, I have less brain fog and apathy with the Tramadol. I’m also able to start exercising more; I take short walks and do yoga.",Missy1315

Well, I did go it alone, and went through every level of nightmares there is!!I then tried Tylenol with aspirin to combat the excruciating pain I was experiencing no good, and besides Tylenol is scary because of the kidney damage warnings, and the low dosages you must take, so it's pretty ineffective for the pain I was feeling!AND then during a hospital stay I was introduced to Tramadol and it was absolutely LIFE CHANGING, the immediate effect it had on me was not only (almost) 100% pain relieving but also mood enhancer.I have now been on Tramadol for a number of years...I take 2 Tramadol 3X a day, and I'm one, happy camper!",Tramadol user

I am 12 hours out from taking a 50 mg dose and have had such intense dizziness, nausea, headaches, ringing ears, and it’s caused me tremors and hypnotic jerks. I cannot sleep no matter how exhausted and desperate I am to, as I am woken up from scary jerks that haven’t gone away 12 hours later. Although it took away my chest pains and other body chronic pains, it’s caused just as much pain from not allowing me to sleep or function properly. I felt so out of it, I was trembling to walk and slurring my words during the day. Skip this opioid if you can unless you want to go through that.",pinkkitty

The Tramadol only has the side effect of a little nausea once in awhile. I am prescribed 50mg 3X day as needed. It helps me to move my stiff body through the day and feel less pain. It is not 100%, but gives relief. My mail-order drug company that sends my meds tried to have my prescription blocked, I had to also go into the doctors office each time to fill out a paper. My doctor intervened and now I am sent a 90 day supply through the mail-order pharmacy with only problems sometimes with them trying to block the prescription.

22,Tramadol,Chronic Pain,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 17, 2021",2,"Ultram (tramadol):I have been on Tramadol/Ultram for 13 years.  It works on my pain 80% of the time.  However when I added Tizanidine (a muscle relaxer - not to be taken with Tramadol at the same time), I have been mostly pain free.  I take Tizanidine at night for back pain.  It causes drowsiness so do not take during the day.  I take 100mg Tramadol 3x a day for nerve pain.  It works PERFECTLY for me.  Unfortunately I was forced to taper off and get off Tramadol to try Nortripyline which only worked 60% and made me so fatigued I was bed-bound.  Now I am tapering off Nortripyline and going to whatever plan B my neurologist has for me.  My honest opinion - Tramadol works for moderate pain - not severe pain.  I like it because it keeps me comfortable and does not have the loopy side effect of Hydrocodone.  I can function well at least until 5 or 6 p.m. before the nerve pain hits.  This to me is a win.",GettingOutOfHand
23,Tramadol,Chronic Pain,10.0,,"July 15, 2021",2,"I was prescribed tramadol for chronic pain, I have a large tarlov cyst with communicating spinal fluid in my lower spine, tramadol has given me hope and even when I don't take it, I know it is there, and that calms me. I've also noticed that it helps my constipation. I can go to the loo far more easily when I take it, even though it is supposed to cause constipation,  it has the opposite effect on me. I feel calmer and clear in my head when I take it on time. Sometimes if the pain overwhelms me and I can't walk or move very well, I know I should have taken tramadol earlier , then it's bed for hours or days. It's a fine line because the pain is too intense for tramadol to soften it.  I don't want to lose its benefits so I try to not take it sometimes. It is a balancing act. I am very grateful that my doctor prescribed tramadol for my pain, mainly because I can be less of a burden to my family and sometimes I can do things that I had given up because of pain. Hope is wonderful.",Sweet pea

26,Tramadol,Chronic Pain,6.0,,"April 17, 2021",4,"Tramadol-prescribed for pain/relieved my depression. For me personally,  I found that it worked best taken at low levels in the am/pm, but did sometimes  have an effect on sleep if taken at too high of a dose in pm. Once I was switched off of this medication, without being tapered, and onto something different for pain all together, is when I realized the positive, anti-depressant effect tramadol was having on me. It was not opioid-analgesic withdrawal that I was experiencing, to anyone who may be having that thought. I was switched to something else for the pain, but the depression persists to this day. The only time I ever feel relief from the depression is when I take some of the tramadol that I saved to ease the depression.",Former optimist
27,Tramadol,Chronic Pain,9.0,,"April 16, 2021",8,"Tramadol helps EVERYTHING. I have IBS, interstitial cystitis, stage 4 endometriosis, and a multitude of other health issues. It helps relieve my chronic bladder and pelvic pain. It slows down my gut and helps with IBS symptoms. It improves my mood, my sleep quality, and my feelings of depression. I have undergone several surgeries and procedures. Yes, there is an opioid crisis and yes people do abuse medications but people who suffer daily deserve to feel better and live more active and happy lives. I walk 4 miles every day and couldn’t do this without the help of Tramadol. It gave me a big chunk of my life back after being able to do near nothing. Yes yes yes. I am under the care of a pain management doc, submit to random urine tests, signed an agreement, an honest with my doctor, and keep the lines of communication open. I’m doing it the right way.

I spoke to my GP again and was told that I shouldn't double my dose and to drop back down, although I have only been on the doubled dose for 5 or 6 days I'm finding it really difficult, dropping one 50mg tablet every 4 days, I'm assuming the feeling really really bad will ease.......",Gazflinn

30,Tramadol,Chronic Pain,10.0,,"February 12, 2021",31,"Ultram (tramadol):Ultram has worked well for the multiple chronic pain issues I have and has allowed me to function though the cervical/lumber problems are becoming worse.  If not for Ultram, I would be housebound & unable to move.  Unfortunately, a new doctor without reason reduced the script which has resulted in my pain increasing and being unable to sometimes walk. I did further research and found the DEA final report that clearly states that doctors should not decrease or stop this med for chronic pain.  They were quick to prescribe gabapentin which is one of the worst drugs taken-within 36 hours I had a severe adverse event.  I filed an adverse event complaint with FDA and also had my pharmacy redline the drug so it would not be prescribed again.

Not sure if I'm some weird case, but I couldn't sleep for 4 days, had electricity in my arms and legs, severe lack of energy, it was unreal. A week of pure nightmare on earth. Don't be scared to take this medication, but just be aware that this medication is highly addictive, and has SNRI effects, so if you do not do well with SNRI medications, might be better to look elsewhere. The fact that Dr's prescribe these like they are candy is scary, and they do not even believe you when you say you had withdrawals. Thank goodness I'm off of this medication.",Av8er31
33,Tramadol,Chronic Pain,10.0,,"January 2, 2021",6,"Given Tramadol as a PRN for lumbar pain caused by bulging discs and osteoarthritis, sciatica. I also have fibro, myofacial pain in shoulders, severe reoccurring depression. First time I took 100mg I couldn't sleep but my pain was decreased so much I didn't care. I went thru a spell of bad sciatica pain, ended up taking one 100mg a day for 3 consecutive days. I thought I had imagined the increased energy and joy. I felt like myself and wanted to do things I used to do. The 2nd day I definitely felt the increased motivation and energy; NOT a hyper or overwhelming feeling. I was able to focus and concentrate more. It really does rid me of sciatica pain for most of the day and decreases the lumbar pain. In 2 weeks I'll ask my DR about her experience and knowledge to see if it can be incorporated into a daily regimen to assist some of the other medication.

I have a chronic condition which causes severe pain. I was taking as prescribed, and after a few weeks I would wake up every morning at 4am, feeling doomed. I knew everything was fine, yet I would cry and my heart would race, and my stomach would churn. This went on for almost a year. I eventually weaned myself off, but that took a solid six months of having to end up taking a sliver of a pill at a time. It was BRUTAL! I would never wish this on anyone!!!!

I take both SR & IR forms. Only side effect is that they keep me awake at night, so I don’t take them near bed time. I don’t experience any nausea, dizziness, etc like with other pain meds. I can stop these & don’t experience any withdrawal.To work, these are dependant on you having specific liver function to process the breakdown of active ingredients.I’m lucky that these work well for, but if you don’t have the right liver enzymes then these may not work at all for you or cause nasty side effects -as some have noted.

At first I was worried because of the risk of addiction but I have no problem with not taking it.  I stopped drinking alcohol completely because that brings on even worse headaches.

Take 1 tramadol and the pain goes away! Not to mention it puts me in a great mood- not like a ""high"" or euphoria but almost like what an antidepressant should do- or a mood enhancer. I don't find it addicting as it is extremely mild, but it definitely gets the job done. I've been on it for months and i'm so glad I asked my dr to switch me from Oxycodone to these. Tramadol also helps with my anxiety too! Only downside is that they give me headaches sometimes.",Chelseabergstresser

I also have moderate - severe back pain due to spondylothesis. I have had these problems for 5 to 10 years. I was taking oxycodone 15 mg every 4 to 6 hours and that managed my pain pretty well, reducing it from an 8/10 down to 0/10 to 3/10 depending on whether I took the medication before the pain got too intense.I was then switched to Tramadol 50 for a holiday from the opioid. The Tramadol did not provide ANY pain relief. I did experience the brain zaps that can be common with SNRI medication and that was after only 11 days (they become more frequent and intense with increased dose and period).

Am unable to tolerate NSAIDs.  I also have Norco (10/325 hyrocodone/acetamphine) as a back up.  I experience chronic low level pain which I deal with through exercise and acupuncture and use Tramadol if it worsens - so I do not take daily and have never experienced any withdrawal symptoms as some people have mentioned.  For what I use it for, it works fairly well and I have no side effects.  But the notion that it is not addictive is false and as of August 2014 has been re-classed as a Schedule IV. In terms of acute pain, I do not find it nearly as effective as Norco but I only need that 1x or 2x a month.",sijii

It is usually but not always effective.  I often have to add the NSAID Naprosyn.  I have neuropathy and other side effects from chemo and osteoarthritis also from chemo.  Many joints have no cartilage.  I am concerned about chemical dependency and consciously avoided codeine or morphine.  The Tramadol gets me through the average pain but not the severe pain.  I really wish someone would come up with an analgesic that was both effective and nonaddictive and did not diminish alertness and effectiveness.,weworkforamerica

It did not do much for severe low back pain but otherwise it works well and I would rather not be taking Vicodin. It does leave me with severe cotton mouth and possibly some dizziness (could be due to other issues though). I consider it inexpensive and relatively effective, I don't experience any kind of high from any of my pain medicines including Vicodin, so my experience may not be typical.

Luckily I don't suffer from too many side effects (except drowsiness) But 150mg is a strong dose, knocks me right out. some people also need antiemetics to tolerate them as they commonly cause nausea.
