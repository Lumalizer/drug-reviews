0,Oxycodone,Chronic Pain,8.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"April 1, 2022",0,"I have chronic pain due to Dystonia Torticollis in my neck, back and hands.  A neurological condition, it has affected my posture with tremors and pain. I have liver disease and the neuropathy that can go along with that disease.  I was on Hydrocodone.  After a few hospital visits for my liver, the doctor changed my med to Oxycodone (same milligrams of 7.5).  My husband cuts all of my 15 mg pills in half because there is no 7.5 Oxycodone.  This is done per the Doctor.  My pills are usually from Camber Pharma. They have the side affect of fatigue, no energy, wanting to sleep all day. Two months ago my pharmacy gave me the same pain pills from Amneal Pharma. They helped me.  Lasted longer than 1-2 hours compared to Camber pills.  I was not entirely exhausted all the time, helped control tremors.  By accident I found this info on the internet. You can request a generic Pharma to fill your prescriptions.  PA lists the Pharma initials on the script after the Mg. or call your pharmacy.",Oxycodone
1,Oxycodone,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 29, 2022",0,I have been on the same medication for a while due to all the injuries I have to my back and other areas.  I've been getting the Mallinckrodt 30 mg immediate release oxycodone from the same pharmacy every month and they work great for me with no problems of any kind.  There was an issue at the pharmacy I use this month  so I went somewhere else and ended up with the Rhodes 30 mg oxycodone R P 30mg and these are absolutely horrible.  This is the second day and so far every time I take one of these I get nauseous and sometimes throw up a couple hours later.  It seems like something is not right about this medication.  It's not helping the pain very much and my body seems to be rejecting them.  Not sure what I'm going to do for now but I will NEVER get these again.  Looking forward to next month so I won't have to suffer anymore.,Rhodes 30 mg ox
2,Oxycodone,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 26, 2022",0,"Xtampza ER (oxycodone):Have been on 40 mg ER of oxycontin 2 x a day along with ten  percocet 10/325 and many other drugs for severe chronic pain for 20+ years.  Was made to switch to Xtampza 36 ER 2x a day and 5 percocet.  The Xtampza er is worthless! Shame on whoever decides that a drug works or does not as every individual persons body is different as are their diseases. For people who are responsible and do not have a life without adequate pain relief, you are making us prisoners in our own bodies.  Even with OxyContin 40 ER 2x a day and all the other meds, most of us still suffer plenty.  I am not even 60 and can hardly move with new drug changes.  Have had over 40 surgeries and am full of hardware.  I do not like having to eat the high fat with Xtampza twice a day.  When you are in severe to debilitating pain, you have no appetite.  I am probably 10 pounds over weight but do not need to carry any more weight with eating high fat twice a day as I eat healthy.  Suicide rates will increase with this new drug",LDM

CVS was out of stock a few months back and had to get it from Walmart. It was a different manufacturer called Rhodes Pharmaceuticals, owned by Purdue Pharma. I  noticed there was barely any pain relief, and terrible side effects. Blurry vision, anxiety and feeling like crap. I googled it and saw all of these horrible reviews from people saying the same thing. Then yesterday I picked up my new prescription at CVS and it was Rhodes Pharmaceuticals! Now I'm stuck with this garbage medication for another month. So now I have barely any pain relief, feel like awful from the side effects and I'm livid.

The 20mg oxycodone IR looked like a huge prop pill from a vaudeville sketch!! There is no reason for a pill to be this large, save for the need to cram as much filler in the tablet as possible. My usual pharmacist was not there and the newbie guy did not notice the instruction ""This patient must have KVK brand.I made the mistake (which will never happen again, I assure you!) of not checking that all meds were KVK (and I haven't noticed a drop in efficacy in KVK...Mallinkrodt is up in the air for me, it's subtle; like the pill when you cut it in half is crumbly...bad sign). So, I was stuck with these Rhodes 20mg. which were, no exaggeration, nearly twice the size of a KVK Tech. 20 milligram!Rule of thumb (of course there are exceptions), if you have a 20mg. or 30mg. oxycodone, if the size between the two is negligible, and the outside coating is somewhat glossy, that is usually a quality product.",panickee

Over the years I have changed doses and brands that manufacture them, and I’ve noticed that’s the most important part when taking this medication is getting the right brand. I really can’t stress this enough, some brands are absolutely terrible and should be investigated or the very least sued. Comparing Rhodes Pharma  to KVK tech - the KVK tech is by far the best brand for oxycodone hydrochloride. The Rhodes Pharma formula for this medication is horrible, extremely inefficient, I had to take triple my dose to get any relief and got weird side effects like long lasting headaches. I would rate KVK tech 10/10 for effective but in order to achieve that I need to combine this medication with Gabapentin.",Cowboy

With the other brands she didn't have it easy but was able to get out of bed and sometimes out of the house. Since the switch I have seen a clear, significant downturn in her health. She shows signs of withdrawal (no change in dose) and her pain has increased significantly. It has been so bad that we were forced to miss Thanksgiving and Christmas had to be moved to our house (and paid dearly for it). We tried finding the old medication with no luck.

If I knew how hard it was to come off of the pills I would have rather done anything else and don’t recommend anyone to take any opioids or a medicine with any amount in them. I also recommend not to use longer than 2 weeks. This goes for any other drug close to this unless you are terminally ill and plan to take forever. Morphine and even hydrocodone because it’s an opioid as well. If it has a strong chance of being mentally and physically addictive. Never take it because the pain you have is not as bad as trying to stop it eve if you have only taken it for a couple months.

But what you don't read or hear about is the thousands of people who's lives are made bearable by the use of this medication.  I have had multiple major surgeries following a lifting injury 18 years ago which left me with severe chronic pain caused from nerve damage during surgery. I have successfully taken 30 mg of oxycontin 3 x day for 15 years without ever needing to increase the dosage. The misconception is that pain medication will take away the pain...which is wrong. Pain medication should only be used to take the EDGE off the pain, not eliminate it. Oxycontin can be successfully used to take away enough of the pain over an 8-12 hour period for the patient to be able to at least function. Taking higher doses in order to eliminate the pain is where patients get in trouble, and can have fatal consequences.",Em

571,Oxycodone,Chronic Pain,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 12, 2013",93,OxyContin (oxycodone):This medication is great for my chronic back pain. I have been on the same dose for over two years and it helped me get through most of the day just on two 20mg pills. Lately it has stopped working as well and I am having a lot of breakthrough pain as the OXycontin is extended release and from it working for almost 6 hours per dose it now only helps for about 2 hours. It is great if you are also given something for breakthrough pain but I cannot imagine being off of it to be honest. I have had severe chronic lower back pain due to a pinched nerve which causes shooting pain that goes up and down my spine and even causes my legs to go numb. I also have carpal tunnel in my right hand and fibromyalgia. Overall this medication has been very helpful.,dollface2u
