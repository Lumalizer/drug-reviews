0,Oxycontin,Chronic Pain,,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 19, 2021",1,My father was on this drug along with many other prescribed from the GP. My dad had chronic back pain from scar tissue from a back operation when I was a young child in the 70s .My dad had been on this for 22-26yrs to my knowledge . My dad was hooked on these to survive daily life. Eventually dad got liver damage that is normally due to drink ( alcohol ) my dad didn’t drink & it was medication related. It went to the next stage & he got varices then liver cancer . Dad was lucky to be able to go on a waiting list for another liver. After 4 attempts rushing to be let down yet again .. this time dad was successful . Dad never properly recovered from his liver transplant & was left with herna x 3! Dad went on more meds including his previous meds and same thing again the new liver got damaged . Almost 5 years next month dad had his transplant & 3 months ago my dad died. He died from bleeding to death before us from two clots in his liver & his varices bleeding uncontrollably,Anonymous
1,Oxycontin,Chronic Pain,3.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 14, 2021",1,"I was on oxycodone, followed by oxycontin for 10 years , ending in 2018. I experienced severe claustrophobia. After getting off of Oxycontin (40mg x 4 per day) the claustrophobia disappeared. Most reported side effects do not include claustrophobia,  so I did not immediately make the connection. I used red Bali kratom 1mg capsules 6 times daily to reduce withdrawal symptoms. I eliminated Oxycontin first,  then the Fentanyl patch and finally the .5mg Methadone tablets over a 6 month period.  I would not suggest this drug to anyone other than a terminally ill patient. It robs you of your free will, your creativity and logic.",Filmmaker

My opinion is yes this medicine dose give me a quality of life yet being told by a doctor who I am to trust my life to that its wrong to been given this medicine leaves me questioning  what my life would be today had I never been prescribed it as somewhat suggested or if this medical choice is 100% political influenced cause if so, can I really trust a doctor that makes choices on my health or quality of life based on a political agenda ?

4,Oxycontin,Chronic Pain,10.0,,"December 21, 2020",296,"OxyContin was life restoring for me. I never got high and when my doctor left practice, I tapered myself off without any problems or addiction. Of course, I am suffering greatly because I have to deal with the severe intractable chronic pain again. I was hit twice by an 18-wheeler in the same accident. That, along with several autoimmune disorders, and two rare diseases keep me from participating in life. Unfortunately because some people choose to be stupid and take illicit drugs to get high, those with severe intractable chronic pain are made to suffer, even though we have the lowest rate of addiction and abuse 0.3%.

7,Oxycontin,Chronic Pain,6.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 5, 2020",49,"I was on 4 x 5mg Oxycodone IR for my pain. After a year or so, I felt I needed an extra pill to cover me for 24hrs. Doctor switched me to OxyNeo 2x 10mgs every 12 hours plus 5mg of Oxycodone for breakthrough if needed. The first 2 days I felt great, Oxyneo took care of the pain and I did not feel drowsy or tired. However after the 3rd day, I started feeling very aggitated and angry after I took my oxyneo. I'm not sure what's going on. Has anyone reacted like this to long acting oxycodone?

8,Oxycontin,Chronic Pain,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"April 22, 2020",108,"My problems are like many that I've read on this site.  I take 20 mg. oxycodone (not oxycontin) x 4 daily.  It does enough so that I can have a life.  Still in pain, but as someone wrote, just tamping down the pain is all you can expect.  I just wonder why oxycodone worked when pure morphine did nothing for pain but going thru withdrawal from it was pure nightmare.  I have tried taking myself off oxycodone a few times because I feel ashamed about taking it, you know, can't just keep a stiff upper lip.  Withdrawal from oxycodone was a walk in the park.  How can you take a drug like morphine that has absolutely no effect while oxycodone does help some with fewer side effects.  It just doesn't make sense.  I have come to the conclusion that I am stuck on pain killers for the rest of my life and just don't talk about it.  Maybe they will develop a drug that kills the pain and doesn't cause addiction or dependence.  Why are we still taking drugs that haven't really changed in 60 years or so?",Veeta

He has 6 herniated disks in his back, a bad knee and a bad hip. He is able to run his business and be extremely productive when he has his medication as he is not in pain when he does. But the DEA has started cutting people down simply because some doctors and some patients abused it. Because of the few the majority are being hurt. I bet if the person at the DEA had anyone they know or themselves where in pain they would NEVER make such a careless move as to make doctors afraid to prescribe it in fear of losing their licence to practice.

14,Oxycontin,Chronic Pain,8.0,,"January 25, 2019",59,"I have been on opiates for 15 years now, because of a degenerative condition on my C5 and C6 disks, and a  sterno-clavicular joint with constant sub-luxation and arthrosis. 3 years ago I was prescribed Oxycontin 20mg 2xdaily and for breakthrough pain I simply chew 1/3 to 1/2 of a 20mg Oxycontin tablet. Less side effects than morphine and much better pain management combined with Celecoxib and Paracetamol.  I do not overmedicate when I do not need it, since I had such bad experiences with tramadol addiction, that stuff was vile. Sometimes I take it a few weeks in a row and pause when I can to lessen the habituation and I never will get dependent. 42 pieces of 20mg Oxycontin tabs is enough for like 2 months of quality life as it very effectively takes the edge of the pain that I have every time I am standing or being active for more than a few hours in a row.

16,Oxycontin,Chronic Pain,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"October 29, 2018",108,"My doctor prescribed OxyContin after I'd been hit by an 18 wheeler, rolled down an embankment, and fractured my spine. I'd been taking high doses of acetaminophen for years and had liver damage from Halothane gas and then acetaminophen. He wanted me to take a single dose opioid so that I wasn't taking more acetaminophen. Taking OxyContin was incredible. For the first time in years my pain was under control. I took it for 3 years... Until the ""guidelines"" went into effect. I successfully weaned myself off with no help and without incident. However, I've been bedridden for over two years because I've now exhausted all other things that have been suggested.

17,Oxycontin,Chronic Pain,2.0,,"September 18, 2018",45,I've been a chronic pain patient 5 years now. doctor said try Oxycontin. It would last longer. Tried it for a week. Bad Choice for me as  my pain in morning was a 10 but after trying this pill pain dropped to a 7 which is not terrible but it's not good.  Pills were supposed to last 12 hours nope. Bed time took pill and it helped me sleep. But I would wake up five times a night scratching myself. I think Oxycontin bad choice. The oxycodone fast-acting pills work better because they work super fast. Oxycontin not what advertised. I expected more out of this medication. I need fast acting meds period. I would say give Oxycontin a chance may work for you but don't get your hopes up like I did. On top of that most won't cover it because of the government. The government is pushing back and do not want anybody on these powerful medications And I can't afford to pay out of pocket at $3000 per 100 pills. that just can't happen and that is just way too much money .

18,Oxycontin,Chronic Pain,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 26, 2018",94,"This ""awful drug"" as reported by the media and the internet, has become the evil of prescription pain medication. But what you don't read or hear about is the thousands of people who's lives are made bearable by the use of this medication.  I have had multiple major surgeries following a lifting injury 18 years ago which left me with severe chronic pain caused from nerve damage during surgery. I have successfully taken 30 mg of oxycontin 3 x day for 15 years without ever needing to increase the dosage. The misconception is that pain medication will take away the pain...which is wrong. Pain medication should only be used to take the EDGE off the pain, not eliminate it. Oxycontin can be successfully used to take away enough of the pain over an 8-12 hour period for the patient to be able to at least function. Taking higher doses in order to eliminate the pain is where patients get in trouble, and can have fatal consequences.",Em

I don't know at what level this is occurring .  Whether this is another Government regulation that says if someone is prescribed 60mg tablets the manufacturer is only allowed to put 30mg in that tablet?

63,Oxycontin,Chronic Pain,8.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 23, 2014",154,OxyContin  seems to work really well for pain. But there is that is a  few cons about this medicine for me is that my body would get used to to it and I would need to up the dose. I went from 10mg (2x a day) all the way up to 30  mg (2x a day) It has always only lasted tops 7 hours instead of the advertised 12. It without question has never lasted 12 hours. When I started taking this medicine by the 7 hour my legs would really be on fire again like clock work. So 2 pills would last 14 hours instead of 24 like the manufacturer says. So if you take this medicine make sure you get some breakthrough medicine. Make sure you take Exlax with this medicine. You will be constipated.,Dustinb85
