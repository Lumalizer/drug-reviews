0,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2022",0,"The delivery method for Belbuca does not work as intended. It's supposed to administer the medication by an oral film that dissolves inside the mouth when pressed against the cheek, (buccosa membrane), and thereby allowing the body to absorb the drug. Unfortunately, what happens instead is that as the film melts, (which can take up to 30 minutes), the film slides down the cheek and sticks to the teeth where the medicine cannot be absorbed. Therefore the patient has no idea how much medication has been absorbed, if any.",senecawoman5

2,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 3, 2022",0,"My pain doc added the Belbuca film to my pain management about 4 years ago. I have Medicare, and with a pre-authorization, I have a minimal co-pay.  At first I had some side effects, like pressure on my chest and headaches. This went away in a week.  Belbuca has worked very well for me.  I have fibromyalgia and autoimmune pain, plus chronic fatigue syndrome. I feel like I have a bad case if the flu all the time.  It took some trial and error to finally get the film working the way it should. I keep 20 oz. of water by my bed. When I wake up, I drink the water. I then wait a few minutes for my system to hydrate. This is especially helpful in the morning.  I swish my mouth out vigorously before applying the film. In the evening, after meals or snacks, I have found that any oil, butter or spices stay on the inside of the mouth, preventing the film from sticking.  The slower it absorbs, the better it works.

5,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 19, 2022",0,Not worth the extreme effort. The patches are extremely difficult to get to stick. They curl up and gum up then fall off. The pain control is probably less effective than wishful thinking. It’s crazy that we live in an age where it’s preferable to let people live in misery than to allow them adequate pain control.

My doctor then moved me to Belbuca to try, and it amazes me as how effective it has been plus a lot safer to use. I highly recommend giving Belbuca a try. It takes some getting use to applying it, but once you get that down, it is highly effective. What a relief not to be on OxyContin anymore!",Harley
10,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,2.0,,"October 17, 2021",1,"My doctor switched me to Belbuca 150mg cut in half so 75mg twice a day.

I have serious back condition and I need to replace my right hip again because it never healed correctly. The belbuca does nothing for my hip. I was on Hydrocodone 10/325 and if I took 3 and a half a day I received more relief than belbuca every did. I’m so frustrated because I have no life now.

Then up to 150mg  and now 300mg. I was hoping to find the magic solution. As I tried this for many months  I am still in so much pain. Yes Belbuca has touched a little bit of the pain but it has not helped the way my Dr had me think.   My doctor said you are on so much medication that this is compared to morphine. I said you've got to be kidding this is not morphine I can't even feel it.

17,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 6, 2021",2,Belbuca sucks. It makes you feel awful and has nearly no pain relieving effects. It makes you really irritable and angry and it blocks the effects of stronger opioid medications. This stuff belongs in the trash.,GI

20,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 4, 2021",9,"My doctor suggested Belbuca after I became allergic to Buprenorphine patches.  According to the literature in the package, however, my dose is quite low for a maintenance dose. The goal is for me to be able to do the exercise (walking) my neurosurgeon prescribed so that I may rebuild the muscles in my back after fusions.   The Belbuca film sticks to my fingers, teeth, and tongue far more easily than my cheek.  I must inflate my cheek for 30 minutes while it dissolves, after which it melts down into a gummy glob of mucilage stuck to my teeth and gums.  Secondly, the pain relief is for only ten hours, and yet it is prescribed for every 12 hours.  I don't understand why the pain relief doesn't last long enough, but I'll discuss this with my doctor.   I very much appreciate the emails with tips and encouragement, but the savings card is not very helpful.

21,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,4.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 28, 2021",261,I've been in pain management for 23 years. I've been on everything from Vicodin 2 fentanyl patch 2 Belbuca. The Belbuca 900 ... isn't bad. But it's also not great. It definitely takes the edge off but not really to a point where I can live a normal life. :( I started on a much lower dose almost 3 yrs ago. I was weaned off the fentanyl patch 50mcg. The best thing about Belbuca... I don't start withdrawals on the last day like I did with the fentanyl patch. But I do literally pray often that the med field will come up with an idea for a chronic pain med that works like the fentanyl patch but that 1. really stays attached to your skin AND 2.does not cause withdrawals at all. With Belbuca... I'm not in a state of panic when the patch peels off or before its time to apply another patch.They can send a man to the moon but can't control constant severe pain. Ooo wait-we CAN control pain but because some people abuse pain medication.... innocent people have to be punished.,1PrettyMess

I was actually the first in the pain management practice to use Belbuca and transitioned from Butrans (a weekly HUGE patch I applied to my back weekly) and had a very smooth transition. One of the things that I like about Belbuca is that if I am feeling good on a particular day I have the option of skipping a dose or two (doesn't happen often but it does happen). I didn't have that option with Butrans.  For me, the combination of Savella and Belbuca has allows me to keep working full time and I am grateful for it",timothyrcullen

People on these reviews can say all they want about how great this medicine works but I can tell you from a past of taking many different pain medications that Belbuca does not work well at all. Trust me I know what a good pain medicine is and it is for sure not Belbuca. It is a complete joke forced on us because of the government. People with pain want a drug that works so they can get their life back not some government forced drug thats supposed to be less addictive that does nothing at all.

These are very strong medication, but cannot be abused like pills or liquids. I’ve been on this medication now for a week. I am very very happy with it.

I was taking percocet prn and not controlled when I was finally told I had to go to Pain Management because the laws had changed and no other docs could give me what I needed. My pain management doctor has me up to 450 µg and says that if I feel I need more than all I need to do is let him know. But he also gives me Percocet for breakthrough pain because he knows that I won’t abuse it and I only take it when I have to.

49,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 4, 2020",248,"I have been stuck with horrible chronic pain from PLDS (post-Lyme disease syndrome). first I was prescribed oxycodone, I hated the side effects. Apathy, brain fog, severe constipation, sweats, nausea, headaches... I was miserable. I fired my pain Dr and signed up for a chronic pain MAT program.They prescribed Belbuca and I’m very satisfied with my experience. It helps with pain as well as the oxy did, but the apathy and brain fog are pretty much gone. On my correct dose I have no nausea, headaches or other icky side effects. I’m free from the endless rollercoaster of pain and withdrawals between doses, and having to make sure I have opiates with me at all times just in case.A word of caution regarding the bad reviews. Some of them may not have given the medication enough time to find the right dose for them. Others it may not work for, but for me Belbuca controls pain and doesn’t make you high - to me that’s a good thing, I can be a full participant in my life again.",Missy

My brother took injections for four years and now he is in a wheel chair for life.

I have psoriatic arthritis and fibromyalgia. I took it and it made me feel horrible. I was in bed all day and had to call off of work because I was in excruciating pain. It just made me want to sleep I could not believe the price and I could only afford two patches $29. My prescription was for  100  at $566 He prescribed me 300mcg and I will never take it again. I take hydrocodone to control my pain which works for me. I don't want to go on anything stronger so he tried this out and obviously I would give it a zero if that was an option. Everybody is different but I would not purchase the entire prescription without trying one or two patches before you spend that kind of money on it. I read the reviews and I tried it anyway and I would have to agree with the bad reviews.,Dawn

She is trying to be proactive in moving some patients that she could off of the schedule II's and onto a lower schedule pain medicine. I commend her for this, as we still have some time right now to do this instead of being forced to. Not to mention, my intestines have issues absorbing pills due to the many surgeries I have had...so the cheek patch is a definite benefit for me.I have been titrating upward to the top dose, now at 900 mcgs every 12 hours. I have noticed that it isn't perfect, but certainly can hold it's own. It takes away a good portion of the pain for roughly 8ish hours (supposed to be 12, but realistically for me is 8).

DO NOT tell them this doesn't work. They'll take it & give you NOTHING until you've successfully begged & groveled.. I was BLESSED to find a Neurologist thats also PM. THEYRE OUT THERE. LOOK!!!! They're ALL run this way. Thx to real junkies &  Trump they're all getting worse as he villianizes actual pain sufferers. I'm in NC & go from Charlotte to Raleigh to see my PM MD...its worth the trip! To ALL....PLZ PLZZZZZ find better doctors because you will DIE waiting for help thru ANY of the so called pain mgmt",LuxsMom

It may be suitable to help relieve withdrawal from other opioids but it has no effect to relieve pain for me.Since the drug manufactures have changed the formulas in hydrocodone, there are no more  medications except Percocet  or Zohydro that will provide relief.Expect to live in pain now as the result of opioid scam which has practically eliminated manufacturers like Activis which made safe and effective Norco.

135,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,8.0,,"August 5, 2018",63,I have had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for many years and have dealt with chronic pain for majority of my life. I just started Belbuca about a week ago I was skeptical and a bit scared at first after reading reviews. I was on ext release morphine every 12 hours and oxycodone for break through pain I was averaging 1-4 a day. My doctor started me on 300mg Belbuca every 12 hours and let me keep my oxycodone for the break through pain. So far I am pretty happy. I have noticed since Starting the Belbuca I have only had to take 2  pain pills for break through pain (that’s two in over a week whereas I was taking that daily before) I seem to be in a lot less pain and have been able to be more active I am extremely happy so far the only negative is that I have been experiencing a lot of frequent headaches I am not sure if it’s coincidence or because of the Belbuca however I will take headaches over chronic joint pain any day,RAfighter

My Pain Management (PM) Doc she liked the idea of the Belbucca Patches because they are an extended release medicine and can help cover when my Percocet starts to wear off. That’s what Belbucca is good for, helping with break thru pain. My PM Doc Started me on 75 mcg. She just upped it to 300 mcg. I can tell a  difference in the pain. It’s not as severe as it use to be, I have absolutely no side effects at all, the patch is super tiny, tastes minty, about the size of the tip of an eraser on a pencil , it sticks to the cheek with no problem. Don’t drink or eat till it’s dissolved.  When you first put the patch on the inside of your cheek take your tongue and press it up against there and take some extra saliva and push it over the patch and it’ll stick with no problem. It doesn’t give you that drowsy drugged up feeling like some meds do, you can still go on with your daily activities that you normally do with no problems. Hope this helps!",Tori

My daughter died in October of 2016 of an accidental opioid overdose and I decided I didn’t want to take pain pills anymore. I was referred to a pain clinic and offered Belbuca. I have been on the Belbuca since January of 2017. I started on the 300mg and I have worked my way up to the 900mg. At first I hated it and it didn’t help me.  But as my dosages got stronger I began to notice a big difference in my pain. The Belbuca works for me now better than the pain pills did. I have a more constant level of pain control and I do not feel high like I did when I was taking the pain pills. I think that is one reason people don’t think Belbuca is working.

I was first prescribed Butrans patches 20mcg and they worked great, but they can sweat off in the  Texas summer heat, so I was given Belbuca 450mcg. They work just as wonderfully as the patches did.  I have never had a problem opening them.  I also have found that if I don't talk while the film dissolves it doesn't curl up or mess up in any way.  There is a video on the belbuca website showing exactly how to place them.  This medicine changed my life.  I have arthritis and DDD in my back and neck, disk herniations, nerve pain in my arms because my neck needs surgery, and I still live normally due to this medicine. I recommend!",Flstorm

The pain Dr decided to switch me to this new pain medicine with promising results. This is my 3rd dose and stomach pain and nausea begin 45 min after every single dose. It seems to subside a little towards the 8th hour or so. This medicine has 0 effect on pain just creates more by adding the stomach pain. This medicine is being pushed because it has a low potential for abuse thanx to the junkies.That's fine but make sure it works before u release it. All of the complaints about this drug will make it a short lived one. Doctors will push it hard in the beginning but patients will push back.

I have arthritis in my right knee from two knee surgeries. I started out with trying many different oral pain meds. I was tired of taking so many pills with hardly any pain relief. I asked my physician about Suboxone, she prescribe it for my pain; I was sooo happy!! No high/lows and I felt myself again!  Then, my insurance stopped covering it, unless prescribed for addiction. I was prescribed Subutex 8 mg 2x/day which worked just as well; insurance still refused payment. After a year I was given Belbuca 450 mcg every 12hrs; insurance paid. I'm not getting near the relief I was when on Subutex. Don't like it!!",Not happy!!!

The medication can be difficult to remove from the foil package, but I'm getting better at it. My experience has been some pain relief without brain fog. We will see how this goes. I still have Percocet for break out pain. Also, it's important to note that even after 1 1/2 hrs. the patch hasn't completely dissolved.

I have been on all kinds of pain medication. I don't know what to do. I don't like how the medication makes me feel. It's too expensive even with insurance. There is no way I can afford this medication. Without the coupon I would of paid $120.00. I got to my pain doctor on Tuesday. I am hoping that I am taken off this and put on something else.

180,Belbuca,Chronic Pain,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 25, 2016",20,"I was prescribed Suboxone, buprenorphine, for chronic pain in 2004. When the patch, Butrans, came along, I was given that, but it itched too much. Recently, I moved to an area that virtually has no idea that buprenorphine is great for pain relief. After much suffering, I found someone who would prescribe it for such, but my insurance also is behind the times and so after a few $200 copays, I heard about Belbuca so I tried it. After a couple of doses, I figured out the best way to open the pouch, and for the most part, it dissolved fine. The problem is its just too weak. The highest dose didn't cut it for me. I gave it up and accepted the generic sublingual tablets of buprenorphine, which are covered by my insurance. They are fine.",supragee

I have chronic back pain had 2 surgeries. I personal love the medication it works for me and as far as having nausea absoulety none at all. Every one say they got nausea, maybe u need to start out at a low dose. I am on the highest dose and i love it. yes the film does stick but its not bad to me.so to anyone out there i suggest everyone is different and give it a try. idk maybe it works best for different kinds of pain. when i was on oxycontin now that made me nausea and felt like i could't breathe..",lexy1234

Medication packet you will need scissors, wet buccal area of mouth and doesn't adhere as directed, doesn't dissolve, sticks to teeth, end up swallowing it. As for the pain, it remains. Very expensive with no rx coverage for Belbuca. Phone number on the card and brochure from my doctor, inaccurate, and one month free trial and reduced rate doesn't apply to me. Tried to get renewal from office but they are strict on pickup dates for Rx's, claimed I didn't call for renewal and once I was halfway home oh here it is. The pharmacy did not even carry it.

Virtually no pain relief, only nausea, intermit diarrhea, headaches and vertigo.  It does NOT sick to the inside of your cheek, as everytime you swallow it moves around and either sticks to your teeth or you swallow it. Horrible, horrible medication. Films often crack in half by the time you can finally pry them out of the foil and they are so small that if you have an sort of tremor, as I do, they often fall out of my fingers. IMO, they need to scrap the whole thing and start over. Horrible.",Anonyn

For pain control, it has been okay, not the best, I have been on this 2 months at the 300 level, I was just switched to the 600 level, so we will see if it improves. Buckle delivery is different - placing it on your cheek, it does not always dissolve, even when the mouth is wet. It does leave a residue on my teeth and cheek, again with a wet mouth as instructed.  It is some times un able to sick, wet ten mouth and all, so it will curl up and I end up swolling it, but not able to dose again until 12 hours later.
