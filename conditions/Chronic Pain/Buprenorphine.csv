1,Buprenorphine,Chronic Pain,,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 22, 2022",0,"Belbuca (buprenorphine):The delivery method for Belbuca does not work as intended. It's supposed to administer the medication by an oral film that dissolves inside the mouth when pressed against the cheek, (buccosa membrane), and thereby allowing the body to absorb the drug. Unfortunately, what happens instead is that as the film melts, (which can take up to 30 minutes), the film slides down the cheek and sticks to the teeth where the medicine cannot be absorbed. Therefore the patient has no idea how much medication has been absorbed, if any.",senecawoman5

Nothing touched my pain. I put on my first butrans patch last night before bed and when I woke up, for the first time in my existence, I was not in any pain. I don’t know if this will last, but for now I am overwhelmed with gratitude. My doc started me on the lowest dose and I still have Norco for breakthrough pain. Percocet got my pain from a 10 down to a 7. Butrans has reduced my pain to a 2. I’ve literally never had such a low level of pain in mylife. Give it a try. For me it seems to be a miracle.

I have Medicare, and with a pre-authorization, I have a minimal co-pay.  At first I had some side effects, like pressure on my chest and headaches. This went away in a week.  Belbuca has worked very well for me.  I have fibromyalgia and autoimmune pain, plus chronic fatigue syndrome. I feel like I have a bad case if the flu all the time.  It took some trial and error to finally get the film working the way it should. I keep 20 oz. of water by my bed. When I wake up, I drink the water. I then wait a few minutes for my system to hydrate. This is especially helpful in the morning.  I swish my mouth out vigorously before applying the film. In the evening, after meals or snacks, I have found that any oil, butter or spices stay on the inside of the mouth, preventing the film from sticking.  The slower it absorbs, the better it works.

7,Buprenorphine,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 19, 2022",0,Belbuca (buprenorphine):Not worth the extreme effort. The patches are extremely difficult to get to stick. They curl up and gum up then fall off. The pain control is probably less effective than wishful thinking. It’s crazy that we live in an age where it’s preferable to let people live in misery than to allow them adequate pain control. Socialistic medicine at its best.,James

It worked well on being able to focus and my  cognitive abilities. However in the summer of 2021, I started having bad stomach problems and depression that I felt was chemically induced. I started tapering off and got down to 1/4 a pill 2x a day. I transferred to the patch but I experienced bad headaches.  And it was not enough pain relief. I have tapered off other pain medicines much easier to get off them. I worry that I am going to be stuck taking this medicine forever. I am going to ask my doctor today if there is another alternative to using this medication. I remember that getting off of generic Percuset (oxycodone)  was much easier when I went through some cancer pain. Be wary of long term use of this medication.",Diane457

The pain became so extreme, I had several shingles outbreak and then the shingles went into my nervous system (Postherpetic neuralgia). I did some research about Subutex trials for fibro pain.

13,Buprenorphine,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 23, 2021",0,"I have been on most forms and dosages of buprenorphine over several years (BuTrans, Belbuca, buprenorphine sublingual tablets) due to complications from injuries sustained in the military, and most recently, advanced arthritis.  I’m 34 years old, and have other non-pain related medical conditions that were well controlled before going back on the tablets. Of the three methods of ingestion, I will say that the tablets seem to have the most efficacy; however a 1:10 vs a 0:10 isn’t exactly something to write home about. Perhaps the worst thing about this med aside from the inefficiency is the stigma attached to it. If I ask for alternative treatment, I must be a drug addict. On this medication I can’t drive longer than 10 min, stand long enough to cook or do most activities with my kids. I simply exist at this point. This isn’t life.

I have a list of issues that caused my pain including fracturing my back. I was on every pain medication you can think of down to injectable hydromorphone. Every injury I got I had to increase doses for the pain meds to work… I was so tired of being on the rollercoaster of ride. I felt like the pain was taking me down…it got super costly because insurance wouldn’t cover any of the meds anymore.  I finally decided I am DONE!! I went into detox treatment to say good by once and for all to all the pain meds. I was given subutex in treatment to detox me off all the other crap. It was still a rough detox because if you take too soon after stopping the other meds you go through precipitated withdrawals. Lucky me… anyways subutex saved my life. I am now on 2 x 8mg in morning and half at evening. Subutex manages my pain way better than even hydromorphone. It lasts much longer than any other med too. I really have my life back now.,Brenni

It definitely takes the edge off but not really to a point where I can live a normal life. :( I started on a much lower dose almost 3 yrs ago. I was weaned off the fentanyl patch 50mcg. The best thing about Belbuca... I don't start withdrawals on the last day like I did with the fentanyl patch. But I do literally pray often that the med field will come up with an idea for a chronic pain med that works like the fentanyl patch but that 1. really stays attached to your skin AND 2.does not cause withdrawals at all. With Belbuca... I'm not in a state of panic when the patch peels off or before its time to apply another patch.They can send a man to the moon but can't control constant severe pain.

Till finally the scenario got really out of hand.Due to a rash that I've had since 2007 I was taken off at my next visit and put on Buccal. That was a nightmare with extreme to point of dehydration. I stopped and was put on 10mcg Butrans. It started causing sweating and mid back pain. Not sure if it's the Butrans or that it's the higher dose. Removed and after 2 days had to go back on.Bottom line. If you have Fibromyalgia I highly recommend giving it a try.I'm waiting on my next visit to lower the dose and hopefully get rid of this sweating.Being out of pain and able to sleep and enjoy life again is worth everything.Wish I had known about this somewhere in those 32 years.,TinLuckShe

One of the things that I like about Belbuca is that if I am feeling good on a particular day I have the option of skipping a dose or two (doesn't happen often but it does happen). I didn't have that option with Butrans.  For me, the combination of Savella and Belbuca has allows me to keep working full time and I am grateful for it",timothyrcullen

Doctors would not prescribe opiates for my condition, and the doses of buprenorphine indicated for pain are inadequate. I went to an addiction treatment facility to get bupe at the higher dose used to treat addicts. This got me an effective dose, which is also covered on more insurance formularies. It sucks going to such clinics, but ""rehab"" may be your only practical option - presenting as an addict for treatment. It's a bit disingenuous but not essentially dishonest. It's a consequence of bad policy moreso than bad choices. If this still doesn't work, there's always methadone.

Not only that but I get extremely nauseous and get a BAD headache. I have to take tylenol and benadryl to sleep when I take it and the when I wake up I feel like I have a hangover - the side effects from this drug are worse than anything I had ever experienced on Oxycodone, and then added side effects from benadryl compound it.
