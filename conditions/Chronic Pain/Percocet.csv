0,Percocet,Chronic Pain,8.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"March 23, 2022",1,"Hurt SI joint 8.5 yrs ago. Took ibuprofen for about a year back surgeon prescribed codeine , did not help, then prescribed norco , worked but bad side effects.  Then percocet.  I get by on taking as little as possible as I am a recovering addict.  Always 3 or less a day dose is 5/325  . It helps stop the excruciating pain but brings on other not wanted side effects of numb leg and sciatica as I compensate for back pain. It is what it is . Until they come up with a surgery or better meds , this is my life . Dependent on opioids.",Hijack

4,Percocet,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 15, 2021",114,I've been on my meds since 1997. I was in a car accident crushed against a tree in my car. I didn't start my meds during the craziness. Over 20 years my pain meds keep me normal. I've been with the same pharmacy for about 4 years. I have never given them a problem. In the beginning of this month he claimed to of not had my usual brand. I desperately asked him how it will affect me and is this only once. He told me it's the same different manufacturers and that he hasn't gotten any of my normal ones. I trusted his word. Then once I tried them I called him and complained explaining this is not working. He also suggested I go somewhere else I explained to him that is not right I simply want what I know works for me. I am praying that when it's my next pick up he gives me what I'm supposed to have. This particular brand of percocet has been making me sick it's not a mind thing it's physical pain. U17 are the barings on the pill  the brand is Aurolife Pharma LLC and they do not serve there purpose. Please don't make the same mistakes as I did. We have rights,Nena

The generics suck and don't do much for pain as I had to keep switching between them (so long on 1 and then so long on the other) but the Brand Percocet does work, for me anyway. I was even reduced from 5/day to 3/day and it's still working. NO addiction and NO dependence, my strength is 10/325. The ins co wants to put me on generics again not because they care about me it's the cost.Quality of life, along with other meds, is better but far from great.

8,Percocet,Chronic Pain,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 18, 2020",59,"If you find that this medication doesn’t help you, it could be your liver lacks the enzyme to break it down. This medication also made me feel depressed- and I actually am a very happy person- so I knew I wasn’t depressed, but couldn’t shake the feeling of flatness.Also, this medication did almost nothing for my pain from severe facet arthritis, DDD and stenosis. I found 40 minutes later it felt like I had to take it again - Thankfully my Dr switched me to something that does work, but I had a genetic test done for medication and found out I lack an enzyme to break the med down to the active form. I also found out that the reason for my mood problems is because this drug interacts with the Kappa receptor, which can cause dysphoria.Not great for me, but I know many people find relief with it. If you don’t or have the above experience- ask for a genetic test for pain medication- it is very helpful.",Jinx342
