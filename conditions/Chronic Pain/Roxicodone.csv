Now with Roxicodone I am up and walking, doing, being! I was under medicated during the war on opioid abuse, an anesthesiologist made adjustments and within months I regained strength. 30mg 3x day has given me a measure of my freedom back.",Wetapunga

3,Roxicodone,Chronic Pain,8,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 9, 2019",26,I broke my back and had an artificial disc to put in and then device failed and I was put on roxycodone 30 mg and oxycodone works better for me than hydrocodone and even better than the Dilaudid the Dilaudid and hydrocodone doesn't last not an hour for some reason on me if I got Dilaudid through an IV it would hit me hard and take away the pain for about 30 minutes and then it would will go away fast the oxycodone for whatever reason works better for me,Day Day badsurgerybaddevice
4,Roxicodone,Chronic Pain,10,,"September 14, 2019",26,"After being on methadone for tonsil cancer and going through radiation the methadone only made me sick in the stomach with no pain relief, Roxicodone has not gave me any bad side effects and I'm even on Xanax but I do not abuse them and take them as little as possible, however the Roxicodone liquid seems to take your pain and bad thoughts away so you may not even need your nerve pill, it also tastes like a good cherry flavor but boy is the radiation painful to the throat. I'm trying to wait the pain out but it's pretty severe. But the Roxicodone takes a good deal of it away and is much better than methadone in my opinion.",Panic attack Jack

6,Roxicodone,Chronic Pain,2,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 12, 2019",89,"FYI-as other sleuths such as myself have discovered: the CAMBER brand oxycodone (I get prescribed 15mg) are JUNK! For the last two months, this is ALL my mom and pop shoppe have had in stock allegedly and I’m telling you, they are BOGUS or FAKES. My doc has even written on my scripts DO NOT fill with CAMBER BRAND and the pharmacy still has, so I was stuck with them. Plus, sarcasm, it’s so easy to just transfer a CONTROLLED MED script to a NEW pharmacy-LOL- they’ll give you the junkie glare or straight up lie and say they don’t carry it. Lol. This whole nightmare has become such a blatant and laughable joke really. We (legit pain patients) are on to ALL of you playing this game with our lives. The jig is up.",Dani Lare
7,Roxicodone,Chronic Pain,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 5, 2019",45,Been on and off of it for intractable pain and trigeminal neuralgia for 10 years . I was taking 30 mg every 4 hours or 6×day. That work for me for a long time until my doctor  of 14 years retired and it's been downhill from there. Now I'm only prescribed 30mg 3 times a day and thinking about what are the options I have because when you're on these drugs for so long you don't have adequate relief or adequate medication it just leaves you and I state of withdrawal and increased sensitivity to pain,Bellboi
8,Roxicodone,Chronic Pain,8,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 14, 2018",17,I have taken these as a med for breakthrough pain in addition to oxymorphone 30 mg ER. The roxycodone is quite beneficial in helping to control my chronic pain. I would rather have the brand name with these but it is too expensive.,Mickie
9,Roxicodone,Chronic Pain,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"May 18, 2018",30,"As a chronic pain patient,  I have not found a better treatment  than roxicodone for myself. The side effects are minimal at best.",SillyRabit
10,Roxicodone,Chronic Pain,9,Taken for 10 years or more,"November 19, 2017",52,"I have had chronic back and neck pain since 2002. I have had back surgery twice and neck surgery once.  I have tried a lot of different options and the OxyContin, Oxycodone combination has been the best for me. Since the onset of all this ""Opioid crisis"" has happen it has been harder and harder to get my meds. The old saying ""don't let one bad apple spoil the whole bunch"" says it all. That's what the government has done, let a few bad apples spoil the whole bunch. People that need these meds need them and with the way it is now doctors don't want to give them out. If I could I would get off them in an instance but my life is miserable without them from the pain I have so here I am, stuck getting what I can to get at least some relief.",joekewl26
11,Roxicodone,Chronic Pain,4,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 3, 2016",22,"Itchy, itchy! I've found opioids analgesics are the best for my chronic pain.  Roxicodone caused pruritis for me. That might not seem like a big deal. However, when dealing with pain that's been constant for years, a side effect like non stop itching is one more thing that magnifies the pain. Then there's pain, itching, and more loss of sleep.There were a couple of remedies. The doctor rxing a different medicine. Or taking an antihistamine to overcome the itching. In today's current anti-opioid environment, doctors seem more likely to throw up their hands, and say, ""Well I guess you're just not a good candidate for opioids!"" Which just isn't true. Switching worked like a charm for me.",gems21

13,Roxicodone,Chronic Pain,8,Taken for 10 years or more,"March 4, 2016",146,I have to laugh when I read some of these comments . Why do I itch ? Because you are taken too much ! Listen I take 7 pills a day of oxycotin 80 mgs and 15 pills a day of roxy 30mgs because a doctor years ago decided it would be the best thing for me and it was the worst thing he ever did to me . I take over 210 80s a month and 450 30s that's is 660 pills a month yes one month !  I would tell anyone do not take these meds I am so addicted to these now and now with Obama and the DEA against them doctors are being told to take ppl off them well that's great now I deal with the withdrawal and it's terrible please please please if you really need the meds take them with caution they become so so addictive doesn't matter who you are,Wishineverstarted

Vicodin didn't sustain my pain nearly as much as Roxicodone does. My Pain Doctor prescribed me 15 mg of Oxycodone (Roxicodone) six times a day. This medication has literally given me my life back. It simply takes my pain away for hours and I can function 100% better. I take this along with MS Contin and a muscle relaxer. 10/10 rating!",LivingAliveNow
16,Roxicodone,Chronic Pain,8,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 12, 2015",55,"After working with the top Doc in the field of Pain Management  (Philadelphia ) for years, I ended up on Roxicodone.  We literally tried everything available/appropriate before resorting to narcotics.  Some things worked for a while & then stopped, some meds caused awful side effects.  Roxicodone works well for me;it doesn't provide 100% relief, but is better than other things I've tried.",phylmik
17,Roxicodone,Chronic Pain,9,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"June 29, 2015",66,"I've delt with chronic pain the last 11 years, since I was 23. And as anyone with chronic pain knows, it's never going to completely go away.  We just want a break, some type of relief from the constant agony.In the wiiiide variety of opiod pain meds, roxicodone has brought me the most consistent pain relief paired with my muscle relaxer (Baclofen). I swear I've tried just about everything,  trying to find that ""happy medium"" I personally try to find the least amount of medication I need to be on to function. These seem to do that for me, aside from fentanyl patches and then a med for break thru. Everyone is a bit different though, and our tolerance for medications and how our body metabolizes it varies as well.  But for me, it works!!",SiNisterBarbieDoll®
18,Roxicodone,Chronic Pain,6,,"June 4, 2015",23,"I noticed that a side effect or roxicodone is body aches and pains.  The reason I am taking it is because of chronic, severe body aches and pains, especially in my lower back and legs.  Is the remedy causing the problem?

20,Roxicodone,Chronic Pain,9,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"January 30, 2015",73,"I have been given many choices for my breakthrough pain medication while being on methadone but I have always stuck with the oxycodone. I chose oxycodone without Tylenol because Tylenol causes major GI upset since I suffer from Gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying). I find it to be very effective in the combination I'm on, the only downside of oxycodone I find with myself is that if it's taken by itself it can cause insomnia which I find to be very annoying.",Jenn Claus

The least you take ,the more effective in pain reduction.  For anybody using any opiate for recreational use has no idea what the complications ahead in time. Not only losing everyday enjoyment.

Trust me you don't need the extra stress, NO body that takes this medication prescribed by a doctor, wants to suffer not only from chronic pain but then physically/mental stress that comes with opiate use .

It was killing my stomach but since my doctor changed it to just roxicodone without acetaminophen I feel much better. It definitely helps with the pain.

That also led to a fractured C5, nerve damage, & a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
