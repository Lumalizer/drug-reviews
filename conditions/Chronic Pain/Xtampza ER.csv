0,Xtampza ER,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 26, 2022",0,"Have been on 40 mg ER of oxycontin 2 x a day along with ten  percocet 10/325 and many other drugs for severe chronic pain for 20+ years.  Was made to switch to Xtampza 36 ER 2x a day and 5 percocet.  The Xtampza er is worthless! Shame on whoever decides that a drug works or does not as every individual persons body is different as are their diseases. For people who are responsible and do not have a life without adequate pain relief, you are making us prisoners in our own bodies.  Even with OxyContin 40 ER 2x a day and all the other meds, most of us still suffer plenty.  I am not even 60 and can hardly move with new drug changes.  Have had over 40 surgeries and am full of hardware.  I do not like having to eat the high fat with Xtampza twice a day.  When you are in severe to debilitating pain, you have no appetite.  I am probably 10 pounds over weight but do not need to carry any more weight with eating high fat twice a day as I eat healthy.  Suicide rates will increase with this new drug",LDM
1,Xtampza ER,Chronic Pain,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 8, 2022",0,"So far the main draw back is the complicated requirements for administration, the doctor says to open the capsule and put in food.  The pharmacist says opening the capsule is more risky and reduces amount absorbed.  All very confusingd an time will tell on effectiveness.  Pain control is moderate and requires additional opioid boosts to maintain pain control daily with out loss of relief.  More time may alter my personal rating",sgtwildbill2003

So we tried a few other long term meds which help but wasn't lasting the full length that they were supposed to last for so I asked my doctor to put me on another long term med and he put me on Xtampza ER 36mg and this new med Xtampza 36mg does not even work.

3,Xtampza ER,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 20, 2022",5,"I've been a pain patient for nearly 20 years due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  Switched from generic MS Contin 15mg twice a day to Xtampza 13.5mg twice a day.  One word:  torture.  Constant GI upset with diarrhea and feeling like my insides are writhing with worms.  A complete lack of dreaming (no darkness, just like being turned off and on again) with horrifying intrusive thoughts and mood swings.  Pain in parts of my body where I didn't have pain before, or where pain was previously well-controlled.  Feeling dangerously high and then going into total withdrawal (I kept the Narcan on my bedside table and told my family to check on me).  I took it with a fatty meal, the same meal every time, and had a different experience every 12 hours.  At no time did I feel safe taking this medication.  This has left me feeling terrified to try anything else and suspicious of my doctor's reasons for switching me.  I firmly believe this medication was manufactured to scare people away from opioids.",Kat

I never had any issues with Purdue pharmaceuticals Oxycontin. This Xtampza is a joke. Dr. is force tapering & switched me to 36 Mg Xtampza ER 2 x A day. My dose was lowered by 40 mg a Day in one go. I'm experiencing horrific withdrawals and this medication is NOT working at all. Twice a day is not enough. The bioavailability is all over the board and way to inconsistent depending on high fat food. This medication should be pulled off the market. Does NOT last anywhere near a 12 hour period. The ""Studies"" showing it does are a damn LIE. It's all about the addicts now. Guess what? Those addicts will keep using & move on. However, Chronic Pain Patients are being force tapered, thrown to the streets and left to find for themselves. Many are paying for this with their lives. Something needs to change here.

8,Xtampza ER,Chronic Pain,3.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 15, 2021",2,Well I've been on this about a year now after being on 15mg oxycontin for 2 years. I finally felt like my pain was being controlled and was able to do more for myself. When my Medicare stopped covering it and was put on 13.5mg Xtampza. Since then my pain is not controlled and now I have unexplained stomach attacks that have been getting worse and more often. And last week they cut me back half on my 5mg break thru pills from 2 a day to 1 a day. I feel trapped in a broken painful body that will never go away. I am now struggling to even cook dinners for my kids now. No one is protecting chronic pain sufferers from opioid abusers.,Discussed

10,Xtampza ER,Chronic Pain,5.0,,"August 24, 2021",0,"I was switched from 40 mg oxycontin very suddenly w/o warning after being on oxcontin since 2009. The first couple weeks it took 3 hours to get relief, & at hour 5 became extremely tired & pain comes back. Now 5 months later, it takes a full 5 hrs for 80% relief of pain. And still at hr 3/4 I get extremely tired, and have to wait till it starts working. I NEVER sleep through the night anymore, as its usually worn off after 7 hrs, 8 hrs max, & then I'm almost useless. It is the worst pain reliever I've had outside of morphine. Instant oxycodone works best so I don't have waves constantly. The oxycontin also worked better, but w/o anything for breakthrough pain, I have no life anymore, or social life. I cannot go on any long drives or trips, & avoid all events in the evening, & early morning. My days are all timed. I was sick for about 4 days after the switch & my Dr stated I wouldn't notice any difference. I have a bad tear in C4 caused by a forced procedure, metal neck, 2 torn knees.",Faithrile
11,Xtampza ER,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 12, 2021",3,Unless you can wake up and eat a high fat/high calorie meal this drug sucks. You cannot get it to release all of the drug without it. Read ALL of the documentation. Otherwise you only get about 40% of the meds. I would tell anyone who has been prescribed this go back and ask for morphine sulfate(generic OxyContin). It is a LOT cheaper and much more effective.,Kingbuba
12,Xtampza ER,Chronic Pain,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"July 11, 2021",5,"You have to take Xtampza  with about 12 to 14 grams of fat.

13,Xtampza ER,Chronic Pain,8.0,,"May 13, 2021",86,"I've been a severely compromised patient for well over 4 years with chronic low back pain. I was put on an Xtampza regimen with breakthrough rescue of oxycodone. I reviewed their application to the FDA but it has a fatal flaw . It must be taken with a HCHF (High Calorie High Fat) diet/food. If you compare the blood levels with LCLF or MCMF (low calorie low fat, medium calorie medium fat) or a fasting state, it won't get the job done. Also, if you sprinkle it on food with a HCHF diet, you will find the onset about 1-2 hours faster, but the peak effect is lower, while it still lasts about 8-10 hours. If you ingest it as a whole capsule, it will take 2-3 hours to start to work. The company has done A POOR job of communicating how to take it. My guess is you probably need about 30 grams of fat to guarantee you get absorption and efficacy. That's about 270 calories. Unfortunately, no one has told us this.",Frustrated
14,Xtampza ER,Chronic Pain,3.0,,"May 12, 2021",16,"Was forced to Xtrampza from former med , this medicine was I believe to make you ill , sick , so you don’'t want to take it . That designer drug works to make you sick . But doesn’t work to well on pain and takes hours and hours to get any pain relieving effect at all . It is also inaccurate on how they are made , there must be no controls on the manufacturer process . The 4 score is accurate, many are being forced to this medication even though it’s not effective and takes way too long to work if at all and it’s just as expensive as Perdue . I would not recommend this med unless you have no other choice and you’ll just have to force it down and be sick to try to get any pain relief at all . Take it with a NSAIDs or Tylenol if your doctor allows it . But just remember how dangerous NSAIDs and Tylenol are . Don’t take that like it’s nothing . Good luck on this one.

So far it has been worthless and very disappointed with this product and had to pay my insurance a $190  copay. Wow what a bad decision . Wasted money that  I don't have to waste on some designer drug. Definitely will not refill. I'm afraid to take it again, I feel like they are forcing us take a product that does not work . Due to 8 surgeries and Fibromyalgia my life is  tough getting through each day and night. Absolutely no help for sleep . It actually has me waking up ever to hours.

But my excruciating pain was well controlled when I was taking Oxycontin 20 mg am & pm, with 4 tramadols and 4 Percocet 10 mg a day as needed for breakthrough.

I didn't feel well enough to do simple things like go to the grocery store, do dishes, etc. Which the MS Contin allowed me to do.

38,Xtampza ER,Chronic Pain,2.0,,"July 25, 2020",57,I had failed back syndrome and then surgery to fuse my spine from neck to tailbone. Huge surgery that was supposed to help my quality of life. I have more pain after surgery and my mobility is severely limited for life. Before surgery I was on Oxycontin & oxycodone & I could at least have a life.  Then I was switched to Xtampza - this is not working. Politics see me as a drug seeker so I must take the most tamper-proof drug out there whether it relieves pain or not. Xtampza does not. I have gained 15 pounds since starting this med and my quality of life is pitiful. Prescribers are most concerned about MMEs (morphine mg equivalents) and not at all about our ADLs (activities of daily living). It looks like I am taking a huge amount of opioids while I can only absorb a fraction of the med because I cannot force myself to eat enough to get any relief.

I have terrible nightmares, it's terrible on my stomach and I've tried taking it with many different foods and now I have this static sounding noise that is terrible.  I was only given enough for a few weeks to see if it helps but it doesn't and because I don't want to start on Fentanyl I'm going back to what I was taking because this is so much worse and still no pain relief.

43,Xtampza ER,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 29, 2020",93,This Xtampa is totally useless for pain management as it does not work. Rather I feel this drug was created to be big pharma's version of Kratum. In other words it was designed to dock in opioid receptors and stop withdrawal symptoms. But ineffective at removing pain. My personal experience was a  pharmacist putting a bug into my doctors ear and recommending this instead of the oxycodone I am used to taking without any negative side effects. Sadly after taking Xtampza it interacted with some food and it gave me burning diarrhea for 2 days! Not to mention the high frequency hiss in my head that felt like my brain was in the frying pan! I had to call the doctor and explain the reaction and he put through my usual drug and afterwards I went back to my normal self. Now a month later I understand why the recommendation as it costs $800 a bottle and its no wonder I was put through this nightmare for no good reason.,Rambo1

85,Xtampza ER,Chronic Pain,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 4, 2018",34,I just started this after my PM doc said that OxyContin was being targeted by most states. Was on Oxycontin 20 mg for several years..then was put on MS Contin 30 mg for a month which didn't help with pain..but did help me sleep. Now on Xtampza ER 18 mg and it seems to work ok...seems inconsistent though. Some days it works great and other days not so much...almost as if they put placebo pills in with the Xtampa. Going to continue giving this a chance since my insurance seems to approve of it after a doctors exception request. Hopefully it will get better..haven't tried the sprinkling on food yet..but I will try that tonight.,peppergurl33

The Doctor switch me to Xtampza ER 13.5 MG twice a day and I was quite apprehensive after being on Oxycontin for the past few years for an in-operable chronic back condition. I have been very happy with the new medication. It works as well as what I had been taking and it seems to last longer. With Oxycontin I knew when the time was up with this medication I can go two to three hours over the time for the next dose and not have a problem. I also have the feeling that getting off this medication will be easier than getting off the Oxycontin. I know it's basically the same medication but it just seems to work differently.,Jim
