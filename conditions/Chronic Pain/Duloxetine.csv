0,Duloxetine,Chronic Pain,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 19, 2022",0,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):Cymbalta made me really sick when I started taking it. My teeth were grinding, I was always shaking. Constant nausea. After the nausea cleared I retained the other symptoms and they didn't go away until I discontinued use after 5 months. During the 5 months I was on the medication I did have a drop in my pain levels, however I had so many bad side effects I couldn't continue use. I couldn't sleep at all, my sex drive completely went away, and worst of all after years of maintaining a healthy weight I gained over 20 lbs. I was always hungry. I figured the weight gain is making my chronic pain worse and just being masked by the drug. I weaned off of my dosage and have been off of it for over two months now. The worst part is the weight I gained isn't even budging no matter how little I eat. It's like it made me more unhealthy than I was to begin with. Not worth it at all; I can't believe the weight isn't even coming off. The pain is of course back but it's not worth the trade.",Jane

What have I done to my back and body after all these years of duloxetine keeping pain at bay??? I am scared to death.

3,Duloxetine,Chronic Pain,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 21, 2022",2,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):Cymbalta changed me from a happy normal person with interests in everything. One shouldn't expect a normal person to have been sleeping away my days, to for one year I dreamed of every person I had ever known. I had repeated dreams, continuing dreams from one night to another. It definitely upset my sleep cycles. I was constantly sleepy tired and had to lay down at any time of the day to sleep for hours. My body wasn’t tired, my brain was affected. I decided to quit cold Turkey and in about two months I started to return to my old self. Stopping the med did no harm to me.  It did not help that much with pain to take Cymbalta. I started to become interested in daily activities again as I used to be.

My doctor started me on 30 mgs for a week and then told me to go to 60mg if I handled the medicine well. I started taking 60mg and while it helped my migraine some, it didn’t bust them out completely. I’ve taken a few other migraine medications but never liked the drowsiness with them, and I have imitrex for rescue. I took 60 mgs of this medicine for about a month and then put in a refill. My insurance denied it because they’ll only fill 90 day scripts of it now after the initial script. The pharmacy faxed my neurologist twice with NO answer. So I’ve been withdrawing cold turkey off this medicine. I have the worst vertigo, I’m so fatigued.

I cannot take NSAIDs and literally no pain relief from opiates or anything else they could give me. I was pretty desperate and had constant sciatica. My doctor suggested Duloxetine - starting on 20mg once a day. Over 2 months to get to 60mg once a day but once they started working I have gone from a pain level 8-9 down to 2 and under. Sometimes no pain at all! If you go up slowly in dosage the side effects are minimal.

I hated (that's a strong word for me) Cymbalta. I was told I acted like another person while on it and not in a good way. Even though I strictly followed my pharmacist and doctors directions when tapering off if this med, I still had severe withdrawal during and after reducing the mg. I even called the doctor and pharmacy because I was so concerned; I all but went to the emergency room in the beginning stages since I had never had withdrawal symptoms before.",rustyspur

I've gone through multiple specialists, MRIs, physical therapists, chiropractors, and acupuncturists.  Some relief here and there, mostly with acupuncture and specific stretching.  Pain was horrible.  Finally after persistent research, I found what truly works for me:  Cymbalta (normal dose) with daily SAM-E and Malic Acid supplements.  It took about 2 months to fully work, but now I'm virtually PAIN FREE.  Cannot thank God enough for this.",Baloo789

191,Duloxetine,Chronic Pain,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 5, 2013",63,"Cymbalta (duloxetine):I was prescribed Cymbalta for a combination of chronic pain from osteoarthritis and major depressive disorder with melancholia. I started with 30mg for the first two weeks, but had to stop taking my daily 1200 to 1800mg of ibuprofen and also quit drinking. For depression, it was amazing. I felt relief from my despondency within a handful of days, and that has continued through this, my third month. I had my dose increased to 60mg to try and get relief from the chronic pain, but it has not been effective for me in addressing that - thus my rating. For depression, I give it a 10, but for pain (my experience) I have to give it at best, a 3. After consulting with my doctor, he said I could resume taking ibuprofen at a much lower dose.",Marcia64
