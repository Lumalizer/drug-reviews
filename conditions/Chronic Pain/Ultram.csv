0,Ultram,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 27, 2022",0,I suffer from bilateral Trigeminal Neuralgia. This medication does absolutely nothing. It’s not even worth filling the prescription.,JaspersMom
1,Ultram,Chronic Pain,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 30, 2022",0,Tramadol works great for chronic si joint pain. I can actually feel it working and cannot feel where it hurts. I unfortunately cannot be on tramadol long term and need si joint fusion surgery. I’ve had multiple injections in the joint with little to no relief.,IsolatedAnomaly
2,Ultram,Chronic Pain,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 17, 2021",2,"I have been on Tramadol/Ultram for 13 years.  It works on my pain 80% of the time.  However when I added Tizanidine (a muscle relaxer - not to be taken with Tramadol at the same time), I have been mostly pain free.  I take Tizanidine at night for back pain.  It causes drowsiness so do not take during the day.  I take 100mg Tramadol 3x a day for nerve pain.  It works PERFECTLY for me.  Unfortunately I was forced to taper off and get off Tramadol to try Nortripyline which only worked 60% and made me so fatigued I was bed-bound.  Now I am tapering off Nortripyline and going to whatever plan B my neurologist has for me.  My honest opinion - Tramadol works for moderate pain - not severe pain.  I like it because it keeps me comfortable and does not have the loopy side effect of Hydrocodone.  I can function well at least until 5 or 6 p.m. before the nerve pain hits.  This to me is a win.",GettingOutOfHand
3,Ultram,Chronic Pain,10.0,,"February 12, 2021",31,"Ultram has worked well for the multiple chronic pain issues I have and has allowed me to function though the cervical/lumber problems are becoming worse.  If not for Ultram, I would be housebound & unable to move.  Unfortunately, a new doctor without reason reduced the script which has resulted in my pain increasing and being unable to sometimes walk. I did further research and found the DEA final report that clearly states that doctors should not decrease or stop this med for chronic pain.  They were quick to prescribe gabapentin which is one of the worst drugs taken-within 36 hours I had a severe adverse event.  I filed an adverse event complaint with FDA and also had my pharmacy redline the drug so it would not be prescribed again.  Read the information on meds you are taking or a doctor suggests you take before you pay for it.  Sometimes the negative effects are worse than the health problem you have.",Equirdr
4,Ultram,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 18, 2020",55,"I have been one of the many finding myself suffering severe chronic pain, fibromyalgia, cervical radiculopathy, severe osteoarthritis in all my joints and 3 bulging discs. Stripped of all my pain meds and only allowed sporadic usage of ultram. I went from 125mmg fentanyl every 48 hour w/ Vicodin for break through pain to one ultram every 4 to 6 hrs. I might as well be taking a baby aspirin every 4 to 6 hrs.",sam
5,Ultram,Chronic Pain,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 12, 2020",32,I have been on Ultram for 15 years. I started with 150mg a day and l am up to 350mg daily. If l do not take it every 5-6 hours l start feeling sleepy and irritable. Worst of all my pain comes back two fold. I cannot stand up straight due to the severe pain and weakness in both my legs. I had a  lumbar fusion  that has left me with neurological leg weakness and SI joint pain.. l have severe DJD and arthritis.I was recently changed to a generic type of Ultram.  I feel like l am withdrawal all the time .How do l get my pharmacy to replace this generic garbage?,Patricia
6,Ultram,Chronic Pain,10.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"December 29, 2019",39,"Ultram (Brand) has made my life bearable.  I suffer from Fibromyalgia, Osteoarithritis, and Osteoporosis.  I have lessened pain if I take Ultram (Brand). Tramadol, the generic does nothing to lessen the pain.  My Rheumatologist said many of his patients are not helped with Tramadol.  It is not even the same formulation.  Ripoff.",Sarah Shelton
7,Ultram,Chronic Pain,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 13, 2019",24,I was referred to a ‘pain clinic’ for extreme low back/sciatica pain.  I have had hydrocodone for years which I have always used sparingly.  (Due to Florida restrictions on opioids my family doctor was hesitant to give me a narcotic prescription as in the past.)I was prescribed 50mg (2) every 4 hours.I would rate this medicine as 0 for severe pain.  I turned to Extra Strength Aleve which worked better but only slightly diminished my pain.  For me Tramadol is useless.,Fav

10,Ultram,Chronic Pain,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 25, 2018",5,Taken for chronic pain for rheumatoid arthritis. Thought it would help to sleep better as pain wakes me up when changing positions. First two nights miraculous but then started noticing irritability and low mood. Skipped a couple nights and took again. Noticed extreme pain upon rising. Just came from seeing doc advised NOT to take at night he said my body would start craving it and would not realize if I was taking it for RA pain or pain from withdrawal. Hmm. So I am only suppose to take it during day and am no longer suppose to take prednisone as needed.,LiDo
11,Ultram,Chronic Pain,2.0,,"April 8, 2018",9,Absolute nightmare of side effects. I have been on it 21 years and NO ONE will help me get off it. Tried it and it was too hard,Kari
12,Ultram,Chronic Pain,1.0,,"January 28, 2018",6,My Doctor prescribed me this for chronic pain. I tried it 3 weeks in a row and it did nothing for my pain! I was really excited about getting it and trying it and was so disappointed. Though it did help me a couple of time's coming off of stronger prescription painkillers. It was helpful with some of the withdrawal symptoms.,Lymelife
13,Ultram,Chronic Pain,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 1, 2017",13,"I have been on this medication for about 4 years due to Ankylosing spondylitis and I find it pretty effective.  However, I have found that this medication caused unexpected side effects.  It was pointed out to me that shortly after taking a dose, I undertake massive projects that I normally wouldn't, become extremely talkative, insomnia and motivation that wasn't there originally.  I was diagnosed as being bipolar a year ago and these are all symptoms of the ""hypermania"" aspect of Bipolar disorder.  My doctor has found that Ultram put me in a ""manic state"" and when the medication begins to wear off I tend to become anxious and agitated.  There are studies reflecting this online. I would not recommend this medication if you are bipolar.",EMTDad
14,Ultram,Chronic Pain,1.0,,"September 4, 2017",5,"Had bad luck with Ultram and never took this garbage drug again. I have Chronic Spine Pain and 23 Major Spine Surgeries. I have DJD, bilateral, lumbar adhesive arachnoiditis and Neuropathic pain in left leg ( thigh area) with anterior and lateral nerve damage from lumbar Spine surgery. Now have to take Neurontin 400mg capsules for this leg pain. Also, Ultram made me very uncomfortable and did not like the sensation whatsoever. Did not help my Pain at all and side effects make me tell them I am allergic to the drug. I do not want anything that doesn't assist my Chronic Spine Pain! There are plenty of opioids that help me so much better. Just have to work well with my Pain Specialist.",eherzel69
15,Ultram,Chronic Pain,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 5, 2017",43,"I've been living with chronic pain now for over 5 yrs due 2 DJD, Rhuematoid Arthritis, 5 Herniated Discs in my neck, 2 in my Lumbar Spine. I started seeing a Pain Management Neurologist and between Trigger point injections, Prednisone as needed, Tramadol 200mg-400mg a day if needed I was finally able to function again. There wasn't any side effects that occurred while I took it and I found this medication extremely effective. It never removed my pain completely but did allow me to function again. As anyone w/chronic conditions we must learn to live with some pain. There's no natural or man made Opiate in Tramodol but it works similarly as a drug that contains an Opiate. I was on this drug on/off for almost 3 yrs and no addiction issues.",aMgar
16,Ultram,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 28, 2016",39,"After taking 15 mg oxycodone for 3 months for my back pain, Dr. decided to put me on 100 mg of tramodol every 6-8 hours as needed. After taking this medicine for only a week, I find it does Nothing for my pain, not even a little. I find taking this medicine for pain is a waste of money as well as whatever it does to your liver. Whoever approved this drug for pain, has never had to take it for pain. Absolutely worthless.",gkk777

19,Ultram,Chronic Pain,5.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 11, 2016",23,"I took this drug for approximately 2 months and while it helped a bit during the day, the multitude of side effects were much worse! My skin itched so bad I felt like I had bugs, and my joint pain was horrible. I have two herniated discs and I'm in constant pain, but this was definitely not the pain medication for me.",stlrgurl63
20,Ultram,Chronic Pain,1.0,,"December 31, 2015",43,This medication is about as strong as aspirin or ibuprofen. If you take them longer than a few weeks you will also end up with withdrawal worse than any other narcotic pain reliever. It can make you sick to your stomach and if your prescribed too much it can cause severe seizures. If you've never been on any other opiate pain relievers it may work for a bit but I'd use extreme caution in doing so.,justme4631

23,Ultram,Chronic Pain,8.0,,"September 10, 2015",45,"It's a great alternative for people with stomach issues as it causes no GI  upset.  You do have to eat, it can make you nauseous if you don't, but I can't tolerate anti depressant or strong opiates, so this does the trick for moderate chronic pain. Not a good choice for severe pain or post surgery.",Aarcuri
24,Ultram,Chronic Pain,1.0,,"August 10, 2015",35,This did not do anything helpful for me. I tried it for 2 weeks as an opiate substitute after intermedulliary nailing. (This surgery always has a Very painful and long recovery) I was given this by my surgeon because it was supposed to be less addictive. After two weeks I decided to taper off it. This produced HORRID withdrawals.  They were far different and more severe than stopping the opioids which I was over in one day. Don't take this med! If a dr tells you it won't cause withdrawals don't believe it. Opioid worked during my surgical recovery and were no prob to taper off then quit.,1234BoneRepaired
