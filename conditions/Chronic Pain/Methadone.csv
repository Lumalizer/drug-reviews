0,Methadone,Chronic Pain,,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 4, 2022",0,"My pharmacy had run out of the Roxanne brand of methadone. I have been taking methadone for 28 years! 3 months ago they gave me a different brand because they said they could not get the Roxanne's. So I got these T 292 (Camber Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). Other side just a score in half. They suck. I thought I was for real sick with the COVID-19 virus for that length of time. It wasn't that at all. I was just taking enough to keep myself sick, I was wondering why everyday I would throw up bile and my nose would run. Whoever gets that type of methadone, it being your best interest not to get that name brand. Roxanne's are the best. Not bragging, not proud, I'm just telling it the way it is..",Methadone
1,Methadone,Chronic Pain,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 4, 2022",0,"I started Methadone about 10 years ago after Dr's ceased prescribing me OxyContin. I was initially very reluctant to change over but in hindsight it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Methadone works so well for my chronic pain and has allowed me to find a somewhat normal life that involves working in really demanding profession (law). I don't wake up sick and stressing about finding the next opiate tablet, instead, I wake up and still feel comfortable before taking my dose and then not even thinking about opiates until the following morning. I understand that for some the goal is to eventually wean down and cease treatment, but for as far as I can see I don't think I'll ever stop taking it.",Anonymous

I went to the same clinic for 2 1/2+ decades. After being prescribed and taken as prescribed hydrocodone tablets to fentanyl patches were used for part of my treatment. Plus the doctors procedures. I told my PC doctor that the methadone was the one that lasted all day and all night on a 20mg split dose and I could think clearly, work and function normally with little to no pain. MY tolerance did not rise on METHADONE as most of the pain meds I was prescribed .I prefer METHADONE over any med. for pain.",Professor
3,Methadone,Chronic Pain,5.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 28, 2021",0,"I have been treated for chronic back pain for 16 years. 5 bad discs. My doctor tried me on every other type of pain medication before trying Methadone. I was doing very well until 2 things occurred. First, the pharmacy switched me from the round 10mg tablets to the rectangular ones. Then, with the so-called ""opioid epidemic"", our doctors have been running scared with the DEA breathing down their necks. In the last 2 years, my doctor has cut back my dose 3 times, with absolutely NO evidence that I was abusing the medication (which I DO NOT, knowing full well what the consequences of abusing an opiates ARE!) And there was no evidence that I was impaired by the dose I was on! I told the doctor that I was experiencing symptoms of withdrawal on 40 mg. She refused to believe me, at first. Later, she cut my dose back to 30 mg per day, about 2 weeks ago. I now have stomach cramps daily and several other withdrawal symptoms. No pain relief for quite some time. I have to go on Suboxone, now.",Deb G.
4,Methadone,Chronic Pain,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 11, 2021",2,"Methadose (methadone):I have read all the reviews of the methadone medication. The ones that really stand out to me are the people that are taking methadone and say how it saved their life/took all their pain away, and then will say how it rots your brain, or warn you to not take it, etc. If you have a doctor that knows what he is doing, has experience in providing this medication to patients, and YOU follow the doctors' directions about taking the methadone, there shouldn't be a problem at all. It will take your pain away and you will have a life worth living. Now, not all medicines work the same for all people. There are exceptions to EVERYTHING.....in other words, the medication just may not work for you due to your body chemistry. Then, go to your doctor and tell him/her the situation and there is something out there that will help you. You and your doctor just have to find it and sometimes it takes a while. Be patient, you will find it. Yes, I do take methadone. It works very well for me.",one who knows

Then insurance ran out and was put on 360 methadone 10 mg pills per month. I was on that for 12 years then went down to Ten mg 300 a month. Then this sad sorry government got involved. Keep in mind that what was suppose to be care between you and your doctor became a government intervention. Why? Yes I understand that there was abuse always is. However why all of a sudden? I gave this much thought and finally it dawned on me. Money, most of us are on SSD so who was paying for the meds? Of course the federal government. Think about all the billions they saved kicking us off pain control drugs. All you heard for years was OMG opioids  they are so bad for everyone. I think it is Government propaganda. Did they care about us suffering from chronic pain? I don't think so. The government is forcing people to buy street drugs like heroin laced fentanyl. You never hear about those stories.",Anonymous

14,Methadone,Chronic Pain,10.0,,"August 21, 2020",18,"Hello, I have found Methadone to be by far the best solution to long term chronic pain management. I was prescribed everything under the moon for my pain and the problem with all of that is your tolerance keeps growing. Do not let anyone tell you that methadone is not a long acting pain reliever because in fact it is the longest one out there in my opinion. If you truly wish to maintain a somewhat healthy lifestyle and control your pain while being able to function methadone can control your pain and eliminate the constant cravings associated with most opiate pain killers.  It takes a moment to introduce the methadone to your system, a week or two tops. Once it was in my system I literally used to wake up get ready for work and get half way there or so until I remembered I forgot my prescription. I literally continued traveling to work, worked all day and had an ok day. Anyone who is heavily medicated knows that this would never happen with any other medication.",D1STICK45

I was orginally started on a sustained release morphine product and stayed on it for approximately 7-8 years. I was then started on methadone. I cannot remember the dose I was converted to but I was eventually taking 40 mg four times a day. After a few years, I was tapered down to eventually methadone 30 mg three times a day, where I remain to this day. I have found it more effective than either morphine or fentanyl patches. It is particularly effective for the radiculopathy that  I have down the backs of each leg. Unlike morphine, there seems to be much less nausea and vomiting, constipation, and urinary retention. I would also like add that I have not felt an increase in my pain that usually occurred when my next dose of MS Contin was due.",Anonymous

There docs bridged the HM with the MethaDose  (MD) by increasing the MD and decreasing the HM slowly. We went up to 100mg MD and it didn't worked. He lowered it to 10m and still not worked. Somehow, both decided to keep it on 35mg twice (75mg total)a day.

She has gone from 120 to 86 pounds, has chronic stomach pain and is a shell of her former self. Yesterday, we took her to the ER. She was good all day and then they gave her a dose. She was babbling nonsense, had no idea what was going on. For her, this drug is bad news. We are hoping to treat her weight issues, loss of appetite, lose the stomach pain by taking her off this. She will be treated for depression and hopefully, they will find a better way to manage the headaches. Otherwise, we’re watching our mother die a slow death.

Addicts can get what they need but not pain patients. It's sweeping the country and doctors hands are being tied. I go a Hospital in Boston and a doctor lost his license for going above 30mg for one of his patients. I can't go to a methadone clinic because if they find out you are there for pain they will cut you off COLD a turkey and I don't think I could handle that with the amount of pain I am in. The methadone brings my pain down to a 5 which is great but I would love to get down to a 2 or 3. Has anyone experienced this with the new requirements? They will only prescribe opiates that are equivalent to 120 mg of morphine which is bogus.

Yes, my Dr. was aware of this all along the way and would have kept me on it, but I couldn't take it any more. Now, back to more conventional treatment options. I had so hoped the methadone would be the long term answer to my pain and it DID help BUT.",Joe1968

It worked great for me from the start. It is an around the clock relief as long as you find the right dosage. I'm starting to not get the same relief I was and think it's time for a dose change or a possible breakthrough pain medicine needs to be added. I also take Neurontin to help my nerve pain.",chewychew
136,Methadone,Chronic Pain,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"April 3, 2014",55,"Chronic arthritic pain caused me to choose a knee replacement at 51 years old. Sadly, the same leg gained an ankle that is bone on bone due to the gait caused by the bad knee joint. Methadone works best for me with 800mg Ibuprofen. The worst experience with this medication is pharmacy staff. Until they got to know me, of course they assumed I was an addict. Although to be honest, most pain meds cause 2nd class citizen treatment from most medical staff, i.e. phlebotomists, front office staff at doctors office. I like that I can miss 10 or 20 mg of 60 mg/daily dose & not be in unbearable pain or withdrawing from the methadone.",MarcoMe
137,Methadone,Chronic Pain,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"March 15, 2014",72,"Diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis 5 years ago. Tried every narcotic, or non narcotic and never found relief. Naturally became addicted and took a year coming off of 100/micrgr fentenanyl patches. ( 3 every 24/hrs plus oxy 80 as breakthrough ) when I got low enough I took Suboxone to ease my withdrawals. Suboxone worked awesome and I stayed on 20/mg a day for two years, but the analgesic effect of Suboxone is low, and I switched to methadone last August. I love the incredible half life of methadone and its analgesic effects are great for chronic pain. I recommend this to anyone fighting the pain management battle.",Lucke

141,Methadone,Chronic Pain,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 9, 2013",36,"I had high expectations for methadone when I started it. I had to switch from Oxycontin to Methadone because of insurance coverage. It works OK for the pain, but I realized I was so unbelievably tired-with each one I took, and noticed it ""peak"" within 30 min. to an hour. I had NO desire to get out of bed!! It took every bit of my motivation away, gave me an uncomfortable head buzz, and when I went to the DR. a few days later-they said my blood pressure was low-which explained why I felt dizzy, faint, and just plain drained constantly! I have heard it's harder to get off of than oxycodone also. Prescibed for chronic pain, Spinal stenosis, DDD, double laminectomy surgery, constant pain!!",A Chick

146,Methadone,Chronic Pain,10.0,,"August 15, 2013",27,I have bad knees and use an electric chair. The doctor gave me methadone because I asked for it and turned down surgery. I took 10mgs a day--one pill. Not only was it better for pain then anything else I had taken but it helped even more with my depression/suicidal problems. It did not cure suicidal problems but I found myself happy and busy making things. I had to slowly take myself off when I realized I was taking 10 pills. The next time I saw my doctor she saw a very different person..sad and unresponsive. I remained that way for 6 months. I now only take Vicodin & Prozac and am doing well.,venus8i8

I went thru ALL pain meds. Methadone got me to a place I could function and live my life! Without throwing up all the time! I recently was able to slowly decrease the amount because I had gotten so high on the amount. The only downfall, when you have been on it as long as me, is you have to keep upping the amount. I also take Neurontin and that helps so much too! I take many vitamins, started exercising, and lost weight, so I could lower the amount of Methadone. It makes my life bearable.
