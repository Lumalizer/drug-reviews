0,Dilaudid,Chronic Pain,2.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 25, 2021",1,"I have 15 + years of chronic lower back L3 - L5, S.I. Joint & groin pain.I've tried epidurals,  nerve blocks interlaminar & caudal. Some were close but never the right spot.I found oxycodone worked well until my tolerance because too high.I found Dilaudid contin only numbed my brain but did little for pain. The opposite of what I need. Dilaudid affected my memory and left me feeling lethargic most of the time.I know everyone reacts different to each medication.I found oxycodone worked better, faster & with little side effects for back pain. I also could quit oxycodone  quickly & easily.After 2 years on Dilaudid I am weaning myself off it as it did little for sharp lumbar & groin pain. The side effects just compounded the existing problems of living with chronic pain with little to no pain relief.",Alan4821

In the last year I have suffered from Congested Heart Failure,  and just in July I suffered Cardiac Arrest and if not for my friend  knowing CPR I survived.But now I am down to 95 lbs and having a hard time getting fighting back.

I take 4 mgs 5x day and I am not going to be out of pain but it is better than before. Dilaudid is the best way to get my life back on track. I was on oxcodone which is like taking a Tylenol.

5,Dilaudid,Chronic Pain,9.0,,"February 13, 2021",11,"I have been in chronic pain for longer than 25 years,I have been on oxycontin for many years. I have had gastric bypass with a duodenal switch so my absorption rate is rather low. I cannot tolerate morphine sulfate because I need to have a clear head when I work. I switch to Oxycontin, that worked well for some time but the addictive properties were extremely high. I switched to Dilaudid and was extremely happy with the results. I was taking 16 to 20 mg every 4 to 6 hours which is also a truck load. I did not receive any euphoria but it brought my pain level down from a nine to a four which is totally tolerable. I have been in motorcycle accidents and have been shot I understand what a level 10 pain is. I highly recommend trying this medication if you had had problems with fogginess lightheadedness. It really depends what your goal is, mine is quality of life and the ability to work, have sex, ride my motorcycle, and to maintain some semblance of joy in life.",Boomer

7,Dilaudid,Chronic Pain,10.0,,"September 24, 2020",19,"I was diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis 11 months ago so suffered with bad pain. During my 3 months in the hospital I received Dilaudid in IV the first month 4mg at first then gradually down to 2mg. Next Dilaudid by pill form 4mg every 4 hours down to 2 every 4 hours through the 2nd month. The 3rd month 2 mg every 6 hours which barely cut the intensity of the nerve pain caused by this gawd-awful disease. Once released from the hospital in I was Rx'd hydrocodone 5-325. Now this is in addition to gabapentin, lyrica, Cymbalta, xanax, etc. By May I began to have what's referred to as ""saddle burn."" The burn was more like blazing! I went to ER and was admitted and given Dilaudid again as before through my IV. I cried I was so relieved. But you can't stay in the hospital on an IV permanently and Dilaudid is not prescribed as outpatient. So suffering is my daily routine whether I exercise, push my walker a good 3/4 mile a day, go to pool PT, cry, get in my truck and scream ""FATHER why hast thou forsaken me!?""Dilaudid works.",Nan

I have bone spurs pushing into my spinal cord. Because of this I get debilitating spinal headaches. Since the new guidelines on the amount of drugs that can be prescribed, I am never out of pain.

IV administration quickly relieved my pain. I describe the feeling as melting into the bed in a feeling of euphoria. I was told by hospital staff it was 8 x stronger than morphine.

Without blood, the bone tissue dies and the bone collapses. Treatment is total hip replacement. I have had my right done. It was collapsed. Very painful! Now waiting on my left. That is not the end.

56,Dilaudid,Chronic Pain,,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 14, 2013",87,"Dilaudid keeps me wide awake. I take 4 mg for failed back surgery. It does take the edge off, but doesn't take away 1/2 of the pain. For the life of me, I cannot understand why it keeps me wide awake. I took one pill at 4:30pm yesterday and last I looked at my clock last night, it was 4:33am.",Greta-Jane
57,Dilaudid,Chronic Pain,9.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 28, 2013",107,"Really helps ease the breakthrough pain. I was afraid when I first started it that it wouldn't help much at all, but in truth it works better than anything else that I have been prescribed. I have had one surgery for three herniated discs of my cervical spine and now have two more that need surgery at waist level. I have been suffering, only existing. Not living for more than ten years. Dilaudid gave me back some of my life and it doesn't make me nauseous like many of the other medications that I have been on. Even though it doesn't take away all of the pain it does make it much more tolerable. Morphine made me sick and I was severely hyper sensitive to it.  I am thankful for the relief Dilaudid has given me.",chronicpain2013
58,Dilaudid,Chronic Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 17, 2013",85,"I've been diagnosed with rhabdomiolitis. The pain it brought was excruciating - 15 on a scale of 1 to 10.The rheumatologist ordered an initial dose of 4 mg by IV (this is an unusually high dose, the pharmacy double checked with the doctor before releasing the medicine). Subsequent doses were only 2 mg.Dilaudid took away ALL of my pain within 60 seconds. The relief lasted through the night, allowing me a full night of sleep. Hydromorphone, the tablet form, is far less effective than I.V. In fact, I was down right disappointed with the tablets. They seemed to do nothing at all for the pain. It's hard to believe that hydromorphone tablets and Dilaudid I.V. are the same medicine.I will request for my doctor to prescribe the Dilaudid injections.",Jonsonroc
59,Dilaudid,Chronic Pain,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"May 14, 2013",156,"I just started taking Dilaudid a short time ago. I have lived in misery for the last 12 years with lower and upper back pain. I have been on MS Contin. Vicodin, Lortab pill and liquid.  I recently hurt my back at work to the point that, I could not even drive. My doctor put me on Dilaudid and I have to say that it works well.  I feel for anyone who lives with chronic pain.  At least I can move and work. Maybe not as fast as I once was but, I still get the job done. Please don't give up there are other alternatives that may work for you.",Larry Woodcock

Dilaudid is only thing that works. I think it should be used more often. Morphine at ER Would take 4 shots and nausea and bad for MY ailments. 10/10 EVERY TIME! Thanks,Kelrod81
67,Dilaudid,Chronic Pain,9.0,,"September 26, 2012",157,"I have severe chronic abdominal pain and the only medication that controls my pain is Dilaudid. I was first given Dilaudid IV in the hospital after I had a reaction to morphine and it was AMAZING. In less than a minute my pain was essentially gone.  The IV Dilaudid is, in my opinion, the greatest medicine ever invented. I now take 4 mg tablets six times a day for my pain and it keeps my pain at about a 4, as opposed to being 9 or 10 without it. I have a really sensitive stomach but I don't get nauseated from it like I do with other pain meds. ",huntsketchup
