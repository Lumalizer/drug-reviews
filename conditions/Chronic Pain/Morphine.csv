I will be going back to previous pharmacy which carries different manufacturer. The Ranbaxy/Sun 15 mg ER tablets are inconsistent.

Something is really wrong with this extended relief medication. Will let CVS know this medication needs further review.

Ended up on Oxycontin and Oxynorm for permanent slipped disc, which just spaced me out, worked miracles on my back, but I was just high all the time, so weaned myself off. Ended up taking Oromorph and MST  for 10yrs, and it rotted my teeth. If I could go back in time, I would have not even started on it if I knew I would lose my teeth!!! I had lovely teeth and spent 3 years with specialist dentist trying to save them but the Oromorph had already done the damage. I looked after my teeth and I am devastated to have a false top denture, but my mouth's SO DRY from all my medication that it can't cope with a bottom set.

Sorry! Dr's can prescribe as much pain meds as they see fit. Unfortunately like many doctors, nurses, etc., out there, they didn't read, or understand, the bulletin that the DEA sent them. Their recommendation were ""not more than 90 mgs per day"" except for those with severe chronic pain, not just cancer patients (which by the way almost any cancer out there DOESN'T cause pain, it's a false claim! Only a couple types of cancer actually cause pain). Believe me... When my doctor tried to lower my dose, I went straight to the DEA!

Although dependency on pain medication has it's own problems, I still think it was a good choice. I have had almost 20 productive years that I would not otherwise have had. I have learned two things in those years. First, if you are taking Morphine ER, try to arrange your schedule in such a way that you have an hour or two to nap after you take your meds. This medication is more effective if you are sleeping or at rest as it takes effect. Second, avoid oxycodone or oxycontin [time-release oxycodone]. That medication rapidly looses effectiveness and becomes unreliable. For me, the best overall pain med has been Morphine ER.Hope this helps, and God bless.",Don't be Afraid!

Some would say the upside through your IV, is the instant relief (in the ER, that's the point),but the duration of relief (some say),is shorter than that of the pills, which by design are rated to last 12 hrs. The info along w/the script says the coating is there because it's an extended-release tablet, hence the 12hr rating for pain relief.

It was from a combination of several surgeries, GI issues, endometriosis, bleeding ovarian cysts etc. I am going to be 30 this year and the condition has robbed me of most of my twenties. For years I have tried Percocet, Dilaudid, Lortab, oxycodone, dihydrocodeine, injections in my nerves, Lyrica, topimarate. They only work for a short time and then I have to pretty much live my life around my pain medicine schedule. Then after my last 2 surgeries, the pain got better and was slightly okay with Lortab but not good enough. I started MS Contin 15mg twice a day last week and I have been virtually pain free.
