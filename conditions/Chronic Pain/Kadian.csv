0,Kadian,Chronic Pain,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 21, 2018",32,"After trying Percocet, OxyContin and several other types of pain medication my doctor prescribed me Kadian and by far this is the best medication I have ever used for my chronic pain from Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis. I am on the low dose 10mg and it has outperformed the 40mg OxyContin I was on.",Rez40
1,Kadian,Chronic Pain,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 7, 2017",7,"I have been using Kadian for at least 9 years now.  I haven't ever had the need to increase dosage, unlike Oxy etc.My pharmacy wholesaler stopped carrying Kadian a few months ago and I have been sick ever since.  Headaches, loose bowels and G.I. distress.  I am searching for Kadian without much luck.",Jimmer 97
2,Kadian,Chronic Pain,8.0,,"April 5, 2017",21,"Kadian has been an amazinglyâ€‹ helpful medication for me. I take 14 medications daily, four of those medications are for severe pain. And until the doctor added Kadian the pain just was not giving me any breaks. I have been on Kadian for about four years now I would rather die than miss even one dose as it's that important to the quality of my life. To be fair I do have some side effects I consider to be mild and not worth even mentioning one thing to say that is important I am physically addicted to this medicine missing a dose makes me sick sick sick but then again I don't miss doses anyway because of my pain levels however the pharmacy doc or insurance will mess up once in awhile so I do suffer missing doses once in awhile",Jsam50
3,Kadian,Chronic Pain,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 11, 2017",30,"Kadian is AMAZING! I've been a pain sufferer for decades. I suffer from spinal stenosis/spindylosis; cervical neuralgia, etc. I've had multiple cervical fusions (anterior & posterior) with hardware. Anyone who's been through multiple fusions knows the pain changes, but never truly goes away. Pain was somewhat manageable with MS Contin, but I would still ""pay"" for it if I ever pushed myself, traveled, etc. Since 1998, I never had more than a week or two between moderate/severe pain flare-ups. Since kadian, I've gone as long as 3 months without one! I even flew to Europe for a 10 day vacation (which was a ton of walking/sitting) without any issues! Kadian works and works AWESOME!",sas1217
4,Kadian,Chronic Pain,9.0,,"November 20, 2016",41,I have been using Kadian for about 5 years and it has kept my pain at bay.  I was recently switched to Morphine and the pain that drives me crazy came back well before I could take another pill (8 hr). I found this intolerable and went back to the Kadian.  As of Jan. of 2017 the only thing my doctor says I will be able to get is EMBEDA.  I have not tried it yet but was denied coverage by my insurance.  The DEA should not interfere with patients getting their proper medication!,TTwotone
5,Kadian,Chronic Pain,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 4, 2016",10,"I started taking Kadian for a couple of days then swapped back to my ms-contin until my next drs .visit to see what we need to do about the dosage .I started with the 10mg-ER which was good through the day but had 'the jitters' most of the time which I didn't like then it only lasted for maybe 10 hours & then started to detox & was awake the biggest part of the night until I was so tired I fell asleep around 4 a.m.The next day I took it again about 8 a.m.then took a second dose around 7 p.m. then stayed awake all night with 'the jitters' until 5 a.m.  So I changed back to my 30mg ms-contin until I can see my dr. Needless to say, I wasn't very happy with the change so I'm hoping for something better or I'll just have to pay $80 a month for the ms-contin",Lilah M.

7,Kadian,Chronic Pain,10.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 15, 2015",23,"Kadian is a life saver when I have ""break-through"" pain.I use to take it every day, but the pain clinic I went to, was adding too many meds, we had an argument, and I left.My primary care doctor, knowing I have 4 fused cervical discs with the titanium plate, is still ""afraid"" to prescribe. We agreed on 20mgs of oxycodone BID, down from 30mgs TID.I have suffered for a 16 months, and many more visits to my osteopath, who is so gifted. He ""GETS IT"", and thinks no doctor, should judge my situation, and make me feel like an addict.I am going to request, he re-prescribe 60mg of KADIAN, for ""break-through"" pain. Last week (1) 60mg Kadian, STOPPED my spine pain, 100%. Glad I saved (8) from 2 years ago. THANK YOU KADIAN~",RootsGal

13,Kadian,Chronic Pain,9.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"April 1, 2013",43,I was on Kadian for a few years and this medicine worked well for me. If the doctors prescribe it the right way (increasing the dosage every month or so) then it can be a very effective medicine. Sadly after several years I was switched to Opana.,tammymelton
