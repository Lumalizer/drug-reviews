1,Fentanyl,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 20, 2021",1,Fentanyl Transdermal System (fentanyl):I found that for whatever reason it had little to no effect on my pain I had previously been on morphine for over a decade but VA decided this would be better. I had previously tried it about 15 years ago and had the same reaction I don’t know why but patches don’t work for me,VA patient
2,Fentanyl,Chronic Pain,,Taken for 10 years or more,"October 2, 2021",1,"Used for 15 years off and on and they are the best I have used for chronic pain.  I have to do the 75 mcg every 48 hours and tabs for break through pain and this works best for me.  I used the name brand but now they have stop making them and I  can not find any of the others to come close to them, so now can not do anything like I could with the name brand, so some thing is different. They said it’s just in my head but either way the other’s don’t work as good",Brown

4,Fentanyl,Chronic Pain,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"September 21, 2021",1,I have several diseases such as califilaxis that cause severe pain. I have been guinea pigged. From Norco Percocet oxycontin oxycodone oxymorphone and fentanyl. I find that fentanyl is the most effective. The new patches are not effective at all.

5,Fentanyl,Chronic Pain,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 7, 2021",2,Fentanyl Transdermal System (fentanyl):I've been on fentanyl for around 15 yrs. I started @ 25mcg every 72 but had to move up quickly. I have DDD. My L4/5 has been fused. I just found out my S1-L3 now need fused. I have a spinal cord stimulator that did not help & now does not work. I have severe pain in my hips. My legs give out on me regularly. I'm now @ 100 mcg every 24 hrs. I also have chronic SEVERE migraines & Narcolepsy so I'm a bucket O' fun. I can't stand nor sit for long. Cold weather is so hard on  me. I have to be on my back laying on heat for ANY type of relief. I went through the pill regiment but didn't like being off my rocker and taking 2 every 4 hours. My doctor suggested I take a blood test that actually let's you know what's metabolizes better in your body. Funny thing was every thing I'm on now is perfect. Pills metabolize too quickly in my system. Thankfully I have no copay for my fentanyl. I do hope to be off all meds at some point though.,Lacie Garcia

It took me over 18 months to come down off of it. Every few days I would cut the patch smaller and smaller! I would never recommend this medication to anyone! My doctor at that time had me on the fentanyl pops at the same time! Also at the same time I was on OxyContin and regretfully lost all of my teeth due to the combination and strength of those drugs!I learned a huge lesson about doctors and narcotics!

He has me pre-approved for a higher dose I've had to go from 175mg/hr to 112mg/hr and norco for breakthrough pain but now because it takes 2 patches to get to that dose the guidelines only want me to be on 1 patch so they want me to go down to just the 100mg/hr...ANYONE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS?? My kidneys can't take more pills/meds. I have 4 different and very rare diseases that cause very extreme pain of which there is no cure. If we all got together and wrote a letter with as many other people who have the same problems maybe we could make a difference. I can't function without pain management.

My next issue is that I am running out of usable places I can reach and keep track of the patch while wearing it, because they are irritating my skin.

Can’t say enough positive things about the quality of life I have now. Yes, I still have bouts of breakthrough pain, but no longer take it as often. Also nice not to have to worry about do I have my meds? When leaving the house for work as one patch changed every 72 hours. Boom. Done.

It has worked great for me BUT I just talked with Jansen Pharma that makes it and was told the reason my pharmacist has had a hard time getting any is because they (Jansen) have stopped making it!

Imagine my shock to lose the 1 medication that enabled me to live a somewhat normal life. I have been in chronic pain since a car accident in 2001.  I had tried every fentanyl manufacturer after Sandoz stopped production on their patch & Duragesic was the only one that I could use without horrible side effects. Now, I’m on morphine & it barely takes the edge off of my pain. I’ve called J&J, spoke to different departments, inquired as to why they chose to stop producing this drug, & have gotten nowhere. I even asked if they ever considered the patients that depended on their patch for pain relief. One woman told me there are other brands available & hung up on me. Another sent forms to complete. My intention is to relate that my adverse reaction is the pure anger I have for them not considering how many people there are in chronic pain that their decision affected.",Geri

14,Fentanyl,Chronic Pain,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 18, 2020",43,I have been using name brand fentanyl patches 100mcg (Duragesic) for 12 years. I have a special authorization so my insurance company will pay for them because of allergy issues. Last month I find out that Johnson & Johnson stopped making them. Wow now I have to use a generic for the first time in 12 years. I end up getting Apotex brand. OMG they won't stick so I had to tape them on. I don't think they have any fentanyl in them at all. My pain was so bad my Doctor rewrote my prescription so I could get another brand. What does my pharmacy do drops me as a patient and refuses to ever fill my prescriptions again. Even though I was going to give back the Apotex brand to fill new ones. My Doctor was even stunned by their reaction cause I'm not a patient that has issues : my pain is a 4-5 normally to now an 8-9. Obviously something is seriously wrong. This month I ordered Mylan through a new pharmacy and my pain is much better. Apotex brand should be taken off the market.,Sweetpea

There is absolutely NO MEDICATION in these!! I don't know why or how Apotex is getting away with this but I think I am going to contact the FDA and others to let someone in AUTHORITY look into it!! Do yourself a big favor and if you are ever offered this so called drug, REJECT IT!!! If you accept it, then you will be sitting in AGONY for a month like I am right now!! APOTEX SUCKS!!

16,Fentanyl,Chronic Pain,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 16, 2020",80,Fentanyl Transdermal System (fentanyl):I have a lot of experience with fentanyl patches they have always worked now I've been switched to a different brand due to lack of insurance I had to drop the price never before has a brand not worked. Now this particular brand not only does it not work it doesn't do anything at all with all the equivalent testing how is this possible. Although I would never accuse someone of this especially a drug company it's almost like there is no fentanyl on the patch at all. What's even crazier is that the particular patch that doesn't work claims to have bio equivalence testing and that they're just as good as the brand name and I  have personally used one or two generic companies that are they the best I have I ever used. This is a drug that gives people quality of life and without it they may as well give up. Fentanyl Transdermal System drug used properly is one of the best that has ever been made and now they are making generic so cheap that I'm not even sure that the drug is actually on the patch that is very scary,Moonpie

I’m a car salesman and it literally makes my life worth living. I can love  my family and work 70 hour weeks selling cars. As far as brands of fentayl go the Mylan by far is the best second is probably Alvogen. Apotex is the worst by far. Mine typically only work for like 50 hours or so.

I was on Fentanyl patches and, given all of the political controversy surrounding the drug, I decided to come off of it and use Hydrocodone for pain control.  The supply in drug stores was being rationed by their distributors, and I couldn't count on my required dosage always being available.  The drug has become a political football in the state where I live.  I came off of Fentanyl in stages, dropping the dose each time by 50%--and at each transition experienced withdrawal symptoms.  In retrospect, Fentanyl was very effective in pain control.  The alternatives at this point are meditation, exercise, injections, RF probes, and lesser drugs--all of which I'm familiar with.  Interestingly, when I inquired of my physician as to the use of cannabis-based approaches, I was advised that I would be dropped from his care after two months if I chose to pursue this alternative.",beto
