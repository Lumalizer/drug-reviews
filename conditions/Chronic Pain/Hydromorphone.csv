0,Hydromorphone,Chronic Pain,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 31, 2021",0,"I'm a woman in my early 40's and was rear ended twice. First accident caused 5 back surgeries in L5-S1 and second caused a multi level fusion in C4-C6 with a herniated disc in C3-C4.  I now have a bone spur at the bottom of C6 with arthritis and inflammation in C7-T1.  Also get migraines, have post concussion syndrome, failed back syndrome, I have fibromyalgia, sciatica, stenosis, PTSD, radiculopathy and many more.  I started with 10 my OxyContin twice daily and 10/325 Percocet 3-4 times daily.   I had a massive flare up and hydromorphone IV worked like nothing I've ever had before.  I asked my pain management dr to switch me.  I started on 2mg now I'm up to 8mg 3-4 times daily.  It takes about 20 minutes and wipes my pain away. I'm also on 30 mg of Oxycontin every 8 hours (90 mg daily). Recently the doctor tried having me wean a little bit down and the weather is so cold that I flared right back up.  8 mg of hydromorphone has been working for me and is a miracle drug.",Pianogal
1,Hydromorphone,Chronic Pain,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 20, 2021",0,"DO NOT let your pharmacist fill your Rx with any Rhodes pharmaceuticals products! They simply don't work, or at best work only about 10 to 25% of what they should. I have dealt with this issue with their generic Percocets for years.  Now they have broaden their perspective to include inferior Hydromorphone, aka Dilaudid.  I'm disgusted because now I am stuck with a months worth of this pseudo drug that doesn't ease my pain!  Beware!  Read the reviews on their website and you will see I am correct.   I guess they are the cheapest generic and thats why pharmacies are switching to them. Try to get Mallinckrodt or Actavis....these Rx companies have been around for decades and make more trustworthy products.  Good Luck... and tell your Doctor if you have similar problems with Rhodes Rx.  There is no excuse for this, and their negligence for $ should be addressed by authorities.",Don

Some were close but never the right spot.I found oxycodone worked well until my tolerance because too high.I found Dilaudid contin only numbed my brain but did little for pain. The opposite of what I need. Dilaudid affected my memory and left me feeling lethargic most of the time.I know everyone reacts different to each medication.I found oxycodone worked better, faster & with little side effects for back pain. I also could quit oxycodone  quickly & easily.After 2 years on Dilaudid I am weaning myself off it as it did little for sharp lumbar & groin pain. The side effects just compounded the existing problems of living with chronic pain with little to no pain relief.",Alan4821

I have had gastric bypass with a duodenal switch so my absorption rate is rather low. I cannot tolerate morphine sulfate because I need to have a clear head when I work. I switch to Oxycontin, that worked well for some time but the addictive properties were extremely high. I switched to Dilaudid and was extremely happy with the results. I was taking 16 to 20 mg every 4 to 6 hours which is also a truck load. I did not receive any euphoria but it brought my pain level down from a nine to a four which is totally tolerable. I have been in motorcycle accidents and have been shot I understand what a level 10 pain is. I highly recommend trying this medication if you had had problems with fogginess lightheadedness. It really depends what your goal is, mine is quality of life and the ability to work, have sex, ride my motorcycle, and to maintain some semblance of joy in life.",Boomer

During my 3 months in the hospital I received Dilaudid in IV the first month 4mg at first then gradually down to 2mg. Next Dilaudid by pill form 4mg every 4 hours down to 2 every 4 hours through the 2nd month. The 3rd month 2 mg every 6 hours which barely cut the intensity of the nerve pain caused by this gawd-awful disease. Once released from the hospital in I was Rx'd hydrocodone 5-325. Now this is in addition to gabapentin, lyrica, Cymbalta, xanax, etc. By May I began to have what's referred to as ""saddle burn."" The burn was more like blazing! I went to ER and was admitted and given Dilaudid again as before through my IV. I cried I was so relieved. But you can't stay in the hospital on an IV permanently and Dilaudid is not prescribed as outpatient. So suffering is my daily routine whether I exercise, push my walker a good 3/4 mile a day, go to pool PT, cry, get in my truck and scream ""FATHER why hast thou forsaken me!?""Dilaudid works.",Nan

As for the generics (2/10) made by apotex they are not good for pain relief and they end up giving me a migraine and make me extremely tired. I do not know what the chemical differences are between the name brand and the generics are but there is something that is drastically reducing the effectiveness of the hydromorph. Unfortunately the generics are the only option to be covered by any government insurance. I will be paying the difference to get the name brand from this point on.

My pain management doctor had me on 60 mg of Oxycontin 3 X daily and it worked (somewhat) for a while until I developed a tolerance and it too became ineffective.  So the doctor switched me to 16 mg. Exalgo 2 X daily.  I was resistant at first, mainly because of reducing the number of doses per day but after I took it for a few days I was amazed.
