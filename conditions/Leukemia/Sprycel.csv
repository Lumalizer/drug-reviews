0,Sprycel,Leukemia,1,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 15, 2017",4,"Having tried bith Imatinib and Nilotinib, my Haemotologist tried me on Dasatinib - the effect this drug had on me was devastating, after only 3 days my body literally began to shut down, I was so weak I was crawling on my hands and knees just to go to the bathroom. After two weeks off it was decided to try a greatly reduced dosage (50mg) every other day but even at that I had little to no quality of life. I hope others have had better luck than I did.",ulstersam
