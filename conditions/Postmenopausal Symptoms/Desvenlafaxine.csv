1,Desvenlafaxine,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 23, 2018",9,I was put on the generic for menopausal symptoms. Hot flashes flashes irritability depression anxiety. It took right at 4 weeks (30 days) to work.  I was about to give up. Because the Brand worked better and I was on it 3 years ago. I'm on  50mgs and feel great. Only side affect I had was no appetite and had lots of energy. So I take it in the morning. Brand worked faster to me and generic took right at 4 weeks.,CJ Georgia
2,Desvenlafaxine,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 31, 2012",32,"Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):About three weeks ago, I began having around 20 hot flashes per day and going through night sweats about 4 times per night. About 5 days ago my doctor put me on Pristiq. He did this as my Father recently passed away and several other personal things have happened and I didn't start my period this month either. He said it would take care of the night sweats, hot flashes and depression, grief and anxiety. I have been on this pill for 5 days now. I have lost four lbs., have gone from a pk. of cigarettes per day to four cigarettes. Am only getting night sweats about twice a night and have gone from about 21 hot flashes per day to about 4. So far so good. I do feel a little tired but no agitation, no more confusion, crying and emptiness. I feel like I am slowly getting back to being me. So far, I am so thankful for Pristiq.

3,Desvenlafaxine,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10,,"November 13, 2011",16,"Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):I have been on Pristiq for 3 months. Before this time, I have been having severe bouts of rage and anger due to PMS. For 2 weeks a month, I was not able to control myself. On this medicine I am under full control! No more screaming or fits of rage. No more shaking from such anxiety. I am on 50 mg. I would highly recommend this medicine. My only side effect is weight gain. I have gained 15 pounds. I'm dieting and exercising to combat this affect. I'm not going off this medicine for that reason. It's the only one that has worked for me.",Pristiq776
