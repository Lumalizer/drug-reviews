0,Junel,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"June 14, 2021",5,"This has helped a ton with fatigue, mood swings and hot flashes. Hasnâ€™t caused weight gain. It has worked a lot better than the estrogen only replacement therapy that I was previously on. I highly recommend trying for peri menopause symptoms or menopause symptoms.",Bellamy4201
1,Junel,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10.0,,"December 7, 2020",3,"I was very sick after I went thru menopause, I became very sick for 3 years. I kept seeing all different doctors but none of them can help me. I got tiredness, short of breath, anxiety, dizziness, fainting, vomiting. After I tried smaller dose first up to nearly 2 months it worked. My driving became confident again and I got my energy back too. My doctor increased 1 mg to 2 mg doses. He thought I should took this medicine rather than those anxiety medicine, as many specialists recommended and should take it at least 30 years so it can support my bones too. After 6 weeks in total my confident went up to 40% .Now I still keeping taking it. I am very happy with it even though my weigh gain a bit but at least my anxieties are lesser. My sleeping getting better too. So I thought maybe I can help those people who went through menopause like me but never know that this Hormone Replacement medicine can help menopause and premenopause and anxiety too . Give it a go .",La
2,Junel,Postmenopausal Symptoms,2.0,,"September 24, 2016",4,"I started Lo Loestrin Fe and on my first pack. Two weeks into the pack, my period started. The bleeding has been nonstop for one week. I haven't even started the white pills yet, and I am concerned that this bleeding will keep going as it hasn't lightened up at all. Trying to be patient and wait out this first month to see what happens before contacting my doctor. I am 52, and I've been put on this to level out the hormonal mood shifts and heavy periods while in this perimenopause stage of life. The Fe did provide an energy boost for me as I was slightly low in iron to begin with. Ironically, this mid-pack period has started and I am feeling tired and have daily headaches. Anyone else with similar situation? Pregnancy is non-issue.",Support needed
3,Junel,Postmenopausal Symptoms,2.0,,"September 19, 2015",4,"I'm 52 and still get my period every month. I was put on Lo Loestrin FE for peri-menopausal symptoms that were mostly related to digestive issues. Within 5 days of being on this pill, my digestive issues disappeared and my skin started to feel thicker. I was thrilled! By day 10, I started to feel a little itchy all over, but dismissed it thinking it was due to the hormones making my skin thicker. Unfortunately, the itching sensation became more intense and my face became severely dry with what looked like the start of eczema on my forehead. At this point I was on day 5 of the second month and I couldn't take it anymore. I called my doctor and she switched me over to Mircette. The itching stopped when I stopped the Lo Loestrin FE",LaurieDP

Also having a thyroid autoimmune disease, menopause was worse for me, a bad endocrine ""cocktail"" as it were, and I was for almost a year brought to my knees with 20 or more knee buckling hot flash episodes a day that caused so much joint and limb pain I couldn't walk, severe depression, was nearly bedridden from lack of energy and episodes that were almost anxiety attacks (never had them before).  Within 3 weeks of taking FemHrt, it nearly all ceased.  I got my life back.",Anonymous
