0,Paroxetine,Postmenopausal Symptoms,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 13, 2020",10,"Paxil (paroxetine):I was given Paxil 20 mg for night sweats at bedtime by my OBGYN after my hysterectomy.  My medical doctor increased it to 40 mg about a year ago because I had been experiencing more night sweats.   Taking Paxil was the worst thing for me.  I was so depressed I am surprised I’m still here.  My doctor weaned me off of it in about 2 weeks.  It should be completely out of my system in about another week or two.  I already feel like a new person.  I wake up happy, I’m finally putting myself first, I stay happy.  My sleep is better.  I don’t take anything now.  If I start having them after not taking the Paxil I will live with them.  I will never be put on anything like this again.  It was so bad! To think I thought I was taking this pill for  night sweats and didn’t even know it was an antidepressant until  my daughter told me a few weeks back.",Anonymous

2,Paroxetine,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 6, 2018",24,"Paxil (paroxetine):I have been on 10 mg of the generic of Paxil for post menopausal symptoms for 2 months and I have noticed significant improvement in my conditions. My sex drive as of today, is not effected, however it takes more time to reach orgasm. I've stopped stressing out severely and only have controlled concern over what I would have considered upsetting matters. My anxiety/panic attacks used to last for days and I felt as if I lost myself....Those horrible feelings are now gone. My hot flashes have lessened and I sleep much better. My personality has not changed in a negative way, in fact, I am more pleasant to be around. I used to yell at my kids and husband every weekend, so I'm thinking I should have started taking this medicine a long time ago",JuliannaO
3,Paroxetine,Postmenopausal Symptoms,9.0,,"February 3, 2018",17,"Paxil (paroxetine):Was prescribed Paxil for postmenopausal hot flashes and anxiety. Though it did not completely stop all my hot flashes, it greatly reduced them, making my life bearable. I also have had a lot of anxiety/ social and generalized. Being on this drug, I notice that I have much less anxiety. Overall, I have felt much better on Paxil and have had no troublesome side effects, knock wood.",Jgfb

5,Paroxetine,Postmenopausal Symptoms,,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"October 14, 2017",9,"Paxil (paroxetine):In July 2011 I had a complete hysterectomy, throwing me into spontaneous menopause.  The hot flashes and night sweats were excruciating but, hormones of any kind made me completely crazy.  I was so happy when I discovered Paxil.  I started out on the lowest dose which has been increased over the years yo 60 mg a day.  Three and a half weeks ago I called in for a refill but I didn't have any left.  It took me three weeks to get in to see my doctor.  I refused to go back on it because of the withdrawals I am still experiencing.  First, all I did was sleep.  Then, I started experiencing severe joint pain.  After three weeks, I am starting to feel slightly better.  I now just feel like I have the worst case of the flu and arthritis.",Excruciating withdrawals
6,Paroxetine,Postmenopausal Symptoms,,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 29, 2017",9,Paxil (paroxetine):I was on Prempro for 30 years after menopause at 40. Dr said get off it so 4 years ago weaned off it and the hot flashes started and have continued for 4 years. Now my new doctor recommended Paxil 10 mg and it has really helped me. I never was depressed but anxious and it seemed to bring on the heat.,Little Billie
7,Paroxetine,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 23, 2017",5,"I have been off and on this for over ten years. I will go years taking it  and then go through the long weaning off period go about six months symptom free, then it starts all over after doing this 3 times I have resolved myself to my doctors advice to stay on it till I am done with menopause. No complaints though it has been a great keeps me at my normal self I just hate taking any Medication.So don't suffer really it is not something you can control.It is a true chemical imbalance and Paxil rebalances you. it does take a few weeks when you begin. I did have terrible dry mouth and zero appetite for a month but then everything adjusted and it has been a blessing. You are never alone reach out get help and GOD bless  <3",Anonymous
