0,Premarin,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 22, 2022",0,"I suffered from horrible night sweats, flashes all day long and a mean foul temper due to lack of restful sleep and lack of estrogen apparently.  Had a partial hysterectomy at 44, started HRT at 50.  Finally found a doctor who didn't just give me a pat on the arm and an antidepressant.  Started with premarin and found myself.  Sleep was restful, I could tolerate people and even enjoy them, my husband no longer was at risk of being the target of tears, anger, resentment, sadness, and happiness all in the matter of minutes...then my insurance said it was no longer covered.  Tried a few other ""covered"" options and have been MISERABLE!  The Flashes and night sweats are even worse.  Wishing there was a synthetic form of this, hoping for a generic that works BUT have not been successful seriously trying to figure out how to make $500 a month to be able to stay on it and have quality of life.",DanDe
1,Premarin,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10.0,,"April 5, 2021",15,"Best for me. Tried all of HRTs, estrace pills, patches, pellets, injections and premarin works best tho not cheap. Premarin pills 1.25mg 2/day plus Premarin cream 1 gram daily plus low dose progesterone (2.5mg) the only solution for me. Had endometrial ablation years ago and don't need progest but found tiny dose helps the prem work better. If you have trouble means either the dose, brand or delivery is not correct for your chemistry. The progesterone most MDs rx is Prometrium 100mg, only during pregnancy does a woman's body ever make that high a level! Pre-meno non preg women only produce ~25-30mg progesterone daily and ~1.5-9.0 mg estrogen daily. Progesterone can convert into estrogen which can help meno symptoms but it doesn't convert in all women the same. Prometrium was much too high for me (gave me bad symptoms) I needed less progesterone and higher estrogen to feel balanced. Watch youtube videos of Menopause Taylor (Dr. Barbara Taylor) she explains everything.",Jah1016
2,Premarin,Postmenopausal Symptoms,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 24, 2021",0,"I began Premarin cream a month ago, using a pea size amount twice weekly.  It does help with peri-menopause symptoms.  My estrogen got very low, I ended up with prolapses, dryness, sweating, melasma, facial hair, acne, water retention and mood swings. So, I was given the cream to help with burning and prolapse.  My concern is that I still have regular menstruation and no progesterone was given to me with this.  The sweats and burning are improving, but ALL other symptoms are worse!  Especially acne.  I’m wondering if it’s estrogen dominance, even though the estrogen is low, but the doctors dismiss these concerns and nobody will repair the class three prolapse until it’s all the way out.",Sandy
3,Premarin,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10.0,,"October 30, 2020",60,"Premarin is a miracle for me.  I'd been menopausal for 11 years, the last 2-3 of which I'd been suffering deep major clinical depression. The pandemic made it worse. My last menstrual period was more than 10 most ago. Still depressed, summer came, and the hot flashes started! And a bunch of difficult personal things happened that I really had to deal with and be present for, and finally I just had nothing left.  I had no reserve, I had no buffer I got to the point where a broken pencil might send me to bed for the whole day.I hardly ate. I was living on a knife's edge emotionally. I nearly cracked.  I couldn't handle it anymore. Premarin save my life! After just a week on the starter dose of .3mg, I felt like a new person/my old self. It is a miracle it's been about a month and I'm still feeling great on that low dose,; we're just going to stick with it for now. I am hoping it will bring my ability to orgasm back. That just went away one day, a few months ago...poof! Bummer...",Starza
4,Premarin,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"July 30, 2020",33,"21 years old had two babies, endometriosis, was told I won't have anymore babies. Uterus was tilted and prolapsed. Didn't use birth control, due to ob-gyn said it would be a miracle to get pregnant. Got pregnant two more times, had a hysterectomy with last baby. I was put on many different hormones and none seemed to help my extreme moods, dry skin and wrinkles. Finally, I was told to try Premarin. It is very expensive, and insurance doesn't cover them, but it was like a dream come true. I became at peace, happy, and my skin became soft, wrinkles disappeared, and my sex life wasn't dormant anymore.  I've got so many friends now using it, due to me telling them about my ""happy pill"", Premarin!",TIRA

6,Premarin,Postmenopausal Symptoms,4.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 8, 2020",56,"I was given premarin for hot flashes and vaginal irritation from vaginal dryness. It helped with my sex drive. I still have vaginal irritation and dryness from time to time. Now I'm wondering is I have a yeast infection because I have some burning. I've only been on it for one month. I suffer from depression and all this has caused me to lose weight, about 40lbs. My night sweats have improved but during the day they are bad. I don't know what is going on with this vaginal irritation. It's the worst. I'm 47. I'm irritated and moody and get annoyed quickly. My poor husband doesn't know what to do.

Worked great for all my menopause symptoms. My doctor recently told me to stop taking the medication due to the side affects in which one that caught my attention was blood clots.

12,Premarin,Postmenopausal Symptoms,5.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 17, 2019",16,I highly recommend adding a bio-identical to a premarin regimen.  I began experiencing overactive bladder and recurrent UTIs.  My PCP did not recommend an OBGYN until I was having the UTIs and wanted a compounded prescription.  My dosage was played-with or changed many times without doing any bloodwork by my PCP.  Don't think your PCP knows what they're doing.  Get in touch with a doctor who works with a compounding pharmacy that specializes in hormone replacement.,KC
13,Premarin,Postmenopausal Symptoms,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 25, 2018",54,"Doc prescribed it, but asked her to switch to Estrace and have good results. Y'all do realize that Premarine is a shortened version of Pregnant Mare Urine which is what it's made from? They take large (most commonly Belgium Draft Horses) and confine them in small stalls for their 11-month gestation with their tails tied up and catheters on to harvest their urine. Female foals are cycled back into the program. Males are useless so sold off to auction houses, some are lucky to get purchased by rescues, others are sold to end up as horsemeat in other countries. The mares are bred again once they've foaled to continue the cycle. Ironic that a drug developed to help post productive human females is derived from horrific treatment of female horses during their productive years.  It is an awful life.

14,Premarin,Postmenopausal Symptoms,8.0,,"March 18, 2018",8,"Experienced menopause at an early age, had extreme menstrual problems from the beginning starting at about age 8. I am told after going through much menstrual problems my whole life I have several fibroids. Hoping that after menopause they would naturally shrink. Mine grew and cause me extreme pain. Hormone therapy has relieved this pain. However side effects I think cause me anxiety and I cry easily. When I try to cut back I only take it twice a week the pain comes back which is severe. I cannot stop taking it but the cost is almost $300 of prescription for I have no insurance for this.

I have never taken prempro or any progestin product, just the Premarin alone.  I tried the half strength, miserable with all day hot flashes so over heated looked like I had a sunburn with heat rash and nasty skin breakouts, so I changed Drs, now back to the 1.25 strength. .

20,Premarin,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 22, 2016",108,"I was in the DEEPEST pit of depression. I felt that it was hormonal. Had labs drawn and was shown to be in menopause. Had a hysterectomy which left me with one ovary. The depression started this year in March and spiralled out of control. I was seriously deciding whether or not to stick around not because I didn't want to live, but the mental pain was too much. I noticed in a study of women that were treated successfully for severe hormonal depression using premarin and mirtazipine. Within 24 hours the depression was GONE GONE GONE! I believe it is mostly the premarin because ADs take longer than that to work. I want to start a campaign for the horses that are being treated to poorly.

26,Premarin,Postmenopausal Symptoms,10.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"January 14, 2015",127,"Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) - I took Prempro for two years after becoming menopausal at age 40.

Without HRT I experience irritability and irrational rage, hot flashes, and a non-existent sex drive. The current HRT which includes Premarin, works very well for me.  It is frustrating how difficult it is for a woman in her 40s to be taken seriously by the medical community for complaints of low libido. (Consider Viagra, etc. for men).
