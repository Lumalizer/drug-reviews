0,Rifampin,Tuberculosis Latent,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 2, 2021",2,"I took this for a few months about 3 years ago now for suspected latent TB I contracted after a holiday in Thailand. I was quite apprehensive, but I had no serious side effects.  Your urine is a bit of an alarm colour when you first see it!  Had a minor freak out the first time. Pills are big, think I had some pins and needles in my feet, I  can't really remember anything  else of note, maybe some upset stomach. The only major difficulty I recall was not being able to drink alcohol, eat cured meats, tomatoes  or cheese which was hard for me! I did forget a few times and realise while eating a cheese sandwich, it's then when you notice who strong it is, especially with cheese, sour cream etc - it made me feel faint, bit like a small panic attack. Very weird!  As I recall it suddenly raise your blood pressure if you eat certain things, so do pay attention to the diet advice! All in all miles better than I expected, and about a 1000 times better than having TB. Best wishes.",The Morg
1,Rifampin,Tuberculosis Latent,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 17, 2021",1,"My first day of R, diagnosed with latent TB. I took mine on empty stomach 2 hours later, I felt nausea and lightheaded. I ate and I took nap on my lunch time, then  woke up groggy, and now I have a headache as I type this. Advil ok ?  How can you functions with all the side effects?",Jill
2,Rifampin,Tuberculosis Latent,2.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"July 18, 2021",1,This was a follow up to my previous review. In case anyone experiences this in the future turns out it was oral thrush developed either because of rifampin or my use of eye steroid drops. Rifampin after a few days did however elevate my thyroid levels. I do not plan on taking this medication in the near future only if the need is absolutely required.,Bad Reaction
3,Rifampin,Tuberculosis Latent,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 21, 2020",2,"Diagnosed with latent TB. So I took the 4 month treatment option 600 mg dosage thinking that would be the easy route. After a week , I had constant diarrhea and developed hives skin rash. Also developed joint pain around ankles and behind my knees. I told the doctor and immediately stopped taking Rifampin. It's been  4 weeks since that time, the hives are still there but luckily no more diarrhea and joint pain have lessened.",Never again
4,Rifampin,Tuberculosis Latent,4.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"June 25, 2020",2,"Prescribed rifampin for latent TB infection. The first month the only side effect was headaches. Followed by insomnia, fatigue and the odd severe stomach cramp. Not a particularly nice drug!",Mon
5,Rifampin,Tuberculosis Latent,6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 30, 2020",4,"I have been on Rifampin for three months now  for TB and I have one month left. The side effects of the medication are not severe, but they are annoying. At first, I noticed a decreased appetite, but that lasted only a month. I do, however, continue to have upper stomach pain and a feeling of extreme fullness after almost every meal (I take an OTC antacid and gas relief pill and that helps relieve some of the pain). I have developed a pretty bad acne rash on my forehead that was never there before I started Rifampin. I have also noticed frequent lightheadedness after standing up, which never happened before this medication. Lastly, I have experienced a weight loss of about 15 lbs since starting Rifampin. Overall, the medication is bearable, but it has been annoying and I will be happy when I no longer have to take it.",ayada72
6,Rifampin,Tuberculosis Latent,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 17, 2020",2,"I was prescribed Rifampin in January of 2020 for latent TB.  I have about 3 more weeks.  When I first started taking it I only had headaches.  The headaches subsided.  As the months go by it gets worse.  I now have no appetite, consistent diarrhea, extreme fatigue and nausea.  I had to take this medication to be able to continue taking my RA medication.  I will be so glad when this is over.  It seems as if there is nothing that can be done.",Mini Granny
7,Rifampin,Tuberculosis Latent,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 2, 2020",4,"I was advised to take the rifampin treatment 3 weeks ago for latent TB and I am still taking it. My experience was terrible. I have fever everyday, nerve pain, I vomit, head ache and I also lose my appetite. Hope I will feel better, please pray for me.",Mon
8,Rifampin,Tuberculosis Latent,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 9, 2020",11,I was on this medication for 4 months for latent  tuberculosis not terrible at all and way better than the other 9 month treatment. Only side effects I experienced were the color change of fluids some lightheadedness and minor arthritis pain.,CAcat
9,Rifampin,Tuberculosis Latent,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 2, 2019",16,"I have been started on Rifampin 600mg every day for 4 months for Latent TB. First week was okay, but starting the second week, I’ve had severe headache and sore throat. I had to be rushed to the ER due to the severe pain in my head and neck with difficulty in swallowing. CT scan showed that I have enlarged lymph nodes on both sides of my neck. My blood sugar also is elevated. The doctor prescribed me Motrin as needed for my headache, and it has been working. It is true that Rifampin treatment is a tough one. I’m happy for those who experience only minor side effects. Please do pray for me. Thank you.",Latent
10,Rifampin,Tuberculosis Latent,4.0,,"April 25, 2016",17,"I've been on Rifampin for one month and I've had all sorts of side effects. Some days I'm fine, other days not so much. At night I break out in sweats, I got thrush so I had to take medicine for that. I go to doctor in a couple of days and I need to find out if I can stop it. I don't want to go through this for 3  more months.",turnover4585
11,Rifampin,Tuberculosis Latent,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 17, 2015",20,"I just finished a 4 month regimen of Rifampin.  It was prescribed when I was tested for TB in preparation for starting on a biologic for Rheumatoid Arthritis.  I have no idea how/when I was exposed to TB but I couldn't start the biologic until the latent TB was addressed.  I will never know if it was ""effective"" since I will always test positive for TB antigens but I'm glad I took it-didn't have much of a choice!  It was not an easy medication to take but I got through the course of treatment better than I anticipated.  I did have slight nausea at the beginning and intermittent watery diarrhea throughout.  I don't know if the other side effects (fatigue, primarily) I experienced were side effects of Rifampin or symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.",LWD
12,Rifampin,Tuberculosis Latent,9.0,,"January 26, 2012",18,"Although it makes my urine darker yellow/orangish color, I rarely experience significant side effects.  Occasionally it will upset my stomach, but once you eat that goes away.  Hardest part is sticking to the schedule, but I'd rather worry about that for 4 months than 9 or more.",Anonymous
13,Rifampin,Tuberculosis Latent,5.0,,"September 17, 2011",22,"This is a very intense antibiotic with persistent side effects. I have been on this medication for one month and continue to experience nausea and vomiting. I have been fortunate to not experience reddening of my saliva or tears, but other body fluids have changed. My hepatic enzymes have more than doubled baseline values and continue to climb. It does its job well, but it is a tough 4 months to get through.",Anonymous
