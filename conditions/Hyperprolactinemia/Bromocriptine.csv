0,Bromocriptine,Hyperprolactinemia,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 23, 2022",0,"Parlodel (bromocriptine):My prolactin level went very high after my ovarian cyst surgery, I was prescribed bromocriptine, for the very first time in years, I experienced the ovulation discharge. But the side effects were awful, confusion, anxiety, shakiness, headache, weight loss, nausea/vomiting. Could barely eat anything. Gave me high blood pressure and panic attacks. It's very effective but they could work on the side effects",Anonymous

2,Bromocriptine,Hyperprolactinemia,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 26, 2020",19,Parlodel (bromocriptine):I have been on this medication for 30 years to control a prolactin secreting pituitary macroadenoma. I chose medication over surgery and today I take a maintenance dose of 2.5 mg twice a day. In the beginning I had severe headaches and nausea but the side effects stopped after a couple months. After two months of treatment my tumor had shrunk from 13 mm to undetectable on a CT scan. Parlodel can be a game changer for those that can tolerate it.,DeeDee
3,Bromocriptine,Hyperprolactinemia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 16, 2020",3,I started Bromocriptine this Saturday after 7 years of taking Cabergoline and Cyberknife one year ago. My prolactin level increased after stopping Cabergoline for 6 months due to the panic attacks I would get. I decided to start Bromocriptine because to see if it would be better. I went to Church today and I had to sit down as I felt that I was going to pass out. The words on the teleprompter got blurry. I had to leave church early and I did not make it to bathroom before I started to vomit. I am going to change it to bedtime to see how it works and take 1/2 of the 2.5 mg. Cabergoline gave me nausea until I found out that I have to take it in the am when I am feeling good and active. Thanks to your all feedback.,Nadzy
4,Bromocriptine,Hyperprolactinemia,10.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"November 27, 2019",28,"I know how difficult is to pass the first 2-3 days of taking bromocriptine, I felt unbalanced as I couldn't stand properly because I was literally swinging, I felt that nausea and constipation, difficulty in breathing and clogged nose at night (I woke up couple of nights because I couldn't breathe). But it was totally worth it. My results are fantastic. This medication treated my high prolactin level and greenish discharge from breasts. Even my period became shorter and much easier to pass. What I would like to recommend is that make sure you're not taking a high dose from the begging, take 1/4 for like 2-4 days and increase by 1/2 after and take full pill if prescribed. I know it's not easy to pass the time while you're on it, but it's totally worth it. After a week I forgot about side effects and was living a normal life. Right now it's my second month of bromocriptine and I expect to be totally cured. Good luck!",COV123

I started feeling an awful nausea around 4am I couldn't sleep. When I woke up in the morning I had no energy to walk or talk, I felt like was dying. I also experienced dizziness and I kept blocking out, My eyes were blurry, I had diarrhea and my belly was bloated as well as belly pain. I had no appetite for food, and that was just in one day. I didn't want to work that day because of side effects. I skipped the pill for two days and I am still experiencing loss of appetite and nausea. Last night I vomited twice,  I couldn't consume any food whatsoever and whatever Ieat felt disgusting. I am wondering if  I should discontinue use or contact my gynecologist.",matic

I was asked to do a prolactin level test and it was 26.5, which is just a little higher than the normal range which 25. Before bromo, My cycle has been abnormal I must say, because it fluctuates between 21 and 24 days. It was too short. Because of the way implantation works, I was finding it difficult to get pregnant. Within the first 3 weeks of bromocriptine, the breast milk stopped but I was asked to continue. I am so happy my cycle has been 25 days for 2 months straight. I only had side effects like passing out instantly but I was told to take the drug just before bedtime, so I did not really feel it.I will recommend this drug for anybody.",Womzylala

10,Bromocriptine,Hyperprolactinemia,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 9, 2017",9,"Just started Bromocriptine 2.5 mg. Took the pill around 9:30pm and was OK for an hour or so (mild cramping), went to sleep and woke up around 4a.m I could not see my vision was completely distorted, the room was spinning, my legs and my arms felt like jello and I swore I could smell and taste the pill. Scariest experience ever. Next day still have pounding head ache and dizziness. Do not recommend this medication. Had better luck with the Cabergoline (although health coverage doesn't cover it  - you bet I'll be paying the monthly fee for no side effects).",Rach101x
11,Bromocriptine,Hyperprolactinemia,,Taken for less than 1 month,"September 30, 2017",24,I have been using this product for the past 3 weeks and I have little side effects because I use only 1 tablets per day as instructed by my doctor. I am using this for my high prolactin level and I must say I'm seeing a huge difference. My breast is no longer firm and milk is no longer thick and sticky. Its actually coming out like clear liquid n resemble water. Hopefully my level should be back to normal. I am yet to do another test to see the desired results. At the moment its 60 so within another month of use I should be able to be cured and become pregnant.,Teena30

At first a half dose of the lowest dose of 2.5 mg.  I've experienced side effects immediately.  The most troublesome is the overall fatigue and extreme nausea.  I just moved to a full dose of 2.5 mg last night.   Today my nausea has increased horribly.  Last night extreme and violent vomiting.  I'm sick to my stomach, weak and some shortness of breath occurred last night and still remains.  I noticed improvement in my symptoms in a few days and now they seem a bit escalated for my breast milk reduced and now seem I'm producing more than ever.

17,Bromocriptine,Hyperprolactinemia,2.0,,"October 14, 2013",17,"I was prescribed Bromocriptine, as it seems to be the only available medication for treatment of high prolactin levels caused by my pituitary brain tumor. Unfortunately within a couple of weeks I was unable to stay awake for any length of time, even at the lowest dose possible. Although my prolactin levels did come down briefly and I had one menstrual period after 6 weeks, I had to stop taking the medication because of the Severe Chronic Fatigue caused by the bromocriptine.  I have since tried it 3 times in the past 5 years out of desperation and have had the same result each time. I simply can't function within 2 weeks of starting the medication. I'm desperate to have a semblance of my life back and available medications are limited at best!",trained2servejc

With it, I have had two successful pregnancies, though with minimal side effects. So much happy to become a parent after six years of infertility. It had also helped me with a benign tumor in my brain, and I think I'm a normal woman now. I was initially placed on half the tablet a day but later increased to 1 and 1/2 a day, with series of blood tests and MRI scans. It really helped and I'm still using it with routine checkups.",bukky
19,Bromocriptine,Hyperprolactinemia,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 12, 2013",27,I've been taking bromocriptine since I was 18 I'm now 38. It has successfully reduced the size of my tumor and lowered my prolactin levels to a normal range. Any attempt to reduce or stop taking it causes the tumor to increase in size and as a result my prolactin rises. I have Raynauds and yes I would agree bromocriptine does make it slightly worse but it's manageable. I've had nausea but only if I've taken my dose on an empty stomach which I've learned to avoid. Overall I'm happy with this medication and have no issues taking it daily and experience only a few of the side effects none of which would make me stop taking it.,T17
