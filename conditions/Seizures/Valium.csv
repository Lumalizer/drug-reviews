0,Valium,Seizures,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 23, 2020",9,"I used to have focal onset seizures which came on very suddenly, and they would appear as panic attacks. My right leg would jump and jerk and so would my arm and fingers as I stood in a lineup anywhere, and these seizures would come on completely at random. They would happen at fast food outlets, or banks, or restaurants. They were more of a nuisance than anything drastic. I had a sudden attack in my vehicle whilst I was driving, and that was the last straw. I finally saw my GP, who prescribed me Valium for focal seizure control and anxiety control. I turned out to be amazing for both, and I'm feeling better than I've ever felt before! Valium does make you feel sleepy, and should never be mixed with alcohol though. Just exercise caution, and always use as directed.",Feelingbetternow

2,Valium,Seizures,10,,"December 22, 2011",66,"Wonder drug, stops seizures, stops things that can bring on a seizure, stops pain after seizures, stops bad side effects of my other anti-seizure medicines. I could not take any other seizure medicines but Valium helped. Not enough sleep can cause a seizure and Valium helps me sleep.",Anonymous
