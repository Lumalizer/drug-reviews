0,Trileptal,Seizures,8.0,,"March 26, 2022",0,"300mg x2 a day of Trileptal caused water retention and swollen lymph nodes. However reducing it to 300mg along with Keppra 250mg x 2 a day has worked wonders for me. The Trileptal helps me sleep and helps with moodiness caused by Keppra. Keppra controls seizures very well. Overall, Trileptal is a great medication with little side effects. This combination of medicine is great for me.",Electrogirl
1,Trileptal,Seizures,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 13, 2021",10,THIS WAS THE MEDICATIONI had epilepsy for 8 years mainly during puberty years. I was on trileptal once before the last time but due to the low dosage the medication was ineffective. I went to a new doctor and he placed me back on trileptal but increased the dosage of the pill and that was the beginning of being 4 years seizure free and then I was given the news after 5 years that I had officially outgrew my epilepsy.,mads
2,Trileptal,Seizures,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"June 14, 2019",32,"I had my first seizure at the age of 20, I am healthy otherwise. I was diagnosed with a  typeof seizure  caused by a small Heterotopia and put on 600 mg of Trileptal twice daily. I was seizure free for 15 years until 3 days ago. The only side effect was weight gain. I see my neurologist tomorrow and am anticipating an increase in dose. I would highly recommend this medicine to anyone doing research.",Anonymous
3,Trileptal,Seizures,10.0,,"November 21, 2017",35,"I started taking Trileptal when Tegretol stopped working for me.  I love this medication.  I developed epilepsy following a head injury (diving accident) when I was 8 years old. I've had seizures (daytime absence, daytime partial, nocturnal grand mal) since then.  Tegretol worked for me for years, then stopped working.  Trileptal has been my only seizure medication for the past 11 years and I couldn't be happier.  I have to add salt to my diet, and I get very flush whenever I exert myself, but being completely seizure free is worth these small inconveniences.",girlwiththebadbrain
4,Trileptal,Seizures,,,"June 14, 2017",10,"My daughter is 5 years old and has been healthy, and has been developing at a normal rate. I heard  a loud thud. I found my daughter  on the floor. There was vomit on the bed and my daughter  was on the floor. It lasted 15 minutes. It was so scary. She was jerking very violently, and her eyes were rolling in the back of his head. It was horrible.  No one should have to see their child like that,  my doctor is saying she's had seizures. She had an MRI ,an EEG,they did a spinal tap. After returning from the hospital, my daughter experienced vomiting, I could not bear to see my daughter going through this problem at the early age of her life. I read a lot of fake testimonies at blogs, facebook and website of people that was cured from seizure",alfred marta
5,Trileptal,Seizures,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 4, 2016",12,"Although this medication did decrease my daughters absence seizures, if she took this at any time 30 min before or after eating, she had a severe reaction.  Her throat would burn inside and out, her face would flush, she would get dizzy and unable to focus. This would last about 5-10 min. and then she would get so tired, she would instantly fall asleep and sleep for hours.  She was at a pretty high dose during this time 1050mg 2x daily.  We finally stopped this medication, because of the stress of having to watch so closely when she ate and when she could take this medication.",Anonymous
6,Trileptal,Seizures,6.0,,"July 17, 2016",42,"I have temporal lobe seizures. I have taken Trileptal for many years and it has helped controlled the seizures. However; I have been having issues with low sodium. The doctors blame it on the Trileptal. So to fix the problem, they suggest eating high sodium foods, fluid restriction, and no water. Water dilutes the sodium. They also suggested that I add about a teaspoon of salt to my meals. So what I do for thirst is drink Gatorade but only a few sips. But you got to becareful and not to drink more than a liter of fluid in a day as this is what is recommended by the doctor. My neurologist recommended that I drink gatorade. So most of the time I drink Gatorade when I eat my meals.",Marge S
7,Trileptal,Seizures,,,"October 22, 2015",60,"I have been on Trileptal for about a month now.  I'm taking 300 mg twice a day. I had an abnormal EEG and diagnosed with right-sided temporal lobe epilepsy. I started having pain 5 yrs ago -intense, daily pain in my right eye and eventually extended further up on the right side of my head (which is related to the epilepsy). I was also suffering from repeated inappropriate thoughts (of sexual nature) very disturbing and disrupted my life. I have since found out that OCD behavior very frequently accompanies temporal lobe epilepsy. Trileptal has stopped the partial sz and inappropriate thoughts. Indocin 25 mg is controlling the pain. Hope this helps others.",doglover68
8,Trileptal,Seizures,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 1, 2014",48,"Due to possible heart failure about 15 years ago I started having partial seizures waking up in airplanes or hotels not knowing were I was for some time and than gradually became alert until I started with many severe seizures. I started with Tegretol and then switched with Trileptal that was very effective. Forgot to take it a few times and had seizures until I became very conscious of the need and since then I am quite well. I need to stay far from confrontations and conflicts. I currently take 1,500 MG daily (600 morning, 300 dinner 600 @ sleep). My sodium level suffered a lot but I am good on it now. The way to balance it is with coconut water, sports drink and adding a bit more on home cooking. It is a super medicine. I miss my red wine!",Jo√ßao Humberto Silva
9,Trileptal,Seizures,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 8, 2014",20,"I have spacial seizures.  I take 1200 mg per day.  It has been 100% effective for the last two years.  I had about six months of problems after I began taking Lipitor, but none since I was taken off the Lipitor.  I'm a 67 year old male who has had seizures for over 30 years.  It has been as effective as Tegretol was until it stopped working after 14 years.  I had a short bout with low sodium after open heart surgery.",Anonymous

Had MRI and a eeg no signs of anything they were normal. With not be able to find what type of seizures they are its hard to find help from anywhere.

But I've been in trileptal for 1 month now and since the seizures has picked up which I didn't like that at all. I called the doctor which is surpose to be a seizure specialist and she said to up the medication And that's when I noticed they were coming more than they normally do and I noticed up set stomach. No success with it at all!,Randi-B34
11,Trileptal,Seizures,,,"January 10, 2013",69,"My son of 7 has been on Trileptal for 2 weeks. Immediately the most evident side effect was solemness. A week into therapy he was playing outside and complained of dizziness, weakness and pain all over. Thanks to literature at Novartis site is very comprehensive so I found out about Hyponatremia (sodium level becoming very low). A few drops of concentrated table salt solution in both ears immediately took care of the problem. As for seizures, he hadn't had any. But then, we only found out about his rare nocturnal seizures by coincidence. He did have night terrors twice a month before. We haven't had any of those yet.",ASJ
12,Trileptal,Seizures,10.0,,"October 17, 2011",47,I was having seizures off and on for almost 4 yrs. Diagnosing this was difficult because I could never had a witness or could describe the symptoms. I was averaging 1 per month then I got worse. I had 4 in two weeks but all of them had witnesses. I called my doctor and he ran heart tests and an MRI on my head. That's when he said I had Partial Epilepsy and gave me the Trileptal. I've been taking it for 6 weeks and haven't had any problems since then. I like this pill very much and the best part is its only $4 a month.,Jimbo59

In another month or two we are planning on slowly taking her off. So I will find out soon exactly how well it has been working.,Anonymous
15,Trileptal,Seizures,,,"January 13, 2011",55,"My son has been taking this medication for about 2 months now.  Before he got on the medicine he was really mean and talked back.  I found that he was not happy, crying all the time for now reason at all.  He would have a seizure and about 10 times a day.  It got where it was really hard.  I finally got him to see a great doctor. She put him on this medicine and there hasn't been a seizure yet and he is playing laughing and having fun again.  I really thank who ever came out with this medicine.",Anonymous
16,Trileptal,Seizures,7.0,,"November 6, 2010",35,"Been taking Trileptal for about a year. Mostly because every 5 to 6 years have to change my medicine because I tend to get immune to them. Have taken Sodium  Valproate, Tegretol and Carbamazepine over the last 30 years. With Oxcarb seizures are controlled but not totally gone. Also, am putting on extraordinary amount of weight, looking for other options for what is becoming an obesity problem.",Sarita Rani
17,Trileptal,Seizures,9.0,,"January 5, 2010",49,"I have been taking Trileptal for almost 1 month now and its such a life saver. I have been suffering from partial epilepsy for more then a year since I have been going to the hospital for almost 5/6 months and they could not discover what the problem was so I had to see a private doctor who diagnosed me with partial epilepsy and put me on Trileptal. As soon as I took these tablets it reduced the attacks to 1 every two days and after a month it completely got rid of it, so I am really happy with these. However, I do feel slightly drowsy after taking them but that does not matter since its taken all the seizures away which was my main concern since life just felt like hell prior to these. So I would definitely recommend it.",Elve

20,Trileptal,Seizures,8.0,,"September 5, 2008",70,"I have taken the drug for about 6 years with positive results for seizures.  The seizures have subsided to about 1-2 partial complex seizures per month.  I do go through periods of depression, especially when the prescibed amount is changed.  I'm currently taking 1200 mg in the AM and 1500 mg PM.  It's probably the best seizure medication I've taken to date, and I've been on almost all of them at some point in my life over the past 30 years or so.",Anonymous
