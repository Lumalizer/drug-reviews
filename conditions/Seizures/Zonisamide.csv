0,Zonisamide,Seizures,8.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"November 12, 2021",0,"I started having seizures after 3 months of giving birth to my son by c section in 1999. My first Dr put me on zonagran and I was seizure free, but then lost my health insurance due to a divorce, so I moved back to SC, they put me on phenobarbital? Omg no.Then Depakote and that was worse. So I finally got my new neurologist to give zonagran again, just picked it up tonight.  It worked for me back then so I'm hoping as I've age it's still gonna be the best for me. We are all different and we know what works for us Praying this will be my magic drug again. I don't remember any bad side effects.  I just don't know why we have to fight tooth and nail to get our disability.  I have a court hearing I'm Feb of 2022. Been fighting them for 5 year's.  I don't drive anymore and already. Wish me luck",Lisa

All of the doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me, and I was in the hospital for 9 days. I stopped the meds as a last resort It effected my mental health, ability to think, and gave me weakness, numbness, muscle cramps, dizziness, and a chronic pain pain  that felt my entire skeleton was in a pressure cooker.",Hannah
3,Zonisamide,Seizures,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 18, 2021",1,My husband has suffered three major strokes since 2007. The final one in 2008 left him with partial complex seizures. He was given Tegretol 300 mg twice a day. This didn't stop his seizures and then he was given 300 mg twice a day of Zonegram (Generic Zonisimide) in addition to the Tegretol. His seizures have been controlled and the side effects have been minimal except for the extreme loss of appetite and sleepiness. He was a robust 230 pounds when starting this medicine and now barely weighs 150 pounds. He is physically impaired and practically bedridden due to the weight loss and muscle loss. I am also suspect that it affected his dental health as he kept losing his teeth one by one until he has full dentures now. I  know that the weight loss may have been due in part to his dental issues but I have read the many reviews concerning weight loss which I believe is being caused in part to this medication. He has also experienced light headedness and short term memory loss.,Sherrose
4,Zonisamide,Seizures,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 28, 2021",5,"Zonisamide has essentially ruined my life since being put on it. It caused one seizure because the memory issues caused by the drug led me to forget to take my seizure meds and seize, but aside from that I’m just anxious, nauseous, and exhausted 24/7! In my house, it is known as Zombisamide. I opted to titrate onto Lamictal as soon as humanly possible.",SeizureBB420
5,Zonisamide,Seizures,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"July 25, 2021",0,"I have been on this drug for almost 1 year. Originally the doctor wanted me to titrate up to 300mg a day. Starting with 100mg the first week. By day 3, I was afraid to leave the house because of how frequently I was having daily bowel movements. 10+ times a day. And it was loose as if I took a laxative. By the evening of day 4 on the drug, I had a massive seizure like I haven't had in years! They readjusted the titration rate to 50mg a week instead, until reaching the 300mg prescribed dosage. It kind of helped with the digestive issue. But by week 3 when I upped the dose to 150mg, I could not reach R.E.M. sleep at all. So I stopped at 50mg in the a.m. and p.m. The neuro did not seem to be willing to take me off the drug. Instead, recommended melatonin. I still go to the bathroom more than what is considered normal. As for my mood, even though covid was happening last year, I was a much happier person pre Zonisamide. I see a new neuro soon.",Aggasi

Social activities are out of the question. I am so anxious and paranoid all the time, I get a feeling that someone is behind me even if I’m lying down or standing up against a wall. I haven’t battled with depression that’s been this intense before. This stuff makes me feel non- existent. All I want to do is sleep. It made me weak physically, emotionally, and mentally. It’s changing my personality and my relationships. It made me so angry and hurtful. It’s scary stuff.

When I upped my dose to 200 mgs., it was like someone set a fire in my stomach.  I called the doctor and went off of it that day.  I did notice that my personality changed as well.

My kidney was full of them, a CT tech told me she’d never seen so many, so big. Also it gives me the dumbs, and I’m in a smart people field of work, so I frequently feel stupid.

Anxiety, depression, panic, suicidal thoughts, sense of impending doom and uncontrollable fear. Those are just the side effects that I was worried about. Unfortunately I had others too. I asked to be taken off the medication and was instead lowered to a 25mg dose but still had the same side effects daily. After 2 days of unprovoked  crying episodes and a trip to the emergency room for chest pain I asked  the emergency room doctor what I should do. The doctor advised me to stop taking it because it is notorious for causing bad side effects. The worst part about the whole experience is that I still had seizures and I believe the side effects caused a permanent anxiety disorder.",Feeling hopeless

Next week I will be upping it to 300mg daily and maxing out there for about a month to see how my body fully reacts to the 300mg daily.Zonegran, so far, is the first medication to help with the seizures. It definitely has lessened the length of my seizures, and how often. The side effects aren’t even close to how bad side effects have been on any other anti-seizure meds. I am definitely very drowsy, a little more irritable, moving slower, and feeling foggy. Have way less of an appetite and not eating early as much. I am having some headaches. Aside from that, I’m happy with this medicine so far. Finding the right medicine can be so frustrating and makes you feel so alone sometimes. Hoping this comment can help others as well!
