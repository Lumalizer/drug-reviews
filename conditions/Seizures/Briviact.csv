0,Briviact,Seizures,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 2, 2022",1,"I was on 1500 MG of Keppra everyday after a seizure, which happened a year after brain surgery (I was on 500mg after the surgery) to remove a benign tumor. I had major depression and irritability, aggression. I was ok most of the time but I would go into depression if I thought about sad things and things would set me off to the point of shouting and pounding my fists on the counter. I switched to BRIVIACT 100mg twice a day, and it is like night and day. The mood swings and rage issues stopped. I am not sure how it would compare to how I was before being on any meds for this, but compared to Keppra I feel like a normal human again. I am generally a very mellow kind person so its nice to return to my old self. No numbness or panic attacks except another seizure after 2 years when I had missed a dose, plus I had more alcohol than over the holidays AND it turned out I had mild Covid (Had all vaccine doses, but had slight fever), all 3 reduce the meds effectiveness.",Brian-californi

3,Briviact,Seizures,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 4, 2021",21,"I wish my Dr told me this was a controlled substance. I feel horrible on it and I feel even worse then horrible trying to get off. Tinnitus, depression, anger, irritability, panic attacks, sadness, and now in withdrawal add severe insomnia. I can't wait 2 get off & rest my brain. Keppra worked. This drug is nothing like it for me. And so much harder 2 get off then any other anti- epileptic med I have taken.",Lily

9,Briviact,Seizures,9.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 20, 2018",52,I was prescribed Briviact (am & pm). This replaced Keppra which caused severe mood issues.  I have been on Briviact for 3 months.  No notable side effects compared to the numerous anti-seizure medications I have taken the past thirty years.  Seems to be working.  I may still be having partial seizures but no tonic clonic seizures or complex partial seizures.  I take it along with Topiramate (am & pm).  I'm quite pleased with the Briviact.  I know everyone is different but I hope this information is helpful to anyone considering it.  Good luck.,PT

So glad to find a good med, finally! Took it again this morning, and I felt ok. Then about 2.5 hours before time to take it again, it was a completely different story  I was nervous, irritable, agitated, want to scream my head off, tense, feeling like the incredible Hulk is going to explode out of my body, want to cry, don't talk to me, don't touch me, don't look at me, don't breathe my direction, eyes darting back and forth, and serious drug withdrawal kind of feeling!!! NO!!! I WILL NOT BE TAKING MY NEXT DOSE!!!",Tjsnomore

It is easier to take just one pill in the AM and one in the PM but that's about it.Also very expensive and my insurance would only pay for 50% of it. For me it does work well",Partial Onset Focal
