1,Zonegran,Seizures,1.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 23, 2021",1,"This medication is toxic. I was on it and vimpat for years and it made me so sick that I couldn’t walk. All of the doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me, and I was in the hospital for 9 days. I stopped the meds as a last resort It effected my mental health, ability to think, and gave me weakness, numbness, muscle cramps, dizziness, and a chronic pain pain  that felt my entire skeleton was in a pressure cooker.",Hannah
2,Zonegran,Seizures,1.0,,"May 2, 2021",25,"Zonegran has stopped my seizures, but I'D RATHER HAVE SEIZURES THAN DEAL WITH THESE SIDE EFFECTS. I lost my job due this medication. I am 21 years old and tried watching Harry Potter... couldn’t understand a thing. Words do not click for me anymore. I had to set reminders for everything b/c I can’t even remember simple tasks. Social activities are out of the question. I am so anxious and paranoid all the time, I get a feeling that someone is behind me even if I’m lying down or standing up against a wall. I haven’t battled with depression that’s been this intense before. This stuff makes me feel non- existent. All I want to do is sleep. It made me weak physically, emotionally, and mentally. It’s changing my personality and my relationships. It made me so angry and hurtful. It’s scary stuff. I wouldn’t recommend this medication, especially those that already cannot communicate clearly due to age or disability.",Peaches
3,Zonegran,Seizures,9.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 30, 2021",9,"I've had complex partial seizures for 14 years half of my life the longest I've went was 3 weeks without a seizure. I have had two brain surgeries also have the Neuropace implant. I've been on so many different seizure medications, still am but my doctor wanted to try me on Zonegran a few weeks ago. Raising the dose every two weeks. I was terrified of the side effects but also happy of one of them, the weight loss because I really need that, this medication so far has helped me beat my record in 14 years become one month seizure free!! And I'm not even on my full dose yet! And I've lost 11 pounds! I really recommend trying out this medication it might not work for everyone but it's worth a shot. The side effects can be rough at first but my body got used to it.",Anonymous
4,Zonegran,Seizures,3.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 19, 2021",4,"I've been on primidone for 35 years.  My doctor wanted to switch to Zonegran because of my headaches.  It definitely stopped the headaches but I couldn't sleep.  However, I wasn't tired the next day either.  Two weeks in, I noticed that I was having heartburn but it was controllable.  When I upped my dose to 200 mgs., it was like someone set a fire in my stomach.  I called the doctor and went off of it that day.  I did notice that my personality changed as well.  It didn't work for me but I'm sure others have had better results.",Joe
5,Zonegran,Seizures,1.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 18, 2021",6,RUN DO NOT walk from this medicine. I used this for about a month. It's a useless medicine. More of a get rid of you medicine.Causes a whole load of problem that you don't need,truth teller
6,Zonegran,Seizures,1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"November 16, 2020",14,"This drug Zonegran made me angry, depressed, and generally uninterested in life.The cognitive effects are pretty severe as well.  Almost lost my job due to my performance while on zonegran. When I stopped taking it I felt like someone lifted the fog  and turned the lights on again.  \",David
7,Zonegran,Seizures,5.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"August 27, 2020",10,"This week I've started on 50mg Zonegran at night and over the next few weeks will be increasing to 200mg daily. This is the 9th AED I have tried for my complex partial epilepsy. I am taking this in conjunction with 400mg Tegretol daily and 10-30mg Frisium daily. I experience auras daily and have seizures approx. once a week. Since starting this drug, I have not experienced any auras or seizures...however, it is too early to know if it is actually working. The side effects so far have been rather uncomfortable. This includes headaches, nausea, loss of appetite and feeling more tired/foggy than usual. Hoping the side effects will lessen over the next few weeks!",Letssee
8,Zonegran,Seizures,7.0,,"June 18, 2020",54,"I have been on 100mg daily of Zonegran for 1 week. Today I will be upping my dose to 200mg daily. Next week I will be upping it to 300mg daily and maxing out there for about a month to see how my body fully reacts to the 300mg daily.Zonegran, so far, is the first medication to help with the seizures. It definitely has lessened the length of my seizures, and how often. The side effects aren’t even close to how bad side effects have been on any other anti-seizure meds. I am definitely very drowsy, a little more irritable, moving slower, and feeling foggy. Have way less of an appetite and not eating early as much. I am having some headaches. Aside from that, I’m happy with this medicine so far. Finding the right medicine can be so frustrating and makes you feel so alone sometimes. Hoping this comment can help others as well!

9,Zonegran,Seizures,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 23, 2020",30,"Started taking 300 mg of Zonegran/Zonisamide my freshman year of high school and have been on it for 3 years. The drug is good at what it’s supposed to do- control seizures, however the side effects are getting so extreme that I’m in the process of changing medicine. Lost 60 lbs, hands/feet feeling tingly, slurred speech, getting agitated and more forgetful. Although those were tolerable and pretty mild, I started experiencing cloudy urine that would be incredibly painful and at this point, unbearable. If your thinking about taking this medication make sure to DRINK WATER!",wassup
10,Zonegran,Seizures,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"September 4, 2019",17,"Taking 800mg of Tegretol, 200mg of Pregabalin, 10mg of Clobazam & 100mg of Zonisamide twice a day plus 125mg of Primidone once at night didn’t work on me. Even after having part of my brain removed didn’t completely stop me from having seizures but increasing Zonisamide to 150mg twice a day thankfully stopped me having seizures in 2010, I’d suffered with them for 9 and a half years. Certainly would never reduce these - I got my life back in my thirties so can do all I used to. Cope with going to soccer matches alone & abroad alone, I didn’t even leave town I lived in alone when suffering with epilepsy. I live in the UK so lucky as do not pay for these.",Keanie
11,Zonegran,Seizures,10.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 28, 2018",15,I've been taking Zonegran for 12 or so years and have had no problems at all-not one seizure for years.  I  ride Motor cycles fast and not once have I had a problem.,Lots of them
12,Zonegran,Seizures,8.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 19, 2018",19,"This drug is great for seizures. I literally don’t have any when taking it. The only side effects I see is fatigue, and serious weight loss. I’m down 20 pounds from this drug.",Kay
13,Zonegran,Seizures,1.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 21, 2018",15,"I was really hoping Zonegran would be my golden ticket to no more complex partial seizures.  Instead, I’m having not only more, but have tinnitus.  The screeching in my ear is so loud I’d swear people can hear me coming.  I’m sure it’s fine for some, just not in my case.",Tess
14,Zonegran,Seizures,6.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 20, 2017",11,"Effective prevention of seizures, but I only had two episodes 16 months apart started at age 57.  Started at 25mg twice a day, increased to 50mg.  Was prescribed to go up to 100mg but requested to stay on the 50mg as I had no episodes and didn't like the effect it had on me.  I am now used to it but it makes me drowsy.Big downside is I have just found out that I have osteoporosis and it appears that zonegran is contributing to accelerated leeching of my bones.  Will be discussing with neurologist in a couple of weeks.",Nikinoo
15,Zonegran,Seizures,,Taken for less than 1 month,"October 9, 2017",35,"I took Zonegran (zonisamide) for approximately 4 weeks. That should tell you something. I knew by the third week that something was wrong with me.This drug ruined my thinking process. I got ""brain fog"", was unable to concentrate or focus on anything more than 2-3 minutes. I could not remember 50% of more of anything I read or was told. It made me depressed and discouraged and I completely lost interest in nearly everything. It began to effect me emotionally and I became extremely irritable at times. It also made me very sleepy and reduced my appetite tremendously.     *Worst of all, it did not stop my seizures. Zonegran must be one of, if not the worst anti-seizure  medications I've taken in my life. I don't recommend it.",dwenger86
16,Zonegran,Seizures,3.0,,"July 3, 2016",29,"This is one of the worst AEDs I've tried over the past 41+ years since surviving Reyes.  It caused hostility, agitation, nervousness, restless legs syndrome, suicidal thoughts, and made me so impulsive that I requested an early retirement from a position paying about $104k per year.  I probably would have not gone for retirement if the effects of the med had not been there.  To top things off it gave me gingival hyperplasia so my front teeth are ruined, gum overgrowth is worse than it has been while on any of the other 24 meds I've been given.  Intractable epilepsy is tough but this med might help persons who haven't had trauma or brain surgery.  FDA and the maker FAILED to warn me about this.  I got off of it.",stex
17,Zonegran,Seizures,2.0,,"June 30, 2016",13,"I first took it in 1984 as part of the study.  It was so, so, didn't work sufficiently and the epileptologist took me off of it for fear of kidney stones impacting a teenager.  When having major problems with Onfi and having tried 25+ meds over the past 41+ years I thought I'd see if Zonegran was improved.  A physician at Georgetown University in DC failed, like FDA, to proved information stating that the med can make a person who has had trauma and/or brain surgery go into orbit.  It controlled seizures a few months, made me do impulsive things like request retirement from a position paying over $104k/year.  It made me hostile, nervous, go nuts, and elevated my Dilantin level, caused gingival hyperplasia so my teeth are painful and ruined.",Bruan
18,Zonegran,Seizures,9.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"January 4, 2016",55,"I have taken Zonegran ( brand name only) for about 15 years I have been seizure free ALL 15 years. Prior to that I was on Topamax ( brand name only) I was seizure free 4 years I had one seizure in that time due to exposure to mold. Zonegran is the BEST medicine I have ever had. I do have word finding and short term memory issues that are frustrating and sometimes involuntary jerking of my limbs, as I'm trying to go to sleep. In all honesty, I would not use anything else. I don't have to worry about seizures. I just take the meds and live my life. So much so I am finally driving a car which is something I thought I would never do, because I didn't trust my meds!!",Wildreign
19,Zonegran,Seizures,8.0,,"June 26, 2015",17,"I took the medicine for 17 years after I had A VNS implant for my seizure disorder, the brand name medicine I considered to have the most positive experience in removing them overall, as the generic brand names had all side affects to my body by giving more seizure's & head aces .",Markus 1
20,Zonegran,Seizures,9.0,,"April 20, 2015",62,"I have been on Zonisamide for 5 years. I've tried several other medications to control my seizures but always switched due to side effects (hair loss, depression etc.). Zonisamide works the best so far for me! I love it! I haven't had a seizure in 5 years and I'm very happy with my quality of life! The only setback is my memory, I have word-finding issues big time! It gets very frustrating when I can see the person or the thing and not say the word. I have a Bachelor's degree in English, so you can imagine how annoying that is! But I would choose Zonisamide over anything else for sure! :)",JBuns

Some seizures still slip by for me but only when it's closer to my menstrual cycle or ovulation time, my seizures seem to be directly linked to fluctionations in my womanly cycles other than that this medicine has been the best one for me and has been a great relief to me.",Seizuregrlll

26,Zonegran,Seizures,10.0,,"October 9, 2013",86,"I have been taking Zonegran, 300mg/daily for 8 years. I have complex partial seizures that generalize about 90% of the time. I have tried just about every other medication out there and this is the only one that has kept my epilepsy under control. I do have side effects: some depression, anorexia (defined as loss of appetite). I started this medication weighing around 125lbs and now after three children weigh 105lbs and can't remember the last time I was hungry, and I have noticed that it is harder for me to retain information and I sometimes have to read things twice to understand them where before Zonegran I easily understood and retained information. Despite these side effects, I won't ever try a different medication. Totally worth it.",Emily G.

I'm normally a happy, positive & outgoing young woman. On Zonisamide I became extremely irritable & depressed. I flipped out over the littlest thing. I also lost a lot of weight because my appetite essentially disappeared. I weighed about 135lbs when I started and dropped to 113lbs. I finally had enough when the depression kicked in. I would have suicidal thoughts multiple times a day. It was scary and debilitating! I cried a lot, for no good reason.
