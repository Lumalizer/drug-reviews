1,Vimpat,Seizures,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 18, 2021",0,"I have been using this drug for years now, switched to this from levetiracetam because it would make me very drowsy everyday. Vimpat doesn't come with that side-effect and it does effectively prevent my nocturnal seizures. Unfortunately, there have been times where I either forgot or ran out of tablets and if I had stress during that time, relapses would occur. So, I don't see myself ever coming off this drug. As other people are saying, I have also been having trouble with speech and memory, and it's getting noticeably worse. Levetiracetam was also recommended as a memory-protecting drug but it causes too much drowsiness.",Anonymous

3,Vimpat,Seizures,1.0,,"October 14, 2021",0,Honestly one of the worst seizure medications I have ever been on I haven't been able to move my body all day the whole upper half of my body is locked up the whole entire time of taking this medication my shoulders was lock up occasionally and I just thought it was weird I didn't think it was from this medication I have also not been able to remember anything the first night I took this medication I vomited everywhere I feel like I'm spinning and I've been taking this medication for at least a month and a half. Do not let your doctor put you on this medication please trust me I have not been able to move all damn day. It also says it causes anxiety and I have BPD and all kinds of other issues so I'm pretty annoyed at my doctor it seems like all these neurologists aren't good at thinking. This medication is also extremely expensive and I have insurance even with insurance it was expensive this medication cost too much and it's completely ineffective it just caused me more pain than I was in,Anonymous

Thank goodness my insurance is straightened out you don't get held hostage for some ungodly out of pocket cost, depression suicide thoughts, can't drive sometimes.

It's worth noting that I also take Keppra. I find my seizures have gone WAY down and the ones I have are much weaker. However I have noticed a change in my thought process. Nothing I consider to be bad but definitely different.  If I had to describe it I now think in tie-dye.  For example one night I sat there thinking about ghosts. Simple enough, right?Well then I thought if when we die we are a spirit and spirits roam the world...what happens when everyone is dead? Are we all a bunch of spirits roaming earth? And if that's the case then when we look at meteors that used to be planets out in space, are the hunks of rock covered in spirits of other beings that once lived? So naturally I talked to a friend about this and we discovered that a side effect can be mania. However I don't feel manic. I just feel good, productive, happy.",RavenScy

14,Vimpat,Seizures,10.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 9, 2021",33,"I read through a lot of the negative reviews below and was really surprised. Vimpat has been the best medication for me. I've been taking it for almost 3 years and it has stopped my seizures and has way less side effects than any other ant-epileptic I've taken. The thing with finding the right drug for you is that you have to take into account literally everything in your life. With the most common type of epilepsy, seizures can be triggered by pretty much everything. On another note, titrating up on any anti-epileptic will cause side effects regardless of the drug. It's a matter of your body adjusting to the drug. Every time I titrated up a dose, I experienced side effects for about a month or so. BUT I've been on 400mg for over a year and have been fine, minus the unavoidable, occasional dizziness and vertigo. And the typical speech and memory problems come from having epilepsy, not necessarily from the drugs. Do your research! And if you have insurance, Vimpat is affordable.",Emily

I have epileptic form from the site of the surgery so I am at a higher risk of having seizure, so they are treating the epileptic form. I started with Keppra and that was a nightmare, Lamictal did not work either. I've been taking Vimpat for 4 months 50 mg twice a day. This is the worse medication ever. I have been feeling miserable for the last 4 months. The side effects I experienced are panic attacks, anxiety, tremors, cognitive problems, balance issues, dizziness, speech problems, problems coordinating my muscles to swallow, a very strange sensation in my throat and tongue, flushing, memory problems and nausea.

I felt terribly tired and could not cope with my daily activities. I had problems with speaking, my memory and my concentration got a lot worst. My sleep was badly affected. I had to quit my job and my social life. Every day was a struggle and I felt as if I had lost control of my own life !!!  This drug had a terrible impact on my life and DID NOT eliminate my seizures.   I now see that I am not the only one to have experienced those side-effects, though my previous doctor denied many of them. I still ask myself why my previous doctor is so fond of this drug????

I had nausea & threw up several times - taking it with food did not prevent this.I was on both Vimpat & Keppra at the same time (I was being weaned off Keppra then). For the first 3 weeks I would take both at the same time. When I would take them both I would end up with heart palpitations and I don't even have heart problems! I looked it up online since there was nothing about this in Vimpat's information pamphlet. When I did it said that heart palpitations are more likely to occur if you take Vimpat with Keppra. There is NOTHING about this interaction in either drug's information pamphlet. There should be. My neurologist didn't even know there was an interaction. I found out because I typed in ""Vimpat Heart Palpitations"" on Google. It was listed on a medical website. If the information I read is online why isn't it in the information pamphlets for both drugs?

Most of them had side effects ranging from dry mouth to memory loss where I have not been able to remember friends names or common words. The main problem was that I had to increase to such high levels that they were unsafe or my body seemed to develop a tolerance.  I have been on Vimpat for nearly a year now with very few of my symptoms which is amazing because without medication I would have problems every 1-2 minutes. The side effects are virtually negligible. My tongue and lips are a little numb when I take the tablets and I get headaches when the medication is altered. The major problem is the cost!,Blossom

We were getting VIMPAT dispensed from a larger opened bottle at our pharmacy. This bottle may have been open well outside of the shelf life per VIMPAT guidelines. We changed the prescription over to another pharmacy and started to receive an factory sealed bottle. I mentioned this because during the time of receiving VIMPAT from original pharmacy our 3 year old myoclonic seizure activity was not controlled. Our Doctor couldn't believe the VIMPAT wasn't working and increased dosage slowly.

101,Vimpat,Seizures,7.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 23, 2013",45,My uncle has had epilepsy since he was 18. He is now 60. He was on Dilanton up until 4 years ago when he was put on Depakote after a 45  minute seizure. Then no more until February. Then he started having seizures once a week. The doctor added Keppra. The seizures kept happening every couple weeks so the doctor sent him to a neurologist which maxed out the doses of both pills. Last month he had 4 lengthy seizures within 2 hour time period. That's when the doctor added Vimpat. As of today he has not had a seizure but the doc wants to up the Vimpat again. Since he has been on it he has had horrible memory loss. ,sad neice
