0,Phenytoin,Seizures,7.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"December 27, 2021",0,I was given phenytoin 300mg daily after my first seizure at 11 years old. I am now 68 and have been more or less seizure free for most of my life. However recently I have been suffering badly from neuropathic pain and numbness in my feet. I am going to have to find a good replacement drug as sadly the medication is now giving me very nasty side effects. Watch out if you take this for a long time but for years it’s been a very effective medication.,Rachael
