1,Diazepam,Seizures,9,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 31, 2021",0,"My 7 year old daughter has struggled with Myoclonic seizures since she was 3 years old. It is still not well controlled, and she has had a VNS implant and a Corpus Callosotomy brain surgery thus far. Nasal Diazepam, newly on the market, has helped my daughter drastically when those fearful moments of seizure clusters occur that just won't stop. Within 15 minutes, she seems back to normal, and isn't being controlled by the unfortunate seizures that are happening to her. This is the best Emergency seizure medication that has been prescribed to her thus far. I would like to add that my daughter's case of Myoclonic Seizures and Jeavons Syndrome have been very difficult to manage. But in those moments of desperation for ""a miracle,"" this Emergency medication is that answer for her.",Myoclonic seizu

3,Diazepam,Seizures,10,,"January 14, 2021",1,Diazepam is an amazing substance when used properly it can save the lives of many people with epilepsy or seizure disorders as it is fast acting and prevents seizures from reoccurring until you get emergency help itâ€™s great to have if your worried about having seizures,Anonymous
4,Diazepam,Seizures,9,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"November 23, 2020",9,"Valium (diazepam):I used to have focal onset seizures which came on very suddenly, and they would appear as panic attacks. My right leg would jump and jerk and so would my arm and fingers as I stood in a lineup anywhere, and these seizures would come on completely at random. They would happen at fast food outlets, or banks, or restaurants. They were more of a nuisance than anything drastic. I had a sudden attack in my vehicle whilst I was driving, and that was the last straw. I finally saw my GP, who prescribed me Valium for focal seizure control and anxiety control. I turned out to be amazing for both, and I'm feeling better than I've ever felt before! Valium does make you feel sleepy, and should never be mixed with alcohol though. Just exercise caution, and always use as directed.",Feelingbetternow
5,Diazepam,Seizures,10,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"September 4, 2020",7,Valium (diazepam):We have a cat that has seizures during the night usually early morning.  After talking to my vet and doing research we tried giving the valium. No more seizures during the last @ five years so due to running out of med we reduced med and he had 2 seizures this week. Going to try and get more med at vet. IT WORKS!!,Purdy get (my cat)

7,Diazepam,Seizures,10,,"January 12, 2017",11,"I was in the ER due to a series of seizures occurring once every 1-5 minutes. Within a few minutes, my cluster of seizures were no more. Long term, I couldn't give you an answer as this was only used during an emergency.",Mtmcmbe
8,Diazepam,Seizures,10,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"April 20, 2013",31,"I am 34 and have suffered from severe anxiety. To the point that I fear leaving home. In 2010, I started having seizures in my sleep. I have done everything every doctor has asked and nothing works other than diazepam and/or clonazepam. Yet, I am repeatedly refused prescriptions of either. I swear by it as I have no control considering we all need sleep. I am seizure and anxiety free with medication.",jessey820
9,Diazepam,Seizures,10,,"January 17, 2013",26,"I'm a recent college graduate, who was stricken with 2 grand mal seizures a month for over a year. They were so bad, that I racked up over 30k worth of medical bills. After all this, I went and talked to a bunch of neurologists. Many were garbage, and dictated treatment terms to me. I read a little bit, went to a bunch of doctors, and decided on my own course of action. I'm a male, 6 feet tall, and 150lbs. I started out on 20mg of Valium, and bumped up to 40mg; over the period of a year. It stopped my seizures cold, and didn't give me any side effects. It is, in my opinion, a miracle. ",J.J.J.
10,Diazepam,Seizures,5,,"July 24, 2012",18,Diastat AcuDial (diazepam):It works well to stop seizures when they come in clusters or they are long lasting. My 14 year old daughter uses it and its the only thing that helps when she's having a rough day.,Anonymous
11,Diazepam,Seizures,10,,"December 22, 2011",66,"Valium (diazepam):Wonder drug, stops seizures, stops things that can bring on a seizure, stops pain after seizures, stops bad side effects of my other anti-seizure medicines. I could not take any other seizure medicines but Valium helped. Not enough sleep can cause a seizure and Valium helps me sleep.",Anonymous
12,Diazepam,Seizures,7,,"May 29, 2009",27,Diastat (diazepam):Not the most pleasant medication to receive but I'm not a zombie after my seizures stop and it works fairly quickly.,Anonymous
