The only thing is reduced appetite, bit of moodiness and insomnia. I started taking Trileptal 300mg with the Keppra and it's worked wonders. It cancels out all the negatives of Keppra and helps me sleep which I can't do on Keppra alone.",Electrogirl
1,Levetiracetam,Seizures,8.0,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 22, 2022",0,Keppra (levetiracetam):I started having seizures when I was 35. I‘m now 72. I took Depakote for 35 years and was mostly successful in avoiding seizures although I did have periodic breakthrough events without warning. About two years I noticed I was getting frequent mouth infections. At this point the neurologist weaned me off of Depakote over a six week period and at the same time gradually increased the Keppra to 1500mg per day. For the first three weeks on Keppra I was tired and irritable but that soon subsided. I took a precautionary EEG as well. So far no seizures and no mouth infections.,JRC
2,Levetiracetam,Seizures,4.0,,"February 13, 2022",0,Keppra (levetiracetam):Not a big fan but I been taking it for over 2 years it's up to 1000mg night 750 morning no seizures but minor panic attacks and the mood swings are on and off if I miss 1 day or run out I am guaranteed to have seizure. I don't like it or the moods I went from add ADHD hype kid to sitting around doing nothing it's like take the meds to sit down and chill motivation reducer and mood swings if I could have never started the meds and have a seizure or 2 a year I would have did that instead taking all these meds everyday to miss 1 day and guaranteed to have a seizure is just backwards hard to move around freely taking all the meds,Average joe

Also had auras at times. After a mild seizure while walking for exercise 5-6 years the doc tried to switch me to Depakote and the problems began. I was switched back to Tegretol and Keppra 1000mg 2 x a day was added as a secondary drug. I have been seizure free for 6+ years and feel great. Only issue has been weight gain.",JImmy
4,Levetiracetam,Seizures,2.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"January 22, 2022",0,"Keppra (levetiracetam):I was on 3000mg per day for complex partial seizures ,mainly having absence variation. It only took a week of taking this stuff before horrific nightmares started occurring. Normally a very peaceful person and virtually nothing could upset me. On keppra more like a ticking time bomb. I distanced everyone from myself and went into complete isolation so that when the keppra rage came on no one was around. When it would hit it was literally like the rage and anger seen from the incredible hulk. Extreme anger and I felt I could destroy anything. Normally it hit during the night so I would grab on to the mattress tightly sweating profusely in a rage . Many times that would follow the horrible nightmares. I wound up quitting my job cause I couldn't function in the workplace while still having absence seizures and going in and out of consciousness. Don't let your neurologist convince you to go on this drug. It can have devastating effects and they will make no mention of that beforehand.",Tpakeppra

I took It for about 2 years I had missed a dose and ended right back in the ER. After that I made sure I took this medication everyday. I had no bad side affects and never went back too the ER.

6,Levetiracetam,Seizures,10.0,,"November 19, 2021",0,"This medication is used for my almost 17 year old son who was diagnosed with JME at 12. He had 3 tonic clinic seizures. Zero seizures for 3 years so neuro decided to attempt to wean him from meds. Two months after weaning at 15 yo, he had a relapse and was put back on 500mg twice a day. So far 1.5 years seizure free, he has his license. His younger brother experienced the same thing and has the same diagnosis. As for side effects, they both experienced the several weeks of severe mood swings. Physical activity helps a lot with that, we took lots of walks, played cards, drew, etc.. They both swim competitively and have full lives; play instruments, traveled to Europe (including jet lag) all seizure free with this med. We have been training them to be responsible with regular timers and discipline if they forget to take it. We are trying to set them up for success as adults.

After seizuring for 65 hours, Keppra was the only medication that made it stop.  For a month afterwards I found myself, a usually calm, patient person, totally grumpy and aggressive.  I did not like myself anymore.  I talked to my GP and she put me on Citalopram Hydrobromide, 20 mg once a day.  She felt it was anxiety and would take 4-6 weeks to help.  Within two days I was back to my old self.  I have continued to take both ever since and have had no side effects from either.  I told my new neurologist about this.  He was interested.",kteacher

I took Keppra 750mg twice a day for a few months. My kidneys couldn't handle it. I then stopped and tried again, ended up taking 500mg twice a day. I believe Keppra does stop seizures to some extent, although it causes side effects that are unbearable over time. The biggest issues were personality changes, I became a different human, lacked empathy, very moody and hardly happy. I did have bouts of aggression but for me, it was better than my previous aggressive issues before starting Keppra. Couldn't complete tasks, memory problems, libido problems, insomnia, lots of trouble focusing, I had no motivation & lots of sadness, my muscles ached, I couldn't train at the gym as much as I did before. I felt like I wasn't living my own life. I felt the cost of controlling seizures are just too high. It will work if you can live like a zombie.",Ellenor

ER did a bunch of tests,  saw nothing,  sent her home. Every day for a week after that,  she wouldn't have the seizures where you buck and shake,  but instead they would make her stare off almost like she was blind and speak jibberish. After day 7, I took her to ER, different hospital.  They kept her for 5 days doing test after test.  MRI,EEG, CT SCAN,  even a Lumbar puncture.  Nothing,  no answer.  Even the dr saw what was happening because she had an episode while at hospital.  She couldn't stop spitting up as well. I don't say vomit cause it was not food. They discharged her with a prescription of Keppra, 3 pills 2x a day.  I forget the mg, but seemed really high when they couldn't even give us a direct diagnosis.  (She is 19). About day 2 on Keppra ER, she was a completely different person.

It’s not what they do for epilepsy that should be debated with this medication it’s what they do to your mind, I was sooooo depressed but had never been depressed before so I just let it go on and on until one night I tried to take my own life, funnily enough with Keppra! If I was rating this medication on solely stopping seizures it would get a 10 but I think when they’re offering this out they should maybe balance it out with an anti depressant",Ted

After the fifth, I accepted a prescription for 500 mg tabs of levetiracetam. to be taken twice a day, morning and evening.  I purchased them, but cut the tabs in half, so I was taking only 250 mg twice a day.  This is half of what the MD recommended.  After three years, I have had no additional seizures (dislocations of my shoulder(s).  So, I guess it is working.  I have experienced none of the advertised side effects.

It causes severe confusion, nose bleeds, aggression, bad dreams & irritability to name a few. My dr was adamant that I needed it but when I finally forgot to take it one day I had a moment of clarity & looked up it’s side affects. I was floored that I was ever put on it. It was by far the worst experience I have ever had with a med, especially one I didn’t need! I weaned myself off of it and worry about long term effects from taking it for so long.

My husband commented on the change in my personality and how my mood changed for the worst. Keppra wasn’t added until I was 29 weeks, so the personality change was not pregnancy hormones. I reached a point where I started asking myself why I even thought getting pregnant was a good idea. What soon to be mother wants to think that!

All of my tests came back completely normal, save for slightly elevated blood pressure. I was put on Keppra 1000 mg, twice daily, as a result. I read up on how nasty the side effects allegedly were, but I found my personal experience with them quite underwhelming in comparison. Symptoms are definitely present though, chiefly gastrointestinal discomfort, irritability, restlessness, and feeling ""spaced out"". My most concerning symptom is that it has made it quite difficult to find things genuinely enjoyable like I used to. The best way that I can describe it is that it makes me feel robotic. Symptoms are obnoxious, yet manageable with some effort and patience. For seizures, I have not had any recurring episodes since being on it, so I can't say it's ineffective.",J

One doctor said that I was just depressed and wanted me to take depression pills. I sought a second opinion. It was discovered that I had a cyst in the temporal lobe of my brain. I was started on Topamax, which didn't really help. So my neurosurgeon switched me to Keppra. My attitude made an instant turn around from the third day I was taking it.
