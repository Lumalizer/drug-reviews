1,Topamax,Seizures,2.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 3, 2022",1,"I’m 25 years old and have tried many meds for my seizures. I had 3 brain surgeries and was on lamictal, vimpat and clobazam. I needed to go off of clobazam because my body was adjusting to the drug. I started Topamax and it improved my nighttime seizures and the side effect of weight loss was great because all others cause weight gain. I was weening onto it and was sent for bloodwork on the lamictal levels but the day after, my neurologist called. He said I needed to stop the topamax immediately because the average liver enzyme level is 50 and mine was at 1,000! I wasn’t feeling bad or anything but he is an experienced neurologist and said he had never heard of this happening to anyone before. It’s sad that it happened because it was decreasing the seizure frequency and the weight loss was working but it poisoned my liver. It sounds rare but it worked. In my case that why I rate it low.",Austin
2,Topamax,Seizures,9.0,Taken for 5 to 10 years,"August 3, 2020",6,I was given this medication Topamax because of seizures caused by migraines. My left and right eyes were sending signals to the Occipital part of the brain milliseconds apart. After over 20 years of bad migraines and seizures Topamax cured my problems and now I have seizures about twice a month rather than virtually every day. The seizures are far milder when they occur.,Chris

5,Topamax,Seizures,7.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 26, 2017",15,"I started taking this medication as soon as I was diagnosed with an inherited seizure disorder. Although I haven't had a seizure ever since I began to take the medication (which is good because the meds are working) the side effects were horrible. I would often feel very disoriented and saw a great amount of weight loss. This may not apply to everyone because everyone is different, but that was my experience with this medication.",nathalie2697
