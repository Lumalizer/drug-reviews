0,Oxcarbazepine,Seizures,8.0,,"March 26, 2022",0,"Trileptal (oxcarbazepine):300mg x2 a day of Trileptal caused water retention and swollen lymph nodes. However reducing it to 300mg along with Keppra 250mg x 2 a day has worked wonders for me. The Trileptal helps me sleep and helps with moodiness caused by Keppra. Keppra controls seizures very well. Overall, Trileptal is a great medication with little side effects. This combination of medicine is great for me.",Electrogirl
1,Oxcarbazepine,Seizures,8.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"February 8, 2022",0,"I am a 19 year old male, who was diagnosed with left temporal lobe epilepsy at the age of 5, and the cause is unknown. I had daytime complex partial seizures commonly, and nighttime grand mal seizures, rarely. I started with Keppra causing me to be violent and aggressive. I then switched to oxcarbazepine(Trileptal) and only had positive effects.  It stopped grand mal seizures but only slightly reduced the complex partial seizures.  My epilepsy is refractory and I may have surgery after they do an SEEG test to see what side my language is on. The partial seizures have symptoms of voices, fear, confusion, and goosebumps on left side of body. I should mention I was also born deaf in my left ear. The cause is also unknown because all the parts are functioning.",3309743032

I was on trileptal once before the last time but due to the low dosage the medication was ineffective. I went to a new doctor and he placed me back on trileptal but increased the dosage of the pill and that was the beginning of being 4 years seizure free and then I was given the news after 5 years that I had officially outgrew my epilepsy.,mads

Finally the disease took its toll and I had to accept the facts. The Trileptal is has been such a relief!

Trileptal though, just like its sister drug Tegretol. I could swear it gives me some kind of Bipolar disorder as a side effect combined with some kind of ADHD.

I developed epilepsy following a head injury (diving accident) when I was 8 years old. I've had seizures (daytime absence, daytime partial, nocturnal grand mal) since then.  Tegretol worked for me for years, then stopped working.  Trileptal has been my only seizure medication for the past 11 years and I couldn't be happier.

I found my daughter  on the floor. There was vomit on the bed and my daughter  was on the floor. It lasted 15 minutes. It was so scary. She was jerking very violently, and her eyes were rolling in the back of his head. It was horrible.  No one should have to see their child like that,  my doctor is saying she's had seizures. She had an MRI ,an EEG,they did a spinal tap. After returning from the hospital, my daughter experienced vomiting, I could not bear to see my daughter going through this problem at the early age of her life.

Her throat would burn inside and out, her face would flush, she would get dizzy and unable to focus. This would last about 5-10 min. and then she would get so tired, she would instantly fall asleep and sleep for hours.  She was at a pretty high dose during this time 1050mg 2x daily.  We finally stopped this medication, because of the stress of having to watch so closely when she ate and when she could take this medication.",Anonymous

Seizure characteristics changed/worsened, frequency & duration increased from every 4-10wks to weekly & from ~10min to ~15-45min w/ severe respiratory distress leading to numerous ambulance transports & hospitalizations. Though not ill, chronic respiratory distress developed such that O2 supplementation was required at 0.5lpm awake & 1.5-2lpm asleep. After >2mo of regular dosage increases following seizures, she was admitted to prolonged Video EEG following transport.

13,Oxcarbazepine,Seizures,6.0,,"July 17, 2016",42,"Trileptal (oxcarbazepine):I have temporal lobe seizures. I have taken Trileptal for many years and it has helped controlled the seizures. However; I have been having issues with low sodium. The doctors blame it on the Trileptal. So to fix the problem, they suggest eating high sodium foods, fluid restriction, and no water. Water dilutes the sodium. They also suggested that I add about a teaspoon of salt to my meals. So what I do for thirst is drink Gatorade but only a few sips. But you got to becareful and not to drink more than a liter of fluid in a day as this is what is recommended by the doctor. My neurologist recommended that I drink gatorade. So most of the time I drink Gatorade when I eat my meals.",Marge S
14,Oxcarbazepine,Seizures,,,"October 22, 2015",60,"Trileptal (oxcarbazepine):I have been on Trileptal for about a month now.  I'm taking 300 mg twice a day. I had an abnormal EEG and diagnosed with right-sided temporal lobe epilepsy. I started having pain 5 yrs ago -intense, daily pain in my right eye and eventually extended further up on the right side of my head (which is related to the epilepsy). I was also suffering from repeated inappropriate thoughts (of sexual nature) very disturbing and disrupted my life. I have since found out that OCD behavior very frequently accompanies temporal lobe epilepsy. Trileptal has stopped the partial sz and inappropriate thoughts. Indocin 25 mg is controlling the pain. Hope this helps others.",doglover68

Seizures have been controlled, so far, on 750mg AM and PM. I do feel somewhat tired until I get used to the dose and then the doc increase it again. He wants to get to 900 mg AM and PM.

Forgot to take it a few times and had seizures until I became very conscious of the need and since then I am quite well. I need to stay far from confrontations and conflicts.
