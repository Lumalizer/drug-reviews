0,Haldol,ICU Agitation,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 11, 2020",16,"My 17 year old son with severe autism was given Haldol during a pediatric ER visit. He is non-verbal and usually has severe anxiety in any healthcare setting. We took him to the ER because he appeared dehydrated after 24-36 hours of nausea, vomiting and behavioral symptoms that had become more severe. We informed the ER physician that he typically reacts the exact opposite to sedatives than should be expected and recommended one drug that has been effective in the past. A sedative was necessary in order to obtain a CT scan. The physician wanted to use Haldol because it has been effective with kids with autism and could also help my sons nausea. My son had no problem with the nurse setting up the IV which was not his norm. It did not take long after injecting this drug for him to go from calm, quiet and lethargic to needing 6-7 adults to subdue him and strap his wrists and ankles to his bed. What a joke!",Bob

2,Haldol,ICU Agitation,,,"August 23, 2010",67,"My father (now deceased) had a tendency to become agitated when confined to ICU for more than a couple of days.  He was prescribed Haldol during one such stay.  The medicine had a very negative effect; my father became aggressive.  One morning I walked in to find that the staff had strapped his hands to the bed overnight!I complained (loudly) to another doctor and my father was taken off Haldol and moved to a private room. Almost immediately he became the sweet, even-tempered man that I always knew. I tried to keep my dad out of ICU after that. ",Anonymous
