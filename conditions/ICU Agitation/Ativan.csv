0,Ativan,ICU Agitation,1,,"February 18, 2019",17,"I was given this for post op pain in recovery  instead of narcotics because a  anesthesiologist deemed me a drug user because I requested no morphine due to severe itching and scratching till I bled. I could not take ibuprofen due to renal disease. I WAS GIVEN 2mg ativan IV and told it was pain medication. I could feel every bit of the pain but could not speak...people were walking by me and would say she is asleep now but I was screaming inside.  All it did was drug me to the point I could not speak but could feel every bit of the pain.  on the way home from the hospital I went psychotic in the car trying to hurt other people. This left me with nightmares for 2-3 weeks, depression, anger and memory loss. It was not disclosed what was given until I kept pressing them because it was the worst surgical experience ever. The cover up was the worst. It hindered my healing from the surgery.",Peds4life
