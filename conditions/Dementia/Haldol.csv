0,Haldol,Dementia,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 16, 2021",8,"Dangerous for the elderly. My Mom was given this in a nursing home and I was called that she was not eating or drinking liquids for about 2 days. I found out that she was given Haldol. When I looked up the side effects of this drug, I realized that it was caused by the drug. I told the nursing home not to give her the drug anymore and about 24 hours later, she was able to eat and drink normally. Plus, her hands were shaking like someone who had Parkinsonâ€™s disease.",Jann
