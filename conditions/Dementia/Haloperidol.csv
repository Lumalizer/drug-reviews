0,Haloperidol,Dementia,1,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 16, 2021",8,"Haldol (haloperidol):Dangerous for the elderly. My Mom was given this in a nursing home and I was called that she was not eating or drinking liquids for about 2 days. I found out that she was given Haldol. When I looked up the side effects of this drug, I realized that it was caused by the drug. I told the nursing home not to give her the drug anymore and about 24 hours later, she was able to eat and drink normally. Plus, her hands were shaking like someone who had Parkinsonâ€™s disease.",Jann
1,Haloperidol,Dementia,1,,"September 28, 2017",22,"A 1.5 mg dose was given to my 88 year old father who has slight dementia and is bed bound from stroke and various other ailments ie advanced prostate cancer. He has a sunny disposition, although he was a bit upset that he had become bed bound. Natural reaction really. The palliative care nurse who saw him and prescribed it encouraged me to give it to him for 'anxiety' in a very general sense.After three weeks he became like a zombie, wouldn't do anything except lie there looking lost, no interest in the TV or politics which he loves. He became  extremely frail, shaking hands and completely incontinent. It scared us. It kept us the family up all night with the incontinence.It seems to be administered to keep the oldies quiet. I'm furious.",Riverleegirl

I took it last summer and man the feeling is haunting! I was on a beach vacation and I took the medicine b4 heading back out to the pool, not knowing about the scary side effects. In 30 min, I became unusually sleepy and went back to the room and Man I couldn't sleep! My legs were SO restless it wasn't funny! I felt like I had to explode outta my damn body! My mum massaged me till I fell asleep. Terrible medicine ",Aria9682
