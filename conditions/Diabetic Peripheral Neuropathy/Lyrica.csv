One morning @2 days later, I took a second dose of Lyrica a few hours after the first because my leg was hurting and had a bad reaction.  I blacked out, but was mumbling, seemingly had a seizure, was responsive, but didn’t remember anything. My husband took me to the ER. I woke up at 7:00 pm.  I thought I was making sense talking, but my husband said I wasn’t. There for 2 weeks.  Occupational therapist tested me daily - took that long for me to totally make sense, walk better, etc.  I still had trouble thinking of some words for about 2 months.  Once in a while I still have trouble with words now after 6 months.  I advise not using Lyrica if there is anything else you can take.",Pdlbc

My internist prescribed Lyrica. Tried it for about a month - no help. Went to a Neurologist who prescribed Tegretol 400 mg. Extended Release. Within a week my pain went from a 10 to a 2. Been taking one a day for over ten years with no side effects. Originally this med was developed for seizures but patients with neuropathy as well as seizures told their Docs that it helped with the neuropathy and thus  it is now used for this condition. Highly recommend it. Initially you may feel some sluggishness but within a very short time that goes away.",Mec

9,Lyrica,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"July 29, 2018",9,"What I've read so far in confusing. One said Lyrica can cause peripheral neuropathy, another said Lyrica was prescribed for it! I have diabetic peripheral neuropathy. I'm no longer a diabetic. I'm taking 100 mg of Lyrica twice a day, not sure it's really helping me.  Some days and night are so bad, I sleep sitting up on my couch. Don't like the dry mouth, dizziness, weight gain. I'm watching what I eat, some days certain foods bother me, other days same food doesn't bother me, very frustrating!! I don 't want to gain any more weight, afraid my diabetes will come back. I have had one treatment of botox, it helped so the pain is not as severe. DR. gave me very little medicine to start off with.

15,Lyrica,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,,"March 5, 2018",15,I have had diabetic neuropathy severe leg pain for 15 years. One year ago I started with Lyrica and it only helps fully if I take it with my Tramadol that I was previously on. Taking those two together gives me about 95% pain relief. Before starting Lyrica and tramadol I had been on gabapentin which after 3 years stopped working for me at all. As far as lyrica side effects I had immediate weight gain and increase in appetite and swollen feet legs hands face and fingers but I guess that's the price I had to pay because without the pain relief I finally received I would have soon killed myself.,Kimmyj
16,Lyrica,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 18, 2018",15,"I take 100 mg three times daily (TID) for diabetic neuropathy. I find while it lowers the pain, pins and needles, and burning sensation a good deal, it doesn’t eliminate them. I’ll take any improvement though. I previously took opiates which had about the same pain control but I developed tolerance, dependence, all the baggage that comes with opiates.I also tried gabapentin, which worked at high doses, but seemed to work sometimes but not others. It also took 2 hours or so to take effect. Lyrica is nearly instantaneous and reliable. It does make me high or drunk after taking it, sort of like marijuana mixed with benzos, but milder. It does mess with my short term memory and makes me clumsy. It also blurs my vision a bit. I’m still mostly functional though.  Overall it’s an ok tradeoff; moderate side effects for good pain control.",GoodMojo

I tried Gabapentin first, which was moderately effective. My doctor suggested Lyrica, which was only slightly better than Gabapentin. However, the Lyrica was effective enough @ 100 mg TID. Lyrica has a calming effect, and provides me a mild mood boost. It’s nowhere near as powerful as opiates though for pain control though.  I also accidentally discovered it all but eliminated opiate withdrawal. I was still restless, brain dead, and exhausted for a week, but almost all the other awful symptoms I had been through before in pain med withdrawal never materialized. Unwelcome side effects for me have been feeling drunk with blurred vision for a couple of hours after taking it. I’ve also stopped and restarted it, without major withdrawals.  I know some people have significant withdrawals from Lyrica, but I’ve not experienced that.",Anonymous

59,Lyrica,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,,,"June 9, 2009",70,"I was put on 50mg of Lyrica at age 62.  Within a week there was noticeable improvement in the amount of burning and tingling in my feet and legs. Within a month the burning and tingling disappeared. At 3 months I had gained 15 pounds at a rate of 5 pounds per month. Most importantly I began to notice I did not care if I lived or died. I stopped taking the drug. I have also experience this with antidepressants. For 6 months after stopping Lyrica I remained relatively free of pain. By 8 months the burning and tingling have returned at their full intensity. I rate the drug a 5, great for pain with serious side effects.",Anonymous
60,Lyrica,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,9.0,,"May 12, 2009",28,Lyrica has its pros and cons like any other medicine in the market. Lyrica has helped me in many ways including neuropathic pain and depression together with other antidepressants. The only side effect that bothers me a little is the fact that I feel tired most of the time but I can still function with a lot of calmness.On the other hand I have tried every single medicine for insomnia during the last 12 years with not so great results until I found this medicine. Now I sleep like a baby at 150mg twice a day.,hemaro

I am looking for an alternative for it as the cost to me is excessive.",Robert Webb
62,Lyrica,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,,"January 30, 2009",37,"I am on dialysis and now have neuropathy in my feet. I have tried many things and find Lyrica works but I have to take a low dose, only 75mg a day.  I have found that this low dose of Lyrica works well with 10mg of Vicodin.  My feet are tolerable and I can function without kicking my feet every millisecond and always thinking of the pain in my feet.  This combination works very well and I recommend it to all diabetic/dialysis neuropathic pain patients.",Anonymous
63,Lyrica,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,8.0,,"September 11, 2008",59,"I was prescribed 400mg/day of lyrica for severe peripheral neuropathy of my feet.  Prior to Lyrica I was taking 60mg/day of methadone with significant relief but with plenty of room for improvement.  With the addition of Lyrica to my Methadone regimen, my relief now stands at approx. 80% analgesia which is a God send considering the severity of my pain.  As a welcome side benefit, significant anxiety, hot flushes and insomnia were relieved as well.  For me, Lyrica has been something of a miracle drug.",Anonymous
64,Lyrica,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy,10.0,,"July 15, 2008",55,"Lyrica stops the pain in the ball of my feet. It's wonderful to be able to walk without the pain. I am diabetic and take insulin. I too have had a weight gain of 35 lbs over the past 6 months. I seem to suffer from a bit more memory loss than before and I fatigue easily. I have caught myself dozing off in front of the computer at work, so I force myself to get up and walk around a bit. All in all a small price to pay for the relief of the pain in my feet.",texaswanderer
